low voltage - activated ( lva ) t - type ca2 + channels activate in response to subthreshold membrane depolarizations and therefore represent an important source of ca2 + influx near the resting membrane potential .
in neurons , these proteins significantly contribute to control relevant physiological processes including neuronal excitability , pacemaking and post - inhibitory rebound burst firing .
three subtypes of t - type channels ( cav3.1 to cav3.3 ) have been identified , and using functional expression of recombinant channels diverse studies have validated the notion that t - type ca2 + channels can be modulated by various endogenous ligands as well as by second messenger pathways .
in this context , the present study reveals a previously unrecognized role for cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( cdk5 ) in the regulation of native t - type channels in n1e - 115 neuroblastoma cells , as well as recombinant cav3.1channels heterologously expressed in hek - 293 cells .
cdk5 and its co - activators play critical roles in the regulation of neuronal differentiation , cortical lamination , neuronal cell migration and axon outgrowth .
our results show that overexpression of cdk5 causes a significant increase in whole cell patch clamp currents through t - type channels in n1e - 115 cells , while sirna knockdown of cdk5 greatly reduced these currents .
consistent with this , overexpression of cdk5 in hek - 293 cells stably expressing cav3.1channels upregulates macroscopic currents .
furthermore , using site - directed mutagenesis we identified a major phosphorylation site at serine 2234 within the c - terminal region of the cav3.1subunit .
these results highlight a novel role for cdk5 in the regulation of t - type ca2 + channels .

cav channels have been traditionally classified into high voltage - activated ( hva ) and low voltage - activated ( lva ) subtypes [ 1 ] .
hva channels activate at relatively depolarized potentials and comprise l - , p / q - , n - , and r - types .
lva channels , also known as t - type , are critically important for regulating neuronal excitability , pacemaking and post - inhibitory rebound burst firing [ 2 ],[ 3 ] .
therefore , it should not come as a surprise that t - type channel hyperactivity has been associated to human neurological disorders such as absence epilepsy and neuropathic pain [ 4 ],[ 5 ],[ 6 ],[ 7 ] .
three different t - type channels , cav3.1 , cav3.2 and cav3.3 , have been cloned and expressed from mammals [ 1 ],[ 2 ] .
using recombinant channels diverse studies have validated the idea that cav3 channels can be modulated by various endogenous ligands as well as by second messenger pathways .
hence , it has been reported that ca2 +/ cam - dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) differentially regulates the activation of cav3 channels [ 8 ] , and that protein kinase a ( pka ) and pkc increase cav3 current density [ 9 ],[ 10 ],[ 11 ] .
however , it remains unknown whether other kinases play a role in modulating cav3 channel function .
interestingly , it has been shown that the inhibition of the cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( cdk5 ) favors neurotransmitter release via enhancement of p / q - type channel activity [ 12 ] .
cdk5 seems to phosphorylate the intracellular loop that connects the second and third repeated domains in the cav2.1alpha1 pore - forming subunit of the channels , affecting its interaction with snap - 25 and synaptotagmin [ 12 ] .
likewise , recent evidence suggests that the n - type channel , the other major presynaptic ca2 + channel , is also a substrate of cdk5 .
in this case , phosphorylation of the cav2.2alpha1 pore - forming subunit by cdk5 facilitates neurotransmitter release increasing ca2 + influx by enhancing channel open probability [ 13 ] .
cdk5 is a neuron - specific , proline - directed serine / threonine kinase that forms a complex with its activators p35 or p39 .
diverse studies have shown that the complex of cdk5 and its activators has multiple functions in immature neurons including migration , differentiation and synaptogenesis [ 14 ],[ 15 ] .
although the physiological role of cdk5 in mature neurons is less clear , it has been suggested that several proteins of the soluble n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein ( snap ) receptor ( snare ) required for efficient neurotransmitter release may act as physiological substrates of cdk5 .
likewise , it has been documented that proteolytic cleavage of p35 may produce p25 , which accumulates in the brain of patients with alzheimer 's disease [ 13 ],[ 16 ] .
furthermore , increased proteolysis of p35 is linked to abnormal tau phosphorylation and promotes neuronal apoptosis [ 17 ] .
in the present study we analyzed cav3.1 channels for potential phosphorylation by cdk5 .
we report that cdk5 can directly phosphorylate cav3.1 channels at serine 2234 and that this in turn modulates depolarization - dependent ca2 + entry .
materials and methods cell cultures mouse neuroblastoma - derived n1e - 115 cells ( american type culture collection ; atcc number crl - 2263 ) were grown in culture using dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium plus 25 mm glucose ( dmem - hg ) culture medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 2 mm l - glutamine , and penicillin - streptomycin ( 100 u / ml ) .

data analysis activation of the currents was well described by a boltzmann relation of the form g / g max = 1 /{ 1 + exp [( v - v ( 1 / 2 ))/ k ]} , where g is peak conductance , g max is fitted maximal g , v ( 1 / 2 ) is half - activation voltage , and k is the slope factor .
steady - state current inactivation curves were fitted with the following equation : i / i max = 1 /( 1 + exp ( - ( v p - v ( 1 / 2 ) inact )/ k )) , where i / i max is the normalized peak current , v p is the conditioning prepulse , v ( 1 / 2 ) inact is the voltage for half - inactivation and k is the slope factor .
time constants of activation ( tauact ) and inactivation ( tauinact ) were obtained , using 140 ms test pulses , from single exponential fits to the raising and decaying phases of the currents .
cdk5 gene silencing by specific sirnas n1e - 115 cells were seeded in 35 - mm dishes ( at ~ 80 % confluence ) and transfected with a 100 - pmol mixture of predesigned synthetic small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) that target cdk5 or with a non - targeting sirna as negative control ( sigma - aldrich ) using lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent ( invitrogen ) .

results to investigate whether t - type ( cav3 ) channels are substrates of cdk5 , we initially conducted whole - cell patch clamp recordings in the clonal neuroblastoma cell line n1e - 115 which express prominent ca2 + currents through cav3 channels [ 22 ],[ 23 ] .
these transient inward currents ( fig. 1a ) were evoked by a step depolarization from a holding potential ( v h ) of - 80 mv to potentials more positive than - 50 mv , and the current amplitude became maximum around - 25 mv ( fig. 1b ) .
likewise , when preceded by a 1 s conditioning pulse to - 30 mv to inactivate the t - type component , step depolarizations failed to evoke the long - lasting component of the current previously observed in n1e - 115 cells induced to differentiate into mature neurons [ 22 ],[ 23 ] , suggesting that the contribution of l - type channels to the whole - cell current in non - differentiated n1e - 115 cells is negligible ( fig. 1a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0119134.g001 fig 1 regulation of native t - type ca2 + channels by cdk5 .
a ) cdk5 transfection significantly increases t - type current amplitude in neuroblastoma n1e - 115 cells .
currents were evoked by step depolarizations applied to test potentials of - 30 mv from a holding potential ( v h ) of - 80 mv .
ba2 + ( 10 mm ) was used as the charge carrier .
b ) normalized current density - voltage relationships in control and transfected cells with cdk5 / p25 in the absence and presence of the cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine ( 50 mum ) , obtained by application of 140 - ms voltage steps to various test potentials ranging from - 60 to + 60 mv from a v h of - 80 mv. peak currents were normalized by membrane capacitance ( current density , pa.pf ) to eliminate cell size as a variable .
c ) cdk5 / p35 effect on t - type channels did not alter the voltage dependence of current activation and steady - state inactivation .
the normalized curves were fit by a single boltzmann as described in methods .
d ) cav3 channel expression in n1e - 115 cells .
total rna was isolated and reverse transcribed .
amplified products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis .
actin was included as a positive control .
rna samples transcribed in the absence of reverse transcriptase ( - rt ) were used as negative controls to exclude genomic contamination .
mouse brain ( mbrain ) was used as a positive control .
the potential effects of cdk5 on the capacity of t - type cav channels to conduct current were then examined using also whole - cell recordings in n1e - 115 cells transfected with the cdk5 plus its activator p35 cdnas .
using ba2 + as the charge carrier , we found that following transfection with cdk5 / p35 , the peak current amplitude ( fig. 1a ) and current density were significantly increased (> 2 - fold ) when compared to the control condition ( fig. 1b ) .
the possible role of cdk5 / p35 on t - type current regulation was supported by using the inhibitor olomoucine ( 50 mum ) , which fully prevented the effect of the kinase on the macroscopic currents .
inward currents were measured and expressed as peak current density ( pa / pf ) to account for variations in cell size and the current density - voltage relationships were normalized ( fig. 1b ) .
given that changes in current amplitude could result from changes in channel gating , the voltage - dependent properties of the currents were assessed in these cells .
activation of the channels was well described by a boltzmann relation of the form g / g max = 1 /{ 1 + exp [( v - v ( 1 / 2 ))/ k ]} , where g is peak conductance , g max is fitted maximal g , v ( 1 / 2 ) is half - activation voltage , and k is the slope factor .
as shown in fig. 1c , for control ( gfp - transfected ) cells , v ( 1 / 2 ) was - 37.5 mv ( n = 13 ) , which was not significantly different from that of cdk5 / p35 - transfected cells ( - 38.6 mv , n = 19 ; p > 0.05 , student 's t - test ) .
the slope factors for the boltzmann fits were also similar .
likewise , the voltage - dependent properties of inactivation were determined by applying 1 s conditioning pre - pulses that ranged successively from - 80 to - 20 mv in 10 mv voltage steps , followed by a 140 ms step depolarization to - 30 mv. the relationship of normalized test pulse voltage to peak current amplitude was plotted against its corresponding v h and fitted with the boltzmann equation ( fig. 1c ) .
the voltage dependence of inactivation was similar for currents recorded from control and cells expressing cdk5 ( fig. 1c ) .
for control cells , v ( 1 / 2 ) was - 56.7 mv ( n = 13 ) , which was not significantly different from that of cdk5 / p35 transfected cells ( - 58.7 mv , n = 19 ; fig. 1c ) .
the slope factors were also similar .
these results indicate that cdk5 augmented the density for currents carried by native t - type channels but had no apparent effect on either the activation or inactivation properties .
we next examined whether one or more of three known members the t - type channel subfamily ( cav3.1 , cav3.2 and cav3.3 ) were expressed in n1e - 115 cells .
to this end , total rna isolated from n1e - 115 cells was isolated and sequence - specific primers were designed to target cav3 channels in rt - pcr experiments .
as previously reported [ 24 ] and corroborated here , single cav3.1 and cav3.2 products of the expected sizes can be selectively amplified from n1e - 115 cells using rt - pcr ( fig. 1d , upper panel ) .
in addition , no significant expression of cav3.3 mrna could be detected .
in contrast , evidence for the expression of the three cav3 channel isotypes were found in the total rna obtained from the mouse brain used as control ( fig. 1d , lower panel ) .
to confirm that cdk5 manipulation affected t - type current density , we next performed cdk5 knockdown experiments using small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) .
we first verified efficient and specific knockdown of the kinase in n1e - 115 cells using semi - quantitative western blot analysis with an anti - cdk5 antibody ( fig. 2a - b ) .
loading controls were monitored with an anti - actin antibody .
the anti - cdk5 antibody recognized a 32 - kda protein in n1e - 115 cell line , as well as in mouse brain lysates and in hek - 293 cells ( fig. 2a ) .
our analysis of protein expression levels confirmed a significant decrease (~ 70 %) in the levels of cdk5 protein after knockdown .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0119134.g002 fig 2 knockdown of endogenous cdk - 5 decreases t - type ca2 + channel functional expression .
a ) n1e - 115 cells were transfected with cdk5 sirna and analyzed 48 h later by western blot with specific antibodies , verifying sirna - mediated reduction of endogenous cdk5 .
b ) densitometry quantification of cdk5 protein in control and sirna cdk5 - transfected cells ( n = 3 ) .
asterisk denotes a significant difference at p < 0.05 .
c ) comparison of normalized current density - voltage relationships in control and sirna transfected cells .
ba2 + ( 10 mm ) was used as the charge carrier .
d ) cdk5 silencing did not alter the voltage dependence of current activation and steady - state inactivation .
interestingly , whole - cell recordings of n1e - 115 cells transfected with cdk5 sirnas for 48 h showed a significant decrease (~ 20 %) in t - type current density compared with scrambled sirna transfected cells .
scaled current density - voltage relationships confirmed that cdk5 knockdown has an inhibitory effect on t - type current density in n1e - 115 cells ( fig. 2c ) .
the discrepancy between the efficiency of the cdk5 knockdown ( protein decrease of ~ 70 %) and its effect on the t - type channels ( current reduction of ~ 20 %) suggests that there might not be a linear relationship between the silencing of cdk5 and its effect on t - current density .
this is not unexpected given that posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation work in a non - stoichiometric manner .
in this particular case , the amount of cdk5 remaining after knockdown still could be phosphorylating a substantial proportion of channels .
in addition , the cav3.1 channels conduct current even in the absence of cdk5 - dependent phosphorylation , as could be found for the mutant cav3.1 channels ( see below ) .
last , voltage - dependent properties of activation and inactivation of the t - type currents were examined in transfected n1e - 115 cells , and the results showed that there were no differences in the half - maximal activation ( v ( 1 / 2 )) and slope factors ( k ) of steady - state activation or inactivation between cdk5 sirna - transfected and control cells ( fig. 2d ) .
since t - type channels have been implicated in neuronal differentiation [ 25 ] , and manipulating cdk5 could be an opportunity to better understand their role during this period , the role of cdk5 on cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( camp ) - induced differentiation of the neuroblastoma - derived n1e - 115 cells was studied using olomoucine ( olo ; 50 mum ) .
the results of these experiments show that the use of this cdk5 competitive antagonist prevented the effect of camp ( fig. 3a ) .
to characterize this effect , neurite incidence and average neurite length were monitored for 48 h in the absence and presence of olo .
neurite incidence increased at the same rate and kept rising until 48 h. in contrast , neurite length increased to an average of ~ 170 mum in the control condition but stopped at 48 h in olo - treated cells , averaging < 100 mum ( fig. 3b ) .
consistent with this , cell membrane capacitance , determined for these cells as an index of cell size , was smaller in the cells incubated 48 h with olo ( fig. 3c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0119134.g003 fig 3 cdk5 inhibits t - type ca2 + channel functional expression and affect camp - mediated n1e - 115 cell differentiation .
a ) inhibition of neurite outgrowth by the specific cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine ( olo ) in n1e - 115 differentiated with cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( camp , 2 mm ) for 48 h. phase contrast micrographs of cells grown in the absence or presence of olo ( 50 mum ) .
b ) comparison of neurite outgrowth from n1e - 115 cells kept in culture in the absence ( control ) and presence of olo .
neurite analysis was carried out with imagej software ( nih ) .
c ) comparison of the c m values in camp - differentiated n1e - 115 cells kept in culture in the presence or the absence of olo .
d ) representative superimposed trace currents recorded in response to 1 s depolarizing pulses to - 30 mv from a v h of - 80 mv ( to evoke lva channel activity ) , and to + 10 mv at the end of the 1 s lva current inactivating pulses ( to evoke the hva component of the current ) in camp - differentiated n1e - 115 cells in the presence or the absence of olo ( left panel ) .
comparison of the percentage of peak current densities through hva and lva channels ( right panel ) .
data are given as mean +/ - s.e.m. e ) comparison of the time constant of current and inactivation ( tauinact ) at - 30 mv in camp - differentiated n1e - 115 cells in the presence or the absence of olo as in d. in order to obtain proof for the t - type ( cav3 ) channel involvement in this process , we next performed whole - cell patch clamp recordings in camp - differentiated n1e - 115 cells in the absence and the presence of olo ( 50 mum ) .
using ba2 + as the charge carrier , we found that treatment with olo ( 48 h ) significantly inhibited (~ 30 %) current density when compared to the control condition ( fig. 3d ) .
as mentioned earlier , it has been reported that l - type ( cav1 ) channels may be expressed in differentiated nie - 115 cells .
therefore , the possibility exists that the over - expression of cdk5 / p35 might induce their functional expression .
to explore this possibility , the effect of cdk5 / p35 on hva cav channel expression was examined using whole cell patch clamp recordings in nie - 115 camp - differentiated cells .
to this end , a standard protocol was employed .
first , a 1 s depolarizing step to - 30 mv from a v h of - 80 mv was applied to activate and inactivate the low voltage - activated ( lva ) component of the macroscopic current but not activate hva channels .
next , a second activating voltage step to 0 mv was applied to activate hva channels [ 26 ] .
the results of this analysis suggested that a small amount (~ 10 %) of hva ( including l - type ) inward current could be detected in nie - 115 cells under differentiating conditions ( fig. 3d ) .
interestingly , this component of the macroscopic current was not affected by olo treatment .
in contrast , the lva component of the ca2 + current was sensitive to the drug treatment .
in the presence of olo the lva current density was significantly reduced from ~ - 4.5 pa / pf in the control to ~ - 3 pa / pf ( fig. 3d ) .
it should be noted here , that the cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine ( ro ) has also shown to affect cav3.1 channel activity .
specifically , the drug seems to inhibit these channels in part by stabilizing the closed - inactivated state [ 27 ] .
in addition , it has been reported that ro affects cav2.2 ( n - type ) current kinetics [ 28 ] .
however , this effect appears to be specific for ro since it is not present after olo treatment [ 28 ] , which points to distinct mechanisms of action .
the differential effects of these two closely related cdk5 inhibitors may also be true for the cav3.1 channels , where we found that current inactivation kinetics in control cells and cells treated with olo did not differ significantly ( fig. 3e ) .
although it is likely that the current recorded in n1e - 115 cells may be mediated by cav3.1 , cav3.2 , or both channels , in a previous report we showed that the transcription factor sp1 can regulate cav3.1 promoter activity and that sirna - mediated sp1 silencing significantly decreased the level of cav3.1 protein and reduced the amplitude of whole - cell t - type currents expressed in the n1e - 115 cells [ 29 ] .
these results indicated that cav3.1 channels greatly contribute to determine ca2 + macroscopic currents in these cells .
consequently , we next investigated the functional significance of cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation on whole - cell currents recorded in hek - 293 cells stably expressing cav3.1 channels and transiently transfected with the cdnas encoding for cdk5 and p35 .
however , before exploring this point , in an initial series of experiments , cell lysates from mouse brain , n1e - 115 , and he - 293 cells were subjected to western blot analysis using anti - cdk5 and anti - p35 to detect the expression of endogenous cdk5 and p35 proteins .
the results of these experiments revealed bands corroborating the expression of endogenous cdk5 ( fig. 4a ) and p35 in all samples analyzed .
however , given that the expression of p35 has not been detected previously in the hek - 293 cell line [ 30 ],[ 31 ] , we decided to verify its expression at the level of mrna in rt - pcr experiments using the same set of specific oligonucleotides as in fig. 1a .
unexpectedly , our results showed no specific p35 mrna amplification in hek - 293 cells .
although there are some possible explanations for the discrepancy between the data obtained by western blot and rt - pcr , the actual reasons for these conflicting results remain presently unknown .
however , given that in all experiments examining the effect of cdk5 phosphorylation on cav3.1 channels performed in hek - 293 cells , p35 was co - transfected with the kinase and the channels , whether or not p35 is endogenously expressed in this cell line does not affect the results of this study .
additional studies are needed to unambiguously demonstrate the expression of p35 in the hek - 293 cell line .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0119134.g004 fig 4 regulation of heterologously expressed cav3.1 channels by cdk5 .
a ) protein extracted from mouse brain ( mbrain ) , n1e - 115 cells , untransfected hek - 293 cells as well as stably expressing cav3.1 channel cells were analyzed by western blot using specific antibodies for cdk5 ( upper panel ) and its activator p35 ( lower panel ) .
b ) immunofluorescence analysis of hek - 293 cells stably expressing cav3.1 channels .
the confocal image illustrates the expression of the channels ( green ) both in the plasma membrane and the cytosol .
cells were fixed and stained with a polyclonal anti - cav3.1 antibody .
c ) representative macroscopic current traces recorded from hek - 293 cells stably expressing cav3.1 channels in the control condition and after transfection with plasmids encoding cdk5 and p35 .
currents were elicited by depolarizing steps from a v h of - 80 | mv to - 30 | mv .
ca2 + ( 10 mm ) was used as the charge carrier .
d ) comparison of normalized current density - voltage relationships in control and cdk5 / p35 transfected hek - 293 cells .
we further confirmed the expression of cav3.1 in the surface of transfected hek - 293 cells by immunofluorescence .
as indicated by the green fluorescence signal in fig. 4b , we found that the cav3.1 channels show a distribution pattern consistent with predominant plasma membrane expression , though there was also signal associated to cytoplasmic organelles .
likewise , representative current traces elicited near the half - maximal ( - 30 mv ) channel activation are shown in fig. 4c .
remarkably , a ~ 1.5 - fold increase in current density was observed in cells transfected with cdk5 / p35 for 48 h ( n = 28 ) in comparison with control cells .
scaled current density - voltage relationships confirmed that co - expression of the cdk5 / p35 complex has a stimulatory effect on current density in these cells ( fig. 4d ) .
in contrast to the significant effect of cdk5 / p35 on current density and in conductance ( fig. 5a - b ) , the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation was not significantly altered ( fig. 5c ) .
in addition , the time constants for current activation and inactivation were not also significantly modified ( fig. 5d ) .
these data are consistent with the results from the recordings obtained in n1e - 115 cells ( figs. 1c and 3e ). with a view to gaining further insight into the mechanisms by which cdk5 is affecting cav3.1 channel currents , we examined whether the surface expression of the cav3.1 channel protein was altered .
to this end , we measured the expression of the channels in plasma membrane protein extracts. by using the membrane - bound adhesion molecule e - cadherin as a control , we found a significant increase in cav3.1 subunit in hek - 293 cells transiently co - transfected with cdk5 / p35 compared with the control ( fig. 5e - f ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0119134.g005 fig 5 regulation of recombinant cav3.1 protein membrane expression by cdk5 .
a ) representative macroscopic current traces recorded from hek - 293 cells transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding cav3.1 channels alone or in conjunction with plasmids encoding cdk5 and p35 .
currents were elicited by depolarizing steps from a v h of - 80 | mv to - 30 | mv .
ba2 + ( 2 mm ) was used as the charge carrier .
b ) conductance - voltage ( g - v ) curves were calculated for each cell .
an increase in conductance was observed in cdk5 / p35 - coexpressing cells .
c ) cdk5 / p35 overexpression in hek - 293 cells stably expressing cav3.1 channels did not affect the voltage dependence of current activation and steady - state inactivation .
d ) comparison of the time constant of current activation ( tauact ) and inactivation ( tauinact ) at different membrane voltages in untransfected ( control ) and cdk5 / p35 - coexpressing cells .
e ) representative cell surface protein extraction assay followed by western blot using an anti - cav3.1 specific antibody .
f ) densitometric quantification of three repetitions of the experiment shown in e. asterisk denotes significant differences ( p > 0.05 ) between cells expressing the cav3.1 channels only , and cells transfected with the channels plus the cdk5 / p35 complex .
in parallel , we searched for the presence of the consensus sequence for cdk5 phosphorylation [ 32 ] in the cav3.1 channel sequence using the database publicly available at the url http :// gps.biocuckoo.org / .
we found several sites in cav3.1 as possible cdk5 substrates .
this analysis showed four sites t539 , t541 , s2232 , s2234 , with high scores ( 11.9 , 11.2 , 11.4 and 11.7 , respectively ) .
the first two sites were located in the i - ii loop of the cavalpha1 subunit while the other two were in the c - terminal of the protein .
in particular , serine 2234 was identified as the major site of cdk5 phosphorylation ( fig. 6a ) because it was conserved among species and the last amino acid in the consensus site corresponded to a lysine .
the identity of this site as a possible cdk5 substrate was further confirmed using a novel systematic computational search strategy for putative phosphorylation sites for cdk5 in the mouse proteome developed previously by our research group [ 33 ] .
this strategy uses a position specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) based on a manually curated dataset of sites shown to be phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro by cdk5 .
due to the highly stringent filtering criteria the use of this strategy significantly reduces the number of false positives [ 33 ] .
pssm analysis showed that the serine residue at position 2361 in the mouse cav3.1 sequence ( s2234 in the rat sequence ) has a very high score as putative site for cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation , and it is likely to be phosphorylated based on the results of phosphoproteomics studies of the mouse brain .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0119134.g006 fig 6 phosphorylation of the cav3.1 channel in vitro at serine 2234 .
a ) amino acid sequence alignment of a small region within the cav3.1 channel c - terminus showing a consensus cdk5 phosphorylation site conserved among three species .
the box marks the sequence that matches the cdk5 consensus site with the phosphorylatable serine at position 2234 .
direct dna sequencing of pcr products confirmed that the construct generated by site - directed mutagenesis of the cdk5 consensus phosphorylation site contained the mutant sequence .
b ) for in vitro cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation assays gst - cav3.1 fusion wild - type ( wt ) and s2234a mutant proteins were purified on glutathione agarose beads , fractionated by sds - page and stained with coomassie blue .
c ) purified recombinant cav3.1 wild - type and s2234a constructs ( amino acid residues 2154 to 2254 ) were subjected to phosphorylation by purified cdk5 / p25 complex in vitro .
d ) comparison of the relative in vitro phosphorylation levels gst - cav3.1 fusion wt and s2234a mutant proteins ( n = 3 ) .
to determine whether this site is phosphorylated by cdk5 , we generated a point mutation in which serine 2234 was substituted with alanine by site - directed mutagenesis .
carboxyl - terminal gst fusion proteins containing the region of interest were then generated , expressed in bl21 cells and purified for analysis using an in vitro phosphorylation assay .
coomassie blue gel staining showed that the total proteins of the lysate applied in each lane of the gels were very similar ( fig. 6b ) .
interestingly , pro - q diamond gel staining showed that cdk5 phosphorylated the wild - type c - terminus cav3.1 gst fusion protein , whereas the s2234a mutant construct displayed low levels of phosphorylation ( fig. 6c - d ) .
we next tested whether the s2234 might be a functional cdk5 phosphorylation site , by performed site - directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological recordings .
first , a construct encoding the full - length cav3.1 cdna was transfected transiently into hek - 293 cells , and the resulting channels were studied using the whole - cell patch clamp technique .
it is worth mentioning that the transfected channels expressed well in hek - 293 cells ( fig. 7a ) , had current densities similar to those obtained with the stably transfection , and produced typical current waveforms expected from t - type cav3.1 channels .
as expected , current density was conspicuously larger in cells cotransfected with cdk5 / p35 at almost all voltages tested ( fig. 7b ) , but no differences in current kinetics were evident .
consistent with this , activation curves showed a significant ~ 1.5 - fold increase in conductance in the cells coexpressing cdk5 / p35 , though scaled activation curves did not differ significantly in the absence and presence of cdk5 / p35 ( fig. 7c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0119134.g007 fig 7 mutation of serine 2234 abolishes cdk5 / p35 - mediated regulation of cav3.1 channels .
a ) representative macroscopic current traces recorded from hek - 293 cells transiently transfected with plasmid constructs encoding wild - type and s2234a mutant cav3.1 channels alone or in conjunction with plasmids encoding cdk5 and p35 .
currents were elicited by depolarizing steps from a v h of - 80 mv to - 30 mv .
ba2 + ( 2 mm ) was used as the charge carrier .
b ) comparison of normalized current density - voltage relationships in wild - type and s2234a mutant cav3.1 channel transfected hek - 293 cells in the presence or absence of the cdk5 / p35 complex .
c ) cdk5 / p35 coexpression in hek - 293 cells expressing the wild - type and s2234a mutant channels did not affect the voltage dependence of current activation .
the normalized g - v curves were fit by a single boltzmann as described in methods .
data analysis showed negligible differences in v ( 1 / 2 ) or the slope factor ( k ) .
d ) the cav3.1 t - type channels and the cdk5 / p35 complex may interact resulting in a cdk5 / p35 - mediated increase in channel cell surface expression and current density , via a functional phosphorylation site at s2234 located within the c - terminus of the cav3.1alpha1 protein .
based on the in silico analysis and the in vitro phosphorylation assay , we hypothesized that cav3.1 activity would be dependent on the phosphorylation state of ser2234 .
accordingly , cdk5 would not be expected to increase currents carried by cav3.1 channels harboring the mutation .
this was confirmed in whole cell patch clamp experiments performed in hek - 293 cells transiently transfected with the wild - type or the mutant cav3.1 channel cdna alone or in conjunction of the cdk5 cdna .
as shown in fig. 7a and 7b , ser2234 mutant cav3.1 channels were refractory to modulation by the cdk5 / p35 complex .
likewise , as observed in currents recorded through native t - type channels in n1e - 115 cells and recombinant cav3.1 channels stably expressed in the hek - 293 cell line , the voltage dependence of activation of the currents through cav3.1 mutants did not differ significantly from that observed with the wild type channels , both in the absence and presence of cdk5 / p35 ( fig. 7b ) .
no differences in voltage dependence or current kinetics were evident .
discussion diverse studies have shown that cdk5 has multiple functions in the developing , adult , and aging brain , and that a change in its localization from the growth cones to the presynaptic terminals is an important mechanism underlying the diversity of functions cdk5 plays in nerve cells [ 34 ],[ 35 ],[ 36 ] .
however , little is known concerning the regulatory effects of this kinase on ca2 + channels , essential regulators of neuronal activity .
previous reports have shown that cdk5 inhibitors favor neurotransmitter release by increasing the activity of p / q - type channels .
in this regard , initial work by tomizawa and colleagues showed that cdk5 may phosphorylate the ii - iii loop in the pore - forming ( cav2.1alpha1 ) subunit , inhibiting the interaction of the channels with snare proteins such as snap - 25 and synaptotagmin [ 12 ] .
these results suggested that cdk5 plays a key role in neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminals of the adult brain .
more recently , su and colleagues showed that the n - type ( cav2.2 ) channel , the other major presynaptic ca2 + channel , is also a substrate of cdk5 .
phosphorylation of the pore - forming cav2.2alpha 1 subunit by cdk5 increased ca2 + influx and facilitated neurotransmitter release by enhancing channel open probability ( po ) .
these events seemed to be mediated by an interaction between cav2.2alpha1 and rim1 , which controls vesicle docking at the active zones .
these results outlined a mechanism by which cdk5 may regulate n - type channels and consequently might determine presynaptic function [ 37 ] .
likewise , these studies corroborated the pivotal role for cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation of cav channels in regulating presynaptic function , and highlighted the close interaction between kinases and these channels in neurons .
here , studying native t - type channels expressed in n1e - 115 cells , as well as recombinant channels transiently and stably expressed in hek - 293 cells , we show that cav3.1 channels , which play a crucial role in determining neuronal excitability , are also regulated by cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation .
the functional relevance of the cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation on cav3.1 channel activity was firstly assessed by whole - cell recordings in cdk5 transfected n1e - 115 cells .
remarkably , following coexpression of cdk5 peak current amplitude and current density were significantly increased compared to control ( gfp transfected ) cells .
likewise , in a cell line stably expressing cav3.1 , cdk5 transfection also increased current density , providing independent support for the notion that the increase in native neuronal t - type current density observed in n1e - 115 cells may be mediated by cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation .
in addition , we conducted whole - cell recordings in hek - 293 cells from transiently transfected with either the wild - type or a phosphorylation mutant of cav3.1 channels , in which a cdk5 phosphorylation site ( s2234a ) in the c - terminal region was abolished .
in these experiments , we found that the phosphorylation mutant expressed a current density profile similar to that of wild - type cav3.1 ; however , cells in the presence of cdk5 did not display an increase in current density .
distinct mechanisms may underlie the increase in cav3.1 current density following cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation .
previous studies have shown a role for diverse post - translational modifications in the regulation of t - type channels and enhanced ca2 + influx due to increased channel surface expression [ 38 ],[ 39 ],[ 40 ] .
indeed , this could be the most plausible explanation for our results , considering particularly that there were no significant differences in activation kinetics or voltage dependence of activation and inactivation between currents through cav3.1 channels in the presence or absence of cdk5 .
in this regard , the role of cdk5 in channel forward trafficking or in endocytosis is an interesting issue that remains unexplored .
in addition , it is worth mentioning that cdk5 - mediated phosphorylation increases po of cav2.2 ( n - type ) channels , and that this regulation is abolished in a mutant channel in which all cdk5 phosphorylation sites in the cav2.2alpha1 protein were eliminated [ 37 ] .
furthermore , it has been shown that protein kinase c ( pkc ) can modulate cav3 channels activity but pharmacological and fluorescence studies revealed that the surface density of cav3.1 t - type channels was not significantly changed by activation of pkc , suggesting that cav3.1 channel po might be affected by phosphorylation [ 41 ] .
it would be of great interest , therefore , to investigate whether phosphorylation of the cav3.1 channel by cdk5 also involves changes in channel po. the physiological relevance of phosphorylation of native t - type channels and their contribution to the function of the cells expressing these channels has not been totally understood .
it is well recognized that cav channels modulate the function of different neuronal types by influencing synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability .
while hva cav channels participate in fast synaptic transmission , t - type channels have a unique function in neuronal excitability [ 2 ] .
neuronal t - type channels have been shown to promote burst firing and low - amplitude intrinsic neuronal oscillations , as well as ca2 + entry and amplification of dendritic synaptic signals .
interestingly , evidence obtained in the last few years show that protein kinase activity may impact t - type channel function in different manners [ 42 ] .
in this scenario , cdk5 can profoundly affect cellular excitability by increasing the amplitude of the t - type currents .
last , as mentioned earlier , cdk5 is a serine / threonine kinase that is activated upon association with its activators p35 and p39 ( non - cyclin proteins ) .
it is predominantly neuronal , though cdk5 can be active also in several non - neuronal tissues .
cdk5 plays a pivotal role in the cns development , and cdk5 dysregulation has been implicated in different pathologies including alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease [ 43 ] .
interestingly , it has been reported that nerve - growth factor ( ngf ) induces strong , sustained expression of p35 through activation of the erk pathway [ 44 ] .
the induced kinase activity of cdk5 may be required for ngf - induced neurite outgrowth .
these results suggest the possibility of cdk5 activation directly via the ngf receptor expressed heterologously in conjunction with recombinant cav3.1 channels while performing electrophysiological recordings .
this is a very interesting topic for future experiments .
in summary , here we demonstrated a previously uncharacterized interaction between cav3.1 and the cdk5 / p35 complex that results in a cdk5 / p35 - mediated increase in cav3.1 current density , and identified a major phosphorylation site at serine 2234 within the c - terminus of the cav3.1alpha1 pore forming subunit ( fig. 7d ) .
these findings provide a framework to examine how cav3.1 channels are regulated in the context of cdk5 physiological activity .

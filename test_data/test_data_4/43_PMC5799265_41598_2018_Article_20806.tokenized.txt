riverine and atmospheric inputs are often considered as the main terrestrial sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ( din ) , phosphorus ( dip ) , and silicon ( dsi ) in the ocean .
however , the fluxes of nutrients via submarine groundwater discharge ( sgd ) often exceed riverine inputs in different local and regional scale settings .
in this study , we provide a first approximation of global nutrient fluxes to the ocean via total sgd , including pore water fluxes , by combining a global compilation of nutrient concentrations in groundwater and the sgd - derived 228ra fluxes .
in order to avoid overestimations in calculating sgd - derived nutrient fluxes , the endmember value of nutrients in global groundwater was chosen from saline groundwater samples ( salinity > 10 ) which showed relatively lower values over all regions .
the results show that the total sgd - derived fluxes of din , dip , and dsi could be approximately 1.4 - , 1.6 - , and 0.7 - fold of the river fluxes to the global ocean ( indo - pacific and atlantic oceans ) , respectively .
although significant portions of these sgd - derived nutrient fluxes are thought to be recycled within sediment - aquifer systems over various timescales , sgd - derived nutrient fluxes should be included in the global ocean budget in order to better understand dynamic interactions at the land - ocean interface .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction in the coastal ocean , nutrients could be supplied by advective inputs from aquifers and pore water , in addition to atmospheric and riverine inputs ( fig. 1 ) .
the advective fluxes may include nutrients from terrestrial sources and the remineralization of organic matter within the sediments ( fig. 1 ) .
in this study , we define submarine groundwater discharge ( sgd ) as any water advection into the ocean through the submarine ocean boundaries , which includes the discharge of fresh and saline groundwater as well as pore water advection1 - 3 .

nut. * denotes total nutrient inputs via sgd to coastal waters .
the total flux includes the nutrients in fresh and salty groundwater resulting from reactions with rocks , sediments , and organic matter , except the nutrients included in seawater recirculating .
in the coastal ocean , the diffusive fluxes of nutrients from bottom sediments in the euphotic zone are included in regenerated nutrients .
while global estimates are now available on the fluxes of nutrients to the global ocean via rivers and atmospheric deposition , no estimates are available for the sgd contribution to nutrient cycles in the global ocean .
the total sgd flux has been revealed to be comparable to the river discharge to the atlantic4 and global oceans5,6 using 228ra ( half life : 5.75 years ) as a tracer .
several local studies have suggested that saline groundwater often delivers larger fluxes of solutes to the ocean than fresh groundwater7 - 10. from a basin scale perspective , nutrient inputs through total sgd were found to be comparable to those via rivers in the mediterranean sea11 and yellow sea12 .
although saline groundwater is the dominant component of sgd globally1,7 , estimates only exist for the contributions of " fresh " groundwater to dissolved inorganic nitrogen ( din ) 13 and dissolved silicate ( dsi ) 14,15 fluxes .
here , we provide a first approximation of total sgd - derived nutrient fluxes to the global ocean using a simple mass balance approach .
the main challenge to assess this flux is to determine a globally - significant groundwater endmember concentration for estimating sgd - derived nutrient fluxes .
to do this , we combine a global compilation of nutrient data with the observationally constrained 228ra flux estimate through sgd5 and compare the estimated fluxes with the better quantified river sources .
results and discussion the global groundwater endmember data for din ( n = 966 ) , dissolved inorganic phosphorus ( dip , n = 1001 ) , dsi ( n = 784 ) , and 228ra ( n = 552 ) 6 for global coastal groundwater ( fig. 2 ) and seawater were compiled ( see supplementary note and fig. s1 ) .
approximately 800 sampling sites for groundwater nutrients ( nutrientgw ) clustered along the east coasts of asia and north america as well as the mediterranean sea , with scarce data elsewhere ( fig. 2 ) .
this clustering can affect the endmember concentrations of nutrients in groundwater .
therefore , a gridding method was used to examine the effect of the heterogeneity of geographical data distributions on determining the nutrient endmember values in groundwater .
this method divides the globe into the horizontal resolution of 2degrees x 2degrees grid points , as examined previously for 228ra6 .
all of the data within each grid point were averaged to represent the mean value at each grid point , assuming lognormal distributions of the tracer ( see for example figs 3 and 4 in kwon , et al.5 ) .
no discernible difference was observed between the gridded global mean endmember and a bulk average without gridding ( mean of the lognormal distribution ; supplementary note and fig. s2 ) .
thus , in this study , the global mean groundwater endmember obtained by the mean of the lognormal distribution without gridding was used for the calculation of sgd - derived nutrient fluxes .

figure 3 plots of the concentrations of ( a ) 228ra , ( b ) din , ( c ) dip , and ( d ) dsi versus the salinities of groundwater samples from world - wide coastal aquifers .
the arrows denote the endmember values .
the sampling sites for the compiled nutrientgw data cover a wide range of environments including beach porewater , seepage zone , and inland wells near marginal seas , corresponding to a wide range of salinity ( fig. 3 ) .
the concentrations of din and dsi are much higher in fresh groundwater ( salinity < 10 ) relative to saline groundwater ( supplementary fig. s3 ) .
the higher din concentrations in lower salinity groundwater ( supplementary fig. s3 ) may be associated with anthropogenic inputs , such as waste materials , fertilizers , manure , etc16,17 .
however , the higher concentrations of dsi in lower salinity groundwater ( supplementary fig. s3 ) are more likely due to natural processes such as rock weathering and the dissolution of biogenic silica in sediments18 .
in contrast , the activity of 228ra is much higher in saline groundwater ( salinity > 10 ; supplementary fig. s3 ) as explained by cho and kim6 .
the concentrations of dip are highest and relatively constant in groundwater with salinity between 10 and 30 ( supplementary fig. s3 ) .
the difference in dip concentrations for different salinity ranges is unclear because it is affected by various factors : ( 1 ) groundwater contamination with dip , ( 2 ) effects of dip adsorption - desorption equilibria at the ambient salinity , ( 3 ) dip remineralization by decomposing organic matter in coastal aquifers .
overall , the compiled data show that nutrient concentrations are remarkably constant at salinity values over 10 ( supplementary fig. s3 and table s1 ) .
in the subterranean estuary , mixing of recirculating seawater with fresh groundwater creates an active biogeochemical reaction zone19 .
thus , this zone significantly influences the fate of nutrients in the course of terrestrial nutrient transport from coastal aquifers to the ocean20 .
for example , redox conditions can affect the transformation processes and mobility of nitrogen ( n ) and phosphorus ( p ) in coastal aquifers21 .
although these transformation processes influence most of the sgd - derived nutrient flux estimations so far reported in sgd studies11,22 - 25 , the impact is still poorly understood .
further , biogeochemical conditions for the compiled nutrient samples are not well documented .
thus , instead of taking into account regional environmental conditions , we sort the nutrient samples according to the corresponding salinity values assuming that the groundwater salinity provides a first order criteria by which each nutrient sample can represent the globally averaged groundwater end member discharged into the marginal seas .
as a first - order estimate of the global sgd endmember , we excluded fresh groundwater ( salinity < 10 ) from the dataset ( fig. 4 ) under consideration , the approach taken by cho and kim6 .
for the chosen salinity range (> 10 ) , coastal aquifers may be less affected by biogeochemical transformation and anthropogenic contamination .
indeed , consistent values of our compiled data from global aquifers for this salinity range indicate that nutrients in this zone are mostly in equilibrium between sediments and pore water .
this choice is also supported by the fact that fresh groundwater is a minor fraction of sgd (< 10 %) 1,7 , although several local studies have shown that fresh groundwater can seep directly in the mixing zone especially in porous volcanic and oceanic island environments26 - 29 and also karstic environments30 .
figure 4 the histograms represent the distributions of ( a ) din , ( b ) dip , and ( c ) dsi in coastal groundwater of the global ocean .
the white and black bars represent salinity values lower and higher than 10 , respectively .

228ragw is obtained from cho and kim6 .
nutrientsw and 228rasw are the concentrations of nutrients and 228ra in the coastal seawater , obtained from garcia et al.31 ( supporting information text s1 and fig. s1 ) and kwon , et al.5 , respectively .
the recirculated seawater component of sgd - derived nutrient and 228ra fluxes are important , since we assume that the sgd fluxes are dominated by saline rather than fresh sgd1,7 .
228ra flux ( dpm yr - 1 ) is the flux of 228ra into the global ocean through sgd , which was estimated to be 1.3 +/ - 0.3 x 1017 dpm yr - 1 using a numerical model combined with a global compilation of 228ra observations5 .
global total nutrient fluxes our calculations show that total sgd - derived din , dip , and dsi fluxes into the global ocean of 2.3 +/ - 0.6 tmol yr - 1 , 0.06 +/ - 0.02 tmol yr - 1 , and 3.8 +/ - 1.0 tmol yr - 1 , respectively .
the uncertainty represents one standard error from the average .
these estimated sgd nutrient fluxes represent the total advective transport from continental margins to the coastal oceans through aquifers and pore waters .
a significant fraction of the dip and din in sgd may originate from the remineralization of organic matter within the sediments as observed in regional investigations32,33 .
therefore , only small fractions of the total estimated sgd - derived dip and din fluxes may be contributed by the net terrestrial fluxes to the ocean .
however , a large portion of the dsi in sgd is likely to be released from aquifer solids34 .
our first order estimates provide an opportunity to compare sgd and river nutrient inputs to the ocean on a global scale for the first time , building on previous regional and local investigations .
the estimated nutrient inputs through river discharge are from the global nutrient export from watersheds ( global news ) model , which includes river - basin - scale models that can predict export of dissolved and particulate nutrients using a function of natural and anthropogenic biogeophysical properties of 5761 exoreic basins35,36 .
the fluxes of riverine din , dip , and dsi are approximately 1.6 +/ - 0.2 tmol yr - 1 , 0.04 +/ - 0.006 tmol yr - 1 , and 5.1 +/ - 0.1 tmol yr - 1 , respectively35,36 .
therefore , total sgd - derived fluxes of din , dip , and dsi are approximately 1.4 - , 1.6 - , and 0.7 - fold of the riverine fluxes to the global ocean , respectively ( fig. 5 ) .
assuming that the nutrients supplied by total sgd are fully utilized by biological production , production supported by the total sgd - derived din flux ( 2.3 tmol yr - 1 ) could be potentially 15 tmol c yr - 1 .
these values are likely an underestimate of the actual fluxes since we use lower nutrient endmember ranges and higher ra endmember ranges ( data for salinity > 10 ) .
dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus would also increase the contribution of sgd to marine nutrient budgets33,37 .
figure 5 a comparison of global inputs of ( a ) din , ( b ) dip , and ( c ) dsi to the ocean via sgd and river discharge .
fluxes via riverine inputs were obtained from the literatures35,36 .
estimates of nutrient fluxes from fresh groundwater have been attempted in previous studies13 - 15 .
based on our compiled dataset , combining the globally averaged fresh sgd21,38 of 1.85 tm3 yr - 1 with the endmember value of din in fresh groundwater ( salinity = 0 ; 56 +/ - 23 mum ) , the resulting din flux from fresh component of sgd is 0.10 +/ - 0.04 tmol yr - 1 .
this value agrees with the n input to the global ocean estimated by a land - and process - based modeling study ( 0.1 tmol yr - 1 ) 13 .
using the same method , the dip ( salinity = 0 ; endmember value of dip = 0.6 +/ - 0.2 mum ) and dsi ( salinity = 0 ; endmember value of dsi = 131 +/ - 18 mum ) fluxes via fresh - sgd are estimated to be 0.0012 +/ - 0.0004 tmol yr - 1 and 0.24 +/ - 0.03 tmol yr - 1 , respectively .
the dip flux through fresh sgd is reported here for the first time .
the dsi flux estimated in this study is approximately 30 % of that reported by upscaling results14 from the two regional studies , which used an average groundwater dsi value of 340 mum from southern brazil39 and bengal basin40 .
however , our estimated global dsi endmember value in coastal groundwater ( salinity = 0 ) is approximately 130 mum , which is much lower than the value in the previous studies .
the general consistency with the previous estimates for the fresh - sgd provides confidence that our globally compiled nutrient dataset is reasonable even though it assumes no biogeochemical transformations within coastal aquifers .
our results suggest that saline groundwater plays a dominant role in the sgd - derived nutrient fluxes to the coastal ocean and that the sgd nutrients so far reported13 - 15 based on fresh groundwater discharge significantly underestimate the actual fluxes by total sgd .
as is the case for the recirculating saline groundwater , large fractions of the sgd - derived nutrient fluxes are thought to be recycled through food webs in costal marine ecosystems and sedimentation processes ( fig. 1 ) .
this recycling can occur on various timescales ranging from hours to geological timescales associated with tides and long - term changes in sea levels , and hence has important implications for the marine biogeochemical responses to environmental and climate changes .
the combined effects of riverine , atmospheric , and sgd - derived nutrient inputs are crucial for sustaining marine productivity in marginal seas and possibly in the open oceans .
a full understanding of the dynamic interactions among lands , marginal seas , and the open ocean and their responses to human activities can only be achieved by including sgd fluxes to local , regional , and global budgets .

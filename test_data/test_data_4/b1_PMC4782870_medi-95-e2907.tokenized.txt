http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract ocular decompression retinopathy ( odr ) , a rare postoperative complication following glaucoma surgery , is characterized by the transient appearance of scattered retinal hemorrhages .
here , we present a unique case of odr in a patient with primary open angle glaucoma who underwent canaloplasty .
a 31 - year - old male patient presented with an intraocular pressure ( iop ) of 60 mm hg in the right eye .
the iop remained over 40 mm hg , even when treated with maximum tolerated antiglaucoma medication .
canaloplasty drastically lowered iop in the right eye from 40 to 7 mm hg. however , fundus examination revealed odr after surgery .
the patient was treated with tobramycin and dexamethasone .
three months after canaloplasty , iop remained in control at 16 mm hg and all retinal hemorrhages had completely resolved .
this case demonstrates that odr can occur following canaloplasty and physicians should be aware of this potential complication in patients with severely elevated iop .
sufficiently lowering iop before surgery and gradually decreasing iop during surgery may prevent odr from occurring .
open - accesstrue introduction fechtner et al1 first reported the presence of retinal hemorrhages following trabeculectomy under the descriptive term of ocular decompression retinopathy ( odr ) .
this condition is defined as a multifocal hemorrhagic retinopathy that occurs following acute lowering of intraocular pressure ( iop ) that is not explained by another pathological process.2 hemorrhages occur throughout the fundus and often have white centers .
visual acuity is generally unaffected.1 although the pathological mechanism of odr is not agreed upon , elevated iop subsequent rapid iop reduction seems to be associated with the condition .
in addition to trabeculectomy , odr has been observed following ahmed valve implantation , peripheral iridotomy , anterior chamber paracentesis , deep sclerotomy , express shunt implantation , and iop - lowering medication use.3 - 8 canaloplasty is a new bleb - independent glaucoma surgery that is an established treatment for poag. by canulating , viscodilating , and stenting schlemm canal ( sc ) , aqueous humor outflow via the physiological collector system is facilitated.9 to the best of our knowledge , odr following canaloplasty has not been previously reported in the literature .
consent this study adhered to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki .
informed consent was signed by the patient for publication of this report and its related images .
case presentation a 31 - year - old male patient presented with pain and decreased vision in the right eye that had begun 1 year earlier .
because all symptoms resolved with rest , so the patient did not seek medical attention .
one month before presenting to our clinic , symptoms had dramatically worsened and were occasionally accompanied by nausea and vomiting .
a review of the patient 's medical history revealed that he had been diagnosed with a retinal detachment in the left eye at another eye clinic 2 years earlier .
the patient chose not to undergo surgical repair of the retinal detachment because he was afraid to undergo surgery. between that time and the first visit to our clinic , vision in the left eye had painlessly decreased to no light perception ( nlp ) .
the patient did not use antiglaucoma or anti - inflammatory medications and had no history of systemic disease .
at the time of presentation , best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) was 20 / 200 ( refractive correction of - 4.75d ) in the right eye and nlp in the left eye .
the iop was 60 mm hg in the right eye and 9 mm hg in the left eye .
ocular examination revealed mild corneal edema , clear lens , and a normal deep anterior chamber with a wide angle in the right eye and a normal anterior chamber and clear lens in the left eye .
fundus examination showed a vertical optic disc cup - to - disc ratio of 0.9 in the right eye and a long - standing retinal detachment associated with proliferative retinopathy in the left eye .
humphrey visual field testing ( 30 - 2 ) showed predominantly temporal inferior and superior visual field defects in the right eye .
a diagnosis of poag was given to the right eye based on clinical signs and symptoms .
the patient was admitted to the hospital and topical ( travoprost , once a day ; timolo , twice a day ; brinzolamide , twice a day ) , oral ( vinegaramin , 25 mg , 3 times a day ) , and intravenous ( mannitol 20 % , twice a day ) antiglaucoma agents were administered .
unfortunately , iop in the right eye remained above 40 mm hg despite administration of the maximum amount of medical therapy .
therefore , canaloplasty was performed on the right eye in a routine manner .
after applying topical anesthesia , an incision was made in the conjunctiva and tenon capsule and a 4 mm x 5 mm superficial scleral flap was created at the limbus at 12 o'clock .
a deep flap was then created within the superficial flap margin .
a temporal paracentesis was performed before sc was unroofed and a trabeculo - descemet 's window was formed .
a flexible microcatheter ( itrack 250a ; iscience interventional , menlopark , ca ) was used to dilate the full circumference of the canal by injecting sodium hyaluronate 1.4 % ( healon gv ) during catheterization .
following complete circumferential dilation of sc , a 10 - 0 polypropylene tensioning suture was placed .
the deep flap was excised and the superficial flap and conjunctiva were closed in a watertight manner .
high - resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy ( ubm ) was used to assess sc and anterior segment angle morphology ( figure 1 ) .

b , postoperative ubm image of the anterior chamber at the 3 o'clock position .
an enlarged schlemm canal and a prolene suture within the canal ( arrow ) are easily seen .
one day after surgery , bcva in the right eye was 20 / 100 , the cornea was clear , and iop was 7 mm hg. fundus examination revealed scattered white - centered retinal hemorrhages in the periphery and posterior pole ( figure 2 ) .
a mild choroidal detachment was detected in the right eye using ubm .
therefore , the patient was administered tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension every 2 hours .
one week after surgery , the choroidal detachment had completely resolved , iop had improved to 18 mm hg , and retinal hemorrhages began to resolve .
three months after surgery , the bcva in the right eye was 20 / 80 and iop remained in control at 16 mm hg with topical latanoprost 0.005 % ( 1 drop per day , pfizer inc , new york , ny ) .
fundus examination showed complete resolution of all retinal hemorrhages .

multiple , diffuse , white - centered retinal hemorrhages are apparent .
discussion ocular decompression retinopathy is an uncommon complication associated with surgical and medical procedures performed to treat glaucoma.3 - 8 the diffuse , multilevel hemorrhages seen in the fundus can mimic a central retinal vein occlusion .
however , odr does not present with venous dilation and delayed venous filling on fluorescein angiography.10,11 the differential diagnosis of odr and other vascular disorders , including valsalva retinopathy , terson syndrome , and diabetic retinopathy , should be considered .
the pathogenesis of odr is not fully understood , but several risk factors have been suggested .
mandal et al12 theorized that the valsalva maneuver performed during general anesthesia , which is known to increase retinal blood flow , might play a role in the development of odr .
however , in our case , surgery was performed under topical anesthesia .
additionally , our case is similar to 1 case reported by kozobolis et al,6 which involved a case of odr following deep sclerotomy performed under topical anesthesia .
together these cases suggest that general anesthesia is not a predisposing factor to the development of odr .
elevated iop and the subsequent rapid iop reduction seem to be associated with the development of odr .
jung et al13 found that only preoperative iop influenced the occurrence of odr .
this finding suggests that high preoperative iop largely affect retinal capillaries via pressure - induced trauma .
when iop is reduced following surgery , arterial inflow increases , which can compromise retinal capillaries.8 it is possible that a loss of retinal vessel autoregulation occurs for glaucoma patients .
if this is the case , retinal capillaries would fill beyond their limits when iop is acutely reduced , resulting in retinal haemorrhages.1,8 gupta et al14 postulated that sudden hypotony results in a scleral deformity and the subsequent shearing of fragile capillaries .
it also may be that an acute decrease in iop distorts the lamina cribrosa and subsequently compresses the central retinal vein.10,15 unfortunately , none of these mechanisms , all of which involve mechanical and vascular etiologies , have been fully elucidated .
canaloplasty is a relatively new , nonpenetrating procedure performed to treat poag .
this procedure aims to increase physiological aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber through a trabeculo - descemet 's window into schlemm canal.16 grieshaber et al9 reported a sustained , long - term benefit of canaloplasty in black african patients with poag .
this led them to recommend canaloplasty for patients with enhanced wound healing and scar formation and led us to choose canaloplasty for this young 31 - year - old patient .
in contrast to traditional trabeculectomy , canaloplasty does not require subconjunctival bleb formation or the use of antimetabolites .
the most frequent intraoperative complication was the creation of a false - passage creation ( 3.3 %) , and postoperative complication was mild hyphema ( 45.5 %) , respectively.9,17 some authors have suggested that average iop following canaloplasty is not low enough .
therefore , canaloplasty should be considered for patients with mild - to - moderate glaucoma.18,19 in the case presented here , there was no evidence during surgery of an obstruction or false - passage creation .
in our case , canaloplasty sufficiently lowered iop in a patient with high iop (> 40 mm hg ) that was not controllable with medication .
immediately following surgery , iop was very low ( 7 mm hg ) , which partially resulted from a postoperative choroidal detachment .
in our case , both preoperative iop ( 60 mm hg at its peak ) and the acute iop change that occurred in 1 day played a role in the development of odr .
therefore , it is of great importance for physicians to be aware of odr in patients with severely elevated iop who planned to undergo canaloplasty .
in conclusion , the current case demonstrates that odr can occur following canaloplasty .
in order to minimize the risk of this rare complication , iop should be decreased as much as possible before surgery and gradually lowered during surgery in eyes with severely elevated preoperative iop .

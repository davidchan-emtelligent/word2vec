objective recent recommendations regarding indications of accelerated partial breast irradiation ( apbi ) have been put forward for selected breast cancer ( bc ) patients .
however , some treatment planning parameters , such as total dose , are not yet well defined .
the institut gustave roussy has initiated a dose escalation trial at the 40 gy / 10 fractions / 5 days and at a further step of total dose ( td ) of 42 gy / 10 fractions / 5 days .
here , we report early results of the latest step compared with the 40 gy dose level .
methods and materials from october 2007 to march 2010 , a total of 48 pt1n0 bc patients were enrolled within this clinical trial : 17 patients at a td of 42 gy / 10f / 5d and 31 at a td of 40 gy / 10f / 5d .
median follow - up was 19 months ( min - max , 12 - 26 ) .
all the patients were treated by apbi using a technique with 2 minitangents and an " enface " electrons delivering 20 % of the total dose .
toxicities were systematically assessed at 1 ; 2 ; 6 months and then every 6 months .
results patients' recruitment of 42 gy step was ended owing to persistent grade 3 toxicity 6 months after apbi completion ( n = 1 ) .
early toxicities were statistically higher after a total dose of 42 gy regarding grade >= 2 dry ( p = 0.01 ) and moist ( p = 0.05 ) skin desquamation .
breast pain was also statistically higher in the 42 gy step compared to 40 gy step ( p = 0.02 ) .
other late toxicities ( grade >= 2 fibrosis and telangectasia ) were not statistically different between 42 gy and 40 gy. conclusions early toxicities were more severe and higher rates of late toxicities were observed after 42 gy / 10 fractions / 5 days when compared to 40 gy / 10 fractions / 5 days .
this data suggest that 40 gy / 10 fractions / 5 days could potentially be the maximum tolerance for pbi although longer follow - up is warranted to better assess late toxicities .
3d - conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation dose escalation introduction the current trend in early breast cancer ( bc ) is to shorten overall treatment time either by hypofractionated whole breast irradiation [ 1 ] or by accelerated partial breast irradiation ( apbi ) .
local control efficacy of 3d - conformal apbi compared to whole breast irradiation is currently investigated through large clinical trials , such as nsabp b - 39 / rtog - 0413 phase iii trial [ 2 ] and rapid trial [ 3 ] .
waiting for definitive results of those clinical trials , the american and european radiation oncology societies ( astro and estro ) put forward guidelines for selected group of patients with breast cancer at low risk of local relapse for whom apbi could be performed out of clinical trials [ 4,5 ] .
even though 3d - conformal apbi is one of the most used apbi technique due to its practicality [ 6 ] , the optimal total dose and fractionation is not yet well defined .
a dose escalation 3d - conformal apbi trial has been initiated in 2003 at the massachussetts general hospital ( mgh ) to assess the optimal total dose consisting in delivering 32 gy / 8fractions ( f ) over 4 days ; 36 gy / 9f over 4 ( 1 / 2 ) days ; 40 gy / 10f over 5 days (" 40 gy step ") .
in collaboration with the mgh , we extended this clinical trial by the enrolment of patients in the 40 gy step [ 7 ] and in an additional and further step : 42 gy in 10 bid fractions over 5 days .
we have recently reported the 40 gy step (( 7 )) and here , we report early results of the latest step comparing 42 gy / 10 f with the 40 gy / 10 f dose level .
methods and materials study population from october 2007 to march 2010 , 48 pt1n0 unifocal bc patients were prospectively enrolled in an institutional and national review board - approved phase ii trial .
patients eligibility has been already described in [ 7 ] and they were treated 4 to 12 weeks after a breast conservative surgery with 3d - conformal apbi .
stopping rules were any persistent and severe ( grade 3 ) toxicities ( fibrosis or fat necrosis ) or persistent early grade 3 toxicity occurring during the year that followed apbi completion .
31 breast cancer patients were enrolled in the 40 gy step ; and only 17 breast cancer patients in the 42 gy step .
hence , per the trial stopping rules , patients' recruitment was ended owing to persistent grade 3 toxicity 6 months after apbi completion ( n = 1 ) .
treatment planning and toxicity assessment briefly , all patients underwent to computed tomography ( ct ) - based 3d planning .
the ipsilateral and contralateral breast , left and right lungs and heart were contoured [ 8 ] .
the clinical target volume ( ctv ) was defined as the delineation of the visible lumpectomy cavity and the surgical clips placed inside the lumpectomy cavity [ 9 - 11 ] ; planning target volume ( ptv ) as a ctv expansion of 2.3 to 2.8 cm. the ptv for evaluation ( ptv _ eval ) was the ptv with exclusion of the anterior chest wall / pectoralis muscles and the first 5 mm of tissue under the skin and anterior chest wall / pectoralis muscles ( according to the definition by vicini et al. [ 12 ]) .
the technique used was a combination of photon beams of 6 mv and electrons of 6 to 22 mev .
the dosimetric plan was performed using dosigray 4.1.2.50 tps ( dosisoft ) [ 11 ] .
normal tissue dose - volume constraints were defined as followed : 50 % of the non - targeted breast volume had be less than 50 % of the prescribed dose ; the ptv _ eval - to - whole breast ratio had to be less than 25 % ; and a limited dose was to be received by heart and lungs .
the lung volume dose constraints used were as follows : < 3 % at 20 gy , < 10 % at 10 gy , and < 20 % at 5 gy [ 13 ] .
two successive total doses were prospectively assessed : 40 gy in 10 bid fractions over 5 days and 42 gy in 10 bid fractions over 5 days , with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours .
statistical methods patients and tumors characteristics were compared with the wilcoxon test between each steps ( 40 gy and 42 gy ) .
dosimetric data of 40 gy and 42gy steps were compared with the wilcoxon test .
initial toxicities assessment was performed before apbi ; then 1 , 2 , 6 months after apbi completion and further every 6 months .
toxicities were scored according to the rtog scale : grade 0 for none ; grade 1 for mild ; grade 2 for moderate ; grade 3 for severe ; and grade 4 for fatal toxicities .
toxicities incidences ( by type and global ) , estimated for each of the 2 total doses , were plotted with kaplan meier incidence curves and compared with a log - rank test .
results patients and tumor characteristics are listed in table 1 .
median follow - up was 19 months ( min - max , 12 - 26 ) in the 42 gy step vs 32 months ( min - max , 23 - 40 ) in the 40 gy step .
mean age was 67 years ( min - max , 52 - 76 ) .
median tumor size was 10 mm ( min - max , 4 - 20 ) .
enrolled patients had mainly pt1n0 invasive ductal carcinoma ( 82 %) , positive hormone receptors , negative her2 overexpression .

on the contrary , patients who were enrolled in the 42 gy step had statistically more grade 2 moist desquamation ( p = 0.05 ) ; and had statistically more grade 2 dry desquamation ( p = 0.01 ) at early time points ( 1 and 2 months after apbi completion ) .
late toxicities increased with higher total dose and occurred earlier ( at 6 months ) .
grade >= 2 telangiectasia were observed at 6 months in 2 / 17 ( 12 %) of patients in the 42 gy versus 1 / 31 ( 3.2 %) for the 40 gy and increased with time ( 30 % in the 42 gy versus 6 % for the 40 gy at 18 months ) .
grade >= 2 breast fibrosis was observed in 2 / 31 ( 6.5 %) of 40 gy - patients and in 4 / 17 ( 24 %) of 42 gy - patients at 6 months .
similarly , grade >= 2 breast fibrosis was reported at 18 months in 3 / 31 ( 10 %) of 40 gy - patients and in 3 / 17 ( 18 %) of 42 gy - patients .
hence , cosmetic results assessed by physicians were considered as fair in 3 / 13 patients at 18 months in the 42 gy step whereas in the 40 gy step was 2 / 26 patients .
however grade >= 2 toxicities between 40 gy and 42 gy steps were not statistically different except for breast pain ( p = 0.02 ) .
patients treated at the 42 gy step indeed observed more grade >= 2 breast pain ( 3 / 17 patients ) rather than those treated at the 40 gy step ( 4 / 31 patients ) , the difference was statistically significant ( p = 0.02 ) .
discussion a higher total dose of 42 gy delivered by 3d - conformal apbi showed adequate treatment planning and did not increase organs at risk exposure when compared to other 3d - conformal apbi using lesser total dose [ 7 ] .
early tolerance was less suitable after a total dose of 42 gy with higher risk of dry or moist skin desquamation .
in addition , even though patients' enrollment was ended owing to persistent grade 3 toxicity 6 months after apbi completion , all late grade >= 2 toxicities were not statistically different between 40 and 42 gy steps except for breast pain .
many apbi clinical trials are currently in progress using 3d - conformal radiotherapy and using different total doses and fractionations .
a dose escalation phase ii trial has been initiated at igr in 2007 to assess the maximal dose tolerance .
biologic effects in terms of tumor control and normal tissue reactions are estimated through biologically effective dose ( bed ) values .
the bed values for apbi schedules should be interpreted by taking into account that the linear quadratic model is not enough adequate to accurately assess accelerated and bifractionated irradiation schedule .
hence , a total dose of 42 gy in 10 fractions over 5 days achieved a bed value at 68.5 gy for acute effects as erythema ( alpha / beta ratio equal to 8 ) .
in the present study , the 42 gy step conferred higher risk of acute skin toxicities with 64 % of grade 1 - 2 erythema and 23 % of grade 1 - 2 dry desquamation .
others non invasive apbi studies reported lower rate of acute radio - induced effects as the authors used irradiation scheme with lower bed .
for instance , livi and colleagues described 5 % of grade 1 and 0.8 % grade 2 acute skin toxicities after imrt - apbi delivering a total dose of 30 gy in 5 fractions over one week ( bed value at 44.2 gy for acute effects ) [ 14 ] .
other study reported similar results to those form livi and colleagues , with 6 % of grade 2 acute skin toxicities occurred after a total dose of 38 gy in 10 bid fraction over 5 days ( bed value of 58.8 gy ) [ 15 ] .
similarly , vicini and colleagues observed 43 % of mild erythema and 12 % of mild dry desquamation after 3d - conformal apbi ( total dose of 38.5 gy / 10f / 5d , i.e. bed value of 59.8 gy ) .
when bed values were estimated for late toxicities , low alpha / beta ratio is usually used ( alpha / beta ratio = 2 ) .
even though a longer median fu of this study is warranted to accurately assess the role of 42 gy in 10 fractions in the development of late toxicities , grade 1 - 2 breast pain was observed in 70 % of patients and all grade 3 late toxicities in 11.8 % of patients ( fibrosis , telangiectasia , severe breast pain ; n = 3 ) for an estimated bed value at 132 gy. in recent report of vicini and colleagues [ 16,4 ] ; the authors described 30.8 % of grade 1 - 2 breast pain and 4 % of grade 3 late toxicities for a bed value estimated at 112.6 gy. most of apbi clinical trials or prospective studies used an external beam irradiation ( 3d - conformal or intensity - modulated radiotherapy ) with a total dose of 38.5 gy and attempted to determine dosimetric factors predicting late toxicity occurrence .
despite treatment planning and delivery were conform to the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project b - 39 / radiation therapy oncology group 0413 protocol ( nsabp - b39 / rtog 0413 ) , none risk factor was retrieved .
hence hepel and colleagues have initially described the maximum dose within the breast , ptv _ eval and the breast volume exposure in proportion to the overall nontarget breast volume ( v5 - 80 ) as risk factors of late toxicities occurrence ( median follow - up of 15 months ) [ 17 ] .
at the opposite , recent initial results of rtog 0319 did not get any risk factors of late toxicities after a longer median follow - up ( 36 months ) [ 18 ] .
here , using a single institution experience and using the same 3d - conformal apbi technique , we showed through a prospective clinical trial that increasing total dose to a 42 gy / 10 fractions , bid could be a risk factor of early toxicities such as grade >= 2 dry and moist skin desquamation and of breast pain .
conclusions optimal total dose and fractionation are still debated even though most of apbi protocols use treatment planning and delivery in accordance to the nsabp - b39 / rtog 0413 protocol .
the total dose of 42 gy in 10 fractions over 10 days is probably not optimal and can cause significant acute toxicity .
optimal total dose for efficacy and for tolerance would be determined through a larger cohort within a dose escalation phase ii trial with mature data [ 19 ] and a longer follow - up is warranted to prospectively assess long - term toxicity .

however , the es cell technique is inefficient and time - consuming .
recently , two new gene - targeting technologies have been developed : the transcription activator - like effector nuclease ( talen ) system , and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat ( crispr )/ crispr - associated protein ( cas ) system .
in addition to aiding researchers in solving conventional problems , these technologies can be used to induce site - specific mutations in various species for which es cells have not been established .
here , by targeting the fgf10 gene through rna microinjection in one - cell mouse embryos with the talen and crispr / cas systems , we produced the known limb - defect phenotypes of fgf10 - deficient embryos at the f0 generation .
compared to the talen system , the crispr / cas system induced the limb - defect phenotypes with a strikingly higher efficiency .
our results demonstrate that although both gene - targeting technologies are useful , the crispr / cas system more effectively elicits single - step biallelic mutations in mice .
methodologies for disrupting the genome can be used to further our understanding of biological mechanisms .
forward genetic approaches , such as invoking the mismatch repair system with alkylating agents ( e.g. ethylmethanesulfonate and ethylnitrosourea ) and inducing mutagenesis by ultraviolet trimethylpsoralen or chromosomal transposon insertion , are mainly used to analyse the precise function of genes .
reverse genetic analyses of mice and rats have become possible through the development of embryonic stem ( es ) cells .
however , although well - developed and extensively used , gene - targeting technology using es cells is costly and time - consuming1 .
therefore , researchers are seeking to apply new genome - editing tools to mice as the next generation of genome - modification technologies .
recently , several powerful techniques , including zinc finger nucleases ( zfns ) , transcription activator - like ( tal ) effector nucleases ( talens ) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat ( crispr )/ crispr - associated protein ( cas ) system , have been developed and used to edit the genomes of cultured cells and various organisms234 .
talens consist of an engineered array of tal effector repeats fused to the foki cleavage domain. by binding to specific sequences on opposing dna strands , talens introduce double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) into the target gene5 .
in mammalian zygotes , talen - mediated gene targeting was first performed in rats6 via rna microinjection into one - cell embryos and , later , in mice789 .
crispr / cas is an rna - based adaptive immune system developed by bacteria and archaea to cleave foreign nucleic acids ( e.g. viral genomes and plasmids ) 10 .
the complex of a crispr rna ( crrna ) and a trans - activating crrna ( tracrrna ) was shown to guide the cas9 endonuclease to a specific dna target sequence to generate dsbs11 .
an engineered single guide rna ( sgrna ) , consisting of crrna fused with tracrrna , also directed sequence - specific cas9 - mediated cleavage10 .
crispr / cas has been applied to cultured human cells1213 , flies , zebrafish , mice and rats for genome - editing purposes14151617 .
gene targeting with crispr / cas in one - cell mouse and rat embryos allowed the highly efficient production of heritable single or multiple gene mutations at the f0 generation1617 .
previous studies have demonstrated greater efficiency of gene targeting with crispr / cas compared to the talen system in zebrafish and mice67161718 .
however , to our knowledge , no study has described the differences in effects on the same target sequence or gene between these two genome - modifying systems .
here , we report the highly efficient disruption of the fgf10 gene in mice via the talen and crispr / cas systems .
results mutagenesis of an endogenous gene using talens fgf10 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family .
it plays an essential role in mesenchymal - epithelial interactions for the proper development of many organs .
fgf10 - deficient mice show an obvious phenotype of complete limb deficiency19 .
thus , the effects of dsbs in fgf10 can be directly observed via this easily identifiable morphological phenotype .
accordingly , we chose mouse fgf10 as the target gene for our study .
the fgf10 gene consists of three exons .
transposagen biopharmaceuticals , inc .
designed a talen pair with a 19 - bp spacer in exon 1 ( fig. 1a ) .
talen mrnas produced by in vitro transcription were microinjected at different concentrations ( 10 , 20 or 50 ng / mul ) into the cytoplasm or pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs .
after an overnight in vitro culture of the injected oocytes , two - cell embryos were transferred into pseudo - pregnant female mice .
the resulting embryos or pups were assayed for alteration of the talen - targeted fgf10 locus by direct sequencing and the surveyor ( cel - i ) endonuclease assay ( fig. 1b ) .
as shown in table 1 , when talen mrnas at 50 , 20 and 10 ng / mul were injected into the cytoplasm , 48 % ( 13 / 27 ) , 26 % ( 11 / 43 ) and 27 % ( 16 / 59 ) of embryos , respectively , exhibited non - homologous end joining ( nhej ) .
when mrnas at 20 and 10 ng / mul were injected into pronuclei , the fgf10 gene was modified in 13 % ( 1 / 8 ) and 21 % ( 4 / 19 ) of embryos , respectively .
when talen mrnas at 50 ng / mul were injected into the cytoplasm , 47 % ( 15 / 32 ) of pups showed fgf10 gene modification .
two f0 embryos with limb defects were obtained by microinjection of talen mrnas ( fig. 1c , d ) .
sequence analysis was performed of these two embryos and the founder lines ( fig. 2a , b ) .
the embryo talen _ ld - # 1 possessed limb defects and biallelic null mutations ( - 2 / - 7 ) .
talen _ ld - # 2 exhibited non - uniform right forelimb development and carried mosaic alleles (+ 1 / - 1 + 1 / - 1 ) .
some mosaic founders (# 1 , 3 , 11 ) were occasionally observed ( fig. 2 ) .
flanking of the dsbs by short sequence repeats was previously reported in both talen - and crispr / cas - induced mutations in mice and rats .
this same effect was likely responsible for the preferential generation of the observed alleles61620 .
in talen - induced mutations , several alleles ( e.g. + 1 of c , - 1 , - 3 of two places , - 7 , - 9 ) were repeatedly recovered in independently derived mice .
several alleles ( e.g. - 5 , - 7 , - 8 , - 9 , - 16 , - 24 ) were considered to be formed by microhomology - mediated end joining ( mmej ) 2122 .
germline transmission and generation of homozygous knockout mice we bred several f0 mice or their offspring with wild - type or mutant mice to confirm the germline transmission of each allele found in mosaic animals and the disruption of gene function .
we assayed the resulting embryos for each allele present in their parents by sequence analysis .
all of the examined talen - modified alleles were confirmed to be transmitted through the germline .
however , a homozygous mutant with - 9 / - 30 + 2 alleles ( offspring of wt /+ 1 / - 9 [ m1 ] x wt / - 30 + 2 [ f11 ]) did not show any limb - defect phenotype ( table 2 ) .
expected embryos presenting limb - defect phenotypes were obtained for the offspring of wt / - 5 x wt / - 1 and wt / - 1 x wt / - 1 .
gene knockout using crispr / cas next , we selected the same region to the talen target site ( crispr _ 143 ) for gene knockout with the crispr / cas system ( fig. 3a ) .
cas9 mrnas and sgrna produced by in vitro transcription were microinjected into the cytoplasm of fertilized mouse eggs .
after the injected oocytes were cultured overnight in vitro , two - cell embryos were transferred into pseudo - pregnant female mice .
embryos were isolated between embryonic day 14.5 ( e14.5 ) and e17.0. of the 25 embryos injected with crispr _ 143 , 14 embryos ( 56 %) at f0 showed limb defects ( table 3 ) .
some embryos had various limb - defect phenotypes ( fig. 3b ) .
the embryos were assayed for alteration of the crispr - targeted fgf10 loci by direct sequencing and cel - i endonuclease .
nhej events were detected in 24 embryos ( 96 % , table 3 ). fig. 4 reports the dna sequences of the obtained embryos , some of which showed mosaic phenotypes ( figs. 3b , 4 ) , including 143 - # 3 ( wt /+ 2 / - 2 / - 4 ) , # 18 (+ 2 / - 1 / - 3 + 3 / - 19 ) , # 20 ( wt / - 2 / - 4 / - 52 ) and # 21 ( wt / - 1 / - 4 / - 10 / - 14 ) .
embryos 143 - # 4 - # 8 , # 13 , # 14 and # 22 - # 25 were visually normal ; however , wild - type alleles were not detected for embryos 143 - # 4 ( - 1 / - 6 ) , # 13 ( - 1 / - 18 / - 24 ) or # 23 ( - 3 / - 7 ) ( fig. 4 ) .
embryo 143 - # 16 , in which all 32 clones were 14 - nucleotide deletions , exhibited the complete limb - deficiency phenotype ( figs. 3b , 4 ) .
several alleles ( e.g. - 1 , - 2 , - 4 , - 10 , - 14 ) were commonly recovered .
six alleles ( e.g. - 10 , - 14 , - 18 , - 24 , - 27 , - 52 ) were considered to be formed by mmej .
previous studies identified causative mutations of aplasia of the lacrimal and salivary glands ( alsg ) and lacrimo - auriculo - dento - digital ( ladd ) syndrome , which are overlapping clinical entities , in the fgf10 gene232425 .
these mutations included a missense mutation in exon 3 , nonsense mutations in exons 2 and 3 , and a substitution of the terminal nucleotide of intron 2 , leading to loss of the splice acceptor site of exon 3 , affecting the c - terminal region .
next , we sought to verify the importance of exon 3 for protein function .
we designed the crispr _ 547 and crispr _ 563 constructs in exon3 of the fgf10 gene ( fig. 3a ) .
cas9 mrnas and sgrna were microinjected and egg transfer was performed as described for crispr _ 143 .
when the crispr _ 547 and crispr _ 563 constructs were used , 94 % ( 17 / 18 ) and 58 % ( 18 / 31 ) of the f0 - generation embryos , respectively , had altered limb development ( table 3 ) .
some embryos exhibited various limb - defect phenotypes ( fig. s1 ) .
for the crispr _ 547 construct with 10 ng / mul cas9 mrna and 1 or 0.1 ng / mul sgrnas , 100 % ( 4 / 4 ) or 93 % ( 13 / 14 ) of embryos , respectively , showed limb - defect phenotypes , compared to 91 % ( 10 / 11 ) or 40 % ( 8 / 20 ) , respectively , for the crispr _ 563 construct ( table 3 ) .
when the crispr _ 547 construct was used , the complete limb - deficiency phenotype was observed in embryos 547 - # 5 - # 12 and # 14 .
embryos 547 - # 5 - # 11 and # 14 possessed biallelic or mosaic mutations without wild - type alleles .
in embryos 547 - # 8 and # 10 , half or all of the detected alleles were in - frame indels , which are evenly divisible by three ( figs. 5 and s1 ) .
embryo 547 - # 12 had eyelids , which should be lost in fgf10 - / - mice ( figs. 5 and s1 ) , and only 2 / 35 clones had the wild - type allele .
some alleles ( e.g. + 2 , - 1 ) were occasionally recovered .
several alleles ( e.g. - 6 , - 10 , - 14 , - 15 , - 53 ) were considered to be formed by mmej .
for crispr _ 563 , embryos 563 - # 12 - # 15 visually exhibited the complete limb - deficiency phenotype .
these embryos possessed mosaic mutations without wild - type alleles or in - frame indels .
embryos 563 - # 16 , # 17 and # 19 , which possessed wild - type alleles , exhibited non - uniform limb - defect phenotypes ( fig. 5 , s1 ) .
some alleles ( e.g. + 1 , - 1 , - 7 , - 8 , - 13 ) were occasionally recovered .
several alleles ( e.g. - 7 , - 8 , - 13 , - 14 , - 15 , - 16 ) were considered to be formed by mmej .
discussion the talen and crispr / cas systems have recently become more popular for genome editing than zfns , probably because of the flexibility and easy preparation of the former constructs .
zfn - induced mutations have an efficiency of up to ~ 7.4 % ( 20 - 75 % of live births ) 262728 .
widely different mutagenic efficiencies have been reported for talens , probably due to the numerous methods of constructing talens harbouring different tal effector scaffolds and repeat variants .
talen efficiencies of up to 15 % have been reported for some targets , including fragile - site genes ( e.g. with at - rich and dinucleotide - repeat regions ) 29 , the repeat - rich y chromosome30 , and microrna genes31 .
efficiencies of 40 - 100 % were reported for talen - induced mutagenesis323334 .
high efficiencies have been reported for targeted gene disruption with crispr / cas ( e.g. > 75 % of founders with mutations17 and a biallelic mutation induction efficiency of <= 50 % 16 ) .
although the talen and crispr / cas systems have been used to disrupt the genome in mice781617 , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report to show disruption of the same gene by both methods .
fgf10 was selected as the marker gene because of its obvious limb - deficiency phenotype in the knockout embryo19 .
previous studies compared the efficiencies of indel mutagenesis by talen and crispr / cas in mammalian cells and zebrafish .
although crispr / cas elicited a higher mutagenic activity ( up to ~ 29 %) than talen ( up to ~ 4.5 %) in mammalian cells12 , talen showed superior performance in zebrafish ( cas9 / grna : ~ 3 - 70 % , talen : ~ 5 - 100 %) 18 .
in the present study , when the talen system was used , the efficiency of nhej mutations was as high as ~ 50 % , and the frequency of f0 embryos with limb defects was as high as ~ 10 % .
we , then , evaluated the capacity of crispr / cas system to disrupt genes in mice , by selecting the same region to the talen target site ( crispr _ 143 ) .
the efficiency of talen - induced nhej events ranged 27 - 48 % , whereas the crispr _ 143 - induced mutation rate exceeded 90 % .
dsbs are efficiently repaired by mmej and homologous recombination .
mmej is a ku - independent end - joining method mediated by base pairing between microhomologous sequences of 5 - 25 nucleotides21 .
in this study , although both talen and cirspr / cas induced many types of indels in the same region , they did not produce the same indels .
because the pam sequence recognized by cas9 nuclease is slightly separated from the talen spacer region , the short sequence repeats used for dsb repair might be different between them .
for the limb phenotypes , embryos injected with sgrna ( crispr _ 143 ) and cas9 mrna showed higher frequencies of limb - defect phenotypes ( up to ~ 60 %) compared to embryos injected with talen mrnas ( up to ~ 10 %) at the f0 generation .
moreover , the crispr / cas system may remain active until later in embryogenesis than the talen system from the variety of mutant alleles detected in each mosaic animal .
mutant alleles induced by either system reportedly transmit to the next generation at similar rates781617 .
although we did not examine the germline transmission of crispr / cas - induced mutant alleles , all of the examined talen - induced alleles were transmitted to the next generation .
gene targeting method using talen and crispr / cas system is spreading explosively , however , the indels which are multiple of three need be taken care of. embryos 143 - # 4 ( - 1 / - 6 ) , # 13 ( - 1 / - 18 / - 24 ) and # 23 ( - 3 / - 7 ) appeared normal without possessing wild - type alleles .
an embryo with the - 9 / - 30 + 2 alleles also exhibited a normal phenotype ( table 2 ). from the sequence homology , the crystal structure of human fgf10 is anticipated to adopt a beta - trefoil fold consisting of 12 beta - strands ( beta1 - beta12 ) after the n - terminal 310 helix35 .
the region upstream of the 310 helix was selected as the target site for the talen system .
therefore , in - frame indels upstream of the beta - trefoil fold structure , which is the target site of talen and crispr _ 143 , may not affect the fgf10 protein function .
to create gene - knockout animals , the exon including the start codon or a common exon among splice variants is generally chosen as the target locus .
sekine et al. generated fgf10 - deficient mice by replacing the exon encoding the atg translational start site with the neomycin cassette19 .
thus far , it has not been realistic to identify the functional domain of a protein in vivo by deletion analysis , although this approach is often performed for cultured cells .
in the present study , we also targeted exon 3 in the mouse fgf10 gene , which corresponds to several reported human alsg mutations .
the target site overlaps with the beta11 strand of the fgf10 protein for crispr _ 547 and is located between the beta11 and beta12 strands of crispr _ 563 .
lys - 196 ( next to the protospacer adjacent motif [ pam ]) of crispr _ 563 ) and his - 201 ( in the beta12 strand ) are important residues for the secondary ligand - receptor interaction in the fgf10 - fgfr2b complex36 .
termination at arg - 194 next to the pam sequence of crispr _ 563 leads to alsg23 .
a histidine - to - proline substitution downstream of the beta12 strand was not related to alsg37 , although the histidine residue is not conserved in mouse fgf10 .
crispr _ 547 and 563 produced embryos with limb - defect phenotypes at a strikingly higher rate ( up to ~ 100 %) than talen ( up to ~ 10 % ; table 3 ) .
moreover , the complete limb - deficiency phenotype was observed for embryo 547 - # 8 , which possessed in - frame indels in almost half of the examined clones , and embryo 547 - # 10 , which possessed only in - frame indels .
these previous findings confirm the in vivo importance of the beta11 - beta12 loop at the c - terminus of fgf10 .
mosaicism and abnormal limb development were occasionally observed in embryos treated by talens or crispr / cas ( figs. 1 , 3 , and s1 ) .
embryos with mosaic phenotypes ( e.g. talen _ ld - # 2 , crispr _ 143 - # 3 , # 15 , # 18 , # 20 , # 21 , crispr _ 563 - # 16 , # 17 and # 19 ) carried frame - shift alleles , wild - type alleles or in - frame indels ( fig. 2 , 4 , 5 ) .
because the target sites of talen and crispr _ 143 are upstream of the 310 helix and beta - strands , in - frame indels of the - 1 + 1 allele in talen _ ld - # 2 ( 1 / 23 clones ) and the - 3 + 3 allele in crispr _ 143 - # 18 ( 3 / 37 clones ) did not affect the functional structure of the fgf10 protein , which might lead to mosaic phenotypes without wild - type alleles .
however , embryos 547 - # 8 and # 10 , in which half or all of the clones were in - frame indels , exhibited the complete limb - deficiency phenotype .
these observations suggest that selecting a target site in important domains may be important for effectively disrupting the gene function .
the crispr / cas system has some advantages for genome editing , including easier preparation of the constructs compared to talens .
however , the off - target cleavage rate may be high for short or single target sequences .
a high frequency of off - target mutagenesis for the crispr / cas system was reported in human cultured cells3839 and some in vivo mouse analyses16404142 .
using cas9 nickase would efficiently reduce the damage at known off - target sites4344 .
although we did not investigate the off - target mutagenesis rate , we efficiently obtained the expected phenotypes at the f0 generation through several different target sites in the fgf10 gene , especially by the crispr / cas system .
in conclusion , we have described the differences in effects on the same target region or gene between the talen and crispr / cas systems .
the crispr / cas system showed extremely high rates of nhej events in multiple alleles and , similar to the talen system , is an excellent tool to accelerate functional genomic research in mice .

production of talen mrna talen plasmids targeting the mouse fgf10 exon1 sequences were synthesized by transposagen biopharmaceuticals , inc .
( lexington , ky ) .
to prepare mrna for fgf10 , talen plasmid linearization with stui and phenol - chloroform extraction were performed by standard methods .
the mrnas were generated in vitro with the mmessage mmachine t7 ultra kit ( ambion , austin , tx ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
after ethanol precipitation , mrnas were suspended in an appropriate volume of rnase - free water to achieve final concentrations of 10 , 20 and 50 ng / mul .
production of cas9 mrna and sgrna the cas9 plasmid ( pmlm3613 ) was purchased from addgene ( cambridge , ma ) .
for sgrna production , two different forward and reverse primers for target sequences of fgf10 were annealed and cloned into the bsai site of the pdr274 - encoding sgrna .
cas9 mrna and sgrnas were transcribed using pmei - digested cas9 and drai - digested grna expression vectors as templates by the mmessage mmachine t7 ultra kit .
after transcription was complete , dnase i treatment was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
cas9 - encoding mrna and sgrna were purified by licl and isopropanol precipitation .
they were suspended in an appropriate volume of rnase - free water .
rna concentrations for microinjection were estimated from the bands and dna markers .
rna microinjection into one - cell mouse embryos talen mrnas were microinjected into the cytoplasm or pronuclei of fertilized eggs derived from superovulated bdf1 ( c57bl / 6 x dba2 f1 ) female mice crossed with males of the same strain at 0.5 dpc .
for cas9 - encoding mrna and sgrna , those rnas were coinjected into the cytoplasm .
injected eggs were cultured overnight in m16 medium ( sigma ) at 37degreesc with 5 % co2 .
resulting two - cell embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudo - pregnant mch / icr females .
analysis of mutations by surveyor nucleases to detect fgf10 talen - and crispr - induced mutations in f0 embryos , genomic dna was extracted from the tail tips of fetuses and newborns .
targeted genomic loci were amplified by using the kod - plus - neo ( toyobo , osaka , japan ) dna polymerase with 3 ' to 5 ' proofreading exonuclease activity , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
primers were designed to anneal ~ 200 to 250 bp upstream and downstream from the expected cut sites .
pcr was carried out with the following oligonucleotides : ex1f ( 5 ' - cagcaggtct tacccttcca - 3 ') and ex1r ( 5 ' - tacaggggtt ggggacataa - 3 ') were used to amplify a 521 - bp fragment surrounding the target site in exon1 .
ex3f ( 5 ' - tgactcttct gttgttagcgt tg - 3 ') and ex3r ( 5 ' - acatccaaag ccttccttcc - 3 ') were used to amplify a 501 - bp fragment surrounding the target site in exon3 .
to allow complementary but mismatched strands to anneal , pcr products ( 400 ng ) , purified by the wizard sv gel and pcr clean - up system ( promega ) , were incubated at 95degreesc for 5 min in 10 mm tris - hcl ( ph 8.5 ) , 75 mm kcl and 1.5 mm mgcl2 .
nuclease s ( 0.4 mul ) and enhancer s ( 0.4 mul ) ( surveyor mutation detection kit , transgenomic , omaha , ne ) were added .

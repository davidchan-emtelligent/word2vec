background cancer patients have a higher risk of severe sepsis in comparison with non - cancer patients , with an increased risk for hospital - acquired infections ( hai ) , particularly with multidrug resistant bacteria ( mdrb ) .
the aim of the study is to describe the frequency and characteristics of hai and mdrb in critically ill cancer patients .
methods we conducted an 18 - month prospective study in patients admitted >= 48 h to an icu at a cancer referral center in mexico .
patients with hematological malignancies ( hm ) were compared with solid tumors .
demographic and clinical data were recorded .
mortality was evaluated at 30 - days .
results there were 351 admissions during the study period , among whom 157 ( 66 %) met the inclusion criteria of the study as follows : 104 patients with solid tumors and 53 with hm. sixty - four patients ( 40.7 %) developed 95 episodes of hai .
hai rate was 4.6 / 100 patients - days .
mdrb were isolated in 38 patients ( 24 %) , with no differences between both groups .
escherichia coli was the main bacteria isolated ( n = 24 ) , 78 % were extended spectrum beta - lactamases producers .
the only risk factor associated with hai was the presence of mechanical ventilation for more than 5 days ( or 3.12 , 95 % ci 1.6 - 6.2 , p = 0.001 ) .
at 30 - day follow - up , 61 patients ( 39 %) have died ( 38 % with solid tumors and 60 % with hm , p < 0.001 ) .
no differences were found in mortality at 30 - day between patients with hai ( n = 25 , 39 %) vs. non - hai ( n = 36 , 38.7 % , p = 0.964 ) ; neither in those who developed a hai with mdrb ( n = 12 , 35.3 %) vs. hai with non - mdrb ( n = 13 , 43.3 % , p = 0.51 ) .
conclusions patients with cancer who are admitted to an icu , have a high risk of hai , but there were no differences patients with solid or hematologic malignancies .
keywords hospital - acquired infections intensive care unit multidrug resistance bacteria mortality issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background critically ill patients in the intensive care unit ( icu ) are at major risk of hospital - acquired infections ( hai ) , related with mechanical ventilation , invasive devices , the use of broad - spectrum antibiotics , and parenteral nutrition , among others [ 1 ] .
prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is extremely useful in severely ill patients .
after results of cultures are obtained , treatment should be re - evaluated to either de - escalate or escalate the antibiotic prescription .
this is associated with optimal costs , decreased incidence of superinfection and minimal development of antimicrobial resistance [ 2 ] .
furthermore , cancer patients have a 3 - to 5 - fold greater risk of severe sepsis in comparison with non - cancer patients , with an increased risk for hai , particularly with multidrug resistant bacteria ( mdrb ) , which are associated with increased therapeutic failure and high mortality rates [ 3 - 8 ] .
patients with neutropenia or hematological malignancies ( hm ) appear to be particularly vulnerable to this situation , compared with patients with solid tumors [ 9 ] .
the aim of this study was to describe the frequency and characteristics of hai and mdrb in critically ill patients admitted to an icu at a cancer referral center during an 18 - month period , and to compare patients with solid tumors vs. those with hm. methods the national cancer institute ( incan ) in mexico is a 135 - bed referral teaching hospital located in mexico city for adult patients with cancer , with an average of 170,000 medical visits , 7,500 hospital discharges , and 3,500 major surgical procedures per year .
the icu is a six - bed service that serves both surgical and medical patients .
all antimicrobial prescriptions are supervised and adjusted on a regular basis by infectious diseases specialists .
we conducted an 18 - month prospective study of hai in patients admitted at the icu from march 2013 to september 2014 .
the study was approved by the instituto nacional de cancerologia ethics review board (" comite de etica en investigacion " - incan / ci / 410 / 15 ) .
consent was not obtained but patient information was anonymous and de - identified prior to analysis .
all patients hospitalized in the icu for >= 48 h were included .
the following information was recorded : age , sex , comorbidities , hospitalization and antimicrobials in the previous 3 months , treatment with chemotherapy , radiotherapy or immunotherapy , type of cancer ( classified as solid or hm ) , current status of cancer ( complete or partial remission , recent diagnosis , relapsed or progression ) , stage of disease , reason for icu admission , time from hospital to icu admission , severity of illness score using acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ( apache ii ) , organ dysfunctions using sequential organ failure assessment score ( sofa ) , length of icu stay , and icu mortality rate .
cultures from blood , urine , surgical site , bronchial secretions , and from any other site with clinical suspicion of infection were performed based on the judgment of the treating physician .
bacteria were cultured using standard microbiological methods .
antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by means of the bd automated phoenix ( tm ) ( usa ) and the kirby - bauer disk diffusion technique in case of resistant strains ( clinical laboratory standards institute , clsi ) [ 10 ] .
the microorganisms isolated and their susceptibility was recorded .
the following mdrb were evaluated : methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) ; vancomycin - resistant enterococcus faecium ( vre ) ; extended - spectrum beta - lactamases ( esbl ) escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. ; pseudomonas aeruginosa , and acinetobacter spp. resistant to third generation cephalosporins and carbapenems .
other gram - negative bacteria were considered mdr if they were resistant to fluoroquinolones , third generation cephalosporins , and carbapenems [ 11 ] .
infections occurring at more than one site in the same patient were reported as separated infection events , unless the same bacterium was isolated concurrently .
hai were defined using centers for disease control and prevention criteria ( cdc , 2014 ) [ 12 ] , and were classified as follows : central line - associated bloodstream infection ( clabsi ) ; surgical site infection ( ssi ) ; ventilator - associated pneumonia ( vap ) ; abdominal sepsis , and catheter - associated urinary tract infections ( ca - uti ) .
number of ventilator - days , number of central venous catheter ( cvc ) days , and urinary catheter - days were also recorded .
mortality and the cause related were evaluated on days 7 , 30 and 90 , after icu hospitalization .
statistical analysis the student t test or the mann - whitney u test were used to compare continuous variables depending on whether they exhibited a normal or non - normal data distribution , respectively , and the chi - square or the fisher exact test were used to compare categorical variables .
variables with p values < 0.5 in the univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis .
a logistic regression analysis was performed for predicting risk for hai .
a cox regression model was performed for survival analysis .
odds ratios ( rr ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % ci ) were calculated .
rates of overall survival were estimated by means of the kaplan - meier method and log - rank test .
p values <= 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
device utilization ratios , site - specific cumulative incidence rates per 100 patients , and site - specific incidence densities per 1,000 days at risk or per 1,000 catheter - days were calculated .
data was analyzed using epi - info ( ver. 7 ) and stata ( ver. 12 ) software .
results three hundred fifty - one patients were hospitalized at the icu during the study period .
one hundred fifty - seven ( 66 %) patients remained at the icu for >= 48 h and were included in the study as follows : 104 patients with solid tumors ( 66 %) , and 53 with hematological malignancies ( 34 %) .
eighty patients ( 51 %) were male ; mean age was 48 +/ - 15 years .
colorectal cancer and liver / biliary tract were the most frequently solid tumors documented .
leukemia ( 45.3 %) and lymphoma ( 37 %) were the main hm included .
most of the patients ( 63.8 %) were in advanced stages of oncological disease stages ( iii or iv ) ; 27 patients ( 17.2 %) had metastases .
the most common causes of icu admission were different between both groups : patients with solid tumors were admitted with hypovolemic shock ( 26.9 %) and respiratory failure ( 24 %) ; while patients with hm had respiratory failure ( 54.7 %) and septic shock ( 26.4 %) .
hm patients had received chemotherapy , radiotherapy or had been hospitalized recently with higher frequency compared with solid tumors .
other clinical and demographic characteristics are shown in table 1 .

mdrb were identified in 35 patients ( 24.2 %) , with no differences between both groups ( p = 0.94 ) .
escherichia coli was the most frequent bacterium isolated ( 78 % were esbl producers ) .
other bacteria are shown in fig. 1. fig. 1 main bacteria isolated in patients with hospital - acquired infection at the intensive care unit ( hai - icu ) , divided into susceptible and multidrug - resistant bacteria ( mdrb ) .
the percentage was obtained from the total number of microbiological isolates ( n = 172 ) regarding fungi , there were seven candidemia episodes ( three due to candida glabrata , two due to c. tropicalis , one due to c. parapsilosis , and one due to c. albicans ) .
three candidemia episodes were associated with severe neutropenia , two with cvc infection , and two with parenteral nutrition .
six of these patients died ( 86 %) , in a mean time of eight days since candida growth .
aspergillus spp. was identified in broncho - alveolar samples , three patients ( two a. fumigatus and one a. flavus ) , all with hematologic malignancies , severe neutropenia and lung nodules in scan tomography .
two patients with aspergillus died .
concomitant infections were documented in 19 patients ; two different bacteria were documented in 15 patients ( three with abdominal sepsis , eight with pneumonia and four with ssi ) , one patient had influenza virus with a bacterial co - infection , one patient with clabsi had a candida plus a bacteria , and two patients with ssi had two different bacteria plus candida .
in the logistic regression model , over five days of mechanical ventilation was the only statistically significant factor for hai ( or 3.12 , 95 % ci 1.6 - 6.2 , p = 0.001 ) .
30 - days overall mortality was 61 patients ( 39 %) : 29 ( 28 %) with solid tumors and 32 ( 60.3 %) with hm ( p < 0.001 ) .
sixty - one patients died at 30 - day follow - up , no differences were found between patients with hai ( n = 25 , 39 %) vs. non - hai ( n = 36 , 38.7 % , 0.964 ) ; neither at 90 - day follow - up ( n = 27 , 42.2 % vs. n = 52 , 55.9 % , respectively , p = 0.09 ) .
no differences were found in mortality at 30 - day between patients who developed a hai with mdrb ( n = 12 , 35.3 %) vs. hai with non - mdrb ( n = 13 , 43.3 % , p = 0.51 ) fig. 2. fig. 2 kaplan - meier survival curve .
30 - day mortality of patients with solid tumors vs. hematologic malignancies discussion in oncological patients , the interaction of multiple factors related to immune supression , skin or mucosal disruption , extensive antibiotic use , complex surgical procedures and the presence of invasive devices , augment the risk of hais , leading to an increase in the length of hospital stay , morbidity and mortality [ 13 ] .
as a result , the number of patients admitted to the icu , either for cancer - related complications or for treatment - associated side effects is steadily increasing [ 9 ] .
although we did not specify the chemotherapy regimens , it is important to consider that hematologic patients , particularly with acute leukaemias , aggressive regimens amplify disease - induced immunosupression and result in severe and long lasting neutropenias which could favour the development of severe infections .
this was not confirmed in this study , most likely because of the low number of patients with this disease .
some studies describe as the main reasons to the icu admission , septic shock , respiratory failure and hypovolemic shock secondary to extensive surgical resection in patients with solid tumors .
in this study we found differences for icu admission in both groups : in patients with hm the most frequent cause was respiratory failure ( 54.7 %) , it was related to several causes such as pneumonia , acute respiratory distress syndrome , diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary embolisms .
however , in patients with solid tumors the main reason for icu admission was hypovolemic shock secondary to schedule or emergency surgical resection ( 29.9 %) .
this percentage was higher than the one reported in other study performed in the same icu ( 31.6 % for septic and hypovolemic shock ) [ 14 ] .
reports from other parts of the world not even include hypovolemic shock within the first causes of admission to icu [ 15 - 17 ] .
one possible explanation for the high percentage we found , is that patients admitted to our hospital have advanced cancer stages , with tumor adhesion to adjacent organs , therefore require extensive surgeries , with multiple organ resection , which increases bleeds and surgical morbidity .
hai prevalence varies among hospitals and among countries .
there has been reported an increase in patients with cancer during the last decade [ 18 ] .
some studies have reported a wide variation rate between 5.3 and 56.1 % [ 19 ] .
our hai rate was 40.7 % .
the most frequent infection was vap ( 26.7 % , 28.4 / 1,000 ventilator - days ) .
the vap rate was similar to the ones described in other icus in developing countries ( 24.1 / 1,000 ventilator - days ) [ 20 ] .
more than five days of mechanical ventilation was the only risk factor associated to hai in multivariate analysis ( or 3.12 , ci 95 % 1.6 - 6.2 , p = 0.001 ) , as has been reported previously [ 21 ] .
surgical site infection ( ssi ) was the second hai documented : 72 surgeries were performed during the study period ; the infection rate was 16.7 ( the ssi infection rate reported during 2013 in our institution was 9.9 ) .
it is relevant to highlight that 28 % of the surgeries were emergency procedures , and the majority of these comprised complicated and extensive interventions .
in various reports , ca - utis are described as the most common nosocomial infection ( around 40 %) [ 22 ] .
these infections do not cause severe mortality or morbidity , but can progress into severe infections such as secondary bacteremia or septic shock , in addition to significantly increasing the hospital costs [ 23 ] .
we found ca - uti as the third hai in the icu ( 13.4 % , 8.9 infections / 1,000 catheter - days ) , as the same as reported by other authors [ 20 ] .
median of indwelling urinary catheter stay were 16 days in patients with ca - uti compared with 10 days in non - ca - uti patients .
the clabsi rate was 2.5 % ( 1 infection / 1,000 catheter - days ) .
in some u.s. studies , which report prevalence , the range varies from 1.8 to 7.6 / 1,000 catheter - days [ 24 ] .
in one research conducted in eight developing countries , the rate varied between 4.2 and 14.4 / 1,000 catheter - days [ 17 ] .
the low rate found in this series is attributed to strict standardized protocol of care provided by an intravenous therapy team nurses working for over two decades [ 25 , 26 ]. e. coli was the most frequent pathogen isolated , 78 % were esbl producers .
this percentage is considerably higher than reported elsewhere in our country ( range between 33 and 51 %) [ 27 - 29 ] , but it is important to note that these studies included patients hospitalized in different wards , not only from icu where the prevalence of mdrb is usually higher .
in recent years , widespread mdrb in hospitals had complicated the medical care and infection prevention measures .
mdrb pathogens are associated with worse outcomes related with inferior therapeutic options and delay in initiation of appropriate therapy , and probably with increased virulence of these strains [ 30 ] .
in this study we found 24.2 % of mdrb , which is lower when compared to a retrospective study performed from 2007 to 2011 in the same icu , when the hai rate was 39.7 % [ 31 ] .
in another mexican study with patients admitted in icu , the incidence of mdrb was 64.5 % [ 32 ] .
in this report , overall 30 - day mortality was 39 % with ranges between 28 % in patients with solid tumors until 60.4 % in hm group .
the poor prognosis of patients with hm , especially those who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) , has been well documented [ 17 ] .
we did not have hsct patients because they are treated exclusively in the transplant unit .
we found a difference in mortality related with the cause of admission to icu : 60 % in patients admitted with respiratory failure , 29.4 % in patients with septic shock and 10.3 % in scheduled surgical patients , but this could be related with the oncology disease , because hm patients had also more frequently respiratory failure .
in another study , that included oncology patients admitted at the icu , the overall hospital mortality was 30 % , ( range , 10 % to 70 %) [ 9 , 17 ] .
early management of organ dysfunction is crucial in the treatment of critically ill patients ; late icu admission has been associated with greater mortality [ 9 ] .
we found a significant delay in icu admission in patients with hm ( median 2 days compared solid tumors median 0 days ) , which could be also related with higher mortality in these patients .
infection control measures are strict in our icu : at admission , two blood cultures , urine , respiratory secretions and other cultures are required ; broad - spectrum antibiotics are initiated as soon as patient arrival .
an antimicrobial re - evaluation is made in the first 48 - 72 h when cultures results are available and according to clinical evolution to either de - escalate or escalate the antibiotic prescription ; antibiotics schemes are discussed and reviewed periodically with all staff ( intensive care , infectious disease and medical or surgical oncologists physicians ) ; the duration of antimicrobials treatment are shortened as much as possible ; surveillance hand hygiene program , and follow antibiotic prophylaxis guides [ 2 ] .
some limitations of this study are that the results correspond to a single - center and did not obtain data related to the long - term survival .
however , we believe these results provide insight into the prevalence of hai , particularly mdrb at a cancer referral center , and can be extrapolate results to other hospitals with similar characteristics .
conclusions our study indicates that the prevalence of hai is similar than other reports performed in cancer patients .
there were no differences between patients with hai vs. non - hai , neither in those who had a mdrb isolated .
adherence to the guidelines for the prevention and control of infections are the most useful tool to decrease hai infections and improve outcomes in susceptible patients .

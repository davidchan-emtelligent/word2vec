the internal ph ( phi ) of a living cell is one of its most important physiological parameters .
to monitor the ph inside bacillus subtilis during various stages of its life cycle , we constructed an improved version ( iphluorin ) of the ratiometric , ph - sensitive fluorescent protein phluorin by extending it at the 5 ' end with the first 24 bp of comga .
the new version , which showed an approximate 40 % increase in fluorescence intensity , was expressed from developmental phase - specific , native promoters of b. subtilis that are specifically active during vegetative growth on glucose ( pptsg ) or during sporulation ( pspoiia , pspoiiid , and psspe ) .
our results show strong , compartment - specific expression of iphluorin that allowed accurate phi measurements of live cultures during exponential growth , early and late sporulation , spore germination , and during subsequent spore outgrowth .
dormant spores were characterized by an phi of 6.0 +/ - 0.3 .
upon full germination the phi rose dependent on the medium to 7.0 - 7.4 .
the presence of sorbic acid in the germination medium inhibited a rise in the intracellular ph of germinating spores and inhibited germination .
such effects were absent when acetic was added at identical concentrations .
bacterial spore formers spores spore germination intracellular ph gfp phluorin weak organic acids uncouplers introduction the internal ph ( phi ) of living cells plays a fundamental role in many chemical reactions .
many intracellular enzymes show optimal activity and stability in a narrow ph range near neutrality .
furthermore , in many organisms proton gradients are required for the greater part of atp synthesis while uptake systems often depend on the proton gradient over the cell membrane ( krulwich et al. , 1998 , 2011 ; slonczewski et al. , 2009 ) .
in the model eukaryote saccharomyces cerevisiae , phi was found to be a signal controlling growth ( orij et al. , 2011 ) .
gene expression as a response to glucose starvation was found to be mediated by changes in the phi , through the protonation state - dependent binding of a transcription factor to membrane - associated phosphatidic acid ( young et al. , 2010 ) .
in multicellular eukaryotes phi is thought to be important during growth and differentiation ( cruciat et al. , 2010 ) .
in prokaryotic organisms , the relationships between phi and growth and development have not been studied extensively ( padan and schuldiner , 1987 ) .
because of its various well - described differentiation modes , b. subtilis is generally considered to be the bacterial model organism for cellular differentiation .
the best described mode of differentiation of this gram - positive prokaryote is sporulation , with the pathways controlling sporulation understood in great molecular detail ( eichenberger et al. , 2004 ; steil et al. , 2005 ; wang et al. , 2006 ) .
germination is less well understood , but keijser et al .
( 2007 ) have shown that this too , is a carefully orchestrated process .
we reasoned that in analogy to eukaryotes , phi could be a global regulator , as well as an indicator of the metabolic and energetic state of the cell .
to gain further insight in the putative phi dynamics of these differentiation processes , we studied the phi of the mother cell and fore - spore independently .
during sporulation the development of the phi in the mother cell and the nascent fore - spore may also give insight in the level of independence of the two cells .
in b. subtilis , the phi of the developing pre - spore is generally assumed to drop to ph = 6.0 - 6.4 during sporulation ( magill et al. , 1994 ) .
the drop in ph causes a decrease in activity of phosphoglycerate mutase ( pgm ) , which catalyses the conversion of 3 - phosphoglycerate ( 3 - pga ) to 2 - phosphoglycerate .
the reduced activity of pgm causes the accumulation of 3 - pga in the pre - spore. b. subtilis spores are metabolically dormant and contain no measurable atp or glucose that could act as energy source during spore germination ( singh et al. , 1977 ; magill et al. , 1996 ) .
it is assumed that the accumulated 3 - pga serves as an initial carbon and energy source for the cell .
the cell 's phi can be measured with various methods .
ideally , intracellular ph measurements should be conducted in systems containing good 's buffers ( good et al. , 1966 ; ferguson et al. , 1980 ) , to minimize the effect of the cell 's surrounding ( unless desired ) .
the probe used to measure ph should maintain accuracy over the ph range assessed .
in addition , both the presence of the probe itself in a cell as well as the detection method applied should have minimal effect on cell physiology .
currently used techniques include the distribution of radiolabeled membrane - permeant weak acids , 31p nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , fluorescent dyes ( e.g. , carboxyfluorescein , carboxyfluorescein diacetate , and succinimidyl ester ; ugurbil et al. , 1978 ; booth , 1985 ; bulthuis et al. , 1993 ; magill et al. , 1994 ; breeuwer et al. , 1996 ; leuschner and lillford , 2000 ) .
these methods have the advantage that no genetic modification is required and in the case of fluorescent dyes , single cell measurements are possible ( slonczewski et al. , 2009 ) .
weak acid dyes or reporters may alter the phi and are therefore difficult to use accurately , and may require many treatment and incubation steps before measurement .
31p nmr and radiolabeled compounds require extensive cell handling and high cell density , which also disturb cell physiology .
another useful method is the use of fluorescent proteins [ green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) derivatives ] .
this does require the organism to be genetically accessible but allows direct , fast , and localized ph measurements .
in our lab , we have successfully used ratiometric phluorin ( miesenbock et al. , 1998 ) for a number of years in s. cerevisiae ( orij et al. , 2011 ; ullah et al. , 2012 ) , and more recently also in b. subtilis ( ter beek , 2009 ) .
however , the codon usage of phluorin was not optimized for use in b. subtilis .
our initial experiments suggested that our results might benefit from an increase in fluorescence intensity .
this might be achieved by improving translation initiation ( veening et al. , 2004 ) .
we therefore fused the first eight amino acids of comga to phluorin ( veening et al. , 2004 ) , as this was shown to improve the signal strength of cyan fluorescent protein ( cfp ) and yellow fluorescent protein ( yfp ) .
the ph - dependent ratiometric fluorescent properties of iphluorin were not affected by this fusion .
to monitor the phi of both the mother cell and the pre - spore , ratiometric gfp - based iphluorin was expressed from a number of developmental phase - specific native promoters of b. subtilis ( hilbert , 2004 ) .
expression of iphluorin resulted in strong , compartmentalized , and cell type - specific signals .
this allowed us to monitor the phi during growth and sporulation , in both pre - spore , mother cell and mature spore , as well as during spore germination .
effects of the addition of sorbic and acetic acid on the phi of germinating spores are described .
materials and methods strains and growth conditions for general purpose growth , escherichia coli mc1061 and b. subtilis pb2 strains were grown in lysogeny broth ( lb ) .
for fluorescence measurements , b. subtilis strains were grown in defined liquid medium ( m3g ; keijser et al. , 2007 ) buffered at ph = 5.5 or 6.4 with 80 mm 2 - ( n - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid ( mes ) , or at ph = 7.0 or 7.4 with 80 mm 3 - ( n - morpholino ) propanesulfonic acid ( mops ) .
all cultures were grown at 37degreesc , under continuous agitation at 200 rpm .
when required , the following antibiotics were added : kanamycin for strains carrying pdg148 - derived plasmids ; 10 mug / ml for b. subtilis strains , 50 mug / ml for e. coli strains , spectinomycin for strains carrying psg1729 - derived plasmids or genomic inserts ( 50 mug / ml ) .
the strains used in this study are listed in table 1 .

cultures were incubated for 4 days at 37degreesc under continuous agitation ( 200 rpm ) .
spores were harvested and purified by extensive washing with milliq water at 4degreesc .
the spore crops were inspected by phase - contrast microscopy and were free (> 99 %) of vegetative cells , germinating spores , and debris .
spores were stored for up to 1 week in milliq water at 4degreesc at optical density ( od ) 600 = 1 .
cloning of promoter fusions with iphluorin our initial experiments suggested that the accuracy of ph measurements might benefit from increased expression of phluorin .
to improve translation efficiency , the first 24 bp of comga , with an atg start codon , were fused to phluorin by a polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) with pfu polymerase using primers iphlu _ 2010 _ fw and iphlu _ 2010 _ rv .
this sequence was subsequently extended with a standard shine - dalgarno ( sd ) region ( aaggaggaagcaggt ; joseph et al. , 2001 ) using primers iphlu _ pdga _ fw .
this sd - improved phluorin ( iphluorin ) was inserted between the hindiii and sali sites of pdg148 .
this construct , pdg - iphluorin , was transformed into b. subtilis pb2 and compared with pb2 carrying pdg - phluorin to analyze expression levels and ph - dependent characteristics of phluorin and iphluorin .
also , a xylose - inducible , genome - integrated expression system was constructed .
to this end , iphluorin was inserted in psg1729 , between the avrii and hindiii sites , thereby replacing gfp and placing iphluorin under control of the xylose - inducible pxyl promoter .
to monitor the phi of b. subtilis for extended periods of time in different phases of its life cycle , without the need for externally supplied expression inducers , the promoter region of several growth phase - specific genes ( pptsg , for vegetative cells growing on glucose , pspoiia , specific for pre - septum , sporulating cells , psspe , a fore - spore - specific gene , and pspoiiid , a mother cell - specific promoter ) of b. subtilis were selected for their expression levels ( steil et al. , 2005 ; veening et al. , 2006a ) .
approximately 500 bp upstream of the start codon were selected for cloning. by standardizing the sd region , we aimed to increase and standardize the expression levels of poorer promoter sites ( ozbudak et al. , 2002 ; botella et al. , 2010 ) .
the promoter and sd - iphluorin sequences were fused by a pcr and inserted in psg1729 , between the avrii and hindiii sites , thereby replacing the gfp and placing iphluorin under control of a b. subtilis promoter .
all enzymes used were obtained from fermentas ( thermo fisher scientific ) .
bacillus subtilis pb2 was used as target for our transformations. b. subtilis cells were made transformation - competent as described before ( kunst and rapoport , 1995 ) .
the newly constructed plasmids were integrated in the amye locus as described ( lewis and marston , 1999 ) .

calibration of iphluorin bacillus subtilis pb2 containing either pdg148 , pdg - phluorin or pdg - iphluorin were grown to exponential phase in m3g at ph 7.0 containing 10 mug / ml kanamycin .
bacterial growth and expression levels of ratiometric phluorin and iphluorin were monitored in a fluostar optima ( bmg labtech , germany ) for 3 h after addition of 0 - 1 mm isopropyl beta - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( iptg ) .
for calibration of the ph , expression of ratiometric phluorin and iphluorin was induced for 2.5 h by the addition of 1 mm iptg .
at od600 = 0.4 the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in buffers with ph values ranging from 5.0 to 8.5 prepared from 0.1 m citric acid and 0.2 m k2hpo4 .
the intracellular and extracellular ph were equilibrated by the addition of 1 mum valinomycin and 1 mum nigericin ( breeuwer et al. , 1996 ) .
cells were transferred to black - walled microtiter plates and incubated at 37degreesc in a fluostar optima .
od600 was measured before start of the experiment .
the ratio of emission intensity at 510 nm resulting from excitation at 390 and 470 nm ( with photomultiplier gain set to 2,000 ) was calculated as described previously ( orij et al. , 2011 ) .
fluorescence and od600 were monitored for 30 min , with measurements taken every 5 min .
calibration curves for phluorin and iphluorin were identical , with only minor fluctuations in fluorescence in time observed with phluorin at ph = 8.5. from this , we concluded that the intracellular and extracellular ph had equilibrated rapidly. b. subtilis pb2 carrying pdg148 was measured for background fluorescence .
background fluorescence was subtracted at individual wavelengths before calculating the ratio .
the calibration curve was determined by fitting the data of three independent biological replicates , each consisting of three technical replicates , with a polynomial curve of the third order .
batch measurements of phi during sporulation , germination , and outgrowth to monitor phi during growth and sporulation , all b. subtilis strains , wild - type ( wt ) ( pb2 ) and those with iphluorin fused to endogenous promoters were grown as described , in m3s without antibiotics , ph 7.0 , to an od600 = 0.1 in an incubator at 37degreesc under continuous agitation ( 200 rpm ) .
cell suspensions were diluted twofold by adding 50 mul of culture to 50 mul of medium in black microtiter plates which were then monitored in a fluorostar optima bmg ( labtech , germany ) at 37degreesc .
od600 and ph measurements were taken every 10 min for 48 h. the plates were shaken ( 200 rpm ) in between measurements thus ensuring optimal growth ( ter beek , 2009 ) .
for spore germination , washed spores were heat activated ( 30 min , 70degreesc , then cooled on ice ) and subsequently mixed 1:1 with 2x concentrated m3 with or without glucose , containing weak organic acid ( woa ) in predetermined concentrations .
to trigger germination , 5 mul 20x concentrated agfk ( 10 mm l - asparagine , 10 mm d - glucose , 1 mm d - fructose , 1 mm kcl ; wax and freese , 1968 ) was added .
microtiter plates were placed in a fluostar optima ( bmg labtech , germany ) at 37degreesc and shaken between measurements ( 200 rpm ) .
growth was monitored for 2 - 12 h , with ph and od600 measurements taken every 10 min .
microscopy to verify if expression of iphluorin was correctly localized , b. subtilis cells were cultured as described above for batch measurements at ph = 7.0 .
all strains were grown as described to exponential phase or for 16 - 24 h to observe sporulating cells .
cells were immobilized on 1 % agarose ( koppelman et al. , 2004 ) , and photographed with a coolsnap fx ( photometrics ) charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera mounted on an olympus bx - 60 fluorescence microscope through an uplanfl 100x / 1.3 oil objective ( japan ) with a 41017 - endow gfp / egfp bandpass filter ( chroma technology corp. , bellows falls , vt , usa ) .
results improved expression of phluorin many microorganisms have an internal ( cytosolic and / or mitochondrial ) ph between 7 and 8 ( orij et al. , 2009 ; slonczewski et al. , 2009 ) during optimal growth and maintaining ph homeostasis is of vital importance for most , including b. subtilis where phi differences have been inferred for its various developmental phases .
we now used the ph - sensitive gfp phluorin , developed for yeast ( miesenbock et al. , 1998 ) , to directly measure on - line the phi dynamics in b. subtilis .
codon usage of this gfp was not optimized for b. subtilis and our initial experiments suggested that expression might be improved .
it was shown previously that addition of the first eight amino acids of comga improved translation initiation efficiency of cfp and yfp in b. subtilis ( veening et al. , 2004 ) .
we used this approach to construct improved phluorin ( iphluorin ; figure 1a ) .

to analyze fluorescence intensity of bacillus cells harboring pdg148 , pdg - phluorin , or pdg - iphluorin cells were transferred to microtiter plates containing 0 - 1 mm iptg to induce expression .
cell growth was monitored for 3 h , together with fluorescence emission at 510 nm upon excitation at 390 and 470 nm. the three strains compared had identical growth rates ( not shown ) .
fluorescence intensity after 2.5 h is shown in figure 1b , and depended on the concentration of iptg .
cells expressing iphluorin had the highest signal intensity at 1 mm iptg , approximately 40 % higher than phluorin under the same conditions .
the most important characteristic of phluorin is its shift in excitation wavelength depending on the ph of its surroundings .
to establish if the addition of eight amino acids at the n - terminus would alter these characteristics , calibration curves for phluorin and iphluorin were made ( figure 1c for iphluorin , not shown for phluorin ) .
both growth rate and the ratiometric characteristics were similar and allowed reliable phi readings in a range between ph 5 and 8.5 in live b. subtilis cultures .
the internal ph varies with growth phase the cytosolic ph is a crucial parameter for bacteria because it modulates the activity of many enzymes ( vojinovic and von stockar , 2009 ) and in many species plays a crucial role in generating the proton - motive force ( shioi et al. , 1980 ; slonczewski et al. , 2009 ) .
to monitor phi during various stages of growth in bacillus , we fused promoters of strongly expressed , growth phase - specific genes to iphluorin .
this allowed us to measure phi of b. subtilis without addition of inducers such as iptg or xylose ( figures 2a - h ) .
the selected promoters and their specific expression phase are shown in table 4 .

pptsg is a strong promoter during vegetative growth on glucose ( botella et al. , 2010 ) .
expression of iphluorin from the pptsg promoter follows the growth curve closely ( figure 3a ) .
when the cells die or move into stationary phase ( after 7.5 h ) , the signal intensity remains high and stable .
the sporulation - specific promoters ( figure 4b ) are activated after the drop in od600 , signifying the onset of sporulation .

expression of iphluorin from sporulation - specific promoters starts only after the drop in od600 .
figure 4 internal ph as measured with iphluorin expressed from different promoters .
the ph is calculated from when the 390 nm channel exceeded 1,000 units .
ph from the spore - specific promoters is calculated from approximately 17 h onward .
lines represent actual data from a representative example .
the phi of b. subtilis reaches its highest value of around 8 during exponential growth .
this value is in agreement with earlier reported values ranging from ph = 7.8 to 8.1 ( setlow and setlow , 1980 ; magill et al. , 1994 ) .
at the drop in od600 , cells either die or differentiate and initiate sporulation or remain in stationary phase .
this was accompanied by an apparent steep decrease in phi , to 7.0 in vegetative cells expressing iphluorin from pptsg .
likely , this at least partially is indicative for cell lysis as a strong fluorescent signal could also be detected in the medium after spinning down the cells .
additionally , it is possible that morphological changes of the cell affect their optical properties .
sporulating cells are , for instance , smaller than exponentially growing cells .
hence , after sporulation commences , the ph values observed with pptsg - iphluorin can no longer be considered an accurate estimate of the intracellular ph in vegetative cells .
apart from aberrant values due to cell lysis , the pptsg - driven iphluorin may also get trapped in sporulating cells so that the observed ph from pptsg - driven iphluorin is the average of sporulating and non - sporulating cells as well as the medium .
subsequently , the od600 rose again slowly and the apparent ph increased to 7.4 ( figure 3 ) .
we do not know from which cells this signal originates as it may represent the average of various differentiation types , all expressing iphluorin .
to deconvolute these signals , single cell measurements are needed .
sporulation - specific expression of iphluorin sporulation of b. subtilis is a well - described , carefully orchestrated process where a number of different sigma factors are activated during subsequent stages ( wang et al. , 2006 ) .
it has been reported that the phi of bacillus spores is lower than that of vegetative cells ( magill et al. , 1994 ) .
we set out to measure the ph in spores and at what stage in sporulation the drop in ph starts and when the ph would rise again during germination .
for this purpose , we constructed strains with early and late ( pre ) spore - specific expression of iphluorin .
we selected promoters that would be active in the pre - spore and mother cell at different times during sporulation to monitor phi of both cells separately .
expression from pspoiia , pspoiiid , and psspe starts after the drop in od600 .
the surviving cells may prepare for diauxic growth or sporulation ( veening et al. , 2008 ) .
this characteristic allowed us to measure differences in phi in both mother cell and pre - spore in the subpopulation that initiates sporulation .
expression levels from pspoiia , pspoiiid , and psspe are lower than of pptsg , but are still reliable and strong enough to allow ph monitoring ( figures 3a,b ) .
for the sporulation - specific promoters , a cut - off of 1,000 arbitrary units in the 390 to 510 nm fluorescence channel was used for phi calculations .
spoiia is activated by high levels of activated spo0a and its presence was shown to be a reliable indicator for cells that initiate sporulation ( veening et al. , 2005 ) .
indeed , a fluorescent signal of a gfp reporter under control of the spoiia promoter can be found in both mother cell and fore - spore ( our unpublished observations ; veening et al. , 2006b ) .
expression of genes in the mother cell regulated by pspoiiid follows that of those regulated by pspoiia , as expected , but because expression levels of pspoiiid - controlled iphluorin are higher , reliable phi measurements can be obtained earlier with the latter .
initially , the sporulating subpopulation had a phi that closely resembled the phi of exponentially growing cells measured with the pptsg - iphluorin strain .
the mother cell ( pspoiiid - iphluorin ) had a ph of 7.8 after 17 h of incubation .
iphluorin expressed from the spore - specific promoter psspe revealed ph values of 7.4 .
the mother cell - specific expression of iphluorin from the spoiiid promoter decreased after 25 h of culture .
at that time point and from then onward , an apparent decrease measured with the mother cell - specific promoter driving iphluorin expression was observed .
this data , however , may at least partially be influenced by mother cell lysis and release of iphluorin into the medium .
the inferred ph at 40 h of culture closely resembled medium ph , corroborating this notion .
the decrease in phi in the fore - spore ( psspe - iphluorin ) drops below the medium ph and its fluorescent signal can clearly be observed inside maturing spores ( figure 2h ) .
noticeably , spores have a very low water activity and optical properties dissimilar from vegetative cells , which may obscure the ph as defined as the number of free protons ( sunde et al. , 2009 ) .
our data indicates that at 17.5 h of culture , the phi of the fore - spore is 7.4 , as reported by psspe - iphluorin .
after 40 h , the ph value of 6.8 reported by psspe - iphluorin is approaching the reported value for bacillus spores ( phi = 6.0 +/ - 0.3 ; barton et al. , 1980 ; setlow and setlow , 1980 ; magill et al. , 1994 , 1996 ) .
likely , because at this time point the population is still a mix of some fore - spore - containing cells as well as many free spores , the observed ph is slightly higher than the reported values for isolated bacillus spores .
corroborating this , when we washed and isolated the spores our phluorin - based measurement of the phi of b. subtilis spores also indicated values around 6.0 +/ - 0.3 ( see , e.g. , phi data of time point 0 obtained with iphluorin driven by psspe in figure 5 and beyond ) .
figure 5 internal ph during spore germination and outgrowth .
iphluorin accumulated in the spores ( from expression controlled by psspe ) allows ph measurements from t = 0 to approximately 300 min .
expression of iphluorin from pptsg allows calculation of the phi from approximately 200 min .
data are from a representative example of germination and outgrowth of b. subtilis spores at an external ph of 6.4 .
internal ph during spore germination and outgrowth as described above , iphluorin expressed from psspe accumulates in mature spores .
germination and outgrowth were monitored used b. subtilis pb2 psspe - iphluorin and b. subtilis pb2 pptsg - iphluorin .
when germination is triggered by addition of a mixture of asparagine , glucose , fructose and potassium ( agfk ) , the od600 of the spore crop drops , because the refractile spores turn phase - dark , due to water uptake .
simultaneously , the spore 's phi rises .
depending on the medium ph , the phi rises to 7.0 - 7.4 ( figure 5 and our unpublished observations for germination at ph 7.4 , respectively ) .
in the case of germination at ph = 6.4 , this indicates the establishment of a ph gradient .
not all spores germinate at the same time , and significant heterogeneity can be observed in the timing of germination and outgrowth ( smelt et al. , 2008 ) .
since this is a mixed population , consisting of phase - bright and germinating spores , the actual ph change in individual germinating spores may differ .
during the lag phase between germination and outgrowth , the ptsg promoter is activated .
parallel expression of iphluorin from this promoter shows that the ph measured this way lies between 7.5 and 7.8 .
this range of ph values is maintained during exponential growth .
a generally observed slow decrease in ph may be due to acidification of the medium by acetic acid or co2 ( russell and diez - gonzalez , 1998 ; orij , 2010 ) .
after approximately 600 min , there is a sudden drop in ph and od600 as described above ( figure 5 ) .
germination with medium ph = 7.4 shows a more rapid decrease in od600 and an equally faster rise in phi .
also , when outgrowth commences , phi of these cells is higher , but follows a similar trend as with medium at ph = 6.4 .
internal ph during spore germination with weak acid stress dormant spores are highly resistant to antimicrobial treatment , but also metabolically inert ( brul and coote , 1999 ) .
when germination is triggered , the spore becomes more sensitive .
also , it has been observed that germination of bacillus spores can be inhibited by various preservatives ( cortezzo et al. , 2004 ; van melis et al. , 2011 ) .
when spores start to germinate , they release protons and the phi rises .
also , during this stage water is taken up and metabolism should be restarted .
these processes might be a target moment for woas to halt outgrowth of the germinating spore .
acetic and sorbic acid are amongst the most commonly used food preservatives ( stratford et al. , 2009 ; ter beek and brul , 2010 ; ullah et al. , 2012 ) .
while both woas have a similar pka value , sorbic acid is clearly the more potent antimicrobial compound .
we compared the effects of sorbic and acetic acid on germination and outgrowth by using concentrations of both acids that had a similar effect on growth rate ( ter beek , 2009 ) .
low concentrations of both acids reduced the exponential growth rate by approximately 50 % .
spores germinating in medium ( ph = 6.4 ) with 3 mm k - sorbate had a decreased rate of phi increase .
in controls the phi increase between the start of germination and t = 90 min was 1.4 units whilst with 3 mm k - sorbate this was 0.7 units .
at the onset of the exponential phase , the phi which gradually decreased from ph = 7.4 to 7.2 at t = 11 h ( figure 6a ) .
twenty - five millimolars of k - acetate allowed a rapid increase in phi during germination .
the phi during exponential growth remained stable at 7.2 during the experiment ( figure 7a ) .
figure 6 internal ph during spore germination and outgrowth .
iphluorin accumulated in the spores ( from expression controlled by psspe ) allows ph measurements from t = 0 to approximately 300 min .
expression of iphluorin from pptsg allows calculation of the phi from approximately 200 min .
data are from a representative example .
( a ) ge rmination and outgrowth of b. subtilis spores at an external ph = 6.4 with 3 mm ks .
( b ) germination and outgrowth of b. subtilis spores at an external ph = 6.4 with 10 mm ks. figure 7 internal ph during spore germination and outgrowth .
iphluorin accumulated in the spores ( from expression controlled by psspe ) allows ph measurements from t = 0 to approximately 300 min .
expression of iphluorin from pptsg allows calculation of the phi from approximately 200 min .
data are from a representative example .
( a ) germination and outgrowth of b. subtilis spores at an external ph = 6.4 with 25 mm kac .
( b ) germination and outgrowth of b. subtilis spores at an external ph = 6.4 with 80 mm kac .
high concentrations of woas were selected to reduce growth by 85 % .
pptsg - driven expression of iphluorin is delayed under these conditions , while spore - specific iphluorin can be observed for longer periods of time because the signal is not diluted out .
k - sorbate ( 10 mm ) is shown to delay the maximum drop in od600 indicative for spore germination .
the data in figure 6b show a drop from od600 0.13 to 0.08 in 216 min rather than from 0.13 to 0.07 in 84 min as was seen in the control shown in figure 5 .
the rise of the phi was here similarly delayed as was the case with 3 mm k - sorbate .
such effects were not seen with 80 mm k - acetate , although the reduction in growth rate is similar ( figure 7b ) .
to further confirm the observation that sorbic acid inhibited the development of a positive inside ph gradient , spores of b. subtilis pb2 psspe - iphluorin were incubated with identical concentrations of either sorbic or acetic acid in medium without glucose other than present as germinant .
when germination was triggered by addition of agfk , spores incubated with sorbic acid showed a clear concentration dependant reduction in od600 drop - rate as well as a reduced phi increase - rate .
the od drop - rate decreased from 80 x 10 - 3 to 40 x 10 - 3 od600 / min when 0.5 mm undissociated sorbic acid was present ( figure 8b ) .
such effects were not seen with acetic acid at identical concentrations , which behaved virtually identical to non - stressed germinating spores ( figures 8a,c ) .
these observations are in agreement with earlier reports stating that sorbic acid can specifically inhibit germination of b. cereus and b. subtilis , likely by interacting with germinant receptors ( cortezzo et al. , 2004 ; van melis et al. , 2011 ) .

discussion we show here that iphluorin is an accurate , versatile probe to investigate the phi of b. subtilis .
we were able to improve expression of phluorin by fusion of the first 24 bp of comga with the phluorin - encoding gene .
genomic integration of iphluorin resulted in more homogeneous expression levels compared to a multi - copy plasmid .
it also resulted in a more stable construct , not requiring antibiotics for maintenance of the iphluorin gene during extended periods of growth ( not shown ) .
the use of genomically integrated constructs with endogenous promoters for the expression of iphluorin resulted in a strong enough signal for accurate ph measurements during exponential growth on glucose as well as compartment - specific phi measurements during sporulation .
the iphluorin that accumulates in the spore under control of psspe allows phi measurements of the b. subtilis spore .
during spore germination and outgrowth , the signal from iphluorin , expressed from psspe overlaps slightly in time with pptsg - iphluorin expression , thus allowing continuous phi monitoring during germination and outgrowth in batch .
the ph values we have observed here closely resemble those found with other methods .
during exponential growth , the phi approaches ph = 8 .
the phi of b. subtilis spores was also found to lie at approximately ph = 6 .
despite the fact that expression levels of iphluorin are much lower in spores , the ph value observed again closely corresponds to earlier reported values .
the notion that during outgrowth a ph is observed that closely resembles the phi during exponential growth ( as observed with pptsg - iphluorin ) further corroborates the accuracy of our method .
other methods to measure phi generally involve compounds that are hydrophobic and have woa groups and may act as uncouplers , thereby depleting the deltaph and influencing deltapsi over the membrane .
they are also more labor - intensive when high temporal resolution is required and except for fluorescent dyes do not allow cell type - specific ph measurements .
however , these methods require long - term incubation with the dye plus extensive washing , taking up to 20 min to prepare the sample .
future studies will have to determine the phototoxicity and bleach rate of iphluorin in individual ( growing , sporulating , and germinating ) cells .
we have observed clear differences in phi between pptsg - iphluorin and sporulation - specific iphluorin .
it has been shown that within a growing population of b. subtilis cells , differentiation occurs ( veening et al. , 2006a , b ) and this may affect metabolic state and phi .
this heterogeneity cannot be clearly monitored in batch without the use of more specific promoters or single cell observations .
also during spore germination such heterogeneity is seen ( smelt et al. , 2008 ) , so our results show the average of a germinating population .
during spore germination , the phi increases due to release of protons ( swerdlow et al. , 1981 ) .
this process follows the drop in od600 , and results from h2o uptake and release of dpa .
our results show that a deltaph is established rapidly .
such an increased ph can reactivate pgm , thus allowing the utilization of the spore 's 3 - pga store ( magill et al. , 1994 ) .
taken together , our results show accurate , long - term phi monitoring in growing and sporulating b. subtilis cultures as well as during spore germination .
the phi of sporulating cells is as high as that of exponentially growing cells .
this is particularly the case for the mother cell .
the pre - spore phi drops to ph = 6.0 , however .
the pptsg - iphluorin strain can be used for many experiments where the phi needs to be measured in cells growing on glucose , without the need for additional inducers like iptg .
also , antibiotics are not strictly necessary .
the sporulation - specific iphluorin - expressing strains may give more insight in compartmentalization during sporulation , while the psspe - iphluorin strain may also help understanding spore germination characteristics in the presence of potential outgrowth inhibitors such as the woas sorbic acid and acetic acid .
clearly , because not all cells are in exactly the same state , these data represent the average value of the phi in the population studies .
to analyze the heterogeneity single - spore phi measurements are needed .
currently we are extending our single cell live imaging tool " sporetracker " ( pandey et al. , 2013 ) to that end .

possible limitations for this study were the retrospective design and few participants .
1. introduction low back pain ( lbp ) is a common health problem that imposes a considerable personal , community , and financial burden worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] .
a systematic review of population prevalence studies of lbp between 1966 and 1998 showed a point prevalence ranging from 12 to 33 % , 12 - month prevalence from 22 to 65 % , and a lifetime prevalence ranging from 11 to 84 % [ 3 ] .
a more recent review concluded that the number of people suffering from lbp is likely to increase substantially over the next decades due to an aging population [ 1 ] .
most people will probably suffer from lbp at least once in their lifetime and many possibly for more than one period [ 4 ] .
lbp is a symptom with different stages of impairment , disability , and chronicity [ 5 ] .
in general , the pathophysiology for lbp is unknown , but known causes are osteoarthritis , inflammation in joints or supporting tissue , and herniated disc or trauma [ 6 , 7 ] .
usually , lbp is caused by a self - limiting musculoskeletal disorder , which typically resolves itself within 8 - 12 weeks [ 8 ] .
episodes of lbp lasting less than three months ( approximately 90 % of cases ) are usually benign and do not need specific treatment [ 5 ] .
there are also milder episodes of lbp that last for only a few days , with musculoskeletal stiffness or diffuse back discomfort [ 9 ] .
lbp is considered to be a fluctuating condition as an episodic and cyclic disorder , recurrent in a large proportion of cases and persistent in some [ 10 , 11 ] .
a literature review by de vet et al .
[ 4 ] suggested defining an episode of lbp " as a period of pain in the lower back lasting for more than 24 hours , preceded and followed by a period of at least one month without low back pain. " physical and psychosocial factors at work and lifestyle and individual factors have been implicated in the onset of symptoms [ 12 , 13 ] , and a previous history of lbp has been shown to be a possible predictive cause of future back problems [ 13 , 14 ] .
studies have shown an association between lbp in adolescence and lbp in adulthood [ 14 - 19 ] .
since lbp is a fluctuating condition , the type of data collection method is of great importance in trying to identify and predict presence of pain , on a daily basis or over time , in the data collection .
the aim of this study was to investigate the association of pain in adolescence with lbp in adulthood in a cohort of mine workers .
in addition , the relation of lbp assessed with daily text messages and lbp over the previous 12 - month period was studied .
furthermore , the aim was to study the relationship between lbp assessed with text messages and previous one - month lbp intensity .
2. materials and methods data with information on pain in adolescence and lbp in adulthood was first collected through a questionnaire and a medical examination as part of a health examination in 2012 .
three and nine months after the health examination , self - reported daily ratings of lbp were collected by the use of text messages .
the daily pain ratings were assessed for 35 days in each period .
the study design was a mixed method with data collected retrospectively , cross - sectionally , and prospectively .
the study population were employees at a copper mine in the northern part of sweden .
153 of the total 374 ( 41 %) workers of various occupational groups within the mining industry agreed to take part in the study .
the majority of the participants were employed as truck drivers ( 30 %) , followed by the second and third largest occupational groups , loaders ( 22 %) and outdoor laborers ( 12 %) .
the participants were asked to answer a questionnaire for supplementary background data such as age , occupation , exposure to agents in their occupation , stress , and smoking habits .
data on pain in different body locations during the 12 months before the health examination was assessed with the following question : " have you experienced any discomfort ( pain , inconvenience ) in any of the following body regions the last 12 months : neck , shoulder , elbow , wrist / hand , upper back , lower back , hip , knee and foot / ankle ?" the possible responses were " yes " or " no. " the variable for the prevalence of participants who experienced discomfort in the lower back in the previous 12 months before the health examination was designated as a 12 - month prevalence of lbp .
data on the pain intensity during the previous month before the health examination in 2012 was assessed with the following request : " grade the intensity of any symptoms you have experienced in the past month in the following body regions. " the same anatomical sites were used as described above .
the response scale was none , mild , moderate , severe , and extreme .
the variable for the pain intensity in the lower back among the participants the previous month before the health examination was designated as one - month lbp intensity .
two physicians , specialists in occupational medicine , examined all participants and also interviewed them about earlier periods of back pain with the guidance of a structured form .
data used in this study came from the request : " grade the worst experience of pain from the following periods of time .
indicate where the pain was localized. " the participants were asked to respond on a scale of 0 - 10 where 0 indicated no pain and 10 indicated the worst pain imaginable .
the scale used to retrospectively grade the worst pain included on a time axis divided into preschool ( up to the age of 6 years ) , school ( 8 - 12 years of age ) , teenage years ( 14 - 18 years of age ) , and from 20 to 60 years of age on a two - year range axis .
the variables chosen to define adolescence were the value of the worst experienced pain from 14 to 18 years of age , hereby designated as teenage years , and the worst experienced pain at the age of 20 , hereby designated as 20 years .
all the 153 employees that participated in the health examination were invited to participate in the text messaging study , which is described in more detail elsewhere [ 9 ] .
no exclusion criteria were used .
a flowchart of the invited subjects , inclusion , and the individuals who chose not to continue taking part in the measurements is shown in figure 1 .
eventually , 121 employees participated in the first period of data collection , which started on february 11 , 2013 , and continued until march 17 , 2013 .
the second period started about six months later , september 9 , 2013 , and continued until october 13 , 2013 .
both data collection periods lasted for 35 days .
during the data collection periods , the participants received a daily text message with the question " how much pain have you had in your lower back during the last 24 hours on a scale from 0 to 10 ?
reply with a number. " they reply with a numerical rating scale where 0 is " no pain " and 10 is " the worst pain imaginable. " the text messages were sent every day 15 minutes before the participant 's daily shift ended .
answers received more than 24 hours after the question was sent were registered as missing [ 9 ]. of the 121 participants , 108 ( 65 males and 43 females ) fulfilled the second period of data collection .
reasons given for ending participation were vacation , not wanting to participate anymore , and end of employment .
there were no significant differences between participants and dropouts in terms of gender , age , or pain rating ( data not shown ) [ 9 ] .
the variable for pain in the lower back measured by text messaging was designated as text message ( tm ) first / second period .
descriptive statistics were used to present characteristics of the participants at the health examination .
for categorical data , relative risk with 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % ci ) was used to study the associations of pain in adolescence and lbp in adulthood .
the participants were stratified in two groups according to their reported occurrence of pain in adolescence .
the group categorized as " no pain " had indicated 0 on the pain scale , and those categorized as " suffering pain " had indicated 1 - 10 on the numerical pain rating scale .
the association between pain in adolescence with one - month lbp intensity , 12 - month prevalence of lbp , and the text message ratings of lbp was analyzed with variance analysis using anova .
in the analyses of a possible association between one - month lbp intensity and pain in adolescence the one - month lbp pain intensity was dichotomized in a " low " ( 1 and 2 ) and a " high " ( 3 - 5 ) pain intensity group .
the text message ratings of lbp were calculated as the mean value of lbp for the 35 - day measurement period , 3 and 6 months after the health examination .
when studying the association of one - month lbp intensity with text message ratings of lbp , the one - month lbp pain intensity was categorized into four groups : " none " ( 1 ) , " low " ( 2 ) , " moderate " ( 3 ) , and " high " ( 4 and 5 ) .
pain groups 4 and 5 were merged due to the low number of subjects in the two highest categories .
variance analysis using anova was used to study associations between pain in adolescence with the text message ratings of lbp and also a possible interaction between gender and pain in adolescence .
variance analysis using anova was also used to study the association between the 12 - month prevalence of lbp and the one - month lbp intensity with the text message ratings of lbp .
analyses were stratified by gender and by age .
the participants' ages were dichotomized by the mean age of the participants , which was 40 years into a group consisting of participants 20 - 40 years of age and a group > 40 years of age .
p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
all analyses were performed using spss version 23 ( ibm corp. , 2015 ) .
the regional ethical review board for medical research in umea , sweden , approved the study ( 2012 - 265 - 31m ) .
3. results participant characteristics at baseline of the first text messaging period are shown in table 1 .
the prevalence of pain among all participants during the teenage years was 55 % and at age 20 years it was 59 % .
it was more common among women and younger persons ( 20 - 40 years of age ) to report pain in adolescence although this was not statistically significant ( table 2 ) .
the mean lbp daily ratings by text messaging during study periods one and two are above one ( figure 2 ) .
participants who experienced pain during their teenage years had relative risk of 1.33 ( 95 % ci 1.03 - 1.73 ) of lbp during the 12 months' period preceding the health examination ; however , there were no associations with one - month lbp intensity or lbp assessed with text messages in either of the two periods .
analyses stratified by gender showed an association with lbp assessed with text messages for the second period among the male participants ( p = 0.034 ) ( table 3 ) .
anova of a possible interaction between gender and pain in teenage years at the second period showed a significant interaction ( p = 0.025 ) but not for the first study period ( p = 0.076 ) .
analyses defined by age divided into two age groups showed no statistically significant associations between back pain during the teenage years and lbp in the last 12 months , lbp intensity , or lbp as assessed by text messages ( data not shown ) .
when analyzing all participants as one group , irrespective of gender , no statistically significant associations were observed between pain at the age of 20 years and the 12 - month prevalence of lbp , lbp intensity , or lbp as assessed by text messages .
male workers who experienced pain at age 20 had a relative risk of 0.43 ( 95 % ci 0.20 - 0.93 ) for lbp intensity ( table 4 ) .
anova of a possible interaction between gender and pain in teenage years on lbp assessed with text messages at the first and second study period showed no significant interaction ( p = 0.384 and p = 0.113 , resp. ) .
the 12 - month prevalence of lbp , as well as the one - month lbp intensity , was associated with mean lbp assessed with the text message - responses in both periods. with increasing one - month lbp intensity , the mean lbp rating increased ( table 5 ) .
anova of a possible interaction between gender and lbp intensity on lbp assessed with text messages at the second study period showed a significant interaction ( p = 0.017 ) and no interaction for the first study period ( p = 0.332 ) .
the same interaction analysis of possible interaction between gender and the 12 - month prevalence of lbp on lbp assessed by text messages showed no statistical significant interaction in the first or second study period ( p = 0.312 and p = 0.353 , resp. ) .
4. discussion the aim of this study was to investigate the association of pain in adolescence with lbp in adulthood in a cohort of mine workers .
only the 12 - month prevalence of lbp among all participants and the intensity of lbp preceding the examination among males were associated with pain in adolescence .
in our data , pain in adolescence was not associated with the presence or intensity of present lbp .
a possible limitation in this study might be the study design and the method used to collect information on back pain from adolescence .
in previous studies that have shown associations , a longitudinal / prospective design has been used [ 15 - 19 ] .
harreby et al .
[ 15 ] found that 90 % of their study population , with history of lbp , had an increased 12 - month prevalence of lbp when answering the questionnaire at the follow - up after 25 years .
the study concluded that lbp might be influenced in many ways and that multiple risk factors seemed to be of importance .
hellsing and bryngelsson [ 18 ] found that lbp at age 18 significantly increased the risk of lbp at age 40 .
in our study , 74 % of the study population with a history of pain in adolescence and 50 % of the study population with no history of pain in adolescence had a 12 - month prevalence of lbp .
the 12 - month prevalence of lbp among those with pain in adolescence in our study was lower compared to harreby et al .
[ 15 ] , but we had a retrospective design that may limit the details of earlier recollection of pain .
the lack of significant associations in this study could also depend on low number of participants and therefore low statistical power .
earlier studies had many more participants ranging from 481 up to 6540 [ 14 - 19 ] .
this study found a prevalence of pain during teenage years ( 14 - 18 years ) of 55 % and at age 20 years a corresponding prevalence of 59 % .
hestbaek et al .
[ 19 ] had a prevalence of lbp age 16 - 19 of 40 % and at age 20 - 22 of 50 % .
lbp was defined as lbp for more than zero days of the past year .
the prevalence of pain in our study is higher than that in hestbaek et al .
[ 19 ] , but we asked for the worst pain in general and not specifically for back pain .
in the present study , the participants were asked to retrospectively report the occurrence of pain and rate its intensity .
the relation between pain and time used a time axis divided into preschool , school , teenage years , and from 20 to 60 years of age in a two - year range .
the mean age of the 121 participants was about 40 years , and almost half of the population studied were in the age category of 41 - 65 years ( table 1 ) .
a retrospective method , such as the one used , may result in imprecise data caused by the participant 's inability to remember early periods of pain ( i.e. , recall bias ) , for some up to decades before data collection .
as described by hestbaek et al .
[ 19 ] , a total of 35 % of their study population reporting lbp at baseline claimed never to have experienced lbp eight years later at follow - up. this recall bias might partly explain the results from the present study .
during the analyses we divided the participants into two groups : 20 - 40 years of age and > 40 years , to study whether the participants 20 - 40 years of age or those over 40 years of age ability to remember early periods of pain would be shown in the statistical analysis , but this did not significantly affect the results .
the lack of connection between pain in adolescence and lbp in adulthood might depend on several factors occurring from younger age to older age which affect the lbp , such as other back traumas later in life .
in this study the age distribution between males and females was different since the males were older than the females .
this has not been taken into account during the analysis .
this study used two different data variables to define adolescence , one representing 14 - 18 years of age ( teenage ) and the other the age of 20 years .
no mutual definition of adolescence / youth or pain prevalence has been observed in other studies investigating a possible association between back pain in adolescence and lbp in adulthood [ 15 , 18 - 20 ] .
the lack of mutual definition of adolescence / youth and pain prevalence between studies may explain difference in results .
if only using the results from the 12 - month prevalence of lbp and defining adolescence by using the category teenage years , that is , reducing the statistical variables in the analysis , the present study presented a result of a statistically significant association between pain in adolescence and lbp in adulthood ( table 3 ) .
when handling prospective data such as observations of pain , these are often collected and analyzed at a few points of time , such as at baseline and at follow - up. if the measured outcome such as lbp has a tendency to fluctuate , details of relapses and remissions might be hard to detect only by two occasions of measurement [ 21 ] .
it is then preferable to collect data on a daily basis .
collecting information on daily pain has often been conducted by diaries .
diaries make it possible to gather long - term information on the way individuals feel or spend their time on certain activities of relevance to a research project , for example , a change of symptoms over time or compliance with treatment [ 8 ] .
since the use of mobile phones is standard among people , an alternative method of data collection has become available in the form of text messages. by using this method , it has become possible to collect data on a monthly , weekly , daily , or even hourly basis [ 22 ] .
in this study , the response rates from the data collection were very high , which indicates that the participants found the method easy to reply to , although there were 13 participants who did not participate in the second measurement period .
end of employment and no interest in participating further were specified as reasons not to continue the measurements , which could indicate that the method was a burden to them [ 9 ] .
the present study shows high response rates which are consistent with similar studies that used text messaging for participants with lbp [ 10 , 21 ] .
the second aim of this study was to study the association between the 12 - month prevalence of lbp and a one - month lbp intensity rating before the health examination with self - reported daily ratings of lbp collected by text messages .
the 12 - month prevalence of lbp and one - month lbp intensity assessed at present were , as shown in table 5 , statistically significant associated with lbp assessed with the two measuring periods , for a total of 70 days , three months , and nine months subsequently .
for one - month lbp intensity , the mean lbp rated by text messaging increased with the lbp intensity in both the first and the second period of measurement .
there was also an interaction of gender and lbp intensity on lbp assessed by text messaging during the second study period .
the self - reported lbp by text messaging provided detailed information in a fluctuating condition among the study population , and , as the participants only had a predetermined and limited time to answer , the method might be considered less vulnerable to recall biases compared to other methods .
questionnaire surveys are not considered ideal for collecting frequent data , due to often poor response rates .
to improve response rates , several mailings are often needed , which will increase costs [ 21 ] .
the cost of using text messages as data collection method is very low compared with postal questionnaires and also promising in terms of minimal time consumption and minimal data handling , for both researchers and participants [ 22 ] .
this method of collecting data may be useful when measuring fluctuating conditions with considerable individual variation [ 10 , 21 , 22 ] .
in our study we recorded fluctuating pain over time but we could not find a suitable quantification other than the mean value to account for this fluctuation .
to our knowledge no cohort of workers has yet been followed in order to study a possible association between pain in adolescence and lbp in adulthood .
an earlier study has shown that using daily text messages to investigate the presence of lbp on a long - term basis is possible [ 9 ] .
previous published studies using text messages to study the prevalence of back pain have included individuals with known low back pain [ 10 , 21 - 23 ] .
thus , if studying the risk factors for lbp in a working population , it is important to ask about back pain episodes in the immediate past , that is , maybe last year , since this is a strong predictor of subsequent lbp .
however , it seems unnecessary to ask about pain in adolescence , since that is a measure most probably strongly influenced by recall bias .
5. conclusions no clear associations between retrospective information on self - reported pain in adolescence and lbp in adulthood were observed .
possible limitations for this study were its retrospective design and few participants .
the result of this study indicates that a prospective longitudinal method is the preferred method when investigating associations between pain in adolescence and lbp in adulthood , when a retrospective method may give imprecise data caused by recall bias .
the occurrence of lbp in the 12 - month period preceding the health examination and a high lbp intensity one month before the health examination was strongly associated with the mean lbp over the 35 days assessed by daily text messages three and nine months later .
in order to investigate a possible relation between pain in adolescence and lbp in adulthood , a prospective study should be used to ensure detailed information .

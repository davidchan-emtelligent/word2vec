during the past decade , monte carlo method has obtained wide applications in optical imaging to simulate photon transport process inside tissues .
however , this method has not been effectively extended to the simulation of free - space photon transport at present .
in this paper , a uniform framework for noncontact optical imaging is proposed based on monte carlo method , which consists of the simulation of photon transport both in tissues and in free space .
specifically , the simplification theory of lens system is utilized to model the camera lens equipped in the optical imaging system , and monte carlo method is employed to describe the energy transformation from the tissue surface to the ccd camera .
also , the focusing effect of camera lens is considered to establish the relationship of corresponding points between tissue surface and ccd camera .
furthermore , a parallel version of the framework is realized , making the simulation much more convenient and effective .
the feasibility of the uniform framework and the effectiveness of the parallel version are demonstrated with a cylindrical phantom based on real experimental results .
1. introduction as a gold standard of probabilistic statistics , monte carlo ( mc ) method has been widely applied in the simulation of various physical processes and used to achieve its statistical characteristic by sampling enormous random samples [ 1 ] .
among these applications , a stochastic model is firstly constructed , in which the expected value of a certain random variable or a random variable combination is equal to the physical quantity in the physical process ; and then the expected value is determined by averaging the multi - sample of the random variable .
since mc simulation was first introduced to the field of laser - tissue interactions by wilson and adam [ 2 ] , it has been applied widely in simulating photon transport in tissues and been improved a lot [ 3 - 7 ] .
furthermore , a software platform , a monte carlo model of steady - state light transport in multilayered tissues ( mcml ) , was firstly developed by wang 's group to model the photon transport in multi - layered tissues [ 8 ] .
although the platform is portable to multiple computer platforms and several simulation results can be obtained , it is limited in normally incident light beam , simple geometries , and external source .
to handle the aforementioned problems , tian 's group developed a new simulation platform , molecular optical simulation environment ( mose ) , to simulate photon transport process in complicated and irregular geometries with internal light sources [ 9 , 10 ] .
however , mc method has not been effectively extended to simulate the photon transport process in free space .
theoretically , the simulation of photon transport in free space is an awkward problem , which is different from the simulation of photon transport in tissues .
in free space , the complexity of the optical imaging system induces difficulties to the photon transport simulation .
the presence of camera lens further complicates the photon transport process in free - space .
therefore , accurate and effective free - space photon transport model and the development of a uniform framework for the simulation of noncontact optical imaging are demanded urgently .
in this paper , a mc - based free - space photon transport ( mc - fpt ) model is developed , where the focusing effect of camera lens is taken into account and the simplification theory is used to model the camera lens as a thin lens .
the mapping relationship of corresponding points between tissue surface and ccd camera is established using the focusing effect of the simplified thin lens .
furthermore , a uniform framework is constructed by incorporating the mc - fpt model into the mose platform , including the photon transport process from photon generation by light source to signal detection with a ccd camera .
a parallel version of the uniform framework is realized based on mpich which is a robust and flexible implementation and application of the message passing interface .
experiment using cylindrical phantom demonstrates the performance of the proposed model and further shows the potential of the parallel uniform framework for practical noncontact optical imaging applications .
2. methods 2.1 .
monte carlo method mc method is a probability and statistical theory - based computation method , which achieves the statistical characteristic of physical process by sampling enormous random samples .
it relies on random sampling of variables from well - defined probability distributions to compute the value of physical quantities .
using the mc method , a random statistical model should be constructed first , in which several random variables are defined and each corresponds to a physical quantity with predefined probability distribution , and then enough samples of the random variables are carried to achieve the simulation of the physical process reliably .
given a random variable u with probability density function p ( u ) defined in the interval ( a , b ) , arbitrary sample x of the random variable will produce a random number xi and satisfies ( 1 ) integralaxp ( u ) du = xi , where x is located in the interval ( a , b ) and xi is in ( 0,1 ) .
making use of ( 1 ) , we can first generate the random number xi by a pseudorandom number generator , and then sample the random u by solving ( 1 ) for x .
2.2 .
photon transport in tissues photon transport in tissues is a complicated process and involves several activities including photon absorption , scattering , internal reflection , and transmission .
to simulate photon transport process in tissues using mc method , the problems such as photon generation , photon movement , boundary effect , photon absorption , photon scattering , and photon termination should be concerned [ 9 ] .
in practical applications , photon is commonly replaced by photon package .
the power of each photon package is determined through dividing the total power of light source by the number of the photon package .
once a photon package is generated from the light source , it first moves a distance determined by the step size along its initial emitting direction , then it loses part of its power due to the absorption and change its movement direction , because of the scattering , before it moves to the next position .
this process is repeated until the photon package is totally absorbed ( marked as photon _ dead = 1 ) or transmited through the outer boundary ( marked as photon _ dead = 0 ) .
in addition , the internal and the outer boundary effects should be concerned in the simulation .
during the photon transport process , the crucial step is to determine the next interaction site or the step size of the photon package , which can be calculated using the following equation : ( 2 ) d = - ln zetamua + mus , where d is the step size of the photon package ; zeta is a uniform random number in the interval ( 0,1 ) ; mu a and mu s are the absorption and scattering coefficients , respectively .
for the statistical characteristics of mc method , more than 106 photon packages are required to guarantee the accuracy and randomness of the simulation results .
the more photon packages running in the simulation , the better the simulation results would be. therefore , 108 photon packages are used for all the simulations in this paper .
2.3 .
photon transport in free space 2.3.1 .
simplification of optical imaging system optical imaging system usually includes two inevitable parts , camera lens and ccd camera .
the camera lens is utilized to transform and restrict the light beam , and the ccd camera is used to register the light beam that is selected by the camera lens .
therefore , the simplification of optical imaging system is composed of the simplification of the camera lens and the modeling of the ccd camera .
the following section will present the simplification of the optical imaging system employed in the proposed mc - fpt model .
a camera lens in an ideal optical system is typically not a single - lens , but a combination of a lens system with finite thickness and several other physical counterparts , such as camera lens diaphragms .
thus , photon transport in such combination is extremely complicated and difficult to analyze .
gauss had postulated that this combination can be simply modeled as a gaussian thick lens by replacing it with two equivalent refracting surfaces [ 11 , 12 ] .
furthermore , gaussian thick lens can be equivalently reduced to a thin lens model based on geometric and photometric mapping [ 12 ] .
because the thin lens model exhibits several excellent features such as simplified structure and rectilinear propagation of light beam in the thin lens , the camera lens in the optical imaging system is approximate to the simplified thin - lens model , shown in figure 1 .
thus , the thin - lens - based lens law given by 1 / u + 1 / v = 1 / f can be employed to establish the corresponding relationship between the object and image point as follows : ( 3 ) rd = r + u + vcos alphas , where r is the coordinates of the object point at the tissue surface ; r d is the coordinates of the corresponding image point ; u is the distance between the object point and the thin lens ; v is the corresponding image distance determined by the lens law of the thin lens ; f is the focal length of the thin lens ; s represents the direction of the light beam that emits from tissue surface and passes though the axis center of the thin lens ; cos alpha is the cosine value of the angle between the direction s and optical axis .
for the irregularity of tissue surface , not all the object points at the tissue surface are exactly imaged at the ccd camera , as shown in figure 1 ( a ) .
considering the focusing effect of the thin lens , this contribution assumes that all the surface points are in the range of depth - of - field .
each point at the tissue surface corresponds to one point at the ccd camera .
as a result , image points , not at the ccd camera should be projected onto the camera .
two projection methods , including orthographic and perspective projection method , can be used to perform the projection process , as described in the inset of figure 1 ( a ) .
the trail a'c shows the orthographic projection process , and the trail a 'd presents the perspective projection .
because schulz had demonstrated that the perspective projection method could better improve image aberrations compared with the orthographic projection method [ 13 ] , the perspective projection method is employed in the proposed mc - fpt model .
on the basis of the aforementioned analysis , the ccd camera in the optical imaging system is modeled as a sigmoid panel detector to enhance the focusing effect - based , one - for - one mapping , as shown in figure 1 ( b ) .
thus , an image point r d on the sigmoid panel detector which might be the image point or the image facula center of the surface point r can be calculated by rewriting ( 3 ) as follows : ( 4 ) rd = r + u + v'cos alphas , where v ' is the distance from the image point r d to the thin lens .
2.3.2 .
monte carlo - based free - space photon transport model once the photon package reaches the outer boundary and no total reflection occurs , it would continue propagating in free space and the free - space photon transport model can be constructed using mc method .
for this purpose , an assumption should be made first , that is , the free space is defined as a specific tissue which is assigned specific optical properties : the absorption coefficient mu a = 0 , the scattering coefficient mu s = 0 , and the anisotropy factor g = 1 .
according to ( 2 ) , we obtain the step size of the photon package by the following formula : ( 5 ) d = - ln zetamua + mus = infinity .
equation ( 5 ) implies that the step size of the photon package approaches infinity when the photon package propagates in free space .
because the free space is assumed as a totally forward scatter , we can conclude that the photon package would continue propagating in its emitting direction until it hits an obstruction or is collected by the ccd camera .
in the subsequent section , two mapping relationships between the tissue surface and the ccd camera , including spatial position and photon flux , are constructed to describe the implementation of the proposed mc - fpt model .
( a ) mapping relationship of spatial position between tissue surface and ccd camera based on the aforementioned analysis , optical imaging system used in the imaging experiment can be equivalently modeled as a simple system , a combination of a simplified thin lens and a sigmoid panel detector .
the experimental setup for this simplified non - contact measurement in real experiments is shown in figure 2 .
here , a visibility factor is introduced to be used as a criterion for determining whether the mapping relationship of spatial position between the surface point and the corresponding image point is established .
in mathematics , the visibility factor is defined as ( 6 ) epsilon ( r,rd )= alpha ( r,rd ) beta ( r,omegaf ) , where epsilon ( r , r d ) is the visibility factor that consists of two parts , field visibility factor and system visibility factor ; alpha ( r , r d ) is the field visibility factor that discards the outgoing photon packages not imaged at the detection point r d and can be determined by ( 7 ) alpha ( r,rd )={ 1,if rd = r + u + v'cos alpha s,0,otherwise .
the system visibility factor is used to discard the outgoing photon packages that cannot reach the thin lens and defined as ( 8 ) beta ( r,omegaf )={ 1,if srintersectionomegaf != empty,0,if srintersectionomegaf = empty , where beta ( r , omega f ) is the system visibility factor ; omega f is a thin - lens space with the same diameter as the lens system and can be obtained in the imaging experiment .
the expression s r intersection omega f != empty can be interpreted that the outgoing photon packages can pass through the thin lens , as line 1 shown in figure 2 ; similarly , s rintersectionomega f = empty shows that the intersection point between the line and thin lens space is out of the range of the thin lens space , as line 2 and line 3 shown in figure 2 .
based on the aforementioned analysis , the mapping relationship of spatial position between the surface points and the corresponding image points can be established using ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) .
( b ) mapping relationship of photon flux between tissue surface and ccd camera because the optical imaging system is reduced to a simple combination of a simplified thin lens and a sigmoid panel detector , the focusing effect is utilized to establish the relationship between the corresponding points at the tissue surface and the sigmoid panel detector .
incorporating the aforementioned analysis of mc method , we can obtain the following formula : ( 9 ) p ( rd )= integralstau ( r,rd ; f ) epsilon ( r,rd ) p ( r ) ds , where r is the position of outgoing photon at the tissue surface ; r d is the corresponding image point or image facula center of the outgoing photon package at the sigmoid panel detector , which can be determined by ( 4 ) ; p ( r ) is the power of the outgoing photon package emitted from the outer boundary ; p ( r d ) is the power detected at point r d ; tau ( r , r d ; f ) is the energy - loss coefficient of the optical imaging system , which is dependent upon multifactors and can be measured in the experiment , including the transmittance of the optical system and the position of and the distance between the point r and r d , ; epsilon ( r , r d ) is the visibility factor and can be determined by ( 6 ) .
to sum up , the flux distribution at the ccd camera can be calculated directly by solving the formula shown in ( 9 ) .
the uniform implementation framework for the proposed mc - fpt model is presented in algorithm 1 .
2.4 .
parallel implementation in order to improve the simulation efficiency of the proposed uniform framework , a parallel version is developed based on a small - scale parallel system , which is realized on windows operating system .
the parallel system is constructed by several personal computers , and all the computers are connected to a 16 - port ethernet switch with the data transfer rate of 100 megabits per second .
in the simulation , one of the cpus is selected as master processor and the others are served as slaver processors .
the master processor is responsible for controlling the parallel program and simultaneously participating in computation , and the slavers are utilized for computation .
in addition , message passing mechanism is employed for the communications among the processors in the parallel framework , which is concretely implemented on mpich , a robust and flexible implementation and application of the message passing interface ( mpi ) .
pseudorandom generator is an important part of mc simulation , and the parallelization of the mc - based framework is to actually parallelize the pseudo - random generator .
because the master - slave mode communication is utilized in the proposed parallel framework , pseudo - random generator parallelization is realized by dividing cycle method [ 10 ] .
dividing cycle method is a common parallelization method to parallelize the pseudo - random generator and its implementation in the proposed parallel framework is described as follows .
firstly , a random number sequence is generated by the master processor and divided into several subdomains .
secondly , the first random number of each sub - domain is sent to the corresponding slaver processor as a seed .
finally , with the random number seeds , the slaver processors generate their own random number sequence .
the whole flowchart of the proposed parallel framework is shown in figure 3 , where the task assignment includes three steps : first , a random number sequence is generated by the master cpu ; second , the random number sequence is divided into n c sub - domains , and n c is the number of cpus ; third , the first random number of each sub - domain is sent to the corresponding slaver cpu .
in addition , it should be noted that a multiplicative congruent generator is employed in the proposed mc - based framework , and the parallel program is coded with the standard c ++ language .
3. experiments and results a nylon cylindrical phantom of 30 mm diameter and 30 mm height was designed to verify the performance of the proposed mc - based free - space photon transport model and its parallel uniform framework .
a small hole of 2 mm diameter and 16 mm depth from the top surface of the phantom was drilled with a distance of 8 mm from the center to emplace light source , as presented in literature [ 12 ] .
the light source was made of luminescent solution that was extracted from a red luminescent light stick ( glow products , canada ) .
because the central wavelength of luminescence light generated by the luminescent solution is about 650 nm , the optical properties of the phantom were measured at the wavelength about 660 nm by a time - correlated single photon counting ( tcspc ) system [ 14 ] .
the measured optical properties of the phantom are listed as follows : the absorption coefficient mu a = 0.0138 mm - 1 and the reduced scattering coefficient mu s' = 0.91 mm - 1 .
a cooled back - illuminated ccd camera ( princeton instrument / acton 2048b ) coupled with a nikkor mrico 55 mm f / 2.8 camera lens was utilized to collect the emitted photons .
in the experiment , the aperture value of the camera lens was set at f / 8 to ensure that the front surface of the phantom was in the range of depth - of - field .
the experimental setup is shown in figure 4 .
figure 4 ( a ) shows the physical phantom used in the optical imaging experiment , figure 4 ( b ) describes four perspectives for the optical imaging system to register the outgoing luminescence light , and figure 4 ( c ) presents the numerical phantom utilized in the simulation framework .
3.1 .
experiment verifications in this subsection , an optical imaging experiment is performed to validate the performance of the proposed mc framework using the aforementioned optical imaging system and experimental setup .
four perspective images ; front , left , back , and right perspectives , are presented in figure 5 .
figures 5 ( a ) - 5 ( d ) present the measured flux captured by the ccd camera in the imaging experiment , and figures 5 ( e ) - 5 ( h ) show the simulated flux of the proposed mc framework .
although similar tendency on flux distribution is achieved , there are still some flaws .
firstly , the simulated flux distribution is a little larger than the measured one , which is mainly caused by the simplification of optical imaging system and could be improved by more accurately modeling the optical imaging system .
secondly , the simulated flux is sparser than the measured one , which is intrinsically caused by the stochastic characteristic of mc method .
much smoother simulated flux can be obtained by increasing the number of photon package in the simulation .
results of detector z positions : z d = 0.0 , 2.0 , and 4.0 mm are examined and shown in figure 6 .
figures 6 ( a ) - 6 ( d ) describe the comparison results between the proposed mc framework and real experiment .
the solid lines show the results from real experiment , and the asterisks represent the simulated results of the proposed mc framework .
although the simulated flux seems a bit sparse , the mean error ( me ) and root - mean - square error ( rmse ) defined in literature [ 12 ] show the conformability from the aspect of quantitative error analysis , as listed in table 1 .
good agreement is observed in the cases examined , with the average me and rmse being about 0.0300 and 0.0015 .
because the accuracy of the transmitted photon flux on the phantom surface simulated by mose has been sufficiently demonstrated [ 9 , 10 ] , the proposed mc framework works well in simulating photon transport in free space and provides great potential for non - contact optical imaging .
3.2 .
parallel performance demonstration ideally , parallel execution on an increased number of cpus should provide improved simulation performance .
in order to evaluate the parallel uniform framework , performance demonstration experiment is performed using different number of cpus .
the experiment is performed on a workstation with two eight - core xeon cpus and 8 gb ram .
figure 7 shows the variation of the simulation time with the cpu number .
the total simulation time decreases with the increase of cpu number .
moreover , the downtrend of the simulation time tends to be steady when the number of cpus increased to a certain value , 8 in this experiment .
to further observe the improved performance on the simulation time , the factor of speedup ratio with respect to serial framework is calculated , as listed in table 2 .
it also shows that the simulation time decreases to a relative stable value with the increase of cpu number .
since the simulation is performed on a group of cpus , the communication time among the cpus becomes significant with the increase of cpu number .
as a result , the simulation time would less decrease when the number of cpus reaches a certain value , as shown in figure 7 and table 2 .
higher speed communication method can significantly reduce the simulation time cost. with the available hardware and software conditions , the number of cpus must be predetermined to achieve a compromise between the simulation speed and the resources .
4. discussions and conclusion in this paper , a statistical free space photon transport model is developed based on monte carlo method .
it employs the simplification theory of the camera lens to simplify the optical imaging system and utilizes monte carlo method to describe the photon transport process in free space .
moreover , the focusing effect of the thin lens is introduced to depict the mapping relationship between the corresponding points at the tissue surface and ccd camera .
incorporating with photon transport simulation in tissues , we constructed a monte - carlo - based uniform framework for the forward problem of the non - contact optical imaging .
specially , a parallel version of the uniform framework was realized to improve the performance on speed .
comparisons with real experiment have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of the proposed uniform framework .
the proposed model can still be improved in the following aspects .
firstly , more accurate simplification model of optical imaging system can be constructed to improve the distribution of simulated photon flux , such as the consideration of the physical counterparts in the camera lens .
secondly , this paper just presents the qualitative study of photon transport in free space based on monte carlo method .
quantitative study can be realized by anther post processing method , such as the calibration of the ccd camera .
lastly , the proposed model is time consuming due to the statistical characteristic of monte carlo method .
although a parallel framework is realized to speedup the simulation , the parallel strategy is not perfect .
higher speed communication method or graphics processing unit ( gpu ) technique based on parallel strategy can be employed to better improve the simulation efficiency of the proposed model .
our future work will concentrate on the more accurate simplification model of the camera lens , the quantitative study of the proposed model , and the gpu technique based on acceleration .
the corresponding results will be reported later .

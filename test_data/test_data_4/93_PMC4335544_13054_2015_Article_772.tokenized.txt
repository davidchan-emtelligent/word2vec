introduction as a result of drug sequestration and increased volume of distribution , the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) procedure might lead to a decrease in drug concentrations during a patient 's treatment .
the aim of this study was to evaluate sedative , antibiotic and immunosuppressive drug loss in ecmo circuit using ex - vivo and in - vitro experiments .
methods blood concentrations of propofol , midazolam , cyclosporine and vancomycin were measured in an ex - vivo ecmo circuit primed with whole human blood , and compared to controls stored in polypropylene tubes .
in vitro experiments were also conducted to further explore the role of temperature , oxygen exposure and polyvinylchloride surfaces on propofol loss in the ecmo circuit .
results propofol concentration decreased rapidly ; 70 % of its baseline concentration was lost after only 30 minutes , and only 11 % remained after five hours ( p < 0.001 for the comparison with control polypropylene tube propofol concentration ) .
further experiments demonstrated that oxygen exposure and contact with polyvinylchloride tubing were respectively responsible for 70 % and 85 % of propofol loss after 45 minutes .
midazolam concentration also rapidly decreased in the ecmo circuit , with only 54 % and 11 % of baseline concentration being detected at 30 minutes and 24 hours respectively ( p = 0.01 versus control ) .
alternatively , cyclosporine concentration remained stable for the five first hours , then decreased to 78 % and 73 % of the baseline value after 24 hours and 48 hours , ( p = 0.35 versus control ) .
lastly , vancomycin concentration remained stable in the ecmo circuit for the 48 - hour experimental protocol .
conclusions we observed important losses of propofol and midazolam , while cyclosporine concentration decreased slowly and moderately , and vancomycin concentration remained unchanged in the ex - vivo ecmo circuit primed with whole human blood .
these data might help intensive care unit physicians planning clinical trials with a final objective to better adapt doses of these drugs while treating critically ill ecmo patients .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 introduction extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) is a complex life - support technique used to rescue critically ill patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure [ 1 ] .
modern ecmo circuits consist of polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) tubing , a polymethylpentene membrane oxygenator and a centrifugal pump [ 2 ] .
patients on ecmo require multiple medications including sedatives , analgesics , antibiotics and sometimes immunosuppressive drugs [ 3,4 ] .
pharmacokinetics of drugs administered during ecmo is complex notably due to a larger volume of distribution in ecmo - treated patients and also to the adsorption of drugs on the pvc tubing and / or the membrane oxygenator leading to an increase in drug clearance [ 2,5 ] .
the degree of drug uptake by the circuit depends on the physicochemical characteristics of the drugs [ 6 ] .
for example , compounds with a high octanol / water partition ( log p ) will be very soluble in organic materials and may exhibit considerable loss in the ecmo circuit [ 6 ] .
conversely , the pharmacokinetics of hydrophilic drugs have been reported to be unaffected by the ecmo procedure [ 7,8 ] .
drug adsorption on the circuit may also depend on circuit duration of use , since binding sites may become saturated after a few hours of operation [ 3,9 ] .
to date , very limited data on the pharmacokinetics of drugs in patients supported by ecmo are available .
the objective of the present study was , therefore , to determine , in an ex vivo ecmo circuit primed with human whole blood , changes in the concentrations of propofol , midazolam , vancomycin and cyclosporine , which are frequently prescribed to ecmo patients .
methods drug sequestration in an ex vivo ecmo circuit primed with human whole blood this study was an experimental study and did not include any patients .
thus , it needed no ethical approval and no patient consent was needed .
whole ecmo circuits ( maquet ( r ) , orleans , france ) comprising a quadrox ( r ) membrane oxygenator , a centrifugal pump , a heat exchanger and pvc tubing were used for ex vivo tests .
all components of the circuit were treated with heparin ( bioline coating ( r ) , maquet ) .
drug - free human whole blood ( 800 ml ) was used to prime the circuit .
in order to replicate the in vivo operating conditions , the temperature of the circulating blood was set at 37degreesc and circuit flow rate at 4.5 l / minute .
propofol ( diprivan ( r ) 10 mg / ml , fresenius , france ) , midazolam ( hypnovel 1 mg / ml , roche , france ) , vancomycin ( vancomycine ( r ) 50 mg / ml , sandoz , france ) , and cyclosporine ( sandimmun ( r ) 50 mg / ml , novartis , france ) were introduced into the circuit to achieve final concentrations of 2 mug / ml , 30 mug / ml , 500 ng / ml and 1.2 mug / ml , respectively .
octanol / water partition coefficients of the drugs are provided in table 1 .
a high partition coefficient is associated with a high solubility in organic materials .
human blood was provided by the etablissement francais du sang ( efs ) ( rungis , france ) .
table 1 octanol / water partition coefficients of propofol , midazolam , cyclosporine and vancomycin drug partition coefficient ( log p ) vancomycin - 3.1 cyclosporine 2.9 midazolam 3.9 propofol 4.0 during ex vivo ecmo runs , serial post - membrane blood samples were obtained at 30 minutes , 1 hour , 2 hours , 3 hours , 4 hours , 5 hours , 24 hours and 48 hours after drug introduction into the circuit .
until analysis , samples were kept at 4degreesc and plasma separated and frozen at - 20degreesc .
to determine spontaneous drug degradation , blood containing identical concentrations of the drugs studied was kept in polypropylene tubes under agitation at 25degreesc for the same time before measurements .
propofol and midazolam concentrations were measured using high performance liquid chromatography with an ultra - violet detector ( waters , milford , ma , usa ) .
vancomycin and cyclosporine concentrations were measured using an immuno - enzymatic method on a dimension ( r ) system ( siemens , munich , germany ) .
the operating conditions ( oxygen flow , blood flow , circuit temperature ) remained stable during the 48 hours of each experiment which were repeated three times with three different ecmo circuits .
impact of temperature , oxygen and polyvinylchloride surfaces on propofol concentrations in vitro to further explore the role of temperature , oxygen exposure and pvc surfaces on propofol loss in the ecmo circuit , the following experiments were conducted .
a polypropylene tube containing human whole blood was spiked with the propofol stock solution to obtain a concentration of 2 mug / l. the effect of the temperature , oxygen exposure and contact with pvc surfaces were assessed by incubating the tube at 37degreesc , applying oxygen ( 1 l / minute ) for 10 seconds to the preparation and by distributing the preparation into 5 - cm pvc tubes , respectively .
polypropylene tubes containing blood and propofol at the same concentration were stored at room temperature and were used as controls .
propofol concentrations were measured at 0 minutes , 5 minutes , 10 minutes , 15 minutes , 20 minutes , 25 minutes , 30 minutes and 45 minutes from each preparation .
these experiments were conducted in triplicate .
statistical analyses changes of mean drug concentrations over time were compared between control and experimental conditions by modeling using a linear mixed effect model .
this model accounts for the repeated responses from the same experiments by using a random effect on intercept solely ( propofol and vancomycin ) and using a random effects on intercept and time ( midazolam and cyclosporine ) .
model choice was guided by the lowest akaike criteria value .
the mixed effect model was then fitted with r software version 3.0.2 and the ' nlme ' library [ 10 ] .
results changes in drug concentrations in ex vivo circuits primed with whole human blood propofol , midazolam , cyclosporine and vancomycin concentrations remained stable over time in control polypropylene tubes .
alternatively , propofol concentration decreased rapidly in the ecmo circuit , 70 % of its baseline concentration being lost only 30 minutes after introduction of the drug into the circuit ( figure 1 ) .
after 5 hours , only 11 % of the initial propofol concentration remained and the fraction remaining beyond 24 hours was negligible .
differences between experiment and control polypropylene tube propofol concentrations were statistically significant ( p = 0.0006 ) .
midazolam concentration also decreased rapidly in ecmo circuits ( figure 2 ) , with only 54 % and 11 % of baseline concentrations being detected at 30 minutes and 24 hours , respectively ( p = 0.01 versus polypropylene control ) .
the cyclosporine concentration remained stable in the circuit for the first 5 hours , then decreased to 78 % and 73 % of the baseline value after 24 hours and 48 hours , respectively ( p = 0.35 versus polypropylene control ) ( figure 3 ) .
in contrast , vancomycin concentration remained stable in the ecmo circuit during the 48 hours of the experimental protocol ( p = 0.86 ) ( figure 4 ) .

impact of temperature , oxygen and pvc surfaces on propofol concentration in vitro oxygen exposure and contact with pvc tubing resulted in 70 % and 85 % loss of propofol after 45 minutes , respectively .

discussion this study showed important losses of propofol and midazolam in ex vivo ecmo circuits primed with whole human blood , while cyclosporine concentration decreased slowly and moderately and vancomycin concentration remained unchanged .
furthermore , we demonstrated that oxygen exposure and contact with pvc tubing were major factors leading to propofol degradation in ecmo circuits .
patients on ecmo frequently receive many drugs , such as sedatives and analgesics , antibiotics or immunosuppressants .
inadequate blood concentration of these drugs might lead to treatment failure or toxicity , underlining the need for better knowledge of the complex pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in this particular setting [ 11,12 ] .
indeed , drug concentrations in critically ill ecmo patients might be altered by an increase in drug volume of distribution or alteration in drug elimination .
drugs might also be adsorbed in the ecmo circuit , with greater loss being reported for more lipophilic and higher octanol / water partition coefficient drugs ( table 1 ) [ 6,13 - 16 ] .
consistent with previous reports [ 1,17 ] , we observed a rapid and major decrease in propofol concentration in our experiments .
although its lipophilic properties might be associated with substantial loss due to adsorption on circuit components , our results suggested that oxidation might also be an important determinant of propofol degradation .
indeed , propofol is a reducing agent which can be oxidized in the presence of an electron acceptor [ 18 ] .
the decrease in midazolam concentration was rapid and only 25 % of the initial concentration remained in the circuit after 24 hours .
this observation is also consistent with previously reported in vitro and ex vivo data on midazolam concentration evolution in ecmo circuits , with the decrease reaching 68 % to 87 % after 24 hours [ 1,6,19 ] .
inadequate concentrations of antibacterial agents can lead to treatment failure that might compromise the outcomes of critically ill patients .
vancomycin , which is the drug of choice for treating beta - lactam resistant gram - positive bacteria , is frequently prescribed to ecmo patients .
data on vancomycin concentrations reported in ecmo are controversial .
in agreement with our observation , mehta et al .
[ 20 ] and shekar et al .
[ 19 ] , using ex vivo models , found that vancomycin levels remained unchanged in the circuit for 24 hours .
conversely , dagan et al. observed that vancomycin concentrations decreased by 36 % when the drug was introduced in a new circuit while it decreased by only 11 % when introduced in a circuit which had been running for five days [ 3 ] .
saturation of adsorption sites was suggested by these authors [ 3 ] .
similarly , wildschut et al. also reported a decrease in vancomycin concentration ( up to 46 %) in a study conducted with neonatal and pediatric circuits [ 6 ] .
these observations suggest that more data are needed to better determine changes in drug concentrations of vancomycin in an ecmo circuit .
immunosuppressive agents , such as cyclosporine , are defined by a narrow therapeutic window and low serum concentrations of these drugs might lead to acute graft rejection .
although a previous study suggested in vitro adsorption studies of cyclosporine on pvc infusion sets significantly higher than that in those made of polyethylene or polybutadiene [ 21 ] , this study is the first to evaluate cyclosporine pharmacokinetics in ecmo patients .
our results suggested that cyclosporine concentration decreases slowly in the ecmo circuit with 66 % of the initial concentration remaining in the circuit after 48 hours .
this decrease might be attributed in part to adsorption on the ecmo circuit component , given its high partition coefficient ( log p = 2.92 ) .
conclusions we reported herein on propofol , midazolam , vancomycin and cyclosporine concentration profiles in ex vivo whole - blood primed ecmo circuits .
our observations showed important losses of propofol and midazolam , while cyclosporine concentration decreased slowly and moderately and vancomycin concentration remained unchanged .
these data might help intensive care unit physicians better adapt doses of these drugs while treating critically ill ecmo patients .
further studies should focus on the in vivo pharmacokinetics of drugs during ecmo .
key messages this paper confirmed important loss of lipophilic drugs within ecmo circuits .
it also highlighted the role of oxidation as an influencing factor of ex vivo stability of reducing drugs .
drug properties should be taken into account for therapeutic strategy in ecmo patients .

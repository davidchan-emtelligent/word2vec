background suicide is an urgent public health challenge for china .
this study aims to examine the prevalence , influence factors , and gender differences of suicidal ideation among general population in northwestern urban china .
methods data used in this study were derived from the third wave of a cohort study of a randomized community sample with 4291 participants (>= 20 years ) in 2008 in lanzhou city and baiyin city , gansu province .
data were collected via face - to - face interview by the trained interviewers .
descriptive analyses , chi - square tests and multivariate logistic regressions were performed by using stata 12.0 , as needed .
results the prevalence of 12 - month suicidal ideation was 4.29 % , there was no significant difference between males and females [ 5.04 % vs 3.62 % , adjusted odds ratio ( aor ) = 0.83 , p = 0.351 ] .
several risk factors for suicidal ideation were confirmed , including being unmarried ( aor = 1.55 , p = 0.030 ) , having depression symptoms ( aor = 2.33 , p < 0.001 ) , having other insurance ( aor = 1.83 , p = 0.01 ) or no insurance ( aor = 1.73 , p = 0.024 ) .
in addition , several influence factors were significantly different in males and females , such as being currently married ( unmarried vs married , aor = 1.84 , p = 0.027 , for females ; no difference for males ) , feeling hopeless ( hopless vs hopeful , aor = 1.92 , p = 0.06 , for females ; no difference for males ) , having other insurances ( having other insurances vs having basic employee medical insurance , aor = 1.92 , p = 0.044 , for males ; no difference for females ) , having debts ( having debts vs no debts , aor = 2.69 , p = 0.001 , for males ; no difference for females ) , currently smoking ( smoking vs nonsmoking , aor = 3.01 , p = 0.019 for females , no difference for males ) , and currently drinking ( drinking vs nondrinking , aor = 2.01 , p = 0.022 , for males ; no difference for females ) .
discussion and conclusion these findings suggested that comprehensive suicide prevention strategies should be developed or strengthened in order to prevent suicide ideation in china , and the gender - specific differences need to be explored through further researches .
keywords suicidal ideation ces - d gender differences undeveloped urban districts northwestern china issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background suicide is an urgent public health challenge which has received the increasing attention in china and worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] .
world health organization ( who ) estimated that there were about 1 million people died by suicide , which accounted for 1.3 % of the total global burden of disease in 2004 [ 3 ] .
in china , suicide was the fifth leading cause of death in china and contributed to 42 % of all suicide worldwide and 56 % of the world 's female suicide [ 4 ] .
it is worth noting that there are several specific characteristics of suicide in china , including high suicide rate among females [ 4 , 5 ] , high rural suicide rate [ 5 , 6 ] , pesticides poisoning being regarded as a major suicide method [ 2 , 7 ] , and low - planned suicides [ 8 ] .
in china , higher employment rates and better educational opportunities from recent economic developments may have contributed to the decrease of overall suicide rate [ 9 ] .
previous studies showed that the suicide rate had dropped from 22.9 to 15.4 per 100,000 during the period of 1991 - 2000 [ 10 ] and further decreased to 5.28 per 100,000 ( 5.78 and 4.77 for urban males and urban females respectively ; 9.95 and 8.58 for rural males and rural females respectively ) in 2011 [ 11 , 12 ] .
however , suicide rates among young males and rural older adults increased recently [ 12 - 14 ] .
taking the 1.4 billion population of china into consideration , the burden of suicide is extremely high [ 15 ] .
therefore , suicide is still a major public health challenge in china [ 3 ] , and more attention should be paid to suicide prevention in the future .
to prevent suicide in advance , suicidal ideation , defined as the wishes to be dead or thoughts of killing oneself , has been introduced by some researchers [ 16 , 17 ] .
suicidal ideation , which involves a hierarchy of feelings from the thought of " life is not worth living " to more serious articulation of a thought - out plan , is important because most suicides and parasuicides have engaged in suicidal thoughts prior to their acts [ 18 , 19 ] .
meanwhile , suicidal ideation is clinically important because it enables the measurement of intent [ 18 ] .
a previous study had confirmed the importance of suicidal ideation and further suggested that continued efforts should be outreached to the untreated individuals with suicidal ideation before the occurrence of attempts [ 20 ] .
hence , a deeper understanding of suicidal ideation will be beneficial in the suicide intervention and prevention .
previous studies have investigated the prevalence of lifetime , 24 - month , and 12 - month suicidal ideation in china .
the lifetime prevalence was 28.1 % among adults aged 20 - 59 years in hong kong ( east coast ) [ 21 ] , 18.5 % in the rural areas of yuncheng city , shanxi province ( north china ) [ 22 ] , and 18.8 % in the rural areas of mianyang city , sichuan province ( southwest china ) [ 23 ] .
the prevalence of 24 - month suicidal ideation was 2.12 % among the rural residents in zhejiang province ( east china ) [ 24 ] .
it was also found that prevalence of suicidal ideation in a 12 - month period was 6.7 % in hong kong [ 25 ] , 5.2 % among rural residents aged 16 - 34 years [ 23 ] and 8.8 % in rural older adults [ 26 ] in mianyang city , and 17.25 % among adolescents in guangzhou ( south china ) [ 27 ] .
in addition , a few of influencing factors have been found to be independently associated with suicidal ideation , including depressive symptoms [ 28 , 29 ] , the severity of depressed mood [ 30 ] , decrease in income [ 29 ] , unemployment [ 31 , 32 ] , traumatic life events [ 28 ] , age , marriage and concern by others [ 30 ] , the balance between life events and social support [ 30 ] , and a history of adverse childhood experiences [ 33 ] .
among the general population of china , the following risk factors for suicide ideation have also been screened out : being female [ 23 , 25 , 34 ] , being elderly [ 35 ] , being unmarried [ 23 , 25 ] , mood disorders [ 21 , 36 ] , being physically unhealthy [ 37 ] , having debts [ 38 ] , feeling helplessness [ 21 , 25 ] , drinking [ 27 , 34 ] , and smoking [ 25 ] .
apart from above , some studies found a positive association between body mass index ( bmi ) and suicidal ideation [ 39 ] , however the results were not consistent [ 40 - 43 ] .
therefore , the potential mechanism of the obesity - suicidal ideation association remains unclear .
in china , existing studies outlined above were mainly conducted in four developed urban areas ( beijing , shanghai , guangzhou , and hong kong ) , and three rural districts ( yuncheng , mianyang and zhejiang ) .
however there is no study on the prevalence or influence factors of suicidal ideation conducted in undeveloped urban areas , especially in western china .
furthermore , although gender differences in the suicide [ 44 , 45 ] and suicide attempts [ 46 - 48 ] have been confirmed , the gender - specific influence factors for suicidal ideation have not been examined in general population , with the exception of a study on adolescents in guangzhou [ 27 ] .
to fill these gaps in the current research , a population - based study in western urban china was conducted to investigate the prevalence and influence factors of suicidal ideation , and to examine the gender - specific influence factors of suicidal ideation .
methods sampling the data used in this study were derived from the third wave of the chinese urban social protection survey [ 49 - 51 ] , a cohort study of a randomized community sample in lanzhou city and baiying city of gansu province ( northwestern china ) , with the cooperation of the civil affairs department of gansu province ( northwestern china ) .
the baseline survey was completed in 2005 , and subsequently two follow - up rounds of data collection were conducted in april 2006 and january 2008 , respectively .
this study was approved by the committee of ethics of school of social development and public policy ( ssdpp ) at beijing normal university .
gansu province is a typical low - income region in western china .
in 2012 , the per capita disposable income of urban and rural residents was 17,237 rmb and 4,495 rmb respectively , both of which ranked in the bottom of the 31 provinces [ 52 ] .
lanzhou city , the capital of gansu province , is home to a population of 2,063,800 , with a per capita disposable income of 18,442 rmb in 2012 [ 53 ] .
baiying city , which is 60 km away from lanzhou , has a population of 714,200 , with a per capita disposable income of 18,532 rmb in 2012 [ 54 ] .
in urban china , there is a four - tier administrative system , including provinces , cities , counties / districts , towns / sub - districts , and communities [ 23 ] .
based on the administrative system , a three - stage cluster sampling process was employed , which was showed in fig. 1. in the first two stages , the " probability proportional to size " ( pps ) sampling method was used to select districts and communities based on their population size , and the detailed information can be found in our published articles [ 49 , 50 , 55 ] .
during the third stage , 100 households were set to be the equivalent of one sampling unit ; the final number of households included in the sample was determined according to the number of sampling units in each community [ 49 ] .
thus , using simple random sampling , the final sample includes a range of 100 to 300 households from each selected community .
a total of 4,661 households from 32 communities throughout the two cities were eventually selected .
in each household , one representative , who aged 20 years and over and was familiar with the familial situation , was responsible for the household survey and received the psychological assessments .
all contacted family members provided the information about the social - demographic characteristics , medical service utilization , social protection , and employment status .
as a result , the surveyed households and household respondents totaled 4,661 and 13,051 , respectively. of them , 4,291 household representatives , who successfully completed the psychological assessments , were involved in this study , yielding a response rate of 92.1 % .
for the remaining household representatives , 201 people refused to participate in this study , 60 people could not been reached for more than three times , and the reminding 109 questionnaires were discarded because of the bad quality. fig. 1 the sampling map in this study interviewer training , quality control and interview setting the survey was completed via face - to - face interviews by the trained interviewers .
50 graduate students , with a major in psychology , sociology or social policy , were selected as the interviewers from northwest normal university ( nnu ) , lanzhou city .
all the interviewers participated in a 7 - day systematic training at nnu , which was taught by experienced researchers from the school of social development and public policy ( ssdpp ) of beijing normal university ( bnu ) .
after finishing the training , interviewers were supposed to acquire following knowledge : ( 1 ) the purpose of the survey , ( 2 ) the standard interviewing protocol and techniques , and ( 3 ) the explanations of the items in the questionnaire .
finally , 40 qualified interviewers were recruited after a face - to - face assessment .
to ensure the quality of survey , a guideline for investigation , which covered detailed information about the research objective , question definitions , and a step - by - step interviewing protocol , was sent to each interviewer .
furthermore , prior to the interview , a letter was delivered to each selected family to inform them of the purpose of the survey and their right to refuse it. prior to the start of interview , an inform consent document was signed once the respondent agreed to join the survey .
the whole interview took about 30 to 60 minutes , which depended on the family size and the understanding capacity of the respondents .
the entire survey took 12 days in january 2008 .
in addition , a quality control group that included five experienced researchers from ssdpp were responsible for monitoring the process of interview , and checking the questionnaires at the end of each working - day .
the repeated interview was conducted through the telephone when over 30 % of data were missed in a questionnaire .
eventually , 120 questionnaires were completed by the supplementing interviews .
measures the major questions about the variables used in this study are described in table 1 .
participants were asked the following question about general suicidal ideation : " during the past 12 months , have you ever considered suicide ? ?
( yes / no ) [ 23 , 56 ] .
depression status in this study was measured using the 20 - item center for epidemiologic studies depression scale ( ces - d ) chinese version [ 57 ] , with a score of 21 serving as the cut - off point for moderate to severe depression status [ 58 , 59 ] , and the cronbach 's alpha of 0.87 for 20 items .
the data processing methods has been explicated in our previous articles [ 49 , 50 , 55 ] .
in brief , social - demographic characteristics included gender ( male , female ) , age ( 20 - 34 , 35 - 44 , 45 - 54 , 55 - 64 , 65 plus ) , education ( junior high school or less , high school , college or above ) , currently married ( yes , no ) .
bmi was calculated by weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared ( kg / m2 ) , and recoded as a three - category variable (< 19 , >= 19 & < 25 , >= 25 ) .
the self - rated health was an ordinal five - point variable , ranked as very good , good , fair , bad , and very bad .
responses of " very good " and " good " were collapsed into the " good " category , and responses of " poor " and " very poor " were recoded as " poor " .
additionally , the hope for the future was categorized as very hopeful or hopeful , fair , hopeless or very hopeless , and unknown .
based on the health insurance structure in urban china [ 60 ] , the variable of health insurance included the following categories : basic employee medical insurance ( bemi ) , government insurance scheme , medical aid , private medical insurance , other programs related to medical services , and uninsured .
as the bemi is the basic health insurance provided for urban employees in china , and covers both the outpatient and inpatient services [ 60 ] , so the variable was recoded as bemi , other insurances , and uninsured .
the household annual expenditure was derived from the summation of the 16 items listed in table 1 , and was categorized into three groups : <= 10,000 rmb , > 10,000 & <= 20,000 rmb , and > 20,000 rmb .
debts , smoking status and drinking status were all dichotomized variables ( yes / no ) ; employment status was grouped into employed , retired , and unemployed .
table 1 wording of questions comprising variables included in the analyses variables question suicidal ideation during the past 12 months , did you ever consider suicide ?
currently married what is your current marital status ?
body mass index what is your height in centimeter ?
& what is your weight in kilogram ?
self - rated health how would you rate your health when compared with same - aged peers ?
depression center for epidemiologic studies depression scale hope do you feel hopeful about the future ?
health insurance what is your health insurance ?
household annual expenditure ( rmb / year ) what is the annual household expenditure for the following items : food , smoke & alcohol , clothes , daily necessities , durable goods , labor services , children education , adult education and training , alimony payment , gifts , transportation , water / electricity , communication , medical service , house renting , others .
debts during the past year , did your family have any debts ?
employment what is your current employment status ?
currently smoking during the past month , whether do you smoke or not ?
currently drinking during the past month , whether do you drink or not ?
data entry and statistics analysis statistical analysis in this study involved in four steps .
first , cross - tabulations were computed to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation in all of the respondents and among different groups .
p values were obtained to test the difference between independent variables and suicidal ideation .
as suicidal ideation is a dichotomized variable , logistic regression model was used in this study .
univariate logistic regressions were then performed separately for all independent variables .
next , all the procedures above were conducted in the female and male subgroups .
then all variables used in the univariate analysis entered into a multivariate logistic regression simultaneously .
the adjusted odd ratios ( aors ) , 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % ci ) and p values of influence factors were obtained .
finally , two separate logistic regressions were performed to determine associations between influence factors and suicidal ideation among males and females , respectively .
in addition , the listwise deletion was employed to address the missing data in all statistical analyses .
the level of significance was set as 5 % throughout the study .
data analyses were performed using stata12.0 ( statacorp lp , college station , texas , usa ) .
results of the 4291 respondents in this study , 184 ( 4.29 %) reported having suicidal ideation during the past 12 months .
the distributions of suicidal ideation among different influence factors and the results of univariate logistic analysis were shown in table 2 .
specifically , males reported less suicidal ideation than females ( 3.62 % vs. 5.04 %) .
furthermore , the univariate analysis showed that ( table 2 ) there were significantly statistical difference among all the independent variables ( all had a p value < 0.05 ) , except for the following variables : age ( p = 0.966 ) , education ( p = 0.138 ) , smoking ( p = 0.719 ) , and drinking ( p = 0.126 ) .
participants , who were unmarried , had abnormal bmi , reported self - rated poor health , were depressed , felt hopeless for the future , did not have insurance or other insurances , had lower family expenditure , had debts , and were unemployed reported suicidal ideation more often than their counterparts ( all p value < 0.05 ) .

the results of chi - square tests indicated that suicidal ideation among both females and males differed significantly by marital status , self - rated health , depression status , hope , health insurance , and debts ( all p value < 0.05 ) .
however , smoking was only found to be significant among females ( p = 0.005 ) ; conversely , bmi ( p = 0.001 ) , employment ( p = 0.001 ) , and drinking ( p = 0.027 ) were only significantly associated with suicidal ideation among males .
univariate logistic analyses confirmed the trends in the correlation analyses for females and males .

for females , being currently unmarried ( aor = 1.84 , p = 0.027 ) , depression ( aor = 2.79 , p < 0.001 ) , feeling hopeless ( aor = 1.92 , p = 0.060 ) , having debts ( aor = 2.69 , p < 0.001 ) , and currently smoking ( aor = 3.01 , p = 0.019 ) were positively associated with suicidal ideation .
among males , depression ( aor = 1.99 , p = 0.009 ) , having other insurances ( aor = 1.92 , p = 0.044 ) , and currently drinking ( aor = 2.01 , p = 0.022 ) was positively associated with suicidal ideation .
a negative association was also found between household annual expenditure between > 10,000 & <= 20000 rmb and suicidal ideation among males ( aor = 0.52 , p = 0.050 ) .
only depression was significantly associated with suicidal ideation among both females and males .
bmi , self - rated health and employment were not significantly in both genders .
it is worth noting that smoking and drinking were not significant in the full model ; however , smoking was a risk factor for females , and drinking was a risk factor for males .

the 12 - month prevalence in this study was lower than that in rural chinese aged 16 - 34 years ( 5.2 %) [ 23 ] and that in older adults aged 50 years or older in rural china ( 8.8 %) [ 26 ] ; however , it was higher than that in rural residents from developed zhejiang province [ 24 ] .
theoretically , the lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation was higher than the 12 - month prevalence [ 1 ] .
therefore , we can conclude that the 12 - month prevalence of suicidal ideation in undeveloped urban districts may be higher than that in developed metropolises , and lower than that in undeveloped rural areas .
in other words , this study confirmed the protective effects of economic development and urbanization against suicide and suicidal ideation in china [ 23 , 61 , 62 ] .
influence factors of suicidal ideation in this study , all influence factors examined in univariate analysis were found to be significantly different in subjects with and without suicide ideation , except for age , education , drinking and smoking ( table 2 ) .
subsequently , multivariate logistic regressions further confirmed several risk factors for suicidal ideation including being unmarried [ 23 , 25 ] , depression [ 21 , 36 , 37 ] , feeling hopeless [ 21 , 25 ] , having debts [ 38 , 63 ] and currently drinking [ 27 , 34 ] .
it is important to point out that there were disparities between results of univariate regression analysis and multivariate regression analysis .
these disparities may be led by the difference of the statistical methods , the univariate regression analysis help us investigate whether a relationship exists between two paired variables , however , multivariate regression analysis aims to determine which variables influence the outcome among a set of variables .
it was intriguing to find that bemi served as a protective factor against suicidal ideation when compared with subjects who were uninsured and those with other insurances .
a recent study , conducted by our research team , has also found a protective function of basic health insurance against depression [ 49 ] , and this study further confirmed the protective impact of basic health insurance on suicidal ideation in the general population .
however , the protective role of insurance , after achievement of universal coverage , should be further examined by longitudinal study in the future .
age was not significantly associated with suicidal ideation , even those aged 65 or older did not show higher prevalence of 12 - month suicidal ideation in this study .
it was analogous to the situation of finding a similar prevalence among working - age adults and older adults in hong kong [ 21 , 37 ] , but was inconsistent to the results of rural residents in sichuan province [ 23 , 26 ] .
even though , we would like to point out that there has been no large - scale study on this topic by using standardized assessment tools among both rural and urban areas in mainland china .
therefore , the epidemiology of suicidal ideation in china needs to be explored through further researches .
furthermore , education , employment status , and bmi were not significantly associated with suicidal ideation in multivariate regression model .
previous studies , conducted in china [ 23 , 64 ] and france [ 65 ] , showed that lower education levels and being unemployed were significantly associated with increased odds of reporting suicidal ideation .
however , another study , conducted by bromet , e. j. et al .
[ 66 ] , showed that low education were not significant risk factors for the lifetime ideation .
these discrepancies may be due to the characteristics of sample , and need to be further studied .
it is important to point out that the association between bmi and suicidal ideation still remains unclear .
carpenter et al. concluded that increased bmi was associated with higher suicide ideation for women , however , lower bmi was associated with suicide ideation for men [ 40 ] .
the overall significant positive associations between bmi and suicidal ideation were also found by mather et al .
[ 41 ] , wagner et al .
[ 42 ] , and dutton , g. r. et al .
[ 43 ] .
among u.s. youth , perceived overweight was a statistically significant risk factor for suicide attempts [ 67 ] .
however , goldney , r. d. et al .
[ 68 ] revealed that the assumption " increased bmi is necessarily associated with suicidal ideation " was not tenable .
gender difference of prevalence and risk factors the higher prevalence of suicidal ideation among females ( female vsmale : 5.04 % vs 3.62 %) was consistent with previous findings in chinese population [ 4 , 23 ] .
however , being female was not a significant variable in the regression model after controlling other variables ( aor = 0.83 , p = 0.351 ) .
the disappearance of gender - difference in suicidal ideation is contrary to previous studies , in which females experienced a significantly greater risk of reporting suicidal ideation than males [ 23 , 26 ] .
a recent meta - analysis also estimated that aor of the pooled suicidal ideation for females was 1.43 ( 95 % ci = 1.25 - 1.64 ) in a chinese population [ 34 ] .
the disappearance of gender - differences in this study may be partly explained by the characteristics of this sample .
for example , females in our sample came from urban community , and their social - economic statuses , compared with males , were relatively better than those from rural areas .
actually , it was found that the female - male suicide ratio has decreased sharply [ 12 ] , because of the improvement in females' social - economic status in recent years [ 23 ] .
however , this interpretation need to be further examined in the future .
this study revealed the different influence factors of suicidal ideation between females and males , which were less emphasized by previous studies .
the only shared risk factor of suicidal ideation was depression , a well - known risk factor for suicide and suicidal ideation [ 34 ] , suggests that mental illness is still a major challenge for preventing suicide in china .
in this sample , debt was only associated with suicidal ideation in females but not in males .
in addition , household annual expenditure of > 10,000 & <= 20,000 rmb was a protective factor against suicidal ideation in males ( marginal difference , p = 0.05 ) , but not in females .
these results indicated that males benefit more from better economic status than females , while females were easier influenced by negative economic situation ( i.e. , having debts ) .
females may be more vulnerable when they experienced the life - events including being unmarried , depression , uninsured , and having debts , compared with males .
this finding is inconsistent with the results of studies from western countries , which found debts were significantly correlated with higher suicidal ideation among general population .
a study [ 69 ] in european and american countries found that the 2008 global economic crisis mainly influenced the suicide rate in men .
another study , conducted by turvey c et al. , revealed that financial loss rather than low income remained a significant correlate of suicidal ideation after controlling for depression [ 29 ] .
similarly , hintikka et al. concluded that difficulty in repaying debts is an independent factor that is associated with suicidal ideation [ 70 ] .
a more recent study also indicated that the population in debt were twice as likely to have suicidal ideation after controlling for the socio - demographic , economic , social and lifestyle factors [ 63 ] .
another more recent study also indicated that poorer financial perception was associated with more prevalent suicidal ideation [ 23 ] .
one possible explanation for the difference may be that the traditional cultural values in china were different from western countries. of course , this hypothesis should be further explored .
finally , smoking and drinking status were not significant influence factors of suicidal ideation in the full model ; however , smoking was a significant risk factor in females , and drinking was a significant factor in males .
this difference may be explained by the much higher smoking rate in males than females in china ( 52.9 % vs. 2.4 %) [ 71 ] .
two studies showed that current smoking were associated with suicidal ideation [ 25 , 27 ] , another two studies further indicated that daily smoking was associated with suicidal ideation in women but not in men [ 65 , 72 ] .
however , there were no significant differences between suicidal ideation and smoking status in other studies [ 66 , 73 ] .
now , china is the largest consumer of tobacco in the world , with an estimated 301 million current smokers .
therefore , the inter - relationships of smoking and suicide ideation need to be considered in the future .
on the other hand , drinking was a risk factor for males in this study , which was similar with previous studies which confirmed alcohol abuse disorders are more common in males suicides [ 46 , 74 ] .
limitations and strengths of this study several limitations of this study should be acknowledged .
first , as a cross - sectional study , this study was unable to prove a causal - effect relationship between risk factors and suicidal ideation .
second , as the sample was selected from two cities of gansu province , a conservative generalization of the findings of this study should be applied when considering the diversity of social - economic status on other populations .
third , suicidal ideation was assessed by using a single question , which could not distinguish the severity of the suicide risk .
the independent measuring tools should be utilized in epidemiological or clinical study in the future .
fourth , more valid measures , such as beek depression invertory beck ( bdi - 21 ) and patient health questionnaire ( phq - 9 ) , should be used in the future study , although the ces - d scale has been used extensively in previous studies .
fifth , social support and personality were not measured in this study .
sixth , although gender differences were observed in this study , the underlying mechanisms for those influence factors remain unclear .
regardless of those limitations , this study with a large sample size provided several contributions to current knowledge about suicidal ideation .
1 ) this study may be the first study conducted within a general population in an undeveloped urban area of china .
2 ) detailed risk factors of suicidal ideation were investigated among a large number of populations .
3 ) the gender - specific differences were justified by using statistics analyses , which will be beneficial for the design and implementation of suicidal prevention strategies .
conclusion in conclusion , suicide is an urgent public health issue in china , comprehensive suicide prevention strategies should be developed or strengthened in order to prevent suicide ideation in china .
in the future , a longitudinal study is needed to confirm the casual relation between gender - specific influence factors and suicidal ideation , and more attention should be paid to gender difference in the prevention strategy for suicide .

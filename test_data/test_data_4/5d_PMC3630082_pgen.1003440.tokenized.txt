x inactivation - - the transcriptional silencing of one x chromosome copy per female somatic cell - - is universal among therian mammals , yet the choice of which x to silence exhibits considerable variation among species .
x inactivation strategies can range from strict paternally inherited x inactivation ( pxi ) , which renders females haploid for all maternally inherited alleles , to unbiased random x inactivation ( rxi ) , which equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each female tissue .
however , the underlying evolutionary processes that might account for this observed diversity of x inactivation strategies remain unclear .
we present a theoretical population genetic analysis of x inactivation evolution and specifically consider how conditions of dominance , linkage , recombination , and sex - differential selection each influence evolutionary trajectories of x inactivation .
the results indicate that a single , critical interaction between allelic dominance and sex - differential selection can select for a broad and continuous range of x inactivation strategies , including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited x chromosomes .
rxi is favored over complete pxi as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive , and the criteria for rxi evolution is considerably more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic ( i.e. , alleles deleterious to females are beneficial to males ) relative to variation that is deleterious to both sexes .
evolutionary transitions from pxi to rxi also generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness .
these results provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome - wide expression of x - linked genes and lead to several useful predictions that could motivate future studies of allele - specific gene expression variation .
author summary with the exception of its most primitive members , mammal species practice x inactivation , where one copy of each x chromosome pair is silenced in each cell of the female body .
the particular copy of the x that is silenced nevertheless shows considerable variability among species , and the evolutionary causes for this variability remain unclear .
here , we show that x inactivation strategies are likely to evolve in response to the sex - differential fitness properties of x - linked genetic variation .
genetic variation with similar effects on male and female fitness will generally favor the evolution of random x inactivation , potentially including preferential inactivation of the maternally inherited x chromosome .
variation with opposing fitness effects in each sex (" sexually antagonistic " variation , which includes mutations that both decrease female fitness and enhance male fitness ) selects for preferential or complete inactivation of the paternally inherited x. paternally biased x inactivation patterns appear to be common in nature , which suggests that sexually antagonistic genetic variation might be an important factor underlying the evolution of x inactivation .
the theory provides a conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of x inactivation strategies and generates several novel predictions that may soon be tested with modern genome sequencing technologies .

introduction mammalian females transcriptionally silence one of their two x chromosomes within each somatic cell - a process called x inactivation [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
the basic phenomenon of x inactivation occurs in all therian ( non egg - laying ) mammals studied to date , yet the specific x chromosome silenced exhibits considerable diversity among species .
at one extreme , typical of marsupials , the paternally inherited x is universally silenced and the maternally inherited x is ubiquitously expressed ([ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ; hereafter referred to as paternal x inactivation or pxi ) .
in contrast , placental mammals practice random x inactivation ( rxi ) : each somatic cell may express either the maternally or the paternally inherited x ( the other x is silenced ) , and female bodies are composed of a mosaic of cells that individually express one of the two x chromosome copies [ 5 ] .
while rxi is generally thought to be unbiased - with each cell having an equal probability of expressing either of the two x chromosomes - recent data reveal quantitatively biased inactivation patterns in at least some placental mammal species , i.e. : differential silencing of maternally and paternally derived x chromosomes [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
several marsupial studies similarly find evidence for partial expression of the paternally derived x , suggesting additional species - specificity of x inactivation rules ( reviewed in [ 2 ] , [ 8 ]) .
the selective processes that might account for this observed diversity remain unclear .
a leading hypothesis for the evolution of rxi is that it might be favored if segregating deleterious mutations have recessive or partially recessive fitness effects ([ 9 ] - [ 11 ] ; which , on average , they do [ 12 ] - [ 15 ]) .
the logic underlying this hypothesis is straightforward .
females that uniformly silence a particular copy of the x ( e.g. , the paternally inherited copy under pxi ) will be effectively haploid , and suffer the full fitness costs of mutations carried on their expressed x chromosome .
rxi generates an expression pattern that is more similar to diploidy , and can potentially mask the fitness costs of carrying deleterious alleles .
while the masking hypothesis for the evolutionary origins of rxi is plausible ( e.g. , [ 1 ] , [ 16 ] - [ 20 ]) , its feasibility should be investigated in a formal population genetic model .
models of a similar evolutionary scenario , the evolution of haploid versus diploid life cycles ( e.g. , [ 21 ] - [ 25 ]) , indicate that selection for masking of deleterious mutations favors the evolution of diploidy , if mutations are sufficiently recessive relative to the population 's recombination rate ([ 26 ] - [ 30 ] ; however , selection to mask somatic mutations eliminates constraints imposed by tight linkage [ 31 ]) .
however , these models do not incorporate the unique properties of sex - differential selection and inheritance that govern x chromosome evolution [ 32 ] , so it remains unclear whether their conclusions apply to the case of rxi .
sex differences in selection - where the fitness effects of single mutations differ in magnitude or direction between males and females - likely influence large fractions of animal genomes [ 33 ] - [ 36 ] , which can have two potential consequences for the evolutionary diversification of x inactivation strategies .
stronger selection against deleterious alleles in males compared to females should decrease the average proportion of deleterious alleles carried on each paternally derived x ( e.g. , [ 10 ] , [ 33 ]) , and thereby favor expressing the paternally inherited x .
" sexually antagonistic alleles " - alleles that increase fitness when present in one sex , but decrease fitness in the other sex [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] - should have the opposite effect on x inactivation .
alleles benefiting males and costly to females experience higher probabilities of paternal transmission ( e.g. , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ]) , which could generate selection to preferentially inactivate , or even ubiquitously silence , paternally inherited x chromosomes .
several models have examined how sexually antagonistic selection might favor the evolution genomic imprinting , which similarly involves the unequal expression of maternally and paternally inherited gene copies [ 40 ] - [ 44 ] .
however , the effect of sexually antagonistic fitness variation on x inactivation evolution has yet to be addressed .
it is currently unclear how the population genetic parameters of dominance , sex - differential selection , and linkage and recombination might jointly influence the evolution of x inactivation strategies .
we therefore developed a mathematical model of x inactivation evolution , and used this model to identify biological conditions that favor the evolution of different x inactivation states .
we first consider the dichotomous case of rxi versus pxi , describe the conditions facilitating evolutionary transitions to rxi , and characterize the consequences of such transitions for mean fitness of males and females .
overall , selection on mammalian x inactivation strategies is primarily mediated by the interaction between dominance and sex - differential selection , and the situation differs considerably from scenarios that favor the evolution of diploidy .
we also examine whether sex - differential selection might favor the evolution of biased x inactivation strategies ( i.e. , quantitatively unequal expression of maternally versus paternally derived x chromosomes ) and predict the magnitude of biases likely to evolve .
our results suggest that conditions for evolving biased inactivation patterns are extremely permissive .
results development of the model we focus on the simplest and most analytically tractable model that simultaneously incorporates genetic linkage , variation for fitness , and variation in the form of x inactivation .
our model follows the evolution of two bi - allelic loci .
locus a ( the " fitness locus ") is x - linked and carries a 1 and a 2 alleles , which directly influence male and female fitness .
locus b ( the " modifier locus ") carries b 1 and b 2 alleles , which influence the x inactivation rule in females within the population .
the genotype at locus b can influence female fitness through its effect on the relative expression of a 1 versus a 2 alleles in heterozygotes .
variation at the b locus has no other phenotypic effect in males or females and is therefore neutral in males .
we consider two scenarios of linkage for the b locus .
under x - linkage , a and b are physically linked , and recombine at a rate r , per female meiosis ( the x does not recombine in males , which have only one x chromosome copy ) .
when b is on an autosome , alleles at a and b loci segregate independently during meiosis .
to model the evolution of x inactivation , we begin with the b locus initially fixed for allele b 1 , and the a locus at polymorphic equilibrium given b 1 fixed .
we then characterize selection on and evolution of a novel b 2 allele that changes a female carrier 's x inactivation system .
the population is assumed to be sufficiently large that genetic drift can be ignored , and each generation is discrete .
the life cycle during each generation follows the order of birth , selection , recombination , mutation , random mating and syngamy .
our approach bears many similarities to models for the evolution of ploidy cycles ( e.g. , [ 26 ] , [ 45 ] chapter 8 of [ 46 ]) , and for the evolution of sexually dimorphic genomic imprinting [ 40 ] , [ 44 ] , with which we draw contrasts .
generalized two - locus recursions ( see methods ) include sixteen different female genotypes ( when allowing for parent - of - origin effects ) and at least four male genotypes ( four for the x - linked modifier model ; eight for the autosomal modifier model ) .
to reduce the enormous range of possible fitness parameterizations and initial population conditions , we focus our attention on a subset of idealized and biologically relevant population genetic scenarios in the following analyses .
we consider two basic forms of fitness variation at the a locus ( table 1 ) : ( 1 ) deleterious alleles maintained at a balance between recurrent mutation and purifying selection ; and ( 2 ) sexually antagonistic alleles stably maintained as balanced polymorphisms .
in both scenarios , the female - deleterious allele is denoted by a 1 , i.e. female fitness is highest in a 2 homozygotes , and fitness of heterozygous females is assumed to be intermediate to the two homozygous genotypes [ formally , w ( a 1 a 1 ) = 1 - sf <= w ( a 1 a 2 ) , w ( a 2 a 1 )<= w ( a 2 a 2 ) = 1 , where w ( aiaj ) is the fitness of a female with genotype aiaj , and sf describes the fitness cost to females of being homozygous or haploid for the a 1 allele : 1 > sf > 0 ] .
when a 1 is also deleterious to males , it will be maintained at mutation - selection balance ( sm is the fitness cost to males of carrying an a1 allele ; 1 > sm > 0 ; table 1 ) .
we also consider genetic polymorphism maintained by sexual antagonism , where a 2 is the deleterious allele for males ( here , tm is the fitness cost to males of carrying an a 2 allele ; 1 > tm > 0 ; see table 1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1003440.t001 table 1 fitnesses and frequencies of genotypes at the a locus.1 females genotype : a 1 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 1 a 2 a 2 frequency in zygotes : qmqf qf ( 1 - qm ) qm ( 1 - qf ) ( 1 - qf )( 1 - qm ) fitness : 1 - sf 1 - sfhmat 1 - sfhpat 1 males genotype : a 1 a 2 frequency in zygotes : qf 1 - qf fitness ( a 1 deleterious ) : 1 - sm 1 fitness ( a 2 deleterious ) : 1 1 - tm 1 the maternally inherited allele is listed first and the paternally inherited allele is listed second ; frequencies in gametes are qf = [ a 1 ] in eggs and qm = [ a 1 ] in sperm ; 0 < sf , sm , tm , hmat , hpat < 1 .
in an ancestral population fixed for b 1 , female somatic cell lineages are assumed to silence the paternally inherited x with probability xi 11 and silence the maternal x with probability 1 - xi 11 ( 0 <= xi 11 <= 1 ) .
under unbiased rxi ( where xi 11 = ( 1 / 2 )) , heterozygous females have fitness w ( a 1 a 2 ) = w ( a 2 a 1 ) = 1 - sfh , where h represents the degree of masking of the a 1 allele ( 0 < h < 1 ) .
thus , h is a scaling factor that is analogous to the dominance coefficient of standard population genetic models .
use of the terms " dominance " and " recessivity " , applied to species with rxi , has been questioned because individual cells lack bi - allelic expression [ 47 ] .
however , the dominance coefficient remains useful as a population genetic parameter , and simply quantifies the relative fitness of heterozygous versus homozygous genotypes when heterozygotes practice an unbiased rxi rule .
partial masking is clearly relevant for many x - linked disorders , which tend to be less penetrant and less severe in females than males [ 47 ] .
when x inactivation is biased ( xi 11 !=( 1 / 2 )) , fitness is function of h ( as defined above ) and parent - of - origin effects generated by the x inactivation rule .
assuming that female fitness decreases monotonically with the proportion of cells expressing the a 1 allele , we can describe it using a generalized power function , w ( x ) = 1 - xksf , where x represents the proportion of cells expressing the a 1 allele , and k is a positive constant that describes the specific shape of the fitness decline associated with a1 expression ( such functions are often used in evolutionary theory because of their flexibility ; e.g. , [ 48 ] - [ 50 ]) .
for our purposes , w ( x ) has two essential properties .
first , fitness approaches unity when a 2 is ubiquitously expressed ( i.e. , ) , and 1 - sf when a 1 is ubiquitously expressed ( i.e. , ) , which makes intuitive sense .
second , k can be defined in terms of the dominance coefficient of a 1 .
when xi 11 = ( 1 / 2 ) , x = xi 11 = 1 - xi 11 ; therefore , h = 1 / 2k and k = - ln ( h )/ ln ( 2 ) .
a 1 is partially dominant to a 2 when h >( 1 / 2 ) ( k < 1 ) and partially recessive when h <( 1 / 2 ) ( k > 1 ) .
consequently , hmat = xi 11 k represents the effective dominance coefficient when a 1 is maternally inherited , and hpat = ( 1 - xi 11 ) k represents the effective dominance coefficient when a 1 is paternally inherited ( table 1 ; figure 1 ) .
nonadditivity of allelic effects ( i.e. , h !=( 1 / 2 )) can arise when the fitness of an x - linked genotype is not cell - autonomous ( e.g. , fitness depends on the overall proportion of a 1 versus a 2 expression in female bodies ; [ 43 ] , [ 51 ]). with cell - autonomous effects , we can model total fitness as the mean fitness per cell [ 43 ] , such that w ( a 1 a 2 ) = 1 - xi 11 sf and w ( a 2 a 1 ) = 1 - ( 1 - xi 11 ) sf , which represents a special case of the generalized power function ( i.e. , k = 1 and h = ( 1 / 2 )) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1003440.g001 figure 1 relationship between x inactivation rule and parent - of - origin dominance coefficients ( hmat , hpat ; see table 1 ) .
results are based on the power function for female fitness , w ( x ) = 1 - xksf , where x represents the proportion of female cells expressing the a 1 allele , sf is the haploid or homozygous selection coefficient , h is the degree of masking ( equivalent to a dominance coefficient of a 1 ) in individuals practicing unbiased rxi ( xi 11 = ( 1 / 2 )) , and k = - ln ( 2 )/ ln ( h ) .

the figure is modified from , and inspired by , figure 1a of [ 50 ] .
given the outlined assumptions , we obtain the following equilibria with respect to the x - linked fitness - determining locus .
when a 1 is deleterious to both sexes , its equilibrium frequencies at mutation - selection balance ( in females and males , respectively ) are : ( 1 ) where u is the mutation rate to a 1 , hmat = xi 11 k , and hpat = ( 1 - xi 11 ) k , and k = - ln ( h )/ ln ( 2 ). eq .
( 1 ) was previously derived in [ 52 ] ( see text s1 ) .
when a 1 is sexually antagonistic ( i.e. , deleterious to females but beneficial to males ) , and with balancing selection acting at the a locus , the equilibrium frequencies of a 1 are : ( 2 ) versions of which have been derived in several previous studies [ 43 ] , [ 52 ] - [ 54 ] .
the balancing selection criteria for sexually antagonistic polymorphism are provided ( text s1 ; for additional results and discussion , see [ 43 ] , [ 52 ] , [ 54 ] - [ 56 ]) .
evolution of random x inactivation pxi is thought to represent the ancestral x inactivation state , from which rxi evolved [ 1 ] , [ 57 ] .
we therefore sought to define the population genetic conditions in which a rare b 2 allele that causes unbiased rxi ( where xi 12 = ( 1 / 2 ) represents the x inactivation strategy played by individuals heterozygous at the modifier locus ) will invade a population that is initially fixed for the pxi strategy ( xi 11 = 1 ) .
mutation - selection balance to examine whether segregating recessive deleterious mutations might be sufficiently masked by rxi to render such a strategy favorable to pxi ([ 10 ] , [ 11 ] ; see above ) , we performed a linear stability analysis using our general recursions ( see methods ) , and evaluated at the equilibrium with b 1 fixed in the population and a 1 at mutation - selection balance .
as predicted , selection favors invasion of a modifier allele ( b 2 ) causing rxi when the deleterious allele is sufficiently masked in heterozygotes ( i.e. , h is sufficiently small ) .
assuming weak mutation at locus a ( 0 < u << 1 ) , the critical dominance coefficient under rxi is approximately : ( 3 ) selection favors the evolution of rxi when h < hcrit ( figure 2 ) .
note that eq .
( 3 ) is independent of the recombination rate between the a and b loci .
this result applies equally to scenarios of x and autosomal linkage of the modifier locus .

black curves are based on eq .
( 3 ) for the mutation - selection balance model of genetic variation ( in which case , the x - axis refers to the female selection coefficient , sf ) .
the gray curve is based on eq .
( 4 ) for sexually antagonistic alleles maintained by balancing selection ( here , the x - axis refers to the male selection coefficient : tm ) .
the area above each curve represents parameter space where unbiased rxi is not favored over pxi .
rxi is favored under the complementary parameter space below each curve .
when selection is weak ( sm , sf - - > 0 ) , deleterious alleles need only be partially masked ( h <( 1 / 2 )) for rxi to be favored .
increasing the strength of purifying selection alters hcrit , with stronger selection in males than females ( large sm / sf ratios ) expanding the parameter space in which rxi evolves , and female - biased selection decreasing it ( small sm / sf ratios ) .
this effect of differing selection strengths between the sexes has two contributing causes .
first , expression of the paternally inherited x ( as opposed to the maternal x ) is favored because the frequency of deleterious mutations is lower on the paternal x. second , purifying selection , primarily in males , limits the buildup of linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) between b 2 alleles and deleterious mutations , which can also prevent the invasion of b 2 alleles .
this ld is generated from the epistatic interaction for female fitness between a and b locus genotypes , and there is no such epistasis in males .
limited evolution of ld expands the parameter space of dominance that permits the evolution of rxi .
sexually antagonistic variation sexually antagonistic variation for fitness or its components has been detected in a variety of natural and experimental populations ( e.g. , [ 58 ] - [ 66 ]) .
sexually antagonistic alleles polymorphic at an x - linked locus could potentially exert selection on x inactivation strategies .
our linear stability analysis of a population fixed for b 1 , with a deterministic balanced polymorphism for male - beneficial and female - deleterious alleles ( eq .
( 2 ) , with xi 11 = 1 ) , shows that rxi will evolve when the dominance coefficient for the female - deleterious allele falls below the following threshold : ( 4 ) which is again independent of the linkage relationships between loci .
under weak selection ( tm - - > 0 ) , female - detrimental alleles need only be partially masked for rxi to be favored , but overall , the conditions are considerably more restrictive than the mutation - selection balance model .
strong sexually antagonistic selection severely reduces the parameter space that favors the evolution of rxi ( figure 2 ) .
thus , rxi can be selected against , despite strong effects of masking female - detriment alleles .
this occurs when strong selection in males causes male - benefit / female - deleterious alleles to be disproportionately transmitted by male gametes .
changes in mean fitness when rxi evolves evolutionary transitions that influence gene ploidy levels ( e.g. , transitions from haploidy to diploidy ) permit deleterious mutations to accumulate within populations , and reduce long - term population fitness ( i.e. , the new equilibrium fitness [ 21 ] , [ 67 ] ; however , epistasis can sometimes render diploidy advantageous [ 23 ]) , which is why recombination is required for diploidy to evolve [ 26 ] - [ 30 ] .
under tight linkage , alleles for diploidy are co - transmitted with deleterious mutations , and fitness benefits of masking can be outweighed by the increased burden of linked , deleterious mutations .
recombination decouples such associations , and permits diploidy to evolve , despite the long - term fitness cost .
such interactions between ploidy and recombination have parallels in various other aspects of genome evolution , including the evolution of genomic imprinting [ 44 ] , [ 68 ] and the establishment of gene duplicates [ 69 ] , [ 70 ] .
in contrast , the evolution of rxi does not require recombination ( as shown above ) , and this insensitivity to linkage can similarly be considered in light of mean fitness changes that follow an evolutionary transition from pxi to rxi .
for the mutation - selection balance model , equilibrium mean male and female fitnesses ( respectively ) under pxi and unbiased rxi are : ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) which each ignore terms of o ( u 2 ) .
for the parameter space where rxi can evolve [ h < 3 /( 6 - 2sm + sf ) ; see eq .
( 3 )] , mean male fitness is always lower under rxi ( as long as sm > 0 ; otherwise fitness does not change ) .
mean female fitness becomes higher , as the evolution of rxi shifts some of the burden of purifying selection ( removing deleterious mutations ) from females to males .
the fitness cost to males at the new equilibrium is offset by fitness gains to females , which provides an intuitive explanation as to why selection for rxi is insensitive to linkage .
tightly linked deleterious alleles may hitchhike with a modifier for rxi , yet such associations do not overturn the net benefits of masking .
for the case of an evolutionary transition from pxi to rxi driven by sexually antagonistic polymorphism [ in the parameter space where rxi can evolve , i.e. : h <( 1 - tm )/( 2 - tm ) ; see eq .
( 4 )] , the new equilibrium frequency of the male - beneficial / female - detrimental allele will be higher when tm < sf , and lower when tm > sf. mean male fitness is therefore increased after the transition when sf > tm , decreased when sf < tm , and otherwise remains unchanged .
the mean female fitness is increased under a much broader range of conditions , because the masking effect caused by rxi can sometimes offset a higher derived frequency of the female - deleterious allele .
the condition necessary for female fitness to be increased following the evolution of rxi is : ( 6 ) where hcrit = ( 1 - tm )/( 2 - tm ) .
as shown in figure 3 , parameter conditions favoring the evolution of rxi generally lead to an increase in mean female fitness , whereas mean male fitness is increased in exactly half of the relevant parameter space .
the new mean fitness is always increased in one sex at least , and in some cases , in both sexes .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1003440.g003 figure 3 sexually antagonistic fitness variation and the change in mean fitness following the evolution of rxi .
in an ancestral population with pxi , and segregating for a sexually antagonistic balanced polymorphism , unbiased rxi is favored and may evolve when h < hcrit = ( 1 - tm )/( 2 - tm ) .
following such an evolutionary transition , the male - beneficial / female - detrimental allele approaches a new equilibrium frequency , and mean fitness per sex evolves to a new equilibrium .
for the model of sexually antagonistic genetic variation , our analysis of the change in equilibrium mean fitness follows the evolution of the ancestrally polymorphic locus , and ignores any sexually antagonistic x - linked mutations that might enter the population following the transition to rxi .
however , the parameter space that permits an x - linked sexually antagonistic polymorphism is larger under rxi than pxi , within the relevant parameter space where rxi can evolve ( pxi can nevertheless be more conducive to polymorphism under alternative dominance parameterizations [ 52 ]) , and recessive sexually antagonistic alleles that benefit males weakly can more readily be maintained [ 54 ] , [ 71 ] .
therefore , the evolution of rxi could increase the parameter space that permits x - linked sexually antagonistic polymorphism .
antagonistically selected x - linked loci that could not establish balanced polymorphisms in the ancestral population with pxi may do so in an rxi population .
in the longer - term , this could increase male and decrease female fitness , contingent on the specific distribution of male and female selection and dominance coefficients among sexually antagonistic mutations .
the evolution of biased rxi thus far we have shown that rxi can be favored by selection if female - detrimental alleles are sufficiently masked when heterozygous .
however , selection might not necessarily favor the same rate of inactivation for maternally and paternally derived x chromosomes in females .
sex - differential selection generates allele frequency differences between males and females , which can favor differential expression of genes inherited from opposite - sex parents [ 40 ]. with respect to the mammalian x , polymorphism under sex - differential selection might favor the evolution of unequal inactivation rates between paternally and maternally derived x chromosomes ; this is conceptually similar to genomic imprinting that involves partial , but unequal , expression of both of the parental gene copies [ 72 ] - [ 79 ] .
because x inactivation is a female - limited trait , we expect that selection will favor preferential inactivation of the chromosome with a greater probability of carrying female - deleterious alleles .
we tested this intuition by performing an invasion analysis ([ 46 ] , chapter 12 ) to determine the evolutionary stability of different x inactivation strategies .
to characterize the direction and magnitude of the bias favored by selection , we consider a population initially fixed for an arbitrary inactivation strategy , xi 11 ( 0 < xi 11 < 1 ) , and at equilibrium for fitness variation given this strategy [ e.g. , eqs .
( 1 - 2 )] , and identify the xi 11 values that are stable to invasion by an allele that alters the x inactivation ratio of female carriers ( i.e. the " evolutionarily stable strategies " [ 80 ]) .
under a mutation - selection balance model , the stable paternal x inactivation value () is : ( 7 ) the exponent term [ - ln ( 2 )/ ln ( 2h )] is positive when a 1 is at least partially recessive ( h <( 1 / 2 )) , which we assume here and below , and the ratio determines the direction of bias favored by selection .
selection favors preferential inactivation of the paternal x when deleterious alleles are more frequently transmitted to progeny through males than females (>( 1 / 2 ) when < 1 ) , and favors preferential inactivation of the maternal x when deleterious mutations are more frequently transmitted through females (<( 1 / 2 ) when > 1 ). eq .
( 7 ) can be expressed as an explicit function of the selection and dominance coefficients by assuming that sfh << 1 ( this is biologically reasonable given the observed negative association between dominance and effect size of deleterious mutations [ 12 ]) .
the critical ratio becomes : ( 8 ) selection favors preferential inactivation of the maternally derived x when sm > sfh , and the degree of bias may be pronounced when deleterious mutations are poorly masked in females ( e.g. , when h is closer to ( 1 / 2 ) than to zero ; figure 4 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1003440.g004 figure 4 sex - differential selection favors the evolution of biased rxi .

( 8 ) for the mutation - selection balance model of genetic variation ; diamonds are based on numerical evaluation of the more exact eq .
( 7 ) .
gray curves are based on eq .
( 9 ) for sexually antagonistic alleles maintained by balancing selection .
results for the mutation - selection balance case assume equal male and female selection coefficients ( sm = sf ) .
biases are further accentuated when sm > sf ; biases may be dampened or reversed when sm < sf. adopting the same analytical approach for the case of sexually antagonistic fitness variation , the equilibrium x inactivation rule is : ( 9 ) given the stated parameter constraints ( h <( 1 / 2 ) ; 1 > tm > 0 ) , ( 1 - tm ) - ln ( 2 )/ ln ( 2h ) will always be positive and less than one , and selection always favors preferential inactivation of the paternally inherited x chromosome .
the magnitude of this bias increases with tm and h , similar to the deleterious mutation scenario for fitness variation ( figure 4 ) .
when either the selection or the dominance coefficient is sufficiently large , both models of fitness variation can favor large x inactivation biases .
some moderate values of s , t and h ( to the left of the x - axis in figure 4 ) could lead to large enough biases - on the order of a few percent or more - to be empirically detectable .
discussion x inactivation in mammals can take a variety of specific forms , ranging from strict pxi , to various forms of rxi [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
this range of observed diversity is particularly striking , as quantitative analyses of the maternally to paternally derived x inactivation ratio are available for relatively few mammalian species to date ( the best data coming from a subset of mouse and human tissues ) .
modern high - throughput , genome - wide and allele - specific gene expression technologies ( such as rna - seq ) , can now be used to systematically analyze x inactivation ratios in any number of mammalian species or tissues [ 6 ] , [ 81 ] , and this new technology promises to reveal much more diversity in x inactivation patterns .
the range of x inactivation rules employed by different species might usefully be considered within a theoretical framework of sex - differential selection .
the population genetic models analyzed here reveal broad opportunities for x inactivation evolution , though it is important to note that model predictions hinge upon the capacity of x inactivation ratios to evolve ( i.e. , there must be genetic variation for x inactivation rules ) .
there is some evidence for alleles in mice that affect x inactivation choice ( reviewed in [ 82 ] , [ 83 ]) .
moreover , the observed range of x inactivation patterns between mice , humans , and marsupials ( see introduction ) imply at least some degree of evolutionary lability for the trait .
on the other hand , maternally biased x inactivation has not been observed , and it is unclear whether this reflects under - sampling ( the phenomenon may exist , but has yet to be documented ) , intrinsic genetic constraints ( as mentioned ) , or that biased inactivation of the maternally derived x is generally unfavorable .
the evolvability of the x inactivation ratio should be considered an important issue that warrants future study .
multiple genes , conflicting patterns of selection , and the evolution of genomic imprinting for reasons of tractability , and in parallel with theory on the evolution of diploidy ( e.g. , [ 26 ] , [ 45 ] ; chapter 8 of [ 46 ]) , we have focused our analysis on two - locus population genetics models to characterize how different forms of fitness variation and linkage will influence patterns of selection for different x inactivation rules .
however , x inactivation affects the expression of many genes simultaneously , and unique patterns of genetic variation among x - linked loci could individually favor discordant x inactivation strategies .
we can gain some insight into scenarios that involve multiple x - linked loci , under the assumption that each polymorphic locus contributes independently to selection on a rare , unlinked modifier allele ( i.e. , we assume loose linkage and no epistasis between fitness loci ; net fitness effects of multi - gene haplotypes could instead apply under tight linkage between fitness loci ) .
under these conditions , criteria for invasion of a modifier allele will be , where lambdai is the leading eigenvalue associated with the two - locus system for the modifier locus and the ith of n x - linked fitness loci ( i = { 1 , 2 , ... , n }) [ 84 ] , [ 85 ]. with weak effects of individual fitness loci on the modifier ( i.e. , lambdai =~ 1 ) , the selection coefficient associated with a rare modifier allele will be smod =~ ne ( lambdai - 1 ) , where e ( lambdai - 1 ) represents the arithmetic mean , and lambdai - 1 represents selection contributed by the ith locus ( invasion of the modifier allele requires that smod > 0 ) .
to the extent that x - linked loci segregate for deleterious alleles , and these have similar selection and dominance coefficients , the net effects of multiple x - linked loci on a modifier will be reinforcing , and the strength of selection on the x inactivation strategy will increase with the number of contributing loci ( i.e. , if e ( lambdai - 1 )!= 0 , then smod scales approximately linearly with n , the number of contributing loci ; this scaling is in agreement with multilocus models for the evolution of diploidy [ 28 ]) .
although little available data directly bear upon the sex - specific selection and dominance parameters of mammalian x - linked mutations , data from other systems suggest that most mutations have small , at least partially recessive fitness effects ( e.g. , [ 12 ] - [ 15 ] , [ 86 ]) , and are deleterious to both sexes [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
if x - linked mutations have similarly small selection and dominance coefficients under rxi , then fitness variation due to deleterious alleles might favor the evolution of relatively unbiased rxi rules .
genes that are polymorphic for sexually antagonistic alleles could exert disproportionately strong influence on the evolutionary trajectories of x inactivation evolution .
sexually antagonistic alleles generate selection of a higher order of magnitude than loci at mutation - selection balance ( figure s1 ) .
consequently , selection due to sexually antagonistic polymorphism may plausibly eclipse the cumulative effects of selection from deleterious alleles .
the relative contribution of deleterious versus antagonistically selected alleles to x - linked fitness variation is ultimately an empirical question .
to the extent that sexually antagonistic fitness variation is common in mammalian populations ( as may indeed be the case ; e.g. , [ 60 ] , [ 64 ]) , selection should favor the evolution of biased inactivation of the paternally inherited x. conflicts between different x - linked loci over the optimal ratio of maternal to paternal x inactivation could potentially be resolved by the evolution of genomic imprinting at individual x - linked genes .
previous models have considered two scenarios of sexually antagonistic selection driving the evolution of imprinting ( i.e. , the partial or complete silencing of a maternally or a paternally inherited copy of a single gene ; [ 72 ] - [ 79 ]) .
first , when the optimal transcription level of a x - linked gene differs between males and females , imprinting can facilitate sex - specific adaptation by generating sexually dimorphic gene expression [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
imprinting of the maternally inherited gene is favored under selection for higher transcription levels in females , whereas paternal imprinting is favored at genes selected for higher transcription in males [ 41 ] - [ 43 ] .
second , in genes polymorphic for sexually antagonistic alleles , sexually dimorphic imprinting can mitigate fitness costs of inheriting harmful alleles , which are preferentially transmitted from opposite - sex parents [ 40 ] .
existing models of this latter scenario consider polymorphism and imprinting at an autosomal gene [ 40 ] , [ 44 ] , yet the basic processes should apply to the x ( as discussed in [ 40 ]) - particularly so because x - linkage promotes allele frequency differences and asymmetrical imprinting effects between males and females [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 87 ] .
x inactivation and gene - by - gene imprinting may serve as complementary mechanisms for optimizing male and female fitness .
evolutionary transitions between rxi and pxi evolution of rxi from an ancestral population with pxi should be relatively unconstrained , provided three conditions are met : ( i ) there is genetic variation for rxi ( i.e. , it is evolvable ; see above ) ; ( ii ) x - linked fitness variation is largely caused by segregating deleterious mutations ; and ( iii ) the fitness costs of these mutations are at least partially masked under rxi ( i.e. , h <( 1 / 2 ) , as seems likely ) .
the availability of mutations to rxi could potentially constrain the convergent evolution of rxi in marsupials [ 18 ] .
sexually antagonistic x - linked fitness variability , if common within marsupials , could also promote the evolutionary maintenance of pxi .
this hypothesis is plausible , given the pronounced sexual size dimorphism in marsupials relative to other mammalian species ( e.g. , [ 88 ] , [ 89 ]) .
such dimorphism is indicative of strong sexual selection , which could promote the accumulation of sexually antagonistic genetic variation and thereby limit opportunities to evolve rxi .
once rxi has evolved , evolutionary reversals to strict pxi should face severe evolutionary constraints .
in populations with rxi , the filtering of genetic variation by selection in females will strongly depend upon dominance .
rxi permits the preferential accumulation of recessive , female - deleterious mutations , because such alleles experience weakened purifying selection .
the retention of recessive alleles in populations with rxi should downwardly shift the mean dominance of segregating alleles ( relative to the dominance coefficients of spontaneous mutations ; e.g. , [ 12 ] , [ 90 ]) , and increase the cost to females of becoming homozygous or effectively haploid , as they would under pxi .
filtering of mutations based on their dominance coefficients does not eliminate opportunities to evolve biased rxi , but it should severely constrain evolutionary transitions to complete pxi , which completely eliminates effects of masking .
this situation is analogous to the coevolution of outcrossing rates and inbreeding depression , with the latter expected to become more severe in outbreeding populations because they shelter recessive alleles from natural selection [ 91 ] , [ 92 ] .
species diversity for x inactivation strategies species - specific properties of mutation and genetic variation might predictably affect patterns of selection for different x inactivation strategies .
sexual selection and sex - biased mutation rates are each likely to vary among species , and both processes can influence the relative transmission probabilities of female - deleterious alleles between maternally and paternally derived x chromosomes .
mammalian mutation rates are often higher in males than females [ 93 ] , [ 94 ] , which tends to upwardly bias paternal transmission of deleterious alleles .
consider a population with unbiased rxi and a mutation rate of um and uf in males and females , respectively ( see text s1 ). with unbiased mutation ( um = uf ) , selection can favor reduced expression of the maternally inherited x when sfh < sm , as implied by eq .
( 8 ) .
male - biased mutation ( um / uf > 1 ) reduces this parameter space to ( um / uf ) sfh < sm , because males transmit a higher fraction of de - novo mutations to their daughters .
we predict that preferential inactivation of the paternally inherited x will be more common ( or more severe ) in species with strongly male - biased mutation rates .
sexual selection could similarly favor paternally biased x inactivation .
although strong purifying selection in males via sexual selection can reduce paternal transmission rates of deleterious alleles ([ 33 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] ; though not all data support this possibility , e.g. : [ 95 ] , [ 96 ]) , it will also reduce the frequencies and contributions of deleterious alleles to fitness variation in females .
sexual selection may simultaneously increase the pervasiveness of sexual antagonism [ 97 ] and the contribution of sexually antagonistic alleles to female fitness variation .
if sexually antagonistic fitness variation increases with the strength of sexual selection , then so should the degree of paternally biased x inactivation .
methods x - linked modifier model haplotype frequency recursions in a given generation , let the haplotype frequencies in eggs be x 1 = [ a 1 b 1 ] , x 2 = [ a 2 b 1 ] , x 3 = [ a 1 b 2 ] , and x 4 = [ a 2 b 2 ] .
haplotype frequencies in sperm are y 1 = [ a 1 b 1 ] , y 2 = [ a 2 b 1 ] , y 3 = [ a 1 b 2 ] , and y 4 = [ a 2 b 2 ] .
following random mating , females of the next generation will carry a maternally inherited haplotype i = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } and paternally inherited haplotype j = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } with probability xiyj .
males of the next generation inherit a single haplotype i from their mothers , with probability xi. the fitness of a female carrying haplotypes i and j is fij , and the fitness of males carrying haplotype i is mi. haplotype frequencies after selection and recombination , but prior to mutation , are described by the following set of recursion equations : ( 10 ) where f is the sum of the numerators of x 1 ' , x 2 ' , x 3 ' , and x 4 ' ; m is the sum of numerators of y 1 ' , y 2 ' , y 3 ' , and y 4 ' ; and theta = x 1 y 4 f 14 - x 2 y 3 f 23 - x 3 y 2 f 32 + x 4 y 1 f 41 .
for the mutation - selection balance scenario , we consider fitness variation contributed by alleles that are deleterious to both sexes , and arbitrarily assume that a 1 is the deleterious allele .
assuming mutation rates at locus a are much smaller than the strength of selection against a 1 , mutations from a 1 to a 2 can be safely ignored .
the frequency of each haplotype after a single generation , including mutation , will be : ( 11 ) where u is the mutation rate at the a locus , per gamete .
when variation is maintained by sexual antagonism ( that is , a balanced polymorphism is stably maintained ) , recurrent mutation will marginally affect equilibrium allele frequencies at the a locus [ 55 ] .
therefore , the recursion equations from eq .
( 10 ) are sufficient to describe haplotype frequency dynamics under sexual antagonism .
invasion conditions for b2 alleles jacobian matrices were calculated for the two models of genetic variation for fitness ( see text s2 ) , with each model giving rise to a block triangular matrix with two diagonal submatrices ( see [ 46 ] , chapter 12 ) .
in each model , invasion of the b 2 allele is favored when the leading eigenvalue of the jacobian is greater than one ; b 2 cannot invade when the leading eigenvalue is less than one .
one submatrix has leading eigenvalue less than one as a condition of the population initially being fixed for b 1 and at stable equilibrium at the a locus .
stability at b is therefore determined by the leading eigenvalue of the remaining submatrix , j ( see table s1 and text s2 ) .
under the mutation - selection balance model for fitness variation , the characteristic polynomial is : ( 12 ) where the partial derivatives are evaluated from the recursions in eq .
( 11 ) , each evaluated at the equilibrium : = x 1 = 1 - x 2 , = y 1 = 1 - y 2 , and x 3 = x 4 = y 3 = y 4 = 0 , with values of and based on eq .
( 1 ) .
the leading eigenvalue is the largest of the roots of lambda .
under the sexual antagonism model , the characteristic polynomial is : ( 13 ) where partial derivatives are calculated from recursions in eq .
( 10 ) , each evaluated at the equilibrium : = x 1 = 1 - x 2 , = y 1 = 1 - y 2 , and x 3 = x 4 = y 3 = y 4 = 0 , with values of and based on eq .
( 2 ) .
stability criteria ( i.e. , whether the leading eigenvalue was greater or less than zero ) were determined by hand , and leading eigenvalues were obtained numerically by newton - raphson iteration .
autosomal modifier model when the modifier locus , b , is linked to an autosome , the haplotype recursions can again be obtained using similar approaches as described above .
here , the frequency of each haplotype in females will be the same as described above for the specific case of free recombination : r = ( 1 / 2 ) .
haplotype frequencies in males , following selection and meiosis , are modified to : ( 14 ) where m 1 = m 3 , m 2 = m 4 , and m = ( x 1 + x 3 ) m 1 +( x 2 + x 4 ) m 2 .
stability analysis ( invasion opportunities for rare b 2 alleles ) follows the same approach as before , with initial conditions of variation at locus a remaining unchanged .
under the case of variation maintained by sexually antagonistic selection , effects of mutation are ignored ( we set u to zero ) .
the generic characteristic polynomial is : ( 15 ) with the partial derivatives each evaluated at the equilibrium : = x 1 = 1 - x 2 , = y 1 = 1 - y 2 , and x 3 = x 4 = y 3 = y 4 = 0 .
values of and are based on eqs .
( 1 ) or ( 2 ) as appropriate .
supporting information figure s1 the relative strength of selection on a modifier allele .
this example plots the strength of selection for preferential inactivation of the maternal x ( imposed by segregating deleterious alleles ) relative to selection for a paternal x inactivation bias ( imposed by sexually antagonistic alleles ) .
in both cases , the modifier locus is linked to an autosome .
a locus under purifying selection imposes selection on a modifier of strength s ( del ) = lambdadel - 1 , where lambdadel is the leading eigenvalue at the equilibrium with b 1 fixed and a 1 at mutation - selection balance ( eq .
( 1 ) from the main text , with parameters sm = sf , xi 11 = ( 1 / 2 ) , xi 12 = ( 1 / 2 ) - 10 - 3 , h = 0.25 , and u = 10 - 5 ) .
a sexually antagonistic locus imposes selection on a modifier s ( sa ) = lambdasa - 1 , where lambdasa is the leading eigenvalue at the equilibrium with b 1 fixed and a 1 at deterministic balanced polymorphism ( eq .
( 2 ) from the main text , with parameters tm = sf , xi 11 = ( 1 / 2 ) , xi 12 = ( 1 / 2 )+ 10 - 3 , h = 0.25 ) .
the y - axis plots the relative strength of selection imposed by the two types of fitness loci , i.e. , the ratio : s ( del )/ s ( sa ) .

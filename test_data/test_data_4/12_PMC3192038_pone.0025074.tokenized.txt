alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) and mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) are of great current research interest .
while there is no consensus on whether mcis actually " convert " to ad , this concept is widely applied .
thus , the more important question is not whether mcis convert , but what is the best such definition .
we focus on automatic prognostication , nominally using only a baseline brain image , of whether an mci will convert within a multi - year period following the initial clinical visit .
this is not a traditional supervised learning problem since , in adni , there are no definitive labeled conversion examples .
it is not unsupervised , either , since there are ( labeled ) ads and controls , as well as cognitive scores for mcis .
prior works have defined mci subclasses based on whether or not clinical scores significantly change from baseline .
there are concerns with these definitions , however , since , e.g. , most mcis ( and ads ) do not change from a baseline cdr = 0.5 at any subsequent visit in adni , even while physiological changes may be occurring .
these works ignore rich phenotypical information in an mci patient 's brain scan and labeled ad and control examples , in defining conversion .
we propose an innovative definition , wherein an mci is a converter if any of the patient 's brain scans are classified " ad " by a control - ad classifier .
this definition bootstraps design of a second classifier , specifically trained to predict whether or not mcis will convert .
we thus predict whether an ad - control classifier will predict that a patient has ad. our results demonstrate that this definition leads not only to much higher prognostic accuracy than by - cdr conversion , but also to subpopulations more consistent with known ad biomarkers ( including csf markers ) .
we also identify key prognostic brain region biomarkers .
introduction the dementing illness alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) , and the transitional state between normal aging and ad referred to as mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) continue to be widely studied .
individuals diagnosed with mci have memory impairment , yet without meeting dementia criteria .
annually10 - 15 % of people with mci are diagnosed with ad [ 1 ] .
moreover , prior to symptom onset , brain abnormalities have been found in people with mci , as ascertained by retroactive evaluation of longitudinal mri scans [ 2 ] .
there is no consensus on whether mci patients actually " convert " to ad. first , some mci patients may suffer from other neurodegenerative disorders ( e.g. , lewy body dementia , vascular dementia and / or frontotemporal dementia ) .
second , it is possible that all other mci patients already have ad , but at a preclinical stage .
ad diagnosis itself may not be considered definitive without e.g. confirming pathologies such as the amyloid deposits detectable at autopsy .
regardless of whether mci patients truly " convert " to ad or not , the concept of mci - to - ad conversion has been widely applied , e.g. [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] and is utilitarian - defining mci ( converter and nonconverter ) subgroups allows use of statistical group difference tests and machine learning methods to help identify early disease biomarkers and to build models for predicting disease progression .
for these purposes , the more important question is not whether mcis convert , but rather what is the best such definition .
accordingly , here we focus on the following aim : automatic prognostication , ( nominally ) using only a baseline brain scan , of whether an mci individual will convert to ad within a multi - year ( three year ) period following an initial ( baseline ) clinical visit .
our system performs three - year ahead prediction because it is designed based on the adni database , which followed participants for a period of up to three years .
( data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the alzheimer 's disease neuroimaging initiative ( adni ) database adni.loni.ucla.edu .
as such , the investigators within the adni contributed to the design and implementation of adni and / or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report .
a complete listing of adni investigators can be found at : http :// adni.loni.ucla.edu / wp - content / uploads / how _ to _ apply / adni _ authorship _ list.pdf ) .
while only image voxel - based features are evaluated here for use by our classifier , our framework is extensible to incorporating other baseline visit clinical information ( e.g. weight , gender , education level , genetic information , and clinical cognitive scores such as the mini mental state exam ( mmse )) into the decisionmaking .
moreover , our approach can also incorporate the recent , promising cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) based markers [ 8 ] .
however , as this requires an invasive spinal tap , we focus here on image scans , which are routinely performed for subjects with mci .
we do not hypothesize that , within adni , there are actually two subclasses of mci subjects when evaluated over the very long term - those that ( eventually ) convert to ad , and those that do not .
even if an overwhelming majority of mci subjects will eventually convert , identifying the subgroup likely to convert within several years has several compelling utilities : 1 ) early prognosis , to assist family planning ; 2 ) facilitating group - targeted treatments / drug trials ; 3 ) we identify key prognostic brain " biomarker " regions , i.e. those found to be most critical for accurately discriminating our " converter " and " nonconverter " groups .
these regions may shed light on disease etiology .
distinguishing ad converters from nonconverters is a binary ( two - class ) classification problem .
moreover , it may appear this classification problem can be directly addressed via supervised learning methods [ 9 ] .
however , it is in fact an unconventional problem , lying somewhere between supervised classification and unsupervised classification ( clustering ) , and thus requiring a unique approach .
to appreciate this , consider the adni cohort of mci individuals .
adni consists of clinical information and image scans on hundreds of participants , taken at six - month intervals for up to three years .
a clinical label ( ad , mci , or control ) was assigned to each participant at first visit .
clinicians derive the ad / mci / control label based on multiple criteria , which may include clinical dementia rating ( cdr ) , whose possible values are : 0 = none , 0.5 = questionable , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe .
even though a probable ad definition based on cdr and mmse scores and nincds / adrda criteria has been used ( e.g. [ 10 ] , [ 7 ]) to provide follow - up assessment for mci patients , this is strictly a clinically driven definition , based on a clinical rating ( cdr ) and a cognitive score ( mmse ) whose difficulties will be pointed out shortly .
this is not a definitive ( autopsy - based ) determination of ad , nor is it a definition based on physiological brain changes .
even if the probable ad definition has very high specificity , it may not be sufficiently sensitive , i.e. there may be patients who are undergoing significant physiological brain changes consistent with conversion , yet without clinical manifestation .
accordingly , we will approach the conversion problem from a perspective as agnostic and unbiased as possible , and simply state that it is not definitively known which mci participants in adni truly converted to ad within three years .
in conventional supervised classifier learning , one has labeled training examples , used for designing the classifier , and labeled test examples , used to estimate the classifier 's generalization accuracy .
for predicting whether mci participants in adni convert to ad , we in fact have neither .
thus , our problem is not conventional supervised learning .
on the other hand , consider unsupervised clustering [ 9 ] .
here , even if one knows the number of clusters ( classes ) present , there is no prior knowledge on what is a good clustering - one is simply looking for underlying grouping tendency in the data .
clearly , our problem does not fit unsupervised clustering , either - while we have no ground - truth labeled mci converter / nonconverter instances per se , 1 ) there are two designated classes of interest ( converter and nonconverter ) ; and 2 ) there are known class characteristics - conversion to ad should , plausibly , mean that : ( i ) a clinical measure such as cdr or a cognitive measure has changed and / or ( ii ) there are changes in brain region features or in csf biomarkers more characteristic of ad subjects than normal / healthy subjects .
note that in adni we do have plentiful labeled ad and normal / healthy ( control ) examples to help assess ii ) .
based on the above , mci prognosis is an interesting and novel problem , lying somewhere between supervised and unsupervised classification .
the crux of this problem is to craft criteria through which meaningful mci subgroups can be defined , well - capturing notions of " ad converter " and " nonconverter " .
to help guide development and evaluation of candidate definitions , we state the following three desiderata : 1 ) the proposed definition of ad converter should be plausible and should exploit the available , relevant information in the adni database ( e.g. image data , labeled ad and control examples , and clinical information ) .
to appreciate 1 ) , note that the mci population could be dichotomized in many ways , e.g. by height , and there might be significant clustering tendency with respect to height , but such a grouping is likely meaningless for mci prognosis ; 2 ) a classifier trained based on these class definitions should generalize well on test data ( not used for training the classifier ) - this quantifies how accurately we can discriminate the classes that we have defined .
equivalently , it tells us whether the features we are using are adequate for well - discriminating the classes we define .
if we create what we believe to be good definitions , but ones that cannot be accurately discriminated , that would not be useful clinically ; 3 ) the class definitions should be validated using known ad conversion biomarkers ( i.e. , external measures ) such as measured changes from baseline in volumes or final visit volumes of brain regions known to be associated with the disease [ 11 ] , csf biomarkers [ 12 ] , and cognitive test scores ( such as the clinical mmse measure ) .
prior related work several prior works , e.g. [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] , defined converter and nonconverter classes solely according to whether the baseline visit cdr score of rose or stayed the same over all visits .
change in cdr has also been used as surrogate ground - truth for cognitive decline in a number of other papers , e.g. [ 14 ] , [ 6 ] .
while cdr gives a workable conversion definition , it should be evaluated with respect to the three desiderata above .
we will evaluate 2 ) and 3 ) in the sequel. with respect to 1 ) , one should challenge a cdr - based conversion definition .
first , cdr is not an effective discriminator between the ad and mci groups , i.e. there is very significant ad - mci overlap , not only with respect to cdr = 1 but even 0.5 - for adni , the majority of the hundreds of ad subjects used in our experiments start ( at first visit ) at cdr = 0.5 and stay at 0.5 at all later visits ; likewise , nearly all mci subjects start at 0.5 , with a large majority of these also staying at 0.5 for all visits .
this latter fact further implies difficulties in finding an adequate number of conversion - by - cdr subjects in adni , both for accurate classifier training and test set evaluation .
for the even more stringent probable ad definition ( meeting mmse and nincds / adrda criteria , in addition to cdr changing from 0.5 to 1 ) there are necessarily even fewer mci converters for classifier training and testing .
second , a purely cdr - based ( or " probable ad " based ) conversion definition ignores the ( rich ) phenotypical information in an mci subject 's image brain scans and does not exploit the labeled ad and normal / healthy ( control ) examples in adni .
these prior works do treat features derived from brain scans as the covariates ( the inputs ) used by the classifier / predictor .
however , we believe the mci brain scans can themselves be used , in conjunction with the labeled ad and control examples , to help define more accurate surrogate ground - truth .
previous work has demonstrated that structural mri analysis is useful for identifying ad biomarkers in individual brain regions [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] - e.g. , cortical thinning [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , ventricle dilation and gaping [ 14 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] , volumetric and shape changes in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , and temporal lobe shrinkage [ 24 ] .
it is important to capture interaction effects across multiple brain regions [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 13 ] .
did jointly analyze voxels ( or regions ) spanning the entire brain and did build classifiers or predictors .
moreover , as part of their work [ 13 ] , investigated prediction of future decline in mci subjects working from baseline mri scans , which is the primary subject of our current paper .
however , there are several limitations of these past works .
first , all these studies used the previously discussed cdr and cognitive measures such as mmse , which has been described as noisy and unreliable , as the ground - truth prediction targets for classifier / regressor training .
in [ 14 ] , the authors state : " cognitive assessments are notoriously variable over time , and there is increasing evidence that neuroimaging may provide accurate , reproducible measures of brain atrophy. " even in [ 13 ] , where mmse was treated as the measure of decline and the ground - truth regression target , the authors acknowledged that " individual cognitive evaluations are known to be extremely unstable and depend on a number of factors unrelated to ... brain pathology. " such factors include sleep deprivation , depression , other medical conditions , and medications .
even though mmse is widely used by clinicians , these comments ( even if not universally accepted ) , do indicate mmse by itself may not be so reliable in quantifying the disease state .
moreover , while [ 13 ] did build predictors of future mmse scores working from baseline scans , this was not a main focus of their paper - their paper focused on predicting the current score .
their prognostic experiments involved a very small sample size ( just 26 participants from the adni database ) .
accordingly , it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the accuracy of their prognostic model and their associated brain biomarkers .
the main reason the authors chose such a small sample was , as the authors state : " a large part of ... adni ... are from patients who did not display significant cognitive decline ...[ these ] would overwhelm the regression algorithm if. . used in the ... experiment. " while this statement ( with cognitive decline measured according to mmse ) may be true , that does not mean many of those excluded adni subjects are not experiencing significant physiological brain changes / atrophy .
the novel approach we next sketch is well - suited to identifying mci subjects undergoing such changes .
our neuroimaging - driven , trajectory - based approach here , we propose a novel approach for prognosticating putative conversion to ad driven by image - based information ( and exploiting ad - control examples ) , rather than by a single , non - image - based , weakly discriminating clinical measurement such as cdr .
our solution strategy is as follows .
we first build an accurate image - based control - ad classifier ( i.e. , using ad and control subjects , we build a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier ) ( vapnik , 1998 ) .
we then apply this classifier to a training population of mci subjects - separately , for each subject visit , we determine whether the subject 's image is on the ad side or the control side of the svm 's fixed ( hyperplane ) decision boundary .
in addition to a binary decision , the svm gives a " score " - essentially the distance to the classifier 's decision boundary .
thus , for each mci subject , as a function of visits , we get an image - based " phenotypical " score trajectory .
we fit a line to each subject 's trajectory and extend the line to the sixth visit if the sixth visit is missing .
we can then give the following trajectory - based conversion definition : if the extended line either starts on the ad side or crosses to the ad side over the six visits , we declare this person a " converter - by - trajectory " .
otherwise , this person is a " nonconverter - by - trajectory " .
( a very small percentage of the mci population , in our experiments often and not exceeding , may unexpectedly start on the ad side and cross to the control side .
we treat these individuals as outliers and omit them from our experiments. ) in this fashion , we derive ground - truth " converter " and " nonconverter " labels for an ( initially unlabeled ) training mci population .
these ( now ) labeled training samples bootstrap the design of a second svm classifier which uses only the first - visit training set mci images and is trained to predict whether or not an mci patient is a " converter - by - trajectory " .
essentially , this second ( prognostic ) classifier is predicting whether , within three years , an ad - control classifier will predict that a patient has ad. via these two classifier design steps , we thus build a classification system for our ( unconventional ) pattern recognition task .
svms are widely used classifiers whose accuracy is attributed to their maximization of the " margin " , i.e. the smallest distance from any training point to the classification boundary .
since the svm finds a linear discriminant function that maximizes margin , a significant change in score is generally needed to cross from the control side to the ad side , which is thus suggestive of conversion from mci to ad. this is the premise underlying our approach .
the main contributions of our work are : 1 ) a novel machine learning framework for prognostication falling somewhere between traditional supervised and unsupervised learning ; 2 ) a novel image - based prognosticator of mci - to - ad conversion that we will demonstrate to achieve both better generalization accuracy and much higher correlation with known brain region biomarkers and with csf - based markers than the cdr - based approach ; 3 ) identification of the brain regions most critical for accurately discriminating between our " converter " and " nonconverter " groups , via application of margin - based feature selection ( mfe ) [ 26 ] to brain image classification , and demonstration of mfe 's better performance than the well - known rfe method [ 27 ] on this domain .
methods 2.1 subjects and mri data we used - weighted adni images ( data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the alzheimer 's disease neuroimaging initiative ( adni ) database ( adni.loni.ucla.edu )) that have undergone image correction described at the adni website .
adni image correction steps include gradwarp , n3 , and scaling for gradient drift - see www.loni.ucla.edu / adni / data / adni _ data.shtml .
adni aims to recruit and follow 800 research participants in the 55 - 90 age range : approximately 200 elderly controls , 400 people with mci , and 200 people with ad. the number of control , mci , and ad participants in our analysis were 180 , 300 , and 120 , respectively - experiment - specific detailed descriptions will be provided in sec .
3. we processed the - weighted images as described in the supplemental document s1 , producing new images from which we then obtained the features ( next discussed ) used by our statistical classifiers .
2.2 features for classification we chose as features the voxel intensities of a processed ravens image ( we describe our processing of ravens images in the supplemental document s1 ) , a type of " volumetric density " image [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] that has been validated for voxel - based analysis [ 29 ] and applied both to ad e.g. [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] and other studies e.g. [ 32 ]. of particular interest [ 29 ] , supported that voxel - based spm statistical analysis , which we perform herein for comparison with our methods , can be performed on ravens images .
for each of the three processed ravens tissue maps ( gray matter ( gm ) , white matter ( wm ) , and ventricle ) , to reduce complexity for subsequent processing , we obtained a subsample by successively skipping five voxels along each of the three dimensions , and took as feature set the union of the three subsampled maps .
we will also report results for the case of skipping only two voxels , rather than five .
since high - dimensional nonlinear registration ( warping ) of all individuals to a common atlas ( via hammer [ 33 ]) is applied in producing our features , they capture both volumetric and morphometric brain characteristics , which is important since individuals with ad / mci typically exhibit brain atrophy ( affecting both volume and shape ) .
2.3 classification and feature selection for high - dimensional images a challenge in building classifiers for medical images is the relative paucity of available training samples , compared to the huge dimensionality of the voxel space and , thus , to the number of parameters in the classifier model - in general , the number of parameters may grow at least linearly with dimensionality .
in the case of 3d images , this could imply even millions of parameter values ( e.g. one per voxel ) need to be determined , based on a training set of only a few hundred patient examples .
in such cases , classifier overfitting is likely , which can degrade generalization ( test set ) accuracy .
here we will apply a linear discriminant function ( ldf ) classifier with a built - in mechanism to avoid overfitting and with design complexity that scales well with increasing dimensionality - the support vector machine ( svm ) [ 34 ] .
the choice of ldf achieving perfect separation ( no classification errors ) for a given two - class training set is not unique .
the svm , however , is the unique separating ldf that maximizes the margin , i.e. the minimum distance to the classifier decision boundary , over all training samples .
in this sense , the svm maximizes separation of the two classes .
for an svm , unlike a standard ldf , the number of model parameters is bounded by the number of training samples , rather than being controlled by the feature dimensionality .
since the number of samples is the much smaller number for medical image domains , in this way the svm greatly mitigates overfitting .
svms have achieved excellent classification accuracy for numerous scientific and engineering domains , including medical image analysis , [ 26 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 27 ] .
even though svms are effective at mitigating overfitting , generalization accuracy may still be improved in some cases by removing features that contribute little discrimination power .
moreover , even if generalization accuracy monotonically improves with increasing feature dimensionality , high complexity ( both computation and memory storage ) of both classifier design and class decisionmaking may outweigh small gains in accuracy achieved by using a huge number of features .
most importantly here , it is often useful to identify the critical subset of features necessary for achieving accurate classification - these " markers " may shed light on the underlying disease mechanism .
in our case , this will help to identify prognostic brain regions , associated with mci conversion .
unfortunately , there is a huge number of possible feature subsets , with exhaustive subset evaluation practically prohibited even for a modest number of features , , let alone . practical feature selection techniques are thus heuristic , with a large range of tradeoffs between accuracy and complexity [ 35 ] .
" front - end " ( or " filtering ") methods select features prior to classifier training , based on evaluation of discrimination power for individual features or small feature groups .
" wrapper " methods are generally more reliable , interspersing sequential feature selection and classifier design steps , with features sequentially selected to maximize the current subset 's joint discrimination power .
there are also embedded feature selection methods , e.g. for svms , use of - regularization within the svm design optimization [ 36 ] , in order to find " sparse " weight vector solutions , which effectively eliminate many features .
for wrappers , there is greedy forward selection , with " informative " features added , backward elimination , which starts from the full set and removes features , and more complex bidirectional searches .
in our work , due to the high feature dimension , we focus on two backward elimination wrappers that afford practical complexity : i ) the widely used recursive feature elimination algorithm ( rfe ) [ 27 ] , where at each step one removes the feature with least weight magnitude in the svm solution .
rfe has been applied before to ad [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] ; ii ) the recent margin - based feature elimination ( mfe ) algorithm [ 26 ] , which uses the same objective function ( margin ) for feature elimination , one consistent with good generalization , that the svm uses for classifier training [ 34 ] .
mfe was shown in [ 26 ] to outperform rfe [ 27 ] and to achieve results comparable to embedded feature selection for domains with up to 8,000 features ( gene microarray classification ) .
here we will also find that mfe gives better results than rfe .
2.4 an mri - derived alternative to cdr - based mci - to - ad conversion in the introduction , we outlined our two classifier design steps for building an automatic prognosticator for an individual with mci .
in this section , we elaborate on these two steps and give an illustrative example .
our ad - control classifier , used in the first step , is discussed in sec .
2.4.1 , and our second classifier , used to discriminate converter - by - trajectory ( ct ) and nonconverter - by - trajectory ( nt ) classes , is discussed in sec .
2.4.2 .
2.4.1 ad - control classifier for the ad training population , we chose individual ad visit images with a cdr score of at least 1 .
for the control training population , on the other hand , we only chose initial visits , and only those for participants who stayed at cdr = 0 throughout all their visits .
thus , we excluded controls with " questionable dementia " ( i.e. , cdr = 0.5 ) at any visit. by these choices , we sought to exclude outlier examples or even possibly any mislabeled examples , recalling that cdr for the majority of both ad and mci participants is 0.5 throughout all visits .
2.4.2 ct - nt classifier fig. 1 gives an illustrative example of the phenotypical score trajectories for mci subjects , as described in the introduction .
a positive score is on the control side and a negative score is on the ad side - the x - axis represents the ad - control svm 's decision boundary .
score vs. age is plotted , with each line segment a trajectory obtained by linearly fitting an individual 's phenotype scores ( and linearly extrapolating if there are missing visits ) .
nonconverters - by - cdr ( n - cdr ) and converters - by - cdr ( c - cdr ) are illustrated in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .
green and black subjects are those whose fitted trajectory stayed on the control side and ad side , respectively , whereas gray lines are subjects who crossed to the ad side .
thus , by our conversion - by - trajectory definition , the green group is the nonconverters - by - trajectory , and the black and gray groups together are the converters - by - trajectory .
subject counts for these groups are given in the figure legends .
the outlier subjects are shown in orange - there are five , making up less than of the mci cohort .
notice , intriguingly , from the left figure that more than one third of all ( non - orange ) mci patients ( 106 of 298 ) are converters by trajectory and yet nonconverters according to cdr - i.e. , there is a very large percentage of patients for which the two converter definitions disagree , with the neuroimage - based definition indicating disease state changes that are not predicted using the clinical , cdr - based definition .
likewise , an additional of all mci subjects ( 11 of 298 ) " defy " their by - cdr converter label in that they do not reach the ad side of the decision boundary .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0025074.g001 figure 1 ad - control svm score trajectories for mci subjects .
( a ) nonconverters - by - cdr .
( b ) converters - by - cdr .
based on these trajectories , i.e. whether or not the ad side is visited , we derive the ground - truth ' ct ' and ' nt ' labels for all mci subjects .
we then build a ct - nt classifier using as input only the image scans at initial visit .
( for a small percentage of the mci subjects , we did not obtain the patient 's first visit .
however , we did ensure that the visit we took as the " initial visit " had a cdr of 0.5. ) before continuing , we note that the reader may reasonably wonder why , rather than our converter definition and associated two - stage classifier design , we do not simply directly apply the control - ad classifier to an mci 's baseline visit image , and declare the patient a converter if the image is classified " ad " and a nonconverter , otherwise .
there are several answers to this query .
first , there is no longitudinal ground - truth for mci subjects that can be derived for this alternative converter definition .
thus , one cannot evaluate this definition with respect to desideratum 2 ( generalization accuracy ) .
second , recall that our objective is 3 - year ahead prognosis , not diagnosis .
if nearly all of the mci converters do actually convert at first visit , then our by - trajectory conversion definition would in practice be equivalent to this simpler , alternative definition .
we have investigated this : from a population of 284 mcis , there are 159 mci converters - by - trajectory. of these 159 , 105 do in fact convert at first visit ( an ad - control classifier classifies the baseline visit as " ad ") .
but this means that more than one third of mci converters - by - trajectory convert after the first visit , and these converters would be missed by the simpler definition .
essentially , the difference " in practice " between our proposed definition , and one which simply directly applies the control - ad classifier to the baseline visit is quite a few more ( more than one third of the total ) by - trajectory converters .
results and discussion 3.1 introductory overview in this section we will perform 1 ) classification experiments to evaluate conversion - by - trajectory and conversion - by - cdr with respect to desideratum 2 ; 2 ) additional experiments to compare the two definitions with respect to desideratum 3 ; and lastly , 3 ) experiments to identify prognostic brain " biomarker " regions .
it is important to mitigate the potential confounding effect of the subject 's age .
in our classification experiments , we mitigated in two ways : for every classifier training , each training sample in one class was uniquely paired via " age - matching " with a training sample in the other class ( with age separation at most one year ) .
for every linear - kernel svm classifier , we separately adjusted each feature for age prior to classification using linear fitting .
we subtracted the extrapolated line ( computed only using ' control " samples - for the ad - control classifier , these are the samples in the control class and for the ct - nt classifier we computed the line using only the nt samples ) from the feature 's value , for all ( training and test ) samples .
as an aside , we note that , given the subsequent linear svm operation , this linear fitting step is essentially equivalent to simply treating age as an additional feature input to the linear svm classifier .
finally , prior to building classifiers , we normalized feature values to the [ 0,1 ] range , which is suitable for the libsvm software [ 37 ] we used for training svms .
3.2 experiments with voxel - based features the test set ( generalization ) accuracy of the voxel - based ad - control classifier , built using 70 training samples per class , was 0.89 ( 86 of 88 controls , and 16 of 27 ad subjects , were correctly classified. ) this classifier , with high specificity for controls , was then applied to a population of mci subjects to determine the ct and nt subgroups .
3.2.1 classification experiments for the mci population fig. 2 ( a ) shows the sizes of the converter - by - cdr ( c - cdr ) and nonconverter - by - cdr ( n - cdr ) groups within the adni mci cohort for a typical experiment in our work. fig. 2 ( b ) shows the same population broken up as converters - by - trajectory ( ct ) and nonconverters - by - trajectory ( nt ) .
superimposing the two charts , fig. 2 ( c ) illustrates their overlap , where converters by both definitions are accordingly indicated by orange .
since converters - by - cdr are relatively scarce , we used a large majority of them ( , i.e. 39 individuals among the 48 ) for the by - cdr classifier 's training set , with the rest () put into the test set .
we reiterate that a general disadvantage of the by - cdr approach is its scarcity of converter examples - by contrast , a more balanced number of examples is available for by - trajectory training ( at least , rather than , training samples per class , as in fig. 2 ( b )) .
note also that if we were to use a " probable ad " , rather than a by - cdr converter definition , where converters are required to have undergone both cdr and mmse changes , there would necessarily be even fewer converter examples , which makes " probable ad " even less attractive than by - cdr from the standpoint of having an adequate sample for classifier training and testing .
this also raises the possibility of an alternative clinically - based definition , based on a logical or - ing of cdr - based and mmse - based conversions , i.e. where a converter must either have undergone cdr change or mmse changes ( or both ) .
one difficulty here is how to define mmse - based conversion .
in [ 13 ] mmse scores were averaged over all visits in order to reduce noise .
one can accordingly then define mmse - based conversion if a subject 's mmse score , averaged over all visits , falls below a given threshold .
the average mmse score over all mci subjects is 25.85 .
to assess the number of additional cognitive score - based converters one could obtain by considering mmse , we varied a threshold on the average mmse score , evaluating at cutoffs of 24 , 23 , and 22 , and finding that the additional number of converters declared in this way were 55 , 35 , and 22 , respectively .
thus , especially for an mmse cutoff of 24 , one can obtain a significant number of extra converters using mmse in addition to cdr .
however , it is unclear what is in fact a proper choice for the mmse threshold - simply choosing a threshold at 24 because this leads to more converters is somewhat arbitrary , without a strong objective basis .
accordingly , in the sequel , for evaluating clinically - based conversion , we will only experimentally evaluate by - cdr conversion , as used in [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] .
specification of a principled combined cdr and mmse - based conversion definition and validation of such a definition is a good subject for future work .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0025074.g002 figure 2 a population of 298 mci subjects in adni is shown here , broken up according to the two criteria discussed in sec .
3.2.1 : ( a ) by - cdr criterion , ( b ) by - trajectory criterion ; ( c ) overlap shown .
a fair performance comparison between by - trajectory and by - cdr classification requires : 1 ) using the same per - class training set size ( i.e. 39 ) for both by - cdr and by - trajectory training , and 2 ) making the test set sizes the same for both classifiers .
there are several different ways in which the data can be partitioned into training and test sets , consistent with these two conditions : i ) we can perform simple random selection on a class - by - class basis , ensuring only that the two classifiers are given the same training / test set sizes ( but not the same sets ) - note that this means that the training sets for the converter and nonconverter classes of the conversion - by - cdr classifier are randomly selected from the yellow and white regions in fig. 2 ( a ) , respectively , with no consideration of trajectory - based ( i.e. red / white ) labeling illustrated in fig. 2 ( b ) ; ii ) we can make the training sets of the two classifiers identical rather than merely same - sized , as well as make the test sets identical .
this latter approach , though , will have some bias because , in selecting samples for the by - trajectory classifier , we will have to make use of knowledge of the samples' conversion - by - cdr status ( and vice versa for the by - cdr classifier ) .
the first approach , on the other hand , clearly does not have this bias .
as both approaches are valid ways of dealing with by - cdr data limitations , we will compare generalization accuracies of by - cdr and by - trajectory classifiers under both these data selection schemes , respectively , referring to these approaches as " random " and " identical " in the sequel .
our training / test set selection procedure for the " identical approach " is as follows .
for the c - cdr - ct group ( fig. 2 ( c )) , randomly select of the group ( the yellow striped group of size 30 in fig. 3 ( a )) such that a corresponding group within n - cdr ( white portion in fig. 2 ( a )) can be found that is both nt and satisfies age - matching .
this corresponding group is illustrated in fig. 3 ( a ) as the white striped group ( of size 30 ) , placed opposite from the yellow striped area it is paired ( matched ) with .
likewise for the c - cdr - nt group ( fig. 2 ( c )) , randomly select of the group ( the yellow striped group of size 9 in fig. 3 ( a ) such that a corresponding group within n - cdr can be found that is both ct and satisfies age - matching .
this corresponding group is illustrated in fig. 3 ( a ) as the white striped group ( of size 9 ) .
notice by comparing this figure to fig. 2 ( c ) that the two white striped areas are separated by the ct - nt border .
we take the training set - shared by the by - cdr and by - trajectory classifiers - to be precisely the union of these four striped areas .
( for the by - cdr classifier , the class membership of any of these four subsets of the training set is illustrated by the color being yellow or white in fig. 3 ( a ) .
likewise , for the by - trajectory classifier , class membership is illustrated by red or white color in fig. 3 ( b ).) subsequently , we take the test set - shared by the two classifiers - to be the subjects who are neither in 1 ) the training set ( striped areas ) nor in 2 ) the special set of subjects shown in solid gray in fig. 3 ( a ) ( also shown identically in fig. 3 ( b )) .
we exclude this " special set " ( in gray ) from the test set so that all our experiments under the " identical approach " can have a shared , fixed test set ( for fair comparison with each other ) , including , crucially , an experiment that will include this " special set " of samples in the training set. that is , the test set is the tiled areas in fig. 3 ( a ) ( or , identically , in fig. 3 ( b )) .

left : nonconverters ; right : converters .
note above that some random selection is being employed in choosing the training / test sets even in the " identical approach " ( whereas , in the " random approach " the selection is completely random ) .
thus , for both approaches , the accuracy of performance comparison will benefit from averaging accuracy results over multiple training / test split " trials " , where the training and test sets will vary from trial to trial based on the random selection that is built into the data selection procedure ( for both the " random " and " identical " approaches ) .
this essentially amounts to a bootstrap procedure , which aims to work with a finite ( limited ) amount of data and , at the same time , both build accurate models and accurately assess the model 's generalization accuracy [ 38 ] .
results averaged across 10 trials are given in table 1 for a linear - kernel svm ( for generating all classification results herein , including those in table 1 , we used svm classifiers that were built by employing the common approach of bootstrap - based validation for selecting the classifier 's ( trial 's ) hyperparameter values [ 26 ]) ; notation is used to indicate the mean and standard deviation of quantities across the trials , which are shown rounded up. note that by - trajectory 's generalization performance is as high as 0.83 , whereas by - cdr 's generalization performance is very poor - as poor as random guessing ( see 0.5 and 0.56 table values ) - due mainly to poor performance on nonconverters - by - cdr. fig. 3 ( c ) and fig. 3 ( d ) show by - trajectory and by - cdr results , respectively , for one of the 10 trials ( for the " random approach ") , with each bar indicating distance to the classification boundary for an mci subject in a test population of size 88 and nonconverters / converters shown in left / right figures , respectively .
positive / negative distance means nonconverter / converter side of the boundary , respectively .
among the 88 subjects , by - trajectory correctly classified 79 whereas by - cdr correctly classified only 40 .

sample classifier test set selection converters nonconverters overall count accuracy count accuracy accuracy random by - trajectory approach by - cdr identical by - trajectory approach by - cdr recently , similarly poor by - cdr classification performance was also reported in [ 4 ] , where it was found that the majority of ( by - cdr ) nonconverters " had sharply positive spare - ad scores indicating significant atrophy similar to ad patients " .
since the spare - ad score is produced by a classifier that was trained to discriminate control and ad patients [ 32 ] , [ 16 ] , this comment and associated results are consistent both with our conjecture in the introduction and our above histogram results , which suggest that there may be a significant number of patients undergoing physiological brain changes consistent with conversion , yet without clinical manifestation .
the results above indicate that the conversion - by - cdr definition 's two classes are not well - discriminated , and thus , clinical usefulness of this definition for our prognostic aim is expected to be poor .
the much greater generalization accuracy of the by - trajectory definition ( coupled with its inherent plausibility as a conversion definition ) indicates its greater utility .
increasing the by - trajectory image - based feature resolution : in a separate experiment , we evaluated using one of 27 subsamples ( rather than one of 216 subsamples ) , i.e. a 10 - fold increase in the number of ( voxel - based ) features , and found that the by - trajectory generalization accuracy rose to 0.91 in the " random " case .
we then tried building 27 separate by - converter classifiers , one for every 1 / 27th subsample ( thus effectively using the whole 3d image ) , with majority - based voting used to combine the 27 decisions .
this ensemble scheme again achieved 0.91 accuracy , i.e. there was no further accuracy benefit beyond that from a 10 - fold increase in the number of voxel features .
increasing the by - trajectory training set size : note that the converter - by - cdr sample scarcity and class - balancing ( via age - matching ) in the experiments above had the effect of artificially limiting the by - trajectory classifier training set size .
next we investigated how much the generalization accuracy of by - trajectory classification improves when this limitation is removed .
the tiled areas in figures 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) are identical , illustrating that in this new experiment ( fig. 4 and table 2 ) we used the same test set as previously , for fairness of comparison .
however , as indicated by differences in the total striped area between these two charts , we now make the training set much larger than previously .
specifically , for the " identical " case , we used the previous 10 trials but simply augmented a trial 's training set with the two large , previously - excluded gray sets , shown in fig. 3 ( b ) , with size 60 , as these two sets do age - match each other .
the results , averaged across the 10 trials , are given in table 2 .
notice in this figure the now larger per - class training size ( on average rather than ) , and that the random approach uses this size as well .
the by - trajectory results in table 2 indicate that accuracy improved from ( table 1 ) to for the " identical approach " , and modestly worsened for the " random approach " ( from to ) .

sample test set selection converters nonconverters overall count accuracy count accuracy accuracy by - trajectory random identical a definition based on both neuroimaging and clinical change : we now consider a third definition of conversion that combines the first two definitions as follows .
let " converters " consist of individuals who converted either by - trajectory or by - cdr ( non - white areas in fig. 2 ( c )) , with the " nonconverter " class consisting of the remaining mci individuals ( white area ) .
we give two points of view on this new definition , " conversion - by - union " .
first , despite the disadvantages with cdr and mmse pointed out in sections 1 and 2 of this paper , our strictly neuroimaging - based by - trajectory definition is not using any clinical information in defining the phenotype , i.e. psychological effects are not being taken into account .
second , this " union " definition is more inclusive in defining an mci subpopulation at risk , which may benefit from early treatment or diagnostic testing .
while from that perspective the new definition is reasonable , the fact that grouping individuals by cdr has a role in this definition may be its disadvantage , considering that by - cdr classification was previously shown to perform not much better than random guessing .
results , averaged across the same 10 trials used in fig. 3 , are given in table 3 and indicate that conversion - by - union generalizes somewhat worse than conversion - by - trajectory .
note that " by - union " is , by definition , an instance of the " identical approach " .
to ensure fairness of comparison with the by - trajectory definition of conversion , our test sets , and training set sizes , in these two cases were identical .
in fact , we chose the by - union training set to be as similar to by - trajectory 's , in every trial , as possible .
referring to fig. 3 ( b ) ( which represents a trial example ) , the by - union training set was chosen to include 1 ) the two large striped groups ( red and white ) ; 2 ) the small " special " gray group ( of size seven in this trial example ) and its age - matched counterpart within small white - striped group , and ; 3 ) a subset of the second small " special " gray group ( two of five individuals in this trial example ) and its age - matched counterpart within the small red - striped group .
we do not further evaluate " conversion - by - union " here .
we do , however , identify " optimal " definition of a multidimensional phenotype and associated conversion , based on neuroimaging , multiple cognitive measures ( e.g. , cdr and mmse ) , genetic markers , and csf markers ( if routinely measured ) as a good direction for future work .

sample test set selection converters nonconverters overall count accuracy count accuracy accuracy by - union identical 3.2.2 validation on known ad conversion biomarkers to validate the proposed conversion definitions with respect to desideratum 3 , we performed correlation tests on the mci population between the binary class variable and known ad conversion biomarkers consisting of : 1 ) volume in reported ad - affected regions ( table 2 in [ 11 ]) , which we measured for each individual 's final - visit mri ( as discussed in the supplemental document s1 , we measured normalized region volume .
note also that our regions are defined based on the atlas ( atlas2 ) we used .
the correspondence between the regions in [ 11 ] and our defined regions is given in table 4 .
finally , note that a subject 's final visit is not always the sixth visit. ) ; 2 ) the following csf - based markers , as considered previously in [ 12 ] : tau , p - tau , a1 - 42 ; and 3 ) the clinical mmse measure .
the stronger the correlation , the more accurately the biomarker is predicted from the class variable and the greater the separation between the biomarker histograms , conditioned on the two classes .
in particular , we would expect that a good converter definition should have statistically significant correlation between its class variable and region volume at final visit for known marker regions such as the hippocampus .
we note , however , that for measuring correlation between the by - trajectory class label and the final - visit mri - derived region volume biomarkers , some care is required to avoid statistical bias .
in particular , note that the by - trajectory label is obtained by applying the control - ad classifier to each visit 's mri , with conversion declared if any of the visits ( including the final one ) is classified as " ad " .
since the final visit is also used to measure the region volume biomarkers we will use to validate the by - trajectory labels , this " dual use " of the final visit would be a source of bias .
there are 22 mci subjects that by - trajectory convert only at the final visit .
to avoid bias in validating the by - trajectory approach , we excluded these 22 subjects from brain region - volume based statistical validation of the by - trajectory definition .
the full mci population ( including these 22 subjects ) was used in all our other validation testing .

next , we performed comprehensive statistical tests for a number of suggested ad biomarkers .
the r statistical computing package was used to perform all tests with statistical significance set at the 0.05 level .
in table 5a , the correlation coefficients for by - trajectory and by - cdr are shown for each biomarker , along with their associated p - values [ 39 ] .
note that for 10 out of 14 brain regions , the correlation with by - trajectory is greater than the correlation with by - cdr ( in bold ) , with by - trajectory meeting the significance threshold in 9 of these 10 regions .
further , for only two of the remaining four biomarkers - posterior cingulate and the clinical mmse measure - does the correlation with by - cdr meet the significance threshold .
most notably , well - established markers for ad such as the hippocampus , lateral ventricles , and inferior parietal exhibited strong correlation with the by - trajectory definition .
to further assess statistical significance of the comparison between by - trajectory and by - cdr correlations , we performed a correlated correlation test [ 40 ] , the appropriate test given that the same mci sample population ( excepting 22 excluded subjects for the by - trajectory brain region volume tests ) was used in measuring correlations for both by - cdr and by - trajectory .
this test ( table 5b ) reveals that the larger correlation of by - trajectory is statistically significant at the 0.05 level in six brain regions ( in bold ) , most notably the hippocampus , with a very low p - value ( 2.16e - 10 ). by contrast , conversion - by - cdr does not achieve a statistically significant advantage for any of the brain regions , nor with respect to mmse .

statistical testing results for the csf markers are shown in table 6 .
as seen in the table , by - trajectory has larger correlation with tau and a1 - 42 than by - cdr conversion .
moreover , for by - trajectory , these correlations are statistically significant .
however , the correlated correlation test did not indicate that the comparison of correlations reached a statistically significant level .
correlations with p - tau were comparable for the two conversion definitions .

to summarize , testing on both brain region and csf - based markers validates that by - trajectory is more consistent with conversion to ad than the by - cdr definition .
3.2.3 identification of prognostic brain " biomarker " regions in the previous section , we validated conversion definitions using established ( diagnostic ) ad biomarker brain regions ( with volumes measured at final visit ) .
in this section , we will identify key prognostic biomarker brain regions ( from the baseline visit image ) via supervised feature selection , aiming first to identify the " essential " subset of voxel features , i.e. the voxels ( at initial visit ) necessary for our classifier to well - discriminate the ct and nt classes .
the brain regions ( consistent with a registered brain atlas ) within which these select voxels principally reside then identify our prognostic brain biomarker regions .
similarly , we will identify diagnostic regions , critical for discriminating between ad and control subjects ( using our ad - control classifier ) .
in both cases , the accuracy of the selected brain region biomarkers rests heavily on the accuracy of the supervised feature selection algorithm we employ .
in figure 6 , we compare mfe and rfe feature elimination ( i.e. feature selection via feature elimination ) for both control - ad classification and for ct - nt classification ( for one representative , example trial ) .
the curves show test set accuracy as a function of the number of retained features ( which is reduced going from right to left ) .
note that the " mfe / mfe - slack " hybrid method [ 26 ]) outperforms rfe for both brain classification tasks , achieving lower test set error rates , and with much fewer retained features .
the circle , determined without use of the test set based on the rule in [ 26 ] , marks the point at which we stopped eliminating features by mfe , thus determining the ( trial 's ) retained voxel set .
this mfe - rfe comparison ( and the previous comparison in [ 26 ]) supports our use of mfe to determine brain biomarkers .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0025074.g006 figure 6 test set misclassification rate during the course of feature elimination for : ( a ) the ad - control classifier and ( b ) the ct - nt classifier .
to relate the retained voxel set to anatomic regions in the brain , we overlaid the retained voxel set onto a registered atlas space .
for ct - nt classification , to improve robustness , the final voxel set was formed from the union of the retained voxel sets from each of ten feature elimination trials ( each using a different , randomly selected training sample subset ) .
for ad - control classification , the final voxel set came from a single trial ( the only trial , from which the 10 ct - nt trials stemmed ) .
for each of these two cases , overlaying the final voxel set onto the co - registered atlas ( atlas2 , defined in the supplemental document s1 ) yielded between 70 - 80 anatomic regions .
for data interpretation purposes , we then identified a subset of ( biomarker ) regions using the following procedure .
first , for each brain region , we measured the percentage of the region 's voxels that are retained , sorted these percentages , and then plotted them .
as shown in fig. 7 ( a ) , the resulting curve for the ad - control case has a distinct knee , which we thus used as a threshold ( 0.125 ) to select the final , retained ( diagnostic ) regions for ad - control .
we used the same threshold for the ct - nt curve , shown in fig. 7 ( b ) .
this choice of threshold yields a reasonable number of regions - 19 for the ct - nt ( prognostic ) case and 21 for the ad - control ( diagnostic ) case .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0025074.g007 figure 7 sorted retained voxel percentages for initial regions used to select final regions ( sec. 3.2.3 ) : ( a ) ad - control ; b ) ct - nt. the resulting sets of identified prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers are given in table 7 , along with their intersection .
the diagnostic markers in the table include the majority of the known brain regions in the medial temporal lobe involved in ad pathology .
for example , hippocampus atrophy and lateral ventricle enlargement , particularly in its anterior aspects of the temporal horn , are considered the most prominent diagnostic markers for ad. entorhinal cortical regions , including the perirhinal cortex , are presumably the earliest sites of degeneration [ 41 ] .
thus , independent identification by our ad - control classifier of known ad diagnostic biomarkers establishes a reasonable basis for applying the same approach to identify prognostic biomarkers .
the brain regions listed as ct - nt prognostic markers include most known ad diagnostic markers ( including 8 of the 12 regions from [ 11 ] ( marked by *) , 4 of which are also diagnostic markers ) , indicating that some ad - linked pathological changes in these brain regions already occurred and remained active in a subset of mci subjects who likely progress to ad rapidly .
conversely , the brain areas appearing only on the prognostic marker list are likely the most active areas of degeneration during this stage of progression to dementia .
these structures tend to be the brain regions further away from the entorhinal cortex onto the parietal ( supramarginal gyrus , precuneus ) and temporal cortex ( superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus ) regions .
all the brain structures listed in the table are known to be involved in ad [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
thus , the markers in table 7 suggest an interesting anatomic pattern of trajectory for mci conversion to ad which conforms with the brak and brak hypothesis and previous imaging findings [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
moreover , the ct - nt regions uniquely found by our mfe - based procedure in table 7 may be viewed as " putative " prognostic markers , and may warrant further investigation .

while our identified regions are plausible , it is possible that other ( equally plausible ) criteria may produce different biomarker region results .
thus , the biomarkers we identify should be viewed as anecdotal , identifying regions that figure prominently in our classifier 's decisionmaking and also potentially assisting researchers in forming hypotheses about mci - to - ad disease progression .
however , we do not view the identified regions as definitive .
3.2.4 comparison with an spm - based biomarker identification approach in the previous section , we used mfe to identify voxels as biomarkers for the ct and nt classes .
here , using the same ct - nt training and test populations , we will alternatively identify voxel - based biomarkers using statistical testing with spm5 ( see : [ 44 ]) .
subsequently we will present a classifier generalization accuracy comparison ( where accuracy is again measured on the previous section 's ct - nt ( test ) population ) for these two biomarker detection methods .
we determined spm biomarkers as follows .
the ct - nt training set population , being age - matched , is readily suitable for a paired t - test , an appropriate statistical test for determining spm - identified biomarkers , i.e. voxels that discriminate between the ct and nt groups .
in contrast with mfe 's use of only one ( out of 216 ) ravens subsamples ( taken jointly from the gm , wm , ventricle maps ) , we performed t - tests on whole ravens maps ( without subsampling ) , which makes the spm - mfe comparison favorably biased towards spm .
more specifically our steps were as follows .
first , for the gm and wm maps separately , we found using spm that a large portion of each of these two tissues was statistically significant at the 0.05 level when correction for multiple comparisons was not applied .
next , we used spm 's fdr - based correction for multiple comparisons - based on an spm fdr cluster size of 5 voxels we found that the spatial extent of the statistically significant regions , at each of the levels 0.05 , 0.01 , and 0.005 , was approximately a subset of the above - mentioned spatial support found in the uncorrected case .
given that the number of significant voxels in any of these spm experiments is , again due to no subsampling , much larger than the 11,293 voxels started from in the mfe case , we simply 1 ) chose as our spm result the result for 0.01 ( fdr - corrected ) , 2 ) took from among those significant voxels the most significant 11,434 voxels in order to be able to compare mfe and spm forthe same number of voxels ( biomarkers ) .
to obtain the generalization accuracy for this spm - identified biomarker voxel set , using the same training / test set as in the mfe experiment , we trained an svm classifier and measured its generalization accuracy , which was found to be 0.76 .
this accuracy is somewhat lower than the 0.8 accuracy of the previous section 's ct - nt svm classifier .
recalling that this comparison is actually favorably biased towards spm , and further noticing the fact that mfe was able to maintain the 0.8 accuracy all the way down to 2000 features ( cf. fig. 6 ( b )) , this experimental comparison provides another validation ( beyond the comparison with rfe given earlier ) for mfe - based feature / biomarker selection , applied to brain images .
conclusions we have presented an automated prognosticator of mci - to - ad conversion based on brain morphometry derived from high resolution adni mr images .
the primary novel contributions of our work are : i ) casting mci prognostication as a novel machine learning problem lying somewhere between supervised and unsupervised learning ; ii ) our proposal of a conversion definition which , unlike previous methods , exploits both rich phenotypical information in neuroimages and ad and control examples ; iii ) correlation testing and classifier accuracy evaluations to validate candidate conversion definitions ; iv ) prognostic brain region biomarker discovery based on our conversion definition .
we demonstrated that our method achieved both better generalization accuracy and stronger , statistically significant , correlations with known brain region biomarkers than a predictor based on the clinical cdr score , the approach used in several past works .
our method also achieved higher correlation with csf markers than cdr - based conversion .
the brain structures identified as ad - control diagnostic markers and mci conversion prognostic markers well conform with known brain atrophic patterns and progression trajectories occurring in ad - afflicted brains .
while the noisy nature of cognitive assessments , including mmse , has been acknowledged in past works , in future , in order to exploit all relevant information sources , we will aim to extend our methodology to consider multiple cognitive assessment measures , both potentially as additional ( baseline ) input features and as additional phenotypical prediction targets to our " conversion - by - trajectory " labels .
we may also consider alternative ways to adjust for confounding effects of age , noting that [ 11 ] has characterized the nonlinear dependence of age on brain region volumes .
while we have focused on the mci subpopulation here , our system could also potentially be used to detect , as possible misdiagnoses , subjects diagnosed as " control " who are classified as mci converters by our system .
finally , we may consider the important , allied problem of control - to - mci prognostication .

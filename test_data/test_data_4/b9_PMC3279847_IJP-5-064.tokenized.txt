accidental infection with animal filarial worms in humans is a dilemma for clinicians and parasitologists throughout the world .
to date a variety of such rare parasitoses have been reported mostly in tropics and subtropics .
human dirofilariasis is among those unusual zoonotic infections that occasionally have been observed in the eye and in subcutaneous areas exhibiting with nodule formation .
filarial worms are transmitted to humans through invertebrate biological vectors such as certain species of mosquitoes .
the present report describes a peculiar case of ocular dirofilariasis in a 49 - year - old man resident in iran .
dirofilariasis ocular human case report iran introduction the genus dirofilaria belongs to the family onchocercidae and subfamily dirofilariinae of the order spirurida ( 1 ) .
it can infect dogs and other mammals , including cats , foxes , sea lions , wolves , and otters ( 2 ) .
dirofilaria sp. known as a mosquito transmitted filarial nematode of domestic and wild carnivores occasionally may infect humans as an accidental zoonotic infection .
insects ingest microfilariae from the definitive host and the larvae become mature through two molts within the insect .
the l3 stage is the infective filariform responsible to develop an infection in vertebrate hosts through the mosquito blood meal ( 3 ) .
based on the absence or presence of external longitudinal cuticular ridges , two subgenera of d. dirofilaria and d. nuchtiella are well - recognized ( 4 ). d. nochtiella repens , which sometimes occurs in the conjunctiva of humans in the old world and d. tenuis with similar status in the southern united states formerly was mentioned as d. conjunctiva ( 5 ). from the perspective of ophthalmology however , documented dirofilariasis has been observed in the eyelid , periorbital region , subconjunctival tissues ( 6 ) and rarely in intravitreal region ( 7 ) .
initially , the presence of so - called dog heartworm , d. immitis in the right heart of a dog was stated by francesco birago in river valley of italy in 16268 .
however , the first report of human occurrence was in gastrosplenic ligament of a hungarian woman in 1879 ( 9 ) .
ever since , in parallel with quick development in common knowledge , fast global growing of communication and greater awareness in the medical community , the number of dirofila infections have been increased globally ( 10 ) .
there are also several documented reports of ophthalmic infections worldwide including america , europe , and australia ( 11 ) .
eosinophilic meningitis in human has also attributed to these filarial nematodes as etiological agent diagnosed by immunofluorescence and arthus hypersensitivity ( 12 ) .
inclusively several clinical cases of human dirofilariasis , including 270 pulmonary cases have been reported up to the end of the second millennium ( 13 ) .
case report a 49 - year - old iranian man , resident in tehran , iran of a good socio - economic level was primarily referred to an ophthalmologist with redness , tearing , blepharospasm , swelling of lids , photophobia , and cystic swelling on the temporal side of bulbar conjunctiva of right eye .
betamethasone eye drop was prescribed 4 times daily as the case was diagnosed allergic conjunctivitis .
three days later , patient referred to farabi eye hospital ; with severe manifestations .
ocular examination showed palpebral swelling with hyperemia and swelling directly over the lateral rectus muscle insertion with congestion of episcleral vessels .
the cornea at temporal side was slightly opaque , anterior chamber , lens vitreous and retina was unremarkable .
visual acuity and iop was normal .
diagnosis and treatment of episcleritis was done .
one - month later patient came back to the hospital exhibiting a hard u shape granulated tissue at the lesion site ( fig. 1 ) , without any remarkable disorder in his eye .
the lesion was explored under local anesthesia and after incision of granuloma a 1.5 cm. white roundworm was extracted from area and was sent to parasitology department for diagnosis. fig. 1 dirofilaria repens lying within sclera forming u shape granuloma ( source : authors ) specimen identification extracted worm was recognized as immature d. repens of 18 mm length and 280 - microm width .
identification was conducted using authentic diagnostic clues ( 4 ) based upon the morphological appearance completed with observing longitudinal cuticular ridges in cross sections .
due to unwilling extra manipulation and staining processes , the best typical taxonomic feature was not attained successfully as it could be obviously illustrated .
however , it was not so hard to browse for pieces of longitudinal cuticular ridges among the slide sections to confirm differentiation of d. repens from d. immitis confidently ( fig. 2 ). fig. 2 cross section showing longitudinal ridges indicating dirofilaria repens ( 40x ) ( source : authors ) discussion to date , 12 confirmed cases of human dirofilariasis have been reported in iran , scattered across 11 provinces .
three ( a case of testicular hydrocele and two pulmonary cases ) have been attributed to d. immitis and the rest ( four subcutaneous , two ocular and three subconjunctival cases ) to d. repens ( 14 , 15 ) .
there have also been two possible cases : the individual , with an ocular problem possibly caused by d. conjunctivae ( 16 ) , and a patient with a swollen right forearm , possibly caused by d. repens ( 17 ) .
meanwhile dirofilariasis in carnivores have been documented so far in iran ( 18 ) .
in a recent publication , prevalence of this zoonotic filarial worm among those red foxes and jackals with proximity to human residing areas has posed the importance of this issue ( 19 ) .
because of the free roaming behavior of definitive hosts , the main source of infection looks available for mosquitoes such as culicidae members .
in contrast with many parasitic infections in humans , dirofilariasis seems hardly in relation with personal hygienic conditions when the biology of culicidae vectors is considered in many parts of the world .
this is also can be claimed that the rate of human dirofilariasis might be more than the present rate in the literature .
notable occurrences of ocular dirofilariasis within the entire records in iran will drag the mind toward a great need of comprehensives investigation on the parasite eco biological traits itself , and the factors contributing in human transmission .

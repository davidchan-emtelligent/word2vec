background amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) is a life - threatening neurodegenerative disease involving upper and lower motor neurons loss .
clinical features are highly variable among patients and there are currently few known disease - modifying factors underlying this heterogeneity .
serotonin is involved in a range of functions altered in als , including motor neuron excitability and energy metabolism .
however , whether serotoninergic activity represents a disease modifier of als natural history remains unknown .
methodology platelet and plasma unconjugated concentrations of serotonin and plasma 5 - hiaa , the major serotonin metabolite , levels were measured using hplc with coulometric detection in a cohort of 85 patients with als all followed - up until death and compared to a control group of 29 subjects .
principal findings platelet serotonin levels were significantly decreased in als patients .
platelet serotonin levels did not correlate with disease duration but were positively correlated with survival of the patients .
univariate cox model analysis showed a 57 % decreased risk of death for patients with platelet serotonin levels in the normal range relative to patients with abnormally low platelet serotonin ( p = 0.0195 ) .
this protective effect remained significant after adjustment with age , gender or site of onset in multivariate analysis .
plasma unconjugated serotonin and 5 - hiaa levels were unchanged in als patients compared to controls and did not correlate with clinical parameters .
conclusions / significance the positive correlation between platelet serotonin levels and survival strongly suggests that serotonin influences the course of als disease .
introduction amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting both lower motor neurons ( lmn ) and upper motor neurons ( umn ) , and leads to death within 2 to 5 years of onset .
clinical features and progression are highly heterogeneous among patients ( for review see [ 1 ]) .
there are currently few identified disease - modifying factors accounting for this heterogeneity .
among these , energy metabolism abnormalities have been shown in als patients [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] and their potential contribution to the course of the disease has been stressed [ 6 ] , but little is known about the factors triggering these abnormalities .
the neurotransmitter serotonin is involved in a range of functions altered in als , including motor neuron excitability and energy metabolism ( reviewed in [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ]) .
early studies on very limited numbers of patients suggested that the levels of serotonin and its metabolite are decreased in brain tissues of als patient 's post - mortem [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
moreover , recent imaging studies have shown decreased binding of serotonin 1a ( 5 - ht1a ) ligands in als raphe and cortex [ 13 ] .
however , definite evidence that serotonin itself is modified in als is lacking and whether serotonergic activity is a disease modifier of als natural history remains unknown .
since serotonergic neurons and platelets express similar serotonin related enzymes and receptor , alterations in central serotonin are likely to be reflected in platelet serotonin levels [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
in this study we aimed to study the relationships between circulating serotonin and survival in a cohort of als patients .
results decreased platelet serotonin levels in als patients the demographic data of als patients ( table 1 ) are in close accordance with previous reports thus showing that the patients included in the present study are representative of the als population .
age and sex ratio of als and control groups did not differ ( table 1 ) .
levels of platelet serotonin were significantly lower in als patients ( median [ range ] ng / ml : 78.4 [ 5.2 - 232.1 ]) as compared to controls ( median [ range ] ng / ml : 110.6 [ 41.4 - 239.6 ] , p = 0.0003 ) with a global 30 % decrease in als patients ( table 2 ) .
normal values of the laboratory range from 60 to 200 ng / ml ( n = 69 patients ) [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
compared to normal value of the laboratory , 31 % of als patients displayed values below the normal range , as compared to 6 % of controls .
plasma unconjugated serotonin and 5 - hiaa remained unchanged .
the decreased platelet serotonin levels were found in patients with either bulbar or spinal onset ( table 3 ) .
levels of plasma unconjugated serotonin were decreased in bulbar , but not in spinal onset patients compared to controls ( table 3 ) .
5 - hiaa plasma levels were similar in controls and in patients whatever was the site of onset , and the molar ratio between 5 - hiaa and platelet serotonin ( an index of mao - a activity ) was significantly increased in als patients compared to matched controls ( table 2 ) , and this was mostly due to bulbar onset patients .
this difference between bulbar and spinal onset patients was not due to a difference in nutritional status between these two groups since bmi did not differ significantly ( bulbar onset patients : 24.6 +/ - 3.5 ; spinal onset patients : 24.7 +/ - 3.4 ; p > 0.05 ) .

decreased platelet serotonin is predictive of worsened survival of als patients there was a significant decrease of platelet serotonin with increasing age at blood sampling in als patients ( r squared = 0.053 , p = 0.0365 ) but not in controls ( r squared = 0.004825 , p = 0.72 ) .
in the als patients group , there was no relationship of platelet serotonin with the length of disease prior to sampling ( r squared = 0.016324 p = 0.2527 ) .
platelet serotonin levels showed no correlation with either site of onset , sex , norris score slopes , initial bmi or rate of bmi loss .
neither plasma serotonin nor 5 - hiaa levels correlated with any of the clinical parameters .
overall median survival , calculated from time of sampling to death , was 34 months [ range : 1 - 149 ] .
univariate cox model analysis of survival showed a significant increase of risk of death with increasing age ( cox model , rr [ 95 % ci ] ( per year ) = 1.028 [ 1.004 - 1.055 ] , p = 0.0210 ) and significant decrease of the risk of death with increasing platelet serotonin levels ( cox model , rr [ 95 % ci ] ( per ng / ml ) = 0.994 [ 0.989 - 0.999 ] , p = 0.0195 ) .
we broke down patient population in 3 groups according to platelet serotonin levels .
values were considered as in a high normal range when superior to 100 ng / ml ( i.e. approximately the mean of controls ) , in an abnormal low range when inferior to 50 ng / ml , and in a borderline range between 50 and 100 ng / ml. this analysis showed a good linearity of the platelet serotonin levels on survival ( figure 1 ) .
patients in the high normal values range showed a 57 % decreased risk of death relative to the abnormal low values range and 35 % relative to the borderline one ( p = 0.023 by the log - rank test , figure ) .
platelet serotonin remained a significant independent predictor of survival following adjustment on known prognostic variables such as age , or site of onset or gender ( rr [ 95 % ci ] ( per ng / ml ) = 0.995 [ 0.990 - 0.999 ] , p = 0.046 ; rr [ 95 % ci ] ( per ng / ml ) = 0.984 [ 0.989 - 0.999 ] , p = 0.020 and rr [ 95 % ci ] ( per ng / ml ) = 0.995 [ 0.989 - 0.999 ] , p = 0.026 respectively ) .

the black line represents patients with als having abnormal serotonin values ( serotonin < 50 ng / ml , n = 22 patients ) ; light grey line represents patients with high normal values ( serotonin > 100 ng / ml i.e. median of control group , n = 25 patients ) , and light black line patients with borderline values ( 50 - 100 ng / ml , n = 35 patients ) .
group comparison shows a statistically significant difference ( p = 0.024 by the log - rank ) .
discussion our study provides two important results , ( i ) platelet serotonin levels are significantly decreased in als patients relative to matched controls , and ( ii ) platelet serotonin level is a significant predictor of survival independent of age .
we first show that platelet serotonin levels are globally decreased in als patients , with about one third of als patients displaying levels of platelet serotonin below the normal range .
platelets are usually considered as an easily accessible model of central serotonergic neurons due to similarities in enzymatic and receptor equipments [ 14 ] , [ 16 ] .
thus , the decreased platelet serotonin levels could mirror what has been reported in als patients , i.e. , a spinal cord decrease in both serotonin and its metabolite as well as a decreased binding of 5 - ht1a ligand in the brain [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
patients with bulbar onset displayed a more profound impairment of the serotonergic system since plasma unconjugated serotonin levels were also decreased in this population , in contrast with patients with spinal onset .
this is in line with a more pronounced loss of cortical 5 - ht1a binding observed in bulbar onset patients [ 13 ] .
the causes of serotonin decrease remain elusive .
number of neurologic and psychiatric conditions , including alzheimer 's disease [ 19 ] , are associated with decreases of the serotonergic system either centrally or in platelets or both .
a similar decrease in serotonin has been described in frontotemporal dementia [ 20 ] , which is now thought to form a continuum with als [ 21 ] .
platelet serotonin decrease was also found in depression , although to a lesser extent [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] and in violent suicide attempters [ 24 ] .
consistent with a pathogenic role of serotonin decrease in als , number of studies showed that depression in als worsens disease severity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
in all , our current study supports the existence of a marked impairment of the serotonergic system in a significant proportion of als patients .
it should be pointed out that decreased levels of platelet serotonin have been reported in many different pathological or debilitating conditions , notably in psychiatric and neurologic diseases , and thus platelet serotonin levels in als , as observed decreased here , should not be considered as a specific biomarker of als .
another limitation of our study is that serotonin levels were assayed in blood , at one single time point .
future studies should be longitudinal and measure brain - derived serotonin in the csf .
the second major result of this study is that platelet serotonin levels correlated positively with survival , as calculated from time of sampling to death .
numbers of studies have shown that serotonin levels drop with age [ 28 ] .
since age is a known modifier of als survival , [ 29 ] it was critical to determine whether the observed correlation was related to age and not to the disease process .
in our study , platelet serotonin did not correlate with age in controls .
this is likely to be due to the relatively narrow age range of patients , since the most important variations of serotonin with age occur in the first two decades of life [ 30 ] .
in the als population , after adjustment with age in a multivariate cox model , platelet serotonin remained a significant predictor of survival , thus showing that the correlation between platelet serotonin and survival unlikely results from an effect of age on platelet serotonin levels .
another potential confounding factor in studies with serotonin is drug interactions .
the observed correlations were not due to such drug interactions since patients taking serotonin reuptake inhibitors , antidepressants or any other serotonin related medications were excluded from the study .
it should be noted that in this study , serotonin was measured at one single time point , when disease had already been diagnosed .
thus , serotonin decrease might be either preexisting disease onset and be associated with an intrinsic variation in serotonin metabolism , or be the consequence of the disease process itself .
the observed positive correlation might , in this latter case be due to an upstream mechanism able to modify both als course and serotonin levels .
in this case , serotonin decrease would be a surrogate marker of a crucial , still unknown , pathogenic event .
in the current absence of longitudinal studies or of genetic studies on serotonin - related genes , it remains impossible to discriminate between these two hypothesis .
previous research in animal models of als however supports that serotonin might directly modulate onset and survival in als .
the administration of serotonin precursor 5 - hydroxytryptophan delayed onset and mortality in a transgenic mice als model [ 31 ] .
the mechanisms underlying the potential protection by serotonin in als clearly deserve further investigation .
it seems unlikely that the potential positive effect of serotonin on survival is related to the excitatory action on motor neurons [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 32 ] since increased serotonin potentially exacerbates a glutamate - evoked excitotoxicity [ 9 ] .
a more attractive hypothesis is a relationship between serotonin and energy metabolism .
serotonin modulates energy homeostasis through complex and still incompletely characterized mechanisms [ 33 ] .
a large number of als patients as well as transgenic als mice show increased energy expenditure [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 34 ] , a phenotype which appears analogous to the effects of a chronic depletion in brain - derived serotonin [ 35 ] .
future studies should focus on the potential relationships between serotonin and energy metabolism in als. whether serotonin directly modulates disease course or constitute a surrogate marker of another crucial pathogenic event , our results show that platelet serotonin correlates with survival in als .
to our knowledge , few biological factors have been demonstrated to be associated with survival in als .
among them are the increase of ldl / hdl ratio [ 6 ] , of plasma apoe [ 36 ] , the polymorphisms in the kifap3 gene [ 37 ] or more recently csf glial markers [ 38 ] .
in the current state of knowledge , our results do not indicate that serotonin replacement therapy could be useful for patients , but rather that investigations focused on the serotonergic system in als are warranted .
materials and methods ethics statement patients were informed of the aim of this non - interventional research and gave their written informed consent .
the institutional review board of salpetriere hospital approved the research .
control patients gave their written informed consent for participating in this study .
patients blood samples were collected from 90 patients followed at the pitie salpetriere hospital ( paris , france ) between 1994 and 1995 .
all patients met the el escorial world federation of neurology criteria for the diagnosis of definite or probable als at the time of blood sampling .
patients underwent blood sampling after diagnosis and before riluzole treatment .
control samples were collected from 11 healthy volunteers and 18 patients hospitalized for orthopaedic surgery .
there was no difference in any of the measured parameters between healthy volunteers and orthopaedic patients and they were thus considered as a single control group .
controls were age and sex matched and medical examinations excluded neurodegenerative , inflammatory , psychiatric ( in particular depression and food intake disorders , such as anorexia ) or neoplasic disorders of the nervous system .
all blood samples were taken as a part of routine laboratory evaluations and were collected after a 12 h fasting period , with care taken to avoid possible medications and possible diets and dietary problems known to interfere with serotonin levels .
for controls undergoing orthopaedic surgery , blood samples were taken before any surgery to avoid for the potential biases due to surgery or immobilization .
all individuals included in the study , either patients or controls , did not used serotonin reuptake inhibitors or any medication with known interaction with serotonin ( e.g. antidepressants ) .
death was documented by death certificate or written letter from relatives or physicians .
documented time of death was obtained for all patients but 5 who were lost to follow - up and had no information after sampling visit .
database was closed at 1st october 2009 and these 5 patients were excluded from the study .
survival was defined as time from blood sampling to death .
disease duration was calculated as the time interval between first symptoms and blood sampling .
these values were calculated in months .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated at each visit and bmi loss was calculated using a linear regression model .
bulbar and limbs norris scale scores were assessed at sampling visit and at each subsequent visit .
biochemical procedures circulating serotonin was measured in serum ; while plasma unconjugated serotonin and 5 - hiaa levels were measured in plasma .
platelet serotonin , which corresponds to about 98 % of total circulating serotonin , was calculated as the difference between circulating and plasma unconjugated serotonin concentrations .
the molar ratio between platelet serotonin and 5 - hiaa levels was calculated and used as an indirect index of mao - a activity .
all the patients and the control subjects fasted overnight .
samples of blood were drawn from the anterocubital vein between 7am and 10am .
five millilitres of blood were collected into vacutainer tubes with no additive for circulating 5 - ht , with citrate for plasma unconjugated serotonin and with dry heparin for plasma 5 - hiaa levels .
serum and plasma were separated by centrifugation at 3000 g and stored at - 80degreesc until further analysis without additional thawing .
the results were unrelated to storing time .
the three parameters were determined within 6 months after blood sampling by high - performance liquid chromatography with coulometric detection according to three different analytical procedures previously described [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
the minimum quantifiable level of serotonin was 0.05 ng / ml in plasma and serum .
the day - to - day variations were 2.0 % , 3.0 % and 2.7 % for 25 , 100 and 300 ng / ml respectively ( n = 8 ) for serum serotonin and 8.6 % , 7.0 % and 5.6 % for 0.5 , 5 and 10 ng / ml plasma serotonin levels ( n = 8 ) .
for plasma 5 - hiaa assays , the minimum quantifiable level was 1 ng / ml with the day - to - day coefficient of variation of 14 % and 11.2 % for 6 and 21 ng / ml ( n = 10 ) respectively .
statistical analysis data are expressed as mean +/ - sd and / or median [ range ] .
based on normal values of the laboratory ( mean [ 95 % ci ] : 92.7 [ 83.4 - 101.9 ] ng / ml ) [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] we calculated that we could detect at least a 26 % change in patients ( n = 85 ) as compared to controls ( n = 29 ) with 81 % power and p - alpha ( 2 - tailed ) = 0.05 , by the t test .
for group comparisons ( als vs. controls ) , we performed non - parametric mann - whitney tests .
for comparisons of three groups ( control vs. als patients with spinal onset or bulbar onset ) , we used kruskal wallis tests .
correlations were performed using the nonparametric spearman 's rank correlation test .
univariate and multivariate cox model analysis were performed to assess the effects of candidate variables on survival .
to assess the linearity of platelet serotonin levels on survival , patient population was broken - down in 3 groups according to ( i ) high normal values ( cut - off > median of control group = 100 ng / ml i.e. circa 550 nm , 25 patients ) , ( ii ) abnormal low values ( cut - off below the normal range < 50 ng / ml i.e. circa 280 nm , 22 patients ) and ( iii ) borderline values ( 50 - 100 ng / ml , 35 patients ) .
survival curves for the three groups were compared by the mantel cox ( log rank ) statistic .
data were analysed using jmp software ( version 8.0 ; sas institute inc. , cary , nc ) , and statistical threshold for statistical significance set at p ( alpha 2 - tailed ) < 0.05 .

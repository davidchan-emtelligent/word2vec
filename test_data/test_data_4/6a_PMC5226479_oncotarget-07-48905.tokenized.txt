as a new subtype of breast cancer , molecular apocrine breast cancer ( mabc ) is estrogen receptor ( er ) and progesterone receptor ( pr ) negative expression , but androgen receptor ( ar ) positive expression .
the prognostic significance and clinical biological behavior of mabc have remained unclear up to now .
this study aimed to analysis the distant metastasis behavior and response to adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy of mabc subgroup .
the report showed that there were significant differences between early and late distant metastasizing tumors with respect to ki67 , epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) expressions by a retrospective analysis consisting of 410 invasive breast cancer patients , which included 205 mabc and 205 nonmabc cases .
mabc subgroup metastasized earlier than nonmabc subgroup , and mabc showed a tendency for a higher metastasis rate in lung , liver and brain , but lower in bone .
her2 - positive or vegf - positive tumors were more inclined to develop bone metastasis within mabc subgroup .
the survival rate was superior for patients undergone both adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy than those undergone chemotherapy alone in nonmabc subgroup , but there was no significant difference in mabc subgroup .
our data suggested that mabc subgroup seemed to develop distant metastasis earlier than nonmabc subgroup , and patients with mabc indicated poor prognosis .
this study might also provide a foundation for helping patients receive reasonable treatments according to molecular subtype .
androgen receptor distant metastasis molecular apocrine breast cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy survival rate pathology section introduction in addition to estrogen receptor ( er ) and progesterone receptor ( pr ) , there is obvious evidence that the androgen signaling pathway may also play a critical role in breast cancer [ 1 , 2 ] .
depending on the breast cancer molecular subtype , androgen receptor ( ar ) and androgen signaling may have either tumor suppressive or oncogenic role on breast cancer growth .
the association between ar expression and favorable outcome in er positive breast cancer had been verified in various studies [ 3 , 4 ] .
tsang et al [ 5 ] showed that in er positive breast cancers , ar expression was associated with a lower grade disease and a better prognosis , whereas in er negative breast cancers , ar appeared to be capable of mediating proliferation and thus acting an oncogenic driver .
however , the role of ar expression in er negative breast cancer has not reached consensus up to now .
in 2005 , farmer et al [ 6 ] named er negative and ar positive tumors as molecular apocrine breast cancer ( mabc ) , while these lesions did not meet the strict histopathological criteria for diagnosis as classical apocrine carcinomas .
then in 2013 , lehmann - che et al [ 7 ] initially confirmed a group of breast cancer samples by a molecular apocrine qrt - pcr signature and then performed immunohistochemistry , and they reported that only 4 morphological apocrine tumors among 58 molecular apocrine cases , which suggested that mabc subgroup could in fact be much broader than initially reported by farmer et al. in 2014 , lakis 's [ 8 ] study subtyped tumors into luminal , molecular apocrine ( er - / pr - / ar +) and receptor - negative , and it had proved that ar - related subtype of breast cancer might be prognostic and serve for selecting optimal treatment combinations .
however , cha et al [ 9 ] found that there were no significant differences in patient prognosis between mabc and other types of breast cancer .
therefore , the prognostic significance and clinical biological behavior of mabc were needed to be better understood .
although the primary tumor growth can be prevented by surgery , adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy , most breast cancer deaths are usually related to distant organ metastasis which is not very effective in preventing , even more is considered to be essentially incurable .
as breast cancer causes mortality mainly by metastasizing to a variety of vital organs , such as bone , lung , brain and liver , it is always characterized by heterogeneity .
furthermore , the metastatic spread of breast cancer is often organ - specificity [ 10 ] .
thus the probability to assess the metastasis organs for different breast cancer molecular subtypes is quite useful in the treatment .
however , this has not been well defined yet .
therefore , in the current study , we emphasized analyzing the characteristics of a unique breast cancer molecular subgroup , mabc , which is characterized by er and pr negative , but ar positive .
to achieve this , the distant metastasis behavior and response to adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy were investigated in patients with mabc and nonmabc .
it was hypothesized that the results may assess the organ of metastasis in the development of mabc .
additionally , this study aimed to identify reasonable treatments that may be useful to improve breast cancer patients' quality of life during the course of the disease .
results characteristics of patients and tumors the study randomly selected 1000 patients with invasive breast carcinoma .
according to the expression of er , pr and ar , this study contained 205 mabc ( er - / pr - / ar +) and 795 nonmabc patients , and then we randomly selected 205 nonmabc patients from these 795 samples .
all of these 410 cases were tested by immunohistochemical staining for epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) , ki67 , p53 and vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) .
location of immunohistochemical staining of each protein marker in breast cancer tissues was illustrated in figure 1 .
figure 2 showed a tumor classified as carcinomas with apocrine differentiation , which had the immunohistochemical characteristics of mabc ( er - / pr - / ar +) .
details of the patients and tumors were shown in supplementary table 1 .
patients in this cohort were female ranging in age from 31 to 78 years at diagnosis , and median age was 53 years .
results showed that most of the mabc patients ( 56.1 % , 115 / 205 ) were pre - / perimenopausal versus 39.5 % ( 81 / 205 ) of the nonmabc patients ( chi2 = 11.300 , p = 0.001 ) .
the majority of the tumors were classified as invasive carcinoma of no specific type ( nst ) , and the others included invasive lobular carcinoma ( ilc ) , carcinomas with apocrine differentiation , invasive micropapillary carcinoma ( impc ) , invasive papillary carcinoma ( ipc ) , carcinomas with medullary features and other invasive carcinomas .
among 410 enrolled patients , 78 cases developed distant metastasis , including 48 mabc and 30 nonmabc cases , and the median time for first distant metastasis was 28 months ( range , 5 - 111 months ) and 61 months ( range , 5 - 106 months ) , respectively .

( bar = 80mum ) characteristics of early versus late distant metastasis using the cut - off point of 5 years , 54 ( 69.2 %) cases were recorded as early distant metastasizing tumors , while 24 ( 30.8 %) were the late ones among 78 distant metastasizing tumors .
furthermore , there were 41 early and 7 late distant metastasizing tumors in mabc subgroup .
while in nonmabc subgroup , 13 were recorded as early distant metastasizing tumors , and 17 were the late ones .
results showed that mabc subgroup metastasized earlier than nonmabc subgroup ( p < 0.001 , table 1 ) .
as mabc includes tumors with er - / pr - / her2 - / ar + and er - / pr - / her2 +/ ar + and others all belonged to the nonmabc subgroup , we then analyzed the difference of time to distant metastasis in er - / pr - / her2 - / ar + and er - / pr - / her2 - / ar - subgroups , as well as in er - / pr - / her2 +/ ar + and er - / pr - / her2 +/ ar - subgroups .
we then found that tumors with er - / pr - / her2 - / ar + and er - / pr - / her2 +/ ar + metastasized earlier than the corresponding comparative groups ( p = 0.018 , p = 0.030 , table 1 ) .
the association between clinicopathological and biological variables and early versus late distant metastasis was shown in table 2 .
it indicated that there were significant differences between early and late distant metastasizing tumors with respect to histological grade ( p = 0.003 ) , tumor stage ( p = 0.019 ) , lymph node metastasis ( p = 0.035 ) and tnm stage ( p = 0.017 ) .
it showed that higher histological grade , tumor stage , tnm stage and more lymph node metastasis tumors metastasized earlier than the others .
the early distant metastasizing tumors seemed to have higher proliferative ability by ki67 labeling ( p = 0.044 ) , and exhibited higher incidence of her2 and vegf positivity expression than the late ones ( p = 0.033 , p = 0.004 ) .
but time to distant metastasis had no differences among patients' age , menopausal status , and p53 expression ( p = 0.688 , p = 0.909 , p = 1.000 ) .

site of distant metastasis the organs of distant metastasis were described in table 3 .
among the 78 patients developed distant metastasis , 27 cases developed multiple metastases during the course of follow - up , including 16 mabc and 11 nonmabc cases .
bone was the most common site for metastasis ( 50 %) followed by lung ( 34.6 %) , liver ( 26.9 %) , brain ( 16.7 %) and kidney ( 3.8 %) , respectively .
mabc showed a tendency for a higher metastasis rate in lung , liver and brain than nonmabc subgroup ( p = 0.010 , p = 0.044 , p = 0.048 ) , but lower metastasis rate in bone ( p = 0.012 ) .

p values were calculated by chi - square test .
to better understand the behavior of mabc , we then divided mabc into 136 her2 - negative cases and 69 her2 - positive cases , since mabc subgroup included tumors with er - / pr - / her2 - ( triple - negative breast cancer , tnbc ) and er - / pr - / her2 + ( her2 - overexpression ) .
results showed that there were 9 , 8 , 4 and 5 cases developed bone , lung , liver and brain metastasis , respectively , in her2 - positive mabc subgroup .
while in her2 - negative mabc subgroup , the corresponding cases were 3 , 12 , 11 and 5 , respectively .
furthermore , there was one patient developed kidney metastasis in her2 - negative mabc subgroup .
notably , significant difference was found only between bone metastasis and her2 status within mabc patients ( p = 0.002 , table 4 ) .

p values were calculated by chi - square test .
vegf was one of major proangiogenic factors , and we then also analyzed whether vegf played a critical role in the site of distant metastasis within mabc subgroup .
there was significant difference between vegf positive expression and mabc subgroup ( chi2 = 9.333 , p = 0.002 , figure 3a ) .
in 66 vegf - positive mabc subgroup , 9 patients developed bone metastasis , while 8 , 8 , 3 and 1 patients developed lung , liver , brain and kidney metastasis , respectively .
in 139 vegf - negative mabc subgroup , there were 3 , 12 , 7 and 7 patients developed bone , lung , liver and brain metastasis , respectively .
interestingly , only bone metastasis was influenced by vegf expression , and vegf positive expression tumors were more inclined to develop bone metastasis ( p = 0.002 , table 4 ) .
figure 3 the expression of vegf was significantly different between mabc and nonmabc subgroups , and patients with mabc indicated poor prognosis than nonmabc subgroup a. there was significant difference between vegf positive expression and mabc subgroup ( chi2 = 9.333 , p = 0.002 ) .
b. , c. and d. .
distant metastasis - free survival ( dmfs ) , disease - free survival ( dfs ) and overall survival ( os ) curves of 410 patients were generated according to the kaplan - meier method .
survival analysis the distant metastasis - free survival ( dmfs ) differed significantly between mabc and nonmabc subgroups , and the dmfs of the mabc subgroup was worse than that of the nonmabc subgroup ( p = 0.021 , figure 3b ) .
the probability of 5 - year dmfs for the mabc and nonmabc subgroups was 80.0 % and 93.7 % and for 10 - year dmfs was 76.6 % and 85.4 % , respectively .
the probability of 5 - year disease - free survival ( dfs ) for the mabc and nonmabc subgroups was 77.6 % and 88.3 % and that of 10 - year dfs was 71.7 % and 80.0 % , respectively .
similarly , the dfs for the mabc subgroup was significantly worse than that of the nonmabc subgroup ( p = 0.046 , figure 3c ) .
the 5 - year and 10 - year overall survival ( os ) rates were 87.3 % and 79.0 % , respectively , for mabc , and 94.1 % and 89.8 % , respectively , for nonmabc , with significant statistical differences ( p = 0.003 , figure 3d ) .
in mabc subgroup , 128 ( 62.4 %) had undergone chemotherapy alone , and 56 ( 27.3 %) had undergone both radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
in addition , in nonmabc subgroup , 115 ( 56.1 %) had undergone chemotherapy alone , and 75 ( 36.6 %) had undergone both radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
there were no significant differences for the dmfs , dfs or os between mabc patients who had undergone chemotherapy alone and undergone both radiotherapy and chemotherapy ( p = 0.169 , p = 0.219 , p = 0.165 ; figure 4a , 4b and 4c ) .
however , in nonmabc subgroup , the dmfs was superior for women who were adherent to both radiotherapy and chemotherapy than those who undergone chemotherapy alone ( p = 0.042 ; figure 4d ) .
it seemed that the dfs and os were also superior for patients who accepted both radiotherapy and chemotherapy , and differences reached statistical significance ( p = 0.005 , p = 0.017 ; figure 4e and 4f ) .
figure 4 patients undergone both adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy had relative better outcome than those undergone chemotherapy alone within nonmabc subgroup , but there was no significant difference in mabc subgroup a. , b. and c. .
dmfs , dfs and os curves of 184 mabc patients undergone both radiotherapy and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone were generated according to the kaplan - meier method .
d. , e. and f. .
dmfs , dfs and os curves of 190 nonmabc patients undergone both radiotherapy and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone were generated according to the kaplan - meier method .
discussion we have previously stated that mabc was associated with a serious of increased risk of malignant breast cancer , including higher histological grade , tumor stage , and ptnm stage [ 11 ] .
our findings from this study supplemented the conclusion that mabc tumors metastasized earlier than nonmabc .
similar to huang et al [ 12 ] , pre - / perimenopausal women were at increased risk of developing breast tumors negative for er and pr. results in the current study showed that pre - / perimenopausal patients were at increased risk of developing breast tumors not only negative for er and pr , but also positive for ar. in agreement with published literature [ 13 ] , our data clearly indicated that hormone receptor negative breast cancer ( er - / pr - ) patients metastasized earlier than hormone receptor positive patients .
in addition , the results also showed that ar positive expression tumors metastasized earlier than ar negative ones in hormone receptor negative patients .
this might due to the fact that most of the early metastasizing tumors were er and pr negative expression , and ar appeared to be an oncogenic driver in er - negative tumors [ 5 ] .
ki67 was a proliferative activity index and an established prognostic biomarker of breast cancer , and this study found that only minority ( 2.6 %) of the early distant metastasizing tumors and 9.0 % of all the distant metastasizing tumors expressed lower ki67 (< 20 %) .
this would be interpreted as ki67 higher expression tumors were more inclined to develop distant metastasis earlier .
in the treatment of breast cancer patients , the major pattern of failure after surgery was distant metastasis , and an early assessment of metastatic risk was important in different molecular breast cancer therapy .
bone is the most common site for distant metastasis and is of particular clinical importance in breast cancer patients .
it has been shown that hormone receptor positive breast cancers have a greater tendency to develop bone metastasis [ 14 - 16 ] .
kennecke et al [ 17 ] stated that bone was the most common metastatic site in all subtypes except basal - like breast cancer .
in addition , researchers [ 17 - 21 ] have also found that receptor negative breast cancer showed increased incidence of visceral and cerebral distant metastasis .
however , koo et al [ 15 ] stated thatlung metastasis showed all of three subtypes ( triple - negative type , her - 2 type , er + or pr +/ her - 2 - type ) in similar proportions .
this study found that nonmabc patients had a greater tendency to develop bone metastasis , and mabc showed a tendency for a higher metastasis rate in lung , liver and brain .
results also showed that the median time for first metastasis was 28 months and 61 months in mabc and nonmabc subgroups , respectively .
moreover , 16 mabc and 11 nonmabc cases developed multiple metastases during the course of follow - up. all these results revealed that receptor negative breast cancer patients had a high risk to develop advanced diseases , and ar expression could not reverse the progression of disease in hormone receptor negative breast cancer .
ar might also influence the site of distant metastasis in breast cancer , so more studies should be carried out to confirm this hypothesis .
mabc has a distinct hormone receptor profile , being er and pr negative , but ar positive , and her2 either positive or negative expression .
so the effect of her2 expression on distant metastasis was analyzed in the current study .
in agreement with previously published data , her2 positivity was not identified as a strong predictive factor for site specific metastasis [ 13 ] , except for bone metastasis .
however , some researchers have found that her2 - enriched tumors were associated with a significantly higher rate of brain , liver , and lung metastases [ 17 , 22 ] .
these differences might due to the fact that ar expression could regulate the behavior of breast cancer , especially tumors with er and pr negative expression .
therefore , her2 status might regulate the site of distant metastasis partly dependent on ar positive expression in tumors with er and pr negative expression .
the density of microvessels of tumorigenesis could reflect patient 's prognosis , and vegf is a key mediator of proangiogenic factors .
vegf promotes vascular endothelial growth and mediates vessel permeability , thus facilitating tumor progression and metastatic spread [ 23 ] , and high protein levels of vegf seemed to be associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients [ 24 ] .
in the current study , high positive rate of vegf expression was detected in mabc subgroup and vegf positive expression patients developed distant metastasis earlier than those with vegf negative expression .
in addition , vegf was observed to be upregulated in bone metastases compared with those in the lung , liver or brain in mabc subgroup .
the results of the present study confirmed that high expression of vegf protein was more common in patients with mabc and was usually associated with a higher incidence of distant metastasis , especially bone metastasis .
it has been indicated that in patients with er - positive tumor , ar expression was associated with a better outcome [ 25 , 26 ] .
the published literature has yielded extremely controversial findings regarding the potential prognostic role of ar expression in hormone receptor negative breast cancer .
some researchers [ 27 , 28 ] reported that ar positivity was not associated with dfs or os , but mrklic et al [ 28 ] found that ar expression correlated inversely with higher mitotic score , clinical stage , histological grade , and ki - 67 proliferation index .
agoff et al [ 29 ] highlighted an association of ar expression with better dfs , while hu et al [ 3 ] reported that ar expression was an unfavorable prognostic factor .
in the present study , we found that ar expression was not only associated with worse dfs and os , but also associated with worse dmfs in receptor negative breast cancer .
however , further studies adopting more samples should be adopted to validate the present findings and uncover potential underlying mechanisms and molecular pathways .
studies have confirmed that the use of chemotherapy was associated with an improved overall survival rate , and no difference was observed between the various chemotherapy regimens used [ 30 - 32 ] .
bulut et al [ 33 ] stated that patients with triple negative breast cancer had similar survival with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
this study assessed survival rate between patients who had undergone both radiotherapy and chemotherapy and those undergone chemotherapy alone in different molecular subgroups .
results indicated that mabc patients might receive chemotherapy only , as no difference was found between patients who had undergone chemotherapy alone and undergone both radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
on the contrary , survival rate was superior for patients undergone both radiotherapy and chemotherapy in nonmabc subgroup .
however , we did not take into consideration the endocrine therapy or trastuzumab treatment , which could influence the outcome of er - positive or her2 - positive breast cancer patients .
further studies on larger cohorts of patients are required to assess the role of molecular subtype in breast cancer treatment , and more factors affected patients' prognosis should also be taken into account .
in conclusion , these findings led to a new understanding of mabc and confirmed that molecular subtypes were strongly related to distant metastasis , in terms of site - specific metastasis , early / late metastasis and survival outcomes .
nonmabc patients have a tendency to develop bone metastasis and they have better survival outcomes compared to mabc subgroup with a tendency of developing viscera and brain metastasis .
in addition , the outcome of mabc subgroup was similar between those undergone both radiotherapy and chemotherapy and those undergone chemotherapy alone , but the outcome was superior for patients undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy in nonmabc subgroup .
this study also clarified that targeting ar would present an attractive treatment option for mabc cases , and these results were of help in choices for treatment in individual breast cancer patients .
materials and methods patients and grouped the study randomly selected 1000 patients with invasive breast carcinoma enrolled between january 2004 and december 2005 .
the cases were registered in the archives of the department of breast cancer pathology and research laboratory , tianjin medical university instituted and cancer hospital , tianjin , china .
this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional ethic committee of tianjin medical university instituted and cancer hospital .
informed consent was obtained from all the patients before their surgery and the examination of the specimens .
patients with a previous cancer during the last 10 years or patients with bilateral primary breast cancers were excluded .
all of these cases had not received preoperative treatments and their clinicopathologic date was available .
first of all , all of these cases were tested by immunohistochemical staining for er , pr and ar , and samples were divided into mabc ( er - / pr - / ar +) and nonmabc subgroups .
as the quantity of mabc was much smaller than nonmabc , we then randomly selected a sample among nonmabc which had the same number with mabc subgroup .
then all of these selected cases were tested by immunohistochemical staining for her2 , ki67 , p53 and vegf .
immunohistochemical assay and evaluation of the staining immunohistochemistry was carried out as previously reported [ 34 ] .
the slides were immunostained using primary antibodies against er ( sp1 , 1 : 200 dilution ; zeta ) , pr ( sp2 , 1 : 200 dilution ; zeta ) , ar ( ar441 , 1 : 100 dilution ; labvision ) , her2 ( cb11 , 1 : 100 dilution ; invitrogen ) , ki67 ( k - 2 , 1:100 dilution ; invitrogen ) , p53 ( sp5 , 1:100 dilution ; invitrogen ) and vegf ( za - 0580 , 1:50 dilution ; zsgb ) .
sections of normal breast tissue were processed simultaneously and served as positive controls for er and pr. similarly , her2 , ki67 , p53 and ar positive breast cancer tissues were used as positive controls for her2 , ki67 , p53 and ar , respectively .
in addition , normal goat serum substituted primary antibodies as negative controls .
the immunostaining was scored by two senior pathologists , who were blinded to patients' clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes .
for each antibody , the location of immunoreactivity , percentage of stained cells , and intensity were determined .
er and pr were considered positive if nuclear staining was present in more than 1 % of the tumor cells ; her2 was considered positive when there was a strong whole membrane staining in > 10 % of the tumor cells ; ki67 was expressed as percentage of positive cells ( strong nuclear staining ) , with a threshold of 20 % or above being considered high ; tumors with 10 % or greater nuclear positivity were considered to be positive for p53 and ar ; as for vegf , at least 10 % of cells ( cytoplasm ) needed to be stained to be considered positive .
follow - up all the patients had been treated according to modern guidelines , including operation , the use of adjuvant chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and endocrine and targeted therapy .
we retrospectively reviewed 128 months follow - up data .
the follow - up contacts were carried out at 3 - month intervals over the first year , 6 - month intervals during the second year , and at 12 - month intervals thereafter .
the methods included clinical physical examination , x - ray , ultrasound techniques , ct as well as puncture biopsy verification to suspected metastatic lesions .
the follow - up scheme was the same for all patients .
statistic analyses statistical analysis was carried out using spss 19.0 statistical software .
differences of continuous variables between mabc and nonmabc subgroups , as well as early and late distant metastasis tumors , were evaluated by the chi - square test .
dmfs , dfs and os curves were generated according to the kaplan - meier method .
the differences between the curves were assessed using the log - rank test .
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .

abstract background early intervention programs ( eip ) have been developed in many countries ( united states , europe , canada , australia ) and are now widely considered effective in the treatment of early psychosis .
in france , current national policies in the field of mental health promote the development of early intervention but france has not yet met national standards of care for eip .
a recent report from the london school of economics ( 2016 ) comparing different european countries even mentioned the delay of france in this area , referring to only one eip in the country .
however , different early intervention initiatives have emerged in france during the last decade without such information being centralized and therefore with no visibility on the current situation over the whole territory .
the aims of this study were to draw up a comprehensive inventory of existing or planned programs ( in metropolitan france and in the overseas territories ) in 2017 and to describe how they operate in 2016 .
methods this was a two - phase study ; phase one was to identify and create an inventory of existing initiatives , and phase two was to describe and conduct an analysis of each initiative .
to be included , identified initiatives had to offer an early , intensive and multidisciplinary approach with at least 0.5 dedicated full - time equivalent staff .
a secondary inclusion criterion concerned the out - patient setting of the initiative .
inventory was achieved through many contacts across the country , among physicians / psychiatrists , healthcare facilities ( hospitals , clinics , adolescent centers ...) or administrative institutions ( health regional agencies ...) which may either provide this kind of care or know of such initiatives .
an online declarative survey was administered between march and july 2017 to the identified psychiatrists with questions that covered administrative and clinical topics : structure of attachment , dedicated team , funding , targeted population , activity in 2016 , partners of the program , difficulties encountered and prospects .
results between march and july 2017 , 37 eip for management of early psychosis were identified in france : 18 were operational , 8 were being established , and discussions were under way for the remaining 11 .
the 18 identified operational programs were located throughout the country with a few regional disparities .
all programs operated with multidisciplinary teams , including at least one psychiatrist and one nurse , and with a mean of 4.3 dedicated full - time equivalents healthcare workers ( median : 3.7 ) .
most programs offered case management ( 12 / 18 ) , with caseloads ranging from 4:1 to 22:1 .
the mean caseload was 10:1 ( standard deviation 8:1 ) .
all programs included 15 to 35 year - old early psychosis patients .
four programs also included patients at ultra - high risk for psychosis ( uhr ) , while 4 others continued patient management during the chronic stages ; 4 initiatives included all these stages of the disease .
half of the programs had been existing for 2 to 5 years ( 50 %) ; 89 % were created less than 5 years ago .
the surveyed professionals described an increasing number of patients under their care .
discussion numerous projects and discussions appear to be under way ( some programs should open very soon ) .
a real dynamic has been launched in france with an increasing focus and this evaluation will help to improve visibility of the identified programs and promote the development of new programs .

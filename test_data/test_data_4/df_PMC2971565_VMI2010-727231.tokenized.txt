the present study was planned to investigate the disposition kinetics of levofloxacin in plasma of female native barky breed sheep after single intravenous ( iv ) and intramuscular ( im ) administration of 4 mg / kg body weight .
the concentrations of levofloxacin in the plasma were measured using high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) with a uv detector on samples collected at 0 , 0.08 , 0.16 , 0.33 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 32 , and 48 h after treatment .
following intravenous injection , the decline in plasma drug concentration was biexponential with half - lives of ( t 1 / 2alpha ) 0.33 +/ - 0.12 h and ( t 1 / 2beta ) 3.29 +/ - 0.23 h for distribution and elimination phases , respectively .
the volume of distribution at steady state v ( d ( ss )) was 0.86 +/ - 0.23 l / kg. after intramuscular administration of levofloxacin at the same dose , the peak plasma concentration ( c max ) was 3.1 +/ - 0.35 mug / ml and was obtained at 1.64 +/ - 0.29 h ( t max ) , the elimination half - life ( t 1 / 2el ) was 3.58 +/ - 0.30 h , and auc was 20.24 +/ - 1.31 mug.h / ml. the systemic bioavailability was 91.35 +/ - 6.81 % .
in vitro plasma protein binding was 23.74 % .
when approved therapy fails , levofloxacin may be used in some countries for therapy of food animals , however , that is not true in the us .
1. introduction levofloxacin is a recently introduced third - generation fluoroquinolones with high activity against a wide spectrum of gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria [ 1 ] .
in human clinical trials , levofloxacin has been found to be very effective in the treatment of infections of upper and lower respiratory tract , genitourinary system , and skin and soft tissue [ 2 ] .
compared to other fluoroquinolones , ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin , levofloxacin has more pronounced bactericidal activity against organisms such as pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae [ 3 ] .
the bactericidal effect of levofloxacin is achieved through reversible binding to dna gyrase and subsequent inhibition of bacterial dna replication and transcription [ 4 - 6 ] .
fluoroquinolones act by a concentration - dependent killing mechanism , whereby the optimal effect is attained by the administration of high doses over a short period of time [ 7 ] .
this concentration - dependent killing profile is associated with a relatively prolonged postantibiotic effect [ 8 ] .
for this class of antimicrobials , drug exposure , as measured by the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( auc ) , has been used to calculate surrogate efficacy indices , such as the auc / mic ratio , where mic stands for the in vitro minimal inhibiting concentration of the tested bacteria [ 9 - 11 ] .
thus , variations of drug exposure can be associated with variations in the probability of a successful outcome with a specific dosage regime .
the drug undergoes a limited metabolism in rats and human [ 12 ] and is primarily excreted by kidney mainly as active drug .
inactive metabolites ( n - oxide and desmethyl metabolites ) represent < 5 % of the total dose [ 13 ] , as other fluoroquinolones are metabolised in chickens as reported in [ 14 - 16 ] , as chickens metabolized marbofloxacin to n - desmethyl - marbofloxacin .
the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin has been investigated in a limited number of animal species including rats [ 17 ] , rabbits [ 18 ] , calves [ 19 , 20 ] , goats [ 21 ] , cats [ 22 ] , male camels [ 23 ] , and stallions [ 24 ] .
however , there is no available information on the kinetics of levofloxacin in the sheep .
therefore , the present study was undertaken to determine the disposition kinetics and bioavailability of levofloxacin in sheep following a single intravenous ( iv ) or intramuscular ( im ) administration of 4 mg / kg bwt .
2. material and methods 2.1 .
drugs and chemicals levaquin ( 25 mg / ml of levofloxacin solution ) was obtained from janssen pharmaceutica n v ( beerse , belgium ) .
ciprofloxacin as internal standard was purchased from sigma , chemical company ( st. louis , mo , usa ) .
the solvents ( baker inc. , phillipsburg , nj , usa ) used during the chromatographic analysis of the drug were hplc grade .
2.2 .
experimental animals the study was approved by the animal care and use committee at the faculty of veterinary medicine , cairo university .
we used ten female native barky breed 2 - 3 years old , 45 - 55 kg body weight .
the animals were in optimal nutritional condition , fed on concentrated pellets , hay , and alfalfa , and had free access to water ad libitum daily .
the health of all animals was monitored prior to and throughout the experimental period .
2.3 .
drug administration the study was performed in two phases , following a crossover design ( 5 x 5 ) .
animals were randomly assigned into two groups , with each group containing five animals .
in phase one of the study , five animals were given a single intravenous injection into the left jugular vein at dose of 4 mg / kg bodyweight levofloxacin , and the other five were injected intramuscularly into the lower third region of the neck muscles with the drug at the same dose .
three ml venous whole blood samples were taken by jugular venepuncture into 10 ml heparinized vacutainers ( becton dickinson vacutainer systems , rutherford , nj , usa ) .
the sampling times were 0 ( blank sample ) , 0.08 , 0.16 , 0.33 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 32 , and 48 h after treatment .
all the blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min to separate the plasma .
the plasma samples were frozen at - 20degreesc until analysed .
after a washout period of 2 weeks , the animals that had been injected intravenously with the drug were injected intramuscularly and vice versa .
pilot studies have shown that a 2 - week period is enough to avoid carry over effect .
blood was collected and processed as above .
the heparinized plasma samples were frozen at - 20degreesc and analyzed by high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) .
all samples were analyzed within one week after each experimental phase .
2.4 .
analytical method plasma concentrations of levofloxacin were measured using a modified hplc method [ 25 ] .
briefly , the hplc system was performed on shimadzu liquid chromatography system ( duisburg , germany ) equipped with an lc9a pump , an automatic sampler sil6b , and a uv detector .
class lc 10 software version 1.6 ( shimadzu ) was used for data analysis and processing .
levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin ( as internal standard , 99.2 pure , 1 mug 10 / mul methanol ) were isolated from plasma .
the plasma proteins were removed via methanol precipitation ; 200 mul plasma were mixed with 400 mul methanol and vigorously shaken .
the precipitated proteins were removed via centrifugation at 12000 x g for 5 min .
subsequently , 20 mul of the supernatant were injected onto the column .
the hplc separation was performed using a reversed - phase c18 column ( discovery , supelco , 5 mum , 4.6 mm x 150 mm ) with an injection volume of 20 mul .
the mobile phase consisted of water : acetonitrile ( 80 : 20 , v / v ) with 0.3 % of triethylamine and ph adjusted to 3.3 with phosphoric acid , using an isocratic form with a flow rate of 1.0 ml / min .
the detector wavelength was set at 295 nm. the analytes were identified from the retention times of 97 - 99 % pure reference standards .
the calibration curves of plasma were prepared with seven different concentrations between 0.01 and 10 mug / m l using blank sheep plasma .
a calibration curve was obtained by plotting the peak height ratio versus the nominal concentrations .
the equation was calculated by the least - squares method using linear regression .
the limit of quantification ( loq ) based on a signal - to - noise ratio > 5 was 0.04 mug / ml of levofloxacin in supplemented sheep plasma .
under our experimental conditions , the linearity of the method was from 0.01 to 10 mug / ml of levofloxacin sheep plasma , and the value of correlation coefficients ( r ) was > 0.99 .
the peak height ratios of an unknown specimen ( peak height of levofloxacin / peak height of internal standard ) were compared with that of the standard .
the precision and accuracy of the method were evaluated by repetitive analysis of the plasma samples ( n = 12 ) spiked with different known concentrations of levofloxacin .
the percentage recoveries were determined by comparing the peak height of blank samples spiked with different amounts of drug and treated as any sample , with the peak height of the same standards prepared in phosphate buffer ( n = 6 ) .
intra - assay variations were determined by measuring six replicates ( n = 6 ) of three standard samples used for calibration curves .
the intra - assay variation coefficients were < 4.3 % .
interassay precisions were determined by assaying the three standard samples on three separate days .
the interassay variation coefficients were < 4.6 % .
recovery of levofloxacin from plasma was found to be 93 % .
2.5 .
in vitro plasma protein binding the extent of plasma protein binding was determined in vitro using ultrafiltration [ 26 ] ; antimicrobial - free plasma from sheep fortified with known concentrations of levofloxacin ( 0.01 , 0.16 , 0.32 , 1.25 , 5 , and 10 mug / ml ) was used .
one ml of each sample was placed on a conditioned semipermeable membrane ( centriflow cones cf - 50 , amicon corp. , lexington , ma , usa ) resting on porous conical polyethylene support on the top of centrifuge tubes .
the tubes were centrifuged at 1500 g for 45 - 60 min .
plasma samples and their corresponding ultrafiltrates were assayed by the same method ( hplc ) as described above .
the percentage of plasma protein binding was calculated according to the following equation : ( 1 ) protein binding %= total concentration - ultrafiltrate concentrationtotal concentrationx100 .
2.6 .
pharmacokinetic analysis pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma levofloxacin concentration versus time data was conducted by noncompartmental analysis using winnonlin professional version 4.1 software package ( pharsight corporation , mountain view , california ) .
for the intravenous data , the appropriate pharmacokinetic model was determined by visual examination of individual concentration - time curves and by application of akaike 's information criterion ( aic ) [ 27 ] .
the plasma concentration - time relationship was best estimated as a two - compartment open model : ( 2 ) cp = ae - alphat + be - betat , where c p is the concentration of drug in the plasma at time t , a and b are the zero - time drug intercepts of the distribution and elimination phase expressed as mug / ml , alpha and beta are the distribution and elimination rate constants expressed in units of reciprocal time ( h - 1 ) , and e is the natural logarithm base .
the distribution and elimination half - lives ( t 1 / 2alpha and t 1 / 2beta ) were calculated according to standard equations [ 28 ] , while the volume of distribution at steady state ( v ( d ( ss ))) and the mean residence time ( mrt ) were calculated according to the following equations ( v ( d ( ss )) = clb x mrt and mrt = aumc / auc ) , respectively .
following im administration of levofloxacin , plasma concentrations data were analyzed by both compartmental and noncompartmental methods based on the statistical moment theory [ 28 ] .
the terminal elimination half - life ( t 1 / 2el ) and absorption half - life ( t 1 / 2 ( a )) were calculated as ln 2 / k el or ln 2 / k a , respectively , where k el and k ab are the elimination and absorption rate constant , respectively .
the areas under the concentration - time curves ( auc ) were calculated by the trapezoidal rule and further extrapolated to infinity by dividing the last experimental plasma concentration by the terminal slope ( beta ) .
the mean residence time ( mrt ) was calculated as aumc / auc , where aumc is the area under the first moment curve , each individual curve of levofloxacin over time was analyzed to determine the peak concentration c max ( extrapolated from the curve ) , and the time to peak concentration t max was read from the data .
the systemic clearance was calculated as cl = dose / auc .
the absolute bioavailability ( f %) was calculated as ( aucim / auciv ) x 100 .
in case of extravascular administration , the volume of distribution at steady state ( v ( d ( ss ))) and the systemic clearance ( clb ) were calculated according to the following equations ( v ( d ( ss )) = vd / f ) and clb = clb / f , respectively .
pharmacodynamic efficacy of levofloxacin was determined by calculating the c max / mic and auc24 / mic ratios following im administrations using the respective mean mic value for susceptible klebsiella spp .
( 0.06 mug / ml ) , shigella spp .
( 0.06 mug / ml ) , salmonella spp .
( 0.12 mug / ml ) , proteus spp .
( 0.06 mug / ml ) , and acinetobacter spp .
( 0.12 mug / ml ) according to marshall and jones [ 29 ] ; these values were derived from those determined in the studies involving antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against strains isolated from human beings .
2.7 .
statistical analysis the statistical analysis was performed using the spss 17.1 software package ( sas , cary , nc , usa ) .
results are presented as arithmetic mean +/ - sd. the nonparametric wilcoxon test was used to compare the parameters obtained after intravenous and intramuscular administration .
means were considered significantly different at p < . 05 .
3. results clinical examination of all animals before and after each trial did not reveal any abnormalities .
no adverse reactions were observed after the single - dose iv or im administration of levofloxacin in the animals studied .
akaike 's information criterion test indicated that a two - compartment model best represented the plasma concentration versus time data after iv administration of levofloxacin in sheep .
the mean plasma concentration - time profiles of levofloxacin following single iv and im administrations of 4 mg / kg b.wt are presented graphically in figure 1 .
mean +/ - sd values of pharmacokinetic parameters estimated from the curve fitting are shown in table 1 .
in vitro plasma protein binding of levofloxacin was 23.74 % .
following intramuscular administrations of levofloxacin using mic <= 0.12 mug / ml , the c max / mic90 ratio was 25.83 - fold , and the auc0 - 24 / mic90 ratio was 160.42 h .
4. discussion plasma levofloxacin disposition curves after iv injection were best fit to an open bicompartmental model in all the animals , which is in accordance with the results reported for calves and lactating goats , respectively , [ 20 , 21 ] .
the v ( d ( ss )) is a clearance - independent volume of distribution that is used to calculate the drug amount in the body under equilibrium conditions [ 30 ] .
fluoroquinolones are lipid - soluble drugs that have a large volume of distribution [ 31 ] .
the v ( d ( ss )) for levofloxacin was 0.86 l / kg in sheep indicating a relatively wide distribution after iv administration and it was slightly differing from that reported for levofloxacin in lactating goats 0.73 l / kg [ 21 ] and moxifloxacin in lactating goats ( 0.79 l / kg ) [ 32 ] .
the discrepancies between values calculated for pharmacokinetic parameters may be attributed to the animal species , the drug formulation employed , the age , size or sex of the animals , to differences in fatty tissue deposits between animal species or breeds , or even to interindividual variations and also due to the method of analysis of the drug [ 33 ] .
the clearance of levofloxacin in sheep was 0.2 l / h.kg similar to those values reported in calves and lactating goats 0.19 and 0.18 l / h.kg [ 20 , 21 ] , respectively .
the elimination half - life of levofloxacin following iv administration was 3.29 h. this value is close to that reported for levofloxacin in lactating goats 2.95 h [ 21 ] and longer than that reported in calves [ 20 ] 1.61 h , and shorter than that reported in rabbits 7.50 h [ 18 ] .
following intramuscular injection , the present data were best represented by a one - compartment model and the estimated c max ( 3.10 mug / ml ) was similar to that data reported in calves and lactating goats ( 3.07 and 3.16 mug / ml ) [ 19 , 21 ] , respectively .
the time to reach the maximum concentration of levofloxacin in sheep ( t max = 1.64 h ) was longer than that recorded levofloxacin in calves ( 1.00 h ) [ 19 ] and shorter than that reported in lactating goats 1.76 h [ 21 ] .
the absorption process of levofloxacin was moderately fast as showed by the absorption rate constant ( k a ) 1.39 h - 1 , short absorption half - life ( t1 / 2 ( a )) 0.51 h , and confirmed by the short t max ( 1.64 h ) .
the overall mrt was longer for im administration compared with that for iv injection , with an estimated time of 5.33 h. this was expected as the mrt after im injection depends on both the disposition and absorption rates .
the mrt of levofloxacin was similar to that recorded for calves and lactating goats ( 5.57 and 5.24 h ) [ 19 , 21 ] , respectively .
the elimination half - life value was 3.58 h after im administration , similar to that recorded for calves and lactating goats ( 3.67 and 3.64 h ) [ 19 , 21 ] , respectively .
the systemic bioavailability of levofloxacin in sheep after im administration was 91.35 % , and the absorption process was rapid with absorption half - life ( t 1 / 2 ( a )) 0.51 h. this value indicates the excellent absorption of the drug from that injection site .
this value was similar to values reported for levofloxacin in lactating goats [ 21 ] and moxifloxacin in sheep [ 34 ] and that reported value was effectively higher than that reported for calves 56.6 % [ 19 ] .
protein binding has long been considered one of the most important physicochemical characteristics of drugs , playing a potential role in distribution , excretion , and therapeutic effectiveness as a low protein binding generally enables a rapid and extensive distribution into the intracellular and extracellular space [ 35 ] .
in this study , the in vitro plasma protein binding experiment showed that levofloxacin displayed a low level of binding to plasma proteins ( approximately 23.74 %) to sheep plasma .
the results of in vitro protein binding may differ substantially depending on the methodology and experimental conditions [ 36 ] .
the low protein binding of levofloxacin in sheep plasma proteins is in agreement with previously reported value of 22 % in lactating goats [ 21 ] , 24 % in human [ 12 ] and 25 % in rabbits [ 18 ] .
nevertheless , it was relatively lower to that reported ( 17 %) in calves [ 19 ] .
it has been established that for concentration - dependant fluoroquinolones , the auc0 - 24 / mic90 ratio is the most important efficacy predictor , with the rate of clinical cure being greater than 80 % when this ratio is higher than 100 - 125 [ 37 ] .
a second predictor of efficacy for concentration dependent antibiotic is the ratio c max / mic90 , considering that values >= 10 would lead to better clinical results [ 38 ] .
high c max / mic90 ratios have been associated with a lower incidence resistance development [ 39 ] .
it is suggested that the critical break points determining the efficacy of fluoroquinolones are c max / mic90 >= 8 - 10 , and auc0 - 24 / mic90 >= 100 [ 38 , 39 ] .
the mic of levofloxacin has not yet been determined for bacteria isolated from sheep .
to cover most of the susceptible organisms , in this discussion , the mic90 of 0.12 mug / ml of levofloxacin has been taken into consideration [ 29 ] .
based on this data , a dosage of 4 mg / kg levofloxacin im in sheep would result in a c max / mic90 ratio of 25.83 - fold , which exceeds the recommended ratio of 10 .
the second surrogate marker auc24 / mic90 was 160.42 h. based on the calculated c max / mic90 and auc0 - 24 / mic90 , a dosage of 4 mg / kg b.wt. is recommended to treat infections caused by bacteria with mic <= 0.12 mug / ml. it can be concluded that levofloxacin administered intravenously or intramuscularly in the applied dosing schedule is efficacious against bacteria with mic <= 0.12 mug / ml. consequently , levofloxacin could be useful in the treatment of systemic infections in sheep after specific assessment of susceptible micro - organisms , also , when approved therapy fails , levofloxacin may be used in some countries for therapy of food animals , however , that is not true in the us. only enrofloxacin is approved for beef cattle and cannot be used extralabel .

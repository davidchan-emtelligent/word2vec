background human astroviruses ( hastvs ) are commonly identified worldwide as important aetiological agents of acute gastroenteritis in all age groups .
more and more evidences challenged the paradigm that astv infections are species - specific .
yet to date , astvs associated with human infections have not been detected in any animal hosts .
results viral metagenomics methods were used to detect viral nucleic acids in fecal samples from 69 captive non - human primates ( nhps ) from three zoos in china .
sequence reads showing high similarity to astrovirus mlb2 were found in feces from a chimpanzee with diarrhea .
the complete genome of this astrovirus was determined and deposited in the genbank under accession number kx273058 ( named sastv - nj ) .
phylogenetic analysis based on complete genomes revealed that sastv - nj was closely related to and shared > 98 % nucleotide sequence identity with the previous human astrovirus mlb2 strains .
conclusions this study suggested that mlb2 - related astroviruses might have the potential of cross - species transmission between human and nhp .

astvs cause gastroenteritis in the young children , but in animals their association with enteric diseases is not well documented , with the exception of turkey and mink astv infections [ 1 ] .
the number of astv - infected animal hosts has rapidly expanded in recent years .
astvs can infect at least 30 species of mammals including humans , sheep , cows , pigs , dogs , cats , red deer , mice , minks , bats , cheetahs , brown rats , roe deer , sea lions , dolphins , rabbits and nhps [ 2 , 3 ] .
astv infections were previously thought to be species - specific [ 4 , 5 ] , but these recently identified human astvs , including hastv - mlb1 - 3 , hmo astvs a , b , and c , and hastv - va 1 - 4 , were genetically much closer to astvs from animals than they are to the canonical hastvs and hastv1 - 8 [ 3 ] .
similar observations were reported for astvs detected in pigs , bats , california sea lions , sheep , minks and turkeys [ 3 ] .
detection of potential human - animal astv genetic recombination suggested that the species barrier may have been crossed at some point [ 6 , 7 ] .
more and more evidences challenged the paradigm that astv infections are species - specific .
yet to date , astvs associated with human infections have not been detected in any animal host .
in this study , using viral metagenomics , an astv strain which shows close relationship with the astv mlb2 strains from human based on the complete genome sequence was detected in the fecal sample of a chimpanzee having diarrhea. from sept .
2010 to may 2013 , 69 fecal specimens were collected from 69 nhps from three zoos in eastern china .
viral metagenomics method as previously described [ 8 ] was used to detect viral nucleic acids in these fecal samples .
briefly , fecal samples were suspended in dpbs , vortexed for 10 min , and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min .
the stool suspensions were collected in new 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes .
seven pools were randomly generated each of which contained ten fecal samples except the last one which contained nine samples .
after low speed centrifugation and filtration , the pooled sample suspensions were treated with dnase and rnase , to reduce levels of nhp nucleic acids while viral genomes are protected with the viral capsid from digestion .
seven libraries were then constructed using nextera xt dna sample preparation kit ( illumina ) and sequenced using the miseq illumina platform with 250 bases paired ends , with a distinct molecular tag for each pool .
paired - end reads were decoded using vendor software from illumina .
an in - house analysis pipeline running on a 32 - nodes linux cluster was used to process the data .
clonal reads were removed and low sequencing quality tails were trimmed using phred quality score ten as the threshold .
adaptors were trimmed using the default ncbi blastn parameters of vecscreen [ 9 ] with specialized parameters designed for adaptor removal .
the cleaned reads were de novo assembled by soapdenovo2 version r240 using kmer size 63 with default settings [ 10 ] .
the assembled contigs , along with singlets were aligned to an in - house viral proteome database using blastx .
the significant hits to virus were then aligned to an in - house non - virus - non - redundant ( nvnr ) universal proteome database using blastx .
hits with more significantly adjusted e - values to nvnr than to virus were removed .
the illumina miseq 2 x 250 base runs of the seven libraries generated raw sequence reads of 888598 , 718368 , 687546 , 545952 , 434548 , 896488 , and 476396 , respectively .
when the viral sequence reads from the library that contained 888598 raw sequence reads were analyzed , 24 sequence reads showed > 97 % nucleotide sequence identity to those of human astv mlb2 strains available in genbank .
in order to investigate the coverage of these astv sequence reads in the astv mlb2 - positive library , the raw sequence data of this library was then aligned to a representative astv strain mlb2 ( genbank no .
jf742759 ) which was used as a reference genome by " map to reference " in geneious software ( version 8.1.8 ) .
results indicated that the 24 astroviral reads were mapped to 9 different regions of jf742759 , covering 31 % ( 1869 / 6119 ) of its complete genome ( fig. 1a ) .
pcr primers were then designed based on the largest contig , and pcr screening was performed to detect this virus in the 69 fecal samples .
results indicated that only one positive sample in the original astv - positive library , which was from a chimpanzee with diarrhea .
viral metagenomic analysis revealed that the library positive for the astv also contained viral reads showing similarity to simian adenovirus and po - circo - like virus .
pcr using primers designed based on the contigs of the two types of viruses indicated that the astv - positive sample was negative for the adenovirus and po - circo - like virus. fig. 1 mapping astroviral reads in the raw library data over the referenced genome of jf742759 ( a ) and neighbor - joining phylogenetic trees using mega6 ( b , c ) .
b was the phylogenetic tree based on capsid protein gene sequences .
c indicated the phylogenetic tree based on rna - dependent rna polymerase gene sequences .
black dot indicated the sastv - nj identified in this study .
genbank accession numbers were shown in order to investigate the genetic difference between the astv from the chimpanzee in this study and its close relatives from the genbank , the nearly complete genome was determined by pcr to bridge sequence gaps using pcr primers based on sequences from the library and three closest reference strains from the genbank .
the sanger method was used to sequence the pcr products .
the nearly complete genome of this astv is 6120 bp and was named sastv - nj ( genbank no. kx273058 ) .
genome analysis indicated that , similar to its close relatives in the genbank , sastv - nj contained three major orfs : orf1a and orf1b at the 5 ' end encoding the non - structural proteins , and orf2 at the 3 ' end encoding the capsid protein .
based on the complete genome , sastv - nj shared > 98 % nucleotide sequence identity with three astv mlb2 strains with have complete genomes available in the genbank ( including jf742759 , ab829252 and kt224358 ) .
sequence analysis indicated that , over the orf1a region ( 2364 bp ) , sastv - nj has 36 , 48 and 49 bp differences from those of jf742759 , ab829252 , and kt224358 , respectively .
over the orf1b region ( 1536 bp ) , sastv - nj has 20 , 14 and 22 bp differences from those of jf742759 , ab829252 , and kt224358 , respectively .
the orf2 region ( 2238 bp ) has 25 , 41 and 37 bp differences between the sastv - nj and jf742759 , ab829252 and kt224358 , respectively .
phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the sequences of the rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) gene and putative capsid protein gene from sastv - nj , its closest relatives in the genbank , and other 17 representative astvs .
results confirmed that sastv - nj clustered closely with three previous astv mlb2 strains ( fig. 1b , c ) , suggesting sastv - nj belongs to an astv mlb2 strain .
astv mlb2 was first detected in human stool samples from india and the united states in 2009 [ 11 ] .
this virus was subsequently found in febrile children from usa [ 12 ] , children with diarrhea from japan and turkey [ 13 , 14 ] , and patients with meningitis [ 11 ] .
however , no previous studies mentioned discovering astv mlb2 from animals .
in the present study , an astv mlb2 strain in a chimpanzee with diarrhea was detected .
the viral metagenomic data indicated this chimpanzee was only positive for the astv mlb2 , suggesting that astv might have potential of cross - species infection between human and nhp and cause diarrhea .
the genome of sastv - nj was deposited in genbank under the accession numbers kx273058 .
the raw sequence reads from the metagenomic library were deposited in the short read archive of genbank database under accession number srx2163031 .
conclusions here , we characterized the nearly complete genome of astv mlb2 strain , named sastv - nj , from a chimpanzee with diarrhea in china .
sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicated that this astv mlb2 strain closely clustered with previous human astv mlb2 strains , sharing > 98 % sequence identity with them .
pcr screening revealed a single positive sample from the 69 nhp fecal samples , suggesting this case of astv mlb2 infection in the chimpanzee was sporadic .
further studies needs to be performed to confirm whether astv mlb2 can cause cross - species infection and is associated with diarrhea in non - human mammals .

background although aberrant protamine ( prm ) ratios have been observed in infertile men , the mechanisms that implicit the uncoupling of prm1 and prm2 expression remain unclear .
to uncover these mechanisms , in this observational study we have compared the prm1 / prm2 mrna ratio and mrna contents of two regulatory factors of these genes .
materials and methods in this experimental study , sampling was performed by a multi - step method from 50 non - obstructive azoospermic and 12 normal men .
after rna extraction and cdna synthesis , real - time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( rt - qpcr ) was used to analyze the prm1 , prm2 , y box binding protein 2 ( ybx2 ) and jmjc - containing histone demethylase 2a ( jhdm2a ) genes in testicular biopsies of the studied samples .
results the prm1 / prm2 mrna ratio differed significantly among studied groups , namely 0.21 +/ - 0.13 in azoospermic samples and - 0.8 +/ - 0.22 in fertile samples .
the amount of prm2 mrna , significantly reduced in azoospermic patients .
azoospermic men exhibited significant under expression of ybx2 gene compared to controls ( p < 0.001 ) .
mrna content of this gene showed a positive correlation with prm mrna ratio ( r = 0.6 , p = 0.007 ) .
jhdm2a gene expression ratio did not show any significant difference between the studied groups ( p = 0.3 ) .
we also observed no correlation between jhdm2a mrna content and the prm mrna ratio ( r = 0.2 , p = 0.3 ) .
conclusion we found significant correlation between the aberrant prm ratio ( prm2 under expression ) and lower ybx2 mrna content in testicular biopsies of azoospermic men compared to controls , which suggested that downregulation of the ybx2 gene might be involved in prm2 under expression .
these molecules could be useful biomarkers for predicting male infertility .

introduction protamines ( prms ) comprise the largest amount of nucleoproteins in mature human sperm .
these proteins are transcribed in steps 1 - 4 of spermatids ( 1 ) while synthesis of the corresponding proteins starts , with temporal delay , in step 4 spermatids ( 2 ) .
during spermiogenesis , prms replace somatic histones in a step - by - step manner , and cause higher dna packaging in sperm compared to somatic cells .
on the other hand , the condensed and insoluble nature of the sperm chromatin protects the genetic integrity of the parental genome during its transport through the male and female reproductive tracts ( 3 ) .
various studies reported abnormal expressions of prm genes in sperm of infertile men .
in addition , correlation of the altered prm1 / prm2 ratio has been shown with low sperm counts , decreased sperm motility and morphology , decreased fertilization ability and increased sperm chromatin damage ( 4 - 7 ) .
several factors have been postulated and studied as possible causes of prm1 / prm2 deregulation ( 8 - 11 ) .
one of these candidate mechanisms is prm gene polymorphisms that have also been reported for prm1 , 2 genes .
however most of these studies suggest that none of the prms' single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) and transition protein genes is likely to be a common cause of prm abnormalities .
other factors that have attracted attention in this regard are transcription and translation regulatory genes of prm .
several genes and proteins involved in prm1 / prm2 expression regulation have been identified and presented ( 12 - 16 ) ; until now , modification of these factors in infertile men with prm deficiency attracted less attention .
in this study we have proposed two prm regulatory factors - y box binding protein 2 ( ybx2 ) gene and jmjc - containing histone demethylase 2a ( jhdm2a ) gene .
these genes encode two important proteins involved in regulation of prm1 / prm2 expressions ( 17 , 18 ) .
ybx2 is the human homologue of xenopus dna / rna - binding and mouse msy2 proteins ( 16 ) , animal model studies show that this protein exists abundantly in testis tissue and is expressed in meiotic and post - meiotic germ cells ( 17 ) .
ybx2 acts as an mrna stabilizer and a transcription factor of prm genes ( 18 , 19 ) .
consequently , ybx2 loss of expression is likely to contribute to the nuclear condensation defects that occur in msy2 - null latestage spermatids ( 20 ) .
jhdm2a specifically regulates the expression of genes that encode transition protein 1 ( tnp1 ) and prm1 ; this is necessary for proper chromatin reorganization during spermatid maturation by directly promoting transcription of tnp1 and prm1 genes ( 21 ) .
the current study analyzes the prms ratio in testicular tissue of azoospermic men .
as ybx2 and jhdm2a are involved in expression regulation of these genes , we have additionally evaluated whether prm deficiency is related to downregulation of these genes .
materials and methods testicular tissue this experimental study was approved by the ethical committee of the faculty of medical sciences of qazvin medical science university ( qazvin , iran ) .
after patients gave their informed written consent , testicular biopsies were obtained from 50 infertile men with a mean age of 31.3 +/ - 3.7 years ; these patients were candidates for assisted reproductive technique ( art ) and exhibited impaired spermatogenesis .
in 12 patients with obstructive azoospermia after vasectomy , biopsies were performed out for diagnostic reasons during vasectomy reversal .
these biopsies revealed normal spermatogenesis which served as controls ; the mean age of these individuals was 35 +/ - 2.9 years .
in this study patients were excluded if they had the following criteria : y chromosome microdeletion , cystic fibrosis , varicocele , klinefelter syndrome , or exposure to chemotherapy and radiation .
in nonobstructive azoospermia patients , one part of the testicular tissue specimen was used for testicular sperm extraction , while the other part was cut into two pieces .
one piece was immediately prepared and frozen for the rna extraction procedure and the other piece was fixed in bouin 's fixative , then embedded in paraffin .
histological evaluation we stained 5 mum paraffin sections in hematoxylin and eosin , and then scored the sections according to the modified johnsen scoring system for histological evaluation ( 22 ) .
in this system of classification , all tubular sections in each piece of the testicular biopsy are evaluated systematically , and each is given a score from 1 to 10 .
complete spermatogenesis with numerous spermatozoa is evaluated as score 10 ; slightly impaired spermatogenesis , numerous late spermatids , disorganized epithelium as score 9 , less than five spermatozoa per tubule and few late spermatids as score 8 , no spermatozoa , no late spermatids , and numerous early spermatids as score 7 , no spermatozoa , no late spermatids , and few early spermatids as score 6 ; no spermatozoa or spermatids , and many spermatocytes as score 5 , no spermatozoa or spermatids , and few spermatocytes as score 4 ; spermatogonia only as score 3 , no germinal cells and sertoli cells only as score 2 ; no seminiferous epithelium as score 1 ( 11 ) .
to follow this classification method , we divided the samples into two groups based on the above scoring : normal spermatogenesis ( scores 9 - 10 ) and impaired spermatogenesis ( scores 1 - 8 ) ( table 1 , fig . 1a - e ) .
it should be mentioned that our samples with score 8 had severe hypospermatogenesis .

rna extraction and first strand cdna synthesis after homogenizing frozen testis tissues using an ultrasonic processor up100h ( hielsher , germany ) , rna was extracted with an rneasy mini kit ( qiagene , germany ) .
the extracted rna was frozen at - 80 ( o ) c. we used a nano drop 2000c ( thermo , usa ) to evaluate the quantity of isolated total rnas .
in this regard , rna samples with a260 / a280 ratios of > 2 were selected for quantitative analysis .
first strand complementary dna ( cdna ) synthesis was also performed using the revert aid first strand cdna synthesis kit ( thermo scientific , fermentas , waltham , ma , usa ) .
real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( rt - qpcr ) we designed four target genes primers and probes ( prm1 , 2 , ybx2 and jhdm2a ) using gene runner softw are ( version 3.05 , table 2 ) .
a taq man rt - qpcr assay was carried out in final reaction volumes of 20 mul with 10 mul of taq man master mix ( takara , shiga , japan ) , 0.2 mum of forward and reverse primers , and 2 mul of cdna .
thermal cycling was performed on the abi - 7500 ( applied biosystems , foster , ca , usa ) sequence detection system by using the following cycling condition : 30 seconds at 95 ( o ) c as the first denaturation step , followed by 40 cycles at 95 ( o ) c for 5 seconds and 60 ( o ) c for 34 seconds .
each assay was repeated at least twice .
the log - ratio of the transcript content in the samples was determined by the deltact method of relative quantification .
the log - ratio of prm1 and prm2 was also calculated by deltact = ctprm2 - ctprm1 , for ybx2 and jhdm2a , these were deltact = ctybx2 - ctgapdh and deltact = ctjhdm2a - ctgapdh .
to study the correlation between ybx2 and jhdm2a mrna content and prm log concentration , we used the calculating pattern of steger et al .
( 6 ) .
since ct of prm1 did not change in the different groups , log - concentration of ybx2 and jhdm2a were normalized to prm1 ( deltact = ctybx2 - ctprm1 and deltact = ctjhdm2a - ctprm1 ) ( 23 ) .

statistical analysis in order to determine the significant differences between the studied groups , statistical analysis that included mean , standard deviation ( sd ) , correlation coefficients ( r2 ) and unpaired t test were performed with prism ( version 3 ) software .
additionally , linear correlations were tested using the pearson coefficient of correlation .
all tests were performed at a confidence level of 95 % .
results the mean ct of prm1 in testis tissues were almost identical , 23.4 +/ - 3.6 ( azoospermic ) and 23.3 +/ - 1.5 ( fertile ) .
the mean ct of prm2 in azoospermic men was 23.6 +/ - 1.8 and in the fertile group , it was 22.5 +/ - 0.41 .
hence the expression ratio of prm2 was lower than the prm1 expression ratio in azoospermic men .
the logarithm of the prm1 / prm2 mrna ratio in azoospermic men was 0.21 +/ - 0.13 and for fertile men , it was - 0.8 +/ - 0.22 .
this difference of ratios between fertile and azoospermic men was statistically significant ( p < 0.0001 , table 2 ) .
in testicular tissues of azoospermic men with impaired spermatogenesis , the fold change of ybx2 transcripts was 0.02 +/ - 0.019 , and the log ratio of ybx2 expression between azoospermic ( 5.1 +/ - 1.2 ) and fertile men ( 3.3 +/ - 0.99 ) significantly differed ( p < 0.0001 , table 2 ) .
in terms of jhdm2a gene expression , the differences of expression ratio were 6.1 +/ - 1.1 ( fertile ) and 6.3 +/ - 0.89 ( azoospermic ) , which was not significant ( p = 0.5 , table 2 ) .
the ybx2 mrna content revealed a positive linear correlation ( r = 0.6 , p = 0.007 ) with the prm1 / prm2 mrna ratio or with prm2 deficiency ( fig . 2a ) .
however , we observed no linear correlation between jhdm2a mrna content and the prm1 / prm2 mrna ratio ( r = 0.2 , p = 0.3 , fig . 2b ) .
fig.2 a. correlation between the protamine - 1 ( prm1 ) to prm2 log - ratio deltact ( prm2 - prm1 ) and normalized ybx2 log - concentration deltact ( ybx2 - prm1 , r = 0.6 , p = 0.007 ) and b. correlation between the prm1 to prm2 log - ratio deltact ( prm2 - prm1 ) and normalized jhdm2a log - concentration deltact ( jh - prm1 , r = 0.2 , p = 0.3 ) .
discussion in this research we observed a significant difference in prm1 / prm2 ratio between azoospermic and fertile men testicular biopsies ( 0.21 +/ - 0.13 , 0.8 +/ - 0.22 ) .
prm2 changes were more than prm1 , which suggested different mrna stabilities for the two molecules .
a variety of studies reported a relationship between abnormal prm1 / prm2 ratios and male infertility ( 4 - 6 , 21 , 23 ) .
on the basis of the studies which showed high prm1 / prm2 ratios , it has been supposed that a reduction in prm2 expressions was responsible for aberrant prm1 / prm2 ratios in infertile males .
along this line , two studies reported complete selective absence of prm2 in infertile men ( 4 , 24 , 25 ) .
lewis et al .
( 26 ) observed that in sperm of infertile men , prm2 downregulation occurred much more frequently than prm1 deregulation , because prm2 expression was more sensitive to the variation of regulatory controlling mechanisms than those for prm1 .
our results confirmed the results from the above studies ; we have observed significant downregulation of prm2 in the studied azoospermic men .
prms genes are only transcribed in round spermatids and stored as silent mrnas for later translation in elongating spermatids , in which transcription is no longer active .
since it is well justified to consider altered prms mrna levels as a potential origin of altered protein levels ( 1 , 11 , 27 ) , we have evaluated prm expression at the mrna level .
generally speaking , the mechanisms that underlie the uncoupling of prm1 and prm2 expression remain unclear , but generally four pathways in regulation of prm gene expression have received more attention : the prm genes themselves , transcription regulation , translation regulation , and downstream protein processing .
the prm1 and prm2 genes exist in a single chromatin domain in human sperm , and their transcription is regulated by the same upstream regulatory elements , thus making transcriptional and translational regulation a possible cause for aberrant prm1 / prm2 expression ( 28 , 29 ) .
there are a number of regulatory proteins identified which are involved in repression or activation of prm expression ( 29 ) .
in this regard , various animal models and in vitro studies have been performed , but scientists emphasize that future investigations should focus on aberrant expression , activation , and function of these regulatory factors in patients with deregulated prm1 / prm2 ratios ( 30 , 31 ) .
to this end , we have focused on the expression ratio of two factors of prm gene expressions .
ybx2 is a transcription and translation regulatory factor , and a germ - cell - specific molecule essential for the production of functional spermatozoa .
this gene is expressed in meiotic and post - meiotic germ cells , but its functional form is in round spermatids .
inactivation of ybx2 can lead to male infertility .
ybx2 , also known as contrin , is the human homologue of xenopus dna / rna - binding and mouse msy2 proteins ( 32 , 33 ) .
to clarify the functional role of msy2 in germ cells , yang et al .
( 19 ) have generated msy2 - null mice .
they found that mutant males had an abnormally high numbers of apoptotic meiotic spermatocytes , lacked spermatozoa in the epididymis , and were sterile .
their results emphasized the major role of this protein in male fertility ( 33 ) .
hammoud et al .
( 34 ) investigated ybx2 gene alterations in men with severe defects in spermatogenesis that included azoospermia , severe oligozoospermia , and prm deregulation samples .
their results showed 15 polymorphic sites , of which 7 polymorphisms were present at a statistically higher frequency in patients with infertility , particularly in men with abnormal prm expression .
on the same path they showed that some snps in the ybx2 gene occurred at a significantly higher incidence in men with prm abnormalities than the control group .
our results , accordingly , showed significant downregulation of this gene in testicular tissues of azoospermic men compared to fertile men .
in terms of the molecular function of this protein , animal models and in vitro assay studies have shown that msy2 acts as a transcription factor and an mrna stabilizer which regulates expression of some testis specific genes at the transcription and translation levels , such as prm1 , 2 .
msy2 marks specific mrnas ( those transcribed from y - box promoters ) in the nucleus for cytoplasmic storage , and thereby links mrna transcription and storage / translational delay .
in this process , msy2 recognizes the ctg attggc / tc / taa sequence , a dna motif in the promoter of numerous genes specifically expressed in male germ cells .
after binding msy2 to its consensus promoter sequence , it binds to transcripts of this gene , and stabilizes and represses their translation in cytoplasmic rna - protein complexes ( 19 , 35 - 38 ) .
since prm1 , 2 are regulated by the same upstream regulatory elements , we have expected significant under expression of ybx2 to cause simultaneous downregulation of prm1 , 2 in our azoospermic samples compared to fertile samples .
unlike our expectation prm2 downregulated in the studied samples .
we observed a positive linear correlation between downregulation of prm2 and ybx2 genes .
statistically , r = 0.6 exhibited an intermediate or good correlation , but this correlation was not perfect or 100 % .
this probably indicated that factors other than ybx2 were involved in prm2 downregulation .
consistent with our results , one study has shown that decreased prm1 protein level is usually linked with posttranslational deregulation , but decreased prm2 is associated with low prm2 mrna ( 30 ) .
prm2 transcripts are more susceptible to variations other than prm1 transcripts , downregulation of ybx2 affects prm2 transcripts more than prm1 ( 26 ) .
another regulatory factor studied in this research was jhdm2a , also known as jmjd1a or kdm3a , was identified as an h3k9 demethylase ( for monomethylation and dimethylation ) .
jhdm2a was originally cloned as a testis - specific gene transcript .
results of immune histochemical analysis using anti - jhdm2a antibody showed an intense nuclear expression of this gene in round spermatids and a sub - nuclear distribution .
co - expression of jhdm2a gene with rna polymerase ii indicated that jhdm2a might contribute to transcriptional activation of some testis specific genes .
jhdm2a has been shown to stimulate the transcriptional activation of transition nuclear protein1 and prm1 genes by bonding to the core promoter and removing h3k9 methylation ( 21 ) .
histone demethylase jhdm2a is critical for tnp1 and prm2 transcription and spermatogenesis .
jhdm2a - deficient mice have infertility and smaller testes .
despite the fact that animal model studies show the role of this protein in male infertility , we have not observed any significant difference in expression ratio of this gene between azoospermic and fertile men samples .
probably the role of this gene is not very influential in human spermatogenesis , and more samples must be studied .
regarding the correlation between this gene expression and prm2 downregulation our results have shown no positive linear correlation .
statistically , shows a weak or no correlation .
other studies have shown that this gene acts as a transcriptional activator of the prm1 gene .
in addition , our samples displayed downregulation of the prm2 gene ; therefore , expression of jhdm2a in our samples did not have an important role .
conclusion we found significantly aberrant prm mrna ratios and a lower ybx2 mrna content in testicular spermatids of infertile men .
in future studies the exact role of these molecules ( ybx2 and jhdm2a ) and other prm expression regulatory factors must be determined in human spermatogenesis .

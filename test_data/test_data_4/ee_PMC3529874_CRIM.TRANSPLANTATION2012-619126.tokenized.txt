allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo - hsct ) is a most powerful immunotherapy for hematological malignancies .
however , the impact of immunological disturbances as a result of allo - hsct is not understood well .
we experienced an 11 - year - old boy who presented with systemic lupus erythemathosus ( sle ) 10 years after unrelated cord blood transplantation of male origin for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( jmml ) with monosomy 7 .
bone marrow examination showed complete remission without monosomy 7 .
genetic analysis of peripheral blood revealed mixed chimera with recipient cells consisting of < 5 % of t cells , 50 - 60 % of b cells , 60 - 75 % of nk cells , 70 - 80 % of macrophages , and 50 - 60 % of granulocytes .
significance of persistent mixed chimera as a cause of sle is discussed .
1. introduction allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo - hsct ) is an effective treatment to cure the hematological malignancy through the alloimmune reaction .
however , excessive alloimmune reaction triggers acute graft versus host disease ( agvhd ) and it attacks various organs and induces their dysfunction , which is often life - threatening .
chronic gvhd is based on more insidious alloimmune reaction and its clinical symptoms sometimes mimic autoimmune diseases .
in allo - hsct , donor cells usually replace the bone marrow cells completely , which is called complete chimera .
donor and recipient hematopoietic cells sometimes coexist stably , which is called mixed chimera .
although mixed chimera is a sign of relapse of hematological malignancy , there are cases of stable and persistent chimera without relapse .
however , the impact of immunological disturbances as a result of allo - hsct and mixed chimera is not understood well .
we had an 11 - year - old boy who presented with sle 10 years after allogeneic cord blood transplantation .
interestingly , most of t cells were of donor origin , but b cells , nk cells , macrophages , and granulocytes were mixed chimera .
2. case report at 6 - month - old , he presented with hepatosplenomegaly and skin eruption .
bone marrow examination revealed monosomy 7 and he was diagnosed as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia through clinical evaluation .
at 15 - month - old , he received hla - drb1 one locus mismatched male - derived cord blood transplantation .
conditioning regimen was myeloablative ( busulfan ( 140 mg / m2 x 4 ) + etoposide ( 15 mg / kg / day x 4 ) + cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg / kg x 2 ) + antithymocyte globulin ( 2.5 mg / kg x 4 )) .
gvhd prophylaxis was cyclosporine and short - term methotrexate .
sct was successful with only mild gvhd .
complete chimera was determined on day 41 .
he has been free of immunosuppressant 8 months after sct .
10 years after sct , he complained of wrist and ankle pain .
blood examination revealed marked thrombocytopenia ( 1 x 104 / mul ) and he was admitted for further examination .
the hemogram at the regular checkup 8 months before admission was normal .
he was 164.5 cm and 54.7 kg. physical examination was unremarkable except for dispersed petechie on face , oral cavity , and extremities and mild swelling of both wrists .
the hemogram showed white blood cell of 2100 / mul , granulocyte of 168 / mul , hemoglobin of 12.1 g / dl , platelet of 0.3 x 104 / mul , and reticulocyte of 7.6 x 104 / mul .
serological examinations were c3 of 54 mg / dl ( 74 - 130 ) , c4 of 13 mg / dl ( 11 - 30 ) , ch50 of 26 u / ml ( 26 - 49 ) , igg of 1800 mg / dl , igm of 917 mg / dl , iga of 318 mg / dl , sil - 2r of 2720 u / ml ( 0 - 550 ) , antinuclear antibody of x1280 , anti - dna antibody of 37 iu / ml ( 0 - 6 ) , anti - dsdna antibody of 157 iu / ml ( 0 - 12 ) , anti - ssdna antibody of 269 u / ml ( 0 - 25 ) , anti - ss - a antibody of 7.0 u / ml ( 0 - 10 ) , anti - ss - b antibody of 7.0 u / ml ( 0 - 10 ) , anti - sm antibody of 7.0 u / ml ( 0 - 10 ) , and anti - rnp antibody of 7.0 u / ml ( 0 - 10 ) ( number in the parenthesis means the normal value ) .
antiplatelet antibody , antineutrophil antibody , and direct coombs test were positive .
bone marrow examination presented normocellular marrow with normal number of megakaryocytes , normal karyotype , and no atypical cells .
fish analysis detected no monosomy 7 cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood .
fcm analysis of peripheral lymphocytes revealed that cd3 : 79.6 % , cd4 : 38.1 % , cd8 : 36.1 % , cd19 : 9.6 % , and cd56 : 2.7 % .
cd4 + cd25 + cells comprised 9.8 % of cd4 + t cells .
he was diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus according to the international diagnostic criteria , and prednisolone ( psl ; 40 mg / day ) was started with the combination of high - dose gamma - globulin ( 1 g / kg ) for thrombocytopenia .
clinical response was rapid and remarkable .
lumbar puncture performed before the start of psl showed no abnormal findings .
urinalysis was normal , and renal biopsy performed after hematological remission presented no significant histological findings .
after 4 weeks , psl was gradually tapered , and 8 month later , psl was tapered as low as to 5 mg / day , when thrombocytopenia recurred .
responsiveness to psl was as well as at the initial treatment .
although a few serological relapse occurred along with the reduction of psl , he has been clinically and serologically remission on 10 - 15 mg of daily psl ( figure 1 ) .
3. chimerism analysis chimerism analysis was performed by comparing the three different pcr products of microsatellite regions ( d9s304 , d21s1437 , and d8s1179 ) which discriminate recipient from donor .
the cells from the buccal membrane and nails were used as recipient cells .
granulocytes were obtained by depleting the mononuclear cells by gradient - based centrifugation method .
t cells , b cells , nk cells , and macrophages were positively selected from the mononuclear cells by using anti - cd3 , anti - cd19 , anti - cd56 , and anti - cd14 antibody conjugated immunomagnetic beads .
at the onset of sle , recipient cells consisted of < 5 % of t cells , 50 - 60 % of b cells , 60 - 75 % of nk cells , 70 - 80 % of macrophages , and 50 - 60 % of granulocytes .
8 months later , recipient cells consisted of 40 - 50 % of white blood cells , 10 - 20 % of mononuclear cells , and 70 - 80 % of granulocytes .
3 year later , when he was in clinically and serologically remission on 12.5 mg of daily prednisolone , recipient cells still consisted of < 10 % of t cells , 50 - 60 % of b cells , 65 - 75 % of nk cells , 85 - 90 % of macrophages , and 85 - 95 % of granulocytes ( figure 2 ) .
4. discussion jmml is a hematological malignancy which is resistant to chemotherapy , and allo - sct is recommended to cure [ 1 , 2 ] .
concerning with the pathogenesis , genetic disturbances of ras signaling pathway has been disclosed recently [ 2 , 3 ] .
it has been reported that early mixed chimera is a warning of relapse in jmml [ 4 ] .
however , a few cases have been reported to keep long - term remission with the persistent mixed chimera after allogeneic cord blood transplantation [ 5 ] .
in some cases of jmml , autoantibody production has been also reported [ 6 ] .
at the onset of sle in this patient , relapse of jmml was excluded .
furthermore , mutation of ras and ptpn11 was not found in this patient at the onset of sle ( data not shown ) .
sle is a complex inflammatory disease which involves various organs .
the incidence is reported to be 10 - 150 cases per 100,000 population , and the women of childbearing age are mostly affected .
the incidence of pediatric sle is much less and it occurs rarely less than 5 - years old .
the genetic , environmental , and hormonal factors are considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of sle .
although , the recent advances of molecular biology have disclosed the genetic background of sle in detail , genetic involvements are multifactorial and complicated [ 7 , 8 ] .
generally speaking , pediatric sle is more active and severe than adult sle .
furthermore , involvement of kidney and cns is more frequently observed than adult sle [ 9 ] .
cns and kidney were intact in our case , and responsiveness to steroid was remarkable .
in this sense , our case is clinically atypical as a pediatric sle. from the immunological point of views , the basic pathogenesis of sle is a disturbance of immune regulations , which induces abnormal autoimmune responses .
it is well known that autoimmune diseases are occasionally complicated in the patients with persistent chronic gvhd [ 10 ] .
but sle after sct has been rarely reported in the literature .
it has been reported that autoimmune hemolytic anemia and cytopenias are observed in very young infants who received unrelated cord blood transplantation .
in their report , most of the autoimmune cytopenias occurred within two years after cord blood transplantation [ 11 ] .
there are rare case reports of patients developing autoimmune cytopenia from 6 - 9 years after cardiac transplantation , which requires life - long usage of calcineurin inhibitor [ 12 ] .
it is postulated that treatment of long - term calcineurin inhibitors may affect the developing thymus or function of regulatory t cells , resulting in the development of autoimmune diseases [ 13 ] .
in our patient , calcineurin inhibitor was used for only 8 months .
on the other hand , it has been reported that autoimmune diseases are frequently found in wiskott - aldrich syndrome patients with persistent mixed chimera after allo - hsct even in the absence of chronic gvhd [ 14 ] .
it is speculated that residual recipient cells are important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases after allo - hsct , because it is known that patients with wiskott - aldrich syndrome themselves are subject to autoimmune diseases [ 15 ] .
perruche et al. have reported that anti - dsdna antibody production is frequently observed in the persistent mixed chimera mice model induced by reduced - intensity conditioning [ 16 ] .
they have concluded that residual host - derived b cells but not dendritic cells are important in the production of autoantibody .
in our patient , majority of t cells are of donor origin , but half of b cells are of recipient origin , which is quite similar to mixed chimera mice model by saas et al. considering the age , sex , and family history , susceptibility to sle seems acquired , and persistent mixed chimera may be strongly related with the pathogenesis of sle in this patient .
it is not clear how long mixed chimera has continued in this patient .
he was hematologically normal just 8 months before the diagnosis of sle and the appearance of petechie was relatively acute - onset .
however , it seems that mixed chimera is stable from the persistence of mixed chimera for at least three years even in the remission of sle .
we would like to emphasize the clinical impact of persistent mixed chimera after sct on the immune development especially in very younger patients .
it is required to follow the chimerism status of patients who received allo - hsct for long period to elucidate the impact of allo - hsct on the immune development or disturbance in younger children .
this case is also unique and valuable to consider the pathogenesis of sle or autoimmune diseases .

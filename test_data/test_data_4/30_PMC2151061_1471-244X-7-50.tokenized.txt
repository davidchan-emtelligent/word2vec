background the overlap between depression and anxiety has led some researchers to conclude that they are manifestations of a broad , non - specific neurotic disorder .
however , others believe that they can be distinguished despite sharing symptoms of general distress .
the tripartite model of affect proposes an anxiety - specific , a depression - specific and a shared symptoms factor .
watson and clark developed the mood and anxiety symptom questionnaire ( masq ) to specifically measure these tripartite constructs .
early research showed that the masq distinguished between dimensions of depression and anxiety in non - clinical samples .
however , two recent studies have cautioned that the masq may show limited validity in clinical populations .
the present study investigated the clinical utility of the masq in a clinical sample of adolescents and young adults .
methods a total of 204 young people consecutively referred to a specialist public mental health service in melbourne , australia were approached and 150 consented to participate. from this , 136 participants completed both a diagnostic interview and the masq .
results the majority of the sample rated for an axis - i disorder , with mood and anxiety disorders most prevalent .
the disorder - specific scales of the masq significantly discriminated anxiety ( 61.0 %) and mood disorders ( 72.8 %) , however , the predictive accuracy for presence of anxiety disorders was very low ( 29.8 %). from roc analyses , a proposed cut - off of 76 was proposed for the depression scale to indicate ' caseness' for mood disorders .
the resulting sensitivity / specificity was superior to that of the ces - d. conclusion it was concluded that the depression - specific scale of the masq showed good clinical utility , but that the anxiety - specific scale showed poor discriminant validity .
background the tripartite model mood and anxiety disorders are often comorbid [ 1,2 ] .
this finding is not surprising given the symptom overlap between these two syndromes [ 3 ] .
a tripartite model of affect has been proposed to account for this overlap and to identify the unique components of anxiety and depression [ 4 ] .
under this model , negative affect ( na ) , a mixed anxiety - depression factor , explains the comorbidity between these syndromes .
positive affect ( pa ) is the depression - specific factor and physiological hyperarousal ( ph ) is unique to anxiety .
there is some evidence for the tripartite model for its ability to distinguish between depression and anxiety [ 5 - 9 ] .
however , some findings have suggested the need to modify the original model [ 10 ] .
for example , ph may only be related to panic disorder and , to a lesser extent , generalised anxiety disorder .
much of the research into the validity of the tripartite model has been conducted with measures that were not specifically designed to measure the tripartite constructs ( e.g. bdi , bai ) .
specific measures may be necessary to explore the utility of the model [ 11 ] .
the mood and anxiety symptom questionnaire the mood and anxiety symptom questionnaire ( masq ) was designed to be a specific measure of the tripartite model of affect [ 12,13 ] .
three general distress scales measure the postulated shared factor , na. a depression - ( anhedonic depression , ad ) and anxiety - specific ( anxious arousal , aa ) scale measures pa and ph respectively .
watson et al. reported good discriminant and convergent validity for the masq across five samples comprising college students , adults sampled from the community and patients presenting to a pain clinic .
factorial validity for the masq has been established in non - clinical samples , with three factors consistently found to best represent the data [ 7,13,14 ] .
however , a recent study employed confirmatory factor analysis with depressed and anxious patients and reported that the structure of the tripartite model was not confirmed in this clinical sample [ 15 ] .
additionally , two recent studies have questioned the discriminant validity of the masq in clinical samples [ 16,17 ] .
discriminant validity reflects the extent to which an instrument measures the construct it is purported to measure , without inadvertently measuring other domains / constructs .
buckby et al. reported that depressed participants rated higher than non - depressed participants on all masq scales , including the anxiety - specific aa. furthermore , they reported that participants with anxiety disorders did not score higher than participants without a current disorder on any scale .
boschen and oei [ 16 ] reported that although the masq scales significantly discriminated between anxiety and depression , there was little clinical utility in these findings as the maximum discrimination was only 70 % .
both studies cautioned future researchers to be mindful of the potential weakness of the masq 's validity in clinical samples and indicated that further research , including replication , was necessary to better understand this issue .
rationale and hypotheses boschen & oei [ 16 ] used a clinical sample of adults with mood and anxiety disorders .
a recent review has criticised researchers for unduly focusing on psychometric characteristics and neglecting sensitivity [ 18 ] .
using similar analyses to boschen & oei , the present study therefore attempted to replicate their findings in a clinical sample of adolescents and young adults in order to determine how generalisable those findings were .
people in the early stages of mental disorders may be especially receptive to treatment and may require more benign interventions than chronic populations [ 19 ] .
it is therefore important to be able to validly recognise psychological distress in people at - risk of mental disorder .
should the masq be determined to validly detect depression and anxiety , it could prove to be a useful tool that is easily administered by professions including gps and triage workers .
it was hypothesised that the masq would show marginal to weak criterion validity in the present sample .
a secondary aim was to compare the masq depression scale , ad , with the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale ( ces - d ) [ 20 ] .
the ces - d is a widely - used measure of depressive symptomatology that has been validated in both adult and adolescent samples [ 20,21 ] .
however , some researchers have questioned its specificity to depression .
for example , the ces - d has high reported correlations with anxiety measures and contains items that are not specific to depression .
the present study sought to determine whether the masq offered an improvement to this earlier measure .
methods ethics approval for this study was given by the local ethics board , the melbourne health research and ethics committee .
participants participants were 150 people aged 15 - 24 years consecutively referred to orygen youth health ( oyh ) , a specialist youth public mental health service in melbourne , australia .
sources of referral included family , gps , hospitals and school counsellors .
procedures between april and september , 2003 , all young people who were referred to oyh with non - psychotic disorders were approached by trained research interviewers .
consenting participants completed the masq and a diagnostic interview .
inter - rater assessments were conducted in approximately 15 % of the cases to ensure agreement between interviewers .
kappa values for mood ( 0.89 ) and anxiety diagnoses ( 0.80 ) were high .
the sample , setting and methodology have been described in greater detail elsewhere [ 22,23 ] .
measures mood and anxiety symptom questionnaire ( masq ) the masq is a 77 - item self - report questionnaire that assesses depressive , anxious and mixed symptomatology [ 12,13 ] .
three scales measure general distress : depressive symptoms ( 12 items ) , anxious symptoms ( 11 items ) and mixed symptoms ( 15 items ) .
there is also an anxiety - specific ( anxious arousal , 17 items ) and depression - specific scale ( anhedonic depression , 22 items ) .
higher scores reflect greater levels of symptomatology .
the reported internal consistency for each scale is excellent with coefficient alphas ranging from 0.78 to 0.92 .
structured clinical interview for dsm - iv ( scid - iv ) the scid - iv was administered to assess for axis - i disorders and is a semi - structured interview [ 24 ] .
all assessments were conducted by trained research interviewers .
cases were presented at weekly clinical meetings with experienced doctoral - level clinical psychologists confirming diagnoses .
centre for epidemiologic studies - depression scale ( ces - d ) the ces - d is a 20 - item self - report questionnaire that assesses depressive symptomatology [ 20 ] .
the psychometric properties of the ces - d have been established in both adult and adolescent samples [ 20,21 ] .
higher ces - d scores reflect greater levels of symptomatology .
results characteristics of the sample two hundred and four people met the study criteria during the recruiting phase. of the 150 consenting participants 14 did not return valid questionnaires , leaving a sample of 136 with useable data .
there was no significant demographic differences between those with , and without missing data .
a small proportion of participants (< 10 %) had several , random missing variables replaced with the expectation maximisation method [ 25 ] .
the mean age of participants was 18.11 years ( sd = 2.61 ) and the sample was comprised of 61 % females ( n = 83 ) .
there was no significant gender difference in masq scores .
there was a significant difference between adolescents ( age 15 - 17 ) and young adults ( age 18 - 24 ) on all masq scales except aa with older participants scoring higher .
the majority of the sample ( 80.1 % , n = 109 ) rated for a current axis - i disorder .
mood and anxiety disorders were most common .
the sample was split according to diagnostic status : mood disorder only ( no comorbid anxiety , n = 29 , 21.3 %) ; anxiety disorder only ( no comorbid mood , n = 22 , 16.2 %) ; comorbid anxiety - mood ( n = 35 , 25.7 %) ; and no anxiety or depression ( n = 50 , 36.8 %) .
the most common anxiety disorders were specific phobia ( 16.9 %) , social phobia ( 15.4 %) and panic disorder ( 11.0 %) .
post traumatic stress ( 8.1 %) , generalised anxiety ( 5.1 %) and obsessive compulsive ( 6.6 %) disorders were less frequent .
nearly half ( 46 %) of the no anxiety - mood group rated for another axis - i diagnosis ( including substance abuse / dependence and eating disorders ) .
prevalence of other disorders has been described elsewhere [ 2 ] .
descriptive statistics and correlational analyses means and standard deviations are presented in table 1 .
inter - correlations between all masq scales were uniformly high and statistically significant with the lowest correlation between the disorder - specific scales aa and ad ( r = 0.59 , see table 2 ) .
inter - correlations between aa : ad were inspected across the diagnostic groups .
this correlation was high in all groups rating for either a mood or anxiety disorder with the highest correlation in anxiety only ( r = 0.62 ) , followed by comorbid ( r = 0.60 ) and mood only ( r = 0.46 ) ( p < . 001 for all ) .
in contrast , aa : ad was only moderately correlated in the no anxiety / mood group ( r = 0.35 , p = 0.01 ) .
when examining those participants without any current diagnoses ( n = 27 ) , aa : ad were uncorrelated ( r = 0.18 , p = 0.36 ) .
this finding indicated a differential relationship for the correlation between those with ( r = 0.59 , p < . 001 , n = 109 ) and those without an axis - i disorder .
therefore , an independent samples t - test of the correlational coefficients was conducted [ 26 ] , showing a significantly higher correlation in a composite diagnosis group that included participants with any current disorder ( z = 4.04 , p < . 001 ) .

logistic regression analyses - predicting mood disorder to replicate earlier findings [ 16 ] logistic regression analyses were run with diagnostic status as the dependent variable .
in the first analysis , a dichotomous outcome variable was created reflecting presence ( n = 64 , 47.1 %) versus absence ( n = 72 ) of a mood disorder .
the depression - specific scale ad was included in the first block of covariates , the three gd scales in the second block and aa in the third block .
ad significantly predicted mood disorder ( chi2 ( 1 ) = 44.06 , p < . 001 ) .
the addition of the gd scales in the second block did not significantly increase the prediction of mood disorder ( p = 0.09 ) , nor did inclusion of aa at the third step ( p = 0.78 ) .
the overall predictive accuracy of ad for a mood disorder was 72.8 % ( 71.9 % for presence and 73.6 % for absence of a mood disorder ) .
logistic regression analyses - predicting anxiety disorder in the second analysis , presence ( n = 57 , 41.9 %) versus absence ( n = 79 ) of an anxiety disorder was the dependent variable .
the anxiety - specific scale aa was included in the first step , the gd scales in the second , and ad in the third step .
aa significantly predicted anxiety disorder ( chi2 ( 1 ) = 4.58 , p = 0.03 ) .
the gd scales did not increase the prediction ( p = 0.15 ) , nor did ad in the final step ( p = 0.79 ) .
the overall predictive accuracy of aa for an anxiety disorder was 61.0 % ( 29.8 % for presence and 83.5 % for absence ) .
roc analyses the roc curve allows researchers to graphically determine a test 's sensitivity and specificity [ 27 ] .
the area under the curve of a roc plot provides a score that ranges from 1 ( test is always correct ) to 0 ( test is never correct ) .
a score of 0.5 indicates that the result is no better than chance .
when comparing different tests , the one with the larger area under the curve is determined to be the better diagnostic tool .
in the first analysis , the dichotomous mood disorder variable was entered as the state variable and the disorder - specific scales aa and ad and the ces - d were entered as the test variables .
the roc plot for ad contained 81.8 % under the curve ( se = 0.04 , 95 % c.i .
= 0.75 , 0.89 ) , aa contained 72.3 % ( se = 0.04 , 95 % c.i .
= 0.64 , 0.81 ) and ces - d contained 78.7 % ( se = 0.04 , 95 % c.i. = 0.71 , 0.86 ) .
in the second analysis , the dichotomous anxiety variable was input as the state variable and the disorder - specific scales as the test variables .
the roc plot for aa contained 61.7 % under the curve ( se = 0.05 , 95 % c.i .
= 0.52 , 0.72 ) , ad contained 62.0 % ( se = 0.05 , 95 % c.i .
= 0.53 , 0.72 ) and ces - d contained 58.3 % ( se = 0.05 , 95 % c.i. = 0.48 , 0.68 ) .
the sensitivity and specificity of ad was further inspected to identify a potential cut - off to indicate ' caseness' for depression. by visually inspecting the roc for the largest area under the curve and by manually comparing various true positive and true negative rates , it was determined that an ad cut - off of 76 best reflected caseness ( sensitivity = 85 % , specificity = 65 %) .
these figures were then compared to ces - d ( cut - off = 24 ) .
ad is equivalent to , if not better than , the ces - d ( sensitivity = 84 % , specificity = 61 %) in discriminating mood disorders when utilising the proposed cut - off of 76 .
further analyses with aa were not run as this scale demonstrated poor discriminant validity ( see above ) ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
figure 1 roc analyses for anxiety diagnosis by aa , ad and ces - d. figure 2 roc analyses for mood diagnosis by aa , ad and ces - d. discussion the current study investigated the ability of the masq 's ad and aa scales to distinguish between anxiety and mood disorders .
we sought to assess the discriminant validity of the masq in a clinical sample of adolescents and young adults ( mean age = 18.11 years ) .
we attempted to replicate and extend statistical methods used by boschen & oei [ 16 ] , who had a sample of 470 adult patients with mood and anxiety disorders ( mean age = 34.30 years ) .
present results largely supported the earlier findings .
first , the disorder - specific scales aa and ad were significant predictors of the target dependent variable anxiety and depression respectively .
ad was superior to aa in predicting its target syndrome .
ad accurately predicted mood disorders ( 72.8 %) .
however , aa weakly predicted anxiety disorders ( 61 % of overall cases ) .
interestingly , aa predicted the absence of anxiety well ( 83.5 %) but very poorly predicted the presence of these disorders ( 29.8 %) .
these findings add further support to earlier analyses with the same sample [ 17 ] .
in that study we reported that depressed participants scored highly on all scales but that those rating for anxiety disorders were not distinguished from those without an axis - i disorder .
the present findings are comparable to those obtained by boschen & oei , who reported depression being predicted 66.4 % and anxiety 61.1 % of the time .
there are some notable differences between the present results and those of boschen & oei .
first , the slightly higher prediction of depression in the present study is related to a more accurate prediction of the presence of depressive disorder by ad in our sample .
in boschen & oei 's study , the presence of depression was only predicted 42.3 % of the time ( versus 71.9 % in the current study ) .
second , though the overall prediction of anxiety is identical across studies , very low prediction of anxiety disorder was reported in the current study but was high ( 81.5 %) in boschen & oei 's study .
third , the three masq general distress scales did not significantly increase the prediction above that explained by the disorder - specific scales in this replication .
they were significant predictors in the original study .
the roc analyses , were also supportive of the earlier findings reported by boschen & oei [ 16 ] , particularly for the weak utility of the aa scale .
results were more positive for ad. when implementing the proposed cut - off for the ad scale ( 76 or greater ) , 85 % of depressed participants were correctly identified .
the low true negative rate ( non - depressed participants incorrectly identified , 65 %) is comparable to that reported elsewhere with adolescent samples [ 28 ] .
as we have argued elsewhere [ 17 ] , anxiety and depressive syndromes may not yet be clearly distinguished in populations similar to the present sample , which may account for the masq 's failure to distinguish between them .
results from the present correlational analyses further illustrate the psychometric limitations of the masq in the present sample .
though specifically designed to distinguish distinct depressive , anxious and general distress syndromes , all five masq scales were highly inter - correlated .
the aa : ad correlation was lowest , but still highly and significantly correlated in all participants rating for a current axis - i disorder ( r = 0.59 ) .
this correlation is particularly high for scales that are supposedly separate constructs and provides further evidence for this measure 's limitations in clinical samples .
a closer inspection of this correlation in those participants without a current disorder revealed these disorder - specific scales were not correlated ( r = 0.18 ) .
these results provide further evidence that the masq , and hence the tripartite model , will require significant revision for use with clinical samples .
the results presented in the current study suggest that that anxiety - specific scale , aa , may be most in need of revision .
the present results provide further support for the notion that caution be employed by researchers when planning the use of the masq in clinical samples .
all scales are highly correlated , limiting the utility of the scale for distinguishing between anxiety and mood disorders .
results from both logistic regression and roc analyses showed that the depression - specific scale , ad , had good discriminant validity in detecting the presence of mood disorders and also demonstrated clinically useful sensitivity and specificity .
the anxiety - specific scale , aa , however , showed poor clinical utility in the present sample .
this may be because the anxiety construct of the tripartite model , ph , has been found to have heterogeneous relationship with anxiety disorders .
only panic disorder and , to a lesser extent , generalised anxiety disorder have been established to relate to ph [ 10 ] .
obsessive compulsive disorder and social phobia may be unrelated .
very few participants in the present sample rated for gad or panic disorder ( 11.0 and 5.1 % respectively ) , therefore it is not surprising that the aa scale did not demonstrate clinical utility .
further studies are necessary to elucidate this issue to better determine the settings under which the masq is most valid .
in support of the current results , a dutch translation of the masq found only limited uniqueness of the anxious - specific scale ( compared to negative affect ) [ 29 ] .
it may be that future revisions of the aa scale will require the addition of items that are representative of the spectrum of anxiety disorders .
the inclusion of items that relate to phobic avoidance and / or worrying may enhance the clinical utility of this scale .
at present , aa may be considered to assess primarily panic symptoms .
replication of current methods would also be beneficial in similar samples to establish the generalisability of the present findings .
though boschen & oei [ 16 ] concluded that both masq specific scales demonstrated weak clinical utility , we argue that the predictive utility of the ad scale ( 73 %) may be high enough for clinical and research use .
though the masq was not designed for this purpose , the ad scale may be superior to the widely - used ces - d in determining clinical ' caseness' for mood disorders .
a brief ( 22 item ) , cheap self - report screening tool that accurately discriminates three out of four people who may warrant specialist clinical services may be well - received by mental health triage workers .
though the present sample is not large , this is the first study that the authors are aware of that has attempted to define a clinical cut - off for a masq scale .
present results indicate that ad is slightly superior to the ces - d in the current sample .

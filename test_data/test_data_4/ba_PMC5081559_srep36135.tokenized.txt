the nf - kappab pathway regulates t cell development as well as t cell activation at multiple differentiation stages .
the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex ( lubac ) is composed of sharpin , hoil - 1l and hoip , and it is crucial for regulating the nf - kappab and cell death pathways .
however , little is known about the roles of lubac in t - cell development and activation .
here , we show that in t - hoipdeltalinear mice lacking the ubiquitin ligase activity of lubac , thymic cd4 + or cd8 + t cell numbers were markedly reduced with severe defects in nkt cell development .
hoipdeltalinear cd4 + t cells failed to phosphorylate ikappabalpha and jnk through t cell receptor - mediated stimulation .
mature cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in t - hoipdeltalinear mice underwent apoptosis more rapidly than control t cells , and it was accompanied by lower cd127 expression on cd4 + cd24low and cd8 + cd24low t cells in the thymus .
the enforced expression of cd127 in t - hoipdeltalinear thymocytes rescued the development of mature cd8 + t cells .
collectively , our results showed that lubac ligase activity is key for the survival of mature t cells , and suggest multiple roles of the nf - kappab and cell death pathways in activating or maintaining t cell - mediated adaptive immune responses .
t cells express the t cell receptor ( tcr ) that recognizes a peptide presented by the mhc .
t cells subsequently differentiate toward various effector cells that are required for combating microorganisms or tumor cells1234 .
importantly , excessive activation of effector t cells can lead to various diseases including autoimmune disorders5.cd4 + cd8 + cells in the thymus receive tcr signals and the quantity or the quality of tcr signaling dictates the differentiation to mature cd4 + or cd8 + t cells678 .
th - pok and runx3 are crucial transcription factors modulating the lineage differentiation to cd4 + or cd8 + t cells , respectively9101112 .
the relationship between tcr signaling and transcriptional regulation remains unclear .
in the thymus , the differentiation of t cells beyond the cd4 + cd8 + cell stage requires persistent tcr signaling1314 .
moreover , il - 7 receptor signaling is crucial for the final maturation or survival of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in the thymus1516 .
the nf - kappab family includes five related proteins , c - rel , p65 , relb , p50 and p52 .
those proteins form homodimers and heterodimers in specific combinations together with a regulatory protein , the inhibitor ikappab17 .
a variety of extracellular signals engage the nf - kappab pathway through signaling networks that converge on the ikappab kinase ( ikk ) complex comprised of ikkalpha and ikkbeta together with a regulatory protein , ikkgamma ( nemo ) .
the phosphorylation of ikkbeta leads to the phosphorylation of ikappab , triggering the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ikappab , allowing nf - kappab dimers to translocate to the nucleus .
the nf - kappab pathway plays important roles in t cell development and inflammatory responses .
when thymocytes are conditionally deficient for nemo , the mice produced far fewer (< 10 %) mature cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in the spleen than did control mice18 .
the deficiency of ikkbeta reduced the number of mature t cells in the spleen to 20 - 50 % of those in control mice18 .
however , the specific roles of the distinct nf - kappab family members in thymocyte differentiation and maturation following tcralphabeta repertoire selection remain poorly defined .
in this regard , ubiquitin chains are assembled by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex ( lubac ) .
this complex constitutes a regulatory unit of the nf - kappab pathway , contributing to its activation19202122 .
lubac is composed of three proteins , hoip ( rnf31 ) , hoil - 1l ( rbck1 ) and sharpin2021 .
lubac - mediated ubiquitination of nemo activates nf - kappab with linear ubiquitin chains , which is required for ikkbeta phosphorylation , resulting in degradation of ikappabalpha .
one paper reported that an inherited mutation in hoip caused multi - organ autoinflammation , combined immunodeficiency , subclinical amylopectinosis and systemic lymphangiectasia23 .
however , the precise role of hoip or lubac ligase activity in t cell development is poorly understood .
here , we demonstrated that t cell - specific t - hoipdeltalinear mice showed impairments of mature t cell development and proliferative responses .
those data highlighted the hoip - mediated nf - kappab pathway as a crucial pathway in the regulation of t cell development .
furthermore , our data indicated that deficiency of lubac ligase activity disturbed the development of mature t cells and their function , suggesting the important role of lubac for t cell - mediated adaptive immune responses .
results the deficiency of rnf - 31 ligase activity in t cells impaired the development of mature t cells in the thymus to evaluate the involvement of hoip in t cell development , we established rnf31deltalinear / deltalinear mice with a cd4 - cre transgene ( t - hoipdeltalinear mice ) .
the frequency of tcrbeta + cells in the thymus was reduced in t - hoipdeltalinear mice and the relative and absolute numbers of cd4 + cd8 - and cd4 - cd8 + cells were markedly reduced in t - hoipdeltalinear mice whereas cd4 + cd8 + cells were not depressed ( fig. 1a,b ) .
the effect was much stronger in cd4 - cd8 + cells than cd4 + cd8 - cells .
the frequency of tcrbeta + cells in t - hoipdeltalinear mice was equivalent to that of rnf31 +/+ mice with cd4 - cre transgene ( hoip +/+) mice ( fig. 1a ) .
mature cd4 - cd8 + cells and cd4 + cd8 - t cells in the thymus downregulate cd24 and cd69 during the final maturation steps15 .
t - hoipdeltalinear mice had relatively higher frequencies of cd24 - positive and cd69 - positive cells in both cd4 + cd8 - tcrbeta + and cd4 - cd8 + tcrbeta + fractions than did hoip +/+ mice ( fig. 1c ) .
these results suggested that hoip - mediated ligase activity was required for final maturation or survival of mature cd4 + cd8 - and cd4 - cd8 + t cells in the thymus .
t - hoipdeltalinear mice had lower numbers of mature t cells in the spleen and lymph nodes we next assessed the t cell numbers and phenotypes in the spleen and lymph nodes of t - hoipdeltalinear mice .
the relative frequencies of tcrbeta + to tcrgamma + cells or tcrbeta + cells to b220 + cells was markedly reduced in the spleen and lymph nodes of t - hoipdeltalinear mice ( fig. 2a ) .
the total cell numbers of tcrbeta + , cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in the spleen and lymph nodes in t - hoipdeltalinear mice were also much less than in control mice ( fig. 2a ) .
the relative frequency of cd8 + cells to cd4 + cells was reduced in hoip - / - mice in the spleen ( fig. 2a ) .
t - hoipdeltalinear mice possessed higher numbers of cd44hicd62llocd4 + and cd44hicd62llocd8 + t cells compared with control mice ( fig. 2b ) , suggesting that mature t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice had undergone activation after being exported from the thymus .
the relative frequency of cd4 + foxp3 + regulatory t cells in cd4 + t cells was not affected in the lymph nodes of t - hoipdeltalinear mice ( fig. 2c ) , whereas the frequency of cd4 + cd1d tetramer + nkt cells was reduced in the thymus and liver of t - hoipdeltalinear mice ( fig. 2d ) .
taken together , those data demonstrated that hoip - deficiency in t cells markedly impaired the differentiation or survival of both mature cd4 + and cd8 + t cells with striking defects in the development of nkt cells .
cd4 + t cells in t - hoipdeltalinear mice proliferated poorly after tcr ligation we evaluated the in vitro proliferative ability of cfse - labeled cd4 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice when stimulated by anti - cd3 mab exposure .
those cd4 + t cells showed less cfse dilution than did control cells , indicating relatively slower proliferative activity ( fig. 3a ) .
the poorer proliferative activity of cd4 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice was not rescued by the addition of il - 2 to the culture medium ( fig. 3a ) .
to assess the role of hoip in the functional differentiation of cd4 + t cells , we immunized t - hoipdeltalinear mice and hoip +/+ mice with ova protein and evaluated anti - ova specific immunoglobulin production and levels of serum cytokine 14 days after immunization .
the cd4 + t cells from ova - immunized t - hoipdeltalinear mice produced lower amounts of ifn - gamma than those from hoip +/+ mice ( fig. 3b ) and failed to produce anti - ova - specific igg , igg1 and igg2c ( fig. 3c ) .
cd4 + t cells in t - hoipdeltalinear mice failed to phosphorylate ikappabalpha we assessed the role of hoip ligase in the activation of nf - kappab in mature t cells .
thus , cd4 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice and hoip +/+ mice were stimulated by anti - cd3 mab and phosphorylation of ikappabalpha was evaluated .
anti - cd3 mab treatment of cd4 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice induced less phosphorylation of ikappabalpha than observed in cells from control mice ( fig. 4a ) .
we then analyzed nuclear translocation of nf - kappab ( p65 ) after anti - cd3 mab - stimulation of cd4 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice or hoip +/+ mice .
little nuclear translocation of p65 was found in cd4 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice compared with efficient translocation of p65 into the nucleus in control t cells ( fig. 4b ) .
the deficiency of hoip ligase activity in b cells disturbs cd40 but not b cell receptor - mediated jnk activation24 .
thus , we analyzed tcr - mediated jnk phosphorylation in t - hoipdeltalinear mice t cells .
stimulation with anti - cd3 mab induced less phosphorylation of jnk in hoip ligase - deficient t cells compared with control cells ( fig. 4c ) .
those data demonstrated that the deficiency of hoip ligase activity disturbed activation of not only the canonical nf - kappab pathway but also the jnk pathway .
t cells from hoip - deficient mice lost viability we sought to assess whether the loss of mature t cells in t - hoipdeltalinear mice was attributable to increased cell death .
thus , mature cd4 + or cd8 + t cells from the thymus and spleen were stained with annexin v and 7aad .
larger percentages of cd8 + t cells in the thymus and cd4 + or cd8 + t cells in the spleen of t - hoipdeltalinear mice were positive for annexin v than in control cells ( fig. 5a ) .
those data suggested that the deficiency of hoip ligase activity increased the frequency of cell death in mature t cells , especially in early developmental stages of single positive cells in the thymus .
to confirm that cd4 + or cd8 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice did not retain viability , we compared cell survival of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice and hoip +/+ mice .
when cd4 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice ( cd45.2 ) and control ( cd45.1 ) mice were cultured in vitro without any stimulation or after stimulation with anti - cd3 mab , t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice died more rapidly than those from hoip +/+ mice ( fig. 5b ) .
to determine if the impaired t cell survival also occurred in vivo , cd4 + t cells ( cd45.2 ) from t - hoipdeltalinear mice or hoip +/+ mice were transferred into recipient c57bl / 6 ( cd45.1 ) mice .
the number of cd4 + cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice was much lower than control cells 3 days after transfer into inguinal lymph nodes , ( fig. 5c ) .
those results suggested that cd4 + t cells from hoip - / - mice were prone to die compared with control cd4 + t cells .
cd127 expression was lower in t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice in order to determine the molecular mechanisms for impaired development of t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice , we tested the expression of cytokine receptors on t cells .
the expression levels of common gamma - chain ( cd132 ) were comparable between cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in t - hoipdeltalinear mice and hoip +/+ mice ( fig. 6a ) .
however , the expression levels of il - 2ralpha ( cd25 ) and il - 2rbeta ( cd122 ) were higher in splenic cd8 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice .
moreover , the expression levels of il - 7ralpha ( cd127 ) were relatively high in cd4 + and cd8 + splenic t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice ( fig. 6a ) .
in contrast , the expression of cd127 was lower in thymic cd4 + and cd8 + t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice ( fig. 6b ) .
il7r ( cd127 ) was reported to be a target gene for nf - kappab signaling25 .
as il - 7 is required for cd8 + t cell survival , we examined if impaired development of t cells from t - hoipdeltalinear mice was attributable to low cd127 expression .
cd127 - encoding retrovirus was infected in fetal thymocytes from t - hoipdeltalinear mice .
the gfp - expressing thymocytes were cultured in fetal thymus for 7 days and the development of mature t cells was examined .
the overexpression of cd127 increased the frequency of mature cd8 + tcrbeta + but not cd4 + tcrbeta + t cells ( fig. 6c ) .
those data indicated that impaired cd8 + t cell survival in t - hoipdeltalinear mice is , at least partly , attributable to low cd127 expression .
discussion lubac - mediated poly - linear ubiquitination is a crucial event for activating the nf - kappab pathway2120 .
however , the roles of lubac - mediated nf - kappab regulation in t cell activation or in development have been unresolved .
in this paper , we show that among the lubac components , hoip ligase activity is required for the development of mature t cells and is crucial for cd4 + t cell proliferation .
t - hoipdeltalinear mice t cells failed to upregulate cd127 , which was attributable to the impaired survival of thymic cd8 + t cells but not cd4 + t cells in t - hoipdeltalinear mice .
these findings demonstrate the crucial contribution of hoip - mediated linear ubiquitination of nemo to t cell development .
they support a model in which cd4 + and cd8 + t cells have distinct molecular requirements for nf - kappab - mediated molecules downstream .
t cell development in the thymus is controlled by a multistep process utilizing the tcr , costimulatory molecules and cytokine signals , each of which is required during specific stages of development .
given that the tcr and cytokines signaling are crucial for t cell development , with nf - kappab downstream for various receptors in conventional t cells , hoip could control thymic t cell differentiation at multiple points .
our data demonstrated that mature cd4 + or cd8 + t cells were markedly diminished with reduced expression of cd127 in t - hoipdeltalinear mice , a deficit that was rescued by overexpressing cd127 on cd8 + t cells , at least in an in vitro culture system .
il - 7 functions in the survival and development of conventional cd4 + and cd8 + t cells , as evidenced by a markedly reduced number of mature cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in cd127 - deficient mice15 .
therefore , the impaired survival of cd8 + t cells in t - hoipdeltalinear mice could be , at least partially , attributable to the reduced expression of cd127 .
in contrast , the development of cd4 + t cells could not be rescued by overexpressing cd127 , suggesting that the dysregulation of other target molecules downstream from hoip is responsible for the impaired survival of cd4 + t cells .
those data suggest a model in which cd4 and cd8 t cells require distinct regulation of target molecules downstream of hoip for their survival in the thymus .
hoip complexes with hoil - 1l and sharpin2622 .
mutations in the murine sharpin gene cause spontaneous chronic proliferative dermatitis ( cpdm ) that develops into psoriasis - like proliferative skin lesions , splenomegaly , absence of peyer 's patches and low levels of serum immunoglobulin27 .
a recent study reported that patients with a loss - of - function mutation in hoil - 1l suffered from chronic autoinflammation , invasive bacterial infections and muscular amylopectinosis28 .
furthermore , an inherited mutation in hoip causes multi - organ autoinflammation , combined immunodeficiency , subclinical amylopectinosis , and systemic lymphangiectasia23 .
these findings suggest a distinct requirement for each lubac subunit to control downstream pathways .
in contrast to the autoinflammatory phenotypes associated with hoip - or hoil - 1l - deficiency in humans , the present study revealed that a deficiency in hoip ligase activity impaired nf - kappab activation leading to the impairment of both cd4 + and cd8 + t cell development without any inflammatory responses .
as lubac ligase activity was deleted only in t cells in our mouse study , the loss of function of non - t cells might be involved in the development of inflammatory responses .
the cbm ( carma1 - bcl10 - malt1 ) tcr adaptor complex regulates tcr - dependent nf - kappab activation293031 .
despite the important roles of carma1 in nemo activation , carma1 - deficient mice have normal t - cell development and normal peripheral t - cell numbers and ratios3233 .
however , they do have a defect in the development of intrathymic cd4 + cd25 + regulatory t cells34 .
in contrast , t cell - specific , nemo - deficient mice are devoid of mature cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in the thymus18 , a finding that is similar to t cell - specific , hoip ligase activity deficient mice .
furthermore , hoi - ligase activity deficient cd4 + t cells have a defect in tcr - mediated proliferation and nf - kappab activation .
those results suggest that the engagement of tcr activates nemo by utilizing carma1 - dependent or - independent pathways , and that lubac - mediated linear ubiquitination of nemo through engagement of tcr is essential for the survival of mature t cells .
in addition , a recent paper revealed that lubac integrates the cbm complex and that nf - kappab reporter activity is stimulated following antigen receptor ligation independent of its catalytic activity35 .
however as this study was performed by evaluating nf - kappab reporter activity in jurkat cells that had been transfected with sirna against hoip and sirna resistant ligase activity - inactive hoip , the effect of the residual activity of endogenous hoip might not be negligible .
in future studies , it will be necessary to evaluate which domains of hoip are crucial for binding with the cbm complex .
in this report , we found that canonical nf - kappab signaling through linear ubiquitination by lubac was an essential molecular pathway that regulated cd4 + and cd8 + t cell development .
our data highlight a previously unknown molecular link between lubac and mature cd4 + and cd8 + t cell survival .
those data also suggest new approaches for inhibiting hoip ligase activity and thereby suppressing t - cell - mediated immune responses .

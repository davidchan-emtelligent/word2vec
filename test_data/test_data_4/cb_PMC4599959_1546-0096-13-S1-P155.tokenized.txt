it has been suggested that in some cases it might be an unrecognized auto - inflammatory disease .
recent studies have demonstrated that anakinra , an interleukin - 1 receptor antagonist ( il - 1ra ) , represents an effective treatment for the control of corticosteroid - dependent cases .
objectives here we describe a case of cortico - dependent recurrent pericarditis with a different response to two il - 1 blocking agents , anakinra and canakinumab .
materials and methods case report .
results a 11 - year - old boy was admitted to our hospital with acute precordial pain , orthopnea , fever and increased levels of acute phase reactants .
acute pericarditis was confirmed by echocardiography and a treatment with prednisone was started with prompt clinical improvement .
pericarditis recurred twice during steroid tapering ( at 1mg / kg / day and 0.5mg / kg / day respectively ) .
after exclusion of infectious origin , therapy with anakinra ( 2mg / kg / day ) was established ( to avoid long term steroid side effects ) followed by dramatic clinical response and normalisation of laboratory findings despite tapering and discontinuation of prednisone .
treatment with anakinra was discontinued after 5 months with recurrence of pericarditis one week later .
anakinra was resumed with an excellent response .
five months later , while being in complete remission , anakinra was replaced with canakinumab ( 2mg / kg / dose ) due to patient 's intolerance of daily injections .
one week later , the patient experienced a new episode of pericarditis requiring corticotherapy .
two more relapses occured during steroid tapering , after 6 weeks and 2 months , in spite of the uptitration of canakinumab to 4mg / kg / dose .
anakinra was restarted with prompt clinical and biological remission and prednisone was discontinuated without recurrence of pericarditis .
four weeks later , anakinra was spaced out every 2 days and a treatment of colchicine was added .
after further 12 weeks follow - up under anakinra and colchicine , the pericarditis is still in remission .
conclusion we describe a case of steroid - dependent rp with a dramatic therapeutic response to il - 1ra ( anakinra ) but without response to il - 1beta monoclonal antibody ( canakinumab ) .
this unexpected observation could suggest that il - 1alpha might have a role in the pathogenesis of rp. a more precise usefulness of each il - 1 blocking agent requires confirmation in prospective controlled trials .

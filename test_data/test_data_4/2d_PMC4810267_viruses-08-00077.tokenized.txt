more than two thirds of emerging viruses are of zoonotic origin , and among them rna viruses represent the majority .
ceratopogonidae ( genus culicoides ) are well - known vectors of several viruses responsible for epizooties ( bluetongue , epizootic haemorrhagic disease , etc. ) .
they are also vectors of the only known virus infecting humans : the oropouche virus .
female midges usually feed on a variety of hosts , leading to possible transmission of emerging viruses from animals to humans .
in this context , we report here the analysis of rna viral communities of senegalese biting midges using next - generation sequencing techniques as a preliminary step toward the identification of potential viral biohazards .
sequencing of the rna virome of three pools of culicoides revealed the presence of a significant diversity of viruses infecting plants , insects and mammals .
several novel viruses were detected , including a novel thogotovirus species , related but genetically distant from previously described tick - borne thogotoviruses .
novel rhabdoviruses were also detected , possibly constituting a novel rhabdoviridae genus , and putatively restricted to insects .
sequences related to the major viruses transmitted by culicoides , i.e. , african horse sickness , bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease viruses were also detected .
this study highlights the interest in monitoring the emergence and circulation of zoonoses and epizooties using their arthropod vectors .
viral metagenomics biting midges zoonoses epizooties thogotovirus rhabdovirus 1 .
introduction there are more than 200 viral species that are known to be able to infect humans .
since the discovery of the yellow fever virus in 1901 , three to four new species have been discovered every year [ 1 ] .
there is , however , a substantial pool of unknown human viral species which are yet to be discovered , and the development and democratisation of next - generation sequencing techniques ( ngs ) has enabled the identification of many new viruses , for which the potential risk to humans remains mostly unknown .
more than two - thirds of viral species infecting humans are of zoonotic origin , and rna viruses represent more than 70 % of these [ 1,2 ] , resulting in the recent increase in studies of viral communities of wild and domestic animals [ 3 ] .
however , and despite the fact that haematophagous arthropods usually act as vectors of transmission between animals and humans , few studies have analysed viral communities of arthropods [ 3 ] .
the studies that have been previously conducted have focused on mosquito viromes [ 4,5,6,7,8 ] and have reported the discovery of novel viruses , including bunyaviruses , rhabdoviruses , reoviruses , and flaviviruses .
more recently , two studies described the composition of viral communities of hard ticks [ 9,10 ] and reported the identification of novel viruses belonging to the nairovirus , phlebovirus , and flavivirus genera , highlighting , as for mosquitoes , potential new zoonotic risks to humans .
ceratopogonidae , and particularly the genus culicoides , are small ( 1 - 3 mm ) and highly diverse midges , with more than 1300 species around the world [ 11,12 ]. of these , 96 % are haematophagous and only the females require blood meal for egg fertilisation .
biting midges are well - known vectors of several parasites ( such as mansonella sp . )
[ 13,14 ] and viruses infecting animals ( i.e. , bluetongue virus , african horse sickness virus , epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus , schmallenberg virus , etc . )
[ 15 ] .
the oropouche virus is the only human virus known to be transmitted by biting midges in latin and south america [ 16 ] .
we report here the first comprehensive analysis of viral communities from senegalese culicoides biting midges and the identification of several novel viruses , including a novel thogotovirus and a novel rhabdovirus .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
sample collection biting midges were collected using a modified centers for disease control ( cdc ) light trap in the villages of dielmo and ndiop in the sine - saloum region of senegal , in november 2013 .
traps were placed near places where cattle rested and were left overnight .
morphological identification of the arthropods was conducted the following morning .
three types of pools of arthropods were created : ste0043 ( more than 200 adult culicoides sp. , with no distinction between male and female , or engorged status ) ; ste0044 ( n = 15 engorged female culicoides imicola ) and ste0045 ( n = 100 non - engorged male and female culicoides imicola ) .
2.2 .
virome preparation the three pools of arthropods were crushed with two 3 mm tungsten beads and a tissuelyser at 25 hz for two minutes ( qiagen , courtaboeuf , france ) .
the clarified supernatant was subsequently used as a template for virome preparation , as previously described [ 17 ] .
briefly , the clarified supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 microm filter ( millipore , molsheim , france ) , and free nucleic acids were digested with a cocktail of nucleases .
finally , the digested supernatant was purified onto a discontinuous 66 % - 30 % sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged at 130,000 g for two hours at + 4 degreesc on a mls - 50 rotor ( beckman - coulter , villepinte , france ) .
the viral fraction was harvested at the interphase between the 66 % and 30 % sucrose layers .
total rnas were extracted from the purified viral fraction with trizol ls ( r ) reagent ( life technologies , saint aubin , france ) , according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
random amplification was performed using the froussard [ 18 ] random rt - pcr. and amplification products were purified with agencourt ampure beads ( beckman - coulter , villepinte , france ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol , eluted to a final volume of 15 microl and sequenced using miseq technology using paired - end and barcode strategies according to a nextera xt library kit in a 2 x 300 bp format ( illumina inc. , san diego , ca , usa ) .
2.3 .
bioinformatic analyses of viromes raw reads were imported in pairs into the clc genomics workbench 6.0.1 programme ( clc bio , aarhus , denmark ) and trimmed according to their quality score , the presence of ambiguities , and their length ( reads which were shorter than 50 nt were discarded ) .
the pre - processed viral metagenomes are publicly available on the metavir server [ 19 ] under the " arthrovirome " project and on the mg - rast server [ 20,21 ] with the identifiers 4604249.3 , 4604250.3 , and 4604251.3 for the ste0043 , ste0044 and ste0045 rna viromes , respectively .
cleaned paired reads were assembled into contigs using the clc genomics programme and the following parameters : word size of 20 nt , minimum contig length of 200 nt , mismatch cost of 2 , insertion / deletion cost of 3 , length fraction of 0.5 and similarity fraction of 0.8 .
contigs and non - assembled reads were compared to the ncbi nucleotide database using the blastn algorithm , with a minimum coverage of 50 % , minimum identity of 50 % and e - value < 10 - 5 .
sequences having no significant hits according to the criteria described above were classified as " unknown " .
contigs were then compared to the ncbi viral database using the blastx program with a minimum coverage of 50 % , minimum identity of 50 % and e - value < 10 - 5 .
finally , to confirm the specificity of the blastx result , contigs were compared to the ncbi non - redundant nucleotide database using the same criteria .
the taxonomic assignation of contigs was conducted by selecting the best blastx score result between the two blast run for each contig .
figure s1 presents the pipeline for bioinformatic analyses .
principal component analysis ( pca ) was used to compare data in the mg - rast server [ 21 ] with a maximum e - value of 10 - 5 , a minimum identity of 60 % , and a minimum alignment length of 15 amino - acids for protein and 15 bp for rna databases .
data were normalised to values between 0 and 1 , and distances were measured using the bray - curtis distance matrix .
2.4 .
phylogenetic analyses contigs with a significant hit for viruses were translated , and predicted open reading frames ( orfs ) were aligned with other amino - acid sequences retrieved from the genbank database using muscle aligner [ 22 ] implemented through mega6 [ 23 ] .
the amino - acid substitutions models that best fitted the data were performed on mega6 and were considered for all phylogenetic analyses .
the best substitution model was selected using the corrected akaike information criterion .
phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum likelihood ( ml ) implemented through the mega6 package software , according to the selected substitution model .
nodal support was evaluated using 1000 bootstrap replicates .
bayesian phylogenetic inference ( bi ) was carried out using mrbayes [ 24 ] with two independent runs of four incrementally - heated , metropolis - coupled markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) starting from a random tree .
the mcmc were run for 106 iterations and associated model parameters were sampled every 500 generations .
the initial 2000 trees in each run were discarded as burning samples and the harmonic mean of the likelihood was calculated by combining the two independent runs .
molecular evolutionary distances between sequences were calculated using mega6 [ 23 ] .
for analysis of evolutionary distances between thogotoviruses , individual sequences available in genbank and the p - distances algorithm were used .
for analysis of molecular evolutionary distances between rhabdoviruses , sequences available in genbank were grouped according to their recognised or putative genus ( defined by phylogenetic analyses ) and distances were calculated ( i ) within genera using the p - distance algorithm ( ii ) between genera using net distance calculations ( i.e. , mega6 takes into account the mean distance within genera ) and the p - distance algorithm .
2.5 .
transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) approximately 50 mg of ste0043 arthropod samples were washed in 70 % ethanol and crushed in 2 ml of sterile emem medium ( life technologies ) .
the supernatant was harvested after low speed clarification and subsequently filtered through a 0.8 - microm filter ( millipore ) followed by ultracentrifugation onto a discontinuous 66 % - 30 % sucrose gradient at 130,000 g for two hours at + 4 degreesc .
the viral fraction was harvested at the interphase between the 66 % and 30 % sucrose layers and fixed for one hour at + 4 degreesc with 2 % final glutaraldehyde .
the fixed viral fraction was then diluted to a final volume of 4 ml in pbs and directly adsorbed onto formvar carbon films on 400 mesh nickel grids ( fcf400 - ni , ems ) by ultracentrifugation at 130,000 g for one hour at + 4 degreesc , as previously described [ 25 ] .
grids were stained for 10 seconds with 1 % molybdate solution in filtered water at room temperature .
electron micrographs were obtained on a tecnai g2 transmission electron microscope ( fei ) operated at 200 kev equipped with a 4096 x 4096 pixel resolution eagle camera ( fei ) .
3. results 3.1 .
diversity of viral communities in haematophagous biting midges rna viromes of samples ste0043 , ste0044 and ste0045 were sequenced using illumina miseq technology .
sequencing statistics are presented in table 1 .
the taxonomic assignment of reads identified only 5 % - 25 % of sequences which had similarities with known sequences ( figure 1a ). of these , eukaryotes represented the majority of sequences , with 72.52 % , 62.10 % and 83.95 % of total known reads of the ste0043 , ste0044 and ste0045 rna viromes , respectively ( figure 1a ) .
most eukaryotic reads were assigned to arthropods (> 60 % of total eukaryotic reads ) , and they mainly consisted of arthropod ribosomal rnas .
bacteria - related sequences ranged from 9 % to 37 % depending on the sample ( figure 1a ) .
virus - related sequences represented 0.73 % - 18.48 % of total known reads. of them , plant viruses ( i.e. , partitiviridae , tymoviridae ) composed 15.48 % , 10.10 % and 0.00 % of total viral reads for ste0043 , ste0044 and ste0045 rna viromes , respectively ( figure 1b ) .
insect viruses ( i.e. , iflaviridae , mesoniviridae , dicistroviridae , and non - classified insect viruses ) represented the majority of viral reads , with 55.51 % , 76.23 % and 33.66 % of total viral reads for ste0043 , ste0044 and ste0045 rna viromes , respectively .
several mammalian viruses were detected , such as picobirnaviridae - related viruses , but only in the ste0045 c. imicola male and non - engorged female virome , with a global abundance of 33.73 % of total viral reads .
animal - infecting arboviruses belonging to the reoviridae family were identified and represented 26.34 % , 0.04 % and 17.79 % of total viral reads for ste0043 , ste0044 and ste0045 rna viromes , respectively ( figure 1b ) .
finally , several reads were assigned to orthomyxoviridae ( 1.69 % and 1.84 % of total viral reads for ste0043 and ste0045 viromes , respectively ) and rhabdoviridae ( 0.96 % and 1.86 % of total viral reads for ste0043 and ste0044 viromes , respectively ) but they presented a relatively low identity of 57 % - 62 % in the rna polymerase after blastx analysis ( figure 1b ) .
few dna viruses were also identified in the rna viromes ( bacteriophages and amoeba - infecting giant viruses , representing 0.02 % , 5.24 % and 12.97 % of total viral reads for ste0043 , ste0044 and ste0045 rna viromes , respectively ) , possibly due to residual contamination of the rna fraction by viral dna ( figure 1b ) .
electron microscopy images of the ste0043 culicoides sp. purified viral fraction showed the presence of virus - like particles ( vlps ) with various diameters , morphologies , and contrasts ( figure 2 ) .
some vlps presented a round structure with a distinct envelope , while others appeared with more contrast .
the diameters of the particles ranged from 100 nm to 600 nm ( figure 2 ) .
principal component analysis ( pca ) was used to compare viral communities of biting midges with other haematophagous and non - haematophagous arthropod rna viromes available in public databases ( figure 3 , table s1 ) .
rna viromes of biting midges clustered together , but the ste0043 culicoides sp. virome was more distant than the ste0044 c. imicola engorged female and ste0045 c. imicola male and non - engorged female viromes .
in addition , biting midge viromes were closer to field and artificially - infected mosquito metagenomes than to whitefly and butterfly viromes ( figure 3 ) .
3.2 .
orbiviruses were abundant in senegalese biting midges within the viral reads , reoviridae - related sequences represented 26.34 % , 0.04 % and 17.79 % in ste0043 , ste0044 and ste0045 rna viromes , respectively ; with the presence of bluetongue - related sequences in ste0043 ( n = 3656 reads ) and ste0045 ( n = 678 reads ) viromes while epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus ( ehdv ) was detected in ste0043 ( n = 5454 reads ) and ste0044 ( n = 5 reads ) viromes .
african horse sickness virus ( ahsv ) was only detected in the ste0043 culicoides sp. rna virome ( n = 1647 reads ) .
various segments of these 10 - segmented double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) orbiviruses were detected in the metagenomes .
for example ehdv - related sequences matched with vp4 protein of segment 4 in the ste0044 c. imicola engorged female virome .
in the ste0045 sample , all reads matched with segment 8 ( ns2 protein ) of the bluetongue virus ( btv ) .
within the ste0043 culicoides sp. virome , sequences related to segments 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 7 - 8 and 9 of ahsv were present , while ns1 ( segment 5 ) and ns3 ( segment 10 ) were not detected .
segments 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 8 and 9 of btv and segments 1 - 3 - 4 - 6 and 8 of ehdv were detected , with a global coverage of the genome estimated after mapping at 37.27 % , 34.58 % and 33.16 % for ahsv , btv and ehdv , respectively , in the ste0043 metagenome ( data not shown ) .
3.3 .
novel thogotovirus species within the virome of the ste0043 culicoides sp. and ste0045 c. imicola male and non - engorged female samples , large contigs of 1903 nt and 1217 nt , respectively , matched with the viral rna polymerase pb1 segment of viruses belonging to the genus thogotovirus ( family orthomyxoviridae ) , with a nucleotide identity of 61.26 % and 57.61 % , respectively .
phylogenetic analyses enabled the identification of a clade formed by the identified thogotovirus - like orthomyxovirus , tentatively named " dielmo orthomyxovirus " ( dov ) , with a high bootstrap value of 99.2 and a high posterior probability of 1 ( figure 4a ) .
the clade formed by dov , placed at the root of the group formed by viruses belonging to the thogotovirus genus , is supported by high bootstrap value and posterior probability , suggesting that dov could constitute either a novel species within the thogotovirus genus or a novel genus within the orthomyxoviridae family ( figure 4a ) .
however , analyses of genetic distances between dov and other orthomyxoviruses supported the classification of dov among the thogotovirus genus rather than a new genus since it presented similar distances with other thogotoviruses and distances in the same range as those observed between other thogotoviruses and influenzavirus genus ( figure 4b ) .
3.4 .
novel rhabdoviridae genus within the virome of the ste0043 culicoides sp. and ste0044 c. imicola engorged female samples , large contigs of 1397 nt and 1572 nt , respectively , matched with the viral rna polymerase of north creek virus ( ncv ) , a novel rhabdovirus detected in australian mosquito metagenomes [ 26 ] .
the new senegalese rhabdovirus , tentatively named " dielmo rhabdovirus " ( drv ) , was distant from north creek virus , with only 62.61 % and 61.06 % of nucleotide homologies , respectively .
nucleotide and amino - acid sequences of ste0043 and ste0044 dielmo rhabdovirus were 100 % identical , while they presented a genetic distance from australian mosquito north creek virus of 0.352 and 0.377 in nucleotide and amino - acid sequences , respectively .
in order to identify whether drv could either constitute a novel species or a novel genus within the rhabdoviridae family , we selected genbank sequences according to the walker et al. dataset [ 27 ] in order to clearly identify recognised or putative rhabdoviridae genera ( figure 5 ) .
phylogenetic analysis identified a clade ( sub - clade i ) formed by biting midge drv and australian mosquito ncv , with a high bootstrap value of 99 and a high posterior probability of 1 .
beaumont virus , another rhabdovirus identified in australian mosquito metagenomes [ 26 ] and culex tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus ( ctrv ) , identified in japanese mosquitoes [ 28 ] formed a sub - clade ii at the root of sub - clade i ( figure 5 , figure s2 ) .
this group , consisting of the two sub - clades , could constitute a novel genus within the rhabdoviridae family ( figure 5 , figure s2 ) .
this putative genus was tentatively named dielmovirus genus .
dielmoviruses belong to the dimarhabdovirus supergroup ( dipteran - mammal rhabdoviruses ) ( figure s2 ) .
the genetic distances of dielmovirus genus compared to other rhabdoviridae genera , as defined by walker et al .
[ 27 ] , are presented in figure 6 .
the mean genetic distance between viruses within the dielmovirus genus is higher than that observed within each recognised or putative genus ( figure 6a ) , with the exception of sigmaviruses , supporting the distinction of two sub - clades within the dielmovirus genus : one formed by ncv and drv , and the other composed of beaumont and ctr viruses .
in addition , the putative dielmovirus genus presented a distribution of distances with other genera in the same range than the global distribution of distances observed between other genera ( figure 6b ) .
viruses belonging to the dielmovirus genus diverge by approximately 15 % - 26 % in the amino - acid sequence of the rna - dependant rna polymerase from other rhabdoviridae genera , which is globally observed for all other genera with the exception of the lyssavirus , almendravirus , bahiavirus and sawgravirus genera , which seemed to present a greater genetic distance ( figure 6b ) .
interestingly , these four recognised and putative genera did not belong to the dimarhabdovirus supergroup ( figure 6b , figure s2 ) .
the sigmavirus genus presented the least distance with dielmovirus , and bahiavirus presented the greatest distance , which is consistent with phylogenetic observations .
3.5 .
detection of jingmen tick virus - related sequences within the virome of the ste0043 culicoides sp. sample , one contig of 609 nt matched with the ns5 segment of jingmen tick virus ( jtv ) , a novel chimerical virus isolated in chinese ticks and composed of four segments : two originating from a flavivirus ( ns3 and ns5 - like segments ) and two with high similarities with toxocara canis nematode cdna library [ 29 ] .
the senegalese biting midge jingmen tick - like virus ( jtv - like virus ) presented a low nucleotide identity of 57.95 % with the jtv ns5 segment .
phylogenetic analysis of several representative flaviviruses , jtv and mogiana tick virus ( mtv , another virus isolated in ticks which has similarities with flaviviruses [ 30 ]) performed in the ns5 gene revealed that the senegalese jtv - like virus was located at the root of a clade formed by these new flavi - like viruses with a high bootstrap value of 97 and a high posterior probability of 1 .
this clade does not belong to the flavivirus genus ( posterior probability of 1 for the node defining this clade apart from the flavivirus genus clade ) , but belongs to the flaviviridae family ( figure 7 ) .
in addition , by re - analysing contigs with low identities and coverage that were previously discarded , we detected one contig which matched the jtv ns3 segment with a homology percentage of 41.3 % in nucleotide and an e - value of 10 - 9 , and a contig which matched toxocara canis ant - 5 with an e - value of 10 - 59 and homology of 34.18 % .
3.6 .
presence of endogenous viral elements ?
to verify the presence of endogenous viral elements ( eve ) within the major detected arboviruses , we screened for the presence of possible integration sites within the viral contigs .
among the 3 ' portion of the jtv - like viral contig , only 23 nt did not match with a viral sequence but matched with ovis canadensis chromosome 25 .
we were not able to detect similar sequences in other viral contigs .
in addition , and due to reports of a rhabdoviral eve in mosquitoes [ 31 ] , we performed a bayesian inference phylogenetic analysis of the dielmovirus rhabdovirus genus compared to other rhabdoviruses and rhabdoviridae - related eves , which confirmed that dielmoviruses did not correspond to the previously identified a. aegyti rna - dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) - related eve ( figure s3 ) .
finally , the presence of eves in the glycoprotein gene of orthomyxoviridae in the genome of ixodes scapularis ticks had previously been reported [ 32 ] , but not among the pb1 segment of the rdrp detected in our biting midge orthomyxovirus .
3.7 .
other viruses present in biting midges sequencing the viral communities of senegalese biting midges revealed the presence of viruses infecting a wide variety of hosts , including mammals , insects , plants and bacteria .
mammalian - infecting viruses were only detected in ste0045 c. imicola male and non - engorged female rna viromes and consisted of 33.73 % of total viral reads ( figure 1b ) .
the viral family which was most represented was picobirnaviridae ( 57.59 % of all mammalian viral reads ) .
interestingly , the picobirnaviridae - related contig matched with a feline picobirnavirus with a nucleotide identity of 53.91 % , suggesting the presence of a possible new picobirnavirus either originating from culicoides or from animals on which arthropods feed .
insect - specific viruses were also highly abundant in the viromes , representing 55.51 % , 76.23 % and 33.66 % of total viral reads in the ste0043 , ste0044 and ste0045 rna viromes , respectively ( figure 1b ) .
iflaviridae were abundant , but most insect - specific viral reads matched with novel viruses , currently not recognised by the international committee for taxonomy of viruses ( ictv ) .
indeed , sequences matching the loreto virus , negev virus and negev - like virus 174 , piura virus and nora virus were retrieved , with low nucleotide identities comprised between 50 % and 56 % , 50 % and 60 % , 63 % and 74 % , 51 % and 63 % and 67 % and 69 % , respectively .
plant - infecting viruses belonging to the partitiviridae and tymoviridae families were detected in the ste0043 and ste0044 viromes .
partitiviridae - related sequences from alphapartitivirus , betapartitivirus , gammapartitivirus genera and unclassified partitiviruses were detected in the ste0043 virome whereas only unclassified partitiviruses were identified in the ste0044 virome .
all sequences displayed low nucleotide identities ( 53 % - 75 %) suggesting the detection of potentially new viruses .
tymoviridae - related sequences , again with low nucleotide identities ( 51 % - 64 %) , were also detected in the ste0043 virome and were assigned to the maculavirus and marafivirus genera .
several reads related to bacteriophages were also detected in the ste0044 and ste0045 samples , and amoeba - infecting giant viral sequences were identified in the ste0045 virome , probably reflecting a residual contamination of dna in the rna preparations ( figure 1b ) or the carriage of mrnas within viral particles .
4. discussion we report in this study an extensive characterisation of the rna viral communities of senegalese biting midges .
analysis of the taxonomic assignment of reads revealed a high proportion of unknown sequences .
this result , in the same range as those observed in tick [ 10 ] and mosquito [ 8 ] metagenomes , again reflects the lack of data about rna viruses in the databases , and highlights the potential pool of unknown viruses yet to be discovered and which could represent future emerging viruses .
the pattern of composition of rna viral communities was highly divergent in terms of relative abundance and of the composition of viruses within the three metagenomes , although arthropods were collected at the same place during the same night in the same trap .
this suggests that these differences may result from intrinsic characteristics of the insects rather than the environment .
however , the three biting midge viromes clustered together in the principal component analysis when compared to other haematophagous and non - haematophagous arthropods , suggesting the presence of a " core " viral community shared by all biting midges , and " accessory " viral communities specific to a species , gender or haematophagous status .
indeed , ste0043 culicoides sp. was more distant than the ste0045 pool of c. imicola males and non - engorged females and the ste0044 pool of c. imicola engorged females , despite the fact that they differ only by arthropod species composition .
in addition , biting midge viromes were closer to other haematophagous arthropods than to non - haematophagous arthropods , potentially highlighting the influence of blood meal in the composition of viromes .
orbivirus - related sequences were the most represented in the viromes .
these reoviridae are livestock - restricted viruses which cause significant economic losses : ahsv causes malfunctions of the circulatory and respiratory systems leading to the death of equines , while btv and ehdv cause significant decreases in milk production and death in ruminants [ 15,33,34,35 ] .
in europe and africa , the main vector of ahsv and btv is c. imicola , while ehdv is transmitted by the c. schultzei group in africa [ 15 ] .
in senegal , several culicoides species are present : the c. imicola , c. schultzei , c. milnei , c. magnus and c. fulvithorax groups [ 36 ] , which can represent a potential epizootic risk to livestock .
in 2007 , senegal reported a significant ahsv epidemic among equines and , since then , animals have been vaccinated [ 37 ] .
btv also highly circulates among ruminants , as shown in sero - epidemiological studies [ 38 ] , although no recent epidemics have been reported .
in addition , to our knowledge , no ehd epidemic or study has been reported in senegal , but the symptoms of btv or ehdv infections are very similar , resulting in a possible wrong diagnosis of an etiology as a bluetongue - like pathology [ 15 ] .
in this study we reported the detection of sequences related to ahsv , btv and ehdv reoviridae viruses .
the ste0043 pool of culicoides sp. presented the majority of reoviridae reads , and within them , ahsv , btv and ehdv represented 15.3 % , 34.0 % and 50.7 % of total reoviridae - related sequences , respectively .
interestingly , only a few btv reads were detected in the ste0044 c. imicola engorged female and ste0045 c. imicola males and non - engorged females despite the fact that c. imicola is known to be the main vector of this virus in africa .
despite the fact that this study constitutes a snapshot of the composition of viral communities present in biting midges sampled at a given time and location and may not reflect the composition of the viral communities of senegalese culicoides through one year , this result may suggest that other midge species could be vectors of btv in senegal , as demonstrated by the high prevalence of btv in the ste0043 culicoides sp. pool .
diarra et al. completed in 2014 a one - year survey of culicoides midge populations in senegal [ 39 ] .
they showed that culicoides oxystoma , followed by c. kingi and c. imicola , were the most prevalent species of biting midges , and they could constitute alternative vectors of btv .
in addition , the authors showed that c. imicola presented a globally constant abundance throughout the year lower than the ones observed for c. oxystoma and c. kingi , while c. oxystoma peaked during august to november and c. kingi during may to october , suggesting that possible other midges species may play the role of vectors of btv in senegal , depending on the season .
further follow - up of circulating viruses in different midge populations throughout the year would help clarify vector ( s ) and seasonality of btv in senegal .
finally , the detection of ehdv - related reads matching nearly all of the viral segments suggests that the virus is probably circulating among the vector populations and may precede the onset of an outbreak .
thus , it highlights the importance of monitoring the emergence of epizooties by studying viral communities of haematophagous arthropods [ 3 ] .
in 2009 , peter daszak noted that only 0.2 % of the total estimated viral diversity possibly infecting humans is currently known [ 40 ]. by allowing the identification of potential new viruses , next - generation sequencing techniques allow reducing this gap .
indeed , in this study we reported the description of new viruses in biting midge rna viromes , including a novel thogotovirus .
dielmo orthomyxovirus ( dov ) was detected in the pool of culicoides sp. and the pool of c. imicola males and non - engorged females .
phylogenetic analyses and calculation of genetic distance resulted in the identification of a new thogotovirus species , distinct from other known thogotoviruses .
thogotoviruses are single - stranded rna ( ssrna ) negative - strand segmented viruses belonging to the orthomyxoviridae family .
all isolated from hard ticks [ 41 ] ( with the exception of the batken virus , which was also isolated from mosquitoes [ 42 ]) , thogotoviruses are able to infect a wide variety of vertebrate hosts , including birds , rodents , livestock and humans [ 43,44,45,46,47,48,49 ] .
in humans , these viruses cause fever and , in some cases , neurological symptoms such as meningitis or encephalitis [ 50,51 ] .
recently , a novel thogotovirus , tentatively named " bourbon virus " was responsible for the death of an individual who had previously been bitten by a tick , due to a decrease in blood platelets and white cells but with no neurological symptoms [ 52 ] .
the status of the newly described dielmo orthomyxovirus is currently unknown , but the successful isolation of dov should permit to ( i ) determine its phylogenetic relationships with other thogotoviruses by sequencing its genome ; ( ii ) review experiences of the vector competence of culicoides midges to transmit the virus and allow its possible classification as an " arbovirus " ; and ( iii ) develop an animal model of infection to determine its pathogenicity .
novel rhabdoviridae - related viral sequences were also detected .
these sequences clustered together in a monophyletic group with north creek virus , a virus recently discovered in culex sitiens mosquitoes in australia [ 26 ] .
we propose that this sub - clade , in addition to another sub - clade formed by the beaumont virus [ 26 ] and culex tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus [ 28 ] , form a new genus within the rhabdoviridae family , tentatively named dielmovirus .
dielmoviruses cluster with the sigmavirus genus , within which viruses were only isolated from drosophila flies .
many rhabdoviruses were previously isolated from biting midges [ 27 ] : for example , fukuoka virus ( a cattle virus ) , vesicular stomatitis new jersey virus ( a cattle virus ) , wongabel virus ( a seabird virus ) , ngaingan virus ( a cattle virus ) , curionopolis virus ( a primate virus ) and tibrogargan virus ( a cattle virus ) .
nearly all of them belong to the " arbovirus " group , with the exception of the itacaiunas virus , which is restricted to midges and which form a distinct clade .
dielmoviruses , such as the sigmaviruses , appear to be restricted to haematophagous ( mosquitoes , biting midges ) and non - haematophagous ( flies ) diptera , and phylogenetic analyses revealed that insect - specific rhabdoviruses form distinct monophyletic groups , suggesting that stringent host specificity occurs for these viruses ( figure 5 , [ 27 ]) .
in contrast , arbo - rhabdoviruses , possibly due to significant host switching between vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors , appear to be more diverse .
indeed , higher genetic distances among recognised or putative genera were observed for sigmavirus and dielmovirus , reinforcing the observation that strong host specificity occurs among insect - specific rhabdoviruses .
vasilakis and tesh recently noted that insect - specific rhabdoviruses , as well as bunyaviruses and flaviviruses , are ancient and probably evolved and diversified in parallel with their insect hosts [ 53 ] , via vertical transmission or integration within the host genome .
it is well - known that arthropod genomes , as well as vertebrate animals , contain integrated fragments or entire genomes of viral rna [ 31,32,54,55,56,57,58 ] .
these regions , called eve [ 32 ] , can be functional in the genomes of several hosts [ 58,59,60 ] and often derive from ancient viral infections for which the integration was vertically transmitted and evolve in parallel with their eukaryotic host .
in our study , we demonstrated that the newly described thogotovirus species and rhabdoviridae genera did not correspond to previously reported related eves [ 31,32 ] , suggesting that these viruses could constitute novel viral species and genus .
to conclude , this study reports the first description of viral communities of haematophagous arthropods which have an impact on human and veterinary medicine : the culicoides .
we detected the presence of several novel viruses , including a novel thogotovirus species and a novel rhabdoviridae genus , which may constitute potential risks for human and animal health .
this study thus highlights the importance of characterising the viral communities of haematophagous arthropods as a first step in the evaluation of the emergence of epizooties and / or zoonoses using next - generation sequencing techniques .

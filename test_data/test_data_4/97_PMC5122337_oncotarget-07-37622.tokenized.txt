trpv4 ion channel mediates vascular mechanosensitivity and vasodilation .
here , we sought to explore whether non - mechanical activation of trpv4 could limit vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis .
we found that gsk1016790a , a potent and specific small - molecule agonist of trpv4 , induces the phosphorylation and activation of enos partially through the ampk pathway .
moreover , gsk1016790a inhibited tnf - alpha - induced monocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells .
mice given gsk1016790a showed increased phosphorylation of enos and ampk in the aorta and decreased leukocyte adhesion to tnf - alpha - inflamed endothelium .
importantly , oral administration of gsk1016790a reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in apoe deficient mice fed a western - type diet .
together , the present study suggests that pharmacological activation of trpv4 may serve as a potential therapeutic approach to treat atherosclerosis .
ampk atherosclerosis gsk1016790a shear stress trpv4 introduction the vascular endothelium lining inner surface of blood vessels regulates vasodilation , which is compromised in the pathological states of many cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis , hypertension , and stroke [ 1 ] .
atheroprotective laminar flow induces endothelium - dependent vascular relaxation partially through the release of the endothelium - derived nitric oxide ( no ) [ 2 , 3 ] .
recent studies have indicated that laminar flow promotes endothelial no synthase ( enos ) activation followed by no production through multiple mechanisms [ 4 - 6 ] .
although atherosclerosis can be treated by lipid - lowering statins , this protection remains incomplete and cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [ 7 ] .
therefore , laminar flow - mimetic compounds are , thus , of considerable interest for their potential therapeutic benefit in treating cardiovascular diseases .
recently , a growing body of evidence has indicated that activation of the transient receptor potential ion channel vanilloid subtype 4 ( trpv4 ) plays an essential role in flow - mediated vasodilation in animal vascular beds and human coronary arterioles [ 8 , 9 ] .
previous studies have demonstrated that trpv4 is a thermo - [ 10 , 11 ] , osmo - [ 12 ] , and mechano - sensitive [ 13 , 14 ] ion channel , which can also be activated by pharmacological agonists .
gsk1016790a is a recently discovered novel chemical entity that potently and selectively activates trpv4 channel in a variety of recombinant and cellular assays [ 15 , 16 ] .
over the past several years , gsk1016790a has been extensively used to study the pathophysiological role of trpv4 in flow - mediated no production and vascular function [ 14 , 17 ] .
more recently , it has been demonstrated that laminar flow - and trpv4 agonist - induced vasodilation was impaired in aged rat mesenteric arteries , which was restored by lentivirus - mediated trpv4 overexpression [ 18 ] .
laminar flow also sensitizes the response of trpv4 to gsk1016790a by promoting the trafficking of trpv4 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane [ 19 ] .
however , it remains unknown whether pharmacological activation of trpv4 by gsk1016790a can elicits laminar flow signaling events and prevents the development of atherosclerosis .
results gsk1016790a stimulates enos activation in human endothelial cells it is well established that laminar flow promotes no production via enos phosphorylation ( ser1177 ) [ 20 , 21 ] .
to determine whether gsk1016790a can mimic flow to stimulate enos phosphorylation in cultured ecs , human umbilical vein ecs ( huvecs ) were treated with gsk1016790a for up to 60 min .
as shown in figure 1a - 1d , gsk1016790a significantly triggered the phosphorylation of enos , akt and ampkalpha , in a time - dependent and dose - dependent manner .
as shown in figure s1 , we found that trpv4 gene was specifically expressed in human endothelial cells but not monocytes and differentiated macrophages .
we next determined whether gsk1016790a activates enos phosphorylation in human coronary artery ec ( hcaecs ) .
gsk1016790a also significantly induced enos phosphorylation , as well as the phosphorylation of akt and ampk in hcaecs ( figure 1e ) .
because enos can be phosphorylated at thr495 that inhibits enos activity [ 22 , 23 ] , we also assessed the effect of gsk1016790a on enos phosphorylation at thr495 .
we observed that enos was constitutively phosphorylated at thr495 in huvecs , and was rapidly dephosphorylated after gsk1016790a stimulation ( figure s2 ) .

- d. , time course ( a - b ) and dose - dependency ( c - d ) of gsk1016790a ( gsk101 ) stimulation in huvecs .
huvecs were treated with 10 nm gsk101 for indicated times or with indicated concentration of gsk101 for 15 min , then phosphorylation of enos , akt , and ampk were analyzed by western blotting .
data were expressed as means +/ - sem .
e. , hcaecs were treated with vehicle or 10 nm gsk101 for 15 min , then phosphorylation of enos , akt , and ampk were analyzed by western blotting .
gsk1016790a stimulates calcium - and trpv4 - dependent enos activation previous studies have shown that trpv4 is critical for flow - dependent calcium entry and vasodilation [ 14 , 24 ] .
we next asked whether depletion of intracellular and extracellular calcium ( by bapta / egta ) or inhibition of calcium influx ( by ruthenium red , rur , a pan - trpv4 antagonist ) could inhibit gsk1016790a - mediated enos phosphorylation .
we found that both bapta / egta and rur restored enos - ser1177 phosphorylation close to basal level ( figure 2a - 2b ) .
laminar flow did not alter trpv4 mrna , or protein expression ( figure s3 ) .
however , depletion of trpv4 by sirna inhibited laminar flow - induced enos phosphorylation ( figure s4 ) .
in addition , pharmacological inhibition of trpv4 activity by gsk2193874 [ 25 ] or transfection of huvecs with human trpv4 sirna diminished gsk1016790a - induced enos phosphorylation at ser1177 ( figure 2c - 2d ) .
figure 2 gsk1016790a - mediated signaling is calcium - and trpv4 - dependent a. huvecs were pretreated with vehicle ( 0.1 % dmso ) , or calcium chelator bapta ( 3 mum ) plus egta ( 500 mum ) for 30 min , and then exposed to gsk1016790a ( gsk101 , 10 nm ) for 15 min. b. huvecs were pretreated with vehicle ( h2o ) , or non - selective trpv4 inhibitor ruthenium red ( rur ; 5 mum ) for 30 min , and then exposed to gsk101 ( 10 nm ) for 15 min. c. huvecs were pretreated with vehicle ( 0.1 % dmso ) , or trpv4 specific antagonist gsk2193874 ( gsk874 , 100 nm ) for 30 min , and then exposed to gsk101 ( 10 nm ) for 15 min. d. huvecs were transfected with 25 nm non - target control sirna ( sinc ) or sirna against trpv4 ( sitrpv4 ) for 48 h and then exposed to gsk101 ( 10 nm ) for 15 min .
cell lysates were analyzed for western blots using antibodies indicated .
gsk1016790a promotes enos activation partially through the camkk / ampk pathway we next determined whether gsk1016790a activates ampk activity , which is evidenced by phosphorylation of acetyl - coa carboxylase ( acc ) , a substrate of ampk [ 26 ] .
we observed significant ampk phosphorylation at thr172 , with attendant acc phosphorylation at ser79 after gsk1016790a stimulation ( figure s5 ) .
calcium / calmodulin - dependent kinase kinase ( camkk ) is a calcium - sensitive ampk upstream signaling molecule [ 27 , 28 ] .
thus we tested the effect of the selective camkk inhibitor sto - 609 on gsk1016790a - elicited ampk and enos phosphorylation .
we found that sto - 609 almost abolished gsk1016790a - mediated ampk and enos phosphorylation ( figure 3a ) .
similarly , we found that the ampk inhibitor compound c partially but significantly attenuated gsk1016790a - induced enos phosphorylation ( figure 3b ) .
moreover , sto - 609 and compound c reduced gsk1016790a - mediated vasorelaxation in aortic vessels ( figure 3c ) .
figure 3 gsk1016790a activates enos partially through the camkk / ampk pathway a. huvecs were pretreated with vehicle ( 0.1 % dmso ) , or the cammk inhibitor sto - 609 ( 1 mum ) for 30 min , and then exposed to gsk1016790a ( gsk101 , 10 nm ) for 15 min. b. huvecs were pretreated with vehicle ( 0.1 % dmso ) , or the ampk inhibitor compound c ( 3 mum ) for 30 min , and then exposed to gsk101 ( 10 nm ) for 15 min. c. aortas from c57bl / 6j mice were pretreated with vehicle ( 0.1 % dmso ) , or sto - 609 ( 1 mum ) , or compound c ( 3 mum ) for 30 min , then gsk101 ( 10 nm ) - induced vasorelaxation of phenylephrine ( pe , 1 mum ) - precontracted aorta were determined .

### p < 0.001 vs. gsk101 group .
we next investigated the potential role of akt in gsk1016790a - induced enos activation .
we observed that ly294002 failed to block gsk1016790a - mediated enos phosphorylation at ser1177 ( figure s6 ) .
previous studies suggest that laminar flow can also phosphorylate enos at ser1177 via the pka - dependent pathway [ 29 ] .
our results showed that h - 89 , a selective inhibitor of pka [ 29 ] , failed to significantly inhibit gsk1016790a - dependent enos - ser1177 phosphorylation , suggesting that pka may not be involved in gsk1016790a - induced enos - ser1177 phosphorylation ( figure s7 ) .
collectively , our results suggest that gsk1016790a promotes enos activation partially through the camkk / ampk - dependent pathway .
gsk1016790a acutely activates enos and ampk phosphorylation in mouse aorta to further validate and extend our in vitro results to more physiological settings , we tested whether treating normal c57bl / 6j mice with gsk1016790a activates ampk and enos phosphorylation in the mouse aorta .
to this end , we injected ( by i.p . )
12 - week - old male mice with either gsk1016790a ( 50 mug / kg body weight ) or vehicle .
western blot analysis revealed that a single i.p. injection of gsk1016790a resulted in increased phosphorylation of enos , ampk and acc in the aorta after 30 min ( figure 4a and 4b ) .
en face immunofluorescent staining also revealed that gsk1016790a significantly promoted phosphorylation of enos at ser1177 and ampk at thr172 in aortic endothelium ( figure 4c and 4d ) .
taken together , these results indicate that gsk1016790a acutely activates enos and ampk in the intact aorta , highlighting the physiological significance of gsk1016790a for its potential to improve vascular function .
figure 4 gsk1016790a treatment induces enos and ampk phosphorylation in mouse aorta a .
- b. three - month old male c57bl / 6j mice were injected ( i.p. ) with gsk1016790a ( gsk101 , 50 mug / kg body weight ) or vehicle ( n = 17 for detecting p - enos ser1177 ; n = 6 for detecting p - ampk and p - acc ) .
thirty minutes after the treatment , mice were sacrificed and aortic tissues were harvested .

gsk1016790a inhibits monocyte - endothelial cell adhesion in vitro and in vivo enos - derived no production prevents monocyte adhesion to ecs [ 30 ] .
to determine whether enos activity enhancement by gsk1016790a improves ec function , the effect of gsk1016790a on tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf - alpha ) - induced monocyte adhesion to ecs was evaluated .
we observed that tnf - alpha - induced monocyte adhesion was significantly reversed by the treatment of gsk1016790a ( figure 5a and 5b ) .
the preventive effect of gsk1016790a against tnf - alpha - induced monocyte adhesion was due to decreased pro - inflammatory intracellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( icam1 ) and vascular cellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( vcam1 ) mrna and protein expression , but not related to a change in expression of anti - inflammatory molecules enos and kruppel - like factor 2 ( klf2 ) , ( figure 5c and 5d ) .
moreover , the inhibitory effect of gsk1016790a on monocyte adhesion was partially inhibited by l - name and compound c ( figure 5e and 5f ) , suggesting the involvement of the ampk / enos pathway .
figure 5 gsk1016790a attenuates monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo a. huvecs were pretreated with vehicle ( dmso ) , or gsk1016790a ( gsk101 , 1 nm and 10 nm ) for 2 h , and then exposed to tnf - alpha ( 10 ng / ml ) or vehicle ( pbs ) for an additional 6 h. then , u937 monocytes was added for 30 min .
images were taken from representative optical fields showing endothelial cells ( cobblestone shape ) and adhering u937 monocytes ( small , round cells ) in the co - culture. b. summary data for adherent monocytes described in a. c. and d. huvecs were treated as described in a , then mrna and protein expression of icam1 and vcam1 were determined by qpcr and western blotting , respectively .

## p < 0.01 vs. tnf - alpha + gsk101 group. g. male c57bl / 6 mice were pretreated with vehicle or gsk1016790a ( 10 mg / kg / d , by oral gavage ) for 3 days , followed by vehicle or tnf - alpha injection ( i.p. ) for 4 h , intravital microscopy analysis was then performed to evaluate leukocyte adhesion to endothelium in the mesenteric microcirculation .
representative still images were shown for mice treated with vehicle ( pbs ) , gsk101 , tnf - alpha , or tnf - alpha plus gsk101 .
summary data are provided in h. values are mean +/ - sem ; n = 6 - 10 ; *** p < 0.001 versus pbs group , ### p < 0.001 versus tnf - alpha group .
to evaluate whether the anti - inflammatory effect of gsk1016790a in ecs translates to whole vessel , intravital microscopy analysis was performed to quantify leukocyte - ecs adhesion in mouse mesenteric microcirculation .
compared with vehicle control , tnf - alpha treatment significantly reduced leukocyte rolling velocity , and this effect was reversed by gsk1016790a pre - treatment ( figure 5g and 5h ) .
notably , gsk1016790a administration alone had no impact on leukocyte rolling velocity in vehicle - treated mice .
these findings indicate that gsk1016790a inhibits inflammatory responses in the vasculature in vivo , by attenuating leukocyte adhesion to endothelium .
gsk1016790a attenuates the development of atherosclerosis in apoe - / - mice endothelial dysfunction and leukocyte adhesion to inflamed endothelium are the hallmarks of early phase of atherosclerosis [ 30 ] .
thus , we explored the potential therapeutic efficacy of gsk1016790a in apoe - / - mice .
analyses of lipid profiles reveal that gsk1016790a did not alter total cholesterol ( 1406.0 +/ - 120.9 mg / dl vs 1361.0 +/ - 152.5 mg / dl , n = 5 ) or total triglyceride levels ( 64.0 +/ - 9.8 mg / dl vs 76.8 +/ - 14.5 mg / dl , n = 4 - 5 ) .
gross observation of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch showed that lesions were significantly reduced in gsk1016790a - treated mice ( figure 6a ) .
in addition , the development of atherosclerotic plaques in aortic sinus was dramatically decreased in the mice treated with gsk101016790a ( figure 6b - 6c ) .
an en face preparation along the whole aorta also showed a stark contrast between the vehicle and gsk1016790a treated mice with regard to the percentage of oil red o - positive atherosclerotic plaques to total luminal surface area ( figure 6d - 6e ) .
infiltrated monocytes differentiate to macrophages which uptake modified ldl to become foam cells , and thus causing atherosclerosis .
we also observed decreased macrophage content in the aortic sinus of gsk1016790a - treated mice ( figure 6f - 6g ) .
figure 6 gsk1016790a attenuates the development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoe - / - mice a. representative images of atherosclerotic lesion formation in aortic arch of vehicle and gsk1016790a ( gsk101 ) - treated apoe - / - mice. b. frozen sections from the aortic sinus of apoe - / - mice treated with vehicle or gsk101 for 4 weeks were stained with oil red o. the area of the oil red o - positive atherosclerotic lesions was quantified in c. each symbol in the scatter plots represents the lesion area of one individual mouse .

l , lumen ; a , atheroma ; m , media. g. quantification of cd68 positive staining of macrophages in panel f. discussion trpv4 is an important mechanosensing ion channel highly expressed in ecs that senses mechanical cues such as blood flow .
emerging evidence suggests that trpv4 regulates vascular tone via no generation [ 31 ] .
endothelial dysfunction , characterized by a decrease of no bioavailability , is a hallmark of atherosclerosis [ 1 ] .
therefore , pharmacological activation of trpv4 channel would confer atheroprotection .
in the present study , we demonstrate that : 1 ) trpv4 activation by gsk1016790a induces enos ser1177 phosphorylation and activation in vascular ecs partially by activating the camkk / ampk pathway ; 2 ) gsk1016790a - elicted enos activation inhibits monocyte adhesion to ecs in vitro and leukocytes rolling in vivo ; and 3 ) gsk1016790a attenuates the development of atherosclerosis in apoe - / - mice fed a western diet .
our findings suggest that gsk1016790a suppresses vascular inflammation and has therapeutic potential for treating atherosclerosis .
the activation of enos is regulated by the coordinated phosphorylation of enos at multiple sites [ 32 ] .
specifically , phosphorylation of enos at ser615 , ser633 , and ser1177 and dephosphorylation at thr495 activates the enzyme [ 32 ] .
in our study , we mainly focused on gsk1016790a - mediated enos phosphorylation at ser1177 , a major enos phosphorylation site contributed to enos activation [ 33 , 34 ] .
because pkcalpha mediates acetylcholine - induced receptor - mediated trpv4 activation in ecs [ 35 ] and pkcalpha stimulates enos phosphorylation on t495 [ 22 , 36 ] , we tested whether gsk1016790a decreases enos phosphorylation at thr495 to further enhance enos activation .
our data suggest that gsk1016790a decreases enos phosphorylation at thr495 .
our results suggest that the combined effects of increased phosphorylation of enos at ser1177 and dephosphorylation at thr495 cooperatively enhance enos activation by gsk1016790a .
one direction of our future studies could be to delineate the signaling mechanisms whereby gsk1016790a induces enos dephosphorylation at thr495 , such as the potential involvement of protein phosphatase 1 [ 22 ] .
in addition , it remains to be investigated whether gsk1016790a affects other enos phosphorylation sites such as ser615 and ser633 .
multiple protein kinases are implicated in enos ser1177 phosphorylation and subsequent activation , including akt , ampk , ca2 +/ calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) , and pka in a context - dependent manner [ 27 , 32 , 37 - 39 ] .
for example , shear stress promotes enos phosphorylation at s1177 via the akt [ 21 , 33 ] , ampk [ 20 ] and pka [ 29 ] dependent pathways and far infrared radiation increase enos phosphorylation at ser1177 via a camkii - dependent manner [ 39 ] .
we observed that the camkk inhibitor sto - 609 abolished the effect of gsk1016790a on ampk and enos phosphorylation , which suggests that camkk is the upstream kinase of ampk and responsible for enos activation .
furthermore , the ampk inhibitor compound c partially inhibited gsk1016790a - mediated enos phosphorylation , suggesting that ampk plays a partial role in gsk1016790a - stimulated enos phosphorylation .
using the pka inhibitor h - 89 , we also excluded the possible involvement of a pka [ 40 ] in gsk1016790a - mediated enos phosphorylation at ser1177 .
this is different from trpv1 channel activation by capsaicin , which activates pka - dependent enos phosphorylation and vasorelaxation in spontaneously hypertensive rats [ 41 ] .
our results do not completely rule out the possibility that other kinases such as akt [ 33 , 34 , 42 , 43 ] and camkii [ 23 , 39 ] may also play a role in gsk1016790a - mediated enos phosphorylation .
our data showed that pharmacological inhibition of pi3k / akt did not significantly affect gsk1016790a - induced enos phosphorylation at s1177 at early time points .
however , there are some literatures showing akt functions downstream of ampk [ 44 , 45 ] , so it is possible that akt could be involved in the sustained activation of enos at s1177 .
also , it remains unknown whether akt is involved in gsk1016790a - induced enos phosphorylation at other activation sites , such as s615 .
likewise , camkii may also play a role in gsk1016790a - mediated enos phosphorylation , a notion supported by the finding that pan - trpv inhibition blocks far infrared radiation - induced camkii - dependent enos phosphorylation at ser1177 [ 39 ] .
the direct involvement of both kinases warrants further studies in vitro and in vivo .
it remains unknown regarding the precise role of trpv4 in mouse and human atherosclerosis and whether endothelial function and atherosclerosis development will be exaggerated in trpv4 - / - ; apoe - / - mice , or in apoe - / - mice treated with the trpv4 inhibitor gsk2193874 .
since atherosclerosis involves multiple cell types , thus systemic administration of gsk1016790a may potentially affect non - endothelial cells .
in addition , we also recognize that additional long - term studies are needed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties and potential side effects ( such as toxicity and vascular permeability ) of gsk1016790a in animal model of atherosclerosis .
also , other potential beneficial downstream pathways ( in addition to the activation of akt , ampk , and enos ) activated by gsk1016790a remain to be investigated in future studies in summary , the present study demonstrates that gsk1016790a , a specific and potent small - molecule activator of mechanosensitive ion channel trpv4 , induces enos phosphorylation and activation , and inhibits leukocyte adhesion to endothelium and the eventual development of atherosclerosis in mice .
our findings implicate that pharmacological activation of trpv4 may serve as an effective and complementary strategy to the management of cardiovascular diseases .

during the cell cycle , mitochondria undergo regulated changes in morphology .
two particularly interesting events are first , mitochondrial hyperfusion during the g1 - s transition and second , fragmentation during entry into mitosis .
the mitochondria remain fragmented between late g2 - and mitotic exit .
this mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation constitutes a checkpoint in some cell types , of which little is known .
we bypass the ' mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation ' checkpoint by inducing fragmented mitochondrial morphology and then measure the effect on cell cycle progression .
using drosophila larval hemocytes , drosophila s2r + cell and cells in the pouch region of wing imaginal disc of drosophila larvae we show that inhibiting mitochondrial fusion , thereby increasing fragmentation , causes cellular hyperproliferation and an increase in mitotic index .
however , mitochondrial fragmentation due to over - expression of the mitochondrial fission machinery does not cause these changes .
our experiments suggest that the inhibition of mitochondrial fusion increases superoxide radical content and leads to the upregulation of cyclin b that culminates in the observed changes in the cell cycle .
we provide evidence for the importance of mitochondrial superoxide in this process .
our results provide an insight into the need for mitofusin - degradation during mitosis and also help in understanding the mechanism by which mitofusins may function as tumor suppressors .

introduction mitochondrial morphology changes in concert with the cell cycle , and steady - state morphology is maintained by fission and fusion [ 1 ] .
mitochondria are tubular in g1 - , consisting of filamentous structures disconnected from each other [ 2 ] .
at the g1 - s transition , all the isolated elements of the mitochondrial reticulum form a hyperfused giant network that is electrically connected [ 3 ] .
the formation of this mitochondrial network correlates with a transient increase in the amount of cyclin e , which in turn advances the cell cycle from g1 - into s - phase .
in late s - phase , the hyperfused mitochondrial network fragments into tubules [ 2,3 ] .
in late g2 - , the mitochondria are seen as thick filaments .
at the g2 / m transition , prior to nuclear envelope breakdown , the mitochondria undergo fission into small fragments [ 2,3 ] .
this mitotic fragmentation is mediated by specific , post - translational modification of key proteins involved in mitochondrial fission as well as mitochondrial fusion .
dynamin - related protein drp1 is a gtpase that executes mitochondrial fission [ 4 ] .
at the g2 / m transition , a sumo protease senp5 translocates from the nucleoli to the mitochondria where it desumoylates drp1 promoting the formation of pro - fission oligomers [ 5 ] .
the fission activity of drp1 is increased by phosphorylation of ser - 585 by the mitotic cyclin complex containing cyclin b and cdk1 [ 2 ] .
along with an increase in fission , mitochondrial fusion is inhibited .
various proteins have been isolated that mediate fusion of the mitochondrial outer membrane and separately of the mitochondrial inner membrane .
among these , mitofusin ( mfn ) proteins are of particular interest because they contain a gtpase domain , a coiled - coil domain for tethering their counter - parts on opposing mitochondria as well as a bi - partite transmembrane domain anchoring them to the mitochondrial outer membrane [ 6 ] .
mammalian cells possess two mitofusins , mfn1 and mfn2 , of which mfn1 is specific to the mitochondria .
march5 is an e3 ubiquitin ligase .
during g2 / m march5 - mediated ubiquitylation of mfn1 increases , consequently mfn1 levels are reduced [ 7 ] .
increase in pro - fission activity of drp1 , and the loss of the pro - fusion protein mfn1 , result in mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation .
drp1 - mediated fragmentation of the mitochondrial network is an essential step in apoptosis that is conserved across phyla [ 8 ] .
however , the significance of fragmented mitochondrial morphology during mitosis is not completely understood .
inhibition of mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation has cell - type specific phenotypes [ 3,9,10 ] , suggesting that at least in some cells mitotic mitochondrial fragmentation could constitute a cell - cycle checkpoint .
the operational details of this proposed checkpoint are obscure .
lack of mitochondrial fission causes replicative stress activating the g2 / m checkpoint by atm kinase [ 9 ] or caspase - 8 dependent apoptosis at the g2 / m checkpoint [ 10 ] .
a similar compartment - based g2 / m checkpoint is the golgi mitotic checkpoint that has been characterized to a greater extent .
golgi ribbon severing is brought about by the activity of bars [ 11 ] and grasp65 [ 12 ] .
blocking the activity of bars ( using dominant - negative or antibody ) or of grasp65 ( sirna ) leads to reduced recruitment and impaired activation of aurora - a at the centrosome [ 13 ] , which in turn prevents activation of cyclin b - cdk1 and hence functions as a checkpoint .
this g2 / m checkpoint is bypassed by the over - expression of aurora - a [ 13 ] .
using a similar thought - process , we have modulated the mitochondrial fission - fusion machinery to bypass the mitochondrial morphology component of the g2 / m checkpoint .
we find that mitochondrial fragmentation brought about by inhibition of fusion is important in mitosis .
prolonged inhibition of fusion , as performed in our assays by rna interference , increases the mitotic index by upregulating cyclin b in a mitochondrial superoxide - dependent manner .
we discuss the implications of this in normal cell cycle control as well as in cancer .
materials and methods drosophila stocks , chemicals and antibodies are listed ( s1 , s2 , s3 tables ) .
primer pairs with a binding site for t7 rna polymerase were used to amplify 500 - 1000 bp of gfp or marf .
double - stranded rna ( dsrna ) was synthesized using the megascript t7 kit ( ambion ) .
concentrations of dsrna were estimated by absorbance , aliquoted and stored at - 20degreesc .
drosophila strains were grown in cornmeal agar at 25degreesc .
overexpression and dsrna - mediated depletion of transgenes ( mentioned in s1 table ) was achieved in hemocytes by crossing the uas - transgene bearing virgin females to males containing the hemocyte - specific collagen gal4 [ 14 ] .
larval hemocytes were derived from the progeny of these crosses as described [ 15,16 ] and stained to visualize mitochondria [ 15 ] .
overexpression in the wing disc was accomplished by using males containing scalloped gal4 [ 17 ] as a transgene .
s2r + cells were cultured in schneider 's drosophila medium supplemented with 7.5 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum , benzylpenicillin , streptomycin and l - glutamine .
s2r + cells were treated with 1 mug dsrna in 12 - well cell culture dishes ( greiner bio - one ) at 106 / well over 5 days and plated in clean , uncoated coverslip dishes for microscopy .
for flow cytometry , cells were harvested from three 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks ( nunc # 136196 ) , which were originally seeded with 3 x 106 cells per flask .
upon adherence , 3 mug dsrna in 3 ml serum - free medium ( express five sfm ) was added for 45 min and replaced with 3 mug dsrna in 3 ml growth medium for 72 h. cells were allowed a 20 - h recovery in growth medium without dsrna and the dsrna treatment was repeated .
doubling time of cells was measured by the online tool ( roth v. 2006 http :// www.doubling - time.com / compute.php ) .
microscopy cells were plated on goldseal coverglass no .
1 , cleaned and sterilized by uv treatment .
these cells were imaged using a 100x , 1.4 na objective on nikon te2000 - u inverted microscope equipped with cascade 512b em - ccd camera ( roper scientific ) controlled by metamorph software ( molecular devices ) .
excitation and emission wavelengths were achieved by using the appropriate filters from chroma technology corp ( bellows falls , vermont , usa ) .
pixel size for acquisition of images was 90 nm. images were processed using metamorph or imagej ( wcif or fiji ) and represented using adobe photoshop .
for s2r + cells , well separated , non - blebbing , healthy looking cells with one nucleus and without large inclusions , as selected from white light transmission were imaged .
these constituted 70 - 80 % of the cell population .
mitochondrial morphology in s2r + cells was imaged by staining the cells with 20nm mitotracker deepred in growth medium for 15 minutes .
to prevent selection bias for mitochondrial morphology , all fluorescence images were captured and cells that satisfied the criteria above were quantified .
mitochondrial morphology was scored as tubular or fragmented , depending on whether most of the mitochondrial area was occupied by tubular mitochondria .
cells with almost equal proportions were categorized as intermediate .
well - separated , dome - shaped hemocytes with no visible yeast ( that can come from dissecting the drosophila larva ) were selected for imaging and quantification .
mitochondrial morphology in hemocytes was visualized by mito - gfp fluorescence [ 18 ] and categorized as described earlier [ 15 ] or by 2 nm mitotracker deepred in complete medium for 15 minutes .
for nuclear content correlation with mitochondrial morphology , hemocytes were incubated in hoechst 33342 for 15 minutes , and the mitochondria were marked by genetically encoded mitogfp .
single - exposure images were acquired in white light transmission , uv exposure ( 350 nm +/ - 25 nm excitation , 435 nm long - pass emission ) and gfp exposure ( 480 nm +/ - 20 nm exposure , 535 nm +/ - 25 nm emission ) .
the mitogfp image was used to interpret mitochondrial morphology .
dna content was calculated from the integrated intensity of the nuclear fluorescence in the hoechst image using imagej ( rasband , w.s. , imagej , u. s. national institutes of health , bethesda , maryland , usa , http :// imagej.nih.gov / ij / , 1997 - 2014 ) .
across the larval genotypes within an experiment , exposure for the hoechst ( dna content ) was constant , and hence these intensities correlated with relative dna content .
for detection of superoxide , hemocytes were stained with 2 mum dihydroethidium in growth medium for 15 min , following precautions and protocol as described [ 19 ] .
unbound probe was washed away with excess medium .
single - exposure fluorescence images were acquired as mentioned above , using excitation wavelength of 530 nm +/ - 15 nm and emission wavelength 575 nm +/ - 20 nm. the same field was then imaged using white light transmission to determine cell boundaries .
the fluorescence image was background - corrected by subtracting the intensity of non - cellular regions in the same image from each pixel using imagej .
total fluorescence intensity of each hemocyte was computed in imagej by drawing outline of the cell on the transmission image , and transposing the region to the background - subtracted image of dihydroethidium fluorescence and calculating the integrated intensity .
circulating hemocyte counts and phospho ( ser10 ) histone h3 staining of hemocytes were performed as described [ 14,20 ] .
mitotic index is defined as the number of phosphohistone h3 - positive cells per 100 cells counted. , and atleast 500 cells were counted .
immunohistochemistry of wing discs was performed as described [ 21 ] .
anti - phospho ( ser10 ) histone h3 ( millipore # 06 - 570 ) was used at a dilution of 1:500 for immunofluorescence of hemocytes and wing disc .
flow cytometry flow cytometry was performed using on a bd calibur system .
cell cycle analysis was performed with minor modifications from the protocol described for s2 cells [ 22 ] .
for analysis of cell - cycle distributions , data from 30,000 single cell events were plotted as frequency histograms and automated cell cycle analysis was performed using flowjo software ( tree star ) .
for cyclin b and phosphohistone h3 analysis , cells were fixed ( 1 % paraformaldehyde or 95 % chilled ethanol respectively ) and permeabilized ( 0.1 % tween - 20 or 0.25 % triton - x - 100 respectively ) , incubated with antibody ( anti - cyclin b , dshb # f2f4 supernatant - - 1:10 and anti - phospho ( ser10 ) histone h3 , millipore # 06 - 570 - 1:100 ) and stained with propidium iodide .
cyclin b and phosphohistone h3 were detected by secondary antibodies conjugated with alexafluor 488 .
controls were stained with secondary antibody alone .
at least 10,000 single - cell events were acquired for analysis .
brdu pulse - chase was performed with minor modifications from published protocols [ 23,24 ] .
following 3 days of dsrna mediated depletion s2r + cells were resuspended , and plated in fresh culture flasks with exposure to an additional round of dsrna to prevent the induction of quiescence [ 23 ] .
48 hours after this , cells were resuspended and harvested at 500xg .
these cells were incubated with 60 mum brdu in the dark , at 25degreesc for 1 hour .
cells were either harvested immediately ( 0 hours chase ) or they were harvested , and grown in medium without brdu for defined chase period .
for brdu detection , cells were harvested at 1000xg , washed with 500 mul ice - cold 1x hbss .
the cells were fixed and permeabilized using an ice - cold mixture of 1 ml 95 % ethanol ( in water ) and 100 mul 1x hbss .
for subsequent steps , cells were pelleted at 3000xg .
the ethanol - treated cells were rehydrated in 1x hbss for 5 minutes at ambient temperature , pelleted , treated with 2 n hcl in blocking buffer ( 1x hbss containing 0.1 % tween - 20 and 1 % bsa ) for 30 minutes at 25degreesc .
the acid - hydrolyzed cells were pelleted and washed with blocking solution .
finally the cell - pellet was incubated with 1:10 dilution of anti - brdu supernatant ( dshb # g3g4 ) in blocking buffer for 30 minutes at 25degreesc in the dark .
after washing the cells in blocking buffer twice , they were incubated with 1:250 dilution of donkey - anti mouse igg tagged with alexa488 for 20 minutes at 25degreesc in the dark .
the cells were washed with blocking buffer and 1x hbss .
finally they were resuspended in 1 ml solution containing 875 mul 1x hbss , 100 mul propidium iodide staining solution ( 0.5 mg / ml in 5 mm trisodium citrate ) and 25 mul of 1 mg / ml heat - treated rnasea , and used for flow cytometry .
at least 10,000 single cell events were acquired for analysis .
controls were cells not exposed to brdu but treated with all other reagents identically , including anti - brdu primary and alexa488 conjugated secondary antibody .
brdu , analysis were performed using flowjo software ( tree star ) .
relative movement [ rm ] and transit time through s - phase cells were calculated and plotted as previously described [ 25 - 27 ] .
results drosophila hemocytes recapitulate changes in mitochondrial morphology associated with cell cycle phases cell cycle - associated changes in mitochondrial morphology have been characterized in mammalian cells .
highly tubular mitochondria are observed during the g1 - s transition and fragmented mitochondria during mitotic stages .
[ 2,3,5,28 ] .
regulators of the cell cycle have been characterized in drosophila [ 29 - 33 ] ( summarized in s1 fig ) .
we found that modulation of these cell cycle regulators in drosophila in larval hemocytes affects mitochondrial morphology in a predictable manner .
on the basis of mitochondrial morphology , we categorized drosophila hemocytes ( fig 1a ) as extensively tubular , tubular or fragmented [ 15 ] .
most of the hemocytes from control larvae had tubular mitochondrial morphology ; a few had fragmented mitochondrial morphology while only a minority displayed extensively tubular mitochondrial morphology ( fig 1b ) .
ectopic over - expression of cyclin b , the mitotic cyclin , caused most of the hemocytes to display fragmented mitochondrial morphology ( fig 1b ) .
on the other hand , ectopic over - expression of the p27 ortholog dacapo [ 33 ] or of the cdc25 - type phosphatase string , increased greatly the fraction of cells with extensively tubular mitochondrial morphology ( fig 1b ) .
to correlate the mitochondrial morphology observed in drosophila hemocytes with the cell cycle phase they were in , we measured dna content from the fluorescence of hoechst 33342 and recorded the mitochondrial morphology in the same cell , with ectopic over - expression of either cyclin b or dacapo .
cyclin b over - expressing hemocytes that had fragmented mitochondria ( fig 1c ) contained twice the amount of nuclear dna ( fig 1d ) compared to dacapo - over - expressing hemocytes possessing extensively tubular mitochondria ( fig 1c and 1d ) .
these data suggest that ectopic expression of cell cycle regulators in drosophila hemocytes influences the cell cycle and hence the mitochondrial morphology .
together , these experiments show that drosophila larval hemocytes recapitulate the extensively tubular morphology of the g1 - s transition and mitotic fragmentation associated with cell cycle progression .
hence drosophila hemocytes will be used as a model system to determine how mitochondrial fragmentation affects the cell cycle .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0126829.g001 fig 1 drosophila larval hemocytes display cell cycle correlated changes in mitochondrial morphology .
mitochondria in hemocytes from third instar drosophila larvae are visualized using mito - gfp under the control of collagengal4 .
( a ) the hemocytes are classified on the basis of mitochondrial morphology as ' extensively tubular ' , ' tubular ' or ' fragmented ' .
( b ) overexpression of cell cycle regulators changes the distribution of mitochondrial morphology .
in control hemocytes , expressing mito - gfp and myr - rfp under control of collagengal4 , 2.3 +/ - 2.0 % cells have extensively tubular mitochondrial morphology , 71.5 +/ - 9.6 % are classified as displaying tubular mitochondrial morphology and 26.2 +/ - 10.3 % as fragmented .
overexpression of cyclin b eliminates the extensively tubular population ; cells displaying tubular mitochondrial morphology are reduced to 22.3 +/ - 8.5 % while cells displaying fragmented mitochondrial morphology increase to 77.6 +/ - 8.9 % .
the overexpression of dacapo shows the following distributions 24.5 +/ - 2.3 % - - extensively tubular , 61.1 +/ - 1 % tubular and 14.3 +/ - 3.6 % fragmented .
the overexpression of string shows the following distributions 27.7 +/ - 5.2 % - - extensively tubular , 56.2 +/ - 3 % tubular and 16.1 +/ - 3.8 % fragmented .
the overexpression of dacapo and string increases the extensively tubular population .
the histogram shows distribution of mitochondrial morphology ( mean +/ - sem ) from three independent experiments with at least 50 cells per experiment .
differences are significant by t - test ( control versus cyclin b , p < 0.05 , control versus dacapo , p < 0.01 , control versus string , p < 0.05 ) .
( c ) hemocytes derived from cyclin b overexpressing larvae have fragmented mitochondria ( recorded by mitotracker deepred ) and twice the dna content ( measured by fluorescence of hoechst 33342 ) , lower image , compared to hemocytes from dacapo overexpressing larvae that display extensively tubular mitochondria , upper image .
the differences in nuclear fluorescence can be compared from equally scaled , pseudo - olored images ( insets ) , where warmer colors indicate greater dna fluorescence .

scale bars a , c , 5 mum , and c inset 1 mum .
inhibiting mitochondrial fusion increases mitotic index mitochondrial morphology is maintained by a balance of fission and fusion [ 1 ] , allowing mitochondrial fragmentation to be achieved either by inhibiting fusion or by increasing fission .
we inhibited mitochondrial fusion by depleting the drosophila homologs of either mitofusin ( marf ) [ 34 ] or of mitochondrial phospholipase d ( mitopld ) [ 35,36 ] using gal4 and uas - rnai to achieve cell - type specific depletion of the gene product by rna interference .
the expression of the double - stranded construct in larval hemocytes was achieved by using collagengal4 that has been previously used to ectopically express gene - products in these cells [ 14 ] .
depletion of mitofusin or of mitopld produced mitochondrial fragmentation ( fig 2a ) .
to test the effect of this morphological change on the cell cycle , we estimated the number of circulating hemocytes in these larvae .
depletion of mitofusin or mitopld doubled the number of circulating larval hemocytes compared to control larvae ( fig 2b ) .
this increase in cell number was consistent with an increase in mitosis .
excessive depletion of mitofusin using two copies of both the gal4 and the rnai construct produced melanotic masses in larvae ( fig 2c ) , similar to those observed upon over - expression of ras [ 14 ] .
to verify the mitotic origin of the phenotype ( increase in cell number ) , we labeled hemocytes for the mitotic marker phospho - ( serine - 10 ) histone h3 ( hereafter phosphohistone h3 , fig 2d ) and obtained the mitotic index .
the mitotic index increased 6 - fold upon depletion of mitofusin and 3 - fold upon depletion of mitopld ( fig 2e ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0126829.g002 fig 2 depletion of mitochondrial fusion proteins increases cell number and mitotic index .
( a ) drosophila homolog of mitofusin or of mitopld was depleted by expressing the uas - rnai construct in larval hemocytes using collagengal4 , mitochondrial morphology was imaged by mitotracker deepred staining and classified ( as illustrated in fig 2 ) .
in the controls , i.e. , cells depleted of the unrelated gene or47 using collagengal4 , 64.4 +/ - 2.3 % cells have tubular mitochondrial morphology and 35.6 +/ - 2.3 % cells have fragmented mitochondrial morphology .
upon depleting mitofusin 95.3 +/ - 2.7 % cells , and on depleting mitopld 88.2 +/ - 2.7 % cells display fragmented mitochondrial morphology .
( b ) the number of circulating hemocytes per larva was estimated using a neubauer chamber .
control larvae contain 5300 +/ - 900 circulating hemocytes per larva .
depletion of mitofusin ( collagengal4 > marf rnai ) increases this number to 11480 +/ - 1480 , while depletion of mitopld ( collagengal4 > mitopld rnai ) increases it to 10490 +/ - 1360 circulating hemocytes per larva .
histogram represents data from 3 independent experiments with 2 to 6 larvae per genotype per experiment .
the differences are significant by t - test , p < 0.01 .
( c ) third instar larvae excessively depleted of mitofusin ( collagengal4 / collagengal4 > marf rnai / marf rnai , right ) displayed melanotic masses ( arrowhead ) consistent with an increase in cell number , while control larvae ( cs - bz , left ) did not show such masses .
inset shows a magnified view of one of these melanotic masses .
( d ) mitotic hemocytes were detected by phospho ( serine - 10 ) histone h3 labeling , and the stage within mitosis detected by relative arrangement of the tubulin spindle and the chromatin - ( i , iv ) metaphase , ( ii , v ) anaphase , ( iii , vi ) telophase .
( e ) correlating with the number of circulating hemocytes , controls have low mitotic index ( 0.27 +/ - 0.13 ) .
depletion of mitofusin in the hemocytes increased the mitotic index by 5 - fold to 1.73 +/ - 0.41 , while depletion of mitopld increased it by 3 - fold to 0.8 +/ - 0.19 .
the increases are significant ( p < 0.05 , t - test ) .
( f , g ) drosophila larval hemocytes overexpressing gfp - drp1 ( green ) have fragmented mitochondria ( mitotracker deepred , red ) .
( h ) drosophila larval hemocytes possessing fragmented mitochondria due to drp1 overexpression have the same mitotic index as cells from control larvae ( overexpressing mcd8 - gfp ) and containing tubular mitochondria .
thus , fragmenting mitochondria by increased fission does not increase mitotic index .
next we probed if mitochondrial fragmentation achieved by increasing fission also produced the same phenotype .
mitochondria were fragmented in hemocytes over - expressing gfp - drp1 ( fig 2f and 2g ) but this did not affect the mitotic index ( fig 2h ) .
thus increased mitochondrial fragmentation by itself does not seem to affect the cell cycle .
the robustness of these observations was tested further in the wing pouch region of the wing imaginal disc of drosophila larvae .
mitofusin or mitopld was depleted in the wing pouch using scallopedgal4 [ 17 ] .
this led to a 1.5 - fold increase in mitotic phosphohistone h3 punctae ( fig 3a and 3b ) .
as in the larval hemocytes , over - expression of gfp - drp1 did not change the number of phosphohistone h3 punctae as compared to gfp over - expression controls ( fig 3c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0126829.g003 fig 3 mitochondrial fusogens regulate cell cycle across cell types .
( a ) punctae of phosphohistone h3 counted in the proliferating wing pouch region of drosophila third instar larval wing disc .
mitofusin depleted wing pouch ( scallopedgal4 > mitofusin rnai ) contains more phosphohistoneh3 punctae than control wing pouch ( scallopedgal4 > or47 rnai , top ) .
( b ) control wing pouches contain 54 +/ - 7 punctae .
depletion of mitofusin increases the number of punctae to 77 +/ - 6 and the depletion of mitopld increases this to 65 +/ - 7 .
values are mean +/ - sem from 3 larave per genotype and the increase in number is significant ( p < 0.05 , mann - whitney test ) .
( c ) overexpression of gfp - drp1 in the wing pouch ( scallopedgal4 > gfp - drp1 ) does not change the number of phosphohistone h3 - positive spots compared to controls overexpressing mcd8 - gfp ( scallopedgal4 > mcd8 - gfp ) .
the overexpression of gfp itself can increase the number of punctae .
( d ) s2r + cells are classified as tubular or fragmented , depending on the predominant kind of mitochondria .
cells with almost equal proportions of fragments and tubules are classified as intermediate .
( e ) s2r + cells treated with mock dsrna ( targeting gfp ) are predominantly tubular ( 48.77 +/ - 4.83 %) , a minority display fragmented mitochondria ( 19.31 +/ - 4.71 %) , while the remaining are classified as intermediate ( 31.93 +/ - 1.9 %) .
s2r + cells treated with dsrna targeting mitofusin are fragmented ( 98.1 +/ - 1.2 % fragmented ) .
numbers are mean +/ - sem from three experiments with at least 100 cells per treatment per experiment , color scheme as in d. fragmentation is significant ( p < 0.01 , t - test ) .
( f ) the depletion of mitofusin increases the proportion of cells in the g2 / m phase of cell cycle by 8 % , compared to controls ( gfp dsrna treated cells ) .
( g ) the depletion of mitofusin increases the mitotic index of these cells from 0.025 +/ - 0.007 ( gfp dsrna treated controls ) to 0.125 +/ - 0.021 and ( h ) also increases the cell number from 1.1 x 106 +/ - 0.035 x 106 to 1.35 x 106 +/ - 0.13 x 106 .
differences are significant ( f , p < 0.05 , mann - whitney test , g , h , p < 0.05 , t - test ) .
since larval hemocytes could not be maintained as long - term cultures , mechanistic investigations were performed in the drosophila s2r + cell line .
in s2r + cells , mitochondrial morphology was characterized as tubular , intermediate or fragmented ( fig 3d and 3e ) with most cells in the g1 - and g2 / m populations ( fig 3f ) as analyzed by dna content .
depletion of mitofusin by introduction of dsrna into the cells caused mitochondrial fragmentation ( fig 3e ) and increased the percentage of cells in g2 / m by ~ 7 % ( fig 3f ) , increased the mitotic index by 6 - fold ( fig 3g ) and also increased the cell density ( fig 3h ). from a starting density of 1 x 105 cells / ml , control cells grew to 1.1 x 106 cells / ml with a doubling time of ~ 35 h. cells depleted of mitofusin had a small but significant reduction in the doubling time to ~ 32 h , reaching a density of 1.35 x 106 cells / ml in the same time .
these data show that across cell and tissue types , mitochondrial fragmentation by inhibiting mitochondrial fusion increases mitotic index and cell number .
however , mitochondrial fragmentation achieved by increasing fission does not affect cell cycle .
mitofusin depletion perturbs cell cycle progression we observed a mitotic phenotype , upon depletion of mitofusin .
cyclin b is responsible for progression of the cell cycle through the g2 / m checkpoint into mitosis .
hence we tested for the involvement of cyclin b in this context ( fig 4 ) .
in s2r + cells , depletion of mitofusin caused ~ 7 % increase in the cyclin b - positive population ( fig 4c and 4d ) .
within this population , the level of cyclin b ( geometric mean of anti - cyclin b fluorescence in the cyclin b positive population ) also increased ( fig 4e and 4f ) .

( c ) controls ( s2r + cells treated with gfp dsrna ) contain 12.2 % cyclin b positive cells .
( d ) in s2r + cells depleted of mitofusin , the population of cyclin b positive cells increases to 18.8 % .
( e , f ) the content of cyclin b in the positive population ( gates in c , d ) increases from 66.3 a.u ( controls , e ) to 71.7 a.u. upon depletion of mitofusin ( f ) .
to understand how the change in cyclin b content affected the cell cycle and cell number , we performed brdu pulse - chase analysis ( fig 5 ) .
s - phase cells were labeled by the hour - long pulse ( fig 5a and 5d ) and the brdu positive gfp dsrna treated cells show a gradual cell cycle progression ( fig 5a , 5b and 5c ) .
the brdu - labeled mitofusin - depleted cells accumulated in mitosis ( fig 5d , 5e , 5f , and 5g ) .
interestingly , measurement of relative movement [ rm ] [ 25,26 ] indicated that the mitofusin - depleted cells had a greater value of rm than the gfp dsrna - treated control cells ( fig 5h ) .
hence the mitofusin - depleted cells transited faster through the s - phase ( table 1 ) and also had a shorter doubling time ( 32 h as compared to 35 h for controls , as calculated from cell densities earlier ) .

we hypothesized that instead , a metabolic output ( atp , ros or ca2 +) of mitochondrial function influences the cell cycle .
consistent with this hypothesis , inhibition of fusion is known to result in dysfunctional mitochondria and an accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 37,38 ] .
upon staining for several ros species , we found that superoxide levels , as detected by dihydroethidium fluorescence , were greatly increased upon depletion of mitofusin ( fig 6a and 6b ) .
to determine if increased superoxide could affect the cell cycle , we depleted the two superoxide dismutase ( sod ) enzymes in drosophila larval hemocytes using collagengal4 and uas - rnai [ 39 ] .
sod converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide .
sod1 is localized to the cytosol while mnsod is localized to the mitochondria .
depletion of the mnsod led to an increase in circulating hemocyte number , but depletion of sod1 did not affect the cell number ( fig 6c ) .
thus , increasing mitochondrial superoxide generation causes an increase in cell number .
it is therefore likely that increase in superoxide content by inhibiting fusion may be the primary reason for the cell cycle defects observed .
we confirmed this by modulating mnsod protein in the background of mitofusin depletion in hemocytes ( fig 6d ) .
in this experiment , a single copy of the collagengal4 was driving expression from two separate uas constructs .
hence , the controls also had a similar genotype , where collagengal4 caused depletion of mitofusin as well as the over - expression of myr - rfp .
these larvae had increased circulating hemocytes .
over - expression of mnsod in cells depleted of mitofusin led to a reduction in the number of circulating hemocytes ( fig 6d ) .
measurement of superoxide revealed that hemocytes depleted of mitofusin and overexpressing mnsod had significantly lesser superoxide than depletion of mitofusin or of mitofusin and either superoxide dismutase as a combination ( fig 6e ) .
taken together , these results support the idea that mitochondrial superoxide is the signal responsible for the cell cycle changes described above , and mitochondrial fragmentation without an increase in superoxide is not sufficient to drive g2 / m transition .

( a ) pseudo - colored images of drosophila larval hemocytes derived from control ( collagengal4 > or47 rnai ) and mitofusin depletion ( collagengal4 > marf rnai ) and stained with dihydoethidium to monitor superoxide content .
warmer colors in the images corresponding to higher intensities in the lut bar match greater dihydroethidium fluorescence indicating greater superoxide .
( b ) depletion of mitofusin increases the total fluorescence per cell from 2.5 x 107 +/ - 1.3 x 107 a.u. to 6.3 x 107 +/ - 3.5 x 107 a.u. values are mean +/ - sd from a single experiment with 30 cells per genotype .
( c ) control larvae contain 4350 +/ - 647 circulating hemocytes .
depleting the mitochondrial mnsod increases this number to 9716 +/ - 240 circulating hemocytes per larva , however depleting cytosolic sod ( sod1 ) does not change the circulating hemocyte number significantly ( 5766 +/ - 1186 ) .
values are mean +/ - sem from 3 experiments , containing 2 - 5 larvae per genotype per experiment .
increase in cell number for mnsod rnai is significant ( p < 0.05 , t - test ) .
( d ) mitofusin depleted larvae , also expressing rfp , contain 11488 +/ - 2630 circulating hemocytes .
depletion of mnsod along with depletion of mitofusin does not increase the cell numbers further ( 9240 +/ - 2100 circulating hemocytes per larva ) .
however , the overexpression of mnsod in larval hemocytes depleted of mitofusin restores the cell number ( 3675 +/ - 650 ) to wild - type levels .
values are mean +/ - sem from 3 experiments , containing 2 - 5 larvae per genotype per experiment .
decrease in cell number for mnsod overexpression is significant ( p < 0.05 , t - test ) .
( e ) depletion of mitofusin and overexpression of mnsod decreases the total superoxide content ( as inferred from dihydroethidium fluorescence ) , from 8 x 108 a.u .
+/ - 1.5 x 108 a.u .
( the depletion of mitofusin alone ) to 5.4 x 108 +/ - 0.7 x 108 .
values are mean +/ - sd from a three experiments with 50 cells per genotype .
discussions we initiated a study to test if fragmentation of mitochondrial morphology constituted a component of the g2 / m checkpoint , in a manner similar to golgi fragmentation [ 11 - 13 ] .
using known regulators of the cell cycle , and correlating the mitochondrial morphology with dna content , we show that drosophila larval hemocytes are a tractable system to investigate the cell cycle .
cyclin b degradation is required for mitotic exit and the over - expression of cyclin b leads to an increase in anaphase cells and delay in exiting mitosis [ 32 ] .
when we over - expressed cyclin b , the hemocytes accumulated in mitosis , explaining the duplicated dna and the fragmented mitochondria .
over - expression of dacapo prevents entry into s - phase in the drosophila larval wing disc [ 40 ] .
hemocytes over - expressing dacapo accumulated at the g1 - s transition , hence the extensively tubular mitochondria .
conversely , overexpression of string accelerates the g2 / m transition but lengthens g1 - and delays the g1 - s transition [ 31,32 ] producing cells with g1 - s like mitochondrial morphology .
the depletion of mitochondrial fusogenic proteins ( mitofusin or mitopld ) led to mitochondrial fragmentation and an increase in mitotic index and cell number .
while the overexpression of the fission protein drp1 caused mitochondrial fragmentation , it did not replicate the cell cycle phenotype caused by depletion of the fusogenic proteins .
this indicates that at least in drosophila cells , change in mitochondria from tubular morphology to fragmented morphology does not constitute a g2 / m checkpoint .
however the inhibition of mitochondrial fusion can affect the cell cycle .
we find multiple changes in the cell cycle upon depletion of mitofusin .
these are - - increased cyclin b content , delayed mitotic exit , and shortening of the duration of the s - phase .
together , these result in a greater number of cells being detected as mitotic events , and a reduced total cell cycle time ( tc ) .
the increase in hemocyte number observed upon depletion of mitofusin could be reproduced by down - regulation of mnsod , but not by down - regulation of sod1 .
this implicates increased levels of superoxide as the driving factor for the cell cycle perturbation .
this interpretation is further strengthened by the observation that increased cell number due to mitofusin depletion is rescued by overexpression of mnsod in this background .
mfn2 and opa1 are proteins required for the fusion of mitochondrial outer membrane and inner membrane , respectively [ 41,42 ] .
loss of function of either of these proteins leads to neurodegenerative diseases , cmt2a and optic atrophy , respectively [ 43,44 ] .
the loss - of - function mutants of mfn2 or opa1 reduce mitochondrial fusion and also cause increase in ros levels [ 37,38 ] .
we find that depletion of mitofusin increases superoxide .
can the increase in superoxide lead to increase in cyclin b ?
how may this influence the g2 / m checkpoint ?
superoxide is known to be a mitogenic species [ 45 ] .
superoxide is quenched by the activity of two superoxide dismutase enzymes , sod1 and mnsod .
it has been hypothesized that increased content of superoxide , and the related species hydrogen peroxide , could induce proliferation through various signaling mechanisms [ 46,47 ] .
this is supported by the observation that the loss of mnsod ( implying increased superoxide ) converts quiescent cells into proliferative cells by upregulating cyclin b [ 48 ] .
conversely , the overexpression of mnsod ( implying greater scavenging and reduced content of superoxide ) downregulates cyclin b [ 48 ] and inhibits cell growth [ 49 ] .
superoxide may impinge on cyclin b through multiple pathways including cyclic nucleotides [ 47 ] , pten oxidation and activation of akt by phosphorylation [ 50 ] , also involving the transcriptional activity of nf - y [ 51 ] .
the detailed mechanism of this however needs to be investigated .
during a normal cell cycle , where mitochondrial fusogens are not manipulated , at the g2 / m transition cyclin b translocates to mitochondria [ 52 ] .
mitochondrial cyclin b increases mitochondrial superoxide output in two ways .
first , by activating respiration [ 52 ] and second , by causing degradation of mitofusin through phosphorylation thus inhibiting mitochondrial fusion [ 7,37,38 ] .
this critical level ( concentration or content ) of mitochondrial superoxide , which is specifically achieved during g2 / m could then exert a transcriptional activity supporting production of more cyclin b and hence progression of cells through mitosis .
cyclin b and mitochondrial superoxide could form a self - amplifying loop sustaining mitotic progression .
in our experiments , when mitofusin is depleted , we speculate that the content of superoxide radicals may cross this critical level , even though the cells are not in g2 / m. the resultant constitutive expression of cyclin b would then lead to aberrant cell cycle progression , i.e , accelerated progression through s - phase .
usually , the activity of the anaphase - promoting complex / cyclosome ( apc / c ) reduces cyclin b levels thereby triggering anaphase .
the nature of the cyclin b - mitochondrial superoxide loop indicates that the normal degradation of cyclin b could be probably delayed in mitofusin depletions .
this is consistent with the delayed mitotic exit we observe .
it is interesting to note that the inactivation of mitofusin is associated with lung cancers [ 53 ] , breast cancer [ 54 ] , colorectal cancer [ 55 ] and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 56 ] .
while ras and raf are implicated in these , especially where mfn2 is concerned , our results indicate there could be another pathway involving mitochondrial superoxide by which cancer cells could up - regulate cyclin b and hyperproliferate .
these considerations suggest that up - regulating mitochondrial fusion could be a viable cancer therapy .
the control of cell cycle by mitochondrial fragmentation has certain similarities , but significant differences compared to the golgi mitotic checkpoint .
golgi ribbon severing is brought about by the activity of bars [ 11 ] and grasp65 [ 12 ] , and blocking the activity of bars or grasp 55 / 65 leads to reduced recruitment and impaired activation of aurora - a at the centrosome [ 13 ] , which prevents activation of cyclin b - cdk1 and hence functions as a checkpoint .
the similarities between mitochondria and golgi are the change in mitochondria from tubular morphology to fragmented morphology at the g2 / m transition , and the correlation of cyclin b content with fragmented morphology .
the major differences are that mitochondrial fragmentation does not constitute a checkpoint ( at least in drosophila ) , and the observation that a product of mitochondrial function , viz .
superoxide may be involved in mediating the effect on the cell cycle .
this interpretation is strengthened by our experiments involving drp1 overexpression .
overexpressing drp1 increases mitochondrial fragmentation , but does not reduce mitochondrial fusion .
hence , the steady - state levels of superoxide would be maintained near normal levels .
in this scenario , though the mitochondria are fragmented , the cell cycle would progress normally .
this agrees with the model described above in which increased superoxide content could up - regulate cyclin b. the fragmentation of reticular membrane - bound organelles and compartments is likelier to lead to more equitable inheritance of the contents into daughter cells .
this line of thought is supported by a recent study with myo19 [ 57 ] .
myo19 , a myosin localizing to mitochondria , mediates equitable distribution of the organelle between daughter cells ; and depletion of myo19 results in a failure in cell division .
this block in distribution of the organelles can be overcome by inducing mitochondrial fragmentation .
it will be interesting to test if mitotic fragmentation of the endoplasmic reticulum also constitutes a g2 / m checkpoint like the golgi , or affects the cell cycle progression through its function .
supporting information s1 fig regulation of cell cycle progression in drosophila melanogaster .
cell cycle in drosophila is regulated at the g1 - s ( a ) and g2 / m ( b ) transitions .
( a ) cyclin e expression in the late g1 phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein rbf1 , releasing e2f1 .
e2f1 forms a complex with ddp that supports transcription and further expression of cyclin e. dacapo is a negative regulator of the cyclin e - cdk2 complex , and hence of the g1 - s transition .
( b ) cells in g2 are prevented from entering mitosis by the activity of the kinases wee1 and myt1 .
wee1 is cytosolic while myt1 is membrane associated .
among other targets , they phosphorylate and inactivate cdk1 .
independently , de2f - ddp upregulate the cdc25 - phosphatase , string .
string removes the inhibitory phosphate bound to the atp - binding site of cdk1 , thereby activating it. simultaneously , fos upregulates cyclin b. formation of the active cyclin b - cdk1 complex drives the cell into mitosis .

http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract background : troponin i is one of the most commonly tested biochemical markers in the emergency room ( er ) and in the hospital setting .
besides coronary artery disease ( cad ) , demand ischemia with underlying tachycardia , anemia , hypertensive emergency , congestive heart failure , kidney disease , sepsis , and pulmonary embolism have also been reported to cause troponin i elevations .
few reports have excluded patients with cad , and no study has summarized the proportion of these factors relative to an increased troponin i level .
methods : the aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the level of contribution of causative factors in troponin i elevation .
charts of patients tested for troponin i during an er visit or during hospitalization were collected .
patients with known cad , abnormal stress tests , cardiac catheterizations , or discharge without an adequate cardiac evaluation were excluded .
logistic regression was used to identify predictors of elevated troponin i levels .
results : a total of 586 patients were investigated in this study .
age , hemoglobin ( hb ) , heart rate ( hr ) , glomerularfiltration rate , atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure ( chf ) , and sepsis were significant predictors of elevated troponin i by analysis in univariate logistic regression ( all p < . 001 ) .
in multivariate logistic regression , sepsis , chf , age , hb , and hr were independent predictors of troponin i ( all p < . 01 ) .
a simple clinical scoring system was generated with 1 score on patients with age >= 60 , hb < 10 g / dl , and hr >= 100 beats per minute ( bpm ) .
the prevalence of elevated troponin i was 4 % , 16 % , 38 % , and 50 % for patients with scores of 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .
in patients without sepsis and chf , the chances of elevated troponin i were 2 % , 11 % , 28 % , and 43 % .
conclusions : sepsis was found to be the strongest independent cause of elevated troponin i levels in non - cad patients .
the scoring system composed of age , hemoglobin ( hb ) , and heart rate ( hr ) can assist clinical evaluation of elevated troponin i test in non - cad patients .
keywords cause analysis non - cad retrospective sepsis troponin i elevation open - accesstrue 1 introduction troponin i is one of the most commonly tested biochemical markers in the emergency room ( er ) and hospital setting .
elevated troponin i is diagnostic for myocardial injury. [ 1 ] coronary artery disease ( cad ) has been well known to cause the elevation of troponin i. [ 2 ] other than cad , increased oxygen demand of cardiomyocytes or decreased myocardial blood flow can also cause elevated troponin i , also known as type ii myocardial infarction .
the causes of demand ischemia have been reported as tachycardia , anemia , hypertensive emergency , congestive heart failure , kidney disease , sepsis , and pulmonary embolism ( pe ).[ 3,4 ] individual analysis of each underlying diagnosis has been shown in multiple studies .
troponin i elevation has been documented in sepsis patients without cad on autopsy. [ 5 ] multiple reports identified troponin i elevations in patients with congestive heart failure ( chf ).[ 6,7 ] it has been reported that the heart rate can be a primary dependent factor in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia ( psvt ) without cad. [ 8 ] elevated troponin i levels were documented in patients with atrial fibrillation ( afib ).[ 9 ] anemia in sickle cell crisis and acute gastrointestinal bleeding have been identified as causes of troponin i elevation [ 10,11 ] as was hypertensive crisis. [ 12 ] patients with chronic kidney diseases tended to have baseline troponin i elevation. [ 13 ] half of patients diagnosed with pe had similar laboratory findings. [ 14 ] however , there were only a few reports that excluded patients with cad , and no study has summarized the proportion of these factors .
the aim of this retrospective study was designed to investigate alternate diagnoses other than cad that could contribute to troponin i elevations .
2 methods 2.1 patients patients tested for troponin i in a local community hospital in scranton , pa , usa , between november 1 , 2016 , and december 15 , 2016 , were included .
exclusion criteria included patients with known cad or coronary etiologies , positive stress test or evidence of cad based on cardiac catheterization results during hospitalization , and patients who were discharged ( death or transfer ) without proper evaluation .
the study was approved by the institutional review board .
2.2 data collections analytic data were collected including age , sex , hemoglobin level ( hb ) , heart rate ( hr ) , systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) , and glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) by the cockcroft gault equation and underlying conditions , including chf , sepsis , pe , and afib. [ 15 ] the assay of troponin i utilized was the high sensitivity troponin i assay .
elevation of troponin i was defined according to the parameter of the hospital and was equal or greater than 0.03 ng / ml. if there were multiple troponin level measured during one hospital visit , only the highest one was documented .
among multiple hb level , hr , sbp records , only the closest one to the troponin i test was documented .
the clinical data were collected only once for the patients with multiple admissions .
2.3 statistical analysis normality assumption was not met , so the authors employed the mann - whitney u test to examine continuous outcome between patients with and without elevated troponin i levels .
the chi - square test and 2 - tailed fisher exact test were used to evaluate categorical data .
the association between elevated troponin i level and clinical variables by binary logistic regression was analyzed .
potential predictors of elevated troponin i included age , gender , hemoglobin level , heart rate , systolic blood pressure , glomerular filtration rate , presence of atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , pulmonary embolism , and sepsis .
these were comprehensively included in the univariate logistic regression .
factors with a p value less than 0.1 in the univariate model were introduced in to the multivariate logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds ratio ( or ) and 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) by forward selection .
a simple clinical score was created to predict elevated troponin i based on the results of multivariate logistic regression .
the discriminatory ability of the clinical score was evaluated using concordance statistics ( c - statistics ) .
statistical analysis was conducted with spss for windows version 20.0 ( ibm , ny ) .
statistical significance was set at a 2 - tailed p value less than 0.05 .
3 result a total of 1368 cases were tested for troponin i during an er visit or hospitalization .
five hundred and eight patients were omitted due to readmission .
two hundred and forty - seven patients had known cad or abnormal stress test / cardiac catheterization results during admission .
twenty - seven patients were discharged ( died or being transferred ) without proper evaluation .
a total of 586 patients were included in this study ( fig. 1 ) .

cad = coronary artery disease , er = emergency room .
baseline characters of the cohort are summarized in table 1 .
the mean age was 65 years old with 265 patients ( 45 %) being male .
among the 586 patients , 97 patients ( 17 %) were found to have elevated troponin i levels , 19 patients ( 3 %) were admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis , 54 patients ( 9 %) had a history of chf , 87 patients ( 15 %) had afib , 7 patients ( 1 %) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism , and 7 patients ( 1 %) were being treated with dialysis .
a total of 47 patients ( 8 %) were found to have hemoglobin levels less than 10 , 115 patients ( 20 %) were found to have an hr greater than 100 beats per minute , and sbp greater than 180 mm hg were recorded in 16 patients ( 3 %) .
echocardiogram ( echo ) reports were analyzed in 47 patients with a history of chf , and 20 of them had reduced ejection fractions .
total mean ejection fraction per available echo reports in chf patients was 44 % .
in total , 6 out of 47 patients with hb less than 10 g / dl had developed acute anemia secondary to hemodilution or acute blood loss .
table 1 baseline demographics among patients with and without elevated troponin i. patients with elevated troponin i differed from patients without elevated troponin i ( table 1 ) .
patients with elevated troponin i were older , had lower hb , sbp , and gfr ( all p < . 05 ) .
patients with elevated troponin i also had higher hr and were more likely to have afib , chf , and sepsis ( all p < . 05 ) .
in univariate logistic regression , age , hb , hr , gfr , afib , chf , and sepsis were associated with higher odds of having elevated troponin i ( all p < . 05 , table 2 ) .
when introduced into multivariate logistic regression , age , hb , hr , chf , and sepsis remained independent predictors of having elevated troponin i. when the analysis was restricted to patients without sepsis or chf ( n = 516 ) , age , hb , and hr were consistently independent predictors that contributed to elevated troponin i. table 2 univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses for elevated troponin i among all patients and among patients without sepsis and congestive heart failure .
a simple clinical score for predicting elevated troponin i was created based on the results from multivariate logistic regression ( table 3 , figs. 2 and 3 ) .
the authors dichotomized the significant predictors ( age , hb , and hr ) so that the score was clinically feasible .
the prevalence of elevated troponin i was 4 % , 16 % , 38 % , and 50 % for patients with scores of 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .
in patients without sepsis and chf , the chances of elevated troponin i were 2 % , 11 % , 28 % , and 43 % .
the score was associated with moderate discriminatory ability ( c - statistics : 0.712 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] : 0.657 - 0.767 ) .
when the analysis was restricted to patients without sepsis or chf , the score again showed moderate discriminatory ability ( c - statistics : 0.726 , 95 % ci : 0.658 - 0.794 ) .

4 discussion the authors identified sepsis as the strongest independent factor of troponin i elevation in non - cad patients in this study .
in previous reports , sepsis caused increased cytokines secretion , catecholamine surge , and tissue metabolic demand .
increased oxygen demand in peripheral hypoxic tissue can further increase the cardiomyocytes workload and cause relative insufficient coronary blood flow. [ 16,17 ] the forensic report also demonstrated evidence that sepsis caused elevated troponin i without underlying cad. [ 5 ] though troponin t has been reported as a prognostic factor in sepsis patients ,[ 18 ] troponin i ( which is the more common subtype in united states ) on day 1 of hospitalization was reported to have no prognostic value in sepsis patients. [ 19 ] it is not an uncommon practice for septic patients to have troponin i levels checked in the er on admission .
the authors conclude that checking troponin i levels in septic patients , especially without underlying cad , has to be done discriminately to try to curtail and additional unnecessary testing .
chf was also identified as an independent cause of elevated troponin i. congestive heart failure is known to cause sporadic areas of cardiomyocytes death , abnormal structures of the remaining cardiomyocytes , and ultimately progression to fibrosis .
thus , troponin i elevation can be caused by the cell necrosis process. [ 20 ] there are multiple articles that describe elevated troponin i in chf patients. [ 6,7,20 ] in this study , the authors identified chf as an independent cause of elevated troponin i level in non - cad patients .
however , chf can also be a complication of acute coronary syndrome. [ 21 ] thus , definitive decisions concerning the monitoring and interpretation of elevated troponin i levels will depend on clinical judgment during an er visit or hospitalization .
age was also noted in this study to correlate with increased troponin i levels .
it has been reported that age greater than 60 years old is a significant factor that can affect a troponin i level. [ 22 ] thus , the authors concluded that age related differences should be taken into consideration when interpreting the troponin i level .
heart rate was also an independent factor that affected the troponin i level .
heart rate has been well known to be a risk factor that causes increased oxygen demand .
this can lead to relative insufficient coronary blood flow. [ 23 ] it has been reported that heart rate can be primary dependent factor in patients with supraventricular tachycardia without cad. [ 8 ] this study reconfirmed that hr has a strong impact on troponin i levels in non - cad patients .
anemia was another diagnosis that was associated with elevated troponin i in this study .
anemia can cause a hyperdynamic status by increasing heart rate and contractility , which can further increase the oxygen demand of cardiomyocytes which then results in insufficient coronary blood flow. [ 23,24 ] abruptly increased cardiac index in patients with acute anemia has been demonstrated in a previous article. [ 25 ] anemia in sickle cell crisis and acute gastrointestinal bleeding were also reported to be associated with troponin i elevation. [ 10,11 ] in this study , anemia was confirmed to be a single independent factor for troponin i elevation .
however , there was no significant difference between acute and chronic anemia regarding troponin i levels .
there were only 6 patients who were diagnosed with acute anemia included in this study .
due to the number of cases , this cohort will need to be further studied .
the authors generated a simple clinical scoring system with 1 score given to patients with hb < 10 g / dl , age >= 60 and hr >= 100 beats per minute .
this was applied to patients without known or clinical suspicion of cad .
given that sepsis and chf were the 2 strongest independent factors , the scoring system was initially done on all patients with a second analysis done on those patients excluding sepsis and chf. with the lowest score , the chance of the patient having an elevated troponin i was 4 % versus 2 % ; with the highest score , the chance of the patient having an elevated troponin i level was 50 % versus 43 % .
the score showed moderate discriminatory ability and provided a tool that could be applied in clinical practice to try to identify subsets of patients who might have elevated troponin i levels due to the factors identified above and who do not generate a high clinical suspicion of cad .
in this report , sbp showed significant results in the mann - whitney test but showed insignificant results in logistic regression .
the data were further analyzed .
it was identified that within sbp 140 to 180 mm hg , the percentage of abnormal troponin i was around 7 % but increased to 16 % to 29 % in the rest of the sbp intervals .
the nonlinear correlation explained the statistic difference .
hypertensive crisis has been well described as a cause of cardiomyocytes ischemia .
the underlying pathophysiology could be due to impaired blood pumping from the heart due to increased afterload. [ 26 ] however , hypotension was also listed as a factor for elevated troponin i. [ 3 ] the underlying pathophysiology may be due to reduced coronary perfusion during a hypotensive episode. [ 23 ] further investigation is needed regarding hypertension and hypotension as causes of elevated troponin i levels .
atrial fibrillation ( afib ) was shown to have a significant effect on troponin i value in chi - square and univariate logistic regression in this study .
however , afib failed to show independent significant impact in multivariate logistic regression .
in this study , 87 patients were diagnosed with afib .
out of the 87 , 79 patients were greater than age 60 , and 20 patients had hr greater than 100 beats per minute ( bpm ) .
this implies that age and hr can be confounding factors in patient diagnosed with afib .
parwani et al analyzed 354 patients with afib and concluded troponin i release can be induced by afib .
however , the study included cad patients , and there was no control group of patients without afib. [ 27 ] thus , the association between afib and elevated troponin i levels needs to be further investigated .
in this study , gfr showed no significant effect on troponin i. the method used to calculate the gfr was based on the cockcroft gault equation .
none of the patients had quantified standard gfr urine test .
age was a numerator on the cockcroft gault equation and 193 out of 217 patients with gfr < 60 ml / min / 1.73 m2 are age greater than 60 years old .
this implies that age can also be a confounding factor in gfr in this study .
it has been reported that troponin i elevation is associated with chronic kidney disease and decrease gfr. [ 12 ] ziebig et al enrolled 24 patients after heart surgery with measurement of both serum and urine troponin i and classified the patients based on urine gfr .
this suggested that impaired kidney function affected the troponin i removal .
however , 8 out of 24 patients had myocardial infarction as a complication of cad in the study. [ 28 ] thus , a further prospective study with quantified gfr levels in non - cad patients may provide more information .
it has been reported that half of the patients with pe have elevated troponin i. [ 14 ] in this study , pe associated with increased troponin i levels was not statistically significant .
this may be due to the insufficient sample size ( only 7 patients with pe in this study ) .
there is 1 recently published study that revealed that sex , age , and sbp are strong factors of elevated troponin i in healthy adults with mean age 37 years old. [ 29 ] however , both sbp and sex failed to show statistical significance in this study .
based on real world clinical practice , the mean age of the patient in this study was age 65 years and many of the patients had comorbid ailments as listed .
current research regarding troponin i focuses on single factors as causative etiologies of elevated levels and rarely excludes cad patients .
in this study , patients with underlying cad were excluded .
this gave the authors an independent assessment of the other factors that led to increased troponin i levels .
there were several limitations in this study .
this was a retrospective study in a single center .
not all the patients had definite diagnostic tests such as cardiac catheterization , computed tomography angiogram , or magnetic resonance imaging to rule out cad .
however , all the medical records were reviewed and the patients enrolled were evaluated by hospitalists and cardiologists based on clinical judgment of symptoms and risk stratifications .
all the patients with known cad , abnormal stress test / cardiac catheterization results and patients without proper cardiac evaluation were excluded .
before doing this , the highest troponin i level was greater than 80 ng / ml ; after excluding the cad patients , the highest troponin i level decreased to 1.79 ng / ml. this implies that the patients left after omitting cad patients had milder cardiomyocytes damage .
a larger prospective study is needed for further investigation .
finally , although the score showed moderate discriminatory ability within the cohort , external validation is still needed to confirm the results .
5 conclusion troponin i is one of the commonly tested biochemical markers reflecting underlying cardiomyocytes damage .
in this study , sepsis was identified as the strongest independent cause of elevated troponin i levels in non - cad patients .
thus , the authors concluded that troponin i levels should be discriminately checked on septic patients , especially without underlying cad .
the scoring system composed of age , hb , hr provided an additional tool to assist in predict potential troponin i abnormalities .

abstract objective to compare the endometrial echo values obtained by transvaginal ultrasonography with the body mass index of postmenopausal patients ; to verify if there is higher prevalence of endometrial thickening in women with body mass index >= 30 .
methods this is an analytical and cross - sectional study that evaluated 294 patients .
postmenopausal women were included , and those on hormone therapy were excluded .
the variables evaluated were body mass index ( considering obesity if > 30 ) , number of pregnancies , years since menopause , and age .
these variables were correlated with endometrial echography .
results there was a statistically significant correlation between overweight and obese patients and increased endometrial thickness ( p = 0.0236 ) .
the correlation between age and endometrial echo was negative and statistically significant , that is , the older the woman , the lower the endometrial thickness ( p = 0.0478 ) .
pregnancies and years since menopause showed no statistical significance in relation to endometrial echo , with p = 0.0614 and p = 0.115 , respectively .
conclusion there was positive and significant correlation between body mass index >= 30 and endometrial thickeness .
resumo objetivo relacionar os valores do eco endometrial obtidos a ultrassonografia transvaginal com o indice de massa corporal de pacientes na pos - menopausa ; verificar se existe maior prevalencia de espessamento endometrial naquelas com indice de massa corporal >= 30 .
metodos trata - se de estudo analitico , transversal , que avaliou 294 pacientes .
as pacientes incluidas estavam na pos - menopausa ; foram excluidas aquelas que faziam uso de terapia hormonal .
as variaveis avaliadas foram o indice de massa corporal , sendo considerado obesidade quando acima de 30 , o numero de gestacoes , o numero de anos apos a menopausa e a idade .
todas foram correlacionadas com os valores de eco endometrial .
resultados houve correlacao estatisticamente significante entre as pacientes com sobrepeso / obesas e o aumento do eco endometrial ( p = 0,0236 ) .
a correlacao entre idade e valores de eco endometrial foi negativa e significante , isto e , quanto maior a idade , menor o eco ( p = 0,0478 ) .
gestacoes e anos apos a menopausa nao demonstraram significancia com relacao ao eco endometrial , com p = 0,0614 e p = 0,115 , respectivamente .
conclusao houve correlacao positiva e significante entre o aumento do eco endometrial e o indice de massa corporal >= 30 .
keywords : obesity endometrium / anatomy & physiology body mass index introduction the endometrium is a dynamic tissue that responds to variations in the levels of estrogen and progesterone , promoting proliferation , differentiation and desquamation. ( 1 ) biological and morphological changes may occur in the stroma and in endometrial glands , ranging from overproliferation to carcinoma. ( 2,3 ) this may occur when the tissue is exposed to estrogen without the counterbalance of progesterone. ( 1 ) this excessive exposure takes place especially in anovulatory cycles , polycystic ovary syndromes , estrogen secreting ovarian tumors , and obesity .
augmented fat tissue increases the action of the enzyme aromatase on androstenedione , thus increasing the quantity of stroma in the fat tissue .
for this reason , obese patients are at greater risk of developing estrogen - dependent conditions. ( 1,3,4 ) obesity plays an important role in endometrial proliferation , having as its consequence endometrial hyperplasia with or without atypias .
giede et al. demonstrated that among patients with endometrial hyperplasia with atypia , 35.7 % also presented endometrium carcinoma .
according to the authors , the progression of atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma occurs in 23 to 25 % of the cases. ( 5 - 7 ) this fact is relevant because this is the seventh most frequent type of cancer among women , with , approximately , 290 thousand new cases per year in the world .
the prevalence in developed countries is ten times greater than in developing countries .
in brazil , according to the instituto nacional do cancer ( inca ) , an incidence of four new cases of endometrial hyperplasia per each 100,000 women was expected in 2012. ( 8 ) the overexposure to estrogen in obese patients plays a fundamental role in endometrial alterations ( 9 ) , and this an important risk factor for endometrial cancer. ( 10 ) in this manner , the detection of endometrial hyperplasia in its early stages is relevant in terms of public health. ( 11 ) according to the world health organization ( who ) , 12 % of the world population is considered obese , and 3 million people die every year due to diseases associated to obesity - which is defined as abnormal or excessive accumulation of fat in the body. ( 12 ) the most frequently used indicator to identify obese people is the body mass index ( bmi ) , calculated as the individual 's weight ( in kilograms ) divided by the square of the height ( in meters ) .
obesity is defined as bmi above 30 .
values between 25 and 29.9 are considered overweight and from 18.5 to 24.9 , eutrophic. ( 10 ) the measurement of endometrial echography ( ee ) by ultrasound varies according to the phase of the woman 's menstrual cycle .
during desquamation the endometrial thickness varies from 0.5 to 7mm ; in the proliferative phase , it may become as thick as 15mm , remaining stable in the second phase of the cycle .
in post - menopause , ee is < 5mm up to 8mm in patients on hormone therapy. ( 13,14 ) objective to relate the values of the endometrial echography with the body mass index of postmenopausal patients and find if there is a greater prevalence of endometrial thickening in those with body mass index >= 30 .
methods the study was submitted and approved by the research ethics committee of the hospital do servidor publico estadual " francisco morato de oliveira " , in sao paulo ( caae 08327613.6.0000.5463 ) .
patients read and signed an informed consent form .
it is an analytical , cross - sectional study that assessed 294 patients who received care in the gynecology outpatient clinic by the project called care ( acronym in portuguese ) of the hospital do servidor publico estadual de sao paulo " francisco morato de oliveira " .
this project provides gynecological care and performs routine tests on a single day .
data collection took place between may 15 and june 20 , 2012 .
all patients included were postmenopausal .
those on hormone therapy were excluded .
some comorbidities , such as hypertension , diabetes and hypothyreoidism , were not considered exclusion criteria .
to calculate the bmi , all patients included in the study were weighed and measured by care 's nursing staff , on the day of the office visit .
transvaginal ultrasound ( tvus ) was done by the hospital 's radiology service .
in addition to bmi and ee , data collection also included age , date of last menses , and number of pregnancies .
obesity was considered for bmi >= 30 and endometrial thickening was considered if above 5mm .
all patients with this ultrasound abnormality had an outpatient hysteroscopy ordered .
data were tabulated using the software microsoft excel 2000 and tables were designed with the same program .
the statistical analysis correlated ee with age ( table 1 ) , parity ( table 2 ) , time since menopause ( table 3 ) and bmi .
analysis was done through correlation between ee and the previously mentioned variables .
table 1 ages divided into intervals and correlated with average endometrial echography , number of patients and percentages age average of ee values n (%) 40 - 45 3.75 4 ( 1.4 ) 46 - 50 3.10 10 ( 3.4 ) 51 - 55 3.04 60 ( 20.4 ) 56 - 60 3.37 58 ( 19.7 ) 61 - 65 2.85 70 ( 23.8 ) 66 - 70 2.81 41 ( 13.9 ) 71 - 75 2.43 20 ( 6.8 ) 76 - 80 3.76 15 ( 5.1 ) 80 - 90 2.88 16 ( 5.4 ) ee : endometrial echography table 2 correlation between parity , endometrial echography mean for each interval , number of patients in each interval and percentages parity average of ee values n (%) 0 2.53 35 ( 11.8 ) 1 2.60 24 ( 8.1 ) 2 - 3 3.19 139 ( 47.3 ) < 3 3.38 96 ( 32.6 ) ee : endometrial echography .
table 3 years since menopause divided into intervals and correlated with endometrial echography mean , number of patients and percentages years since menopause average of ee values n (%) 1 - 5 3.11 53 ( 18 ) 6 - 10 3.36 73 ( 24.7 ) 11 - 15 2.88 64 ( 21.7 ) 16 - 20 2.71 41 ( 13.9 ) > 20 2.96 63 ( 21.4 ) ee : endometrial echography .
non - parametric kruskal - wallis , spierman and duun tests were applied , and statistical significance was p < 0.05 .
results nine out of 294 patients analyzed had endometrial thickening diagnosed .
this is equivalent to a frequency of 3.06 % .
the mean ee was 3.04mm and average age was 62.3 years ( approximately 62 years and 4 months ) for all patients. with regard to the number of pregnancies , the most prevalent group was that of multigravidas ( second and third gestation ) , accounting for 50.2 % .
the mean time after menopause was 11.3 years , and average bmi was 28.67 ( table 4 ) .
table 4 mean values and variables variable mean ee ( mm ) 3.04 pregnancies , number multigravida ( second , third gestation ) age ( years ) 62.3 bmi 28.67 years since menopause 11.3 ee : endometrial echography ; bmi : body mass index. with respect to bmi , 73.8 % of patients presented an index > 25 , in which 108 ( 36.73 %) had a bmi between 25 and 29.9 , and 109 ( 37.7 %) > 30 .
there was a negative correlation between age and ee , demonstrating that the older the woman , the smaller the ee , with statistical significance , p = 0.048 .
as to years since menopause , there was no difference in relation to ee , with p = 0.115 .
the number of pregnancies also did not present a significant relation with ee , with p = 0.614 .
there was positive and significant correlation between bmi and ee , demonstrating that the greater the bmi , the greater the ee , with p = 0.0236 .
discussion with regard to age and ee , the statistical analysis demonstrated that there is a negative correlation between these variables , that is , the greater the age , the smaller the ee ( p = 0.0478 ) .
in postmenopause , the endometrium is atrophic. ( 15 ) although expected , there are no articles in the literature relating age with ee reduction , as reported in the present study .
other authors say that aging is not an isolated risk factor for endometrial disease .
most times , there was an association with underlying diseases , such as diabetes , hypertension and obesity. ( 8,10,15 ) we did not find statistical significance relating years since menopause with ee values ( p = 0.612 ) .
however , dossus et al. wrote that postmenopausal patients after 50.9 years of age present greater risk for endometrial cancer when compared to 49.8 year - old patients .
as to the number of pregnancies , parity and ee values , takeda et al .
( 1 ) reported that patients with an early menarche , late menopause , and nulliparity are more exposed to estrogen during lifetime , presenting greater risk of endometrial diseases .
dossus et al. ( 10 ) also mentioned nulliparity as a risk factor for endometrial cancer , but they do not mention this variable as a risk for endometrial thickening .
differently from epplen et al. ( 2 ) , who indicated nulliparity and obesity as risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia , with or without atypias .
the present study did not find statistical significance between the number of pregnancies and endometrial thickening ( p = 0.0614 ) .
the literature indicates that obese patients present greater frequency of endometrial thickening as compared to eutrophic women ,( 2,5,6,9 ) a statement which this study confirmed .
there was a significant correlation between increase in bmi and ee ( p = 0.0256 ) , but what drew our attention was that there was no difference between overweight ( bmi > 25 ) and obese ( bmi > 30 ) patients in relation to ee increase. that is , it demonstrated that there is no difference between overweight and obesity in relation to ee. canchola et al. ( 16 ) and charneco et al. ( 17 ) demonstrated that the risk for endometrial disease in overweight women is twice greater than in those with bmi < 25 .
obese people , in contrast , presented a four - fold greater risk .
among the 294 patients analyzed , 9 presented endometrial thickening - 3 eutrophic , 3 overweight and 3 obese .
in this manner , 66.67 % of ee alterations were in the risk group ( overweight and obese ) .
it 's necessary to comment about the profile of the patients analyzed. of the total , 217 ( 73.8 %) presented bmi > 25 and only 77 were considered eutrophic .
these numbers are worrying , considering that obesity is a risk factor not only for endometrial diseases , but also for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases , such as hypertension and thromboembolic phenomena .
this group of diseases has greater mortality rates than endometrial cancer and account for the death of 8.5 million women every year ( one third of all deaths in women ) .
cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women worldwide , according to the american heart association ( aha ) .
( 18 ) conclusion there was a positive and significant correlation between increase in endometrial echography and body mass index , demonstrating the influence of obesity on endometrial thickening .

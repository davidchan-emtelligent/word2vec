this study assessed whether recent screening recommendations have led to increased diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2dm ) through routine screening. methods .
respondents to the 2006 us shield survey reported whether a physician told them they had t2dm , age at diagnosis , specialty of the physician who made the diagnosis , and whether the diagnosis was made after having symptoms , during routine screening , or when being treated for another health problem. results. of 3 022 t2dm respondents , 36 % of respondents reported that t2dm diagnosis was made during routine screening alone , 20 % after having symptoms alone , and 6 % when being treated for another health problem alone .
the proportion of t2dm respondents reporting a diagnosis based only on screening increased approximately 42 % over a 15 + - year time span ( absolute increase from 31 % to 44 %) ( p < . 001 ) , whereas symptom - based diagnosis did not change significantly ( p = . 10 ) .
t2dm was diagnosed primarily by family physicians ( 88.3 %). conclusion .
these findings highlight the importance of regular screening for diabetes and the vital role of primary care physicians in recognizing individuals with t2dm .
1. introduction an estimated 20.6 million adults in the united states have diabetes mellitus [ 1 ] .
in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , complications are often present at the time of diagnosis , suggesting that clinical onset of the disease occurred years prior to diagnosis [ 2 , 3 ] .
symptoms of diabetes often go unrecognized or are assumed to be insignificant [ 4 ] , resulting in a delay of diagnosis .
at present , the american diabetes association ( ada ) endorses screening of individuals at high risk for diabetes but indicates that there is insufficient evidence to support cost - effective screening of all asymptomatic individuals [ 5 ] .
the ada recommends screening be considered at 3 - year intervals beginning at age 45 , and in adults with body mass index ( bmi ) >= 25 kg / m2 and who have additional risk factors ( e.g. , family history of diabetes , physical inactivity , certain races / ethnicities , hypertension , dyslipidemia ) .
the 2007 american association of clinical endocrinologists ( aace ) guidelines recommend annual screening for all individuals 30 years of age and older who are at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 6 ] .
in a survey of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2003 , researchers found that all diagnoses for type 2 diabetes were either serendipitous , in response to specific symptoms , or patient initiated [ 7 ] .
clark et al. found that most patients with a diagnosis of diabetes have little symptomatology or that the ada checklist of symptoms associated with diabetes lacks specificity for the disease [ 8 ] .
a study of 504 members of a medical plan in minnesota diagnosed with diabetes between 1995 and 1996 reported that the diagnosis was made for approximately 50 % of the patients at the time of routine visits ( e.g. , preventive care visits , chronic disease visits , preoperative assessments ) , and that the diagnosis for 43 % of patients was made at acute care visits ( e.g. , visit for acute respiratory infection , pain , cellulitis ) [ 9 ] .
these findings suggest that symptoms may be the initiating factor for a small percentage of healthcare visits , and that there is considerable variability in the care setting in which the diagnosis of diabetes is made .
the study to help improve early evaluation and management of risk factors leading to diabetes ( shield ) is a longitudinal , observational study of individuals with or at risk for diabetes .
this survey provides an opportunity to examine the means by which a large group of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus were diagnosed , and to determine whether there have been changes in patterns of diagnosis over time .
this study describes how individuals learned they have type 2 diabetes , the specialties of the physicians who made the diagnosis , and the rates of screening for type 2 diabetes .
the purpose of the study was to determine if diabetes screening rates have increased in recent years among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
2. materials and methods the shield study has 3 phases extending over 5 years : ( 1 ) an initial screening phase to identify cases of interest in the general population ; ( 2 ) a baseline survey for identified cases to collect health status , health knowledge and attitudes , and current behaviors and treatments ; and ( 3 ) four annual surveys to follow disease progression in individuals with an established diagnosis of diabetes , and the rate of transition from at risk to a diagnosis of diabetes .
the shield survey methodology has been described in detail previously [ 8 , 10 ] .
briefly , the screening survey was mailed on april 1 , 2004 , to a stratified random sample of 200 000 us households representative of the us population for geographic residence , household size and income , and age of head of household , identified by the taylor nelson sofres national family opinion ( tns nfo ) panel .
the screening survey was designed to identify individuals with diabetes and those with cardiometabolic risk factors .
a response rate ( computed as completed surveys / surveys mailed ) of 63.7 % was obtained from 127 420 households ( containing 211 097 adults ) .
the baseline survey was mailed in september and october 2004 to a representative sample of individuals , independently sampled ( n = 22 001 ) , who were identified in the screening survey as having type 1 diabetes , type 2 diabetes , or one of 6 risk factors ( abdominal obesity , bmi >= 28 kg / m2 , reported diagnosis of " cholesterol problems ," reported diagnosis of high blood pressure / hypertension , and history of cardiovascular disease ) .
each respondent group was balanced to be representative of that population for age , gender , geographic region , and household size and income for the us population , and then a random sample from each group was selected and sent the baseline survey .
a response rate of 71.8 % was obtained ( n = 15 794 ) .
in august 2005 , the first annual follow - up survey was mailed to the baseline survey respondents still enrolled in the tns nfo panel ( n = 19 613 ) .
the second annual follow - up survey was mailed in july 2006 to individuals who had returned either or both the baseline and first annual questionnaires ( n = 18 445 ) .
a 75 % response rate was obtained for the 2006 follow - up survey ( n = 13 877 ) , with 3 022 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
2.1 .
time since self - reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus respondents who self - reported a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus were asked to indicate the age at which they were diagnosed .
time since diagnosis was computed by subtracting age at diagnosis from current age and categorized into 3 - year increments to capture changes before and after the ada screening guidelines published in 2004 [ 5 ] .
these 3 - year increments also coincide with the ada recommendation for screening at 3 - year intervals .
this resulted in six categories for time since diagnosis : diagnosis made < 3 years , 3 to 5 years , 6 to 8 years , 9 to 11 years , 12 to 14 years , or >= 15 years previously .
age at diagnosis for type 2 diabetes mellitus was > 21 years since type 1 diabetes respondents were classified as age at diagnosis of <= 21 years .
individuals between 22 and 45 years of age were included because of the recent increase in diabetes diagnosis at younger ages .
2.2 .
method of diagnosis respondents who self - reported a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus were asked whether they were diagnosed because they were tested after having health symptoms ( symptoms ) , during routine screening / lab work ( screening ) , or when being treated for another health problem ( other health problem ) .
these categories were used to determine whether the 2004 ada screening recommendations [ 5 ] have led to a trend toward increased diagnoses for type 2 diabetes mellitus as a result of routine screening and decreased diagnoses based on symptoms .
specifically , respondents were asked : " how did you find out that you had diabetes ? was it found ...
( check all that apply )" with response categories of " during routine screening / lab work ( blood test , etc. ) ordered by my doctor " ; " when i was tested for it after having some health symptoms " ; or " when i was being treated for another health problem. " respondents could also check that they were diagnosed " with home testing " or " other ," but these responses were considered uninformative for the purposes of this study and not included in the analysis .
respondents were permitted to check multiple responses .
respondents with type 2 diabetes mellitus were also asked to indicate the specialty of the physician who made their diagnosis ( e.g. , family doctor / general practitioner , endocrinologist , cardiologist , neurologist , or other specified physician ) .
in addition , individuals were asked whether they had a cardiovascular event , defined as " heart disease / heart attack , stroke / transient ischemic attack ( tia ) , or narrow / blocked arteries / carotid artery disease. " because a cardiovascular event may be a trigger for screening and detecting diabetes mellitus , a subgroup analysis was conducted of individuals who self - reported a cardiovascular event and who were given a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes within a year of the cardiovascular event .
2.3 .
statistical analysis comparisons of the proportion of individuals reporting a method of diagnosis over time were made using chi - square tests for trends .
two - sided p values less than . 05 were considered significant .
3. results there were 3 022 respondents with type 2 diabetes mellitus from the 2006 shield survey , and more than half of these individuals were female ( 59.3 %) , white ( 85.0 %) , of non - spanish ethnicity ( 91.6 %) , and obese ( 63.4 %) ( table 1 ) .
there were 2 749 respondents with type 2 diabetes mellitus who reported only one method of diagnosis , and 273 respondents who selected 2 or more methods of diagnosis .
respondents with type 2 diabetes mellitus reported that they had had the condition for an average of 10 years ( median : 8 years ) ( table 1 ) .
approximately 22 % of respondents received the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus >= 15 years previously , compared with 14 % of respondents who were diagnosed < 3 years previously ( table 1 ) .
3.1 .
how individuals received the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for all respondents ( including those who selected multiple methods of diagnosis ) , 63 % of respondents reported a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus based on screening , 49 % reported a diagnosis based on symptoms , and 21 % reported a diagnosis based on other health problems .
respondents who selected only one method of diagnosis were then analyzed to assess differences over time without confounding with multiple choices .
analysis of solely the individuals reporting only one method of diagnosis showed that 36 % of individuals reported a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus based on screening alone ( table 2 ) .
twenty percent of individuals reported that the diagnosis was based on symptoms alone , while 6 % of individuals reported that the diagnosis was based on another health problem alone ( table 2 ) .
to determine if there was a trend over time in the method of diagnosis , the proportion of respondents given the diagnosis by each method was computed for each 3 - year interval since diagnosis .
the percentage of individuals self - reporting the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus based on screening alone increased approximately 42 % over time , from 31 % in the >= 15 years category to 44 % in the < 3 years category ( p < . 001 ) .
in contrast , the percentage of individuals receiving a diagnosis based on symptoms alone decreased by 34 % and the percentage of individuals diagnosed when being treated for another health problem alone increased 14 % over time ; these changes were not statistically significant ( p = . 10 for symptoms and p = . 59 for other health problem ) ( figure 1 ) .
there were 273 ( 9.0 %) respondents with type 2 diabetes mellitus who reported more than one method of diagnosis ( e.g. , they selected both screening and symptoms ) .
because respondents could select multiple responses , a separate analysis was conducted to determine whether the trend in method of diagnosis differed for respondents who self - reported any combination of responses ; however , no differences emerged .
3.2 .
specialty of physicians who made the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus most individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus reported that they received their diagnosis from their family doctor or general practitioner ( 88.3 %) ( table 3 ) .
few reported that an endocrinologist ( 4.4 %) had made the diagnosis , and even fewer reported that a cardiologist ( 0.5 %) or neurologist ( 0.7 %) had made the diagnosis .
this pattern did not differ significantly with respect to duration of diabetes .
3.3 .
cardiovascular events there were 826 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus who reported a cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction , stroke ) and age at time of event. of these individuals , 141 ( 17.1 %) received the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus within the year following the cardiovascular event , 23 % indicated that the diagnosis was made during routine screening , 21 % reported that it was based on symptoms , and 13 % indicated being diagnosed when being treated for another health problem .
4. discussion the 2004 ada guidelines recommend screening of individuals at high risk for diabetes mellitus on a 3 - year cycle starting at age 45 [ 5 ] .
early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus is a central goal .
the shield findings reveal that in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus , the proportion of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus detected by screening had increased from 2001 - 2003 to 2004 - 2006 .
most of the type 2 diabetes mellitus respondents were obese and had hypertension and / or dyslipidemia , making them appropriate candidates for diabetes screening .
these results also indicate that there was no significant change over time in the rate of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus due to symptomatic presentation or while being treated for other health problems .
a previous investigation using shield survey data found that approximately 70 % of respondents did not report having experienced the typical symptoms of diabetes from the ada checklist , for example , frequent urination and increased fatigue [ 8 ] .
moreover , only 45 % of respondents at high risk for developing diabetes ( had 3 or more cardiometabolic risk factors ) reported one or more of the classic symptoms of diabetes , and 55 % reported no symptoms [ 8 ] .
the presence of one or more of these classic symptoms alone was generally not sufficient impetus for an individual to consult a physician [ 8 ] .
the proportion of shield respondents diagnosed on the basis of another health problem was low (< 10 %) .
routine physician visits may be an ideal time and setting to implement screening .
a study found that approximately half of the patients were diagnosed at routine or scheduled physician visits , and 43 % of patients were diagnosed at acute care visits [ 9 ] .
in the face of the rapidly increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus , it is important that physicians identify individuals at risk for diabetes mellitus during routine visits and test appropriately .
additionally , other venues for screening should be explored , such as the new diabetes screening program for blood donors at the blood bank of delmarva [ 11 ] .
a cardiovascular event may serve as a trigger for screening and detection of type 2 diabetes .
it was not apparent in this study whether patients who experienced a cardiovascular event were more likely to be screened for type 2 diabetes .
screening was the most frequently mentioned self - reported reason for diagnosis in these individuals .
however , we were unable to distinguish those individuals who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus specifically because they had a cardiovascular event from those in whom the diagnosis was made for other reasons .
we had anticipated that specialists such as cardiologists would have been responsible for an increasing percentage of diagnoses , especially for respondents with a cardiovascular event .
however , our results did not confirm this hypothesis .
generalists ( family doctors / general practitioners ) continue to be the predominant specialty of physician making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes .
limitations of this study include the possible bias introduced by having only a small percentage ( 5 % - 8 %) of households agree to participate in the panel , and the data tend to underrepresent the very wealthy and very poor segments of the population , and do not include military and institutionalized individuals [ 12 , 13 ] .
respondents who selected home testing or " other " method of diagnosis ( 38 %) instead of screening , symptoms or other health problem for diabetes were not included in the analyses since it could not be determined if a physician had ever diagnosed them .
the exclusion of these respondents may affect the generalizability of the study findings .
the shield survey relied upon self - reporting of clinical data , including the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus , method of diagnosis , age at diagnosis , and the specialty of the physician making the diagnosis , without independent confirmation by the physician or examination of medical records .
recall of this type of information by the respondent could potentially differ for recently diagnosed respondents compared with respondents given the diagnosis more than 15 years previously ( median years since diagnosis = 8 ) .
prior analyses have demonstrated generally good correlation between prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus as assessed as self - report in shield when compared with the prevalence of diabetes mellitus determined by objectively measured survey such as the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) [ 10 , 14 ] .
although accuracy and validity of the self - reported method of diagnosis and age at diagnosis were not done in this study , other studies have shown a significant correlation and validity of self - reported data over long recall periods [ 15 - 17 ] .
age at menopause reported at an interval of almost 20 years showed significant correlation with a mean difference between first - reported and recalled menopause of 0.5 years [ 15 ] .
breast cancer survivors accurately recalled their treatment and number of invaded nodes with kappa >= 0.85 [ 16 ] .
women accurately recalled their cause of subfertility after 5.5 years with kappas of 0.50 - 0.79 [ 17 ] .
however , this study does provide data regarding the method of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a large sample of respondents who are representative of the us population with a high survey response rate .
5. conclusions this study showed that diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus by routine screening has increased significantly over the previous 15 years , with the increase occurring in the most recent years of 2004 - 2006 .
however , recognition of typical symptoms of hyperglycemia and medical testing as part of care for acute or other illnesses represent important means of detection .
these data support the need for more aggressive screening in order to maximize early detection and the benefits of early intervention .

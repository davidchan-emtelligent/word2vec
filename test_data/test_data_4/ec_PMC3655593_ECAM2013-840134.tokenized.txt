cordycepin ( 3 ' - deoxyadenosine ) is a naturally occurring adenosine analogue and one of the bioactive constituents isolated from cordyceps militaris / cordyceps sinensis , species of the fungal genus cordyceps .
it has traditionally been a prized chinese folk medicine for the human well - being .
because of similarity of chemical structure of adenosine , cordycepin has been focused on the diverse effects of the central nervous systems ( cnss ) , like sleep regulation .
therefore , this study was undertaken to know whether cordycepin increases the natural sleep in rats , and its effect is mediated by adenosine receptors ( ars ) .
sleep was recorded using electroencephalogram ( eeg ) for 4 hours after oral administration of cordycepin in rats .
sleep architecture and eeg power spectra were analyzed .
cordycepin reduced sleep - wake cycles and increased nonrapid eye movement ( nrem ) sleep .
interestingly , cordycepin increased theta ( theta ) waves power density during nrem sleep .
in addition , the protein levels of ar subtypes ( a1 , a2a , and a2b ) were increased after the administration of cordycepin , especially in the rat hypothalamus which plays an important role in sleep regulation .
therefore , we suggest that cordycepin increases theta waves power density during nrem sleep via nonspecific ar in rats .
in addition , this experiment can provide basic evidence that cordycepin may be helpful for sleep - disturbed subjects .
1. introduction purines are ubiquitous molecules with important roles in the regulation of metabolic networks and signal transduction events .
in the central nervous systems ( cnss ) , adenosine and atp modulate the sleep - wake cycles , acting as ligands of specific transmembrane receptors and as allosteric effectors of key intracellular enzymes for brain energy expenditure [ 1 ] .
adenosine levels are influenced by neuronal activity .
adenosine is a secondary by - product of the breakdown of atp and camp .
when atp is coreleased with neurotransmitters , ectonucleotidases in the extracellular space can rapidly dephosphorylate atp , adp , and amp into adenosine .
atp release from astrocytes also contributes to extracellular levels of adenosine that have a powerful modulatory effect on synaptic transmission [ 2 ] .
the role of this astrocyte - derived adenosine in sleep - waking homeostasis was recently investigated .
further research showed that systemic administration of adenosine , its analogs , or inhibitors of its metabolism increase nonrapid eye movement ( nrem ) sleep in rodents , especially [ 3 ] .
the local administration of adenosine and / or adenosine receptors ( ars ) agonists into the medial preoptic area of hypothalamus , magnocellular cholinergic basal forebrain , brainstem cholinergic areas , the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei ( ldt / ppt ) , and pontine reticular formation leads to sleep or reduction of wakefulness [ 4 - 6 ] .
in the basal forebrain , both cholinergic and noncholinergic neuronal activities are associated with promoting wakefulness [ 7 ] .
the somnogenic effects of adenosine may be due to the inhibition of neuronal activity in both cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain .
in addition , the modulatory effects of sleep deprivation on the a1r mrna in the cholinergic basal forebrain suggest the significance of an adrenergic pathway in the long - term effects of sleep deprivation on the quality of ensuring sleep [ 8 ] .
cholinergic neurons of ldt and ppt also comprise the cholinergic " arousal system. " during the transition from waking to sleep , the firing rate of ldt / ppt neurons markedly is decreased , reducing the cholinergic tone of their target sites and thus facilitating the transition to sleep [ 9 ] .
in particular , the ventrolateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus contains a population of sleep - active neurons and is hypothesized to be an important part of the somnogenic process [ 10 ] .
the four adenosine forms make up the family of g - protein - coupled ar : a1 , a2a , a2b , and a3 [ 11 ] .
the difference between the four ars is found in their affinity for adenosine , in the type of g proteins that they associate with , and the signaling pathways that are activated in the target cells .
for sleep - waking homeostasis , a1r and a2ar have received the most attention due to their expression pattern in the nervous system , the availability of selective agonists , and antagonists and selective molecular lesions of genes encoding the receptor subtypes .
a1 and a3rs have high and low affinity for adenosine [ 12 ] .
possible changes in adenosine functioning due to the aging process have been observed in animal models , and abnormalities in the adenosine system could also explain primary insomnia or the reduced amount of delta waves sleep and increased sensitivity to caffeine in some subjects with sleep deficits .
caffeine is a methylated derivate of xanthine with profound effects on the onset and quality of sleep episodes [ 13 ] .
this purine acts principally as an antagonist of the a2ar .
adenosine and atp in the nervous systems are the bridge between metabolic activity , recovery function , and purinergic transmission that underlies the daily wake - sleep cycle in mammals .
modulators of purine actions have the potential to alleviate insomnia and other sleep disorders based on their physiopathological role during the sleep process [ 14 ] .
cordycepin ( 3 ' - deoxyadenosine , figure 1 ) is a naturally occurring adenosine analogue and one of the bioactive constituents of cordyceps sinensis / militaris [ 15 , 16 ]. c. sinensis / militaris has been used for hundreds of years as a traditional medicine in treating disorders of the lung and kidney through mechanisms of immunomodulation [ 17 ] .
because of similarity of chemical structure of adenosine , cordycepin has been interested in the diverse effects of cns , like sleep regulation .
it also has traditionally been focused on the treatment of insomnia .
in particular , cordycepin is known to be a bioactive constituent to regulate homeostatic function [ 18 ] .
recently , some herbs have been the charming medicines for considerable sufferers with sleep disabilities or insomnia [ 19 ] .
most remedies of sleep aid originated from herbs have been targeted on gabaa systems .
however , recent morphological and functional studies have identified ar in the ventrolateral preoptic areas of the hypothalamus that plays an important role in sleep regulation [ 20 ] .
therefore , this study was designed to know whether cordycepin increases sleep via ar. this experiment also can provide basic evidence that cordycepin may be helpful for the treatment of insomnia .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
experimental animals male wistar rats ( samtako , osan , korea ) weighing 250 - 300 g were used for sleep recording and western blot .
each rat was housed in each acrylic cage ( 45 x 60 x 25 cm ) with water and food available ad libitum under an artificial 12 h light - dark cycle ( lights on at 7:00 am ) and at constant temperature ( 22 +/ - 2degreesc ) .
to ensure adaptation to the new environment , mice and rats were kept in the departmental holding room for 1 week before testing .
this study was performed in accordance with the chungbuk national university laboratory animal research center guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals .
2.2 .
experimental procedure after 7 days postsurgical recovery , cordycepin ( 2 and 4 mg / kg in distilled saline ) was administered to animals for 5 days once per day .
on the 5th day , 1 h after final cordycepin treatment , animals were caged in recording system , and spontaneous sleeping was recorded .
2.3 .
brain surgery and eeg recording each rat was implanted with a transmitter ( data sciences international , ta11cta - f40 , mn , usa ) for recording eeg and activity via telemetry .
the body of the transmitter was implanted subcutaneously off the midline and posterior to the scapula and was attached to the skin with 3 sutures for stabilization .
leads from the transmitter led subcutaneously to the skull , and the bare ends were placed in contact with the dura through holes made in the skull ( a : 2.0 ( bregma ) , l : 1.5 ; p : 7.0 ( bregma ) , l : 1.5 contralateral ) [ 21 ] .
the electrodes were anchored to the skull with screws and dental cement .
all surgical procedures were performed stereotaxically under aseptic conditions .
surgical anesthesia was achieved with pentobarbital ( 50 mg / kg , i.p ) , and all efforts were made to minimize the suffering of the animals .
telemetric recording of cortical eeg and activity was conducted using procedures similar to previous reports .
for the eeg signal , the gain of transmitters was set at - 0.5 /+ 0.5 volts per / units x 2 , and the raw signals generated from the transmitter were in the range of 0.5 - 20.0 hz. the signals were processed by a data sciences international analog converter and routed to an ad converter ( eagle pc30 , usa ) housed in a pc computer .
the ad converter digitized the eeg and activity signals at 128 hz. the digitized data were transferred to the computer and displayed graphically .
an online fast fourier transformation ( fft ) was performed on the eeg data at 10 sec intervals during data acquisition ( 1024 samples ) after a hanning window treatment .
the fft analysis generated power density values from 0.0 to 20.0 hz at a resolution of 0.5 hz. the fft data were further averaged in the range of 0 to 20 hz for every 10 sec .
the sleep data and fft results were saved to the hard disk every 10 sec for additional offline analysis .
movement of the animal in relation to the telemetry receiver generated transistor - transistor logic ( ttl ) pulses that were collected and counted as a measure of activity .
cordycepin was administered 1 hour before the eeg recording .
recording began at 9:00 am for 4 h. seven or eight rats were used in each group .
2.4 .
analysis of sleep architecture the amounts of time in wakefulness , nrem , and rem sleep were determined from the digitized data at 10 sec intervals using sleep analysis software , sleepsign 2.1 ( kissei comtec co. ltd. , matsumoto , japan ) .
briefly , the software discriminates wakefulness as high - frequency , low - amplitude eeg .
nrem was scored based on the presence of spindles interspersed with slow waves in the eeg .
eeg power during rem is significantly reduced in lower frequency delta - wave ( 0.75 - 4.0 hz ) and increased in the range of theta - wave activity ( 5.0 - 9.0 hz , peak at 7.5 hz ) .
the time spent ( min ) in nrem , rem , total sleep time ( nrem + rem ) , and numbers of sleep - wake cycle were processed to obtain 4 h period totals for each rat .
we further calculated the time of each recording spent in the sleep - wake state ( wake , nrem , and rem ) .
the absolute eeg power during wakefulness , nrem , and rem were calculated in 0.5 hz bins from 0.5 to 20 hz for the entire 4 h reading of each recording process [ 22 ] .
data from seven or eight rats in each group were analyzed .
2.5 .
membrane protein preparation after deep anesthesia ( induced by diethyl ether ) , animals were decapitated , and the brain was quickly removed and chilled in ice cold saline .
coronal sections were made using a rodent brain matrix ( asi instruments ) .
this was immediately followed by a 1,200 mum section containing the medial basal hypothalamus , and samples were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at - 80degreesc [ 23 ] .
frozen tissue samples were homogenized in pro - preptm protein extraction solution ( intron biotechnology , inc. ) .
the homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 g at 4degreesc for 20 min , and the supernatant was recovered .
a portion of the supernatant was collected to determine the protein concentration and for western blot analysis .
the concentration of total protein was determined by a modified lowry method using bovine serum albumin as a standard .
the samples were stored at - 20degreesc .
2.6 .
western blot the total proteins of hypothalamus were loaded in each lane , and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds / page ) was performed using 12 % polyacrylamide gels .
proteins were transferred to pvdf membranes ( amersham hybond - p , ge healthcare ) using a semidry transfer system .
receptors were detected with the following primary antibodies : rabbit antiadenosine receptor a1 ( diluted 1 : 1000 in pbs containing 0.5 % tween 20 , abcam ) , mouse antiadenosine receptor a2a ( diluted 1 : 1000 in pbs containing 0.5 % tween 20 ) , and goat antiadenosine receptor a2b ( diluted 1 : 1000 in pbs containing 0.5 % tween 20 ) .
the following horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were used : goat antrabbit igg ( diluted 1 : 5000 ) , rabbit antimouse igg , and antigoat igg ( 1 : 5000 ) .
after stripping , membranes were developed with rabbit anti - gapdh ( 1 : 1000 ; santa cruz biotechnology inc , usa ) followed by goat antirabbit igg to confirm equal protein loading .
immunoreactive bands were developed with a bm chemiluminescence detection kit ( roche diagnostics ) .
quantitative analysis of detected bands was performed with densitometric scanning , and all values were normalized using gapdh as a standard [ 24 ] .
2.7 .
statistical analysis all data were analyzed using spss 17.0 software ( spss ) .
significant differences after one - way anovas were measured by post hoc holm - sidak test .
p < 0.05 was considered to be significant .
the values are expressed as mean +/ - sem .
all statistical analyses were conducted using sigmastat software .

4. discussion c. sinensis / militaris which contain cordycepin ( 3 ' - deoxyadenosine ) , a naturally occurring adenosine analogue and one of the bioactive constituents , have been used for hundreds of years as traditional medicines in treating insomnia [ 15 ] .
in this study , cordycepin reduced sleep - wake cycles , increased nrem sleep , and decreased rem sleep .
it also increased total sleep time in rodents and decreased wakefulness .
interestingly , power spectral analysis showed that cordycepin significantly increased theta waves power density during nrem sleep .
therefore , it will be suggested that cordycepin , an adenosine analogue , plays a role in the modulation of theta oscillations in nrem sleep .
sleep in most mammals is divided into two major types of sleep , rem sleep and nrem sleep .
rem sleep is characterized by fast waves sleep with muscle atonia , activation of brain , and eye movement .
nrem sleep characterized by slow waves sleep is emerged in delta waves [ 25 ] .
during nrem sleep , neuronal activity , metabolic rate , and brain temperature are low. from the eeg experiment , cordycepin increased nrem sleep and reduced rem sleep .
however , it tended to increase slow waves in total sleep although they were not significantly increased .
on the contrary , theta waves in nrem sleep were significantly increased , delta waves in nrem sleep slightly decreased , and no change in alpha waves was observed .
theta waves between alpha and delta waves in wavelength specially were increased in nrem sleep [ 26 ] .
multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem , hypothalamus , and basal forebrain converge onto common effector systems in the thalamus and cortex .
sleep results from the inhibition of wake - promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors such as adenosine , nitric oxide , and gabaergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus , resulting in large - amplitude , slow eeg oscillations [ 27 ] .
one ubiquitous neuromodulatory system in the cns is operated by adenosine .
adenosine is an important homeostatic sleep factor acting in basal forebrain and preoptic areas through a1r and a2ar .
recent morphological and functional studies have identified ar in the ventrolateral preoptic areas of the hypothalamus that plays an important role in sleep regulation [ 28 ] .
adenosine neuromodulation is mostly conceived as an inhibitory system that restrains excitatory transmission through activation of inhibitory a1r .
furthermore , adenosine modulates the neuronal activity of basal forebrain and preoptic / anterior hypothalamic in the control of behavioral state [ 7 ] .
the sleep - inducing effect of adenosine is most efficient when adenosine or its agonists are applied locally into the basal forebrain and preoptic / anterior hypothalamus [ 29 , 30 ] .
the compensatory sleep response to sleep deprivation is significantly reduced when the increase in adenosine or a2r activation is blocked [ 31 ] .
a2ar is expressed in the brain areas such as striatum , nucleus accumbens , and olfactory tubercle [ 32 ] .
selective a2ar agonist administration into the subarachnoid space adjacent to the basal forebrain and the lateral preoptic area indduces nrem sleep [ 33 ] .
in contrast to other brain areas , increases in extracellular adenosine levels in the basal forebrain are very sensitive to even short periods of prolonged waking ; adenosine levels continue to rise throughout the waking period and do not decline until sleep is initiated .
as the basal forebrain is essential for wake promotion , the sleep - inducing effect is thought to be mediated via inhibition of the wake - active basal forebrain cells [ 34 , 35 ] .
prolonged waking activates inducible nitric oxide synthase in the basal forebrain , which causes adenosine release and recovery sleep through energy depletion .
there are numerous reports indicating that endogenous adenosine is a candidate for the homeostatic sleep factor theory inducting sleep after prolonged wakefulness [ 35 ] .
adenosine 's pivotal role in sleep modulation is strongly supported by the subjective and eeg - defined arousal produced by its antagonists , caffeine , and theophylline , as well as by the fact that extracellular adenosine concentration is linked to neuronal metabolic activity [ 1 , 36 ] .
researches showed that systemic or local administration of adenosine , its analogs , or inhibitors of its metabolism increase especially nrem sleep in rodents [ 37 ] .
the mechanism by which cordycepin increased nrem sleep and decreased wakefulness was probably achieved through activation of adenosine receptors .
thereby , we suggest that cordycepin mediated effects on sleep - wake states are site and receptor dependent .
furthermore , cordycepin may pharmacologically act in the same manner as that of adenosine as cordycepin has affinity at the a1 , a2 , and a3 receptors [ 38 ] .
for sleep - waking homeostasis , a1r and a2ar have received the most attention due to their expression pattern in the nervous system .
a1r is widely distributed in cns and inhibits especially cholinergic neurons from forebrain and ldt / ppt [ 39 ] .
stimulation of a1r results in adenylate cyclase inhibition and phospholipase c activation .
higher level of a1r agonist or higher expression of a1r potentiates the phospholipase c pathway [ 40 ] .
the activation of presynaptic a1r inhibits neurotransmitter release , mostly of excitatory neurotransmitter such as glutamate and acetylcholine. from this study , cordycepin activated ar subtypes .
so the present report strongly suggests that cordycepin enhances nrem sleep in activating upon ar. therefore , administration of cordycepin , an adenosine analogue , widely modulated the power spectral densities of eeg architecture .
increase of total sleep and nrem sleep by cordycepin might be related to the action upon ar. moreover , the mechanisms which cordycepin modulates eeg architecture and sleep behaviors may be attributed to the similar chemical structure of adenosine .
the use of several herbs in the treatment of sleep disorder , such as insomnia , is regarded as a developing market for agents acting on gaba receptors. st. john 's wort , valerian extracts , and ginseng species are the best examples of this issue [ 41 - 43 ] .
in addition , ginseng extract enhanced the total sleep and nrem sleep , and reduced the number of sleep - wake cycles [ 44 , 45 ] .
nevertheless , this is the first experiment that cordycepin , a natural product for the treatment of sleep disorders , such as insomnia , acts on ar. cordycepin is quickly deaminated by adenosine deaminase and rapidly metabolized to an inactive metabolite , 3 ' - deoxyhypoxanthinosine , in vivo [ 46 ] .
adenosine is otherwise transported into cells by several nucleoside permeases , and then the adenosine will be phosphorylated to form atp by adenosine kinase .
if the cell does not utilize the adenosine , it will be deaminated to hypoxanthinosine by adenosine deaminase inside the cell [ 47 ] .
so adenosine and cordycepin had short elimination half - lives and high rates of clearance [ 18 ] .
we also presume that cordycepin has short - acting compound in the regulation of sleep .
therefore , eeg recording was performed for 4 hours .
5. conclusions cordycepin , targeting on ar , can be helpful for sleep disturbance subjects .
thus , the results also indicated a role for cordycepin , an adenosine analogue , in the regulation of sleep and held promise for a new class of compounds as potential agents in the treatment of sleep disorders , such as insomnia .
cordycepin as an adenosine analogue increased nrem sleep and decreased rem sleep , suppressing waking .
cordycepin also increases theta waves power density during nrem sleep via nonspecific ar in the ventrolateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus of the rats .
further research would be necessary to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cordycepin - induced sleep modulation in the brain .
conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interests .

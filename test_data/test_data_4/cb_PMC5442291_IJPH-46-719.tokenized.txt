dear editor - in - chief all health systems are facing a paradox of limited resources against the unlimited human needs .
therefore , any country in the world is not able to meet all the health needs of the population and provide all services .
the available resource allocation in the best way possible is essential ( 1 , 2 ) .
priority setting is one way for good use of limited resources ( 3 ) .
priority setting in health care includes choosing among the possible options of the programs and health care services and patients or groups of patients who should receive it ( 4 ) .
one of the approaches that reflect the priorities selected , is to develop a basic health benefit package ( bhbp ) .
bhbp is the least services that should be available to ensure the proper condition of public health and protection against disease .
designing such a package has several benefits. with the pool of a number of interventions together , it may be possible to take advantage of common use of particular inputs and therefore reduce the costs ( 5 ) .
iran ( 2004 ) established the ministry of welfare and social security ( mowss ) to distinguish the funders and providers of health care .
since this time , health insurance organizations were under the mowss , and the high council of health insurance ( hchi ) was transferred to this ministry .
this ministry was merged ( 2011 ) with two other ministries and renamed to the ministry of cooperatives , labor and social welfare ( mcls ) .
iran 's health insurance system consists of numerous insurance organizations .
the main insurance organizations are social security organization , the army medical insurance organization , health insurance organization , imam khomeini relief committee ( 6 ) .
reviewing the existing requirements in the insurance system in iran shows that the insurance system is faced with some problems .
in this regard , the formulation and revision of bhbp have always been one of the main challenges in insurance organizations of the country .
in other words , these organizations are always faced with the question that , considering the dynamic of the health system , the introduction of new medicines and equipment to the health market , changing burden of disease in the course of time , and resource constraints , what process should be considered for formulation and revision of the services of this package .
this question has never been answered correctly in iranian insurance organizations .
despite the fact that article 10 of the law on general insurance in iran , referred to determination of the minimum scope and level of medical services and medications but in practice , no specific criteria and process for the review of the bhbp have not been mentioned .
documents show that since the founding medical service insurance organization in 1994 , the number of services covered by the insurance package has been increased .
on the other hand , a process does not exist for investigating the withdrawal of services from bhbp .
lack of revision of bhbp makes the service that lose their effectiveness over time due to advances in technology , changing disease burden apply additional financial burden to the health system .
the lack of updates in bhbp can be a factor in the increase in out of pocket and increase in families facing catastrophic costs .
one of the main reasons for the lack of review of the bhbp in iran is a difficult bureaucratic process imposed by regulation on its formulation .
in this process , the ministry of health & medical education ( mohme ) in accordance with article 10 provides its proposal to the hchi .
if the council agrees , the cabinet of ministers must approve it. during this process , the planning in the mohme and experts' talks in the hchi on the one hand , and long discussions in various government commissions , on the other hand delayed the inclusion of new services to the bhbp .
despite the cumbersome process , the review of the available services in the bhbp will not be considered .
in addition , the current structure of determination of the bhbp services lacks balance and sufficient competency .
the combination of experts in the process is more political and a combination of professional and academic people is less used .
for example , the combination of hchi members has been formed of ministers , representatives of insurance organizations and members of parliament .
the hchi does not have expert power for scientific analysis and decision making for inclusion or exclusion of the services from the bhbp .
another challenge for bhbp is low participation of some groups , including the private sector , public , ngos and health economists .
thus , it is essential to iran 's policy makers to design and implement an evidence - based process for reviewing the substance of bhbp .
in the design of the process of formulating and reviewing the package two important points should be noted , the use of professional experts and specialists , and the use of scientific tools and metrics to assess the services such as health technology assessment .

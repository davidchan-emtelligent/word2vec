failure of currently used cytotoxic chemotherapy is one of the main reasons behind high mortality from metastatic high grade serous ovarian carcinoma .
we found that high expression of a receptor for fractalkine ( cx3cr1 ) significantly correlated with shorter survival of patients with serous ovarian carcinoma treated with cytotoxic dna damage chemotherapies , and reduction of cx3cr1 expression resulted in sensitization to several dna damaging modalities , including x - ray radiation and cisplatin .
here , we show that cx3cr1 plays a role in double - strand dna break response and repair by regulating expression of rad50 by a myc - dependent mechanism .
we demonstrate that downregulation of cx3cr1 alone and in a combination with irradiation affects peritoneal metastasis in an organ - specific manner ; we show that cx3cr1 regulates lipid uptake which could control omental metastasis .
this study identifies cx3cr1 as a novel potential target for sensitization of ovarian carcinoma to dna damage therapies and reduction of peritoneal carcinomatosis .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction cancer metastasis remains a largely unsolved health problem worldwide1 .
among all cancers affecting women ovarian carcinoma is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy1 .
among all of its subtypes , high grade serous ovarian carcinoma ( hgsoc ) is the most predominant and lethal .
there are no effective therapeutic options to treat recurrent chemotherapy - resistant metastatic hgsoc .
patients with metastatic hgsoc undergo debulking surgery and first - line cytotoxic chemotherapy with a microtubule stabilizing taxane and a dna damage - inducing platinum agent .
however , intrinsic and acquired resistance to dna damaging agents remains a barrier for successful application of these powerful drugs2 .
novel approaches are urgently needed to restore and maintain efficacy of dna damage therapy to treat this deadly malignancy .
chemokine receptors are seven transmembrane g protein - coupled receptors that are activated by their ligands ( chemokines ) resulting in stimulation of the downstream signaling pathways and changes in cell behavior and function .
chemokine receptors serve as key regulators of many disease states , thus , providing a strong rationale for their development as drug targets for various illnesses3 .
chemokine receptors regulate the metastasis , and , therefore they have been used as anti - cancer drug targets in both pre - clinical and clinical studies4 - 6 .
a receptor for fractalkine , cx3cr1 is activated by only chemokine ligand fractalkine ( cx3cl1 ) , which could be present in both secreted and membrane - tethered forms7,8 .
our previous studies demonstrated that interaction of cx3cr1 expressed in ovarian carcinoma cells with membrane - tethered cx3cl1 expressed in peritoneal mesothelial cells mediates peritoneal adhesion of disseminating cells9 .
we and others have shown that secreted cx3cl1 facilitates ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro9,10 .
we have demonstrated that ovarian cancer cell proliferation at metastatic sites is dependent on cx3cl1 expressed by parenchyma of intraperitoneal organs and tissues11 .
here , we demonstrate that cx3cr1 can regulate double - strand dna break repair in hgsoc cells subjected to therapeutic agents inducing dna damage , such as x - ray radiation and platinum - based agents .
our studies also suggest that cx3cr1 facilitates fatty acid ( fa ) uptake .
together , these mechanisms converge in promoting omental metastasis in a xenograft mouse model of the disease .
results transient downregulation of cx3cr1 sensitizes hgsoc cell lines to dna damage inducing therapies expression of cx3cr1 predicts survival in patients treated with platinum therapy , gemcitabine , and topotecan we used kaplan - meier plotter database for serous ovarian cancer12,13 to analyze survival of patients treated with the standard of care and second - line chemotherapies , including platinum , gemcitabine , and topotecan , as a function of cx3cr1 expression .
we have found that both overall ( os ) and progression - free ( pfs ) survivals were significantly shorter when cx3cr1 expression was high ( fig. 1 ) .
these data suggest that cx3cr1 could be considered a biomarker of response to these therapies .
platinum drugs , gemcitabine , and topotecan kill proliferating cells by affecting dna by different mechanisms ; however , one common feature is formation of double - strand dna breaks ( dsbs ) , which , if not repaired , lead to cell death14 - 17 .
hence , these data suggest that cx3cr1 may be involved in double - strand dna repair ( ddr ). fig. 1 expression of cx3cr1 predicts survival of serous ovarian carcinoma patients treated with dna damaging agents .
high cx3cr1 expression predicts shorter overall ( os ) and progression - free ( pfs ) survivals of serous ovarian carcinoma patients treated with platinum therapies ( a ) , gemcitabine ( b ) , and topotecan ( c ) .
os and pfs of serous ovarian carcinoma patients were analyzed using km plotter database .
red lines - - high cx3cr1 , black lines - - low cx3cr1 .
numbers of specimens with high ( red ) and low ( black ) cx3cr1 for each analyzed group and their corresponding average survival are shown in the tables .
the best performing threshold was used to determine cx3cr1 - low and cx3cr1 - high groups of specimens using km plotter software .
expression of cx3cr1 in examined specimens is plotted as beeswarm plots shown as inserts ; red - - high cx3cr1 , black - - low cx3cr1 .
survival was analyzed with mantel - cox log - rank test using km plotter software ; hazard ratios ( hr ) and p - values are indicated on the graphs downregulation of cx3cr1 synergizes with x - ray radiation in reducing clonogenic ability of hgsoc to determine the role of cx3cr1 in ddr , we used x - ray radiation as a tool to induce dsbs in hgsoc cell lines .
expression of cx3cr1 in cell lines ovcar - 4 , caov - 3 , and skov - 3 was transiently downregulated using a pool of cx3cr1 - specific sirnas .
the choice of these cell lines as models of hgsoc was motivated by studies demonstrating that the genomic and proteomic profiles of ovarian carcinoma cell lines ovcar - 4 and caov - 3 bear close resemblance to those of hgsocs , while proteomic profiling of skov - 3 suggested that this cell line mimics a more deadly mesenchymal subtype of hgsoc18,19 .
transient downregulation was given preference to the stable downregulation to avoid reduction of proliferation due to loss of the functional cx3cl1 / cx3cr1 axis , as reported before9,10 , which would greatly impact the outcomes of the clonogenic assay ; instead , our goal was to discern the role of cx3cr1 in cellular ability to tolerate dna damage .
downregulation of cx3cr1 in all tested cell lines synergized with x - ray radiation in significantly reducing their clonogenic ability ( fig. 2 , supplementary figure 1 ) .
while the parental cells were able to completely recover from the relatively low doses of radiation ( 1 gray for ovcar - 4 and caov - 3 and 3 gray for skov - 3 ) , those with transiently downregulated cx3cr1 lost 40 - 50 % of their clonogenic ability .
in fact , double dose of radiation ( 2 gray for ovcar - 4 and caov - 3 and 7 gray for skov - 3 ) was required to achieve this level of reduction of clonogenic ability in the parental cells .
these data further suggested a potential role for cx3cr1 in dna damage response ( ddr ). fig. 2 downregulation of cx3cr1 synergizes with x - ray radiation to reduce clone formation of hgsoc cell lines .
ovcar - 4 was transiently transfected with either cx3cr1 - specific ( designated " cx3cr1si ") or control ( designated " ctrl si ") si rnas or vehicle ( designated " nt ") and subjected to 0 , 1 , 2 , or 3 gray x - ray radiation on the third day following transfection .

cx3cr1 expression was determined by western blot ; actb was used as loading control , and normalized expression of cx3cr1 was calculated using digital densitometry .

although immunoreactivity of nuclear gamma - h2ax in cells transfected with control sirnas was high 20 min post x - ray exposure , significantly fewer gamma - h2ax - immunoreactive foci were detected in irradiated cells transfected with cx3cr1 sirnas at the same time point , indicating that detection of the dsbs in irradiated cells with downregulated cx3cr1 may have been delayed .
in fact , 24 h following radiation exposure , gamma - h2ax signal in the nuclei of control cells was very low , indicating that dsbs were successfully repaired .
on the contrary , gamma - h2ax immunoreactivity was very strong in the nuclei of cells with downregulated cx3cr1 ( fig. 3a , supplementary figure 2 and 3a ) , suggesting delayed or impaired dna damage recognition or repair in these cells .
it has been previously suggested that retention of gamma - h2ax foci indicates lethal dna damage21 .
to ascertain that downregulation of cx3cr1 coupled with radiation exposure induced dsbs , we conducted a neutral comet assay and found that downregulation of cx3cr1 resulted in significant increase in dna damage in comparison to controls with intact cx3cr1 expression ( fig. 3b , supplementary figure 3b ). fig. 3 combination of cx3cr1 downregulation and x - ray radiation induces double - strand dna breaks in hgsoc cell lines .
ovcar - 4 was transiently transfected with either cx3cr1 - specific ( designated " cx3cr1si ") , control ( designated " ctrl si ") , or vehicle ( designated " nt ") and subjected to 0 or 1 gray x - ray on the third day following transfection .

bar , 10 mum downregulation of cx3cr1 results in deactivation of dna damage repair - related kinases it has been shown that downregulation of another chemokine receptor , c - x - c motif chemokine receptor 2 , resulted in impairment of ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( atm ) kinase activation and decreased intensity of dna damage response foci in irradiated lung fibroblasts22 .
hence , we hypothesized that downregulation of cx3cr1 in epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells may lead to the same response in irradiated cells .
in fact , we found that the number of phospho - atm foci in irradiated cells with downregulated cx3cr1 was significantly lower than in irradiated controls with intact cx3cr1 expression ( fig. 4a , supplementary figure 4a ) .
furthermore , addition of an inhibitor of atm , ku55933 , to irradiated cells with downregulated cx3cr1 nearly obliterated atm activation and further radiosensitized cells ( supplementary figure 5 ). fig. 4 downregulation of cx3cr1 leads to reduced activation of dna damage repair - related kinases in irradiated hgsoc cells .
ovcar - 4 was transiently transfected with either cx3cr1 - specific ( designated " cx3cr1si ") , control ( designated " ctrl si ") , or vehicle ( designated " nt ") and subjected to 0 or 1 gray x - ray on the 3rd day following transfection .

normalized expression of phospho - atm , phospho - chek1 , phospho - chek2 , and phospho - prkdc was quantified with digital densitometry and plotted .
* p < 0.05 , student 's t test as repair of the dsbs caused by ionizing radiation is conducted via both non - homologous end joining ( nhej ) and homologous recombination ( hr ) 23 - 25 , we tested activation of dna damage response kinases , including atm kinase , checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 ( chek1 and chek2 ) , and dna - dependent protein kinase , catalytic subunit ( dna - pkcs or prkdc ) , using western blot .
all of the examined kinases were activated in response to x - ray radiation in the control cells ( nt and ctrl si ) ; however , downregulation of cx3cr1 resulted in significantly reduced activation of atm , chek1 , chek2 , and prkdc in irradiated cells ( fig. 4b , supplementary figure 5b,c ) , suggesting impairment of both nhej and hr. these data indicated that irradiation of cells with reduced cx3cr1 expression did not activate dna damage sensor and mediator kinases at the same level as it did in the control cells , suggesting a potential impairment of dna damage repair pathways along both hr and nhej mechanisms .
cx3cr1 regulates expression of rad50 a protein complex consisting of mre11 homolog a , double - strand break repair nuclease ( mre11a ) , rad50 double - strand break repair protein ( rad50 ) , and nibrin ( nbn ) , or the mrn complex , is one of the complexes responsible for sensing the double - strand dna damage , activation of atm , and , ultimately , dna repair by hr and nhej26,27 .
our data demonstrate that expression of rad50 was significantly reduced in cells with downregulated cx3cr1 expression ( fig. 5a ) , suggesting that reduction of mrn could be the underlying reason for impaired ddr and reduced clonogenic ability in cx3cr1 - deficient cells .
rad50 mrna expression strongly correlated with the expression of its protein ( fig. 5b ) , suggesting that it is , at least partially , regulated at the transcriptional level .
several molecules , including v - myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog ( mycn ) , myocyte enhancer factor 2c ( mef2c ) , and v - myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog a ( c - myc ; myc ) , were demonstrated to regulate expression of rad50 in different cell types28 - 30 .
we hypothesized that these mechanisms could play a role in cx3cr1 - dependent downregulation of rad50 in ovarian cancer cells .
our studies suggest that mycn , and mef2c are not involved in cx3cr1 - dependent downregulation of rad50 or other proteins of mrn complex ( supplementary results 1 , supplementary figures 6 and 7 ) .
myc was demonstrated to associate with rad50 gene promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation studies28 ; moreover , a previous study indicated high nuclear myc expression in specimens of serous ovarian carcinoma31 .
since our data demonstrated downregulation of rad50 expression in cells with downregulated cx3cr1 expression ( fig. 5a ) , we examined a putative role of myc in cx3cr1 - dependent expression of rad50 .
myc mrna expression correlated with expression of cx3cr1 in specimens of serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma ( fig. 5c ) .
robust downregulation of myc expression was also observed in cells with downregulated cx3cr1 expression ( fig. 5d ) .
expression of rad50 ( both mrna and protein ) strongly correlated with expression of myc in specimens of serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma32,33 ( fig. 5e ) , suggesting that myc is likely to regulate cx3cr1 - dependent reduction of rad50 expression , leading to impairment of both mrn formation and dna damage sensing .
in support , high expression of myc mrna significantly correlated with platinum resistance ( fig. 5f ) and shorter pfs in platinum - and gemcitabine - treated serous ovarian carcinoma patients ( fig. 5g , h ) .
consistent with this , downregulation of myc with specific sirnas alone and in combination with cisplatin treatment resulted in reduction of cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model34. fig. 5 cx3cr1 regulates expression of rad50 and myc in hgsoc cells .
expression of rad50 ( a ) and myc ( d ) in ovcar - 4 transiently transfected with either cx3cr1 - specific ( cx3cr1si ) or control ( ctrlsi ) sirnas or transfected with vehicle ( nt ) was determined using western blot .

images were quantified with digital densitometry using bio - rad chemidoc software , the results of three independent experiments were averaged and plotted .
* p < 0.05 , student 's t test .
correlation between expression of rad50 mrna and protein ( b ) as well as cx3cr1 mrna and myc mrna ( c ) were examined using gene expression data from cbioportal database for serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma ( tcga , provisional , n = 603 ) ; correlation coefficients are indicated on the charts .

red lines - - high myc , black lines - - low myc .
numbers of specimens with high ( red ) and low ( black ) myc for each analyzed group and their corresponding average survival are shown in the tables .
the best performing threshold was used to determine myc - low and myc - high groups of specimens using km plotter software .
expression of myc in examined specimens is plotted as beeswarm plots shown as inserts ; red - - high myc , black - - low myc .
survival was analyzed with mantel - cox log - rank test using km plotter software ; hazard ratios ( hr ) p values are indicated on the graphs downregulation of cx3cr1 synergizes with cisplatin cisplatin is one of the standard of care platinum - based agents used to treat peritoneal metastases from hgsoc .
our data analysis demonstrated that both os and pfs for patients with serous ovarian carcinoma expressing high cx3cr1 is significantly shorter than that for patients with low cx3cr1 ( fig. 1a ) .
hence , we characterized the role of cx3cr1 in chemosensitization to cisplatin .
our data show that transient downregulation of cx3cr1 significantly reduced clonogenic ability of cells subjected to cisplatin and induced moderate , but significant , dna damage in treated cells ( supplementary figure 8a - c ) .
similarly , carboplatin synergized with cx3cr1 downregulation in reducing both cytotoxicity and clonogenic ability ( supplementary figure 8d , e ) .
using effect - based approach and the bliss independence model35 we determined that combination index ( ci ) values were < 1 , indicating that downregulation of cx3cr1 synergized with platinum - based drugs in reducing clone formation of treated cells .
analysis of post - progression survival ( pps ) of platinum - , gemcitabine - , and topotecan - treated patients with serous ovarian carcinoma expressing high cx3cr1 using km plotter database13 showed it was significantly lower compared to that for patients with low cx3cr1 ( supplementary figure 9 ) .
these data indicate that cx3cr1 remained to be one of the determinants of survival and chemotherapy response even after the disease recurred , suggesting that impairment of cx3cr1 could potentially re - sensitize recurrent platinum - resistant disease cases .
transient downregulation of cx3cr1 alone and in a combination with x - ray radiation affects distribution of metastatic lesions at secondary intra - and retro - peritoneal sites in mice because x - ray radiation applied to cells with sirna - downregulated cx3cr1 induced long - term effect on cell proliferation and clone formation , we tested whether these effects could impair the ability of cells to develop intraperitoneal tumors in vivo .
we transiently downregulated cx3cr1 using a pool of specific sirnas in skov - 3 , a model for the deadliest mesenchymal subtype of hgsoc22 , which reproducibly forms peritoneal tumors consistent with the pattern seen in patients .
experimental groups included irradiated cells transfected with cx3cr1 sirnas ( designated " 3 gray cx3cr1si ") , irradiated cells transfected with control sirnas ( designated " 3 gray ctrlsi ") , and unirradiated cells transfected with either cx3cr1 - specific or control sirnas ( designated " 0 gray cx3cr1si " and " 0 gray ctrlsi " , respectively ) ( fig. 6a ) .
consistent with our previous observations and expected pattern of metastatic spread of hgsoc in patients , visible tumors had formed at omentum , peritoneal wall , diaphragm , pancreas , liver , and spleen ( fig. 6b - g ). fig. 6 transient downregulation of cx3cr1 coupled with x - ray radiation affects tumor burden at metastatic sites in the peritoneal cavity .
a a schematic of the experimental setup depicting the sequence of experimental steps : skov - 3 cells were transiently transfected with cx3cr1 - specific sirnas and subjected to 3 gray x - ray on the third day after transfection , cells were collected immediately and injected into the abdomens of athymic nude mice ; tumors were allowed to form for 40 days .
tumors formed on the omentum ( b ) , liver ( c ) , spleen ( d ) , pancreas ( e ) , peritoneal wall and diaphragm ( f ) , as well as the total burden ( g ) , as indicated , were collected , weighed , and weights plotted on the graphs .
the data were statistically analyzed between all groups with one - way anova ; the data between two groups were analyzed using tukey hsd , scheffe , bonferroni and holm , and mann - whitney u tests ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.001 .
the number of animals presenting with metastasis out of total number of experimental animals in each group is shown in red numbers below x - axis irradiation and downregulation of cx3cr1 , either alone or in combination with each other , affected tumor formation at intraperitoneal organs covered by visceral peritoneum as well as at retroperitoneal organs .
both irradiation and cx3cr1 downregulation resulted in significantly reduced tumor burden at omentum ; moreover , a combined action of irradiation and downregulation of cx3cr1 led to significant reduction of tumor burden as well as the number of animals bearing omental metastasis compared to irradiation alone ( fig. 6b ) .
transient downregulation of cx3cr1 alone significantly reduced tumor burden , while irradiation alone almost completely obliterated tumor burden at the liver ( fig. 6c ) .
tumor burden at the spleen was not affected by downregulation of cx3cr1 alone .
however , irradiation alone did significantly reduce spleen tumor burden , while a combination of irradiation and downregulation of cx3cr1 resulted in significantly greater reduction of tumor burden compared to radiation alone ( fig. 6d ) .
irradiation and downregulation of cx3cr1 significantly reduced tumor burden at pancreas , while individually both factors did not have any effect ( fig. 6e ) .
together , these data indicate that transient downregulation of cx3cr1 and x - ray radiation alone as well as their combination affect tumor formation in an organ - specific manner .
transient downregulation of cx3cr1 results in reduction of fatty acid uptake by ovarian carcinoma cells the omentum is the most commonly colonized site by metastasizing ovarian carcinoma cells36,37 .
previous studies have suggested that hgsoc cells use fas from omental adipocytes as energy for growth38 .
gpcrs are known to play a role in fa uptake39 ; however , it is not yet known whether chemokine receptors , including cx3cr1 , are involved in this process .
in our in vivo data , tumor burden at the omentum was significantly reduced by downregulation of cx3cr1 and its combination with radiation .
we posited that regulation of fa uptake may be one of the underlying reasons for reduced tumor burden in groups with reduced cx3cr1 .
thus , we tested a role for cx3cr1 in fa uptake .
we downregulated cx3cr1 using a pool of cx3cr1 - specific sirnas in ovcar - 4 and skov - 3 .
fa uptake was monitored using two approaches : ( 1 ) qbt fa uptake assay , ( 2 ) incubation with linoleic acid , counterstaining with oil red o dye , and fluorescence imaging .
transient downregulation of cx3cr1 led to a significant reduction in fa uptake ( fig. 7a - c ) , suggesting existence of a cx3cr1 - dependent mechanism of lipid uptake. fig. 7 downregulation of cx3cr1 affects fatty acid uptake in serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines .
ovcar - 4 and skov - 3 were transiently transfected with either control ( ctrlsi ) or cx3cr1 - specific ( cx3cr1si ) sirnas and a subjected to qbt fatty acid uptake assay .

d genes , as indicated ( gene b column ) , expression of which strongly correlated with expression of cx3cr1 in specimens from patients , as determined using cbioportal database for serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma ( tcga , nature 2011 dataset ) .
expression of gpr65 ( e ) and ffar4 ( f ) mrna as a function of cx3cr1 mrna expression in specimens of ovarian cystadenocarcinoma was determined using cbioportal database ( left panels : tcga , nature 2011 dataset , n = 557 ; center panels : tcga , provisional dataset , n = 603 ) .
expression of gpr65 and ffar4 in hgsoc cell lines ( shown : skov - 3 ) transiently transfected with either control ( ctrlsi ) or cx3cr1 - specific ( cx3cr1si ) sirnas or transfected with vehicle ( nt ) was determined using western blot ( left panels ) .
actb was used as a loading control .
data ( an average of three experiments ) were analyzed with digital densitometry using bio - rad chemidoc software , averaged , and plotted .
* p < 0.05 , student 's t test we hypothesized that cx3cr1 could regulate expression of one of the proteins playing a role in the processes of fa uptake and metabolism .
to identify possible partners of cx3cr1 in this process , we analyzed co - expression of cx3cr1 and genes related to fa uptake and metabolism in patients with serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma32,33 .
we found that upregulation of cx3cr1 mrna expression significantly co - occurred with upregulation of expression of several genes , including apolipoprotein c2 ( apoc2 ) , atpase phospholipid transporting 8b4 ( atp8b4 ) , bridging integrator 2 ( bin2 ) , free fatty acid receptor 4 ( ffar4 ) , g protein - coupled receptor 65 ( gpr65 ) , macrophage scavenger receptor 1 ( msr1 ) , and oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 ( olr1 ) ( fig. 7d ) , which regulate fa uptake and metabolism40 - 47 .
we further investigated regulation of gpr65 and ffar4 expression by cx3cr1 .
in agreement with data suggesting significant and strong co - expression of cx3cr1 with gpr65 and ffar4 in specimens , western blot confirmed robust downregulation of gpr65 and ffar4 in ovarian carcinoma cell lines transfected with cx3cr1 - specific sirnas ( fig. 7e , f ) .
high expression of both gpr65 and ffar4 significantly correlated with lower survival in patients with serous ovarian carcinoma ( supplementary figure 10 ) .
collectively , these data suggest that expression of genes responsible for fa uptake and metabolism , including gpr65 and ffar4 , is , at least in part , dependent on expression of cx3cr1 .
reduction of cx3cr1 expression leads to reduction in gpr65 and ffar4 expression , which may affect tumor cell 's ability to uptake fas , partially explaining reduced omental metastasis .
discussion our in vivo data indicate that transient downregulation of cx3cr1 either alone or together with x - ray radiation results in a measurable long - term effect , as it affects organ - specific metastatic colonization of the abdomen .
transient downregulation of cx3cr1 significantly reduces formation of lesions at the liver and omentum .
at the same time , formation of lesions at the peritoneal wall , pancreas , and spleen is not affected by transient reduction of cx3cr1 alone , suggesting that neither attachment to mesothelial monolayer , nor cell growth , nor cell migration and invasion are affected , implying the existence of other yet unknown organ - specific mechanisms supporting metastatic dissemination to the liver and omentum that are abrogated upon transient downregulation of cx3cr1 .
our studies can at least partially explain the mechanisms involved in cx3cr1 - dependent reduction of omental metastasis .
our studies indicate that expression of cx3cr1 correlates with that of several proteins responsible for fa uptake , and , thus , might contribute to reduced tumor growth .
however , it remains to be investigated whether cx3cr1 can also participate in direct lipid uptake or regulate other mechanisms leading to reduced omental metastasis .
interestingly , irradiation alone induced opposite effects on organ - specific colonization .
irradiated cells were not capable of forming tumors at the liver , and colonization of the pancreas , spleen , and omentum was partially reduced , suggesting that radiation treatment can affect formation of recurrent tumors in an organ - specific manner .
together , our data demonstrate that dna damage induced by irradiation is significant enough to either completely prevent or reduce tumor formation at visceral and retroperitoneal organs .
irradiation is currently used in palliative care of terminally ill ovarian carcinoma patients ; hence , patients whose metastases are localized to visceral and retroperitoneal sites may potentially draw benefits from irradiation .
moreover , our studies suggest that downregulation of cx3cr1 allows using significantly lower doses of x - ray to achieve the same effects , which may carry a promise of reducing radiation dose and associated toxicities while maintaining the same efficacy in killing tumor cells .
finally , transient downregulation of cx3cr1 together with irradiation brought about the most deleterious effect .
our studies show that dissemination to sites affected by radiation , such as the pancreas , spleen , and omentum , was further negatively affected by cx3cr1 downregulation , suggesting that increased dna damage in cells subjected to both stimuli is the underlying reason for reduced metastatic burden at these sites .
thus , the approach to downregulate cx3cr1 together with administration of a dna damaging agent carries a promise to more effectively kill metastatic cells .
however , this approach has to be extensively evaluated using multiple in vivo models and different cx3cr1 - specific targeting approaches to find the most effective and safest combinations for various patients cohorts .
the major side effect of irradiation in treatment of ovarian cancer is irradiation of normal cells , which could be potentially lethal to the patient .
recent studies demonstrated the efficacy of novel methods of radiation delivery that spare normal tissues from radiation damage .
downregulation of cx3cr1 expression in this setting could allow reducing the radiation dose and associated toxicities while keeping the efficacy of treatment at the same high level .
our in vitro studies provide mechanistic explanation for some of the effects seen in the in vivo studies .
we show that cx3cr1 is instrumental in double - strand dna damage response and repair by regulating expression of rad50 .
building on these mechanistic studies , one of the most important messages taken from these findings is a potential to use cx3cr1 as a target for sensitization to dna damage chemotherapies frequently used to treat ovarian and other solid cancers .
in support , our in vitro studies indicated that cisplatin synergized with downregulation of cx3cr1 to reduce clone formation .
importantly , our data indicate that even transient downregulation of cx3cr1 in combination with other tested therapies brings about measurable dna damage resulting in long - term deleterious effects on tumor growth .
as cx3cr1 is a surface receptor , manipulating mrn expression by targeting cx3cr1 could be a promising approach in the future to increase sensitivity to dna damaging therapies .
hence , it would be important to evaluate combinations of cx3cr1 - targeting agents with cisplatin and other platinum agents in their efficacy against peritoneal metastasis in future studies .
collectively , our data suggest that impairment of cx3cr1 in ovarian carcinoma could be beneficial from multiple standpoints : ( 1 ) it could disrupt fa uptake , further depriving growth of rapidly proliferating metastatic ovarian cancer cells , and , most importantly , ( 2 ) it could increase efficacy of dna damage agents , including x - ray radiation and cisplatin .

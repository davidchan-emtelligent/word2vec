hemodialysis ( hd ) is now an indispensable medical treatment for patients with end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) .
the early establishment of this epoch - making treatment was very difficult .
based on the original concept of blood purification in the 19th century , many great scientists and physicians , such as john j. abel , georg haas , willem kolff , frederik kiil , and belding h. scribner , made tremendous efforts to realize safe and efficient dialysis for patients in the 20th century .
thanks to dr. scribner and many other enthusiastic pioneers , the method of modern hd has been established and spread throughout the world in the 1960s .
since that time , hd - related technology and drugs have greatly evolved in many ways , and it may appear that hd is a completed medical technique which would hardly need any further innovation in the 21st century .
we must take a step back and ask ourselves if hd is truly an established treatment. is there no need for further innovation ? are there no hd - associated clinical problems ?
we believe nearly all nephrologists and hd - devoted physicians and medical staff as well as clinical researchers would answer " no. " even though hd care has greatly progressed , more innovations and further modifications for hd are still necessary to improve the prognosis of hd patients and to prevent various types of complications .
moreover , some refined methods , techniques , and solutions to improve hd might be currently carried out only in limited or localized hospitals and hd facilities in particular areas .
it is easy to imagine that most of these methods are not yet widely known , and they have not been introduced or tried in other hospitals or hd facilities in other countries , particularly in emerging and developing countries where hd was just introduced a mere 5 or 10 years ago and is not spread to every area of each country .
this special issue was planned and proposed to identify the current hd - associated problems which are not well known or not yet resolved .
a number of researchers in clinical practice have indicated various hd - associated problems from diverse perspectives .
such problems include urogenital , cardiac , muscular , and gerontological problems as well as anemia , multiple myeloma , blood access , and also information related to erythropoietin and anticoagulant therapy .
treatment by exercises , a new hemodiafiltration ( hdf ) method , and so on are further included .
all of these newly published findings would not necessarily ensure a perfect resolution for the problems in the hd area or nephrology ; however , we hope that such contributions will lead to useful solutions and novel developments to overcome various insuperable hd - associated problems in the future .
we also expected some innovative reports on ckd - mineral bone disease ( mbd ) , hd session frequency and length , and the use of herbal or alternative medicines , all of which have been very important and still are a matter of controversy .
unfortunately , however , the important findings on these problems could not be published in the current special issue .
we earnestly hope that these problems will be covered and actively discussed in a near future issue of this journal .
acknowledgment the chief guest editor thanks petr boucek , m.d. , ph.d. , for his assistance .

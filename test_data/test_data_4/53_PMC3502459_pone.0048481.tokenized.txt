background renal transplant patients often have severe bone and mineral deficiencies .
while the clinical effects of immunosuppressive agents like calcineurin inhibitors ( cis ) and sirolimus on bone turnover are unclear , bisphosphonates are effective in bone recovery in these patients .
gender is significantly associated with osteoporosis and affects bone turnover , which is different in women and men .
the effective gender - related site of action of bisphosphonates is unknown .
methods initially , we enrolled 84 kidney recipients who had received their transplants at least 5 months ago ; of these , 8 were excluded and 76 were finally included in the study .
first bone mineral density ( bmd ) at the lumbar spine , hip , and femoral neck was determined using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dxa ) between september 2008 and march 2009 .
these 76 patients underwent a repeat procedure after a mean period 14 months .
immunosuppressive agents , bisphosphonates , patients' characteristics , and biochemical factors were analyzed on the basis of the bmd determined using dxa .
results after the 14 - month period , the bmd of lumbar spine increased significantly ( from 0.9 g / cm2 to 0.92 g / cm2 , p < 0.001 ) , whereas that of the hip and femoral neck did not .
ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to show that fosamax improved bone condition , as defined by who ( p = 0.007 ) .
the use of immunosuppressive agents did not affect bone turnover ( p > 0.05 ) .
moreover , in subgroup analysis , fosamax increased the bmd at the lumbar spine and the hipbone in males ( p = 0.028 and 0.03 , respectively ) but only at the lumbar spine in females ( p = 0.022 ) .
conclusion after a long periods after renal transplantation , the detrimental effects of steroid and immunosuppressive agents on bone condition diminished .
short - term fosamax administration effectively improves bmd in these patients .
the efficacy of fosamax differed between male and female renal transplant patients .
the authors have no support or funding to report .
introduction patients maintained on dialysis for end - stage renal disease exhibit severe mineral and bone deficiencies .
while renal transplantation restores defective kidney function in patients with chronic renal disease , the associated steroid and other immunosuppressive therapies continuously damage the bones [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] ; the expected correction of established bone lesions does not occur .
although transplantation can resolve many biochemical imbalances , such as hyperparathyroidism , associated with chronic renal failure , progressive loss of bmd in the trabecular bone often occurs early after renal transplantation [ 3 ] .
investigators have not agreed on the risk factors that are most strongly associated with reduced bmd [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] after renal transplantation , except on an accumulated dose of steroid .
at present , the use of biochemical markers of bone turnover in the serum or urine is not recommended for diagnosis [ 6 ] .
the world health organization ( who ) defines osteoporosis as a condition in which the difference between the mean bmds for the lumbar spine ( ls ) , femoral neck ( fn ) , or hip ( h ) of the patients and healthy young adults is more than 2.5 standard deviations ( sds ) , as measured by dual energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dxa ) .
further , osteopenia is defined as a condition in which the difference between the mean bmds of the patients and healthy young adults is between 1 and 2.5 sds [ 6 ] .
several studies have shown the beneficial effects of bisphosphonates on post - transplantation osteoporosis [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
other studies have shown that calcineurin inhibitors ( cis ) have deleterious effects on bone mineral metabolism in rats [ 10 ] - [ 12 ] , and that at least one cyclosporine has a protective effect on bone [ 13 ] .
other immune - modifying drugs , such as azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , and sirolimus , which are used in conjunction with glucocorticoids and cis , have not been shown to promote bone loss , neither experimentally nor clinically [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
osteoporosis caused by portosystemic shunting [ 16 ] , or by steroid or cis through receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa - b ligand ( rankl ) - dependent pathways , may be partially ameliorated using sirolimus [ 17 ] .
moreover , the physiology of bone turnover differs according to gender , particularly in menopausal women [ 18 ] - [ 21 ] , and the efficacy of alendronate in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis has been well established [ 22 ] .
to our knowledge , the gender - related efficacy of alendronate in renal transplant subjects has rarely been reported .
the aim of this randomized case - control study was to assess the impact of immunosuppressive agents and alendronate on bmd , as estimated by dxa , and to determine whether the response to alendronate in renal transplant subjects is gender - dependent .
materials and methods this case - control study complied with the guidelines of the declaration of helsinki and approved by the medical ethics committee of chang gung memorial hospital , a tertiary referral center located in the northern part of taiwan .
since this study involved retrospective review of existing data , the institutional review board approval was obtained , but without specific informed consent from patients .
in addition , all individual information was securely protected ( by delinking identifying information from main data set ) and available to investigators only .
furthermore , all the data were analyzed anonymously .
on the other hand , if this study involved retrospective review of existing data plus retrospective analysis of remaining biological samples , both institutional review board approval and specific informed consent must be obtained from all patients .
the institutional review board of chang gung memorial hospital has specifically waived the need for consent .
finally , all primary data were collected according to strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology guidelines .
the form described above was referenced from the liu et al. ' s publication [ 23 ] .
study population we randomly enrolled 84 kidney recipients ( 40 men and 44 women ) who had undergone transplantation at least 5 months ago .
we used dxa to obtain bmd measurements of the lumbar spine ( ls ) , left hip ( h ) , and femoral neck ( fn ) between september 2008 and march 2009 [ 24 ] .
bone condition was defined on the basis of the who criteria : a bmd value > 2.5 standard deviations ( sd , t score ) below the young adult mean indicated osteoporosis and that between 1.0 and 2.5 sds below the mean indicated osteopenia .
the immunosuppressive agents that the patients had received included prednisolone ( 5 mg / tablet ) , cyclosporine ( 25 mg / tablet and 100 mg / tablet ) , tacrolimus ( 0.5 mg / tablet and 1 mg / tablet ) , sirolimus ( 1 mg / tablet ) , and mycophenolate ( 250 mg / tablet ) .
fosamax ( alendronate sodium ; 70 mg / tablet , 70 mg per week ) was administered to the patients who were initially diagnosed with osteoporosis .
fasting blood levels of serum creatinine ( cr ) , blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) , calcium , inorganic phosphate , and uric acid were obtained .
the patients' medical records were studied for the history of diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , smoking frequency , alcohol intake , and hepatitis b ( hbv ) , hepatitis c ( hcv ) , and cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) infections .
all the doses of immunosuppressive agents administered between the 2 bmd measurements were considered as the accumulated dose .
after 14 +/ - 1.6 months of follow - up , the 76 remaining patients ( 8 of the 84 patients were excluded - - 2 subjects had died , 2 had graft failure , and the initial bmd measurements of 4 patients was lost ) received a second measurement of bmd and fasting blood tests .
precautions and contraindications for the use of fosamax the first dxa report was obtained between september 2008 and march 2009 .
fosamax ( 70 mg per week ) was administered to the patients diagnosed with osteoporosis based on this dxa report unless 1 or more of the following conditions was present : bisphosphonate allergy ; blood calcium levels < 8 mg / dl ; active stomach problems ( e.g. , esophagitis , gastritis , or ulcers ) ; renal insufficiency ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ egfr ] < 30 ml /[ min.1.73 m2 ] or serum cr level > 3 mg / dl ) ; difficulty swallowing or the inability to stand / sit upright for at least 30 min , and pregnancy and breastfeeding .
the patients did not receive fosamax prior to obtainment of the first dxa data .
furthermore , the patients were informed that they should take the drug only upon rising for the day with 3 to 4 swallows of water and that they should stand , walk , or sit and fast for 30 - 45 min afterwards , and then eat breakfast .
lying down or reclining after taking the drug is prohibited .
at least 30 min should pass after the intake of alendronate before taking supplements or other drugs .
immunosuppressive protocol in our hospital , we mainly use a ci - based immunosuppressive regimen in the initial months of transplantation .
most of our patients also receive mycophenolic acid plus prednisolone during this stage .
immediately after transplantation , the targeted cyclosporine concentration at 2 h post - dose ( c2 ) is approximately 1300 - 1100 ng / ml and the tacrolimus trough level is maintained at approximately 12 - 10 ng / ml. these concentrations are tapered gradually in the first year .
in patients that have been transplanted for more than 12 months , the cyclosporine c2 level is maintained at approximately 500 - 600 ng / ml and tacrolimus level at 3 - 4 ng / ml. prednisolone is maintained at 1.25 - 10 mg per day , according to patient 's condition .
an mtor inhibitor is added to the regimen if the patient 's condition is suitable ( proteinuria < 800 mg / day and egfr > 40 ml /[ min.1.73 m2 ]) .
the trough level of the mtor inhibitor is maintained at approximately 3 - 8 ng / ml. once the mtor inhibitor has been added , the ci and mycophenolic acid dose are cut by 50 % overnight , while prednisolone is maintained at the same dosage .
subsequently , the ci dose is tapered as much as possible .
most of the patients in this study received only 25 mg cyclosporine or 0.5 mg tacrolimus per day if an mtor inhibitor was used .
statistical analysis the data , given as median and interquartile ranges in non - normal distribution variables , are expressed as mean +/ - sd in normal distribution variables .
the paired t test and the wilcoxon signed - rank test were used to compare data of the patients at presentation and follow - up. the kruskal - wallis test and one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) were performed to compare data of the different bone conditions defined by the who criteria .
comparisons among groups were performed using the mann - whitney test and student 's t test .
we used multivariate ordinal logistic regression to test the expected value between clinical variables and the change of bone condition ( grade 1 : change to better , grade 2 : no change , and grade 3 : deterioration ; change to better : from osteoporosis to osteopenia or normal , or from osteopenia to normal ; no change : no change in bone condition at start and follow - up ; deterioration : from normal to osteopenia or osteoporosis , or from osteopenia to osteoporosis ) , as defined by who .
the chi - square test was used to determine the correlation between the 2 binary variables ; a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
all statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) version 12.0 for windows ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
results characteristics of the study population after a follow - up period of 14 +/ - 1.6 months , 76 subjects received a second bmd measurement .
among these patients , 12 had a medical history of dm ; 10 were infected with hbv , 15 with hcv , and 13 with cmv ; 10 men were habitual tobacco users , and 8 men and 1 woman regularly consumed alcohol .
thirty - four patients received fosamax , 57 , prednisolone ; 55 , mycohenolate ; 30 , tacrolimus ; 26 , cyclosporine ; and 34 , sirolimus .
eight patients ( 11 %) received a single immunosuppressive agent , 21 patients ( 28 %) received 2 immunosuppressive agents , 36 ( 47 %) received 3 , and 11 ( 14 %) received 4 .
bone mineral density ( bmd ) at baseline and at follow - up table 1 shows the changes in bmd and blood biochemistry after 14 +/ - 1.6 months of follow - up. in the 76 patients , calcium level decreased from 9.45 +/ - 0.51 mg / dl to 9.29 +/ - 0.52 mg / dl ( p < 0.001 ) and albumin from 4.42 +/ - 0.29 g / l to 4.34 +/ - 0.4 g / l ( p = 0.009 ) , both levels were still within the normal range .
however , bmd of the lumbar spine increased from 0.9 to 0.92 g / cm2 , ( p < 0.001 ) .
no correlation between the use of fosamax and that of the immunosuppressive agents could be demonstrated , as determined by the chi - square test ( p > 0.05 ) .
no patient who received fosamax exhibited a deterioration in the condition of his bone structure , as defined by who criteria .
thirty patients showed no change in their bone condition , but 4 showed improvement .
in patients who had not received fosamax , 6 ( 14 %) showed deterioration and 1 ( 2 %) showed improvement .

bmd in patients with osteoporosis and without in 41 patients with and 35 without osteoporosis at baseline , the lumbar spine bone density increased ( from 0.83 to 0.86 g / cm2 [ p < 0.001 ] and from 0.99 to 1.0 g / cm2 [ p = 0.02 ] ; respectively ) after the mean 14 - month follow - up period , but hip and femoral neck densities did not ( table 2 ) .
in order to detect any difference in bmd due to the use of immunosuppressive agents in different conditions of the bone , the patients were divided into 3 groups : normal , osteopenia , and osteoporosis , on the basis of the initial dxa findings .
the osteoporosis group received a greater cumulative steroid dose than the osteopenia group ( 1326.5 mg vs. 724.5 mg ; p = 0.005 ; figure 1a ) , and the increase in the lumbar spine bmd was greater in the osteoporosis group ( 0.033 g / cm2 vs. 0.009 g / cm2 ; p = 0.028 ; figure 1b ) .
otherwise , the cumulative dose of immunosuppressive agents among the 3 groups did not differ significantly ( p > 0.05 ; figure 1a ) .
interestingly , of our 41 osteoporosis patients , 7 did not receive fosamax due to their intolerance of the side effects .
among those 41 patients , those administered fosamax showed a greater increase in bmd ( 0.035 g / cm2 vs. 0.003 g / cm2 ) but not significant ( p > 0.05 ) .

factors associated with bone turnover to deepen our investigation of the influence of clinical features on bone condition , we used a univariate binary logistic regression to evaluate the association between bone condition ( osteoporotic and not osteoporotic at follow - up ) and the clinical variables in 76 patients .
the use of both prednisolone ( odds ratio [ or ] , 5.18 ; 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.6 - 16.4 ; p = 0.005 ) and fosamax ( or , 18.75 ; 95 % ci , 5.42 - 64.76 ; p < 0.001 ) showed an association in patients with osteoporosis ( figure 2a ) .
in an ordinal logistic regression with multivariate analysis of the change in bone condition ( grade 1 , improvement ; grade 2 , no change ; and grade 3 , deterioration ; as defined by who criteria ) and the clinical variables , after adjusting for age , sex , status of diabetes , smoking , alcohol consumption , time since transplantation , age at transplant , and use of prednisolone , the use of fosamax ( or , - 3.115 ; 95 % ci , - 5.364 ; - 0.866 ; p = 0.007 ) was found to be associated with a positive prognosis ( figure 2b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0048481.g002 figure 2 clinical variables associated with bone condition change .
a binary ( non - osteoporosis and osteoporosis in follow - up ) logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with osteoporosis .
the dependent variable was non - osteoporosis or osteoporosis .
the independent variables were age , sex , dm , smoking , alcohol consumption , age at transplantation , time since transplant , use of immunosuppressive agents and use of fosamax .
both the use of prednisolone ( odds ratio [ or ] , 5.18 ; 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.6 - 16.4 ; p = 0.005 ) and the use of fosamax ( or , 18.75 ; 95 % ci , 5.42 - 64.76 ; p < 0.001 ) were associated with the symptoms of osteoporosis ( figure 2a ) .
in an ordinal logistic regression with multivariate analysis of the change of bone condition ( grade 1 , changed to the better ; grade 2 , no change ; and grade 3 , deterioration , as defined by who criteria and clinical variables ) , after adjusting for age , sex , status of diabetes ( dm ) , smoking , alcohol consumption , time since transplant , age at transplant , and use of prednisolone , the use of fosamax ( or , - 3.115 ; 95 % ci , - 5.364 to - 0.866 ; p = 0.007 ) was found to be associated with a positive prognosis ( figure 2b ) .
gender differences in the effect of fosamax on bones in our study , we found no gender - related differences in bone turnover of renal transplant patients during the mean 14 - month follow - up period .
seeking a gender - related difference in the physiology of bone turnover , we examined the bone response to fosamax in the 2 sexes .
we found no differences in bone turnover with respect to age , time since transplant , or the changes in blood values for creatinine , albumin , or calcium , and neither was the change in bmd or the cumulative immunosuppressive agents different in the 2 sexes .
however , when we compared bmd before and after fosamax treatment within the male and female groups , we found fosamax to be more effective in men than in women .
among the patients who received fosamax , bmd in the lumbar spine and the hip ( p = 0.028 and p = 0.03 , respectively ) increased in 14 men ; however , the increase in the bmd was observed only in the lumbar spine ( p = 0.022 ; table 3 ) in 20 women .
among the above - mentioned men and women who used fosamax , the bmd difference values were not different ( p > 0.05 ) .
thus , we find that the sites of action of fosamax differ across the 2 sexes .

discussion in this study , we have shown that short - term weekly use of fosamax can improve both bmd and bone condition , in accordance with the who criteria , regardless of effect of immunosuppressive agents after a long period after renal transplantation .
in renal transplant subjects with osteoporosis , fosamax improved the bmd of the lumbar spine .
although the bone condition after renal transplantation did not vary according to gender , the bone regions in which fosamax was effective did vary .
an increase in bone mass loss is multifactorial and is affected by age [ 21 ] , sex [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] , renal function , and duration of time for which the patient was on dialysis before transplantation [ 20 ] .
a major influencing and well - known factor causing increased loss of bone mass is high - dose steroid therapy during the early period after transplantation and continuous long - term steroid administration [ 2 ] .
cis such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus also are known to have serious effects and cause rapid and severe bone losses in both animal models and humans .
the role of t - lymphocyte action via rankl seems to be of essence in triggering bone loss [ 14 ] .
other immune - modifying drugs such as azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , and sirolimus , which are used in conjunction with glucocorticoids and cis , have - - neither experimentally nor clinically - - been shown to promote bone loss .
recent studies [ 17 ] , [ 25 ] suggest that sirolimus could promote an osteoclastic balance between the effects of steroid and of calcineurine inhibitors .
moreover , under sirolimus - based maintenance immunosuppression [ 26 ] after bone surgery , no radiologic advantage or disadvantage to bone healing was noted .
therefore , in our clinical estimation , a bias may exist between the biochemical markers and dxa - who criteria in osteoporosis to evaluate bone condition .
interestingly , the lumbar spine bmd in our 35 non - osteoporotic patients increased slightly .
as was true with the steroids , the cumulative dose of immunosuppressive agents in the non - osteoporosis and osteoporosis groups did not differ .
in the past decade , the use of corticosteroids in the peritransplantation period has been dramatically reduced and replaced by cis and other adjunctive agents .
to our knowledge , the first 3 to 6 months after transplantation is the critical period for the loss in bone mass [ 4 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
in a long - term study , the ongoing accelerated lumbar bone mass loss was 1.7 +/ - 2.8 % per year [ 29 ] , but in the 12 months following cardiac transplantation , the ls bmd value was restored to that at the time of transplant [ 30 ] .
twenty - four months after transplantation , the yearly loss of absolute bmd was parallel to the age - dependent physiological decline in absolute bmd [ 5 ] .
in our study , the time since transplant of non - osteoporotic subjects was 78 +/ - 60 months. from the studies cited above and from our observations during the long post - transplantation period , we can explain the slightly increased bmd of lumbar spine in our patients who did not receive fosamax .
otherwise , as the use of immunosuppressive agents changes in the long period of renal transplantation , the effective power of steroid on bone turnover may be increasingly minor .
in this study , when we analyzed the subgroups of the subjects with osteoporosis , we observed that fosamax was not equally effective in men and women in the different bone regions .
several previous studies have shown that bisphosphonates continued to improved bone mineral density after renal transplantation [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] and most of them showed the effect on both lumbar spine and femoral neck bmd .
in a meta - analysis review of 1209 patients [ 33 ] , treatment with bisphosphonates increased bmd in lumbar spine and femoral neck .
no measurable change in the bmd of the hip area was observed .
in another population - based longitudinal study [ 18 ] , both the bone turnover and the sites of bone loss differed according to gender .
in a 2 - year double - blind trial of men with osteoporosis ( mean age , 63 years ) , alendronate significantly increased bone mass of spine and hipbone and helped prevent vertebral fractures [ 34 ] .
iwamoto et al .
[ 35 ] have suggested that although alendronate treatment in men effectively increased lumbar bmd from baseline , its efficacy appeared to be no greater than that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis .
studies on the comparative effects in a renal transplant population of bisphosphonates according to gender and bone site are limited .
in our study on men and women who presented no significant differences in the increase in their bmd with fosamax , the 14 osteoporotic men showed improved bmd at the hip and lumbar spine and the 20 osteoporotic females responded well only at the lumbar spine .
fosamax is absorbed and partitioned rapidly , with approximately 50 % binding to the exposed bone surface and the remainder being excreted unchanged by the kidneys [ 36 ] .
therefore , fosamax should be used carefully in patients with renal insufficiency or in anuric patients because of concerns regarding drug accumulation .
the major side effect of fosamax is ulceration of the esophagus , which may require hospitalization and intensive treatment .
gastric and duodenal ulceration may also occur [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
the co - administration of fosamax and calcium , antacids , or oral medications containing multivalent cations interferes with the absorption of alendronate [ 38 ] .
the short - term use of a low dose of fosamax ( 40 mg per week ) was safe in hemodialysis patients [ 39 ] .
alendronate treatment safely and effectively increased bmd and decreased fractures in women with normal to severely impaired renal function [ 40 ] , and no differences in adverse events were observed in these women according to their renal function .
the use of fosamax for a mean of 14 months did not deteriorate renal function in male and female renal transplant patients ( table 3 ) .
to our knowledge , studies on the interaction between fosamax and immunosuppressant agents are limited .
the studies cited above and our own observations suggest that the interaction between these agents is subtle .
although the limitations of our study with regard to its retrospective design and small sample size are evident , to our knowledge , these are the first data reporting the differences between men and women with regard to the sites at which fosamax is effective in renal transplant patients ; these findings refer to short - term treatment after a long post - renal transplantation period .
conclusions in conclusion , this randomized case - control study has shown that short - term use of fosamax increased bmd and that the effect of concomitant steroid was not significantly correlated with bone turnover .
moreover , fosamax increased the bmd of the lumbar spine and hip significantly in men , but only in the lumbar spine in women .
immunosuppressive agents such as cis , sirolimus , and mycohenolate were not correlated with any change in bmd .
we thank the members of the immune transplant center in chang gung memorial hospital for their invaluable and dedicated assistance .

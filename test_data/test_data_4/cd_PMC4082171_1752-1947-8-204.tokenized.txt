introduction " molly " is a street name for pure 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , an amphetamine derivative which acts by enhancing the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin , dopamine and norepinephrine .
this produces euphoria , increased sensory awareness and central stimulation that make it a popular club drug .
nevertheless , it is also associated with serious side effects .
we report an unusual case of rapid multiorgan failure after ingestion of " molly " .
unlike previously described patterns of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine - related organ failure , our case does not appear to be related to hyperthermia , rhabdomyolysis or hyponatremia .
case presentation a 24 - year - old hispanic man presented to our hospital with an episode of seizure and subsequently developed acute kidney injury , respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and congestive heart failure after ingestion of " molly " .
he rapidly recovered with supportive care and was discharged home .
conclusions the spectrum of complications associated with 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine is wide and patient presentation may vary .
moreover , there appears to be multiple mechanisms involved in organ failure .
drug toxicity should be suspected while evaluating a patient with multisystem organ failure of unclear etiology .
treatment is generally supportive sometimes requiring mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis .
nevertheless , complete reversal of organ failure can be expected .
mdma " molly " multiorgan failure introduction " molly " is a new club drug gaining popularity in the last decade in all - night dance events and music festivals .
the name " molly " is derived from the term " molecule " and is supposedly the pure form of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( mdma ) which was previously popular as " ecstasy " .
it is usually distributed as a capsule containing the crystalline powder form of mdma ; it has stimulant and hallucinogenic properties resulting in mood enhancement and euphoria .
" molly " is perceived to be safer than ecstasy because it lacks adulterants , and like ecstasy has limited addictive potential [ 1,2 ] .
it is now clear that there is significant morbidity associated with this drug including several reported cases of death .
we report a case of rapidly reversible multiorgan failure after ingestion of " molly " .
case presentation a 24 - year - old hispanic man presented after a witnessed tonic - clonic seizure with urinary incontinence that resolved after lorazepam administration .
he had a remote history of seizures but was not on any medications .
he was postictal , afebrile and tachycardic with a pulse of 124 beats per minute ( bpm ) and blood pressure ( bp ) of 144 / 66mmhg .
initial laboratory was remarkable for a lactate of 17mmoles / l , which resolved rapidly .
a routine urine toxicology screen was positive for cannabinoids and benzodiazepines and negative for cocaine , phencyclidine , opiates and amphetamines .
the next day he complained of abdominal pain , diarrhea , vomiting and developed progressive agitation and confusion .
his lipase level was normal ; however , his serum creatinine had increased from 1.4 to 4.3g / dl and subsequently increased further ( table 1 ) .
within a few hours his respiratory distress worsened , becoming hypoxic with an arterial saturation of 70 % .
also noted were a fever of 38.89degreesc ( 102degreesf ) , heart rate of 140bpm , and bp of 163 / 104mmhg .
after failing a trial of non - invasive ventilation , he was intubated .
a chest x - ray revealed bilateral infiltrates ( figure 1 ) .
he remained hypoxemic after intubation requiring 100 % fraction of inspired oxygen .
despite not meeting compliance criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome his oxygenation responded to high positive end - expiratory pressure .
antibiotics were initiated for possible pneumonia .
bronchoscopy revealed normal airways and clear secretions , not compatible with aspiration or bacterial pneumonia .
bronchoalveolar lavage was performed .
subsequently , an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 30 % with wall motion abnormalities .
bronchoscopy and echocardiogram findings suggested the etiology of hypoxemic respiratory failure was most likely fluid overload .
the etiology for acute kidney injury ( aki ) and congestive heart failure ( chf ) was unclear .
after three sessions of hemodialysis , his oxygenation , urine output , and creatinine levels improved .
he was extubated on hospital day eight allowing further history .
apparently several hours prior to symptom onset he had consumed the street drug " molly " with alcohol , marijuana , and " purple drank " , a slang term for a drink containing codeine and promethazine .
no further hemodialysis was required and a repeat echocardiogram demonstrated normalization of his left ventricular function .
he was discharged home on day twelve of hospitalization .

discussion in summary , our patient was a young man presenting with a seizure and subsequent multiorgan failure .
several hypotheses were considered to explain his presentation including aspiration pneumonitis , severe sepsis , neuroleptic malignant syndrome , rhabdomyolysis leading to aki and collagen vascular disease with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage .
there was no clear source of infection and all cultures including bronchoalveolar lavage were negative .
although he did receive one dose of haloperidol intravenously for his agitation on day 1 , neuroleptic malignant syndrome was unlikely as he was only briefly febrile , there was no rigidity and creatine kinase levels were only mildly elevated .
collagen vascular disease seemed unlikely , as all his serologic markers were negative. of interest , he had a complete and rapid recovery with just supportive treatment .
this presentation could be explained by drug toxicity .
the initial drug screen was negative for amphetamines .
however , this was performed by routine immunoassay , which has a low sensitivity for detecting mdma .
severity of patient presentation is not necessarily related to the ingested dose of mdma [ 3,4 ] .
our patient admitted taking multiple drugs along with " molly " .
however , it is unlikely that the other substances ingested concomitantly with " molly " in our patient would have contributed to a rapid onset multisystem organ failure .
mdma toxicity is due to release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine causing hyperthermia , seizures and muscle breakdown leading to renal failure [ 1,2 ] .
cardiac toxicity can lead to chf , arrhythmias and myocardial infarction .
the mechanism of cardiac toxicity is not clearly understood but can be related to oxidative stress from toxic metabolites of mdma [ 5,6 ] .
in addition , other toxic effects include hyponatremia , disseminated intravascular coagulation , liver failure and cerebrovascular accidents [ 7,8 ] .
the development of hyponatremia is multifactorial and is thought to be primarily due to drug - induced excessive thirst and secretion of arginine vasopressin in the setting of fluid availability [ 6 ] .
various constellations of these manifestations have resulted in case reports of multisystem organ failure .
several mechanisms of aki associated with mdma have been proposed with the most common etiology being seizure - precipitated rhabdomyolysis potentially accentuated by volume depletion and hypotension .
these cases have pronounced levels of creatine kinase [ 6 ] .
in our patient the cause of renal failure was not clear given only mildly elevated creatine kinase levels .
as shown in table 1 , a creatine kinase level of 863 units / l was the highest level recorded during his entire hospitalization .
retrospectively , he most probably developed drug - induced renal artery vasoconstriction leading to renal hypoperfusion and reversible acute tubular necrosis .
severe symptomatic hyponatremia is another serious complication of mdma that can present with mental status changes and seizures .
although our patient presented with a seizure , it did not appear to be related to hyponatremia nor to hyperthermia .
his confusion and agitation prior to intubation could be interpreted as drug withdrawal but was more probably attributable to encephalopathy in the setting of aki and hypoxemia .
acute respiratory failure in the context of multisystem failure is due to acute lung injury in most cases discussed in the literature [ 9 ] .
in our patient this appeared more related to fluid overload as a consequence of chf and aki .
based on a review of case reports , liechti et al. described two common presentations of ecstasy - related death : the first being multiorgan failure precipitated by hyperthermia and the second , hyponatremia - induced brain edema [ 10 ] .
our patient had only a transient fever spike with minimally decreased sodium ; he does not appear to fit into either of these categories .
contrary to the belief that " molly " is pure mdma , it is often adulterated with so - called designer drugs , for example methylenedioxypyrovalerone also known as bath salts .
these compounds inhibit norepinephrine - dopamine reuptake and have a side - effect profile similar to mdma including aki [ 11 ] .
it is possible that our patient unknowingly ingested bath salts with " molly " .
conclusions physicians evaluating patients with increased sympathetic activity and multisystem failure should consider drug intoxication in the differential especially when other etiologies become less likely .
rapid and complete reversal of multisystem failure with supportive treatment only is suggestive of drug intoxication .
often , as in our case , a full history has to be elicited retrospectively .
therefore when drug intoxication is considered a full toxicology screen including mdma levels should be obtained .
routine immunoassays for detecting amphetamines are unreliable in detecting mdma and more specific screening tests should be requested .
in patients with " molly " - induced organ failure it is difficult to predict which organs may fail [ 12 ] .
pathophysiology and severity of organ failure may vary .
" molly " is abused in our community .
sadly , young people who consume a single dose are at risk of serious side effects because , unlike other drugs , the toxicity of mdma is not necessarily dose related [ 12 ] .
in addition , unknowing consumption of harmful adulterants may also occur .
" molly " may be used in conjunction with other recreational drugs with their own unique toxicities [ 13 ] .
increased awareness of the dangers of " molly " is needed among the youth of our community .

background type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2d ) is a metabolic disease characterized by dysfunction of pancreatic beta cell and insulin resistance .
liraglutide , which has many special anti - diabetes biological effects , is found to inhibit beta cell death and ameliorate endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ers ) induced by free fatty acid ( ffa ) .
macroautophagy ( hereafter referred to as autophagy ) altered by ffa is also associated with the dysfunction or death of pancreatic beta cells .
objectives we aim at proving that liraglutide improves the survival of ins - 1 cells by promoting autophagy .
materials and methods cell survival was assessed by cck8 assay .
the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometric assay after annexin v - fitc / pi staining .
expression of lc3 was detected by western blotting .
mdc staining and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) were used in the measurement of autophagy .
results apoptosis induced by pa in ins - 1 cells was significantly resolved after liraglutide treatment .
simultaneously , autophagy was enhanced with the treatment of pa and liraglutide .
conclusions : liraglutide appears to protect ins - 1 cells from apoptosis ffa - induced by promoting autophagy .
conclusions these findings provide a novel role for glp - 1 analogue in preventing or treating with t2d .
liraglutide autophagy type 2 diabetes free fatty acid ins - 1cells 1 .
background type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2d ) , as a metabolic disease , is characterized by dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells and insulin resistance .
in recent decades , with the increasing prevalence of t2d , western diets which compose of both saturated fatty acids ( ffas ) and trans - saturated fatty acid have been decided as the environmental factors contributed to the pathogenesis of diabetes .
glucolipotoxicity has been regarded as the key point contributed to the increasing beta cell apoptosis rates and progressive beta cell loss in t2d ( 1 ) .
thus , we focus on the development of ways to protect beta cell from apoptosis induced by ffa and the treatment strategies improving beta cells function .
glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) , an incretin released from the l - cells of the small intestine , targets pancreatic beta cells to release insulin and reduce glucagons production in response to food intake ( 2 ) .
in addition , glp - 1 also possesses some special anti - diabetes biological effects , such as anti - apoptosis , improving cell proliferation and differentiation ( 3 - 5 ) .
liraglutide is a human glp - 1 analog with 97 % amino acid homology to native human glp - 1 ( 6 ) , and its protective actions against diabetes are mediated at the level of the beta cell , as well as in peripheral tissues .
treating with liraglutide subsequently after american lifestyle - induced obesity syndrome ( alios ) diet shows a marked reduction in the lipid load in hepatocytes ( 7 ) .
it is found that hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance caused by high fat diet suppress autophagy .
the mechanism of ffa - mediated autophagy is still unclear .
researches demonstrated that high insulin production induced by elevated ffa in beta cells overwhelmed endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) folding capacity and unfolded protein response ( upr ) , which finally resulted in endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ers ) .
autophagy , acting as a degradation system , may be responsible for removing the overload of unfolded or misfolded protein that exceeds the er capacity and contributes to the ameliorate of ers .
the er - selective upr induces reticulophagy , which may serve to reduce the volume of er and unfolded er proteins ( 8 ) .
singh et al. recently demonstrated that a fatty acid load in mouse hepatocytes is reduced by macroautophagy ( 9 ) .
2. objectives investigations have explored the role of glp - 1 in ffa - induced pancreatic beta cell death that the survivability is improved by stimulating glp - 1 receptor ( 10 - 12 ) ; however it is still unknown whether glp - 1 reduces beta cells death by regulating macroautophagy.in this study , we will investigate the macroautophagy induced by ffa in ins - 1 cells in the presence and absence ofliraglutide .
the results will provide a novel role for glp - 1 analogue in preventing or treating of t2d by confirming the role of glp - 1 on mediating autophagy in beta cells .

liraglutide enhances survivability in ins - 1 cells we incubated ins - 1 cells with 0.5 mmol l - 1 pa in the presence of 5 mmol l - 1 glucose for 24h .
the viability of ins - 1 cells was reduced dramatically with the treatment of pa by cck8 assay .
as shown in figure 1 , the ins - 1 cells viability was significantly decreased to 55 % in pa group compared with the control group ( figure 1 ) .
ins - 1 cells were then treated and engorged with liraglutide to determine if liraglutide protected ins - 1 cells from death .
the survival of ins - 1 cell with pa was improved to 85 % after treating with liraglutide100 nmol l - 1 for 24h ( figure 1 ) .
the results suggested that lireglutide protects ins - 1 cells from death induced by pa. as a classiii pi3k inhibitor , 3 - ma significantly reduced ins - 1 cells viability to 54 % and 40 % by treating with 3 - ma alone and 3 - ma plus with pa ( figure 1 ) .
liraglutide improved the viability to 73 % and 64 % respectively , the percentage of which is lower than that of adding liraglutide without pre - treated with 3 - ma ( figure 1 ) .
the results demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy decreased ins - 1 cells viability , and this effect could be strengthened by pa. figure 1 .

liraglutide inhibits ffa - induced apoptosis in ins - 1 cells an annexin v - fitc / pi quantification assay demonstrated that pa - induced ins - 1 cells were mediated by apoptosis .
in our study , the apoptosis of ins - 1 cells increased to 19 % induced by pa compared with 5 % in control group ( figure 2b ) .
in addition , as shown in figure 2d , apoptosis proportion was reduced to 13 % suggesting a protective role of liraglutide in ins - 1 cells form pa - induced apoptosis .
autophagy inhibitor , 3 - ma , produced an increased apoptosis to 10 % in 3 - ma group ( figure 2e ) and 26 % in pa + 3 - ma group ( figure 2f ) .
figure 2 .
liraglutide inhibits ffa - induced apoptosis in ins - 1 cells .
ins - 1 cells were pre - treated with liraglutide ( 100 nmol l - 1 ) for 24h , then exposed to palmitate ( pa , 0.5 mmol l - 1 ) for 24h .

liraglutide inhibits pa - induced apoptosis by stimulating autophagy when mdc , an autofluorescent compound used for the in vivo labeling of autophagic vacuoles , was applied to pa - treated ins - 1 cells with liraglutide , the proportion of cells with mdc stained dots was dramatically increased ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 .
liraglutide induced autophgy in ins - 1 cells loaded with pa. the ins - 1 cells treated with 0.5 mmol l - 1 pa for indicated time durations were stained with 50 um mdc for 10 min .
the fluorescent dots were observed under a fluorescence microscope .
( a ) control ; ( b ) palmitate 0.5 mmol l - 1 ; ( c ) liraglutide 100 nmol l - 1 ; ( d ) palmitate 0.5 mmol l - 1 and liraglutide 100 nmol l - 1 . there was also an obvious increase of mdc stained dots in ins - 1 cells following pa treatment alone for 24h , but relatively intact cellular structures could only be seen with liraglutide treatment .
no obviously increased mdc stained dots were showed in cells in the presence of liraglutide alone .
the results suggested that liraglutide induced autophagy in ins - 1 cells loaded with pa , and the induced autophagy was necessary to maintain the structure , mass and function of ins - 1 cells .
a typical autophagosome , double - limiting membrane , was detectable in the autophagosome ( black arrowheads ) and autophagolysosome ( white arrowheads ) ( figure 4a ( a )) examined by em. ultrastructural images analysis showed the presence of double - membrane autophagic vesicles containing cell organelles in the cytoplasm of ins - 1 cells .
there was an increased number of autophagic vacuoles ( av ) , including autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes ( al ) , and also swelling mitochondrias in pa - treated ins - 1 cells with liraglutide .
( figure 4a ( b )) .
as lc3b - iiis the key protein associated with macrozutophagy , the conversion of lc3 - ito lc3b - iiwas examined .

5. discussion direct deleterious effects of ffas on beta cells are collectively termed " lipotoxicity "( 17 ) .
pa elicited ins - 1 cells death mainly through apoptosis .
results in our study showed decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in ins - 1 cells induced by pa coincidence with previous study of sung - e choi 's ( 16 ) .
an improved ins - 1 cells survival was observed following treatment with liraglutide in ffa environment , suggesting that liraglutide protected beta cells from death .
in addition , the ultrastructure analysis of pa - treated ins - 1 cells clearly demonstrated the formation of double - membrane autophagosomes and single membrane autolysosomes with the treatment of liraglutide .
conversion of lc3 - ito lc3 - iiin ffa - induced ins - 1 cells was significantly increased following the addition of liraglutide .
such conversion was increased in presence of ffa alone with relatively weak efficiency ( 16 ) .
our results demonstrated that liraglutide was able to elicit autophagosome formation .
some debris in autolysosomes suggested that cytoplasmic organelles were functionally degraded by autophagy .
all the data presented in this report suggested that ffa - induced ins - 1 cells death was improved in the presence of liraglutide by stimulated autophagy .
it was previously proposed that beta cells lipotoxicity was directly induced by pa at least in part via pathways involving ers and reactive oxygen species ( ros )( 17 , 18 ) .
lipotoxic ers - mediated beta cell dysfunction and apoptosis may be relevant in the development of t2d .
saturated and , to a lesser extent , unsaturated ffa trigger beta cell er stress .
physical er stress occurs when high demand for protein load occurs , which is readily mitigated by upr and is actually favorable to the beta cells ( 19 ) .
but persistent er stress results in rapid accumulation of unfolded proteins , which triggers beta cell apoptosis ( 20 ) .
it is suggested that beta cell survival in ffa was the consequence of the enhanced capacity to handle the upr and thereby prevented ins - 1 cell apoptosis from lipotoxic ers .
in addition to ers , pancreatic beta cells were prone to oxidative stress , due to the fact that antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase ( sod ) , glutathione peroxidase and catalase were present at low levels in beta cells ( 21 ) .
oxidative stress can also lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins .
according to these published results , the protective role of liraglutide observed in our study might be due to the degradation of misfolded proteins accumulation .
liraglutide , a long - acting glp - 1 analogue , is more efficient in protection of beta cells than native glp - 1 .
liraglutide inhibited cytokine - induced and ffa - induced apoptosis in islet cells in a dose - dependent manner , which has been concluded that liraglutidemight be useful for retaining beta cell mass in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients ( 3 ) .
liraglutide mediates its anti - apoptotic effects through glp - 1 receptor and its associated signaling cascade ( 3 ) .
shimoda 's results supported that liraglutide affected pancreatic beta cell mass in diabetic conditions by directly stimulating cellular proliferation and could reduce triacylglycerol content in db / db mice ( 22 ) .
several studies provided evidences of liraglutide of ameliorating ers .
liraglutideexerts its effects by inducing mitochondrial fusion , which prevented the onset of ers induced by high - glucose ( 23 ) .
in addition , liraglutide reduced and suppressed oxidative and er stress by downregulating pro - apoptosis genes and those involved in lipid synthesis ( 22 ) .
the ultrastructure analysis of pa - treated ins - 1 cells in our study clearly indicated the presence of induced autophagy .
not only did these results suggestedliraglutide stimulated autophagy , but it also provided evidences as to why liraglutide could improve ins - 1 cell survival .
to investigate the role of autophagy in pa - induced ins - 1 cell death , 3 - ma , a specific inhibitor of class iii pi3k was used in our research .
an augment of pa - induced ins - 1 cell death was shown following treatment of 3 - ma , indicating a protective role of autophagy in pa environment .
as an adaptive process responding to the metabolic stress , the activated autophagy finally results in degradation of intracellular protein and organelles ( 24 ) .
some debris in autolysosomes suggested that cytoplasmic organelles were functionally degraded by autophagy ( 16 ) .
thus , autophagy was responsible for removing the overload of unfolded and misfolded protein that exceeded the er capacity ( 25 ) .
on the other hand , autophagy could also be implicated in cell death via apoptosis .
it was possible that autophagy determined cell fate depending upon the kind and severity of stress ( 26 , 27 ) .
in recent research , macro - autophagy has been identified as a mechanism for removal of fatty acid loads from hepatocytes ( 7 ) .
studies by singh et al .
( 9 ) considered autophagy targeting lipids inside the celllipoautpphagy .
sharma concluded that glp - 1 reduced the fat load in hepatocytes by inducing autophagy .
exendin - 4 significantly increased the rate of autophagosome and autophagolysosome formation or autophagic flux ( 7 ) .
all the published results indicated that liraglutide induced the level of autophagy to ameliorate ffa - induced cell death from different perspectives .
firstly , liraglutide exerts its effect through controlling lipid synthesis , and the other mechanism was to remove already accumulated fat load in cells .
these provided data consistently supported our observations that autophagy has been involved in liraglutide 's protective effect .
in conclusion , our data showed that liraglutide stimulated autophagy in pa - treated ins - 1 cells , and induced autophagy played a protective role in pa - induced cell death .
autophagy exerts its effect in ameliorating ers and removing fat load .
therapies that increase beta cell resistance to ffa by liraglutide , may have clinical application , as they prevent t2d or attenuate the progression of the disease .

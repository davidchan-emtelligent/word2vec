the past decade has witnessed the rapid development of new mri technology for vessel wall imaging .
today , with advances in mri hardware and pulse sequences , quantitative mri of the vessel wall represents a real alternative to conventional qualitative imaging , which is hindered by significant intra - and inter - observer variability .
quantitative mri can measure several important morphological and functional characteristics of the vessel wall .
this review provides a detailed introduction to novel quantitative mri methods for measuring vessel wall dimensions , plaque composition and permeability , endothelial shear stress and wall stiffness .
together , these methods show the versatility of non - invasive quantitative mri for probing vascular disease at several stages .
these quantitative mri biomarkers can play an important role in the context of both treatment response monitoring and risk prediction .
given the rapid developments in scan acceleration techniques and novel image reconstruction , we foresee the possibility of integrating the acquisition of multiple quantitative vessel wall parameters within a single scan session .

atherosclerosis consists in the formation of " plaques " in the arterial vessel wall .
endothelial dysfunction , mainly related to local reduction of wall shear stress in the presence of non - laminar flow profiles , plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of atherogenesis .
disruption of the endothelial barrier facilitates the subendothelial accumulation of lipids , which triggers the initial inflammatory response that leads to plaque formation .
subsequent progression of atherosclerotic disease involves numerous processes that continuously alter vessel wall composition , including smooth muscle proliferation and angiogenesis , as well as the formation of intraplaque hemorrhage ( iph ) , lipid necrotic core and calcifications [ 2 , 3 ] .
non - invasive imaging techniques have played an important role in the assessment of different plaque phenotypes , as well as in measuring changes in biological processes that occur during the different stages of atherosclerosis development [ 4 ] .
vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) has proven to be a powerful technique for characterizing atherosclerosis in various regions of the vascular system , including the carotid and coronary arteries , aorta , and peripheral and intracranial arteries [ 5 - 10 ]. by enabling the evaluation of plaque composition and physiology , in vivo vessel wall mri has helped refine the assessment of plaque risk profiles for rupture and subsequent cardiovascular events beyond simple lesion size [ 11 , 12 ] .
initial studies used qualitative imaging primarily for identifying distinct patterns of high / low signal intensity associated with different phenotypes of atherosclerotic plaque .
in the past few years , however , there has been increasing interest in developing imaging methods that provide quantitative data related to vessel wall structure and function .
not only does this improve longitudinal monitoring of the progression of atherosclerosis ; it also provides sensitive disease markers that may serve as surrogate endpoints for evaluating the effect of novel treatment strategies .
contrast between different plaque components may originate from differences in their relaxation time constants t1 and t2 .
these values can be quantified in each voxel by parametric fitting of several images with different contrast weighting .
the resulting t1 and t2 maps enable automated plaque segmentation in its various constituents .
additionally , the mr signal can be made sensitive to water diffusion , which can be used to map the spatial variation in the apparent diffusion coefficient ( adc ) within the plaque .
this is of particular interest for detecting lipid accumulation , one of the major risk factors associated with plaque rupture .
contrast - enhanced mri has been used to assess changes in vessel wall permeability , which can be increased both through disruption of the luminal endothelial layer and by the formation of leaky angiogenic vessels within the plaque .
more specifically , imaging with dynamic contrast - enhanced ( dce ) mri , a technique that samples the influx of contrast agent in the plaque over time using fast t1 - weighted ( t1w ) imaging sequences , has enabled the quantification of several pharmacokinetic parameters , including endothelial permeability and microvascular volume .
finally , blood flow measurements with phase - contrast mri can be used to quantify pulse wave velocity ( pwv ) , which is a common evaluation of vessel wall stiffness .
more recently , 4d flow mri has enabled local measurement of wall shear stress ( wss ) , which plays a crucial role in vascular endothelial function .
in this review , we present emerging techniques for quantitative mr imaging of the vessel wall .
while the main focus will be on the carotid arteries , the most extensively studied vascular bed , examples in other vascular regions ( aorta , intracranial vessels ) will also be touched upon .
we will present the latest developments in mr sequence and protocol design , and discuss their advantages and pitfalls in the quantification of vessel wall composition and function .
while vessel wall thickness reflects anatomical rather than structural / functional information , it is still considered an important quantitative parameter in characterizing atherosclerotic burden .
we therefore start with a short overview of different two - and three - dimensional sequences that are used for this purpose , which are often the basis for other quantitative methods as well .
finally , we will present current promising developments in mri that will allow further improvement in the techniques presented here .
plaque burden vessel wall thickening is one of the early visible manifestations of atherosclerosis , and therefore remains one of the most important diagnostic readouts of atherosclerotic burden .
large clinical studies have demonstrated an association between carotid intima - media thickness as measured with ultrasound , and overall risk for cardiovascular events such as stroke or myocardial infarction [ 13 , 14 ] .
ultrasound still remains the first choice in clinical practice for assessing carotid stenosis after ischemic events , not least for its cost effectiveness .
however , black - blood mri techniques for measuring plaque burden have improved tremendously in recent years , and are increasingly used in studies on atherosclerosis progression or treatment effect [ 15 - 17 ] .
moreover , mri has no limitations in depth penetration and is thus a powerful tool for investigating not only superficial arteries such as the carotids , but also those such as the intracranial [ 18 ] and coronary arteries [ 7 ] .
2d black - blood mri blood suppression is essential for achieving accurate delineation of the vessel wall , which would otherwise be compromised by smearing of the bright - blood lumen signal .
two - dimensional ( 2d ) t2 - weighted ( t2w ) spin - echo sequences have inherent blood suppression due to outflow effects at long echo times ; however , this mechanism is not compatible with short echo times needed for t1w imaging .
the first robust technique allowing for 2d t1w black - blood imaging of the arterial vessel wall was proposed by edelman et al .
[ 19 ] .
this spin - echo - based method achieves blood suppression by using a pair of non - selective and slice - selective inversion pulses ( double - inversion recovery axial image recovery , or dir ) , thereby effectively inverting only the tissue and blood outside the imaging slice ( fig. 1a ) .
the inversion time ( ti ) between the inversion pulses and imaging readout is chosen such that blood longitudinal magnetization is nulled ( as a result of t1 relaxation ) , while at the same time non - inverted blood flows out of the imaging slice .
the slightly higher signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and robust blood suppression make t1w imaging the preferred choice for 2d vessel wall thickness measurements .
unfortunately , the dependency on blood outflow from the imaging slice renders a multi - slice or three - dimensional ( 3d ) implementation ineffective [ 20 ] .
another problem obviously arises when post - contrast measurements are performed , where the t1 of blood decreases significantly , and the optimal ti is difficult to determine beforehand .
yarnykh , however , has proposed an elegant solution by introducing a second inversion pair ( quadruple inversion recovery , or qir ) , making blood suppression effective over a much larger range of t1 values [ 21 ]. fig. 1 2d / 3d blood suppression techniques .
a 2d double / quadruple inversion recovery .
non - selective inversion of inflowing blood generates black - blood at a correctly timed inversion time .
b 3d variable flip angle tse .
frequency encoding gradients within the tse readout have flow suppression properties in that direction .
the point - spread function of the acquisition can be improved by variable flip angle schemes .
c 3d motion - sensitized driven equilibrium ( msde ) .
within a t2 preparation module , strong gradients dephase moving spins within a voxel , effectively crushing the blood signal .
magnetization of static tissue , although slightly t2 - weighted , is restored by a final tip - up pulse .
subsequently , a 3d tfe / tse readout can be applied 3d black - blood mri increasing interest in isotropic 3d imaging protocols has led to the development of 3d black - blood imaging sequences that do not rely on outflow effects and are therefore more robust against slow flow artifacts .
3d turbo spin - echo ( tse ) sequences actually have inherent black - blood properties themselves , caused by the buildup of intravoxel dephasing as a result of the positive gradient moment of the readout gradient during the echo train .
while this was presented in the early literature as an alternative to bright - blood brain angiography [ 22 ] , successful implementation for vessel wall imaging required novel variable - flip - angle ( vfa ) refocusing schemes [ 23 - 25 ] that also allowed a stable signal response for longer echo trains ( fig. 1b ) .
this ensures a favorable point - spread function to prevent blurring of the thin vessel wall .
naturally , this can only be achieved for specific values of t1 and t2 , and the exact choice of flip angle scheme will always be a trade - off between tissue contrast and effectiveness of flow suppression .
another class of black - blood methods achieves blood suppression independent of the acquisition scheme through the use of black - blood preparation modules .
one method , motion - sensitized driven equilibrium ( msde , fig. 1c ) , combines t2 preparation with flow - sensitizing gradients [ 26 , 27 ] .
if the first moment of the preparation module is sufficiently high , intravoxel dephasing for flowing blood occurs , while the static tissue effectively only undergoes t2 relaxation during the time interval teprep . the final tip - up pulse restores the static tissue longitudinal magnetization for subsequent readout using turbo field - echo ( tfe ) or tse acquisition schemes .
as shown by fan et al .
[ 23 ] , the latter seems the more effective strategy , as it adds the black - blood properties of the tse readout .
an alternative preparation method uses so called - dante ( delay alternating with nutation for tailored excitation ) , consisting of a non - selective train of small - flip - angle rf pulses [ 28 , 29 ] .
while this preparation is much longer than msde (~ 100 - 150 ms ) , static tissue signal is better preserved and suppression occurs even at low velocities .
dante is particularly promising for intracranial imaging , where it also enhances suppression of cerebrospinal fluid closely surrounding the vessels [ 30 - 33 ] .
2d versus 3d imaging figure 2a shows examples of 3d msde tfe and vfa tse carotid scans in the same volunteer , illustrating the ability to acquire black - blood coronal images covering the common and internal carotid arteries .
because of the isotropic voxels , these data can easily be reformatted into sagittal and axial views .
figure 2b clearly illustrates that 2d compared to 3d imaging may result in overestimation of wall thickness in regions near or within the bifurcation , where the vessel diameter changes quickly .
on the other hand , we also know that in locations with less curvature , ecg - gated 2d dir scans with in - plane resolution of 0.25 mm have optimal vessel wall delineation , as shown in fig. 2c .
these measurements were validated against histology and ultrasound in a pig model [ 34 ] , and resulted in a mean carotid vessel wall thickness of 0.49 mm [ 35 ]. fig. 2 vessel wall imaging using 2d and 3d imaging sequences .
sequence parameters : a fov = 144 x 144 x 35 mm , resolution = 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 mm .
3d msde , tr / te = 10.0 / 3.5 ms , teprep = 11.5 ms , tfe factor = 60 , acq time = 3 min .
3d vfa tse , tr / te = 1000 / 28 ms , incrementte = 4.3 ms , tse factor = 40 , start - up echoes = 4 , acq time = 6 min .
b 3d tse , same as ( a ) , 2d dir , st = 2 mm , resolution = 0.5 x 0.5 mm , tr / te = 1000 / 3.5 ms , ti = 400 ms c 2d dir , same as ( b ) , but with resolution = 0.25 x 0.25 mm given the current resolution in 3d mri protocols , overestimation of vessel wall thickness is likely to occur [ 36 ] - - especially considering smaller vessels such as the intracranial or coronary arteries [ 37 , 38 ] - - although this issue may be less problematic in later stages of atherosclerosis , where plaque formation has caused significant wall thickening [ 39 ] .
while excellent reproducibility values for 2d thickness measurements have been reported for carotid and aortic vessel walls [ 40 , 41 ] , a great advantage of 3d imaging is that it requires no tedious , accurate planning of the imaging slices , while still allowing reconstructions in arbitrary planes .
this may partly explain the good reproducibility of 3d black - blood methods reported for various applications , such as the carotid arteries [ 42 , 43 ] , thoracic aortic wall [ 8 , 24 , 44 ] , abdominal aorta [ 44 ] and even the coronary arteries [ 38 ] .
while generally not applied , ecg and / or respiratory triggering can further minimize blurring due to vessel wall pulsation or breathing motion [ 8 ] .
although different black - blood mechanisms can be easily described , their exact performance in terms of snr , tissue / lumen contrast - to - noise ratio ( cnr ) , and effective resolution are highly dependent on the exact sequence parameters , including both the preparation module and the specific acquisition scheme ( e.g. tfe vs. tse ) .
while comparisons between different methods have been reported [ 29 ] , the large number of sequence parameters makes a fair comparison very challenging .
consequently , no consensus on optimal vessel wall imaging protocols has been reported thus far .
plaque composition the excellent intrinsic soft tissue contrast of mri has enabled visualization of different structural components within the plaque , such as lipid - rich necrotic core ( lrnc ) , calcification ( ca ) , fibrous tissue ( fib ) and intraplaque hemorrhage ( iph ) .
to this end , many studies have used multi - contrast - weighted imaging , in which each component can be identified by the specific combination of hypo - and / or hyperintense signal intensities on t1 - , t2 (*) - and protein density - weighted ( pdw ) images [ 6 , 45 , 46 ] .
although accumulating evidence from imaging studies shows that the presence or absence of these components can be related to subsequent cardiovascular events [ 11 , 47 ] , qualitative interpretation of these images or the need to calculate relative signal intensities ( e.g. compared to sternocleidomastoid muscle ) gives rise to high intra / inter - observer variability [ 48 ] .
this is mainly due to the strong influence of spatial variations in coil sensitivity on relative signal intensity , as well as the specific choice of mr sequence parameters .
therefore , the quantification of t1 and t2 (*) relaxation time constants of tissue on a voxel - wise basis - - as quantitative measures of the underlying tissue composition - - is of great interest .
while quantitative t1 and t2 (*) values have been reported in histological studies of carotid endarterectomy specimens [ 49 , 50 ] , translation of existing techniques to in vivo vessel wall imaging has long been complicated by the additional need for high - resolution imaging , blood suppression and cardiac gating .
the following sections will present the newest techniques that have overcome most of these challenges .
t1 and t2 (*) relaxometry results from multi - contrast imaging studies show that lrnc has lower t2 than healthy intima / media .
although iph may show large changes in t2 over time [ 51 ] , the most commonly found " recent iph " is associated with elevated t2 values .
a traditional way of measuring t2 is by exponential fitting of signal intensities acquired with multi - echo spin - echo sequences ( fig. 3a ) .
while the early literature had already reported in vivo vessel wall t2 quantification from dual spin - echo sequences [ 52 ] , biasiolli et al. have only recently improved this approach , allowing for acquisition of multiple echoes between 25 and 100 ms [ 53 ] .
since the need for relatively short echo times reduces the outflow effect compared to regular t2w spin - echo sequences , blood suppression was enhanced using dir preparation ( fig. 1a ) .
figure 3b nicely illustrates a t2w image of an advanced plaque , along with corresponding quantitative t2 maps .
in this study , the mean values for fib and lrnc were 56 +/ - 9 and 37 +/ - 5 ms , while various patches of iph had t2 values > 90 ms. by training a bayes classifier using expert readings of co - registered multi - contrast data , the authors developed an automated segmentation algorithm that discriminates the various plaque components based on their absolute t2 values .
a significant drawback of the method is that it is limited to 2d imaging , with a relatively long acquisition time of 320 r - r intervals despite the use of 5 / 8 partial fourier acceleration .
nonetheless , these results show that all relevant plaque components may be discriminated on the basis of t2 alone. fig. 3 a quantitative vessel wall t2 mapping .

( 19 ) and chai et al .
[ 66 ] instead of using multi - echo spin - echo - based sequences , t2 * can be determined using a blood - suppressed multi - echo gradient echo approach , with typical echo times of 3 - 40 ms. unlike t2 , t2 * is strongly affected by the presence of magnetic field inhomogeneities and thus might not solely reflect tissue structure .
at the same time , this makes t2 * imaging very sensitive in detecting protein - bound iron .
raman et al .
[ 54 ] were the first to conduct an extensive study of the role of iron in atherosclerosis using quantitative t2 * measurements .
they found a significant decrease in t2 * between asymptomatic ( 34.4 +/ - 2.7 ms ) and symptomatic patients ( 20.0 +/ - 1.8 ms ) .
furthermore , ex vivo iron quantification in endarterectomy specimens showed equal total iron content in both groups , but greatly reduced levels of paramagnetic fe ( iii ) complexes .
overall , these results strongly suggest that symptomatic plaques are associated with higher amounts of ferritin - bound iron , which was sensitively assessed using quantitative t2 * mri .
in addition to endogenous iron , t2 * - weighted imaging has also been frequently used to detect macrophage - mediated uptake of intravenously injected superparamagnetic iron oxide ( spio ) particles as a surrogate marker of plaque inflammation [ 55 , 56 ] .
however , such studies still suffered from the use qualitative mri methods [ 57 ] .
in more recent studies , quantitative t2 * mapping has been applied in combination with qir blood suppression in order to increase the accuracy in assessing spio accumulation by calculating deltat2 * or deltar2 * between pre - and post - contrast scans [ 58 , 59 ] .
while t2 * values can be prone to magnetic field inhomogeneities , both studies did report similar baseline t2 * values of approximately 25 ms , indicating good reproducibility with this approach .
unfortunately , 3d implementation of these multi - echo techniques has not yet proven feasible , most likely due to the inevitable increase in repetition time , leading to clinically unacceptable acquisition times .
t1 mapping methods are well validated in areas such as brain or cardiac imaging , and in these areas they are generally based on steady - state imaging at multiple flip angles or sampling of the inversion recovery longitudinal relaxation curve [ 60 , 61 ] .
unfortunately , these are all bright - blood techniques that compromise vessel wall delineation and are susceptible to flow artifacts .
we recently developed a black - blood version of the despot1 approach [ 60 ] by using msde blood suppression with short pre - pulses of 11.5 ms and maintaining steady - state conditions of the 3d rf spoiled gradient echo train by adding dummy pulses after signal acquisition [ 62 ] .
this enabled 3d vessel wall t1 mapping with isotropic resolution of 0.7 mm. moreover , t2 mapping was possible using the same sequence by varying the teprep time of the msde pre - pulse .
while good reproducibility of this 3d approach was shown , both carotid t1 and t2 values ( 844 +/ - 96 ms / 39 +/ - 5 ) were lower than with single - slice tse - based measurements ( 1227 +/ - 47 / 55 +/ - 11 ms ) [ 63 ] .
furthermore , the use of msde pre - pulses causes t1 modulation in k - space , which can lead to some blurring of the resulting t1 maps .
figure 4a shows quantitative t1 mapping results from a carotid plaque where significantly reduced t1 is indicative of iph .
simultaneous non - contrast angiography and intraplaque hemorrhage ( snap ) is a recently published method for detecting iph , which can identify regions of iph by phase - sensitive reconstruction of inversion recovery data [ 64 ] .
figure 4b shows snap + and snap - images corresponding to the region shown in fig. 4a , representing iph and arterial blood , respectively .
since the sign of the snap signal changes below a specific t1 value , we can show that the iph region visible in the snap + image can be recreated from the quantitative t1 map by simple thresholding. fig. 4 a quantitative 3d vessel wall t1 mapping .
the slice on the left shows regions of greatly reduced t1 , indicating iph .

regions with low quantitative t1 values match iph - positive regions from snap ( unpublished data ) while the main benefit in using quantitative t1 and t2 (*) mapping - - compared to multi - contrast t1w and t2 (*) w imaging - - is to improve reproducibility and facilitate longitudinal monitoring of changes in plaque composition , it still does not allow for direct assessment of the relative contribution of different tissues in each voxel .
in contrast , for instance , koppal et al. were able to assess quantitative maps of fat content based on dixon imaging , showing significant differences between the lipid core ( 12.6 %) and surrounding tissue ( 9.2 %) [ 65 ] .
on the other hand , the use of multi - contrast imaging to detect different plaque components ( i.e. lrnc , iph ) has been well validated against histology [ 45 , 51 ] .
quantitative relaxation parameter mapping extends this concept and might enable better definition of thresholds for discriminating between these different tissue types .
indeed , a recent study reported that lrnc detection based on t2 mapping - - pixels with t2 < 42 or t2 > 90 ms when iph was included - - showed very good correlation with histology ( r = 0.85 ) and had good sensitivity ( auc = 0.79 ) for detecting recently symptomatic plaques [ 66 ] .
diffusion mri is also able to quantify water diffusion within tissues .
strong field gradients applied on each side of a 180degrees refocusing pulse cause diffusion - mediated signal attenuation due to phase dispersion of spins .
conversely , in static tissue , the effect of both gradients cancels out and the signal is maintained .
the degree of diffusion weighting is given by the b - value , which depends on the gradient strength , duration and spacing [ 67 ] .
similar to varying te to quantify t2 (*) , the apparent diffusion coefficient ( adc ) can be estimated by an exponential fit of signals acquired at different b - values , which determines the amount of diffusion weighting .
in vessel wall imaging , diffusion weighting is of particular interest for detecting the presence of an lrnc , which from ex vivo studies has been known to have a strongly decreased adc [ 68 , 69 ] .
in fact , clarke et al. showed that , compared to t1 and t2 quantification , adc was the parameter that could best distinguish lrnc from fib [ 70 ] .
diffusion - weighted imaging ( dwi ) is typically performed using 2d single - shot echo - planar imaging ( epi ) sequences , which provides time efficiency for sufficient averaging of the low dw signal ( because of the additional need for long tes ) .
however , epi is very susceptible to b0 inhomogeneities , because phase errors accumulate for each additional phase encoding step .
kim et al .
[ 71 ] were the first to apply inner - volume imaging for vessel wall applications , reducing the effective field of view ( fov ) and thereby the echo train length by a factor of 4 .
in this way , good - quality adc maps of 2 - mm slices were obtained with a resolution of 1 x 1 mm2 .
this spatial resolution , however , is still inferior to the resolution used for vessel wall thickness measurements .
a novel approach enabling 3d vessel wall dwi was recently presented by xie et al .
[ 72 ] .
they decoupled diffusion weighting from the imaging readout through the use of a motion - compensated diffusion - weighted pre - pulse ( fig. 5a ) .
combined with 3d tse acquisitions , this resulted in high - resolution imaging of 0.6 x 0.6 x 2 mm3 ( fig. 5b ) .
additional double - inversion recovery preparation and low - b - value motion - sensitized gradient on top of diffusion weighting further guaranteed efficient blood suppression .
a large decrease in lrnc adc values compared to fib ( 0.6 x 10 - 3 vs. 1.27 x 10 - 3 mm2 / s ) was shown , indicating that adc mapping may serve as a sensitive and quantitative non - contrast technique for plaque characterization ( fig. 5c ) .
using a similar approach but with a stimulated echo pathway , zhang et al .
[ 73 ] recently showed that phase errors arising from eddy currents could be prevented .
this resulted in stable carotid artery adc values across subjects of 1.4 +/ - 0.23 x 10 - 3 , which is comparable to results of earlier studies. fig. 5 3d quantitative diffusion vessel wall imaging a ecg - gated 3d diffusion - prepared variable - flip - angle tse sequence .

[ 72 ] while challenging , extension of dwi to a diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) protocol using multiple gradient directions would allow calculation of the fractional anisotropy ( fa ) of the vessel wall microscopic fiber structure .
opriessnig et al .
[ 74 ] were recently the first to apply a 2d dti sequence using four b - values and 18 diffusion directions on a 10 - mm carotid artery segment .
in 12 healthy volunteers , the authors found a significant correlation between fa and age , indicating possible alterations of the vessel wall microstructural integrity .
moreover , the reproducibility of fa measurements appeared very high , with cv values no higher than approximately 5 % .
quantification of permeability with dynamic contrast - enhanced mri inflammation in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques , at high risk for causing severe , acute cardiovascular events , is accompanied by the proliferation of existing and new microvessels with high endothelial permeability [ 75 ] .
dynamic contrast - enhanced ( dce ) mri , a technique widely used to quantify endothelial permeability and microvascular volume in tumors [ 76 ] , has been widely adopted in the past 15 years for quantification of these parameters in atherosclerotic plaques as well .
dce - mri consists in the rapid serial acquisition of t1 - weighted mr images of a volume of interest while a t1 - shortening , gadolinium ( gd ) - based contrast agent is injected [ 76 ] .
during imaging , the contrast agent extravasates from the plasma compartment , and causes mr signal enhancement in permeable tissues .
tissue microvascular volume and permeability can then be extracted from the kinetics of tissue signal enhancement over time .
to calculate these quantities , mr signal enhancement curves are first converted to contrast agent concentration values , either by estimating the t1 relaxation time at each dynamic time frame , or by assuming a linear relationship between mr signal intensity and contrast agent concentration .
after conversion to concentration , pixel - by - pixel or region of interest ( roi ) concentration curves are typically analyzed using either model - based or non - model based approaches to calculate tissue properties ( fig. 6a ) , such as microvascular volume , permeability ( fig. 6b ) and extravascular extra - cellular space volume .
the most common kinetic models used for analysis of dce - mri are typically based on the modified tofts model [ 77 ]:\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ c _{\ text { tissue }} ( t ) = v _{\ text { p }} \ cdot c _{\ text { p }} ( t ) + k ^{\ text { trans }} \ int \ limits _{ 0 }^{ t } { c _{\ text { p }} ( t ') \ cdot e ^{{ - k ^{\ text { trans }} / v _{\ text { e }}\ cdot ( t ' - t )}} {\ text { d }} t '},$$\ end { document } ctissue ( t )= vp.cp ( t )+ ktransintegral0tcp ( t '). e - ktrans / ve.

in atherosclerosis , this model has often been used under the patlak assumption [ 78 , 79 ] , which assumes no contrast agent " backflow " from the tissue to the plasma compartment , as shown below :\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ c _{\ text { tissue }} ( t ) = v _{\ text { p }} \ cdot c _{\ text { p }} ( t ) + k ^{\ text { trans }} \ int \ limits _{ 0 }^{ t } { c _{\ text { p }} ( t ')\;{\ text { d }} t '} .$$\ end { document } ctissue ( t )= vp.cp ( t )+ ktransintegral0tcp ( t ') dt '. fig. 6 a representative concentration versus time curve kinetics in atherosclerotic plaques .

[ 79 ] in the literature , average plaque k trans values calculated using this model have ranged from 0.05 to 0.3 min - 1 [ 80 - 88 ] , while average v p values were found to vary between 4 and 25 % [ 78 , 83 , 85 , 87 , 89 ] .
these broad ranges may reflect differences in patient populations and / or disease stages in animal models , or different acquisition or analysis methods .
using a 2d bright - blood ( i.e. allowing sampling of the mr signal in the blood plasma during the dynamic acquisition ) spoiled gradient recalled echo ( spgr ) mr sequence and patlak kinetic analysis , kerwin et al .
[ 78 ] were the first to demonstrate a significant , positive correlation between microvessel density in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques ( cd31 immunostaining ) and the parameter v p ( fractional microvascular volume ) derived from dce - mri .
using this methodology , the same group also demonstrated a significant , positive relationship between v p , k trans ( permeability ) and plaque macrophages , neovasculature and loose matrix ( lm ) [ 83 ] .
as for clinical parameters , k trans was found to correlate with lower levels of high - density lipoproteins ( hdl ) [ 83 ] and higher levels of c - reactive protein [ 80 ] , and was higher in smokers than non - smokers [ 80 , 83 ] .
this analysis was extended to quantify the difference in dce - mri parameters between different plaque components including lrnc , iph , lm , fib and ca [ 89 ] .
it was demonstrated that while lm and fib showed relatively high values of k trans and v p , nc , iph and ca exhibited significantly lower k trans and v p. o'brien et al .
[ 85 , 90 ] recently demonstrated a relationship between the duration of statin therapy and v p from dce - mri : the shorter the duration of statin therapy , the higher the v p values .
the presence of metabolic syndrome , higher body mass index and plasma lipoprotein ( a ) values were also associated with higher v p values .
while the patlak model has been widely used for quantifying endothelial permeability and microvascular volume in atherosclerosis , the best choice of model for analyzing dce - mri data of the vessel wall is still a topic of investigation [ 79 , 91 ] .
as an alternative to kinetic modeling , non - model - based approaches , such as area under the enhancement curve ( auc ) , uptake slope , time to peak or maximum concentration , can also be used to analyze dce - mri data .
while the relationship between these non - model based parameters and microvascular volume and permeability is not straightforward , auc has been particularly valuable as a surrogate measure of plaque neovascularization and permeability calculated from so - called black - blood dce - mri data , where the mr signal from the blood plasma is purposively suppressed to improve vessel wall delineation , and kinetic modeling cannot be easily performed .
using black - blood dce - mri , calcagno et al .
[ 92 ] demonstrated a positive , significant correlation between the parameter auc and plaque microvessels count ( cd31 immunostaining ) in aortic plaques of atherosclerotic rabbits .
the reproducibility of this technique was also evaluated and was found to be very good [ 93 ] .
in addition , auc has been used as a surrogate marker of drug efficacy to evaluate the impact on vascular permeability / inflammation of several approved ( atorvastatin [ 94 ] , pioglitazone [ 95 ]) and novel ( liposomal corticosteroids [ 96 ] , liver x receptor [ lxr ] agonist [ 94 ]) drugs .
chen et al .
[ 97 ] showed an increase in both plaque k trans relative to skeletal muscle [ 98 ] and auc in aortic plaques of atherosclerotic rabbits between 3 and 6 months of an atherosclerotic diet .
auc was also used by calcagno et al .
[ 99 ] to compare perfusion / permeability by dce - mri to vascular inflammation by 18f - fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) uptake by positron emission tomography with computed tomography ( pet / ct ) in sub - clinical plaques of patients with risk factor for coronary artery disease ( cad ) .
in this case the authors found a weak negative relationship between the two techniques in this patient population .
since these initial applications , several significant developments have occurred in dce - mri of atherosclerosis .
for example , both bright - and black - blood studies described above primarily employed 2d single - or multi - slice imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution , but offered limited coverage along the vascular bed examined .
more recent studies have improved upon this aspect [ 86 , 88 , 100 - 102 ] , and proposed the use of 3d isotropic high - resolution vessel wall imaging with extensive coverage for vascular dce - mri .
using a bright - blood 3d gradient recalled echo ( gre ) approach , taqueti et al .
[ 100 ] demonstrated a positive , significant relationship between permeability by dce - mri and 18f - fdg pet / ct in patients with advanced carotid disease .
the authors also confirmed a positive , significant relationship between k trans and microvessels ( cd31 immunostaining ) and inflammation ( cd68 and major histocompatibility complex ii [ mhcii ] immunostaining ) in the same patient population .
similarly , van hoof et al .
[ 88 ] demonstrated a correlation between the vessel wall and adventitial k trans and plaque microvessels by histology in patients with carotid atherosclerosis .
using black - blood dce - mri instead , kim et al .
[ 103 ] , lobatto et al .
[ 102 ] and calcagno et al .
[ 86 ] were able to quantify endothelial permeability in the whole abdominal aorta of atherosclerotic rabbits .
these findings were confirmed by a positive , significant relationship between auc by 3d dce - mri and endothelial permeability by ex vivo near - infrared fluorescence using fluorescent albumin or evans blue dye ( fig. 7 ). fig. 7 3d vessel wall imaging .

prominent uptake of mr contrast and eb is shown in the diseased animals compared to the control .
adapted from [ 86 ] despite these significant advances , vascular dce - mri is still significantly challenged in achieving accurate quantification of plaque microvascular burden and permeability .
as mentioned above , it is difficult to extract fully quantitative information from black - blood vascular dce - mri ( either 2d or 3d ) , due to the inability to sample the concentration of contrast agent in the blood plasma ( the so - called arterial input function , aif ) , which is a necessary input for kinetic models .
on the other hand , even bright - blood vascular dce - mri approaches may carry some degree of error in the quantification of vascular permeability parameters , also stemming from potential inaccuracies when estimating the aif from the mr signal itself .
as with all other vessel wall imaging techniques , vascular dce - mri requires imaging with high spatial resolution , which may render the temporal resolution of the acquisition inadequate for sampling the fast contrast agent kinetics in the blood plasma .
in addition , mr sequence parameters used for dce - mri are typically optimized to accurately capture the dynamic signal range of enhancement in atherosclerotic plaques , and may not be adequate to accurately capture signal enhancement in the vessel lumen , where contrast agent concentrations are much higher , and t1 much lower , during dynamic imaging .
recent studies have focused on overcoming these challenges by proposing either 2d [ 104 ] or 3d [ 105 , 106 ] sequences that allow for accurate sampling of both blood and plaque kinetics , interleaving the acquisition of images with different spatial and temporal resolution and different imaging parameters .
for example , aif images can be acquired with lower spatial resolution , which allows for faster imaging ( high temporal resolution ) and imaging parameters optimized for the high signal enhancement ( low t1 values ) found in the vessel lumen .
conversely , plaque dynamic images can be acquired with high spatial resolution , lower temporal resolution , and imaging parameters optimized to capture the signal enhancement of the arterial vessel wall .
other authors have instead explored the use of phased - based rather than magnitude - based aifs for kinetic modeling of vascular dce - mri data [ 107 ] .
using simulations and phantom experiments , the authors found that phase - based aif offered a more accurate sampling of the true contrast agent kinetics in the blood plasma .
while the absolute value of kinetic parameters derived from magnitude - and phase - based aif were different , they were shown to be highly correlated .
alternative techniques for measuring permeability in addition to dce - mri , various other techniques have been proposed for quantifying endothelial permeability in atherosclerotic plaques .
delayed - enhancement imaging with either low molecular weight gadolinium chelates or albumin - binding agents has been used as a semi - quantitative measure of plaque permeability in both animal models ( mice [ 108 ] , rabbits [ 109 - 111 ]) and humans [ 112 , 113 ] .
phinikaridou et al .
[ 114 ] and bar et al .
[ 115 ] quantified endothelial permeability in the brachiocephalic artery of atherosclerotic mice as a change in the vessel wall relaxation rate ( r1 , s - 1 ) 30 min after injection of an albumin - binding contrast agent ( gadofosveset trisodium ) .
this technique has also been used successfully to quantify changes in permeability in the murine brachiocephalic artery after therapeutic intervention [ 111 , 116 ] .
more recently , phinikaridou et al .
[ 117 ] used this same technique to quantify endothelial permeability in aortic plaques in atherosclerotic rabbits , and demonstrated higher r1 ( indicative of higher permeability ) in aortic segments more prone to disruption after injection of russell 's viper venom .
unlike quantitative dynamic imaging with dce - mri , these techniques measure signal enhancement or quantify tissue relaxation time only at a fixed point after contrast agent injection .
this approach is particularly well suited for higher molecular weight or albumin - binding contrast agents , whose plaque uptake kinetics are intrinsically slower .
while failing to capture the dynamic uptake of contrast agents over time , these techniques offer a simpler and robust alternative to dce - mri for quantification of plaque microvascularization and permeability .
flow - derived biomechanical wall parameters wall shear stress atherosclerosis originates predominantly at regions with perturbed flow that can occur at the outer edges of vessel bifurcations .
in these regions , hemodynamic wall shear stress ( wss ) , the frictional force sensitized by endothelial cells forming the inner lining of blood vessels , is weaker than in protected regions and can even exhibit direction reversal .
the atherogenic endothelial phenotype resulting from low wss mediates recruitment and activation of monocytes , which can subsequently lead to plaque formation [ 118 ] .
wss is also known to increase with increasing blood flow .
in response , the vessel dilates to reduce blood flow such that wss returns to normal values .
regions where wss is chronically elevated , such as the apices of bifurcations in the cerebral vasculature , are predisposed to the formation of aneurysms [ 119 ] .
wss therefore represents a key link between blood flow and alterations in biomechanical vessel wall parameters .
flow measurement using mri has traditionally been performed using 2d phase - contrast imaging in most vascular beds. with gating to the cardiac cycle , a time - resolved ( cine ) measurement can be performed [ 120 ] .
currently , a comprehensive assessment of flow in an entire 3d volume ( 3d cine phase - contrast mri or 4d flow mri ) is feasible [ 121 ] , enabling the measurement of full time - varying 3d velocity fields in a wide variety of cardiovascular regions [ 122 ] .
the importance of wss in vascular disease has led to widespread interest among researchers in obtaining reliable estimates of wss from mri - measured velocity data .
oshinski et al. were the first to develop a method based on linear fitting through velocity values to obtain the velocity derivative ( the shear rate ) at the wall [ 123 ] .
multiplication of the shear rate by dynamic viscosity yields the wss .
other groups developed wss estimation based on parabolic fitting , which showed greater accuracy than linear fitting [ 124 , 125 ] .
stalder et al. used cubic b - splines to derive the shear rate at the wall [ 126 ] .
another important hemodynamic parameter shown to correlate with atherosclerosis is the oscillatory shear index ( osi ) [ 127 ] .
osi represents the temporal oscillation of wss during the cardiac cycle , the deviation of wss from its predominant direction parallel to the vessel .
thus , the osi can be calculated using methods to estimate time - resolved wss .
these techniques applied to mri - measured flow data have provided valuable insight into the relation between abnormal wss and pathophysiology .
duivenvoorden et al. showed that wss was an independent predictor of carotid wall thickness , lumen area and vessel size [ 128 ] .
mutsaerts et al. found that wss was associated with periventricular white matter lesions and cerebral infarcts [ 129 ] .
markl et al. observed that low wss and high osi , which are potentially atherogenic wall parameters , were predominantly concentrated at the posterior wall of the internal carotid artery in normal controls , a region known to be prone to atherosclerosis [ 130 ] .
wentzel et al. reported that the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in the descending aorta was associated with low wss [ 131 ] .
other studies showed that wss on the ascending aorta was elevated compared to healthy controls in bicuspid valve disease , which implicates a relationship between elevated wss and aortic dilation [ 132 , 133 ] .
however , these algorithms were based on 2d phase - contrast mri or the manual placement of planes in 4d flow mri data perpendicular to the vessel of interest. with 2d techniques highly focused on specific vascular landmarks , focal abnormal wss expression on the vessel of interest may be missed .
also , the manual placement of 2d planes for wss analysis can be a laborious task .
bieging et al. were the first to develop a wss algorithm based on 4d flow mri that was capable of estimating wss along the entire wall of the ascending aorta [ 134 ] .
the linear least squares method was used to fit a line through three velocity vectors along the inward normal .
potters et al. expanded on this method with the use of smoothing spline fitting to mitigate the influence of noise .
the feasibility of estimating wss along the entire aorta ( the arch and descending part included ) and the carotid bifurcation was also demonstrated ( see fig. 8a [ 135 ]) .
cibis et al. recently found an inverse relationship between wall thickness and time - averaged wss in patients with asymptomatic plaque , calculated with the algorithm described in potters et al. in the carotid bifurcation ( fig. 8b ) [ 136 ]. fig. 8 a peak systolic wss vectors along the carotid ( left ) and thoracic aorta ( right ) .

adapted from cibis et al .
[ 136 ] some important considerations should be kept in mind when estimating 4d flow mri - derived wss .
first , several studies showed that an accurate definition of the vessel wall is paramount [ 125 , 135 ] .
nonetheless , low inter - observer variability in wss was found for both 2d (< 10 %) and 3d (< 5 %) wss algorithms [ 137 , 138 ] .
second , the absolute value of wss decreases with spatial resolution [ 126 , 135 ] .
thus , 4d flow mri - derived wss is always underestimated compared to computational fluid dynamics where fine meshes are used [ 139 ] .
qualitatively , however , regions of high and low wss and the direction of wss tend to correspond well [ 140 - 142 ]( fig. 7 ) .
arterial stiffness another parameter that can be assessed using phase - contrast mri is pulse wave velocity ( pwv ) , which characterizes the speed of the arterial pulse through a specific part of the circulation .
pwv is a measure of arterial stiffness and can be directly correlated with the vessel wall elastic modulus e using the moens - korteweg equation :\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ text { pwv = }}\ sqrt {\ frac { eh }{\ rho d }},$$\ end { document } pwv = ehrhod , where h is the vessel wall thickness , rho is the blood density and d is the vessel diameter .
the elasticity of the vessel wall decreases as part of natural aging .
mri - based pwv measurements have indeed shown significant increases in pwv as a function of age in the carotid arteries and the aorta [ 143 ] , ranging from roughly 5 m / s for young adults to 7 - 8 m / s in the elderly .
more importantly , arterial stiffness has also been associated with atherosclerosis [ 144 ] , and studies have shown that the measurement of pwv in various vascular beds significantly improves the prediction of future cardiovascular events [ 145 - 147 ] .
while doppler ultrasound is the clinical workhorse for determining pwv , mri might offer several advantages .
particularly in 3d anatomical imaging , mri enables better visualization of each vessel segment , independent of angle and depth .
this likely improves reproducibility due to ease of planning , as well as by a more accurate determination of the path length of the pulse wave [ 148 , 149 ] .
many approaches to calculate pwv are mentioned in the literature and unfortunately no clear consensus exists on which method produces most reliable pwv values .
the most widely used method is by measuring flow - time curves at two different slices along the vessel .
the so - called foot - foot method can then be used to calculate pwv by dividing the path length between the slices by the time difference between the initial up - slopes of the two flow curves ( fig. 9a ) .
the exact location of the foot is slightly affected by the baseline definition and the number of points used to define the linear part of the up - slope ( usually 20 - 80 % of the maximum flow ) .
another analysis method finds the time shift at which both curves have the highest correlation ; however , this can be affected by the correlation window and presence of wave reflections starting from the systolic downslope [ 150 ] .
instead of relying on phase - contrast acquisitions in two slices , pwv could be calculated from measurements in a single or multiple oblique sagittal slices [ 151 , 152 ] .
flow - time curves could then be plotted for each pixel along a centerline of the vessel , which produces a set of time shifts as a function of distance , presumably resulting in a more reliable estimate of pwv .
for the aorta , this has been extended to volumetric flow measurements using highly accelerated 4d flow acquisitions , which further facilitates the planning of the imaging volume ( see [ 153 ] , fig. 8 ) .
tortuous vessels such as the carotids could benefit from this methodology , although temporal and spatial resolution still appear to be too low for this specific application .
a third method provides even more local vessel wall pwv values by assessing changes in lumen diameter ( a ) as a function of flow ( q ) at different time points during the cardiac cycle , where pwv is given by deltaq / deltaa during the initial up - slope of this relation ( fig. 9b ) .
in a study comparing the above - mentioned methods for the aorta , ibrahim et al. found the best agreement between the foot - foot and cross - correlation methods , which also showed the highest reproducibility [ 148 ] .
while analytical methods vary widely among studies , results for group - averaged aortic pwv have been quite consistent ( 4 - 5 m / s ) in young adults [ 149 - 151 , 154 ] .
unfortunately , less data is available on carotid pwv (~ 5.5 m / s ) and femoral arteries (~ 7 m / s ) [ 143 , 155 ] , for which the latter interestingly seems to decrease with age .
finally , while repeated measurements on the same day have shown good repeatability [ 149 , 156 ] , day - to - day physiological variations in blood pressure and blood flow might limit the applicability of pwv measurements for sensitive monitoring of gradual changes over time. fig. 9 different techniques for determing pulse wave velocity ( pwv ) in the aorta .

adapted from [ 148 ] summary and future perspectives in the last decade , technological advances have strengthened the position of mri in the assessment of quantitative , physiological parameters regarding tissue structure and pathology .
3d blood suppression techniques and 3d time - resolved ( 4d ) imaging have enabled the development of strategies for assessing the anatomical , structural and functional status of the vessel wall .
a few consensus statements have been published on specific applications discussed in this review [ 157 , 158 ] .
similar publications on " best practice " vessel wall imaging protocols are needed , and will help to propel this novel research field forward .
in this respect , reproducibility studies on quantitative vessel wall t1 / t2 (*) , dce and flow imaging protocols are highly important .
aside from what is presented in this review , the search continues for mr techniques that quantify other specific markers related to vessel wall pathology , e.g. strain [ 159 ] , or other contrast mechanisms to increase sensitivity for specific atherosclerotic plaque features .
the latter might include t1rho imaging for assessment of fibrosis [ 160 ] or susceptibility - weighted imaging to detect calcifications [ 161 ] .
while there is much interest in techniques that do not rely on the use of mri contrast agents , this review has shown the relevance of dce imaging for measuring plaque microvascular volume and permeability , which are strongly associated with vessel wall inflammation .
the use of untargeted iron oxide nanoparticles has also been briefly discussed here .
novel " smart " nanoparticles that specifically target biomarkers of inflammation have yielded very promising results in animal models of atherosclerosis [ 162 - 164 ]. by labeling with mri contrast agents , accumulation of these nanoparticles could be quantified using t1 and / or t2 mapping protocols as described in this review .
mri of nuclei other than 1h , such as 19f , is also a topic of active investigation for the absolute quantification of plaque inflammation using perfluorocarbons [ 165 ] .
quantifying physiologically relevant parameters in addition to standard anatomical imaging naturally entails longer acquisition times and / or reduced snr .
furthermore , several sources of errors , such as the choice of fitting algorithm , motion artifacts , and data snr , may affect parameter quantification .
aside from developing new quantitative readouts , current efforts are predominantly focused on improving the accuracy , precision and scan efficiency of existing methods by making use of ultra - high - field imaging as well as novel reconstruction algorithms .
7t mri recent years have seen the introduction of 7t imaging in clinical research , with the direct advantage of an increase in snr directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field [ 166 ] .
while challenging at 3t [ 167 ] , this makes 7t mri of particular interest for characterization of intracranial atherosclerosis , where the even smaller vessel size requires sufficient signal for accurate delineation of the vessel wall .
researchers from umc utrecht have been pioneers in this field by developing 7t intracranial vessel wall imaging protocols [ 168 ] , as well as evaluating the benefit of 7t versus 3t mri in detecting atherosclerotic plaques ( see also fig. 10 ) [ 18 ] .
on the one hand , they found that 7t mri resulted in better wall definition .
this was mainly achieved by exploiting the increased snr for higher acceleration factors , enabling the use of very robust but inherently time - inefficient inversion recovery - based cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) suppression .
although in many cases lesions were detected only at 7t , the authors also noted a significant number of cases showing the opposite .
similarly , studies to date on carotid plaque characterization have shown no strong indications of the superiority of 7t over 3t [ 169 , 170 ] , which might be related to the more inhomogeneous transmit field at 7t compromising non - selective blood suppression techniques , as well as signal homogeneity .
in this respect , there is a considerable need for better - designed high - field carotid coils in order to achieve improved transmit and receive characteristics [ 171 , 172 ] .
similarly , developments in cardiac 7t coil design may boost the field of coronary imaging by exploiting the increase in snr for obtaining higher spatial resolution [ 173 ]. fig. 10 comparison of post - contrast intracranial vessel wall imaging using 3t and 7t mri .
7t mri largely resulted in enhanced vessel wall delineation ( due to enhanced csf suppression ) and more frequent detection of atherosclerotic lesions that were missed at 3t ( rows 3 and 4 ) .
depicted are the right proximal artery ( row 1 ) , left proximal vertebral artery ( rows 2 and 3 ) and m1 segment of the middle cerebral artery ( row 4 ) .

[ 18 ] advanced reconstruction techniques quantitative imaging generally comes with the need to acquire multiple images , either having different sensitivity to the parameter of interest ( t1 , t2 , adc ) or sampling a dynamic process over time ( dce , flow ) .
long acquisition times are therefore one of the big hurdles in this field , and complicate the translation of such methods to a clinical environment .
what may be able to change this in the near future is the rapid improvements in reconstruction and post - processing techniques .
in recent years , mathematics has played an increasingly important role in advancing mri technology .
in particular , the introduction of " compressed sensing " has taught us that images can be reconstructed with far less data than was considered necessary using assumptions of image sparsity in combination with iterative reconstruction algorithms [ 174 ] .
as this is quite a generally applicable concept , many researchers have already experimented with compressed sensing to improve vessel wall mri .
for example , 3d msde acquisitions were accelerated to a factor of 5 without significant deviations in assessing vessel wall or plaque component dimensions [ 175 , 176 ] .
gong et al. realized that multi - contrast vessel wall mri could be significantly accelerated by assuming significant shareable information between the different contrast acquisitions [ 177 ] .
the use of their proposed reconstruction algorithm allowed for highly accelerated t2w and pdw scans ( up to a factor of 6 ) once a moderately accelerated t1w scan ( e.g. using sense ) was available .
using regular cs techniques , yuan et al. reduced a 3d msde - based t2 mapping protocol to a clinically acceptable imaging time of 7 min [ 178 ] ; reconstruction of separate images was done independently .
a more promising technique related to quantitative relaxation time ( t1 / t2 ) mapping are model - based algorithms that use prior knowledge of the relaxation equations to reconstruct undersampled scans at multiple inversion or echo times [ 179 , 180 ] for dynamic or time - resolved imaging , temporal relations between images are used in order to achieve high undersampling factors for the individual time frames .
this technique shows great promise for achieving higher - temporal - resolution 3d dce imaging [ 86 ] or allowing interleaved sampling of black - and bright - blood images for the simultaneous measurement of the arterial input function and vessel wall signal response [ 106 ] .
for 4d flow applications , the use of k - t grappa has enabled acceleration factors of up to 5 without substantial errors in derived wss parameters [ 181 ] .
perhaps the greatest benefit of freely undersampling k - space data is the ability to select the optimal data retrospectively .
this can be used to circumvent the need for cardiac and respiratory gating , without losing scan efficiency , and order the data in the reconstruction process based on available data of cardiac and respiratory motion from either sensors or mr navigators .
using appropriate motion correction algorithms , this even allows for 100 % scan efficiency [ 182 , 183 ] .
recent impressive data from ginami et al .
[ 184 ] showed high - quality coronary vessel wall imaging by making reconstructions using different timings of the acquisition window within the cardiac cycle in order to retrospectively achieve the optimal vessel wall delineation .
multimodal imaging : pet / mri in addition to the development of novel mr methods and contrast mechanisms , the integration of mri with other imaging modalities that interrogate different aspects of plaque physiology is quickly becoming a reality .
as a notable example , the introduction of simultaneous pet / mri systems allows for the seamless combination of anatomical and physiological imaging with mri , and metabolic / functional imaging with pet .
pet is a highly sensitive modality , and has already been extensively validated for quantification of plaque macrophages with 18f - fdg [ 185 , 186 ] .
however , pet is an imaging modality with intrinsically low spatial resolution , and it is traditionally combined with computed tomography ( ct ) for improved anatomical localization .
combining pet with mri instead of ct offers several advantages .
mri provides high - spatial - resolution imaging and better soft tissue contrast than ct , and enables the quantification of several physiological parameters in the vessel wall , as previously described in this review .
the better anatomical definition of mri can be used to apply partial volume and motion corrections to improve the localization of the pet signal [ 187 , 188 ] .
last but not least , combining pet with mri instead of ct reduces patient exposure to ionizing radiation - - a highly desirable feature for longitudinal , repeated imaging in patients with chronic diseases ( such as atherosclerosis ) .
the fact that the two modalities are intrinsically co - registered allows for easier image interpretation , image analysis and experimental design [ 188 , 189 ] .
however , there are also specific challenges that may arise when combining these two modalities , such as the effective conversion of mr images to accurate pet attenuation maps , which are still the subject of active investigation [ 189 ] .

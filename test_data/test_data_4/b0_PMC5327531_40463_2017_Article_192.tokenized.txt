background the residency match is an important event in an aspiring physician 's career .
otolaryngology - head and neck surgery ( otl - hns ) is a surgical specialty that has enjoyed high numbers of applicants to its residency programs .
however , recent trends in canada show a decline in first - choice applicants to several surgical fields .
factors thought to influence a medical student 's choice include role models , career opportunities and work - life balance .
the notion of perceived competitiveness is a factor that has not yet been explored .
this study sought to compare competitiveness of otl - hns , as perceived by canadian medical students to residency match statistics published yearly by carms ( canadian residency matching service ) , with the hope of informing future decisions of surgical residency programs .
methods an electronic survey was created and distributed to all medical students enrolled in the 17 canadian medical schools .
after gathering demographic information , students were asked to rank what they perceived to be the five most competitive disciplines offered by carms .
they were also asked to rank surgical specialties from most to least competitive .
publically available data from carms was then collected and analyzed to determine actual competitiveness of admissions to canadian otl - hns residency programs .
results 1194 students , from first to fourth year of medical school , completed the survey .
carms statistics over the period from 2008 to 2014 demonstrated that the five most competitive specialties were plastic surgery , dermatology , ophthalmology , emergency medicine and otl - hns .
among surgical disciplines , otl - hns was third most competitive , where on average 72 % of students match to their first - choice discipline .
when students were questioned , 35 % ranked otl - hns amongst the top five most competitive .
on the other hand 72 % , 74 % and 80 % recognized opthalmology , dermatology and plastic surgery as being among the five most competitive , respectively .
we found that fourth - year medical students were significantly more knowledgeable about the competitiveness of both otl - hns and plastic surgery compared to first - year students ( p < 0.01 ) .
conclusion overall , canadian medical students may underestimate the competitiveness of otl - hns .
furthermore , competitiveness would appear to be a concept that resonates with medical students during the match process .
keywords competitiveness residency match medical education issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background the residency match is widely considered one of the most important events in an aspiring physician 's career .
many factors have been shown to influence a medical student 's choice of residency program , including presence of positive role models , long - term career opportunities , perceived work - life balance , heaviness of call schedule , academic and research opportunities , and length of post - graduate training [ 1 - 12 ] .
to varying degrees , these considerations can either attract or deter students from applying to certain residency programs .
otolaryngology - head and neck surgery ( otl - hns ) is a surgical specialty that , historically , has enjoyed high numbers of applicants to its residency programs .
however , first - choice applicants to this discipline in canada have declined recently , mirroring a decline experienced in other surgical disciplines .
national data from the canadian residency matching service ( carms ) , for the period of 2002 - 2007 compared to 2008 - 2013 , showed a 16.1 % decline in first - choice applicants to otl - hns , similar to declines seen in neurosurgery ( 23.1 %) , urology ( 18.0 %) and plastic surgery ( 15.1 %) [ 13 , 14 ] .
despite this decline , overall otl - hns remains one of the most competitive disciplines offered .
a recent commentary published by kaplan et al. described the possibility that competitiveness in our specialty may affect applications to otl - hns programs .
indeed , they noted that 80 % of boston medical school students described matching to otl - hns as either " impossible " or " near impossible " [ 15 ]. with this in mind , we decided to interrogate canadian medical students , in order to assess their perceptions of otl - hns competitiveness .
to our knowledge , the notion of perceived competitiveness of a specialty as a potential influencing factor has not yet been explored in the medical education literature .
this study sought to determine if canadian medical students over - or under - estimate the competitiveness of otl - hns residency programs as compared to the match statistics published yearly by carms , with the hope that it may inform future decisions of surgical residency programs .
methods ethics , consent and permissions mcgill university 's institutional review board granted ethical approval for this study .
in addition , written consent was obtained from carms to quote their online statistics .
perceived competitiveness an electronic cross - sectional survey was created by the research team , with the aim of exploring canadian medical students' perceptions of competitiveness in applying to otl - hns residency programs .
the survey was created through the questionpro software , was accessible both in english and french , and was entitled " competitiveness of canadian residency programs " .
the title was left intentionally broad in order not to highlight the otl - hns focus and to diminish any potential bias .
participation in the survey was purely voluntary , all responses were kept strictly anonymous , and participants could withdraw from the study at any time .
students were required to fill an online informed consent form prior to gaining access to the survey .
the e - survey was distributed via facebook to all medical students ( year one to four ) enrolled in any of 17 canadian medical schools .
contact was made with each medical school , which then posted the survey link onto its class' common facebook page .
the schools contacted can be found in appendix 1 .
the survey was published on november 10th , 2014 and was closed on february 25th , 2015 .
the survey captured basic demographic information from participants ( i.e. age , gender , level of training ) .
students were asked to rank what they perceived to be the five most competitive disciplines offered by carms ( chosen from an alphabetically ordered list of all specialties available ) .
finally , students were asked to consider only surgical specialties , and to rank them from most to least competitive .
the designation of a specialty as " surgical " was predetermined as posted on the carms website .
the exception was obstetrics and gynecology , which was included as a surgical specialty for the purposes of our study ( due to the large technical skills component ) despite not being considered a surgical subspecialty by carms .
actual competitiveness publically available data from the carms website was collected and analyzed to determine actual competitiveness of admissions to canadian otl - hns residency programs in comparison to other surgical and non - surgical specialties .
the following data points were collected for the period between 2008 and 2014 : total number of applicants ; applicants to that discipline only ; number of students for whom the discipline was the first choice ; number of students matching to their first choice discipline ; quota per program , and unfilled positions per program [ 14 ] .
competitiveness was defined as the percentage of first - choice applicants gaining entry into their discipline of choice .
data analysis descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative portion of the survey .
the difference in accuracy of the competitiveness of otl - hns was examined using a chi - square test .
a p - value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significance .
the data was computed using medcalc version 12.2 .
results the survey was begun by 1788 students , and fully completed by 1194 students .
demographic information is summarized in table 1 .
there are approximately 11 , 500 medical students in canada , indicating an estimated response rate of 10.4 % .
table 1 currently enrolled year of medical school , gender , highest level of prior education of survey respondents year of medical school first 13.1 % second 26.0 % third 19.1 % fourth 41.8 % gender male 40.6 % female 58.5 % education prior to medical school pre - med 15.6 % undergraduate degree 63.8 % master 's degree 14.4 % doctoral degree 2.3 % other 3.8 % projected career choice family medicine 20.3 % internal medicine 11.6 % surgerical discipline 22.3 % otolaryngology ( n = 40 ) 3.0 % not sure 11.6 % actual competitiveness carms statistics over the period from 2008 to 2014 show that the five most competitive specialties were plastic surgery , dermatology , ophthalmology , emergency medicine and otl - hns ( fig. 1 ) [ 14 ] .
furthermore , when we examined the ten surgical disciplines , we found that otl - hns was third most competitive , where on average , only 72 % of students match to their first - choice discipline [ 14 ] .
urology had a very similar match rate to otl - hns , and plastic surgery and ophthalmology consistently had lower match rates ( fig. 2 ) [ 14 ]. fig. 1 all disciplines : average percentage of medical students matching to their first choice discipline ( 2008 - 2014 ) fig. 2 surgical disciplines : average percentage of medical students matching to their first choice surgical discipline ( 2008 - 2014 ) perceived competitiveness our first question to students after gathering demographic information was : " in your opinion , what are the top five most competitive residency disciplines ?
please rank in order ( 1st most competitive , 2nd most competitive etc. )" students then had access to a list of the 32 residency disciplines are offered by carms yearly through an alphabetically ordered drop - down menu .
in total , 35 % ranked otl - hns amongst the top five most competitive .
on the other hand 72 % , 74 % and 80 % recognized opthalmology , dermatology and plastic surgery as being among the five most competitive , respectively .
the second question we asked was : " please rank the following ten surgical disciplines from 1 ( most competitive ) to 10 ( least competitive )" .
students then had access to a list of the ten disciplines and had to give a numerical value to each specialty from 1 to 10 .
table 2 summarizes the results .
plastic surgery received the average score closest to 1 ( most competitive ) , and otl - hns was perceived as third most competitive with the third highest average score of 4.8 .
table 2 average ranking of perceived most competitive surgical discipline based on a 10 point likert scale ( 1 = most competitive , 10 = least competitive ) surgical discipline average score plastic surgery 2.4 ophthalmology 3.2 otl - hns 4.8 neurosurgery 5.0 vascular surgery 6.2 urology 6.3 cardiac surgery 6.4 orthopedic surgery 6.6 general surgery 7.0 obstetrics and gynecology 7.0 finally , we compared the accuracy of assessments based on different demographic information .
we found that fourth - year medical students were significantly more knowledgeable about the competitiveness of both otl - hns and plastic surgery compared to first - year students ( p < 0.01 ) .
a complete comparison of the accuracy of first to fourth year medical students in predicting the competitiveness of different specialties can be found in table 3 .
females were also more likely to have an accurate notion of the competitiveness of otl - hns ( p < 0.01 ) .
we found no significant difference between undergraduate and master 's students ( p = 0.89 ) .
students interested in otl - hns were significantly more aware of its competitiveness compared to students interested in family medicine ( p < 0.01 ) .
table 3 accuracy in rating between first and fourth year medical students discipline year % of students aware that this discipline was ranked top 5 overall p - value otl - hns med 1 18 % < 0.001 med 4 37 % ophthalmology med 1 77 % 0.082 med 4 69 % dermatology med 1 77 % 0.096 med 4 70 % er med 1 33 % 0.194 med 4 38 % plastic surgery med 1 48 % < 0.001 med 4 76 % discussion in both canada and the united states , securing a residency spot is not an easy feat .
however , recent data demonstrates that overall , number of applicants to many canadian surgical discipline are declining [ 13 ] .
our study attempted to quantify perceptions of the competiveness of otl - hns in canada , with one question in mind : could this be affecting the application rates ?
to our knowledge , this is the first study in the literature to explore the notion of perceived competitiveness of a specialty .
overall , only 35 % of canadian medical students identified otl - hns as being among the five most competitive specialties overall .
we found that knowledge of the competitiveness of surgical specialties was shown to increase with years of study .
there was a statistically significant increase in accuracy of predicting the competitiveness of both otl - hns and plastic surgery from year one to year four of medical school .
multiple studies have attempted to understand factors that attract and deter students from applying to surgical fields .
an early study tried to identify elements influencing medical students' career choices and found that strong role models and academic opportunities attracted students to surgical disciplines [ 12 ] .
it also found that lifestyle ; time commitment and call schedules were likely to deter students from a career in surgery .
other factors attracting students to surgical disciplines , as identified in the literature , were resident interactions , number of cases observed in the operating room ( or ) , and a feeling of involvement in the or [ 1 , 3 , 9 ] .
a survey by sutton et al , found that " interest in the specialty " and " work - life balance " were key factors determining decisions [ 9 ] .
despite all these factors , none of the previously mentioned studies raised the subject of perceived competitiveness .
indeed , we found that among students questioned only one in three students was aware that otl - hns was ranked among the top five most competitive disciplines overall .
this is different than the study by kaplan et al. in the united states which showed that students were extremely aware of the difficulty of matching to this specialty [ 15 ] .
we hypothesize that this lack of awareness could be due to a lack of exposure to the specialty .
certain specialties , such as general surgery , are mandatory for all students at clerkship level .
on the other hand , specialties such as otl - hns and urology are usually only offered as electives in most canadian medical schools .
it could be hypothesized that this may explain the lack of awareness of competitiveness of both surgical disciplines .
until recently , medical students had very little exposure to these specialties outside of selective rotations .
previous research in plastic surgery has posited that insufficient exposure is contributing to the decline in number of applicants [ 16 ]. with an increased emphasis on undergraduate medical education curriculum development in otl - hns [ 17 ] , more students may have an opportunity to explore this specialty .
this rise in exposure may influence the volume of applicants to otl - hns .
despite the aforementioned benefits , there are a few limitations of this study .
our sample , although large , may not fully represent the entire population of canadian medical students .
although we had respondents from every school , some schools had fewer respondents .
another limitation of our study was the definition of the word " competitiveness " , which we defined as percentage of applicants matching to their first - choice discipline .
the competitiveness of a specialty , however , depends on multiple factors .
the present questionnaire cannot assess whether competitiveness attracts or deters a student to pursue otl - hns , but it does highlight the fact that canadian medical students may underestimate the competitiveness of the specialty .
competitiveness would appear to be a concept that resonates with medical students during the match process .
to our knowledge , this is the first study that attempts to quantify perceived competitiveness of residency programs .
in light of the recent decline in application rates , this work may help inform surgical educators and program directors to best promote their specialty to undergraduate medical learners .
conclusion two - thirds of canadian medical students are unaware that otl - hns ranks among the five most competitive specialties overall .
however , students were accurate in assessing how competitive otl - hns was compared to other surgical disciplines .
a lack of exposure in undergraduate medical training may influence the overall awareness of the competitiveness of otl - hns .
future research is needed to assess whether perceived competitiveness is contributing to the decline in applications to surgical disciplines .

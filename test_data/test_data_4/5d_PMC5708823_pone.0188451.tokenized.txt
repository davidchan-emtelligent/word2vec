aim to evaluate the caries prevalence and related variables in type 1 diabetic and non - diabetic children and among the diabetic children according to their metabolic status .
methods sixty - eight diabetic and 136 non - diabetic children , matching by gender and age ( 4 - 14 years ) were enrolled .
the diabetic children were divided : a ) 20 children in good metabolic control ( hb1ac <= 7.5 ) and b ) 48 children in bad metabolic control ( hb1ac > 7.5 ) .
dietary and oral hygiene habits were investigated .
caries status was registered using the international caries detection and assessment system .
oral microflora was analysed using the checkerboard dna - dna hybridisation method .
plaque acidogenicity was recorded after a sucrose rinse .
results sugared beverage and snack intake was higher in diabetic group compared to non - diabetic group ( p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 , respectively ) and in subjects in bad metabolic control ( p = 0.03 and p < 0.01 , respectively ) .
oral hygiene habits were similar , except for the use of fluoridated adjuvants , higher in non - diabetic children ( p = 0.04 ) .
no statistically significant differences were observed regarding caries figures , but a higher number of caries free subjects was found in diabetic subjects in good metabolic control ( p < 0.01 ) .
significant difference for the main cariogenic bacteria was found between diabetic and non - diabetic subjects ( p < 0.05 ) .
the ph values showed statistically significant differences between diabetic and non - diabetic subjects and between diabetic subjects in good and bad metabolic control ( p < 0.01 ) .
conclusions diabetic children in good metabolic control might even be considered at low caries risk , while those in bad metabolic control showed an oral environment prone to a high caries risk .

introduction diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease resulting from a relative or absolute deficiency of insulin , which affects the metabolism of carbohydrate , protein , and fat [ 1 ] .
finland , sardinia ( italy ) and sweden are known to have the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes in the world [ 2 - 6 ] .
tailored dietary advices are given to children and their families about the amount , type and distribution of carbohydrate to include in main meals and snacks ( if appropriate ) during the day to promote optimal growth and blood glucose control [ 7 ] .
nutrition education and lifestyle counseling should be adapted and delivered both to the individual child and family .
while the association between oral health and type 2 diabetes is well recognized [ 8 - 10 ] there is still limited evidence available regarding the association between type 1 diabetes and oral health , even if various oral problems have been reported including an increased presence of caries [ 11 - 13 ] .
dental caries remains one of the most common chronic disease with a dietary - bacterial aetiology [ 14 ] .
caries is characterized by an ecological shift within the dental biofilm environment , driven by frequent access to fermentable dietary carbohydrates , leads to a move from a balanced population of microorganisms of low cariogenicity to a microbiological population of high cariogenicity ( more aciduric and acidogenic ) and to an increased production of organic acids [ 15 ] .
the acid production near the tooth structures produces the demineralization of enamel and dentin and subsequently may evolve in the development of a cavitation [ 16 ] .
unbalanced diabetes is associated with significant cariogenic changes in the oral environment including less resting and stimulated whole saliva , lower saliva buffering capacity and acidic ph , higher salivary glucose , higher salivary albumin concentrations , high proportion of salivary mutans streptococci and yeast [ 11 , 12 , 17 - 19 ] .
changes in the oral microflora of diabetic subject in poor glycemic control may significantly influence the prevalence of gingivitis and caries [ 20 , 21 ] .
however , contrary to previous findings , lower caries experience was also reported [ 22 , 23 ] .
no significant differences regarding caries experience between type 1 diabetic and non - diabetic children was described [ 24 ] , even if the number of untreated dental caries was higher among the diabetic children , reflecting a lower dental attendance .
a high caries susceptibility was also reported in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus in poor bad metabolic control [ 18 , 25 , 26 ] .
poor metabolic control is defined as a hba1c level exceeding the target range of hba1c for all age - groups of < 7.5 % ( 58 mmol / mol ) [ 7 ]. from these premises , there is the need to understand the association between type 1 diabetes and oral health , especially caries , that has still a high prevalence in children populations ; this association might be critical for the diabetes long - term management [ 27 ] .
the number of people affected by diabetes in sardinia is estimated in almost 95,000 individuals ( 56 cases / 1000 individuals ) .
in sassari area 1,013 children affected by type 1 diabetes are reported ( 41 cases / 1000 individuals ) [ 28 ] .
to reply to this need , caries experience and caries - related variables between diabetic and non - diabetic children were compared ; a comparison was also performed among the diabetic children according to their metabolic status .
the null - hypothesis was that no difference regarding caries experience between diabetic and non - diabetic children and among diabetic children with differences in the metabolic control would be observed .
material and methods study design and sample the study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the university of sassari , sassari , italy [ authorisation number 133 / 2014 ] and conducted according to the principles of the helsinki declaration ii. the study was conducted from january 2015 to september 2015 .
a cross - sectional case control study ( rate 1:2 matched for age and gender ) was designed .
two categories of subjects were enrolled , diabetic and non - diabetic children ( aged 4 - 14 years old ) .
the criteria necessary for the enrolment into the study were : diabetes diagnosed from more than 2 years [ 7 ] , within 14 years of age , living in sassari and surrounding area , good general health apart from diabetes , reporting to clean teeth at least twice a day .
power analysis was performed before the start of the study using the web - based openepitm platform ( http :// openinfo.com ) , considering a caries prevalence of about 50 % [ 29 ] ; sample size was increased by 20 % bearing in mind a modification in caries prevalence and a high number of non - responders .
the number of diabetic children needs to be enrolled was fixed in 64 with an actual power of 0.95 .
information about the study program was mailed to 225 parents / guardians of 75 diabetic and 150 non - diabetic children , asking the consent for their child to participate into the study .
seventy - two diabetic children agree to participate and 68 were enrolled , while from the group of 150 non - diabetic children selected , 136 subjects , matching by gender and age were also enrolled .
the diabetic children were divided into two subgroups according to data from their medical charts : a ) 20 children with a good metabolic control ( hb1ac <= 7.5 ) and b ) 48 children with bad metabolic control ( hb1ac > 7.5 ) [ 30 , 31 ] .
questionnaire a limited checklist of 19 foods and beverages ( sugar - sweetened beverages , savoury snacks and sweets ) with a frequency response section was parents / self - administered to the subjects to report how often each item was consumed over a specified period [ 32 , 33 ] .
the oral hygiene habits were investigated by questions on regular use and frequency of toothbrushing , use of fluoridated toothpaste , use of others fluoridated products and , frequency of dental attendance [ 34 ] .
clinical examination the clinical examination was made under optimal lighting using a mirror and a world - health - organization probe .
the who probe has a coloured band ( called the reference marking ) located 3.5 - 5.5 mm from the probe tip .
for caries registration , the international caries detection and assessment system ( icdas ) [ 35 ] index was used .
no radiographs for caries diagnosis were used [ 36 ] .
for the diabetic children , data on their medical condition was also retrieved from their medical charts .
saliva samples and microbiological analyses all subjects were instructed not to brush their teeth or to eat / drink during one hour prior to the oral examination .
saliva sample was collected using paraffin gum during 5 min with continuously spitting into a test tube after 60 sec of pre - stimulation chewing one piece of paraffin [ 37 ] .
younger children were instructed on the collection procedure and followed during the test , inviting them repeatedly to spit during the 5 minutes of chewing .
the saliva samples were sent to department of microbiology , university of bologna for evaluation of oral microflora .
the microbiological analysis was made using the checkerboard dna - dna hybridisation method [ 38 ] .
whole genomic probes were matched from 15 bacterial strains ( streptococcus mutans , streptococcus sobrinus , streptococcus criceti , streptococcus downei , streptococcus ferus , streptococcus macacae , streptococcus ratti , streptococcus infantis , streptococcus mitis , streptococcus gordoni , lactobacillus salivarius , streptococcus sanguinis , streptococcus salivarius , lactobacillus casei , lactobacillus fermentum ) known to be associated with caries .
matching the obtained signals with the ones generated by the pooled standard samples , containing a count of 106 and 105 of each bacterial species , respectively , an evaluation of the bacterial count was performed in the samples .
plaque acidogenicity immediately after the saliva sampling , the plaque acidogenicity was assessed using the ph indicator strips in the interproximal space in 2 sites : 1 ) between the first and the second maxillary primary molars right and left in the younger children or 2 ) between the 2nd primary molar and 1st maxillary molar right and left in the older children .
the strips measure a ph value in the range of 4.0 - 7.0 ( spezialindikator , ph range 4.0 - 7.0 ; merck , darmstadt , germany ) [ 39 ] .
each strip was cut into 4 pieces ( approx. 2 mm in width ) to get a strip that more easily could be inserted into the interproximal space .
the strip was held in situ for 10 s after which it was removed and its colour compared to the colour index scheme supplied by the manufacturer .
the ph was determined to one decimal of the value .
for each site , 3 measurements were carried out .
measurements were performed before ( 0 min ) and at 2 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 and 30 min after a mouth rinse with 10 % sucrose for 1 - min .
statistical analyses all the data were input into a spreadsheet ( microsoft excel ( r ) 2011 for mac , version 14.4.3 ) .
statistical analyses were performed using stata / se ( r ) software , version 13.1 for mac ( 64 - bit intel ( r )) .
regarding questionnaire items , subjects were asked to choose from seven options ranging from never ( zero intake ) to more than four times per day and a score was given to each option ( i.e. never or zero intake = 0 , once a week = 1 etc. ) .
the scores were then added for each participant as sugared beverage intake total score and sugared snack intake total score .
data from the dental clinical examinations were grouped as follows : healthy / caries - free ( icdas 0 ) , initial ( caries in enamel icdas 1 - 2 ) , moderate ( caries not cavitated icdas 3 - 4 ) , and severe ( cavitated caries in dentin icdas 5 - 6 ) .
data from microbiological analysis was coded on a scale from 0 to 5 : 0 = no signal ; 1 = a signal density weaker than that of the low standard (< 105 bacteria ) ; 2 = a signal density equal to that of the low standard (= 105 bacteria ) ; 3 = a signal density higher than that of the low standard but lower than that of the high standard (> 105 but < 106 bacteria ) ; 4 = a signal density equal to that of the high standard (= 106 bacteria ) and 5 = a signal density higher than that of the high standard (> 106 bacteria ) .
the mean plaque ph (+/ - standard error ) for all subjects at the different time points was calculated for the two interproximal sites .
the maximum ph fall and minimum ph after the sucrose rinse were calculated for each subject .
the ph curve , as the area below the critical ph of enamel ( auc5.7 ) and of dentine ( auc6.2 ) was also calculated [ 40 ] .
comparisons of the different variables were made between the diabetic and non - diabetic subjects and between diabetic subjects in good metabolic control and in bad metabolic control .
all data was analysed univariately to describe the variables and distributions .
student t test between the two groups was calculated , and p < 0.05 was considered as a significant level .
to avoid the attenuating effect of unequal variability among groups on the value of t , a square root transformation was performed when the response variable was a count .
one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was performed for means comparison between diabetic subjects in good metabolic control , in bad metabolic control , and non - diabetic subjects .
moreover , a two - way table analysis ( chi - square ) was conducted to determine the association between diabetic and non - diabetic subjects and frequency of outcomes from the questionnaire items .
if a cell contained a value less than five the fisher 's exact test was calculated .
result gender distribution was 33 males and 35 females in the diabetic group and exactly the double in the non - diabetic group ; the mean age of the sample was similar in both groups ( 12.11 + 2.77 in diabetic group and 12.09 + 2.68 in non - diabetic group ) .
diet and oral hygiene habits sugared beverage and snack scores were significantly statistically higher in diabetic group compared to non - diabetic group ( p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 , respectively ) ; the scores were even higher in diabetic subjects in bad metabolic control respect to those in good metabolic control ( p < 0.01 for sugared beverage and p = 0.03 for snacks ) ( table 1 ) .

microbiological analyses no difficulties were found in the saliva collection even for the younger children since the sample procedure was proposed as a game .
the association between bacteria strains and diabetic and non - diabetic subjects is displayed in table 3 .
the bacteria strains were categorized in primary cariogenic bacteria ( s. mutans , s. sobrinus , others mutans streptococci , l. casei , l. fermentum ) and not primary cariogenic bacteria ( s. sanguinis , s. salivarius , s. mitis , s. gordonii , l. salivarius ) .

discussion the present study was carried out in order to evaluate the caries figure and the different caries - related variables between type 1 diabetic and non - diabetic children and among diabetic children according to their metabolic status .
the main outcome was that the oral environment in diabetic population was more prone to caries compared to non - diabetic population even if the caries figures were not statistically significant different , data consistent with the results of previous studies [ 41 ] .
as in non - diabetic population , in diabetic group a skewed caries distribution was evident .
on the other hand , several authors [ 11 , 42 ] reported a lower prevalence of caries in diabetic group than in non - diabetic population .
in this study , a statistically significant higher caries figures were observed in diabetic subjects in bad metabolic control compare to those in good metabolic control .
this finding might be linked to several factors like as a higher sugared snack and beverage intake , a non - optimal fluoride exposure , a more cariogenic microbial flora and lower plaque ph values .
a higher intake of sugared snacks and beverages was recorded in the diabetic children compared to non - diabetic ; this difference was indeed mostly related to diabetic group in bad metabolic control , since diabetic subjects in good metabolic control reported a sugared foods intake even lower than non - diabetic subjects .
international clinical guidelines on the management of type 1 diabetes call for a healthy diet [ 43 ] .
the glycemic control may be improved by increasing the intake of foods with low glycemic index [ 44 ] .
low carbohydrate ( 30 % - 40 % energy rate ) and very low carbohydrate diets ( 21 - 70 g / d ) are recommended for the management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes , respectively in order to control glycemic values [ 45 ] .
the higher intake of sugared foods recorded in a sub - group of diabetic children might be considered a risk factor related to the bad glycemic control and the higher caries figures recorded .
although the regular use of fluoride toothpaste is considered a cornerstone in dental health , producing the dramatic decline of the caries prevalence during the last decades of the 20th century in western countries [ 46 ] , it might be not sufficient to prevent caries lesions in high risk subjects .
in this study , no statistically significant differences were recorded about the use of fluoride toothpaste between diabetic and non - diabetic children ; nevertheless considering others fluoridated adjuvants i.e. fluoride mouthrinse and tablets , a statistically significant difference was found , since diabetic children reported a less frequent use of fluoridated preventive products , contributing to explain the worse clinical situation .
in addition , although all children declared to brush their teeth twice a day , the reported duration of the brushing considered effective for a good dental hygiene (>= 2 minutes ) was statistically significant higher in diabetic group in good metabolic control compared to diabetic in bad metabolic control and non - diabetic group .
this finding might also contribute to explain the caries figure in the studied populations [ 47 ] .
modern concepts regard caries as an interaction among biological , social , behavioural and psychological factors with the dental biofilm as the key element [ 16 ] .
if a diet rich in fermentable carbohydrates is maintained , prolonged acidic conditions on the tooth surface become frequent and more aciduric bacteria become dominant through acid - induced selection [ 48 ] .
early acquisition of mutans streptococci is considered one of the key elements in the development of early childhood caries and a predictable factor of future caries .
another important caries - associated microorganism is lactobacillus species , which colonised carious lesions later than mutans streptococci [ 49 ] .
otherwise , the presence in the dental biofilm of some bacterial species as s. sanguinis , s. salivarius , s. mitis and others streptoccus spp. as well as lactobacillus spp. may moderate caries lesion development in children [ 50 ] .
in the present study different strains of streptococcus and lactobacillus spp. were investigated .
regarding cariogenic bacteria the findings show a higher prevalence of caries - associated pathogens ( s. mutans and s. sobrinus ) in diabetic children compared to non - diabetic children and this difference increased when diabetic children in bad metabolic control were compared to non - diabetic children .
in a recent paper , accordingly to our results , mutans streptococci were considered a significant variable affecting caries experience in diabetic children [ 19 ] .
no differences in the distribution or number of mutans streptococci between type 1 diabetic and non - diabetic children were also recorded [ 51 ] .
in the same study significantly lower levels of lactobacilli were found among the diabetic children .
this finding is in agreement with our results since l. casei and l. fermentum showed statistically significant lower concentrations in diabetic than in non - diabetic children .
this finding is probably related to the higher intake of sugared beverages and snacks reported by diabetic children in bad metabolic control .
stephan - curve was also recorded after a sugar challenge and minimum ph , maximum ph fall , and auc6.2 and auc5.7 were evaluated .
since they were firstly described , ph parameters have been frequently used for the evaluation of food cariogenicity and / or individual caries risk status [ 52 ] .
findings showed a more acidogenic environment in diabetic subjects compared to non - diabetic group .
differences were also recorded between diabetic children in bad and good metabolic control : all ph parameters were more prone to caries risk in children in bad metabolic control than in good .
despite the study limitations , primarily the subjects sampled from a limited geographical area , a longitudinal clinical evaluation of the study participants might led to an increase of information on the oral health status of the diabetic young patients .
both diabetes and caries are complex multifactorial diseases .
these results underline that , even if it is difficult to separate specific effects of diabetes - induced changes on the caries process , caries and diabetes recognize diet as a main risk factor in the disease management .
based on this study 's results , the following conclusions can be summarized : diabetic subjects in good metabolic control might even be considered at low caries risk , since they show an oral environment less prone to caries risk compared to non - diabetic population .
otherwise , diabetic subjects in bad metabolic control showed a worse oral environment and are at high risk of caries .

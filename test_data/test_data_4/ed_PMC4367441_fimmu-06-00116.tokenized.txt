clinical and diagnostic laboratories often encounter patient sera containing antinuclear antibodies ( anas ) that produce a nuclear dense fine speckled immunofluorescence pattern on hep - 2 cells .
these autoantibodies usually target the dense fine speckled protein of 70 kda ( dfs70 ) , commonly known as lens epithelium - derived growth factor p75 ( ledgfp75 ) .
anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies have recently attracted much interest because of their relatively common occurrence in sera from patients with positive ana tests with no clinical evidence of systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease ( sard ) .
their presence has been documented primarily in patients with diverse non - sard inflammatory conditions and " apparently healthy " individuals .
while there is circumstantial evidence that depending on the context these autoantibodies could play protective , pathogenic , or sensor roles , their significance remains elusive .
dfs70 / ledgfp75 has emerged during the past decade as a stress transcription co - activator relevant to hiv integration , cancer , and inflammation .
it is not clear , however , what makes this protein the target of such a common autoantibody response .
we suggest that a better understanding of dfs70 / ledgfp75 biology is key to elucidating the significance of its associated autoantibodies .
here , we discuss briefly our current understanding of this enigmatic autoantigen and potential scenarios leading to its targeting by the immune system .
autoantibodies ledgfp75 autoantigens hiv cancer autoimmunity dfs70 nihp20md006988 introduction the clinical and biological significance of anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies has been puzzling because in spite of being relatively common and capable of reaching high titers , they lack disease specificity and can be found in " apparently healthy " individuals and in patients with diverse non - sard inflammatory conditions ( 1 - 7 ) .
these autoantibodies are present at very low frequencies in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease ( sard ) , and their prevalence appears to be higher in " apparently healthy " individuals than in these patients ( 1 , 4 - 7 ) .
when present in sard patients , these autoantibodies are usually accompanied by other sard - specific autoantibodies ; however , when present as the sole antinuclear antibody ( ana ) specificity they tend to exclude a sard diagnosis ( 5 - 7 ) .
this led to the hypothesis that anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies could be useful biomarkers to exclude a sard diagnosis , and an algorithm for their clinical utility has been developed ( 3 , 6 , 7 ) .
these unique features have recently attracted much attention , and vigorous efforts to uncover the significance of this autoantigen - autoantibody system are currently underway in several laboratories and clinics around the world .
anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies are usually detected in standard hep - 2 substrates by indirect immunofluorescence ( iif ) microscopy .
they are characterized by staining of dense fine speckles ( dfs ) in the nucleoplasm of cells in interphase , typically excluding the nucleolus , with bright staining of metaphase chromosomes in mitotic cells ( figure 1a ) .
confirmation of the specificity of the dfs - iif pattern for dfs70 / ledgfp75 can be achieved by examining the sera for reactivity with a protein band of approximately 70 - 75 kda in immunoblots of cell lysates that express high levels of this protein such as cancer cells ( 8 , 9 ) ( figure 1b ) .
other detection platforms include elisa and chemiluminescence immunoassays such as the quanta flash - dfs70 ( inova diagnostics ) .

( c ) diagram depicting the main structural domains and motifs of dfs70 / ledgfp75 with their proposed functions .
distinguishing anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies from other common anas could be challenging because if examined by non - expert interpreters in hep - 2 substrates , they could be confused with other nuclear iif patterns ( 6 ) .
this , combined with the use of single antibody detection assays , has led to inter - laboratory variability in reports of the frequencies of anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies in different populations and patient cohorts .
confusing the dfs - iif pattern with other ana patterns may lead to inaccurate immunodiagnosis of sard , with ensuing negative consequences for the antibody - positive individuals .
therefore , there is growing consensus that the ana test should not be used as the sole method for the detection of anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies , and that confirmatory tests are needed until a highly accurate immunoassay for the detection of these antibodies is developed and well - validated in multiple laboratories .
our functional and structural understanding of dfs70 / ledg fp75 , also known as transcription co - activator p75 and pc4 and sfrs1 interacting protein 1 ( psip1 ) , has dramatically increased since its discovery in the late 1990s .
this has led to its emergence as a stress response transcription co - activator of growing relevance to human disease , including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) , cancer , and diverse inflammatory conditions ( 8 - 11 ) .
however , in spite of the growing knowledge on dfs70 / ledgfp75 biology , we are still perplexed by the relatively common autoantibody response to this protein among ana - positive patients who have no clinical evidence of sard .
as briefly discussed below , we believe that integrating our growing knowledge of this dfs70 / ledgfp75 with the emerging observations on the clinical contexts in which its associated autoantibodies arise will help uncover the significance of this autoantigen - autoantibody system .
dfs70 / ledgfp75 structure , expression , and functions dfs70 / ledgfp75 is a multi - functional protein with well - defined domains ( figure 1c ) .
its n - terminal portion encompasses chromatin - binding elements such as a proline - tryptophan - tryptophan - proline ( pwwp ) domain , charged regions ( cr ) , at - hook motifs , and a nuclear localization signal ( nls ) .
all these sequences cooperate to facilitate dfs70 / ledgfp75 binding to active transcription sites in the chromatin , where it interacts with rna polymerase - ii transcription complexes to regulate stress gene expression .
the c - terminal portion encompasses a highly conserved , conformational , and functional domain that contains the epitope targeted by the autoantibodies ( residues 349 - 435 ) ( figure 1c ) ( 12 ) .
to date , the functions associated with the c - terminal portion of dfs70 / ledgfp75 include transcriptional activity , stress survival activity , and serving as a hub for specific protein - protein interactions ( figure 1c ) .
the immune targeting of this functionally important and highly conserved c - terminal portion of dfs70 / ledgfp75 is consistent with the generalized notion that ana - defined epitopes typically comprise highly conserved , conformation dependent , functioning sites .
dfs70 / ledgfp75 has a short spliced variant designated ledgfp52 that corresponds to its n - terminal residues 1 - 325 plus eight , intron - derived , unique residues 326 - 333 [ reviewed in ref. ( 10 )] .
ledgfp52 is typically not targeted by the autoantibodies and plays roles in transcription and mrna splicing .
we observed that when overexpressed in cancer cells ledgfp52 induces apoptosis and antagonizes the transcriptional activity of dfs70 / ledgfp75 [ reviewed in ref. ( 10 )] .
although originally presumed to be a lens epithelial cell ( lec ) growth factor , compelling evidence indicates that this autoantigen may not be a growth factor but rather a stress response protein that is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and tissues , with overexpression in cancer cells and tumors ( 8 - 10 , 13 ) .
the human protein atlas lists the psip1 / ledgf gene as moderately or highly expressed , both at the transcript and protein levels , in 80 of 81 non - cancerous tissues analyzed ( http :// www.proteinatlas.org ) .
this tissue expression analysis , however , does not distinguish between the p75 and p52 splice variants .
dfs70 / ledgfp75 plays a key role in promoting cell survival in the face of environmental stressors such as alcohol , uvb irradiation , serum starvation , and certain viruses and cytotoxic drugs ( 9 , 10 , 13 , 14 ) .
ultimately , these stressors lead to increased cellular oxidative stress , resulting in dfs70 / ledgfp75 activation .
the stress survival functions of dfs70 / ledgfp75 are linked to its ability to transcriptionally activate stress protective , antioxidant , and inflammatory genes ( 10 , 13 , 14 ) .
dfs70 / ledgfp75 contributes to the activation of these genes by forming complexes with multiple chromatin - associated proteins .
both the n - and c - terminal portions of dfs70 / ledgfp75 participate in its transcription and stress survival functions .
the ability of dfs70 / ledgfp75 to preserve the structural integrity of vital cellular organelles such as the lysosome points to a critical role for this protein in regulating cellular life and death decisions in response to stress [ reviewed in ref. ( 10 )] .
for additional details on the main cellular functions ascribed to dfs70 / ledgfp75 please refer to table 1 .
table 1 key cellular functions of dfs70 / ledgf / p75 .
function mechanism apoptosis signaling cleaved during apoptosis by caspases into fragments that retain autoepitope and that persist as cells transition from apoptosis to secondary necrosis ; this cleavage abolishes its pro - survival activities cellular stress survival protects mammalian cells against a variety of environmental stressors ( e.g. , uvb , oxidative stress , thermal stress , alcohol , certain drugs ) chemoresistance upregulated in chemoresistant cancer cells ; promotes lysosomal stability in the context of drug - induced caspase - independent cell death chromatin binding facilitated by its pwwp domain , at hooks , and charged regions development knockout associated with skeletal and craniofacial abnormalities possibly due to deficient activation of hox genes dna repair component of homologous recombination repair complex hiv - 1 integration tethers hiv - integrase to transcriptionally active sites to facilitate integration of hiv - 1 inflammation implicated in activation of il6 / stat3 pathway leukemogenesis upregulated in chemoresistant leukemia blasts ; binds to menin - mll transcription complex to activate leukemia - associated genes ; forms fusion proteins with nup98 in some leukemia patients malignant transformation overexpressed in cancer cells and certain solid tumors ; promotes cell survival signaling , proliferation , migration , clonogenicity , angiogenesis , and tumor growth nuclear import mediated by single classical nls protein - protein interactions binds to several chromatin - associated proteins ( e.g. , hiv - in , mecp2 , mll - menin , jpo2 ) through its pwwp and ibd domains transcription interacts with the rna polymerase - ii transcription complex ; contributes to the activation of stress survival , cancer - associated , inflammation , and hox genes ; may also act as repressor depending on context knockout of the psip1 / ledgf gene ( which encodes dfs70 / ledgfp75 and p52 ) in mice , while not embryonically lethal , was associated with craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities that led to premature death in most newborns shortly after birth due to their inability to nurse , possibly because of olfactory dysfunction or motor abnormalities ( 15 ) .
psip / ledgf - / - knockout mice that survived to adulthood displayed motor and behavioral defects , craniofacial abnormalities , and eyelid inflammation .
these abnormalities were associated with dysregulation of hox genes , many of which were significantly upregulated by the loss of the ps1p1 / ledgf gene ( 15 ) .
interestingly , the ps1p1 / ledgf gene has been mapped to chromosome 9p22.2 region , which is adjacent to a locus associated with the 9p deletion syndrome , a rare human chromosomal abnormality characterized by atypical craniofacial features , inability to nurse and breath , eye diseases , and several other anomalies .
it remains to be determined if loss of dfs70 / ledgfp75 is a common genetic abnormality in this syndrome .
dfs70 / ledgfp75 and hiv / aids dfs70 / ledgfp75 is essential for integration of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( hiv - 1 ) , a role that is mediated by its high - affinity interaction with hiv - 1 integrase ( hiv - in ) ( 11 ) .
hiv - in binds to a highly conserved , c - terminal domain of dfs70 / ledgfp75 mapped to residues 347 - 429 and named integrase binding domain ( ibd ) ( 11 ) .
this interaction stabilizes hiv - in and contributes to dfs70 / ledgfp75 - mediated shuttling of hiv - 1 into the nucleus and tethering it to chromatin to promote viral integration to transcriptionally active sites .
this key role in hiv - 1 integration has catapulted dfs70 / ledgfp75 into the limelight of promising candidates for therapeutic targeting in hiv / aids ( 11 ) .
remarkably , the dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoepitope region ( residues 349 - 435 ) is essentially the same region comprised by the ibd ( residues 347 - 429 ) .
while the biological significance of these " coincidental " findings is unclear , they raise intriguing questions .
why would an epitope region targeted by autoantibodies be the same region specifically recognized by the hiv - in ?
what elements within this region make it attractive for targeting by both the immune system and hiv - 1 ?
would the presence of anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies , which may absorb extracellularly released dfs70 / ledgfp75 , protect individuals against hiv infection by preventing this protein from binding to hiv - in ?
studies with cohorts of hiv - positive patients that are susceptible or resistant to develop full - blown aids may provide interesting insights into the possible relationship between the presence of these autoantibodies and disease progression .
dfs70 / ledgfp75 and cancer we reported a significantly higher frequency of autoantibodies to dfs70 / ledgfp75 in prostate cancer patients ( pca ) compared to age - and gender - matched controls [ reviewed in ref. ( 8 , 10 )] .
while several groups have recently confirmed this observation in different pca cohorts , others have not detected higher frequencies of these autoantibodies in cancer patients compared to non - cancer controls ( 5 ) .
it remains to be determined if autoantibodies to dfs70 / ledgfp75 are more prevalent in pca patients than in patients with other cancer types .
toward this goal , it would be important in future studies to determine the frequency of these autoantibodies in large cohorts of patients with different cancer types , individuals at high risk of developing cancer , and matched controls , using a combination of detection methods .
our early observation that dfs70 / ledgfp75 is targeted by autoantibodies in some pca patients is consistent with our more recent studies demonstrating its overexpression , both at the transcript and protein levels , in pca tissues ( 8 ) .
this overexpression has been shown to be statistically significant , typically above a twofold difference compared to non - malignant tissues , and is not restricted to pca since it has been observed in other cancer types ( 8 , 9 ) .
overexpression of dfs70 / ledgfp75 in malignant tissues could be induced by increased inflammation and oxidative stress in the microenvironment of the affected tissue , or by oncogenic viruses such as the human papilloma virus ( hpv ) ( 8 , 9 ) .
a plethora of studies during the past decade by several laboratories has provided compelling evidence that when overexpressed in cancer cells , this autoantigen contributes to the upregulation and activation of a stress protective pathway that promotes tumor aggressive properties such as increased cell proliferation and survival , clonogenicity , migration , angiogenesis , tumor volume , and selective resistance to chemotherapy - induced cell death ( 8 - 10 , 14 ) .
thus , dfs70 / ledgfp75 is now considered an emerging tumor - associated antigen and stress oncoprotein that is relevant to multiple cancer types .
dfs70 / ledgfp75 and eye diseases several studies have reported an association of anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies with diverse inflammatory diseases of the eye including cataracts associated with atopic dermatitis , vogt - koyanagi - harada ( vkh ) disease , sympathetic ophthalmia , behcet 's disease , and atypical retinal degeneration [ reviewed in ref. ( 2 , 10 , 13 )] .
notably , the original cdna encoding the ledgfp75 protein was identified from the screening of a lens epithelium - derived cdna library using a serum from a patient with age - related cataract ( 13 ) .
anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 antibodies ( both human and rabbit ) appear to have cytotoxic properties in lecs grown in vitro , suggesting a pathogenic role for the autoantibodies in the context of eye disease [ reviewed in ref. ( 13 )] .
while the mechanism of cytotoxicity was not clear , it was proposed that the antibodies bind to dfs70 / ledgfp75 released into the extracellular environment , preventing its re - entry into lecs where it acts as a pro - survival factor .
it remains to be established , however , if these cytotoxic properties are specific for lecs since they have not been documented in other cellular or tissue models .
dfs70 / ledgfp75 has been shown to protect eye cells from various environmental stressors through the transcriptional activation of stress genes ( 13 ) .
it would be important , however , to determine in future studies if the humoral response to dfs70 / ledgfp75 in eye diseases or other inflammatory pathologies reflects an aberrant expression or function of this protein in the diseased tissue as a consequence of exposure to environmental stressors .
what are the autoantibodies to dfs70 / ledgfp75 trying to tell us ?
this question , first posed by our group a decade ago ( 2 ) , is still elusive .
in spite of the wealth of information on the biology and clinical associations of the dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibody - autoantigen system that has accumulated during the past 15 years , we still lack a clear understanding of this system .
we suggest , however , that in our quest to elucidate the biological and clinical significance of humoral autoimmunity to anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 , we should take into account the following key observations : ( 1 ) the nuclear dfs - iif pattern produced by anti - dfs70 / ledg fp75 autoantibodies is the most common ana pattern in sera from patients with non - sard diagnosis referred to clinical diagnostic laboratories ( 4 , 5 ) .
( 2 ) anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies can be found in patients with diverse inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis , alopecia areata , interstitial cystitis , asthma , pediatric chronic fatigue syndrome , miscellaneous non - sard autoimmune and inflammatory diseases , eye diseases , and prostate cancer ( 1 - 7 , 10 ). with a few exceptions , their frequency in these non - sard inflammatory conditions usually ranges from 6 to 20 % .
( 3 ) these autoantibodies are typically igg and can circulate at high titers , often reaching 1:5,120 , in some " apparently healthy " individuals who stay healthy after years of follow up ( 6 ) .
this could suggest that they are natural antibodies .
( 4 ) the c - terminal autoepitope targeted by anti - dfs70 / ledg fp75 autoantibodies is a highly conserved , conformational , and functional region that serves as a hub for interactions with several chromatin - associated proteins ( 10 - 12 ) .
( 5 ) dfs70 / ledgfp75 is upregulated in a variety of cells and tissues in response to environmental stressors ( e.g. , uvb , hyperthermia , starvation , viral infections , cytotoxic drugs , etc. ) and promotes cell survival by engaging in multiple complexes in the chromatin and transcriptionally activating stress protective , antioxidant , and inflammation - related genes ( 8 - 10 , 13 , 14 ) .
( 6 ) dfs70 / ledgfp75 is cleaved by caspases during apoptosis into fragments that contain the c - terminal autoepitope ( 2 , 10 ) .
we speculate that aberrant tissue manifestations of this autoantigen ( i.e. , overexpression , extracellular release , cell death cleavage , induction by viruses ) under stressful and pro - inflammatory conditions could alter its immunogenicity , leading to the elicitation of the autoantibodies in susceptible individuals .
for instance , the dynamic functions of the autoepitope domain of dfs70 / ledgfp75 , which include interactions with multiple self - and non - self proteins to form shifting chromatin - associated complexes depending on cellular / molecular context , may influence its immunogenicity under inflammatory conditions , leading to autoimmune targeting .
we reported previously that cleaved forms of this protein generated during apoptosis and persisting through secondary necrosis have a disrupted c - terminus that retains the autoepitope [ reviewed in ref. ( 2 , 10 )] .
these aberrant forms of dfs70 / ledgfp75 enhance stress - induced cell death and may also exhibit increased immunogenicity in the context of tissue damage and inflammatory cell death .
the extracellular release of dfs70 / ledgfp75 , observed in lecs ( 13 ) , could also make this protein the target of a humoral immune response if this release occurs in a pro - inflammatory microenvironment .
depending on the context in which they arise , anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies could play various roles .
they may serve a protective role by removing dfs70 / ledgfp75 and its cleavage fragments from cellular debris generated during non - inflammatory apoptotic cell death .
they could also play a pathogenic role by binding to extracellularly released dfs70 / ledgfp75 and preventing it from entering cells where it could activate a stress survival pathway .
however , it would be fascinating to determine if autoantibody - mediated removal of dfs70 / ledgfp75 from extracellular circulation in the context of cancer or hiv infection could confer a protective advantage to patients due to the blockade of its pro - tumorigenic or hiv - in binding functions , respectively , by the antibodies .
these autoantibodies might also act as " sensors " or " reporters " of underlying , non - sard inflammatory conditions associated with increased oxidative stress and aberrant expression or functions of dfs70 / ledgfp75 that alter its immunogenicity ( 10 ) .
their presence in susceptible , " apparently healthy " individuals could be indicative of an undetected chronic inflammatory response .
it is plausible that these antibodies could be triggered by unidentified environmental factors .
the recent observation that hpv activates dfs70 / ledgfp75 ( 9 ) raises the intriguing possibility that hpv vaccination or infection may be associated with overexpression of this autoantigen in a pro - inflammatory context .
this could not only influence its cellular functions but also its immunogenicity .
conclusion a better understanding of the context in which anti - dfs70 / ledgfp75 autoantibodies arise will require not only increased knowledge on dfs70 / ledgfp75 biology but also comprehensive information on individuals that test positive for these autoantibodies .
this should include age , gender , health history , vaccination record , lifestyle , ethnicity , geographic location , and exposure to environmental stressors or xenobiotics .
this might help determine if the presence of these autoantibodies could be linked to specific environmental factors that may influence the levels of oxidative stress in a particular tissue microenvironment , leading to tissue damage , altered dfs70 / ledgfp75 expression or function , and enhanced immunogenicity of this protein under pro - inflammatory conditions .
conflict of interest statement the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .

background spatio - temporal control of extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) activity , a critical determinant of the cell 's response to growth factors , requires timely dephosphorylation of its regulatory tyrosine and / or threonine residue by mapk phosphatases .
we studied the physiological role of kinase interaction motif ( kim ) - containing protein tyrosine phosphatases ( ptps ) in the control of egf - and ngf - induced erk activity in neuroendocrine pc12 cells .
results we found a single kim - containing ptp to be endogenously expressed in rat pc12 cells : the transmembrane ptprr isoform termed pcptp1 .
protein knock - down of pcptp1 , or fourfold overexpression of its mouse orthologue , ptpbr7 , left egf - and ngf - induced erk1 / 2 activity in pc12 cells unaltered .
ectopic expression of cytosolic ptprr isoforms , however , resulted in reduced egf - induced erk1 / 2 activity , an effect that was dependent on the phosphatase activity and the kim - domain of these ptps .
conclusion the finding that robust changes in tyrosine - specific mapk phosphatase expression levels have minor effects on temporal erk1 / 2 activity control in pc12 cells suggests that dual - specificity mapk phosphatases may act as major regulators of growth factor - induced erk1 / 2 signaling in these cells .
background one of the best - studied cellular signaling relays is the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling cascade , the central mechanism by which growth factors steer cellular key decisions such as proliferation and differentiation [ 1 ] .
it has become clear that it is not just the amplitude but also the spatio - temporal distribution of the mapk activity within the cell that determines the final outcome of this signaling relay .
for example , in the rat pc12 phaeochromocytoma cell line seminal studies have shown that epidermal growth factor ( egf ) - induced proliferation relies on a transient activation of the extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( erk1 / 2 ) in the cytosol , whereas nerve growth factor ( ngf ) - induced differentiation requires a sustained erk1 / 2 activation and translocation to the nucleus [ 2,3 ] .
thus , not only signaling molecules that activate these ubiquitous mapks but also the ones that inactivate and / or localize them are important for determining signaling specificity .
erk activation requires the phosphorylation of two closely spaced regulatory tyrosine and threonine residues by the dual specificity map kinase kinases mek1 / 2 [ 4 ] .
concomitantly , erk inactivation involves dephosphorylation of these residues by mapk phosphatases .
although the egf and ngf specific pathways that lead to erk activation have been mapped in detail in pc12 cells [ 3 ] , the contribution of mapk phosphatases in this model system has received little attention .
the dephosphorylation of erk1 / 2 regulatory tyrosine and threonine residues can be achieved by three different phosphatase types : protein serine / threonine phosphatases , dual specificity ( serine / threonine / tyrosine ) phosphatases ( mkps / dusps ) and classical phosphotyrosine - specific protein tyrosine phosphatases ( ptps ) [ 5 ] .
the latter two types have gained considerable interest because they contain a so - called kinase interaction motif ( kim ) that is also present in the upstream mapk kinases mek1 / 2 .
the kim - domain mediates the interaction and in part determines binding specificity towards the different mapks [ 6 - 8 ] .
importantly , this interaction can be regulated via camp because pka - mediated phosphorylation of a serine residue within the kim - domain abolishes binding and dephosphorylation of mapks [ 9,10 ] .
mammals contain three classical ptp families that may regulate erk activity by kim - dependent binding and dephosphorylation : heptp / lc - ptp , step and ptprr ( fig. 1a ) .
the haematopoietic heptp / lc - ptp was indeed shown , through gene targeting studies , to be a physiological regulator of erk in lymphocytes [ 11 ] and the striatal - enriched phosphatase ( step ) enzyme family was found to regulate erk activity in primary neuronal cultures [ 12 ] .
for ptprr isoforms current data mainly reflect overexpression studies in non - neuronal cells [ 6,9,13 ] .
given that rat ptprr receptor - type isoform ( pcptp1 ) mrna levels in pc12 cells are increased nine - fold within 8 h following ngf treatment [ 14 ] , a role in neuronal differentiation induced by sustained erk activity may be expected .

mouse isoform nomenclature is given on the right .
signal peptides ( sp ) , proline - rich and pest domains ( pp ) , transmembrane segments ( tm ) , kinase - interacting motifs ( kim ) , hydrophobic regions ( hr ) and catalytic phosphotyrosine phosphatase domains ( ptp ) are indicated .
b ) assessment of kim - containing , tyrosine - specific ptp expression by rt - pcr .
rat protein nomenclature is indicated on the left , aligned with the diagrams of the mouse orthologs depicted in panel a ) .
step and heptp transcripts , as detected by rt - pcr (+) in mouse cerebrum ( crb ) and spleen ( spl ) rna , respectively , are not found in pc12 cells .
for rat ptprr proteins ( pcptp1 , pcptp1 - ce , ptppbsgamma ) isoform - specific primer sets were used on rat cerebellum ( cbl ) and pc12 total rna .
samples lacking rt enzyme ( - ) and appropriate plasmids ( p ) served as negative and positive controls , respectively .
a beta - actin specific rt - pcr served as a positive control for the reverse transcriptase reactions .
in the current study we assessed the contribution of the kim - domain - containing classical ptps to the regulation of erk activity in rat pc12 cells .
heptp and step mrnas were not detectable in pc12 cells .
for the ptprr gene a single transcript type , encoding the transmembrane isoform pcptp1 , was encountered .
we exploited retroviral transduction to increase or decrease ptprr protein levels and monitored growth factor - induced erk activation using phosphospecific antibodies .
our results demonstrate that kim - domain - containing tyrosine - specific ptps are dispensable for proper erk - dependent signaling in pc12 cells and put forward the dual - specificity mapk phosphatases as the physiological regulators of erk activity in these cells .
results a single classical kim - containing ptp is expressed in pc12 cells to determine which of the three kim - containing phosphotyrosine - specific ptps are endogenously expressed in rat pc12 cells , an rt - pcr analysis on total rna was performed .
expected amplicons for step and heptp were obtained from mouse cerebrum and mouse spleen rna , respectively , but step and heptp messengers remained undetectable in pc12 material ( fig. 1b ) , in concordance with earlier reports [ 15,16 ] .
for the rat ptprr gene two different transcripts , encoding pcptp1 and pcptp1 - ce , respectively , have been reported [ 17,18 ] .
pcptp1 mrna is present in pc12 cells [ 14,17,19 ] but pcptp1 - ce transcripts remain undetectable in pc12 rna , although the amplification product is readily obtained using rat cerebellum rna ( fig. 1b ) .
in mouse the ptprr - encoding gene generates a third transcript isoform which encodes two additional protein isoforms ( ptppbsgamma - 42 and ptppbsgamma - 37 ) through the use of alternative translation start sites [ 20 ] .
to be able to probe for the presence of putative rat ptppbsgamma variants , we searched in public databases for the rat ptprr genomic region displaying very high homology to mouse ptppbsgamma transcript - specific sequences and designed primers for use in rt - pcr assays .
indeed , the predicted ptppbsgamma - type fragment was amplified from rat cerebellum rna , while mouse ptppbsgamma cdna served as positive control , but no signal was obtained using pc12 material ( fig. 1b ) .
thus , in rat pc12 cells only the largest ptprr transcript , that encodes the receptor - type isoform pcptp1 , is expressed .
we next investigated ptprr isoform expression in pc12 cells at the protein level .
both western blot analysis of pc12 cell lysates and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed multiple immunoreactive bands ( e.g. fig. 2a and data not shown ) that compare well to patterns obtained with expression constructs for rat pcptp1 [ 17 ] .
proteins of around 72 and 65 kda in size are detected that represent endogenous rat pcptp1 and a post - translationally modified variant , respectively , as is the case for the mouse ortholog ptpbr7 [ 20 ] .
these data are in line with ptprr isoform pcptp1 to be the only detectable kim - containing phosphotyrosine - specific phosphatase in pc12 cells .
figure 2 erk activity profile is not affected by pcptp1 depletion .
a ) rnai - mediated knockdown of endogenous pcptp1 in pc12 cells .
pc12 cells stably expressing sirna targeted to nucleotides 2380 - 2398 in pcptp1 cdna ( psr - 2380 ) were generated via retroviral transduction .
empty vector ( psr ) was used as control and pcptp1 knockdown was rescued by transduction of psr - 2380 - containing cells with a retroviral expression construct for the mouse ortholog ptpbr7 .
equal amounts of protein from the resulting stable cell pools were subjected to immunoprecipitation using alpha - sl antiserum and captured proteins were analyzed on western blots using monoclonal antibody 6a6 .
b ) transient and sustained erk1 / 2 signaling in wild type pc12 cells .
after overnight serum deprivation , cells were stimulated with 100 ng / ml egf ( upper panels ) or 50 ng / ml ngf ( lower panels ) for the indicated time points .
cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis and phospho - erk1 / 2 signals ( perk1 , perk2 ) were detected using a chemiluminescence imaging system .
the same blot was reprobed with total erk1 antibody to correct for loading differences .
c ) transient erk activity is not affected in pcptp1 knockdown cells .
serum - starved cells were stimulated with 10 ng / ml egf for 2 or 5 min , respectively , and harvested .
relative phospho - erk1 / 2 levels in the protein lysates , determined as above , are presented as mean values +/ - sem from three independent experiments .
d ) pcptp1 knockdown in pc12 cells does not significantly alter erk activity at reduced levels of egf .
serum starved cells were stimulated with 0.075 ng / ml egf for the indicated time points and relative phospho - erk1 / 2 levels were determined as before .
results are mean values +/ - sem ( n = 4 ) .
rnai - mediated knock - down of pcptp1 to assess whether dephosphorylation by pcptp1 is of relevance for the regulation of egf - and ngf - induced erk signaling in pc12 cells , we aimed at silencing pcptp1 expression via rna interference .
different sirna sequences were tested through viral transduction with psuper - retro [ 21 ] and the one targeted to nucleotides 2380 - 2398 of pcptp1 resulted in an almost complete ablation of pcptp1 protein levels ( fig. 2a ) .
to enable exclusion of off - target effects in these cells , knockdown was also rescued by introduction of a retroviral expression vector encoding ptpbr7 , the mouse ortholog of pcptp1 .
effects on erk activity following egf or ngf administration to serum - starved pc12 cells were monitored over time by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates using phosphospecific erk1 / 2 antibodies .
reprobing the same immunoblot with antiserum directed against total erk1 enabled us to correct for loading differences between samples and to express erk1 / 2 activity as relative phosphorylation units .
egf administration to mock - transduced pc12 cells resulted in a very rapid but transient erk1 / 2 activation that peaks within the first 5 min ( fig. 2b , upper panels ) .
upon ngf treatment , erk1 / 2 biphosphorylation is maximal after some 10 min and then gradually decreases , with sustained erk1 / 2 activity still being detectable after 48 h ( fig. 2b , lower panels ) [ 22 ] .
reasoning that possible effects of the altered pcptp1 levels would be most noticeable at time points with maximal erk1 / 2 activation , we compared relative phospho - erk1 / 2 levels in the transduced cells at 2 and 5 min after egf addition ( fig. 2c ) or at 10 , 20 , 30 and 60 min following ngf administration ( data not shown ) .
depletion of pcptp1 , however , did not result in significant alteration of the response to egf or ngf administration .
also the use of very low egf concentrations , to ensure that erk1 / 2 is not maximally phosphorylated and pcptp1 knockdown may allow further increase of erk1 / 2 activity , did not reveal a significant difference in erk1 / 2 activation between mock transduced and pcptp1 knockdown cells ( fig. 2d ) .
effects of ptprr overexpression on transient and sustained erk activity as an alternative way to assess the relevance of ptprr activity for the regulation of erk signaling , we generated pools of pc12 cells that stably expressed mouse ptprr isoforms by means of retroviral transduction .
lysates of the resulting cell lines were first analyzed on western blots to determine ptprr expression levels ( fig. 3a ) .
transduction with mouse ptpbr7 - encoding viruses resulted in immunoreactive bands that superimposed on those of endogenous pcptp1 , confirming the previous annotation of these signals .
ectopic expression of mouse ptppbsgamma transcripts resulted in two additional immunoreactive bands which represent ptppbsgamma - 42 and ptppbsgamma - 37 [ 20 ] .
cells transduced with a construct encoding ptp - sl , the mouse ortholog of pcptp1 - ce , failed to display appreciable levels of expression ( not shown ) and are therefore not included in this study .
quantitation revealed that ptpbr7 expression exceeds three - fold the endogenous pcptp1 level , whereas ptppbsgamma expressing cells show ptprr levels that are some seventeen - fold higher than in non - transduced controls ( fig. 3b ) .
analysis of the subcellular distribution revealed that endogenous pcptp1 displayed a weak vesicle - type of staining in pc12 cells , and only limited cell membrane localization ( fig 3c , left panel ) .
in line with previous data [ 20,23,24 ] , its mouse ortholog ptpbr7 was detected at the cell membrane , on vesicular structures and at the golgi apparatus ( fig. 3c , middle panel ) .
mouse ptppbsgamma isoforms are cytosolic proteins that are excluded from the nucleus , while endogenous pcptp1 adds a speckled pattern ( fig. 3c , right panel ) .

a ) pc12 cells were retrovirally transduced with expression constructs for mouse ptprr isoforms , or mock - transduced .
equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to 10 % sds - page and immunoblotting .

results are the mean values +/ - sem of four individual pools of cells .
c ) subcellular localization of stably expressed ptprr protein isoforms in the transduced pc12 cells as determined by fluorescence microscopy using polyclonal alpha - sl antibody .
bar indicates 10 mum .
effects of ptpbr7 and ptppbsgamma expression on erk1 / 2 activity profiles in the transduced cells were again determined through phospho - erk1 / 2 immunoblots ( fig. 4a ) .
mean values for six independent experiments were plotted ( fig. 4b,c ) and identical results were obtained using independently derived pc12 stably transduced cell pools .
ectopic expression of ptpbr7 was found to have no effect on egf - induced transient and ngf - induced sustained erk1 / 2 activity .
at 5 min following egf addition the ptpbr7 expressing cells display a small reduction in erk1 / 2 activity , but this does not reach significance .
likewise , at 2 min following egf administration and at 10 , 20 , 30 or 60 min after ngf treatment the phospho - erk1 / 2 levels in the various cell pools expressing ptppbsgamma are indifferent from those in mock - transduced cells .
on the contrary , ptppbsgamma expressing cells show a significant reduction in erk1 / 2 activity levels 5 min after egf administration ( p < 0.008 ; fig. 4b ) .
separate analyses of the erk1 and erk2 activity levels provided essentially the same results ( data not shown ) .
thus , boosting ptprr activity in the cytosol 17 - fold results in a significant ~ 25 % reduction of erk1 / 2 activity during the later phase of the transient response to egf .

a ) pc12 cells stably expressing ptppbsgamma show reduced transient erk1 / 2 activity .

results are presented as mean values +/ - sem from six independent experiments ( student 's t - test , * p < 0.008 ) .
c ) increased ptprr levels have no effect on ngf - induced erk1 / 2 activity .
serum starved pc12 cell pools stably expressing ptpbr7 or ptppbsgamma were stimulated with 50 ng / ml ngf for the indicated time points ( in min ) .
cells were then lysed and phospho - erk1 / 2 were analysed on western blots as in panels a - b. results are the mean +/ - sem of three independent experiments .
ptprr effects on erk activity involve kim - mediated interactions the binding of kim - domain - containing phosphatases to their mapk targets can be abrogated by the camp - dependent protein kinase pka , through phosphorylation of a specific serine residue within the kim - domain [ 9,10,12 ] .
intriguingly , current models on transient versus sustained erk activation in pc12 cells incorporate an ngf - induced pka - mediated signaling pathway [ 22 ] .
to investigate whether this mechanism kept ptprr isoforms from regulating erk phosphorylation levels in pc12 cells , we investigated the phosphorylation status of the kim domain serine residue in immunoprecipitated ptprr proteins using an antibody directed against phosphorylated pka substrates .
administration of the pka activator forskolin was used to determine maximum levels of kim - domain phosphorylation [ 12 ] .
phosphorylation levels of endogenous pcptp1 in pc12 cells were , unfortunately , below detection level ( data not shown ) .
in ptppbsgamma - expressing pc12 cells about half of this phosphatase appeared phosphorylated following overnight serum starvation , and egf or ngf administration even led to a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of the regulatory serine ( fig. 5a,b ) .
in ptpbr7 expressing cells , however , the ptpbr7 kim - domain seems maximally phosphorylated under all conditions tested ( fig. 5c , d ) , which may explain the negative findings regarding erk1 / 2 activity modulation by this receptor - type ptprr isoform .
figure 5 assessment of ptprr kim domain phosphorylation .
a ) lysates of ptppbsgamma expressing cells after overnight serum starvation ( t = 0 ) and subsequent treatment with egf , ngf or forskolin were subjected to immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody 6a6 , and captured proteins were analyzed on blot using a phospho - pka substrate antibody ( upper panel ) and 6a6 ( lower panel ) .
it was ascertained that the phospho - pka substrate antibody remained unreactive towards ptppbsgamma mutant s94a ( data not shown ) .

d ) quantitative representation of phospho - ptpbr7 levels as determined in c. results are presented as mean values +/ - sem ( n = 3 ) .
to determine whether the phosphatase activity and / or mapk binding potential of ptppbsgamma is required for the observed attenuation of the egf - stimulated transient erk activity ( fig. 4 ) , pc12 cell pools were generated that stably express specific ptppbsgamma mutants .
ptppbsgamma c343s and d309a mutants represent catalytically impaired versions that still may bind phosphotyrosine - containing substrates [ 25 ] .
in the deltakim mutant the kim - domain has been deleted , making it unable to associate with mapks [ 6 ] .
furthermore , because phosphorylation is known to regulate its association with mapks [ 9,13 ] , we also included the ptppbsgamma s94a / t116a double mutant in this series of experiments .
the ptppbsgamma mutant - expressing cell pools demonstrated expression levels that were comparable with or even exceeding that of wild - type ptppbsgamma expressing cells ( fig. 6a ) .
again , relative phospho - erk1 / 2 levels were determined by phospho - immunoblot analyses .
only in pc12 cells expressing wild type ptppbsgamma or pka - insensitive ptppbsgamma s94a / t116a a significant decrease in erk1 / 2 activity at 5 min , but not at 2 min , following egf stimulation is apparent ( fig. 6b ; p < 0.05 ) .
the catalytically impaired mutants as well as the version without the kim - domain have lost this ability , demonstrating the requirement of a direct association with and subsequent dephosphorylation of the mapk by the ptp .
figure 6 wild type and non - phosphorylatable ptppbsgamma affect erk activity .
a ) expression analysis of wild type and mutant ptppbsgamma proteins .
equal amounts of protein from pc12 cells stably expressing wild type ( wt ) or mutant ( deltakim , d309a , s94a / t114a , and c343s ) ptppbsgamma were subjected to sds - page and immunoblot analysis using antibody 6a6 .
b ) egf - induced erk1 / 2 activity in pc12 cells stably expressing ptppbsgamma protein variants .
serum starved cells that stably express ptppbsgamma mutants were stimulated with 10 ng / ml egf for 2 or 5 min , and lysed .
relative phospho - erk1 / 2 levels were determined via immunoblot analysis as described in the legends to fig. 2. results are presented as mean values +/ - sem ( n = 4 , student 's t - test ; * p < 0.05 ) .
discussion the neuroendocrine pc12 cell line represents a paradigm model system to study spatial and temporal aspects of growth factor - induced mapk signaling [ 2,26 ] .
in this study we made an inventory of the mapk - associating , phosphotyrosine - specific ptps that are endogenously expressed in this cell system and tested their physiological relevance for the spatio - temporal control of egf - and ngf - induced erk1 / 2 activity .
the ptprr isoform pcptp1 was the only detectable kim - domain containing classic ptp in these cells .
knockdown of pcptp1 protein levels or additional expression of its mouse ortholog ptpbr7 , however , left transient and sustained erk1 / 2 signaling in response to egf or ngf , respectively , unaltered .
our finding that in this cell system ptpbr7 was constitutively phosphorylated on a regulatory serine residue within the kim - domain , precluding its binding to erk , provides a likely explanation .
ectopic expression of the cytosolic ptppbsgamma isoforms resulted in a decrease of egf - induced , but not ngf - induced , erk1 / 2 activation .
this effect required ptppbsgamma enzymatic activity and an intact kim - domain , pointing to a direct association with and dephosphorylation of the mapk .
in line with this , only some 30 - 50 % of the ptppbsgamma molecules was found to be phosphorylated on their kim serine residue , leaving the majority available for engagement in erk binding and dephosphorylation .
it is unclear what causes the differential effect by the ptppbsgamma isoforms as compared to the receptor - type ptpbr7 protein on the amplitude of the transient erk activity following egf administration .
it may well be attributable to the distinct subcellular localizations of these ptprr isoforms or rather could reflect the much higher expression levels for ptppbsgamma - 42 / ptppbsgamma - 37 as compared to ptpbr7 .
why ptppbsgamma ectopic expression affects only the transient and not the sustained erk activity profile , however , must have other grounds .
current models incorporate an ngf - induced pka - mediated signaling pathway in pc12 cells [ 22 ] and , reasoning along these lines , ptppbsgamma proteins may thus become hyperphosphorylated in the kim - domain upon ngf addition .
in contrast , we found that treatment with egf and ngf both resulted in significantly lower ptppbsgamma phosphorylation levels .
this may be explained by assuming that the initial boost of erk1 / 2 activity following growth factor addition results in a rapid kim region - mediated association of ptppbsgamma and erk1 / 2 , thereby protecting the regulatory serine in the kim region from subsequent phosphorylation .
irrespective , the pka - mediated signaling that results from ngf treatment of pc12 cells , and that is required for the sustained nature of the erk activity as compared to the transient egf effects [ 22 ] , does not explain the ptppbsgamma selective effect .
in line with our findings , ectopic overexpression of a cytosolic version of ptp - sl ( thus resembling ptppbsgamma isoforms ) in pc12 cells has been reported previously to result in reduced phospho - erk5 and phospho - erk1 / 2 levels following egf administration [ 27 ] .
those data , however , were not quantified nor tested for statistical significance .
in contrast with our studies , ogata and coworkers did observe a suppressive effect of ptpbr7 on sustained erk activity in pc12 cells [ 19 ] .
those experiments , however , involved transient transfections that likely result in much higher ptpbr7 expression levels , and activation of the pc12 cells was done through co - transfection of constitutively active mek1 instead of ngf administration .
furthermore , not erk phosphorylation status but transcriptional activity of its downstream substrate elk1 was used as a read - out , and together this may have caused an exaggeration of effects .
pcptp1 , the rat homologue of mouse ptpbr7 , is abundantly expressed in several rat brain regions , including the cerebellum , cerebral cortex and the hippocampus [ 17 ] .
intriguingly , pcptp1 mrna levels are increased 9 - fold over the initial 8 h of ngf - induced differentiation of pc12 cells [ 14 ] , in line with a role in neuronal differentiation induced by sustained erk activity .
our protein knockdown experiment , however , are at odds with a critical role for pcptp1 in erk1 / 2 - dependent processes in pc12 cells .
other kim - domain - containing tyrosine - specific ptps cannot camouflage the impact of pcptp1 signaling since we excluded expression of other ptprr isoforms , step and heptp / lc - ptp in pc12 cells .
on the other hand , redundancy with kim - domain - containing dual - specificity phosphatases ( mkp / dusp ) may well explain ptprr 's modest effect on erk1 / 2 signaling .
in drosophila , for example , redundancy regarding erk inactivation was encountered for dmkp3 , a homolog of mammalian mkp - 3 / mkp - 4 , and ptp - er , the drosophila homolog of ptprr [ 28 ] .
potential candidates that could take over the role of the ptprr proteins in pc12 cells are mkp - 3 , mkp - 4 , mkp - x and dusp2 , in view of their localization in the cytoplasm and high specificity towards erk1 / 2 [ 5 ] .
we detected mkp - 3 and mkp - x transcripts in pc12 cells by rt - pcr analyses ( data not shown ) but did not observe alterations in growth factor - induced erk1 / 2 activity profiles following rna interference strategies towards depletion of mkp - 3 and mkp - x ( data not shown ) .
it should be noted that verification of changes in mkp protein levels was not performed due to lack of suitable antibodies .
what other substrate targets for pcptp1 may exist in pc12 cells to explain its endogenous presence ?
besides erk1 / 2 , ptprr proteins were shown to bind the mapk family members p38alpha and erk5 [ 6,9,13,27,29 ] but these studies were mostly performed in non - neuronal cells , using either recombinant proteins or ectopically expressed phosphatases and mapks .
further studies towards the identification of the physiological targets of ptprr isoforms are therefore needed .
in addition , current in vitro studies might be hampered by the fact that potential ligands for the pcptp1 / ptpbr7 extracellular part , which may critically control the activity of the phosphatase , have not been identified yet .
also in view of the restricted expression pattern of the ptprr gene [ 17,24,30 ] and its conserved potency to generate multiple protein isoforms through the use of different promoters , alternative splicing and multiple start codons [ 18,20,30 ] it may well be that the tyrosine phosphatase ptprr family members will prove physiological regulators of mapk signaling in other cell systems and following different stimuli than the ones tested here .
given the lack of endogenous ptprr expression in many neuronal cell lines , studies in ptprr deficient mice are eagerly awaited to address their functional significance in mapk signaling in vivo .
conclusion the ptprr isoform pcptp1 is the sole tyrosine - specific ptp in pc12 cells that is able to bind erk mapks through its kim - domain and it is readily up - regulated upon growth factor - induced differentiation of these cells .
still , the physiological regulation of erk1 / 2 signaling in pc12 cells could not be ascribed to this ptp .
we conclude that other , dual - specificity mapk phosphatases may act as major regulators of egf - and ngf - induced signaling pathways in these cells .

the bamhisite in plxsn - ires2 - egfp was subsequently used to insert the bglii insert from psg5 - ptppbsgamma - fl [ 20 ] , rendering plxsn - ptppbsgamma - ires2 - egfp. by inserting the n - terminus - encoding ecori fragment from ptpbr7 - egfp [ 23 ] into ecori - digested plxsn - ptppbsgamma - ires2 - egfp we generated plxsn - ptpbr7 - ires2 - egfp .
mutant plxsn - ptppbsgamma constructs were generated as follows .
first mutant ptp - sl open reading frames were excised from prk5 - ptp - sl expression vectors ([ 6 ] kindly provided by dr. r. pulido , valencia , spain ) using noti and xhoi , and ligated in between the corresponding sites in plxsn .
using bstbi we subsequently excised the mutation - containing sequence parts from the obtained plasmids and inserted them into bstbi - digested plxsn - ptppbsgamma - ires2 - egfp .
for sirna constructs , appropriate oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated in the psuper - retro vector psr [ 21 ] .
plasmids psr - 1211 and psr - 2380 encode sirnas that target the nucleotides 1211 - 1229 and 2380 - 2398 in the pcptp1 mrna [ genbank : d38292 ] , respectively .
all constructs were verified by sequence analysis .
cell culture and retroviral transduction pc12 cells ( atcc # crl - 1721 ) were grown on collagen - coated dishes in dmem supplemented with 10 % fcs and 5 % horse serum ( hs ) at 37degreesc .
ecotropic phoenix packaging cells [ 32 ] were cultured in dmem , 10 % fcs .
for retrovirus production , phoenix cells were transiently transfected by calciumphosphate precipitation .
twenty - four hours after transfection , medium was replaced by dmem containing 10 % fcs and 5 % hs. after 10 h retrovirus - containing medium was collected , filtered through a 0.45 - mum pore - size filter and supplemented with polybrene ( sigma - aldrich chemie b.v. , zwijndrecht , the netherlands ) to a final concentration of 5 mug / ml .
pc12 cells were infected by replacing culture medium with undiluted polybrene - and retrovirus - containing medium for 8 - 16 h. after four subsequent rounds of infection , transduced cells were selected for 2 - 3 weeks in medium containing 500 mug / ml g418 ( gibco europe , breda , the netherlands ) or 2.5 mug / ml puromycin ( sigma - aldrich chemie b.v. ) , respectively .
immunoblot analysis cells were seeded in six - well plates at a density of 1 * 106 cells / well .
the next day medium was replaced by dmem without serum .
after o / n serum deprivation , cells were treated with 0.075 - 100 ng / ml egf ( a kind gift of dr. j. van zoelen , nijmegen , the netherlands ) or 50 ng / ml ngf ( n6009 , sigma - aldrich chemie b.v. ) for different time periods .
cells were washed twice with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) before being scraped with a rubber policeman in 75mul lysis buffer : 50 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.5 ; 150 mm nacl ; 1 % triton x - 100 ; 100 mm naf ; 2 mm na3vo4 ; 20 mm na4p2o7 ; 1 mm pmsf ; protease inhibitor cocktail ( roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim , germany ) .
lysis was continued on ice for 30 min and insoluble components were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation for 25 min at 14.000 rpm and 4degreesc .
supernatants were stored at - 20degreesc until further use .
protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically [ 33 ] .
protein samples ( 8 mug ) were subjected to sds - page on 10 % pa gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride ( pvdf ) membranes .
blots were blocked for 30 min using 3 % non - fat dry milk in tbs - t ( 10 mm tris - hcl , ph 8.0 ; 150 mm nacl ; 0.05 % tween - 20 ) and incubated overnight at 4degreesc with a 1:2000 dilution of a phospho - erk1 / 2 monoclonal antibody (# 9106 , cell signaling technology , beverly , usa ) .
following three washes with tbs - t , blots were incubated for 1 h with a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - mouse igg ( pierce biotechnology inc. , rockford , il , usa ) in 3 % non - fat dry milk in tbs - t. immunoreactive bands were detected with lumi - lightplus western blotting substrate ( roche diagnostics gmbh ) using a biochemi imaging system and obtained signals were quantified with the labworks 4.0 program ( uvp bioimaging systems , cambridge , uk ) .
blots were then stripped for 40 min at 60degreesc ( in 62.5 mm tris - hcl , ph 6.6 ; 100 mm beta - mercapto - ethanol ; 2 % sds ) , washed with tbs - t and reprobed for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal erk1 ( c - 16 ) antibody ( sc - 93 , santa cruz biotechnology , inc. , santa cruz , usa ) at a dilution of 1:8000 in tbs - t containing 3 % non - fat dry milk .
peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit igg ( pierce biotechnology inc. ) was used for detection and quantitation as described above .
ratios of the phospho - erk1 / 2 / total erk1 signals were determined for every sample and , to be able to compare signal ratios originating from different blots , a reference standard sample ( corresponding to a pc12 cell lysate following 5 min treatment with egf ) was included on each blot .
ptprr expression levels were determined by subjecting 50 mug of total protein to sds - page and immunoblot analysis as described above , using monoclonal antibody 6a6 [ 20 ] .
phospho - ptppbsgamma and phospho - ptpbr7 levels were determined by western blotting of 6a6 immunoprecipitates , performed as described previously [ 20 ] , from ptppbsgamma or ptpbr7 expressing cells which had been incubated with 10 ng / ml egf , 50 ng / ml ngf or 10 mum forskolin after overnight serum starvation .
blots were incubated simultaneously with a rabbit monoclonal phospho - pka substrate ( rrxs */ t *)( 100g7 ) antibody (# 9624 , cell signaling technology ) and with 6a6 , both in a 1:1000 dilution .
goat anti - mouse and goat anti - rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to alexa fluor 680 ( molecular probes ) or irdye800 ( rockland immunochemicals ) fluorescent dyes were used for detection and quantification on an odyssey infrared imaging system ( li - cor ) .
immunofluorescence microscopy cells , cultured on collagen - coated coverslips , were fixed at room temperature for 30 min in phem buffer ( 60 mm pipes ; 25 mm hepes , ph 6.9 ; 10 mm egta ; 2 mm mgcl2 ) containing 4 % paraformaldehyde , and subsequently washed with pbs and permeabilized for 5 min using 0.2 % triton x - 100 in pbs .
aspecific sites were blocked by incubating for 30 min with 4 % bsa in pbs before cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal alpha - sl antiserum [ 24 ] in pbs containing 0.4 % bsa .
following three washes with pbs , cells were incubated for 1 h in a 1:300 dilution of alexa568 - conjugated goat - anti - rabbit igg ( molecular probes ) in pbs , 0.4 % bsa .
following pbs washes and methanol dehydration , coverslips were mounted on glass slides using mowiol ( sigma - aldrich ) , and images were collected using confocal laser scanning microscopy ( mrc1024 , bio - rad ) .

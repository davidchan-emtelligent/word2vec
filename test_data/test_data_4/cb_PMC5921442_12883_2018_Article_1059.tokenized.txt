rp eventually leads to the deformation of these structures [ 1 ] .
this disease has a wide array of clinical manifestations that can mimic other unrelated diseases , and it has no specific laboratory indicators .
an involvement of the central nervous system ( cns ) is rare in rp and is often not considered by physicians , which may result in delayed treatment .
here , we report the case of a patient with pleocytosis who was initially considered to have tuberculous meningitis ( tbm ) .
however , further exploration finally led to a diagnosis of rp with meningoencephalitis .
case presentation a 64 - year - old man with a history of headache for 4 months , dull responses , and gait disturbance for 3 months was admitted to our hospital .
at admission , the patient had low - grade fever and replied very slowly ( sometimes incorrectly ) to questions .
however , he was able to follow simple orders .
the patient had symmetrical paralysis of both lower limbs , leaving him unable to walk without assistance .
in addition , auricular swelling ( fig. 1 ) was observed upon physical examination .
bilateral kernig 's sign was positive and ankle clonus was present .
assessment with the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) yielded a score of 20 / 30 , indicating impaired cognitive function .
it was noteworthy that the patient had difficulty performing simple mathematical tasks as he had been an accountant for decades. fig. 1 bilateral swelling of the auricles in our patient .
swelling of left ( a ) and right ( b ) side of the auricles in our patient we reviewed the patient 's history and found that he had been in good health before the onset of symptoms .
in particular , the patient had no history of trauma , smoking , alcohol abuse , allergy , recent vaccination , or hereditary factors .
headache and intermittent fever occurred after travelling , which led him to seek medical advice 4 months prior to his admission .
at that time , tbm was suspected based on cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) tests , which revealed pleocytosis with a predominance of lymphocytes ( table 1 ) .
however , after a few weeks of antituberculous therapy , the patient developed several new symptoms , including ear swelling , tinnitus , dizziness , and gait disturbance .

two months after his first admission , the patient was diagnosed as having rp based on the damiani and levine criteria [ 2 ] , and was treated with low - dose steroids .
antituberculous therapy was continued simultaneously .
however , he showed little symptomatic improvement with treatment .
at the time of admission to our hospital , the patient 's csf was assayed again .
we detected pleocytosis ( table 1 ) and increased immunoglobulin g ( igg ) levels ( 125 mg / l ) .
csf pathogen cultures and serologic tests for bacteria , viruses ( such as human immunodeficiency virus , herpes simplex virus , epstein - barr virus , varicella - zoster virus , hepatitis viruses , and enteroviruses ) , fungi , parasites , and treponema yielded negative results .
the results of assays for tumor markers and paraneoplastic - related antibodies were also negative .
in addition , assays for cns vasculitis and autoimmune encephalitis yielded negative results. between the patient 's first clinical visit and admission to our hospital , his erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) increased from 40 mm / h to 111 mm / h. an anti - nuclear antibody ( ana ) test indicated a particle pattern with a titer of 1:100 .
the level of anti - cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody ( anti - ccp ) was 10 u / ml. the results of tests for other immune and rheumatoid biomarkers , such as anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody , lupus anticoagulant , anti - phospholipid antibodies , and rheumatoid factors , were all negative or within the normal range .
a gene x - pert mycobacterium tuberculosis / rifampin detection test eliminated the possibility of a rifampin - resistant gene locus .
other indices were negative or within the normal ranges .
spinal magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) findings were normal .
however , brain mri indicated brain atrophy , hydrocephalus , and abnormal signals in periventricular white matter .
brain mri with gadolinium enhancement showed leptomeningeal enhancement mainly in the right occipitotemporal and posterior cingulate gyri ( fig. 2 ) , but not in the basal cisternal area , which is often indicative of typical tubercular meningitis. fig. 2 head mri of the patient .
a , b t1 - and t2 - weighted images indicate supratentorial ventricular enlargement and abnormal signals in periventricular white matter , respectively .
c , d head mri with gadolinium enhancement indicated leptomeningeal enhancement mainly located in the right temporal lobe ( black arrow ) and posterior cingulate gyri ( white arrow ) based on the aforementioned examinations , we suspected that the patient had rp with meningoencephalitis .
subsequently , intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy ( 500 mg for 3 days ) with methotrexate ( mtx , 12.5 mg , once per week ) was administered .
supportive and symptomatic treatments were also provided .
three weeks after treatment initiation , the patient 's symptoms dramatically improved .
we also observed a decrease in the esr ( 20 mm / h ) , normalization of csf assay results ( table 1 ) , and an improved mmse score of 28 / 30 .
upon discharge , the patient had normal responses and was able to walk for 1000 m without help .
no flare - up was reported at the 6 - month follow - up visit .
discussion and conclusion initially , the patient was suspected to have tbm , which has a relatively high incidence rate in china .
the detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis is necessary for a diagnosis of tbm .
however , in reality , csf cultures for mycobacterium tuberculosis have a low positive rate in patients with tbm [ 3 ] .
therefore , empirical treatment for tbm is usually initiated in patients clinically suspected of having the disease .
unfortunately , following several months' treatment with standard antituberculous therapy , the patient 's condition did not improve but rather deteriorated , although we did not detect mutations in rifampin - resistant genes .
in addition , a transient normalization of the lymphocyte count in the csf during therapy and an atypical enhancement pattern on brain mri aroused suspicions of a potential diagnosis of tbm .
moreover , the patient constantly complained of side effects of antituberculous therapy throughout the treatment course .
therefore , we cautiously stopped antituberculous treatment after a general discussion .
we considered a diagnosis of aseptic meningitis because repeated csf gram stains and cultures were negative .
aseptic meningitis is a clinical syndrome characterized by meningeal inflammation not caused by pyogenic bacteria [ 4 ] , but by some other factors such as infectious agents ( e.g. , viruses and parasites ) , neoplasms , anatomical structure - related events , vaccinations , drug - induced diseases , and autoimmune or inflammatory diseases .
however , our patient likely did not have infectious aseptic meningitis because repeated csf pathogen cultures and serologic tests were all negative .
negative results in tumor - related assays also indicated that the patient 's condition was unlikely to be due to the presence of neoplasms .
furthermore , there was no history of trauma or recent vaccination for the patient .
drug - induced aseptic meningitis was deemed unlikely in our patient , especially as he denied the use of any drugs before symptom onset .
after ruling out the above possibilities , the cause underlying the patient 's condition remained unknown .
the signs and symptoms in our patient indicated the presence of both meningitis and encephalitis .
to the best of our knowledge , prior to admission , the patient had only been diagnosed with rp , a rare autoimmune disease .
we observed rheumatoid and immune - related abnormalities in our patient , such as elevated esr , ana , anti - ccp , and csf igg levels .
notably , csf pleocytosis has previously been reported in patients with rp and , although rare , neurological involvement may be observed in rp [ 5 ] .
therefore , we suspected a correlation between rp and meningoencephalitis .
significant clinical improvement in our patient after treatment with a high - dose corticosteroid confirmed a diagnosis of rp with meningoencephalitis .
the etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of rp remain largely unknown .
the diagnostic criteria for rp are mainly clinical and no specific laboratory parameters have been confirmed to date .
rp with meningitis or meningoencephalitis is rare , with approximately 3 % of patients with rp having complications involving neurological symptoms [ 5 ] .
pleocytosis was detected in our patient .
vasculitis of the intracranial arteries , autoantibodies against the glutamate receptor glurepsilon2 , and the presence of neutral glycosphingolipids in the csf may explain cns involvement in some cases of rp [ 6 - 8 ] .
although the pathogenesis of pleocytosis in rp is unclear , it seems to be associated with autoimmunity .
we observed a recurrent pattern of pleocytosis in 6 lumbar punctures from our patient .
karyocyte levels were normalized in the fourth csf assay , which was conducted between adjacent assays with abnormalities before steroid treatment .
to our knowledge , spontaneous normalization of karyocyte levels in csf has not been previously reported in any other type of meningitis or meningoencephalitis .
this may indicate a unique pattern of symptoms in this disease .
therefore , this is the first specific description of pleocytosis recurrence in a patient with rp. the marked normalization of karyocyte levels in csf shortly after treatment may consequently invalidate previous diagnosis of tbm .
there are currently no randomized clinical trials of treatments for rp with meningitis or meningoencephalitis .
normally , empirical treatments are performed and steroid pulse therapy is preferred in most cases [ 7 ] .
however , therapy may be ineffective or flare - ups may occur when an improper dosage is used or upon premature termination of therapy , as observed in our patient .
the administration of immunosuppressive agents , such as azathioprine , mtx , cyclophosphamide , or cyclosporin a , may reduce the need for the long - term use of steroids and contribute to symptom control [ 9 ] .
meningoencephalitis is a rare complication of rp. here , we report a case of rp with meningoencephalitis that was initially misdiagnosed as tbm .
the patient recovered after steroid pulse therapy .
this is also the first report of recurrent pleocytosis in a patient with rp accompanied by meningoencephalitis .
early diagnosis and steroid therapy are important in rp patients with meningoencephalitis .
more case reviews and research are required to uncover the pathogenesis of rp and its rare neurological involvement .
consent informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images .

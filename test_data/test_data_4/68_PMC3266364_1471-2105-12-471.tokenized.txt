background dna methylation is regarded as a potential biomarker in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer .
the relations between aberrant gene methylation and cancer development have been identified by a number of recent scientific studies .
in a previous work , we used co - occurrences to mine those associations and compiled the meinfotext 1.0 database .
to reduce the amount of manual curation and improve the accuracy of relation extraction , we have now developed meinfotext 2.0 , which uses a machine learning - based approach to extract gene methylation - cancer relations .
description two maximum entropy models are trained to predict if aberrant gene methylation is related to any type of cancer mentioned in the literature .
after evaluation based on 10 - fold cross - validation , the average precision / recall rates of the two models are 94.7 / 90.1 and 91.8 / 90 % respectively .
meinfotext 2.0 provides the gene methylation profiles of different types of human cancer .
the extracted relations with maximum probability , evidence sentences , and specific gene information are also retrievable .
the database is available at http :// bws.iis.sinica.edu.tw : 8081 / meinfotext2 / .
conclusion the previous version , meinfotext , was developed by using association rules , whereas meinfotext 2.0 is based on a new framework that combines machine learning , dictionary lookup and pattern matching for epigenetics information extraction .
the results of experiments show that meinfotext 2.0 outperforms existing tools in many respects .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study that uses a hybrid approach to extract gene methylation - cancer relations .
it is also the first attempt to develop a gene methylation and cancer relation corpus .
background epigenetics involves the study of mitotically heritable changes in gene expression that are mediated by dna and histone modifications without altering the dna sequence [ 1 ] .
dna methylation , one of the most critical epigenetic events in mammals , is primarily found on the carbon 5 position of the cytosine ring in the context of cpg dinucleotides [ 2 ] .
during the methylation reaction , dna methyltransferases ( dnmts ) catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from s - adenosyl - l - methionine ( sam ) .
a number of studies have found that abnormal gene methylation , including hypermethylation and hypomethylation , are associated with the development and progression of cancer ; however , the precise mechanisms are still unclear [ 3,4 ] .
hence , if the methylation profile is unique to a certain type of cancer , dna methylation could be an important diagnostic and prognostic biomarker [ 5 ] .
information extraction ( ie ) , a field of text mining , selects specific facts about pre - defined types of entities and relationships of interest [ 6 ] .
as the publication rates in epigenetics have grown exponentially in recent years , several studies have tried to extract information about gene methylation - cancer associations from large collections of textual data .
for example , meinfotext 1.0 uses term co - occurrences in abstracts and sentences together with association rules to identify such relationships [ 7 ] .
the pubmeth database also uses co - occurrences and the data is reviewed manually to identify cancer - gene methylation associations [ 8 ] .
the major drawback with co - occurrence methods is that the results may contain a large number of false positive relations due to the lack of syntactic and semantic analysis .
moreover , manual curation may lead to low recall results .
as mentioned above , dna methylation plays an important role in abnormal gene expression and cancer development .
however , little research has been done on automatically extraction dna methylation information with the use of machine learning or other natural language processing techniques [ 9 ] .
the field of biomedical research is highly versatile [ 10 ] .
domain - specific text mining methods must be developed to help researchers and physicians in coping with information overload [ 11 ] .
in this paper , we present meinfotext 2.0 , which uses a hybrid approach to extract gene methylation - cancer relations .
the updated database provides more accurate and large - scale gene methylation profiles as well as the distributions of different types of cancer without the need for a great deal of manual curation .
this work would aid epigenetics researchers in making more efficient use of the existing knowledge for practical application .
construction and content meinfotext 2.0 is a relational database implemented by mysql 5.0 and php programming language .
to compile the database , we collected 11,770 abstracts from pubmed by using " human ," " methylation " and " cancer " as keywords. from the abstracts , we generated 40,365 sentences containing methylation - related terms .
human gene information , including entrez gene id , official gene symbol , aliases , full name and summary was obtained from ncbi entrez gene to construct a gene dictionary .
based on the dictionary , we employed our gene normalization technology [ 12 ] to normalize the recognized gene mentions .
figure 1 shows the system architecture of meinfotext 2.0 and the steps of the information extraction process .
figure 1 the system architecture of meinfotext 2.0 .
dna methylation - related abstracts were collected from pubmed and processed by sentence splitting and expansion .
then , our methylation and gene mention tagger annotated the collected abstracts with methylation terms and gene names , after which the relations between two entities were extracted by two trained maximum entropy ( me ) models .
the first model determined the gene - methylation ( g - m ) relation .
all positive sentences were annotated with the type of cancer by using a pattern - based cancer type tagger .
the second me model extracted gene - cancer relations .
the gene information , methylation statistics and associations ranked in descending order of probability are stored in meinfotext 2.0 .
users can query the database via the web interface using gene names or cancer types , or a combination of both .
named entity recognition ( ner ) gene symbols / names were identified by nerbio , an ml - based bio - ner system with an f - score of 85.76 % [ 12 - 14 ] .
we utilized the pattern "( hyper | hypo )?( - )?( methylat. +)" to identify methylation named entities , where '.'
indicates a character and '+' indicates that the character immediately to the left of the symbol may appear more than once .
to develop the cancer named entity recognizer , we combined a cancer dictionary and regular expression patterns .
the dictionary containing cancer names was compiled from meinfotext 1.0 and the abbreviations for different types of cancer were collected from two public websites , http :// www.cancerindex.org / medterm / medtm15.htm and http :// www.changbioscience.com / abbr / a0a.htm .
the patterns used to identify cancer types are as follows : ( 1 ) abbreviation ; ( 2 ) ( tumor site ) ( cancer - related keyword ) ; ( 3 ) (.+ oma | leukemia | leukaemia ) .
abbreviation includes the acronyms for cancer types such as npc ( nasopharyngeal carcinoma ) and crc ( colorectal cancer ) .
cancer - related keyword is a specialized lexicon comprised of the following surface names : cancer , tumor ( tumour ) , neoplasm , carcinogenesis , tumorigenesis and metastasis. with the exception of pattern ( 1 ) , the matching strategies are case - insensitive gene methylation - cancer relation extraction we formulate the task of extracting gene methylation - cancer relations as a binary classification problem .
the first model determines if each gene - methylation ( g - m ) pair in the annotated sentences is positive .
then , the derived positive sentences are input to the second model to identify positive gene - cancer ( g - c ) pairs .
dataset since there are no publicly available annotated corpora for training a gene methylation - cancer association extraction system , we collected epigenetics - related abstracts from meinfotext 1.0 to compile g - m and g - c corpora .
then we manually annotated each g - m pair and g - c pair in the sentences .
if a sentence contained more than one g - m or g - c pair , the sentence was duplicated several times according to the number of possible combinations of the terms in all the pairs so that each sentence only contained one pair .
for example , the sentence , s1 , "[ socs1 ] gene , [ socs2 ] gene , [ rassf1a ] gene , [ cdkn2a ] gene , and [ mgmt ] gene were [ methylated ] methylation in 75 , 43 , 64 , 75 , and 64 % of [ melanoma ] cancer samples , respectively " , contains 5 g - m pairs .
therefore , it would be duplicated and rewritten as 5 sentences , each containing exactly one g - m pair for g - m model training .
for the g - m corpus , if a gene entity in a sentence is described as methylated , then the relation is regarded as positive ; otherwise , it is regarded as negative .
in the above sentence , there are five positive instances .
for the g - c corpus , if the methylated gene described in a sentence is involved in the development of cancer or the gene 's methylation status is detectable in cancers , then the relation is labeled as positive ; otherwise , it is labeled as negative .
in the above example , five positive g - c pairs were generated .
both corpora contained 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative sentences .
inter - annotator agreement we randomly selected a subset of 400 sentences from our corpus .
gene , methylation and cancer named entities ( ne ) and g - m relations and g - c relations were manually annotated by two annotators with biomedical background .
the inter - annotator agreement is 95 % determined as the intersection of annotated ne and relations divided by the total number of ne and relations .
model generation we use the maximum entropy ( me ) [ 15 ] learning model as the ml tool .
figure 2 shows the employed feature set and extracted feature values for the g - m pair , mgmt and methylated , in sentence s1 .
our feature set includes the word n - grams between entities , surrounding words , chunks , parse tree paths , the relative position of the sentence containing the entities in an abstract , and the template features , which were also used in our previous work for hypertension gene extraction [ 16 ] .
to generate template features for g - m and g - c , we used smith and waterman 's local alignment algorithm [ 17,18 ] to calculate the similarity of all paired sentences with true associations .
the scoring scheme of an award of + 1 for match and a penalty of - 1 for both mismatch and gap was adopted .
then , we manually reviewed the paired sentences with the top 100 scores to create templates , such as " < gene > promoter < methylation > " and " < gene > is frequently methylated in < cancer > " .
we used zhang 's maxent toolkit [ 19 ] to train two me models , denoted as gm and gc , for g - m and g - c relation extraction respectively .
figure 2 the employed feature set and extracted feature values for a g - m pair : word n - gram features include all word unigrams and bigrams located between g and m ; surrounding word features include the two words before the first named entity and the two words after the second named entity ; chunk features include inter - gm chunk heads , surrounding chunk heads and inter - gm chunk types ; the parse tree path feature is the syntactic path through the parse tree from the first named entity to the second named entity ; and sentence position means the relative position of a sentence in an abstract .
utility query method figure 3 shows the meinfotext 2.0 web interface , which can be accessed by inputting a gene name or type of cancer , or a combination of the two .
searching by genes yields general gene information , cross - references , gene methylation statistics and cancers related to the gene methylation ranked by the following equation : figure 3 the web interface of meinfotext 2.0 .
figure 3 ( a ) the search interface with three search options : ( 1 ) by inputting gene names , ( 2 ) by selecting cancer types , and ( 3 ) by combining specific genes and types of cancer .
after checking the query terms , the system returns the gene methylation profile across human cancer types and highlights the evidence sentences , as shown in figures 3 ( c ) and 3 ( d ) .
( 1 ) rankingscore = sumi = 1np ( genexmethylation,cancery ) ithsentence for each g - c pair , there may be more than one evidence sentence with the relation probability calculated by the gc maximum entropy model .
the sum of total probabilities for each gene and cancer relatedness is used to represent the ranking score of the g - c pair .
querying by cancer type returns genes methylated in the cancers ranked in the same way .
users can also find genes methylated in pre - specified cancer types by searching genes and cancers together .
the relations extracted from the current literature are also available .
in this study , the profiles of gene methylation across human tumor types provide the frequency patterns of gene methylation based on the number of evidence sentences and the maximum probability , as shown in figure 3 ( c ) .
for example , to access information about the brca1 ( breast cancer 1 , early onset ) , gstp1 ( glutathione s - transferase pi ) and esr1 ( estrogen receptor 1 ) gene methylation profile across various types of cancer , a user could input brca1 , gstp1 , esr1 as search terms separated by line breaks .
gene orthographic variants , such as brca1 and brca - 1 , are generated based on a few simple rules [ 20 ] .
next , the system checks if the searched genes are available in the database .
after selecting gene symbols , the returned web page displays a table containing information about gene - cancer pairs , the average maximum probability , the number of evidence sentences and their frequency .
the average maximum probability is the sum of the ranking scores divided by the number of sentences .
the cancer set shown in the left - hand column lists the cancers associated with any one of the three genes .
the user can then examine the extracted sentences ranked by their maximum probability scores .
keywords are highlighted and links to pubmed are also provided .
in addition to the gene methylation profile , if only a single gene is queried , the gene summary , cross - references to other public databases , and statistics about hypermethylation and hypomethylation are shown .
users can select one type of cancer , such as breast cancer , ( or several types ) to find a set of genes undergoing abnormal methylation related to the cancer ( s ) of interest .
it is also possible to input multiple official gene symbols separated by line breaks and select multiple cancer types to retrieve the profiles of gene methylation across human cancer types .
for instance , let us consider the following set of genes discussed by esteller et al .
[ 21 ] : cdkn2a , cdkn2b , mgmt ( o6 - methylguanine - dna methyltransferase ) , mlh1 , brca1 , gstp1 , dapk1 , cdh1 ( cadherin 1 ) , timp3 ( timp metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 ) , tp73 , and apc ( adenomatous polyposis coli ) .
if the genes are input to the system and different types of cancer , such as colorectal , lung , breast , brain , gastric , liver , esophageal , bladder , blood , kidney , ovarian , head and neck , pancreatic , endometrial and lymphatic cancer , are selected , the methylation profile of each gene related to the different cancers will be shown .
the profile may also reflect the specific involvement of the gene in the selected type of cancer or groups of cancers .
discussion the pages retrieved by meinfotext 2.0 for the above gene methylation profile are similar to the results reported by esteller et al .
[ 21 ] .
for example , cdkn2a is hypermethylated across colorectal , lung and breast cancer with an average maximum probability of 0.8 and a total of 306 evidence sentences .
meanwhile , hypermethylation of brca1 is found primarily in breast and ovarian cancer with an average maximum probability of 0.84 and approximately 41 evidence sentences .
in the next section , we consider the ner performance as well as the g - m and g - c relation extraction performance .
the predictive performance measures for the trained models are defined as follows : precision = tptp + fp and recall = tptp + fn , where tp , fp and fn denote the number of true positives , false positives and false negatives respectively .
ner and relation extraction performance the data used to evaluate the cancer named entity recognizer was downloaded from http :// biotext.berkeley.edu / data / dis _ treat _ data / sentences _ with _ roles _ and _ relations [ 22 ] .
the disease named entities tagged < dis ></ dis > or < disonly ></ disonly > and the cancer names , except general terms like tumor , were used for evaluation .
if an exact matching strategy is employed , the precision and recall rates for cancer name recognition are 85.2 % and 79.5 % respectively ; while under the approximate matching strategy [ 23 ] , the rates are 99.1 % and 81.8 % respectively .
to evaluate g - m and g - c relation extraction , we applied 10 - fold cross validation on the g - m and g - c corpora .
we randomly selected 900 sentences from the corpora to train the gm and gc models and used the remainder for testing .
the average precision / recall rates were 94.7 +/ - 2.1 / 90.1 +/ - 2.8 and 91.8 +/ - 3.2 / 90.0 +/ - 1.6 % for the gm and gc models respectively .
both models were trained with all the features shown in figure 2 .
there was no obvious performance improvement (< 0.01 ) when the template features were used .
system evaluation and utility we conducted three experiments to evaluate the proposed relation extraction scheme .
the first experiment was designed to determine if meinfotext 2.0 outperformed version 1.0 in terms of extracting gene methylation - cancer relations .
we retrieved 403 gene methylation and cancer associations from meinfotext 1.0 based on the following 20 genes : pycard , cdh13 , cox2 , dapk1 , esr1 , gata4 , syk , mlh1 , tp73 , prdm2 , pgr , sfrp1 , socs1 , socs3 , stk11 , tmeff2 , thbs1 , rassf5 , prkcdbp and rarb .
the above genes are known to be methylation - related and were used in our previous study .
table 1 shows that our me models significantly improve the precision of relation extraction at the expense of a small reduction in recall .
in the table , co - occurrences in abstracts and co - occurrences in sentences refer to the association mining methods used in meinfotext 1.0 .
table 1 gene methylation and cancer relation extraction precision / recall rates precision (%) recall (%) co - occurrences in abstracts 62.8 98.8 co - occurrences in sentences 84.6 100 gm + gc 95.4 90.9 gm 92.4 94.8 the second experiment compared our system 's performance with that of pubmeth on an evaluation dataset used by pubmeth in a review article on dna methylation in breast cancer .
the article lists 39 genes known to be hypermethylated in breast cancer .
the meinfotext 2.0 database contains 38 of those genes , and 23 are described in breast cancer .
in addition , querying meinfotext 2.0 for breast cancer information returns more than 150 genes , 87 of which have at least two references and 63 have one reference with a probability greater than 0.8 .
the review also lists 8 genes reported to be hypomethylated in breast cancer ; 7 of them are available in our database and 4 are described in breast cancer .
however , pubmeth can not provide hypomethylation information .
table 2 compares the number of genes available , the genes methylated in breast cancer , and the genes searched for breast cancer in the two databases .
table 2 comparison of the information available in meinfotext 2.0 and pubmeth meinfotext 2.0 pubmeth # hypermethylated genes available 38 ( 97 %) 27 ( 69 %) # hypermethylated genes described in breast cancer 23 ( 59 %) 20 ( 51.3 %) # hypomethylated genes available 7 ( 87.5 %) 0 # hypomethylated genes described in breast cancer 4 ( 50 %) 0 # genes searched for association with breast cancer > 150 94 we also compared the search results in terms of the number references and evidence sentences .
searching brca1 in pubmeth returned 7 related types of cancer , namely , breast , ovarian , lung , gastric , cervical , pancreatic , and brain cancer .
the number of references / evidence sentences for the 7 types of cancer in pubmeth and meinfotext 2.0 were , respectively , 12 / 7 vs. 14 / 27 , 19 / 12 vs. 6 / 14 , 1 / 0 vs. 2 / 3 , 1 / 1 vs. 1 / 1 , 1 / 1 vs. 1 / 1 , 2 / 1 vs. 0 / 0 , and 1 / 1 vs. 1 / 1 .
furthermore , we performed a cancer - centric search to find the top 10 breast cancer and gene pairs listed on the pubmeth results page .
in table 3 , we compare the association evidence sentences extracted by pubmeth and meinfotext 2.0 .
the results demonstrate that meinfotext 2.0 provides more accurate association information , as well as more references and evidence sentences because of automatic text mining .
in addition , the low average reference intersection between pubmeth and meinfotext 2.0 suggests that the two systems may be complementary .
table 3 comparison of the cancer - gene methylation association evidence sentences extracted by pubmeth and meinfotext 2.0 pubmeth # references pubmeth # evidence sentences meinfotext2.0 # references meinfotext2.0 # evidence sentences reference intersection (%) ( breast , brca1 ) 11 7 14 27 2 ( 18.2 %) ( breast , rassf1 ) 10 9 20 27 6 ( 60 %) ( breast , cdkn2a ) 10 7 25 45 3 ( 30 %) ( breast , apc ) 11 10 10 17 3 ( 27.3 %) ( breast , cdh1 ) 10 8 12 14 2 ( 20 %) ( breast , gstp1 ) 4 3 7 12 0 ( 0 %) ( breast , esr2 ) 5 4 3 7 1 ( 20 %) ( breast , ccnd2 ) 7 5 8 11 3 ( 42.9 %) ( breast , esr1 ) 5 5 15 22 1 ( 20 %) ( breast , sfrp1 ) 2 5 6 11 2 ( 100 %) the third experiment was designed to further evaluate the performance of meinfotext 2.0 using data published by kim et al , 2010 [ 24 ] , which reports 58 genes methylated in colorectal cancer ( crc ) .
all 58 genes are available in our database , and 72.4 % are reported to be associated with gene methylation and crc .
the average maximum probability is 0.87 and there are 10 evidence sentences .
the second and third experiments indicate that meinfotext 2.0 performs well in epigenetics studies that focus on different types of cancer .
veeck and esteller [ 4 ] identified hypermethylation as an important mechanism in mirna silencing ; and they listed 3 mirnas silenced by , or involved in , epigenetic mechanisms. of the 3 genes , it has been reported that mir - 9 - 1 with unknown target genes is hypermethylated in human breast cancer [ 25 ] , an association also found by meinfotext 2.0 .
information about tumorgenesis and mirna gene methylation , such as mir - 34a [ 26 ] and mir - 181c [ 27 ] , is also available in the database .
moreover , the extracted information shows that aberrant expression of dnmt1 ( dna methyltransferase 1 ) breast cancer is associated with the loss of dna methylation [ 28 ] .
to determine if dnmt1 or other dna methyltransferases may be the potential target genes of mir - 9 - 1 , we used microrna.org [ 29 ] for prediction .
our database does not contain any mir - 9 - 1 information , but it can retrieve the prediction results for mir - 9 .
although dnmt1 is not predicted as the target gene of mir - 9 , microrna.org shows that mecp2 ( methyl cpg binding protein 2 ) may contain two hsa - mir - 9 target sites .
a previous study [ 30 ] posited that the silence of the er promoter in the breast cancer cell line is associated with dna hypermethylation , histone modification and the recruitment of mecp2 , dnmt1 and other proteins .
the hypothesis suggests that mir - 9 - 1 hypermethylation abnormally increases the expression of mecp2 , which in turn represses the transcription of methylated dna via the recruitment of a histone deacetylase activity associated with dnmt1 [ 31 ] .
further investigation is needed to elucidate the relationships between mir - 9 - 1 , mecp2 and dnmt1 in breast carcinogenesis .
conclusion meinfotext 2.0 provides more accurate information about gene methylation - cancer associations discussed in a large number of studies .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study that uses machine learning , a domain dictionary and pattern matching to extract genetic - epigenetic relations .
such relations are important for determining if unique profiles exist for specific types of cancer , and assessing how to improve cancer detection and treatment by using dna methylation biomarkers .
the study is also the first attempt to create a gene methylation - cancer corpus .

there are no studies investigating the relationship between endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( enos ) gene polymorphisms and hepatorenal syndrome ( hrs ). aim .
the purpose of this study is to elucidate whether enos gene polymorphisms ( g894t and t - 786c ) play a role in the development of type - 2 hrs. methods .
this study was carried out in a group of 92 patients with cirrhosis ( 44 patients with type - 2 hrs and 48 without hrs ) and 50 healthy controls .
polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and melting curve analysis. results .
we did not find any significant difference in allele and genotype distributions of the enos - t - 786c polymorphism among the groups ( p = 0.440 ) .
however , the frequency of gt ( 40.9 %) and tt ( 13.6 %) genotypes and mutant allele t ( 34.1 %) for the enos g894t polymorphism were significantly higher ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , resp. ) in the hrs group than in both the stable cirrhosis ( 14.6 % , 4.2 % , and 11.5 % , resp. ) and the control ( 22.0 % , 2.0 % , and 13.0 % , resp. ) groups. conclusion .
the occurrence of mutant genotypes ( gt / tt ) and mutant allele t in enos - g894t polymorphisms should be considered as a potential risk factor in cirrhotic patients with hrs .
1. introduction hepatorenal syndrome ( hrs ) , one of the most severe complications of cirrhosis , is defined as functional renal failure in the course of an acute liver injury and / or chronic liver disease .
two types of hrs in cirrhosis were initially defined by the international ascites club based on major and minor criteria .
type - 1 hrs is a form of rapidly progressing renal failure defined by a doubling of the baseline serum creatinine to a level greater than 2.5 mg / dl in less than two weeks .
type - 2 hrs is characterized by a steady or slow increase in serum creatinine levels to over 1.5 mg / dl. type - 2 hrs is frequently associated with refractory ascites , whereas type - 1 hrs is usually triggered by infection .
cases of untreated type - 1 hrs have a remarkably low survival rate in comparison to untreated cases of type - 2 hrs [ 1 , 2 ] .
the pathogenetic pathway underlying the development of hrs is not completely understood .
hrs develops as a result of abnormal hemodynamics , leading to splanchnic and systemic vasodilatation along with renal vasoconstriction [ 3 ] .
nitric oxide ( no ) is a potent vasodilator that plays an important role in this abnormal hemodynamics .
some studies have suggested that no is elevated in the peripheral circulation of patients with cirrhosis [ 4 , 5 ] .
no is produced from l - arginine by three nitric oxide synthase ( nos ) isoenzymes : neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nnos ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) , and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( enos ) .
the human enos gene is located on chromosome 7 and contains 26 exons .
there are many functional polymorphisms in different regions of the enos gene [ 6 ] .
a functional polymorphism in exon 7 of human enos corresponds to a glu - asp change at codon 298 ( glu298asp , g894t ) ( rs1799983 ) .
enos g894t allele carriers tend to exhibit diminished enos enzyme activity in comparison to gg homozygotes [ 7 ] .
second functional polymorphism is a point mutation of thymine to cytosine at nucleotide - 786 ( t - 786c ) ( rs2070744 ) in the 5 ' - flanking region of the enos gene , which can result in a significant decrease in promoter activity [ 8 ] and significantly reduce serum no levels [ 9 ] .
although many studies have investigated no levels in cirrhotic patients , the present study aimed to elucidate whether two enos polymorphisms ( g894t and t - 786c ) play a role in the development of hrs .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
study design this was a prospective study , which was conducted at inpatient and outpatient hepatology clinics of the inonu university medical faculty .
the study was approved by the ethical committee of the institution involved , in compliance with the declaration of helsinki .
all participants signed an informed consent document before enrolling in the study .
2.2 .
participants a total of 92 patients with cirrhosis ( 44 patients with type - 2 hrs and 48 patients without hrs ) and 50 controls were included in the study .
participants were classified into three study groups as follows .
group - 1 : type - 2 hepatorenal syndrome ( hrs ) .
the 44 patients recruited in this group had been diagnosed with type - 2 hrs according to the criteria of the international ascites club [ 1 ] .
these patients also had a clinical and / or histopathological diagnosis of cirrhosis .
serum creatinine levels in this group were > 1.5 mg / dl. the exclusion criteria were shock , fluid losses , concurrent treatment with nephrotoxic drugs , proteinuria of greater than 500 mg / day as measured by 24 - hour urine collection , more than 50 urine red blood cells per high - power field , and patients who did not fulfill hrs diagnostic criteria .
patients with ascitic fluid infection and other active infections , patients that have been receiving nitrates , and patients with bleeding esophageal varices were not included .
abdominal and renal ultrasounds were performed to exclude a postrenal cause for renal dysfunction and to check for the presence of ascites .
for patients with hrs , diuretics were interrupted for at least 48 hours .
albumin and / or saline were infused to prevent prerenal acute kidney injury as a result of volume depletion .
group - 2 : stable cirrhosis .
this group included 48 patients with clinical and / or histopathological diagnosis of cirrhosis secondary to various causes , including alcohol consumption , viral hepatitis , autoimmune hepatitis , or unknown etiology .
these patients had serum creatinine values < 1.5 mg / dl. cases in this group were enrolled from patients who presented to clinics for routine procedures and check - ups .
these patients had no renal dysfunction , active infection , or malignancy .
group - 3 : control .
fifty adult volunteers were recruited from the hepatology outpatient clinic to serve as controls .
they had no liver or renal disease , acute infection , inflammatory disease , or malignancy .
2.3 .
demographic data and collection of blood samples demographic characteristics were also recorded via face - to - face patient interviews .
peripheral blood samples were collected from all participants to perform blood counts , routine biochemistry , prothrombin time ( pt ) , and enos gene polymorphism molecular analysis .
participants also provided freshly voided first morning urine for urinalysis .
model for end - stage liver disease ( meld ) and modification of diet in renal disease ( mdrd ) scores were calculated for all patients included in the study .
glomerular filtration rates ( gfr ) were calculated using the mdrd equation .
2.4 .
enos gene polymorphism molecular analysis 2.4.1 .
isolation of genomic dna genomic dna was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using high pure pcr template preparation kits ( roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim , germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
kits were stored at - 20degreesc until analysis .
2.4.2 .
genotype analysis determination of polymorphisms ( g894t [ glu298asp ] [ e298d ] [ rs1799983 ] and - 786 t > c [ rs20707440 ]) was performed using lightcycler real time pcr ( roche diagnostics , mannheim , germany ) and a lightsnip assay from tib molbiol ( berlin , germany ) .
a 20 mul mixed reaction solution - - which contained 10.4 mul of water , 2 mul of lc ( tm ) faststart dna master hybprobe kit ( roche diagnostics ) , 1.0 mul of lightsnip reagent mix , 1.6 mul mgcl2 ( 25 mm ) , and 5 mul of genomic dna - - was transferred into capillary tubes .
pcr conditions were as follows : 10 minutes for initial denaturation at 95degreesc , 45 cycles at 95degreesc for 10 seconds for further denaturation , 10 seconds at 60degreesc for annealing , and 15 seconds at 72degreesc for extension .
the melting point analysis uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer to detect polymorphic sites .
melting curve analysis was performed with an initial denaturation at 9degreesc for 20 seconds , 20 seconds of denaturation at 40degreesc , slow heating to 85degreesc with a ramping rate of 0.2degreesc / second , and continuous fluorescence detection .
polymorphic , mutated , and wild - type alleles were identified by the specific melting temperature ( t m ) of the resulting amplicons .
t m values for the g894t ( rs1799983 ) g and t alleles were 60.01degreesc and 65.98degreesc , respectively , and for the - 786 t > c ( rs2070744 ) c and t alleles were 59.09degreesc and 66.17degreesc , respectively .
the values for the respective melting temperatures varied by +/ - 2.5degreesc between different experiments .
genotype screening was performed simultaneously for cases and controls .
2.4.3 .
plasma nitrite assay plasma nitrite levels were measured as total nitrite with the spectrophotometric griess reaction .
this was done because it has been shown that plasma nitrite / nitrate is an index of endogenous no production [ 10 , 11 ] .
the procedure was partly adapted from the method described by ozbek et al .
[ 12 ] .
first , all plasma samples were deproteinized .
briefly , for every 200 microl plasma sample , 400 microl of 10 % zinc sulfate and 400 microl of 0.5 n sodium hydroxide were added .
the plasma samples were then vortexed and centrifuged at 25.000 xg for five minutes at 4degreesc .
for this study , 200 microl of deproteinized aliquot or water blank was incubated in a final volume of 750 microl containing 75 microl of 0.32 mol / l potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 7.5 ) , 25 microl of nitrate reductase ( sigma ) with nadph ( 50 micromol / l ) and fad ( 5 micromol / l ) as coenzymes , and 650 microl of water for two hours .
after reducing nitrate to nitrite with nitrate reductase , total nitrite was determined with griess reagent by mixing equal volumes of the reduced samples with griess reagent ( a 1 : 1 ratio of 0.1 % alpha - naphthylamine in water / 1 % p - aminobenzene sulfamide in 5 % phosphoric acid ) .
the samples were allowed to stand for 15 minutes and then read in a spectrophotometer at an absorbance of 548 nm. a range of sodium nitrite standards ( 0 - 100 micromol / l ) was prepared , and a standard curve was used to convert plasma sample measurements to micromoles per liter of nitrite .
the reaction was linear from 0.25 to 100 micromol / l. assays were performed as duplicates .
the interassay and intra - assay coefficients of variation for the assay were < 7 % and < 4 % , respectively .
2.5 .
statistical methods normally distributed data were summarized by mean and standard deviation .
comparison of the groups in terms of these variables was performed by one - way anova , and the tukey method was used for pairwise comparisons .
for nonnormally distributed data , median , minimum , and maximum values were used to express the data , and the kruskal - wallis test was applied for comparison of the groups .
after the kruskal - wallis test , the conover method was used for multiple comparisons .
categorical data are presented in terms of count and percentage .
chi - square tests were used to test genotypic association and allelic association and to test for the presence of the hardy - weinberg equilibrium .
multinomial logistic regression analyses were used for odds ratio estimations .
power analysis was done to provide reliable and realistic results of our study .
power values of statistical analysis for genotype frequencies were calculated as 95.4 % to 93.1 % allele frequency .
in all analyses , the significance level was considered to be 0.05 .
the statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ver .
21.0 for windows ; spss , chicago , il , usa ) was used for all analyses .
3. results a total of 92 patients with cirrhosis ( 44 patients with type - 2 hrs and 48 without hrs ) and 50 controls were included in this study .
the patients with hrs included 16 ( 36.4 %) women and 28 ( 63.6 %) men .
the patients with stable cirrhosis included 17 ( 35.4 %) women and 31 ( 64.6 %) men .
there were no differences between the control group and the other groups in terms of age or sex .
however , patients in the stable cirrhosis group were significantly younger than those in the hrs group ( p < 0.05 ) .
underlying etiologies for cirrhosis included hepatitis b in 44 ( 47.8 %) patients , hepatitis c in 16 ( 17.4 %) patients , autoimmune hepatitis in six ( 6.5 %) patients , alcoholic liver disease in 17 ( 18.5 %) patients , and cryptogenic cirrhosis in nine ( 9.8 %) patients .
patients with hrs had significantly higher average meld scores ( p < 0.001 ) compared with those in the stable cirrhosis group ( 27 versus 13 ) .
gfr ( 30.5 - 90.99 ) was lower in the hrs group than in the other groups .
ascites were found in all patients with hrs .
the clinical characteristics of the study groups are presented in table 1 .
3.1 .
endothelial nitric oxide synthase g894t polymorphism the frequency of gt ( 40.9 %) and tt ( 13.6 %) genotypes and mutant allele t ( 34.1 %) for the enos g894t polymorphism were significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) in the hrs group than in the stable cirrhosis group ( 14.6 % , 4.2 % , and 11.5 % , resp. ) .
the results of this distribution are presented in tables 2 and 3 .
we compared gg , gt , and tt genotype frequencies and assessed risk ratios according to genotype among the groups in various combinations .
the risk of development of hrs in hrs patients with the gt genotype was 5 times higher ( or = 5.014 , 95 % ci = 1.797 - 13.990 ) than in stable cirrhosis patients with the gg genotype .
however , the risk of development of hrs increased 3.1 - fold ( or = 3.109 , 95 % ci = 1.233 - 7.841 ) in hrs patients with the gt genotype in comparison to patients in the control group with the gg genotype .
the risk of development of hrs increased by 5.8 ( or = 5.850 , 95 % ci = 1.081 - 31.661 ) and 11.4 - fold ( or = 11.400 , 95 % ci = 1.282 - 101.368 ) in patients with the g894 tt genotype of hrs in comparison to the stable cirrhosis and control groups with the gg genotype , respectively ( table 2 ) .
there was no statistically significant difference in terms of genotype distribution between the cirrhosis group and controls ( table 2 ) .
allelic frequencies were compared in order to assess risk ratios based on type of allele among the groups .
there was a significant difference between the distribution of t alleles in the hrs group and that of the stable cirrhosis group , with the hrs group exhibiting a 3.4 - fold ( or = 3.462 , 95 % ci = 1.667 - 7.188 ) increased risk of hrs .
there was also a significant difference in the distribution of t alleles between the hrs group and the control group , with the hrs group exhibiting a 3.9 - fold ( or = 3.997 , 95 % ci = 1.856 - 8.609 ) increased risk of hrs .
there were no statistically significant differences in the association of genotype and allele frequencies of enos 894g / t gene polymorphisms between the stable cirrhosis and the control groups ( p > 0.05 ) ( tables 2 and 3 , resp. ) .
3.2 .
endothelial nitric oxide synthase - 786t / c polymorphism there were no significant differences in genotype and allele distributions of the enos 786t / c polymorphism among the hrs , stable cirrhosis , and control groups ( p > 0.05 ) ( tables 2 and 3 ) .
3.3 .
plasma nitrite levels nitrite levels in the hrs group were significantly higher than in the stable cirrhosis and control groups ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , resp. ) .
nitrite levels in patients with enos g894t homozygous tt genotype were significantly lower compared to those in patients with gg or gt genotypes in the hrs group ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , resp. ) .
the plasma nitrite levels are presented in table 4 .
4. discussion in this study , we determined that enos polymorphism for g894t is a risk factor in the development of hrs , despite finding no relationship between the enos polymorphism for t - 786c and hrs .
this experiment is the first study on the relationship between enos gene polymorphisms and hrs .
renal vasoconstriction triggered by splanchnic and systemic vasodilatation is the most important mechanism in the development of hrs .
no is a potent vasodilator that plays a key role in these abnormal hemodynamics .
l - arginine ( l - arg ) , a nonessential amino acid , is the precursor for no production by nitric oxide synthase ( nos ) [ 13 ] .
in patients with cirrhosis , hepatic clearance of amino acids , including l - arginine , is decreased , and this may partially explain increased no due to increased levels of substrate [ 14 , 15 ] .
no has a very short half - life ; therefore , measurements of the no metabolites , nitrite and nitrate , are commonly used to estimate plasma no levels .
the concentration of nitrite rather than nitrate is a better marker for detection of endogenous no concentration .
in this study , the concentrations of nitrite were assessed , not no concentration .
it has been shown that no levels are increased in cirrhotic patients , especially in the decompensated subgroup ; yet , a clear association between no levels and renal dysfunction has not been demonstrated [ 4 , 5 ] .
in a study conducted by kayali et al. , no levels were found to be increased in cirrhotic patients with renal dysfunction , and the highest levels were observed in patients with hrs .
one of the notable findings in this study was the fact that l - arginine levels were increased in these patients [ 16 ] .
there are few studies on the effect of no on renal hemodynamics .
although la villa et al. observed that renal plasma flow increased in patients with compensated cirrhosis whose no levels were inhibited by n ( g ) - monomethyl - l - arginine ( l - nmma ) , thiesson et al. detected a reduction in the renal plasma flow of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [ 17 , 18 ] .
however , another randomized placebo - control study found that renal plasma flow decreased as a consequence of inhibition of no , and no is an important renal vasodilator and natriuretic in patients with cirrhosis [ 19 ] .
in recent years , the number of studies investigating the relationship between enos gene polymorphisms and no has gradually increased .
in a study conducted with healthy men , no significant association was found between enos genotypes and no levels , whereas a significant increase was found in the frequency of alleles c ( promoter ) , 4b ( intron 4 ) , and glu ( exon 7 ) in the group with low no levels [ 20 ] .
however , in healthy african - american subjects , it was found that t - 786c and glu298asp polymorphisms did not affect production of no , although the frequency of the " c - 4b - glu " haplotype was significantly increased in patients with low no levels [ 21 ] .
tsukada et al. found that plasma no levels of subjects who are homozygous for the a allele were nearly 20 % lower than those in subjects with the b allele [ 22 ] .
another study emphasized that different enos gene polymorphism ( enos tag snp ) by alternating nitrite concentration could affect cardiovascular health of children and adolescents [ 23 ] .
studies investigating the relationship between enos gene polymorphisms and coronary heart disease are especially notable .
enos t - 786c polymorphism has been observed to be associated with decreased no production and coronary artery spasm [ 9 ] , and enos t - 786c mutation in white americans with prinzmetal 's variant angina pectoris ( pva ) has been identified as a reversible etiological factor .
it has been confirmed that administration of l - arginine , a no precursor , to these subjects improves pva symptoms [ 24 ] .
in a meta - analysis conducted by luo et al. , it was emphasized that enos g894t polymorphism was a leading factor in increased myocardial infarction ( mi ) risk in asians , and ethnicity was found to play a significant role in the development of mi [ 25 ] .
in the light of these studies , ethnicity has a significant impact on no concentrations and other different enos gene polymorphisms ( not only enos g894t and t - 786c ) [ 23 ] .
therefore , participants who were from different regions and various ethnic groups were not included .
on the basis of the above studies , it is observed that enos gene polymorphism results in low no production , which triggers vasoconstriction .
however , splenic vasodilation develops primarily , and renal vasoconstriction subsequently establishes in the pathogenesis of hrs with high no levels .
this study demonstrates that the enos g894t homozygote mutant ( tt ) and heterozygote ( gt ) genotypes are associated with significantly increased risk of developing hrs .
in the hrs group , particularly in subjects with the enos g894t homozygous tt genotype , the significantly low nitrite levels were remarkable .
these results confirm that enos polymorphism causes a decline in the production of no. in conclusion , this study found that enos gene polymorphism is a risk factor for hrs development .
large - scale prospective studies , including concurrent assessment of serum no levels , are needed to fully elucidate the effects of enos polymorphism ( especially g894t ) on susceptibility to hrs .

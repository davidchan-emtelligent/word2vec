background systemic immune activation ( inflammation ) and immunosenescence develop in some people with advancing age .
this process , known as " inflamm - aging ," is associated with physical frailty and sarcopenia .
meanwhile , successful antiretroviral therapy has led to a growing number of older hiv - 1 - infected individuals who face both age - related and hiv - 1 - related inflammation , which may synergistically promote physical decline , including frailty and sarcopenia .
the purpose of our study was to determine if inflammation during treated hiv - 1 infection worsens physical impairment in older individuals .
methods we determined the severity of hiv - associated inflammation and physical performance ( strength and endurance ) in 21 older hiv - infected individuals ( 54 - 69 years ) receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy , balanced for confounding variables including age , anthropometrics , and co - morbidities with 10 uninfected control individuals .
biomarkers for microbial translocation ( lipopolysaccharide [ lps ]) , inflammation ( soluble cd14 [ scd14 ] , osteopontin , c - reactive protein [ crp ] , interleukin - 6 [ il - 6 ] , soluble icam - 1 [ sicam - 1 ] and soluble vcam - 1 [ svcam - 1 ]) , and coagulopathy ( d - dimer ) were assayed in plasma .
activation phenotypes of cd4 + t cells , cd8 + t cells and monocytes were measured by flow cytometry .
physical performance was measured by 400 m walking speed , a short physical performance battery [ sppb ] , and lower extremity muscle strength and fatigue .
results overall physical function was similar in the uninfected and hiv - infected groups .
compared to uninfected individuals , the hiv - infected group had elevated levels of scd14 ( p < 0.001 ) , crp ( p < 0.001 ) and il - 6 ( p = 0.003 ) and an increased frequency of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells with an immunosenescent cd57 + phenotype ( p = 0.004 and p = 0.043 , respectively ) .
neither plasma inflammatory biomarkers nor cd57 + t cells correlated with cd4 + t cell counts .
furthermore , none of the elevated inflammatory biomarkers in the hiv - infected subjects were associated with any of the physical performance results .
conclusions when age - related co - morbidities were carefully balanced between the uninfected and hiv - infected groups , no evidence of inflammation - associated physical impairment was detected .
despite careful balancing for age , bmi , medications and co - morbidities , the hiv - infected group still displayed evidence of significant chronic inflammation , including elevated scd14 , crp , il - 6 and cd57 + t cells , although the magnitude of this inflammation was unrelated to physical impairment .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background antiretroviral treatment ( art ) has dramatically increased the life expectancy of hiv - infected individuals. by 2015 , more than one half of hiv - infected individuals are projected to be over 50 years old [ 1 ] .
this increased life expectancy has prompted questions about how aging with hiv - 1 infection combined with hiv treatments might interact to impact active life expectancy ( e.g. , having adequate mobility to function as a member of the community ) .
hiv - 1 infection causes systemic immune system activation fostered by a complex array of insults [ 2 , 3 ] .
the immune activation markers that are detected in hiv - 1 infection are typically also elevated with increased age in the absence of hiv infection [ 3 - 5 ] .
similar to aging , hiv infection is associated with the premature development of cardiovascular disease , thromboembolic disease , type 2 diabetes , cancer , neurocognitive decline , end - organ disease and frailty even when effective art is implemented [ 3 , 5 , 6 ] .
in hiv infection , chronic stimulation by lps and other substances emanating from a leaky intestinal barrier leads to the activation of innate immune cells , including monocytes and macrophages , which can be measured in sera based on the levels of the lps - binding protein soluble cd14 [ scd14 ] [ 7 - 9 ] , and scd14 levels remain elevated even with prolonged therapy [ 10 ] .
notably , scd14 has been implicated as a biomarker for the risk of non - aids mortality among hiv - infected subjects [ 11 ] .
additional markers of innate immune activation , including interleukin - 6 [ il - 6 ] and the acute phase molecule c - reactive protein [ crp ] , are also predictive of non - aids hiv mortality [ 12 , 13 ] .
elevation of the coagulation factor d - dimer is independently associated with cardiovascular disease [ 14 ] and mortality in hiv infection [ 12 ] .
the monocyte chemotactic protein osteopontin [ opn ] is persistently elevated in hiv - 1 infection [ 15 ] and is further increased in hiv - associated dementia [ 16 ] .
inter - cellular adhesion molecule - 1 [ icam - 1 ] and vascular cell adhesion protein - 1 [ vcam - 1 ] are cleaved to their soluble forms following the activation of leukocytes or vascular endothelium .
both sicam - 1 and svcam - 1 are elevated in hiv infection [ 17 ] and associated with endothelial activation and / or an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [ 18 - 21 ] .
in addition to innate immune activation , adaptive immune activation is a hallmark of both aging and hiv - 1 infection .
most notably , both advancing age and hiv - 1 infection are associated with an increased frequency of memory cd4 + cd45ra - cd45ro + t cells as well as expanded cd4 + cd57 + and cd8 + cd57 + t cell populations .
cd57 - bearing t cells possess a unique inflammatory senescent phenotype , whereby the cells are able to produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines such as tnf but demonstrate impaired proliferation [ 22 , 23 ] .
in both aging and hiv - 1 infection , the direct cause of cd57 + t cell accumulation is unclear , although chronic viral replication , for example human cytomegalovirus , may drive the expansion of cd57 cells through immune attrition [ 24 ] .
the proper structure ( tissue composition ) and function ( strength & endurance ) of the lower extremities is vital for maintaining mobility in late life .
however , a paucity of research has investigated mobility functions and their determinants in hiv - infected older adults .
inflammation may provide a common link between hiv infection , aging and frailty .
both chronic hiv - 1 infection ( treated and untreated ) and aging - associated frailty are characterized by elevated levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines such as tnf and il - 6 [ 12 , 25 - 27 ] .
how the effects of hiv - 1 infection , aging and inflammation combine to affect physical function and body composition remain mostly unknown .
here , we determined the magnitude of hiv - associated inflammation while accounting for the traditional risk factors for age - related illness .
a key objective was to examine the relationships between biomarkers of inflammation and physical function and to understand whether hiv - 1 infection compounds the relationship between chronic inflammation and functional decline in older individuals .
the cohort included older hiv - infected individuals ( average age = 59.7 years , range 54 - 69 years ) undergoing suppressive art , compared to non - infected participants who were closely balanced for confounding variables including age , anthropometrics ( body mass index ) , co - morbidities ( e.g. , diabetes and cardiovascular disease ) and smoking status .
methods subject inclusion / exclusion and enrollment twenty - one hiv - infected participants were recruited from the gainesville veterans administration hiv clinic and the community at large .
all of the participants provided written informed consent based on documents approved by the university of florida institutional review board .
the protocols at malcom randall va medical center are approved concurrently through the university of florida irb .
the inclusion criteria were as follows : age >= 54 years old , well - controlled hiv on art for at least 12 months , cd4 > 100 cells / ul and plasma hiv rna < 5,000 copies .
combination regimens were either nrti - based ( efavirenz + ftc and tenofovir ; one case was treated with efavirenz + abacavir ) or protease inhibitor ( pi ) - based ( atazanavir , ritonavir , fosamprenavir , saquinavir or darunavir + ftc and tenofovir ) .
at the time of the study , 20 hiv - infected subjects had plasma hiv rna below 50 copies / ml ( the cutoff for the assay ) ; one subject had an hiv rna level of 208 copies per ml. the cd4 + t cell counts in the hiv - infected subjects were typically above 500 / mm3 ( mean = 560 , sd = 243 ) .
subjects were excluded from the study for any of the following criteria : active aids - defining illness , taking stavudine or zidovudine , hepatitis b or c infection , severe arthritis , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , severe congestive heart failure , low body mass index (< 20 kg / m2 ) , poorly controlled diabetes , treatment for cancer in the previous 6 months , peripheral vascular disease , parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , renal failure , use of anabolic steroids , cognitive impairment identified as having a mini - mental state exam score < 24 , or inflammatory disease ( rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , among others ) .
it was expected that there would be increased inflammation in the hiv - infected group , and elevated scd14 levels have been widely reported as a common feature of hiv - related inflammation [ 11 ]. with the goal of determining how inflammation relates to physical composition / function , we powered the study on plasma scd14 levels .
ten hiv - uninfected control participants were recruited after screening the hiv - infected subjects for plasma levels of scd14 .
the mean scd14 level of 21 hiv - infected subjects was 1,892 ng / ml ( sd = 394 ) .
using alpha = 0.05 , n = 9 provides 80 % power to detect a 25 % difference in scd14 levels between the groups .
hiv - infected subjects frequently develop age - related co - morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease , so a ' healthy ' non - hiv infected control group would not be suitable for comparison .
a self - report questionnaire was used to assess co - morbidities including cardiovascular conditions ( controlled hypertension , previous hospitalization for myocardial infarction , pacemaker , stroke or abnormal heart rhythm ) or respiratory conditions ( shortness of breath , asthma or recent chest congestion ) .
control participants were recruited from the community , enrolled after testing negative for hiv , and balanced to the hiv cases based on average age , body mass index , and smoking status , as well as the frequency of active diabetes , cardiovascular conditions and pulmonary conditions ( table 1 ) .
following the balancing approach , there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age , bmi , chronic diseases or the use of non - hiv medications related to chronic disease .

lps levels were quantified using the limulus amebocyte lysate [ lal ] chromogenic assay ( lonza inc. , allendale , nj ) as previously described [ 28 ] .
the plasma samples were diluted 1:4 in 0.15 m nacl prior to analysis , and the lower limit of detection was 0.1 endotoxin units [ eu ] per milliliter .
the following soluble markers of immune and endothelial activation were measured by elisa : scd14 , osteopontin [ opn ] , c - reactive protein [ crp ] , soluble icam - 1 [ sicam - 1 ] , svcam - 1 ( r & d systems inc. , minneapolis , mn ) , and il - 6 ( bd biosciences , san diego , ca ) .
the coagulation marker d - dimer was measured by elisa ( american diagnostica gmbh , stamford , ct ) .
flow cytometry analysis of cell surface phenotypes the following flow cytometry antibodies were purchased from bd biosciences ( san jose , ca ) : anti - cd3 - pe cy7 , anti - cd4 - alexa488 , anti - cd8 - pacblu , anti - cd28 - pe , anti - cd57 - apc , anti - cd45ro - alexa 700 , anti - hla - dr - apc , anti - cd14 - pacblu , anti - cd11a - fitc , anti - cd16 - pe - cy7 , anti - cd163 - pe , anti - cd62l - apc , and anti - cd86 - alexa 700 .
two multi - color panels were used for t cells , and two panels were used for monocytes .
data were collected using a bd lsrii flow cytometer and analyzed with fcs express software ( denovo software , los angeles , ca ) .
400 m rapid walk participants were asked to walk 400 m ( 20 m per lap ) at a rapid pace as described elsewhere [ 29 ] .
walking speed was calculated as the distance walked divided by the time elapsed .
at the end of each lap , the participants were asked about their physical exertion on a 0 ( none ) to 10 ( highest ) scale [ 30 ] .
lap variability may indicate fatigue and was calculated as the standard deviation in split times for each lap .
short physical performance battery ( sppb ) the sppb test is a common measure of physical performance in older adults and is described elsewhere [ 31 ] .
briefly , the test consists of timed measures of standing balance in three positions ( side by side position , semi tandem position , and tandem position ) , walking speed over 4 m , and time to stand up and sit down 5 times in a chair as quickly as possible .
each of the 3 performance measures was assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4 according to normative data published elsewhere [ 31 ] , with 4 indicating the highest level of performance , and 0 representing an inability to complete the test .
a summary score was created by adding each performance score ; the summary score therefore ranges from 0 to 12 .
excluding the balance test , values were reported for the speed ( or time ) to complete each task and score .
lower extremity tissue composition t1 - weighted 3d - magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) was used to quantify the tissue volumes of the right leg using a phillips 3.0 tesla magnet ( philips medical systems , bothell , wa ) as described previously [ 32 ] .
muscle , subcutaneous adipose tissue ( sat ) , and inter - muscular adipose tissue ( imat ) were measured volumetrically over 20 contiguous axial slices ( 10 in the mid - thigh and 10 in the mid - calf region ) as previously described by our group [ 33 ] .
values are expressed as the absolute volume in centimeters cubed ( cm3 ) and as a percent of the total volume .
mris were collected for 18 hiv cases and 10 non - infected controls .
lower extremity muscle strength and fatigue maximal knee extension and flexion isokinetic peak torque were measured using a biodex isokinetic dynamometer ( shirley , ny ) .
participants were asked to complete 50 concentric contractions at 90degrees / s with their right leg .
the peak torque ( in newton - meters ) and total work ( in joules ) achieved during the trials was used for the data analyses .
a fatigue index was calculated as the change in muscle work ( in joules ) during the first 16 repetitions ( the 1st third ) compared to the last 16 repetitions ( the last 3rd ) .
a negative value indicated a decrease in muscle work capacity in the final 16 repetitions .
statistical analyses for all parameters , outliers were detected using the grubb 's extreme studentized deviate [ esd ] method with an alpha value set at 0.01 .
after the outliers were removed , each parameter was tested for a normal distribution using the d'agostino & pearson omnibus normality test .
normally distributed parameters were compared using unpaired t - tests , and non - normally distributed parameters were compared by mann - whitney u - tests .
a total of 5 outlier values were detected and removed ; when the outliers were re - introduced and the analyses were re - run , no qualitative differences in outcomes or new significant differences were detected .
all of the reported data excluded outliers .
pearson 's correlation and simple linear regression were used to determine the relationships between two variables .
results innate immune activation in older hiv - infected individuals to determine the severity of innate immune activation , a panel of plasma biomarkers was assessed .
lps levels were similar in hiv - infected individuals and uninfected individuals ( table 2 ) .
likewise , some markers of immune activation / coagulation , including opn and d - dimer , were similar between the un - infected and infected groups .
trends toward elevated sicam1 ( p = 0.022 ) and svcam1 ( p = 0.009 ) were observed , but neither factor reached the significance threshold of p = 0.006 ( adjusted for multiple comparisons ) .
there were , however , significantly higher levels of scd14 , crp and il - 6 in the hiv - infected group compared to the uninfected group .

the underlined values are statistically significant at p < 0.006 ( adjusted for multiple comparisons ) ; the italicized values show a trend toward statistical significance at p < 0.05 we then compared individual markers of immune activation to determine whether elevated levels of soluble factors were correlated or independently regulated .
when a correlation matrix was applied , no association between plasma lps and any soluble marker of inflammation was found ( table 3 ) .
when each inflammatory marker was compared to the panel of markers , only svcam1 and sicam1 displayed the expected strong positive correlation ( r = 0.700 , p < 0.001 ) .

total pbmcs ( lymphocytes and monocytes ) were analyzed for the frequency of cd14 + monocytes in uninfected control and hiv - infected subjects ( fig. 1a ) .
the frequency of cd14 + monocytes in the total pbmcs was significantly lower in hiv - infected subjects ( fig. 1b ) .
monocyte activation was measured based on the expression of the cell surface proteins cd11a , cd16 , cd163 , cd62l , cd86 and hla - dr. despite significantly elevated scd14 levels in the plasma of hiv - infected subjects , there was no evidence that any of the activation markers differed in peripheral blood monocytes ( fig. 1c ). fig. 1 reduced frequency of monocytes among pbmcs from hiv - infected subjects .
a pbmc samples were analyzed by flow cytometry by first gating on the total mononuclear cells and then measuring the frequency of cd14 + cells for each individual ( representative subjects ) .
b the frequency of cd14 + monocytes among pbmcs from 21 hiv - infected subjects was compared to that of 10 uninfected controls using unpaired t - tests .
c using flow cytometry , the mean fluorescence intensity for a panel of monocyte maturation / activation markers was determined for cd14 + cells .
no differences were found between the groups t cell activation in hiv - infected subjects t cell senescence is characterized by the loss of cd28 expression and the increased expression of cd57 in cd4 or cd8 t cells [ 23 , 34 ] .
we found that in older hiv - infected subjects , the frequency of cd57 + t cells ( both cd4 + and cd8 +) was significantly elevated in comparison to uninfected subjects ( fig. 2a and d ) .
the cd57 + cells were further classified based on the expression of cd28 .
among cd4 + cells , the cd57 + cd28 + subset accounted for the difference observed in hiv - infected subjects ( p = 0.002 ) ( fig. 2b ) whereas no difference in the cd4 + cd57 + cd28 - population was found between uninfected and hiv - infected subjects ( p = 0.849 ) ( fig. 2c ) .
in contrast , among cd8 + t cells , the cd57 + cd28 + populations were similar between the uninfected and hiv groups ( p = 0.612 ) ( fig. 2e ) , but a higher frequency of cd8 + cd57 + cd28 - t cells was observed in the hiv - infected group ( p = 0.023 ) ( fig. 2f ) .
the frequencies of cd4 + cd57 + cd28 + and cd8 + cd57 + cd28 - cells were positively correlated in the hiv - infected subjects ( r = 0.512 , p = 0.025 ) ( data not shown ). fig. 2 increased frequency of cd57 - expressing cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in hiv - infected subjects .
pbmc samples were analyzed by flow cytometry by first gating on the total mononuclear cells and then on the cd3 + t cells .
the frequency of cd57 + cells among the ( a ) total cd4 + t cells , ( b ) cd28 - expressing cd4 + t cells or ( c ) cd28 - negative cd4 + t cells was determined .
next , the frequency of cd57 + cells among the ( d ) total cd8 + t cells , ( e ) cd28 - expressing cd8 + t cells or ( f ) cd28 - negative cd8 + t cells was determined using mann - whitney u - tests .
the error bars represent +/ - 1 sd one of the strongest correlates for cd4 + t cell decline in hiv infection is the increased frequency of memory / effector cd4 + cd45ro + t cells and a corresponding deficit in cd4 + cd45ra + naive t cells [ 28 , 35 , 36 ] .
in this cohort of older art - treated hiv subjects , there was no difference in the frequency of cd4 + cd45ro + t cells between the groups ( fig. 3a ) , yet the frequency of these memory / effector cells was inversely correlated with the peripheral blood cd4 + t cell counts in the hiv - infected individuals ( r = - 0.638 , p = 0.008 ) ( fig. 3b ) .
neither the cd4 + cd57 + cd28 + nor cd8 + cd57 + cd28 - t cell frequency was associated with the cd4 + t cell counts ( fig. 3c and d ). fig. 3 frequency of cd45ro - expressing memory cd4 + t cells , but not cd57 + cd4 + t cells , is associated with cd4 + t cell decline .
pbmc samples were analyzed by flow cytometry by first gating on the total mononuclear cells and then on the cd3 + t cells .
the frequency of ( a ) cd4 + cd45ro + t cells was then determined .
the correlations between total peripheral blood cd4 + t cell counts and ( b ) t cells cd4 + cd45ro + t cells , ( c ) cd4 + cd28 + cd57 + t cells , or ( d ) cd8 + cd28 - cd57 + t cells were determined ( pearson correlation ) physical composition and performance lower extremity tissue composition measurements were available for 18 of the 21 hiv - positive participants ( table 4 ) .
there were no significant differences in leg tissue volumes , and the measures of subcutaneous and intramuscular adiposity were similar between the hiv and control groups .
muscle strength and fatigue were similar between the control and hiv - infected groups , with no difference in knee extension peak torque , knee flexion peak torque , knee extension total work , knee flexion total work , knee extension fatigue index or knee flexion fatigue index .

when the components of the performance battery were examined separately , the hiv - infected subjects required more time to complete five chair stands compared to the uninfected controls ( 12.1 s vs 10.2 s , p = 0.047 ) , but otherwise both groups were similar across the individual components of the battery .
finally , both the control and hiv groups showed similar performances in the rapid walking test , with no significant differences in 400 - meter gait speed , average exertion or maximal exertion .
no differences were observed for peak knee extension and flexion or total knee extension and flexion .
overall , the physical performance of the control and hiv - infected groups was remarkably similar .
across all subjects and within hiv + and control groups , exhaustive correlation analyses were performed to compare each hiv - associated inflammatory biomarker ( scd14 , crl , il - 6 , cd57 + t cells ) with each measure of physical composition and performance .
no significant associations were detected for any of the comparisons ( data not shown ) .
thus , inflammation associated with hiv is not related to physical composition or function in this cohort of older - aged individuals .
discussion both hiv infection and normal aging in the absence of hiv - 1 infection are associated with chronic inflammation that negatively impacts overall health .
frailty develops earlier in hiv - infected individuals than uninfected individuals [ 37 , 38 ] , and a suspected source of increased frailty is chronic inflammation which develops early in hiv - 1 infection [ 39 ] .
in non - hiv - 1 - infected older persons , there is a well - established correlation between the biomarkers il - 6 , tnf and crp and frailty , as demonstrated in the newcastle 85 + study [ 40 ] , although no association between immunosenescence and frailty was detected .
in hiv - 1 infection , the vacs index , a multi - parameter score that combines biomarkers for hiv - 1 disease and organ system injury but not inflammation , predicts frailty [ 41 ] .
here , we investigated how hiv infection augments the inflammation that occurs normally in older individuals with the goal of understanding whether potentially additive inflammatory effects of hiv - 1 and advancing age accelerate the development of frailty .
our understanding of the effects of hiv - 1 and advancing age on systemic inflammation may be confounded by additional factors including obesity , age - related co - morbidities , behaviors ( e.g. , smoking ) and non - hiv medications .
we carefully balanced hiv - 1 - infected and un - infected subjects for these factors and found that hiv - 1 infection , even with suppressive antiretroviral therapy , is associated with a number of unique inflammatory phenotypes compared to a control group with similar co - morbidity and medication profiles .
as a population , the hiv - 1 - infected group had significantly elevated levels of plasma scd14 , crp and il - 6 compared to the uninfected controls .
although they failed to reach statistical significance , modestly elevated levels of sicam1 and svcam1 , markers of endothelial activation , were observed in the hiv - infected subjects .
our previous studies in infected and uninfected young adults revealed similar differences in svcam levels [ 42 ] .
based on our previous work and that of others [ 7 , 9 , 28 , 43 - 47 ] , we hypothesized that plasma lps levels would be elevated in older hiv - infected subjects compared to uninfected subjects , however , lps levels were similar in both groups .
our previous studies of microbial translocation focused on much younger individuals ( infants and children ) , among whom there were clear differences in lps levels in hiv - 1 - infected children compared to uninfected children [ 28 ] .
the similar levels of plasma lps among the uninfected and hiv - 1 - infected older individuals was surprising , but we can speculate that there may be age - related differences in intestinal permeability and microbial translocation ( even in the absence of hiv - 1 infection ) that mask the biomarkers of gut pathology that are easily detected in younger cohorts .
alternatively , co - morbidities such as diabetes , heart disease or kidney disease , which were prevalent among both the hiv - infected and uninfected groups , may be associated with microbial translocation .
for example , endotoxemia is associated with atherosclerosis in non - hiv - infected subjects [ 48 ] .
elevated levels of plasma scd14 are clearly associated with poorer health status and health outcomes in hiv patients [ 7 , 11 , 49 ] .
while the source of scd14 is attributed to systemic monocyte / macrophage activation , there is little evidence to implicate peripheral blood monocytes versus tissue macrophages in the elevated production of scd14 .
one recent study in younger subjects ( median age = 41 years ) found a positive correlation between plasma levels of il - 6 , d - dimer , crp , or scd163 and multiple phenotypic alterations in peripheral blood monocytes , including the frequency of cd16 + monocytes [ 50 ] .
we found no evidence of monocyte phenotypic alterations in hiv - infected subjects despite markedly elevated plasma levels of scd14 .
we did find , however , that hiv - infected subjects had a reduced frequency of peripheral blood monocytes compared to uninfected subjects. whether the association between high scd14 and a low frequency of circulating monocytes is due to an increased rate of monocyte extravasation or apoptosis or alternatively to reduced production from bone marrow precursors remains unknown .
our previous study showed that human peripheral blood monocytes produce relatively higher levels of scd14 in comparison to macrophages , yet only macrophages responded to lps by releasing more scd14 [ 51 ] .
together , these findings suggest that elevated scd14 in older individuals may originate from tissue macrophages rather than monocytes .
the expansion of cd57 - expressing t cells is typical of both hiv infection and advancing age [ 34 ] .
in cd57 + cells specific for hiv antigens , replicative senescence arises from chronic antigenic exposure ; this effect is similar to that observed in chronic infection with cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) associated with an increased frequency of both cd4 + and cd8 + t cells expressing cd57 [ 52 ] .
in healthy populations , the proportion of cd8 + cd57 + t cells expands with increasing age [ 53 ] .
the combined effects of age and cmv infection result in an accumulation of cd8 + cd57 + t cells lacking the co - stimulatory molecule cd28 [ 54 ] .
we observed a significant increase in the proportion of cd8 + cd28 - cd57 + but not cd8 + cd28 + cd57 + t cells in the hiv cohort .
the cmv status of both hiv - infected and control groups was unknown , so the cause of expanded senescent cd8 + t cells requires further investigation .
similar to cd8 + t cells , the expansion of cd4 + cd57 + cd28 - t cells is associated with chronic viral infections [ 55 - 57 ] .
we found an increase in the frequency of cd4 + cd57 + cd28 + t cells in hiv - infected subjects but no difference in cd4 + cd57 + cd28 - t cells .
expansion of cd57 - expressing t cells occurred independently of the total cd4 t cell number in hiv - infected subjects .
instead , the increased frequency of memory cd4 + cd45ro + t cells was associated with decreased cd4 + t cell numbers .
this finding is in accordance with another study showing that increasing age and the concomitant reduced production of naive cd4 + t cells , rather than the expansion of senescent cd57 + t cells , underlies the deficit in cd4 t cell reconstitution observed in younger , treated hiv patients [ 24 ] .
we anticipated that hiv disease would result in some degree of frailty and / or reduced physical performance compared to similarly - aged uninfected control subjects .
frailty is a common trait of hiv - 1 infection and has been linked to numerous causes including chronic inflammation , polypharmacy , and coagulopathy [ 39 , 58 ] .
here , the control and hiv groups demonstrated nearly identical physical characteristics with similar leg tissue volume and adiposity .
strength , fitness and fatigue measures were also highly similar between the groups .
frailty in hiv - 1 infection is strongly correlated with a high viral load and cd4 + t cell decline [ 38 , 41 ] , whereas lipodystrophy syndrome and fat redistribution are associated with combination antiretroviral therapy [ 59 ] .
the patients in our study had well - controlled viremia and stable cd4 + t cell counts , which may in part explain the similarities in leg musculature between the uninfected and infected groups .
it is well established that antiretroviral therapy can cause redistribution of limb fat to the trunk [ 59 ] or increased visceral fat within the limbs [ 60 ] , but no change in leg adiposity was observed in our hiv - 1 - infected group .
it is possible that the variability in measurable lipodystrophy in the hiv - 1 infected individuals ( estimates range from 13 to 70 % [ 59 ]) is too great to observe changes on our relatively small cohort .
in addition , exclusion of subjects taking the nrti drugs stavudine or zidovudine may explain the similarities in adiposity , because hiv - associated lipoatrophy has been related to exposure to these drugs [ 61 ] .
despite strong evidence for increased inflammation in the hiv - 1 group , the infected and uninfected groups had similar muscle and physical performance characteristics .
thus , although inflammation is a characteristic of aging - related frailty and hiv - 1 infection , our study suggests that increased inflammation in older hiv - 1 - infected individuals causes no greater frailty than what is found in similarly aged uninfected individuals .
ours is the first study that we know of where older uninfected and hiv - 1 - infected individuals were carefully balanced for age - related co - morbidities and medications to specifically assess the role of hiv - associated inflammation in frailty .
a major limitation of our conclusion is that the study size is small ; this work should be repeated in larger studies .
nonetheless , inflammation was profoundly elevated in the hiv - 1 - infected group , so we accept this as convincing evidence that inflammation alone does not always lead to frailty .
conclusions hiv infection is thought to augment the inflammatory consequences of advancing age , with many of the health challenges of old age being faced by far younger infected adults .
however , hiv infection is no longer a disease of youth .
improvements in therapy are resulting in a predictable " aging up " of the hiv - infected population .
in the state of florida , the location of our current study , the percentage of total hiv cases among people over the age of 50 years increased from 15 % in 2007 to 23 % in 2011 [ 62 , 63 ] .
as new interventions are sought to optimize the long - term care of aging hiv patients , it is important to appreciate the specific causes of morbidity / mortality that impact quality and length of life .
frailty is a characteristic of normal aging , and this process is accelerated in hiv - 1 infection .
it has been speculated that the common denominator between age - associated and hiv - associated frailty is excessive inflammation .
our study argues that hiv - 1 - associated inflammation may not lead to any greater frailty than what would be found in similarly - aged uninfected individuals when controlling for other health problems .
understanding the specific mechanisms that underlie age - related illnesses in older hiv - 1 - infected individuals will be of greater importance in the future as this population ages .

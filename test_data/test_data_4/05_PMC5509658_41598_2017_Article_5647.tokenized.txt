connexins play essential roles in lens homeostasis and development .
here , we identified a new role for cx50 that mediates cell - cell adhesion function .
cx50 enhanced the adhesive capability of aqp0 .
interestingly , the expression of cx50 alone promoted cell adhesion at a comparable level to aqp0 ; however , this cell adhesive function was not observed with other lens connexins , cx43 and cx46 .
moreover , the adhesive property occurred in both homotypic with cx50 expressed in both pairing cells and heterotypic with cx50 in only one pairing cell , and this function appears to be unrelated to its role in forming gap junction channels .
cx50 ko lenses exhibited increased intercellular spaces between lens fiber cells .
the second extracellular loop domain ( e2 ) is primarily responsible for this adhesive function .
treatment with a fusion protein containing e2 domain inhibited cell adhesion .
furthermore , disruption of cell adhesion by the e2 domains impaired primary lens cell differentiation .
five critical amino acid residues in the e2 domain primarily are involved in cell adhesive function as well as lens epithelial - fiber differentiation .
together , these results suggest that in addition to forming gap junction channels , cx50 acts as an adhesive molecule that is critical in maintaining lens fiber integrity and epithelial - fiber differentiation .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction gap junctions that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells and permit passage of metabolites , ions and second messengers play essential roles in lens homeostasis and transparency .
gap junctions are formed by a family of membrane proteins called connexins1 , which have four conserved transmembrane and two extracellular loop ( e ) domains and , a variable intracellular loop ( il ) and a c - terminal ( ct ) domains .
three major connexins have been identified in the vertebrate lens ; cx43 , cx46 and cx50 .
mutations of cx46 and cx50 genes are the most common causes of congenital cataracts in humans .
similar lens phenotypes ware reported in connexin - deficient or mutation murine models2 , 3 .
our previous studies have shown that cx50 , but not cx46 or cx43 , associates with aquaporin 0 ( aqp0 ) , the most abundant membrane protein in the differentiating , but not mature lens fibers4 .
this interaction promotes gap junctional channel activity5 , and the il domain of cx50 and the ct domain of aqp0 directly interact with each other6 .
the lens is an avascular organ , which is formed by an anterior epithelial cell layer and highly differentiated fiber cells .
epithelial cells located at the lens equator differentiate to lens fiber cells , which gradually lose their intracellular nuclei and organelles in lens development .
during this process , mature lens fibers accumulate high concentrations of aqp0 , crystallins , cx46 and cx50 .
because of the lack of vasculature , the lens is dependent upon an extensive network of gap junction intercellular communication to maintain lens homeostasis7 .
aqp0 , also known as major intrinsic protein ( mip ) , is the most abundant membrane protein expressed in lens fibers .
however , unlike other members of aquaporin family , water permeability of mammalian aqp0 is remarkably low , estimated to be 40 - times lower than that of the aqp1 channel in lens anterior epithelial cells8 , while zebrafish aqp0 has high water permeability similar to mammalian aqp19 .
besides functioning as a water channel , aqp0 plays a crucial structural role as an adhesion molecule in mediating the formation of thin junctions between lens fibers10 - 13 .
in addition , aqp0 interacts with several proteins , such as calmodulin14 , intermediate filament proteins filensin and cp4915 , as well as gamma - crystallins16 , 17 .
although connexin molecules have been implied to be involved in facilitating cell - cell interaction due to their formation of gap junctions between adjacent cells , there is a scarcity of knowledge with regards to the direct cell adhesive function of connexins .
in this study , we show that cx50 , unlike two other lens connexins , cx43 and cx46 , mediates cell adhesion function through its second extracellular loop domain .
moreover , the cell - cell adhesion mediated by cx50 plays a critical role for lens epithelial - fiber cell differentiation .
results cx50 exhibits cell - cell adhesion function and enhances the adhesive capability of aqp0 we have shown that cx50 interaction with aqp0 enhances gap junctional coupling5 , 6 .
to explore if cx50 has any effect on the cell adhesion function of aqp0 , we conducted a cell adhesion assay using chicken embryonic fibroblast ( cef ) cells , a cell line deficient in lens connexins and aqp018 , and cannot form functional gap junction channels between themselves and between parental cef and the cef expressing exogenous cx50 ( fig. s1 ) .
exogenous cx50 and aqp0 were expressed in cef cells via retroviral infection ( fig. 1a ) .
the cell adhesion assay was then performed by " parachuting " dil - labeled donor cells to the confluent recipient cells as illustrated in fig. 1b .
we expressed cx50 and / or aqp0 in various combinations in donor and receipt cells .
as compared to cef cells only ( c ) and rcas ( a ) vehicle ( v ) controls , the presence of aqp0 significantly increased the number of adherent cells when it was expressed in both donor and recipient cells ( homotypic ) ( fig. 1c ) as well as when it was only present in either recipient or donor cells ( heterotypic ) ( fig. 1d and e ) .
similarly , co - expression of aqp0 with cx50 further enhanced the numbers of adherent cells when expressed in a heterotypic or homotypic manner ( fig. 1c - e ) .
surprisingly , we observed that cx50 , by itself , significantly increased cell adhesion , and also acted in either a homotypic or heterotypic manner ( fig. 1c - e ) .
there is no statistical difference when comparing the cell adhesion by homotypic aqp0 and cx50 .
these results suggest that co - expression of cx50 further enhances the adhesive function of aqp0 and more importantly , cx50 by itself possess cell adhesion function similar to aqp0 .
figure 1 cx50 increases cell - cell adhesion and enhances the adhesive capability of aqp0 .
( a ) crude membrane extracts were prepared from cef cells infected with high titer rcas ( a ) retroviral vehicle ( v ) or recombinant rcas ( a ) retroviruses containing cx50 , aqp0 or co - infected with both cx50 and aqp0 and were immunoblotted with anti - flag or beta - actin antibody .

to determine if this cell adhesion property is unique to cx50 , we examined two other lens connexins , cx43 and cx46 .
western blots showed that all three exogenous connexins or in combinations were expressed in cef cells following retroviral transfection ( fig. 2a ) and co - expression reduced the level of the ones expressed alone as we have previously observed18 - 20 .
however , unlike cx50 , cx43 and cx46 did not function as adhesive molecules in either a homotypic or heterotypic manner ( fig. 2b ) .
moreover , co - expression of cx43 or cx46 with aqp0 failed to further enhance the the adhesive function of aqp0 .
given that these connexins also form gap junctions between two adjacent cells , the cell adhesion function of cx50 could be a result of the formation of gap junctions .
the lack of cell adhesion function by cx43 or cx46 could be due to insufficient time necessary to form gap junctions .
to explore this possibility , we conducted cell adhesion assay by counting dil - labeled adherent cells " parachuting " on recipient cells at various time periods up to 6 hrs .
there was a significant increase in cell adhesion within the first 1.5 hrs in cells expressing aqp0 or cx50 , whereas there was a minimal effect in cx43 or cx46 - expressing cells that was similar to the rcas ( a ) vehicle ( v ) control ( fig. 2c ) .
the difference was clearly shown in representative images of dil - labeled fluorescent , adherent cells after 1.5 hrs of incubation ( fig. 2d ) .
to further confirm that the adhesive function is solely due to cx50 and not the other lens connexins , we also performed the cell - to - cell adhesion assay through the heterotypic pairing of connexins ( fig. 2e ) .
the result showed that only cells expressing cx50 , regardless of its homotypic or heterotypic expression , exhibited increased cell adhesion .
intriguingly , more adherent cells were observed in cells expressing heterotypic cx50 paired with rcas ( a ) vehicle ( v ) control cells than those paired with cx43 or cx46 - expressing cells .
these data indicate that expression of cx43 or cx46 on the cell membrane may interfere with cx50 heterotypic adhesion to other , non - connexin partner ( s ) on the adjacent cell membrane .
figure 2 cx50 , not the other two lens connexins , cx43 and cx46 , mediates cell - cell adhesion , and cell adhesion function is independent of cx50 channel - forming function .

the above evidence indicates that the cell adhesion function of cx50 appears to be unrelated to its role in forming functional gap junctions , given that both cx43 and cx46 also form functional gap junction channels in cef cells21 .
we further explored this assertion using a cx50 mutant , p88s , that expresses on the surface of differentiated lens fibers and impairs the ability of cx50 to form functional gap junction channels and hemichannels18 , 22 .
we also showed cell surface localization of this mutant in cef cells ( fig. s2 ) .
however , like wt cx50 , the mutant cx50p88s had comparable cell adhesive capability and also functioned in both a homotypic and heterotypic adhesion manner ( fig. 2f ) .
together , these results suggest that only cx50 , and not the other lens connexins , acts as a cell adhesive molecule , which has a role different from forming gap junction channels .
the second extracellular loop domain ( e2 ) is involved in the adhesion function of cx50 connexins have two extracellular loop domains , e1 and e2 .
the sequences of cx50 e1 and e2 domains , and their sequence comparisons with e1 and e2 domains of cx43 , cx46 and cx26 , respectively are illustrated ( table 1 ) .
to determine which domain ( s ) mediates cell adhesion function , we generated gst fusion protein containing the e1 or e2 domain of cx50 , or gst as a control ( fig. 3a ) , and tested its interaction with connexins and effect on cell adhesion mediated by cx50 .
protein pull - down assay using e1 , e2 gst - fusion protein or gst as a control showed that e2 , not e1 fusion protein or gst , interacted with cx50 and this interaction was not detected in cell lysates containing cx46 ( fig. 3b ) .

cef cells expressing homotypic or heterotypic cx50 were pre - incubated with the aforementioned fusion proteins or gst control and the cell adhesion assay was performed .
we determined the half - lives of cx50 e1 and e2 - gst proteins in cef cells expressing cx50 and found these two fusion proteins are stable in cell culture with half - lives of 30.6 +/ - 4.5 and 36.4 +/ - 3.5 hrs , respectively ( fig. s4 ) .
the fusion proteins were added to the cell every day .
addition of the gst fusion protein containing e2 ( e2 - gst ) significantly attenuated the enhancement of cell adhesion by cx50 , while the e1 - gst and gst had no such effect ( fig. 3c ) .
we also observed a similar inhibitory effect on cell adhesion in cells expressing cx50p88s mutant .
however , this effect was not shown in cells expressing aqp0 , suggesting that the inhibition of cell adhesion by e2 - gst was specific to cx50 .
we further confirm the adhesive role of cx50 in other cell types .
the mouse ortholog of cx50 was expressed in hek193 cells via lentiviral infection and cell adhesion assay was similarly performed .
the increased adhesive function by cx50 was similarly observed in both heterotypic and homotypic manner ( fig. 4a ) .
given that extracellular loop domains of cx50 are highly homologous between chicken and mouse , application of the same e1 or e2 - gst fusion proteins showed the similar inhibition by e2 , but not e1 - gst or gst .
together , these data suggest that e2 domain plays an important role in mediating cell adhesion function of cx50 .

we examined the microscopic organization of fiber cells in cx50 knockout mice .
h & e staining of postnatal day - 15 mouse lenses showed that compared to wt lenses , cx50 ko lenses showed disorganized lens fiber structures with some empty spaces , particularly close to the anterior ( fig. 4b ) and posterior regions of the lens .
thin section electron microscopy results revealed the presence of numerous vacuole structures between the lens fibers and increased intercellular spaces ( arrows ) in cx50 knockout lenses ( fig. 4c ) .
consistently , a recent paper also reports multiple morphological defects in the cortical fibers of cx50 knockout lenses23 .
the increase of extracellular spaces is also reported in the lens fibers lacking aqp024 .
together , these data support an important role of cx50 in cell adhesion , which likely leads to the integrity and compact organization of lens fibers .
cell adhesion by cx50 plays an important role in lens epithelial - fiber cell differentiation cx50 is directly involved in lens epithelial to fiber cell differentiation as well as lens development based on both in vivo ko models and in vitro studies with primary lens cells25 - 27 .
here , we explored if the cell adhesion function of cx50 is crucial to lens fiber differentiation .
cultured chick lens primary cells undergo morphological changes associated with the formation of lentoid structures and the expression of lens differentiation marker proteins , a process closely mimicking lens epithelial to fiber cell differentiation in situ 28 .
we treated these primary cultures with a gst fusion protein containing either the e1 or e2 domain of cx50 or gst as control starting at the 3 - 4th day after cell seeding .
lentoids started to emerge around day 6 and continued until day 14 .
representative images of lentoids were taken ( fig. 5a , left panels ) and the number of lentoids was counted each day ( fig. 5a , right panel ) .
the lentoid numbers were reduced in cultures treated with e2 - gst while the untreated control , e1 - gst - or gst - treated cultures had similar , time - dependent increases in lentoid numbers .
to further quantify the extent of lens cell differentiation , we examined the expression level of aqp0 , a marker for lens cell differentiation and maturation , at day 14 after primary cell culturing .
immunofluorescence images showed a reduction of aqp0 expression only in e2 - gst treated cells , but not in those treated with e1 - gst , gst or untreated control ( fig. 5b , left panels ) .
quantification of fluorescence intensity further confirmed the decrease of aqp0 expression ( fig. 5b , right panel ) .
these data suggest that cx50 - mediated cell adhesion plays a critical role in lens epithelial to fiber cell differentiation .

identification of amino acid residues at e2 domain in cell adhesive and lens cell differentiation function of cx50 to determine the critical amino acid residues that are involved in cell adhesion and lens fiber differentiation , we mutated 8 conserved amino acid residues located in e2 domains ; 3 cysteine conserved residues important for the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds between e1 and e2 domains , and 5 residues which are conserved in cx50 across species by site - directed mutagenesis .
we generated gst fusion proteins with mutation of these residues to alanine .
cell adhesion assay was performed in cx50 - expressing cef cells in the absence or presence of gst fusion proteins containing wt or mutant e2 domains .
the comparable levels of e2 - gst fusion proteins containing various single site mutation or wt ( fig. 6a ) were incubated with cef cells expressing cx50 in heterotypic or homotypic manner or rcas ( a ) vehicle ( v ) control .
mutant fusion proteins c196a , p201a and e203a had significant inhibition on cell adhesion as that containing wt e2 domain , while c185a , c190a , r200a , t202a and k204a had no such effects ( fig. 6b and summarized in table 2 ) .
additionally , we found a similar level of the inhibition of cx50 adhesion by cx43e2 fusion protein that also contains these five conserved residues ( fig. s5 ) .
the e2 fusion proteins containing these site mutations were applied to lens primary culture and the extent of lens cell differentiation was analyzed .
consistent with the result of cell adhesion , the identical 5 mutants of e2 domain failed to attenuate the inhibitory effect of e2 - gst on lens fiber differentiation , indicated by the expression of aqp0 ( fig. 6c ) .
these data support the notion that cell adhesion function mediated by critical amino acid residues of e2 domain is indispensable for lens fiber cell differentiation .

we previously reported the role of aqp0 in promoting gap junction coupling mediated by cx505 .
however , the potential involvement of cx50 in the role of aqp0 in cell adhesion function remains largely elusive .
our cell - to - cell adhesion assay showed that co - expression of aqp0 and cx50 further enhanced the adhesive function of aqp0 .
interestingly , cx50 by itself acts as an adhesive molecule and its adhesive capacity is comparable to that of aqp0 .
this is the first time that cx50 has been shown to function as an adhesive molecule besides its role in forming connexin channels .
the enlarged intercellular spaces between fiber cells observed in the lens of cx50 ko mice are likely to be a consequence of deficient adhesive function of cx50 .
interestingly , this adhesive function acts in both homotypic ( with both pairing cells expressing cx50 ) and heterotypic ( either donor or recipient cell expressing cx50 ) fashion .
these data indicate that gap junction formation requiring connexin expression in both paired cells is unlikely to be involved in the process of cell adhesion .
to test this possibility and the specificity of cell adhesion by cx50 , we used cx43 and cx46 , the other two connexins present in the lens .
unlike cx50 , these two connexins failed to exhibit any cell adhesive function , given that cx43 and cx46 form gap junctions and mediate cell - cell coupling5 .
we then conducted dynamic cell - cell adhesion studies to explore the possibility that the formation of gap junctions between two adjacent cells by the other lens connexins may take a longer period of time than cx50 .
however , the data showed a time - dependent increase in cell adhesion only in cx50 and not the other lens connexin - expressing cells , further eliminating the involvement of gap junction formation in cell - cell adhesion .
the cell adhesive function of connexins has been proposed over the decades , particularly because they have a close association with other cell adhesion proteins including tight junction proteins , cadherins and other cytoskeletal proteins30 .
for example , gap junctions are suggested to function analogously to cell adhesion molecules in mediating cellular recognition and selective neurite adhesion and repulsion31 .
however , these reported adhesive properties are primarily dependent upon the establishment of gap junction structures with the expression of the same connexin in both paired cells32 .
we further excluded the involvement of functional gap junction coupling since the cx50p88s mutant that fails to mediate cell coupling possesses the same adhesive capability as wt cx50 .
this study also diminishes the possible involvement of functional hemichannels since cx50p88s mutant also inhibits this type of connexin channel in a dominant negative manner in both cef cells and primary lens cells18 , 22 .
moreover , adhesion function by cx50 does not require a connexin partner from neighboring cells .
cx50 mediates heterotypic adhesion and , intriguingly , the expression of other lens connexins in the partner cell is able to reduce the adhesive effect of cx50 .
it is likely that the expression of other connexins on the cell surface may partially interfere with the interaction of the adhesion partner molecule ( s ) with cx50 .
the adhesion partner ( s ) may not necessarily be a protein as the involvement of other molecules on the cell surface such as lipids or carbohydrates cannot be excluded .
additionally , we found that mutation of two positively charged amino acid residues at the e2 domain abolished adhesive function of cx50 , which implies the possible interaction between extracellular positively charged residues of cx50 and negatively charged lipid bilayers .
further investigation in this area is warranted .
there are two extracellular loop domains ( e1 and e2 ) of connexin molecules with the e1 domain involved in the formation of the gap junction channel and e2 in the docking compatibility in heterotypic gap junction channels ( see review ref. 33 ) .
deletion of either extracellular domain impairs protein stability and intracellular delivery of connexin molecules to the cell surface34 .
here , we used a competition assay with the fusion proteins containing either the e1 or e2 domain in order to define the involvement of a specific extracellular domain .
we found that only the e2 domain inhibited cell - cell adhesion whereas e1 had a minimal effect .
the effect of the e2 domain is specific for cx50 as this domain does not inhibit cell adhesion mediated by aqp0 .
we identified 5 amino acid residues by which mutating any one of them compromised the capability of e2 fusion protein in the inhibition of cell adhesion as well as lens cell differentiation .
these five residues are conserved among connexin subtypes .
a similar level of the inhibition of cx50 adhesion was also observed with cx43e2 fusion protein , which suggests that cx43 e2 domain with those conserved residues like cx50e2 , is likely to disrupt these interactions .
these data support the notion that several conserved residues of e2 domain are involved in the adhesion function of cx50 .
it is likely that other unique residues on cx50 might interact with these conserved residues to mediate the adhesive function .
four out five residues ( except c190 ) are located in the protein motifs containing either alpha - helix or beta - sheet ; two are positively charged and one is involved in forming a hydrogen bond .
two residues that abolish the inhibitory effect of e2 - gst are c185 and c190 .
according to the cx26 hemichannel structure ( formed by 6 monomers ) , cysteines in the 2nd extracellular loop domains are engaged in formation of disulfide bonds with cysteines in the 1st extracellular loop of the same monomer .
the sequence comparison of e2 and 4th transmembrane domains of cx26 and cx50 and structure predictions are shown in fig. s3 .
because there are 3 cysteines in e2 , it is possible that in the e2 - gst fusion protein c185 and c190 formed disulfide bonds with other cysteines in the same or a different e2 domain of cx50 .
the cysteines are conserved residues in the e2 domain .
it is possible that the cysteines and the critical residues identified in cx50 , may interact with other residue ( s ) , not in the other two connexins , critical for forming certain unique structure to mediate cell - cell adhesion .
the secondary structures of e2 domain and electrostatic interactions may play crucial roles in facilitating the adhesive function of cx50 with either the partner cx50 or possibly negatively charged phospholipids or other proteins from neighboring cells .
cx50 , unlike cx46 , the other connexin predominantly expressed in lens fibers , plays an important role in lens development and lens epithelial to fiber cell differentiation , and cx50 deficiency results in a small lens25 - 27 , 35 .
we also show in our earlier study that the c - terminus of cx50 is involved in promoting lens cell differentiation .
however , cx50 c - terminus along is not sufficient for lens cell differentiation .
cell - cell adhesion is known to be crucial for the process of normal cell proliferation and differentiation .
in this study , we show that cell - cell adhesion mediated by cx50 is an important part in the process of lens cell differentiation .
primary chick lens cultures undergo an autonomous program of cell differentiation , in which monolayer epithelial cells gradually differentiate into lens fiber - like cells with the formation of lentoids structures and the expression of lens fiber cell markers including aqp0 and crystallin molecules28 , 36. by taking advantage of this system , we found that the e2 domain , which disrupted the cell - cell adhesion by cx50 , compromised lens cell differentiation with the reduction of lentoid formation and expression of aqp0 .
furthermore , we showed that identical group of amino acid residues on cx50 e2 domain participate for both cell adhesion and lens cell differentiation , supporting the notion that cell adhesive function of cx50 directly influences lens cell differentiation .
together , this study uncovers a unique mechanism for cx50 in cell adhesion , which is likely to play a crucial role in lens cell differentiation and development .

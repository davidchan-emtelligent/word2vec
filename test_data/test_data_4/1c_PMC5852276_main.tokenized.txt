this original clinical research study id focused on description of baseline anatomy and outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( tavi ) in patients presenting with severe aortic stenosis ( as ) and bicuspid aortic valve ( bav ) .
we compared this bav population with a population of patients with as and tricuspid aortic valves after a propensity score matching developed by a multivariate logistic regression according to a non - parsimonious approach .
baseline anatomical characteristics were obtained by transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) and multi - sliced computed tomography ( msct ) and compared by chi - square and t - student tests .
outcomes were evaluated by correct fisher test at in hospital and 30 days follow - up. we found that bav patients presents more complicated baseline anatomy as compared to patients with tricuspid valves .
these anatomical features lead to higher procedural complications as the need for a second device implantation .
however this does not translate into increase in mortality rate at 30 days follow - up but rather correlate to a lower device success rate .

value of the data * aortic stenosis in bicuspid aortic valve ( bav ) remains a challenge for transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( tavi ) .
* bav patients presenting severe aortic stenosis are increasing in clinical practice * there is little evidence concerning tavi in this population .
* our data can be an additional evidence for the feasibility of tavi in bav .
* indeed many questions are still open to optimize the sizing and find some dedicated devices for this population .
registries and sizing comparisons between operators could find a way to improve tavi procedures in this subset .
1 data - this study is a comparison analysis between patients with bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valves undergoing tavi for severe as .
- patients with as and bav present more complicated baseline anatomy as compared to patients with tricuspid valves .
- these anatomical features correlate to a lower device success rate but are not related to increase in mortality rate at 30 days follow - up .
- the lower device success rate reported was mainly related to a second device implantation need since nor pvl or mean gradient and mortality rate were significantly different .
- pre - procedural imaging and novel device technologies will help to address proper sizing and valve choice in the future .
2 experimental design , materials , and methods from january to december 2016 , 460 patients with tricuspid aortic valve underwent tavi procedure in our institution for symptomatic severe as. from january 2015 to april 2017 , 83 consecutive patients with bav had tavi at our institution .
the majority of these patients were indeed treated in 2016 ( 87 %) .
patients undergoing tavi due to bio - prosthesis degeneration were not included .
bav were classified following the sievers classification as reported in fig. 1 [ 1 ] .
multi - detector computed tomography ( mdct ) and transthoracic echocardiogram ( tte ) were assessed at baseline .
bav anatomy was identified by baseline mdct after analysis using the 3mensio structural heart software version 8.0 ( pie medical imaging , maastricht , the netherlands ) workstation software .
mdct was the method of choice for sizing using the perimeter - derived diameter of the aortic annulus .
in the bav group , we used as additional measurement for sizing the inter - commissural distance 4 mm above the annulus. fig. 1 bicuspid valve anatomy .
l - n : left - non coronary cusps ; l - r : left - right cusps ; r - n : right - non coronary cusps. fig. 1 continue variables were compared using a student 's t test and categorical variables with a chi - square test .
a propensity - score matching was applied to account for differences in baseline characteristics of both groups .
a 1:2 propensity - score matching was performed on the basis of clinical risk factors for cardiovascular mortality and was developed by a multivariate logistic regression according to a non - parsimonious approach [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
a total amount of 249 patients , 83 with bicuspid and 166 with tricuspid aortic valve , were included in the final analysis .
baseline anatomical features and procedural characteristics were compared between the two groups as previously described .
outcomes were evaluated following the valve academic research consortium - 2 definitions ( varc ) - 2 definitions .
ppm values were classified into mild , moderate , severe and were analyzed at both in - hospital and 30 days follow - up [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] as reported in fig. 2. device success was evaluated at in - hospital follow - up and the early safety at 30 days [ 8 ]. fig. 2 in - hospital and 30 days prosthesis - patient mismatch ( ppm ). fig. 2 the primary endpoint was all - cause mortality and early safety at 30 days .
secondary endpoint included device success .
statistical significance was considered as p value <= 0.05 .
all results were obtained using the statistical package for the social sciences version 21.0 ( spss v21.0 , spss inc , chicago , il ) .

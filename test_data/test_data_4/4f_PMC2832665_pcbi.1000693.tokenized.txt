the presence of amyloid deposits consisting primarily of amyloid - beta ( abeta ) fibril in the brain is a hallmark of alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) .
the morphologies of these fibrils are exquisitely sensitive to environmental conditions .
using molecular dynamics simulations combined with data from previously published solid - state nmr experiments , we propose the first atomically detailed structures of two asymmetric polymorphs of the abeta9 - 40 peptide fibril .
the first corresponds to synthetic fibrils grown under quiescent conditions and the second to fibrils derived from ad patients' brain - extracts .
our core structure in both fibril structures consists of a layered structure in which three cross - beta subunits are arranged in six tightly stacked beta - sheet layers with an antiparallel hydrophobic - hydrophobic and an antiparallel polar - polar interface .
the synthetic and brain - derived structures differ primarily in the side - chain orientation of one beta - strand .
the presence of a large and continually exposed hydrophobic surface ( buried in the symmetric agitated abeta fibrils ) may account for the higher toxicity of the asymmetric fibrils .
our model explains the effects of external perturbations on the fibril lateral architecture as well as the fibrillogenesis inhibiting action of amphiphilic molecules .
author summary amyloid diseases are characterized by the presence of amyloid fibrils on organs and tissue in the body .
alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's diseases and type ii diabetes are all examples of amyloid diseases .
determining the structure of amyloid fibrils is critical for understanding the mechanism of fibril formation as well as for the design of inhibitor molecules that can prevent aggregation .
in the case of the alzheimer amyloid - beta ( abeta ) peptide , the structure of fibrils grown under conditions of mechanical agitation has been elucidated from a combination of simulation and experiments .
however , the structures of the asymmetric quiescent abeta fibrils ( grown under conditions akin to physiological conditions ) and of alzheimer 's brain - derived fibrils are not known .
in this paper , we propose the first atomically detailed structures of these two fibrils , using molecular dynamics simulations combined with data from previously published experiments .
in additions , we suggest a unifying lateral growth mechanism that explains the increased toxicity of quiescent abeta fibrils , the effects of external perturbations on fibril lateral architecture and the inhibition mechanism of the small molecule inhibitors on fibril formation .
introduction a number of human diseases known as amyloidoses [ 1 ],[ 2 ] are associated with the presence of amyloid plaques in organs and tissues .
the main constituents of these plaques are fibrillar aggregates arising from the pathological self - assembly of normally soluble proteins .
the etiology of amyloidoses is poorly understood , and the causative agents in cellular toxicity have been associated with soluble oligomers [ 3 ] - [ 6 ] as small as dimers [ 6 ] , protofibrils [ 7 ] - [ 10 ] and mature fibrils [ 11 ] .
the fibrillar products of aggregation ( these include protofibrils as well as mature fibrils ) share common structural features : they are enriched in beta - sheet structure and possess a common cross - beta sheet motif , in which the beta - strands lay perpendicular to the main axis of the fibril [ 12 ] - [ 16 ] .
in most cases , the atomic structure of the fibrils is not known , although recent computational and solid - state nmr studies have begun to provide detailed models of amyloid fibrils .
[ 11 ] , [ 17 ] - [ 26 ] perhaps the most clinically relevant amyloidosis is alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) , the leading cause of late - life dementia .
the protein implicated in ad is the 40 - 42 amino - acid long amyloid - beta ( abeta ) peptide , derived from proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein. [ 27 ] - [ 29 ] experimental studies have shown that the morphology of abeta fibrils is exquisitely sensitive to environmental conditions .
gentle mechanic shaking [ 11 ] , small chemical modifications ( e.g the oxidation of met 35 / m35ox [ 19 ]) or ligand binding ( e.g small peptidic [ 30 ] or non - peptidic inhibitors [ 31 ]) can affect the interactions ( salt bridges , hydrophobic side - chain packing etc. ) between the cross - beta subunits ( protofilaments ) constituting the fibril .
this can lead to large scale changes in fibril morphology , and even to altered toxicity [ 11 ] .
for instance , at ph 7.4 and 24degreesc , and under conditions of gentle mechanic sonication , abeta40 peptides are seen to form amyloid fibrils (" agitated fibrils ") that predominantly contain 2 cross - beta subunits with untwisted , " striated ribbon " morphologies .
[ 32 ] based on a combination of data from solid state nmr and scanning transmission electron microscopy ( stem ) , tycko and co - workers showed that the agitated amyloid fibrils are 2 - fold - symmetric ( i.e have 2 equivalent cross - beta - subunits ) .
in sharp contrast , under the same solution conditions , but in the absence of sonication , the resulting " quiescently " grown abeta40 fibrils predominantly contain 3 cross - beta subunits with a " twisted pair " morphology .
[ 33 ],[ 34 ] these quiescent fibrils appear to be more toxic than the agitated fibrils , based on studies on rat embryonic hippocampal neurons. [ 11 ] even more striking is the fact that a slight alteration in the quiescent growth conditions leads to a different symmetry for the fibril : in one case , the 3 cross - beta subunits are arranged in an asymmetric manner ( 2 equivalent cross - beta - subunits and one 1 nonequivalent cross - beta - subunit ) [ 11 ] , and in the other , in a symmetric manner ( 3 equivalent cross - beta - subunits ) .
[ 18 ] recently , tycko and co - workers [ 35 ] have performed solid state nmr and mass - per - length ( mpl ) studies on fibrils obtained from ad patients' brain extracts .
these brain - seeded fibrils , which presumably reflect the relevant fibrils structures found in diseased brains , show yet another morphology , albeit one bearing strong similarities to an asymmetric quiescently grown synthetic abeta fibril .
both predominantly contain 3 cross - beta subunits that show two sets of chemical shifts for many 13c - labeled sites , and the primary difference between the synthetic quiescent and brain - derived fibrils appears to lie in the orientation of the side chains in the c - terminal beta - strand of the fibril .
while experimental and computational models of the agitated fibril with 2 - fold symmetry [ 17 ],[ 20 ],[ 22 ],[ 32 ] and of the quiescent fibril with 3 - fold symmetry [ 18 ] have been proposed based on experimental and computational studies , there is presently no atomically detailed model of the asymmetric quiescent synthetic fibril or of the brained - seeded fibril .
based on the structure of the solved fibrils of abeta and analysis of the experimental data for the unsolved fibrils , it emerges that all abeta fibrils ( agitated or quiescent ) studied by tycko and co - workers share the same fundamental building block : a common cross - beta subunit .
this subunit ( shown in fig. 1 a - b ) consists of stacked beta - sheets formed from the parallel in - registry assembly of a u - shaped beta - strand - loop - beta - strand motif .
in this cross - beta subunit , the beta - strands are oriented perpendicular to main chain hydrogen bonding direction , with the hydrogen bonding direction laying parallel to the fibril axis .
two such cross - beta subunits stack laterally ( the normal direction to the beta - sheet surface ) to form the 2 - fold symmetric agitated fibril [ 32 ] , while three such units arrange in a triangle to form the 3 - fold symmetric quiescent structure. [ 18 ] the atomic details of the cross - beta subunits differ slightly in the agitated and quiescent models .
in the quiescent asymmetric case , a slight conformational difference has been reported in the side - chains of the solvent exposed loop region ( residues 23 - 29 ) , but the beta - sheet - to - beta - sheet stacking that determines the overall morphology of the fibril is the same .
in the case of the brain - derived subunits , the side - chain orientations of some of the residues are inverted with respect to those in the agitated subunit .
in this study , we use the cross - beta subunit of reference [ 32 ] ( the structure based on the most recent refinement work by tycko and co - workers , and one that is consistent with the original predictions of nussinov and coworkers , ref [ 36 ]) as a starting point for our simulations .
using stacking simulations between cross - beta subunits , we propose a structural model for the asymmetric quiescent abeta fibrils and for the brain - seeded fibrils .
in the case of the brain - seeded fibril , we introduce appropriate modifications ( as detailed in the methods section ) to capture the correct orientation of the side chains .
our simulations are akin to quiescent assembly conditions as we are not including the effects of mechanical agitation in our stacking simulations .
we validate our resulting models using the experimental data provided in the work of tycko and co - workers .
[ 11 ],[ 35 ],[ 37 ],[ 38 ] we also propose a unifying lateral stacking mechanism that explains the variations in fibril 's lateral architecture and toxicity under different external perturbations ( mechanical shaking , m35 oxidation , and ligand binding ) .

g - i : cartoons of 3 parallel constructs with 3 types of interfaces .
results stability of the single cross - beta subunit a starting cross - beta subunit is extracted from the 2 - fold symmetric model of the agitated abeta9 - 40 fibrils .
this structure corresponds to the most recent refined structure obtained by tycko and workers [ 17 ],[ 32 ] it consists of two beta - sheet layers , with each layer containing 6 abeta9 - 40 peptides , in which each abeta9 - 40 peptide ( fig. 1a ) is arranged in a beta - strand - loop - beta - strand / u fold : a n - terminal beta - strand ( residues 10 - 22 ) , a loop ( residues 23 - 29 ) and a c - terminal beta - strand ( residues 30 - 40 ) .
we use the following nomenclature : since the exposed side of the c - terminal beta - strand contains only hydrophobic residues ( g29 _ i31 _ g33 _ m35 _ g37 _ v39 ) , we refer to it as the hydrophobic " h " beta - strand .
in contrast , since the exposed side of the n - terminal beta - strand contains hydrophobic residues separated by charged or polar residues ( y10 _ v12 _ h14 _ k16 _ v18 _ f20 _ e22 _ v24 ) , we refer to it as the polar " p " beta - strand .
this nomenclature enables us to distinguish the n - and c - terminal beta - strand .
the implication of a uniform hydrophobic ( h ) surface as opposed to one interdispersed with polar residues ( p ) will be discussed later in the text .
we used the same cross - beta subunit in modeling fibrils containing multiple cross - beta subunits .
it should be noted that other researchers have reported differences in the exact position of the residues in the beta - sheets with the length of the beta - strands sometimes changing [ 39 ] .
we also note that we have treated residues 1 - 8 of the abeta peptide in the fibril as disordered , based on experimental data from the studies of tycko and coworkers .
for this reason , we are only modeling residues 9 - 40 of abeta in our stacking simulations .
it is entirely possible that in some polymorphs these residues become structured .
throughout this paper , we denote the cross - beta subunit ( fig. 1b ) as hup where u represents the parallel in - registry assembly of a beta - strand - loop - beta - strand motif , h the hydrophobic ( residues 29 - 39 ) and p the polar ( residues 10 - 22 ) beta - sheet surfaces ( depending on the arrangement of the cross - beta - subunit as part of a larger assembly , the cross - beta - subunit will appear as hup , puh , hintersectionp or pintersectionh ) .
we first considered the stability of this cross - beta - subunit via four 20.0 ns long simulations at 310k .
the subunit was found to be stable , as judged from the small ( less than 2 a ) root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) from the starting structure .
the fact that this subunit is stable is consistent with recent mass - per - length ( mpl ) data from the tycko group in which a peak (~ 9 kd / nm ) corresponding to a single layer of abeta1 - 40 is seen for the agitated and the symmetric quiescent fibril of abeta [ 38 ] ( 1 subunit is ~ 9 kd / nm , hence the number of subunit is equal to mpl / 9 ) .
similar studies using the new apparatus reported in reference 35 have not yet been performed on the asymmetric abeta fibrils .
the core of the 6 - member cross - beta - subunit ( consisting of the 4 inner peptides ) was very stable , while the 2 outer peptides showed more fluctuations .
this is to be expected as the outer peptides have only one neighboring peptide that can provide stabilizing interactions .
since the aim of this study is to investigate lateral assembly and not on beta - sheet extension of the cross - beta - subunit [ 40 ] , we only consider the outer peptides in the energetic , but not the structural analysis .
formation of a fibril containing two cross - beta - subunits having established that the cross - beta - subunit is a stable entity , we used it as a building block to construct a profibril containing two such cross - beta - subunits .
several possible arrangements are possible , and we considered all 6 possibilities based on a combination of 3 interfaces and 2 orientations between two cross - beta - subunits ( puh and hintersectionp ) , as listed in text s1 .
the 3 possible interfaces are hh ( hydrophobic - hydrophobic ) , pp ( polar - polar ) and mixed ph ( hydrophobic - polar ) and the 2 possible stacking orientations are parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( a ) .
rather than starting with a pre - assembled fibril and testing its stability [ 21 ] - [ 24 ] , we initiated our simulations with two separated cross - beta - subunits and monitored their assembly ( e.g. fig. 1b ) .
this enables us to study both assembly and stability .
the number of side - chain atom contacts and 6 additional structural order parameters were used to characterize the beta - sheet - to - beta - sheet stacking process ( see text s1 ). of the 6 possible constructs , an ordered and stable fibril interface was observed only in constructs app , ahh , and phh .
snapshots of the final structure from a representative trajectory for each of the 6 constructs studied shown in figure 2 .
we summarize the structural features of the three ordered interfaces below , with the other three disordered interfaces described in the supplemental material .
for app ( fig. 2 - a1 ) , the interface is stabilized by two hydrophobic pairs ( f20 - v18 and v18 - f20 , viewed from left to right ) , and two salt bridges ( e22 - k16 and k16 - e22 , viewed from left to right ) in the cross section ( along the beta - sheet stacking direction ) of the ordered four beta - sheet layers .
the side - chains at the sheet - to - sheet interface are packed head - to - head without interdigitating (" zipping ") leading to a large layer - to - layer distance ( 13.6 +/ - 0.4 a ) .
in the case of ahh ( fig. 2 - c3 ) , a tight hydrophobic interface is formed by five hydrophobic pairs ( g29 - v39 , i31 - g37 , g33 - m35 , m35 - g32 and g37 - i31 , viewed from left to right ) between two n - terminal beta - strands ( i.e. g29 _ i31 _ g33 _ m35 _ g37 _ v39 ) .
the lack of side - chains of the glycine residues provides a groove on one face into which the large hydrophobic side chains of the opposite cross - beta unit can fit .
as a result of the insertion of the large hydrophobic side chains ( v39 , m35 and i31 ) into the grooves formed by g29 and g33 on the opposite face , the resulting layer - to - layer distance ( 7.1 +/ - 0.8 a ) in ahh is shorter than seen in app ( 13.6 +/ - 0.4 a )." in additions , the beta - sheets at the interface of system ahh are slightly less twisted than those of system app ( twist angle of ~ 3degrees in ahh versus app ~ 6degrees for app ) .
for phh , a tight hydrophobic interface is formed by four hydrophobic pairs ( g29 - i31 , i31 - g33 , g33 - m35 and m35 - g37 , viewed from left to right ) as a result of a one - residue shift of the beta - strand along the beta - strand direction .

the oxygen of the oxidized met 35 is shown in red vdw ball .
in order to gain further insight into the relative stability of the fibrils with different interfaces , we calculated the binding energy between two cross - beta subunits over time for each system using the mm - gbsa module in amber .
the convergence was observed in the last 5 ns ( see ahh system as an example in text s1 ) .
the results over the last 5 ns are shown in figure 3 .
a clear relative trend emerges : the ordered complexes app and ahh have the lowest binding energies ( - 159.9 +/ - 7.4 and - 156.2 +/ - 9.5 kcal / mol respectively ) .
the phh construct has a less favorable binding energy ( - 108.4 +/ - 6.8 kcal / mol ) than ahh .
the significant difference (~ 48 kcal / mol or ~ 4 kcal / mol per peptide ) in binding energies between ahh and phh illustrates that stability is not only determined by the hydrophobicity of the interface alone ; the interdigitation of the side - chains at the interface also plays a key role [ 41 ] .
it is interesting to note that 2d 13c - 13c nmr experiments [ 32 ] have identified the presence of contact pairs i31 - g37 and m35 - g33 in abeta40 fibrils , which further support a construct with an ahh interface over a phh one [ 21 ],[ 32 ] in 2 - cross - beta - subunit fibrils .
indeed , these contact pairs are among the contact pairs ( g29 - v39 , i31 - g37 , g33 - m35 , m35 - g32 and g37 - i31 ) present in our ahh model fibril , but not in the phh fibril .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1000693.g003 figure 3 binding energies between the two cross - beta subunits with different interfaces .
the binding energy was calculated over the last 5 ns simulations using the mm - gbsa implicit solvation model in the amber program. from an energetic perspective , app and ahh are the most favorable interfaces ( indistinguishable within error from each other based on our binding energy calculations ) .
however , from an entropic perspective , one could argue that the ahh interface might be slightly more favorable than the app interface ( larger deltas ) .
the energetic basin associated with hydrophobic interactions ( ie , the hh interface ) is much broader than the narrow basin associated with distance dependent electrostatic interactions ( the salt bridges at the pp interface ) .
as a result , the hh interface can accommodate much more structural fluctuations and disorder than the pp interface .
fluctuations leading to a shifting of the two cross - beta - subunits along the beta - strand direction or disorder related to mis - registry can be tolerated at the hh interface , but not at the pp interface where such effects would lead to breaking of the salt - bridges and hence an overall destabilization of the fibril .
as a result , the ahh interface would be the most favorable in terms of free energy , with app the close second .
our results are in a qualitative agreement with a recent stability studies [ 22 ] - [ 24 ] of pre - constructed 2 - cross - beta - subunit species of abeta40 modeled by another popular charmm force field [ 42 ] .
assembly of an asymmetric quiescent fibril containing 3 - 4 cross - beta - subunits from 1 - cross - beta - subunit and 2 - cross - beta - subunit species having established that the 1 - cross - beta - subunit and the 2 - cross - beta - subunit constructs with ahh and app interfaces are stable , we now turn to the assembly of a larger profibril based on the 1 - and 2 - cross - beta - subunits .
in particular , we wish to construct a model for the asymmetric 3 - subunit quiescent fibril seen in the experiments of tycko and co - workers [ 11 ] .
the asymmetry is suggested by the fact that two sets of chemical shifts were observed in experiment for several 13c - labeled sites , indicating that the sidechains of these residues are in different environments , in order to satisfy this asymmetry , two different types of interfaces between three cross - beta - subunits are required .
based on our previous calculations , we expect one of the interfaces to be ahh ( the most stable interface ) , and the other one to be app ( the second most stable interface ) .
the experiments of tycko also indicate the presence of a smaller amount of a 4 cross - beta - subunit fibril .
similarly to the 3 cross - beta - subunit fibril , this structure will also involve the two types of interfaces .
a 3 - cross - beta - subunit protofibril can arise either from a 3 body assembly ( 1 + 1 + 1 ) , or from a 2 body assembly ( 2 + 1 ) .
here we only model the 2 + 1 assembly pathway , as a two - body assembly is more probable than a three - body assembly for entropic reasons .
the ( 2 + 1 ) stacking would involve in a first step the formation of a 2 - subunit fibril ( puhhintersectionp ) with an ahh interface ( such as the model proposed for the agitated 2 - cross - beta - subunit fibril ) .
it would be followed by the lateral stacking of another cross - beta - subunit such that the final fibril has 3 stacked cross - beta - subunits ( puhhintersectionppuh ) with two interfaces ahh and app ( fig. 4 left ) .
similarly , to obtain a 4 - subunit profibril , " 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 " , " 2 + 1 + 1 " , " 2 + 2 " ( puhhintersectionp + puhhintersectionp ) and " 3 + 1 " ( puhhintersectionppuh + hintersectionp ) stackings are possible .
we focus our study on the app interface formation in the ( 2 + 2 ) pathway .
the resulting fibril would be arranged as puhhintersectionppuhhintersectionp with three interfaces ahh , app and ahh ( fig. 4 right ) .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1000693.g004 figure 4 quiescent fibril structure models of purely synthetic fibrils obtained from our stacking simulations .
a : our proposed structural model of the 3 - fold asymmetric quiescent abeta40 fibrils with 3 cross - beta subunits , obtained from the " 2 + 1 " stacking simulations ( see all trajectories in text s1 ) .
b : our proposed structural model of quiescent abeta40 fibrils with 4 cross - beta subunits , obtained from the " 2 + 2 " stacking simulations ( see all trajectories in text s1 ) .
c - d : cartoons of a and b. we investigated the assembly of the 2 + 1 ( puhhintersectionp + puh ) construct for the 3 - subunit profibril and the 2 + 2 ( puhhintersectionp + puhhintersectionp ) construct for the 4 - subunit profibril .
the simulations were initiated with the components ( puhhintersectionp and puh for the 3 - subunit fibril and puhhintersectionp + puhhintersectionp for the 4 - subunit fibril ) separated by 10 a (~ 3 water layers ) along the beta - sheet stacking direction .
four 20 ns simulations were performed for the 2 + 1 and 2 + 2 systems at 310 k and the formation of the app interface was monitored .
an ordered and stable app interface was formed in all eight simulations ( text s1 ) .
a representative structure of the resulting 3 and 4 cross - beta - subunit quiescent fibrils is shown in figure 4 .
the binding energy for forming the app interface in the " 2 + 1 " or the " 2 + 2 " constructs was - 163.4 +/ - 9.9 kcal / mol , comparable to the number ( - 159.9 +/ - 7.4 kcal / mol ) seen for forming the in " 1 + 1 " app interface .
the structural parameters are also comparable ( data not shown ) .
our proposed 3 - cross - beta - subunit asymmetric fibril ( puhhintersectionppuh ) structure has the following features : 1 ) the surface side chains of each of the 3 cross - beta - subunits are not structural equivalent due to different environment ( e.g either exposed to solvent or buried at the ahh or app interface ) ; 2 ) the two exposed beta - sheet surfaces of the fibril differ in hydrophobicity : one is polar / charged ( exposed residues h14 , k16 and e22 ) ; the other is quite hydrophobic ( exposed residues i31 , m35 and v39 ) ; 3 ) whereas the k16 and e22 residues at the app interface forms salt - bridges , the k16 and e22 residues at the surface are exposed to solvent and do not form salt bridges .
4 ) the 3 cross - beta - subunits are tightly stacked and the thickness of fibril is ~ 60 a. our proposed 4 - cross - beta - subunit fibril ( puhhintersectionppuhhintersectionp ) has two - fold symmetry and the two exposed surfaces are polar / charged .
in addition , only half of the k16 and e22 residues from all 4 cross - beta - subunits formed salt - bridges ( those at the app interface ) .
we note that tycko and co - workers report a slight conformation difference in the side - chains of the loop region ( residues 23 - 29 ) in the core cross - beta - subunit between the agitated and quiescent structures .
the use of the agitated cross - beta - subunit as our initial building block should not affect our resulting structural model .
indeed , the loop is exposed to the solvent and plays little role in the beta - sheet - to - beta - sheet stacking that determines the overall morphology of the fibril .
it is important to note that the loop region is highly flexible ( dynamic ) compared to the beta - sheet regions .
it is quite possible that if we ran the simulation longer , we would see some changes in the loop structure of the non - equivalent cross - beta - subunit that experiences a different environment from the one seen in the symmetric agitated fibril .
stability of brain - seeded fibril containing 3 cross - beta - subunits recent experiments by tycko and co - workers [ 35 ] on brain - seeded abeta fibrils indicate that these fibrils bear strong morphological resemblance to the quiescently grown asymmetric synthetic fibrils .
both chemical shifts and dipole - dipole couplings [ 35 ] show the peptide in brain - seeded fibrils adopts the same beta - strand - loop - beta - strand conformation as in the asymmetric quiescent fibrils ( e.g. f19 , a30 , i31 , l34 and m35 in beta - strands ; d23 , v24 and g25 in non - beta - strand conformation ; presence of a d23 - k28 salt bridge ) .
mpl data indicate that the brain - seeded structures ( again like the quiescent structures ) consist primarily of fibrils with 3 cross - beta subunits and nmr experiments show two sets of chemical shifts for many 13c - labeled sites .
the primary difference between the brain - seeded and asymmetric quiescent fibrils lies in the orientation of the side - chains .
2d radiofrequency - assisted diffusion ( rad ) spectra [ 35 ] indicate an additional f19 - i31 side chain - side chain contact , suggesting the side chains in the c - terminal beta - strand are " up - down " flipped as compared with the asymmetric quiescent fibrils .
this flipping could be enabled by the flexible backbone of g29 residue , which could accommodate either orientation of side - chains in the c - terminal beta - strand .
using the 3 - fold asymmetric quiescent fibril model as a template , we construct a model for the brain - seeded fibril by flipping the side chains at the c - terminal beta - strand ( fig. 5 ) .
the 3 cross - beta - subunit model has both ahh and app interfaces .
while the interactions at the app interface are the same as in the asymmetric quiescent fibrils , the detailed interactions at the ahh interface is changed as the sidechains are flipped ( i.e the side chains of i32 , i34 and v36 now interdigitate ) .
the stability of our brain - seeded fibril model was confirmed by four 20.0 ns md simulations at 310k in which the brain - seeded fibril was found to be stable , as judged from the small ( less than 2 a ) root mean square distance ( rmsd ) from the starting structure .
the binding energies for forming the ahh and app interfaces are respectively - 155.4 +/ - 5.9 and - 160.4 +/ - 7.9 kcal / mol , which are comparable to those in the synthetic fibrils with 3 - cross - beta - subunits .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1000693.g005 figure 5 quiescent fibril structure model of brain - seeded fibrils .
a : an initial structure b - c : a representative last snapshot in ribbon and in cartoon .
the fibrils contain three cross - beta subunits from four 20 - ns stability simulations ( see all trajectories in text s1 ) .
destabilizing effect of m35ox on the hydrophobic interface ( hh ) of synthetic fibrils much like mechanical agitation , the chemical oxidation of m35 can dramatically alter fibril lateral formation .
in the case of the abeta42 peptide , the beta - sheet - to - beta - sheet stacking process is completely blocked such that the resulting abeta42 ( m35ox ) fibril contains only a single cross - beta - subunit [ 19 ] .
since both the abeta40 and the abeta42 cross - beta - subunits contain similar beta - strand - loop - beta - strand motifs ( they differ in the precise location of the loop ) , one would expect the m35 oxidation to affect abeta40 fibrils in a similar manner as abeta42 .
the structure of the m35ox variant of abeta9 - 40 has not been solved experimentally .
here , we consider a m35ox variant of abeta9 - 40 and investigate the effects of the oxidation , first on the single cross - beta - subunit , then on the assembly ( monitored by stacking simulations ) of the ahh and phh constructs .
we find that the stability of the 1 - cross - beta - subunit in our simulations is not affected by the single oxidation of m35 , likely a result of the fact that the side chains of the met residues are exposed to the solvent and hence do not contribute to the stability of the cross - beta - subunit .
in contrast , the " 1 + 1 " assembly simulations ( with the m35 oxidation ) show a reduction in the number of trajectories that lead to an ordered assembled complex ( from 4 to 2 for ahh and from 3 to 1 for phh out of a total four trajectories for each construct ) ( see text s1 ) .
this confirms that hydrophobic interactions play an important role in stabilizing the phh and ahh interfaces .
introduction of a polar side - chain at the interface level ( here via single oxidation of the hydrophobic m35 residue ) significantly affects the formation of the hydrophobic interfaces .
the stronger hydration tendency of the m35ox residues in the ahh ( m35ox ) and phh ( m35ox ) constructs in comparison to the m35 residues in constucts ahh and phh is directly supported by the presence of more water molecules in the first solvation shell (< 2.8 a ) of these side chains , averaged over the last ns of the simulations ( table 2 ) .
~ 22 and ~ 28 waters are present in systems ahh ( m35ox ) and phh ( m35ox ) , respectively , while only ~ 10 and ~ 12 waters are present for systems ahh and phh , respectively .
binding energy calculations also reveal a weaker binding energy ( less favorable binding ) between the two cross - beta - subunits in constructs ahh ( m35ox ) and phh ( m35ox ) than that in constructs ahh and phh by ~ 41.4 and ~ 22.6 kcal / mol , respectively ( see fig. 3 ) .
again , our finding is in a qualitative agreement with a recent stability study [ 22 ] of pre - constructed 2 - cross - beta - subunit species of abeta40 m35ox mutants modeled using the charmm force field [ 42 ] .
we predict that abeta40 m35ox mutants would predominantly exist in a single layer structure .
it would be interested to see mpl data on this system to confirm this prediction .
discussion amyloid fibrils are often generated via mechanical agitation in the laboratory , as this process speeds up fibril formation .
fibril formation in the brain , however , more likely resembles quiescent conditions .
indeed , mpl measurements performed by tycko and co - workers [ 35 ] have recently shown that fibrils seeded from alzheimer 's brain - derived fibrils ( likely reflecting the relevant structures present in ad brains ) adopt a structure that has higher similarity to quiescent synthetic fibril structures [ 11 ] ( a 3 cross - beta subunit structure ) than to agitated fibrils ( a 2 cross - beta subunit structure ) .
furthermore , the brain - seeded fibrils show much greater morphological similarities to the asymmetric quiescent fibril structure than to the symmetric quiescent polymorph , presumably because more perturbations were involved in the seeding and growth procedure that generated the fibrils with symmetric structure .
[ 18 ] structures have been proposed for both the 2 - fold agitated fibrils [ 20 ],[ 23 ],[ 32 ] and for the 3 - fold symmetric , quiescently grown fibrils [ 18 ] .
in both cases , the fundamental building block is the same cross - beta subunit consisting of stacked beta - strand - loop - beta - strand motifs ( see figure 1 ) .
in the agitated fibril , two such cross - beta - subunits are stacked laterally .
in the symmetric quiescent structure , 3 cross - beta - subunits are arranged in a triangular configuration .
the atomistic structure of the asymmetric 3 - unit quiescent fibril and the brain - seeded fibril , on the other hand are not known .
in the present work , we propose the first atomistic structure for the asymmetric 3 - subunit quiescent synthetic fibril using molecular dynamics that probe the assembly of the core cross - beta subunits .
this structure is then used as a template for a brain - seeded model that differs primarily from the synthetic quiescently grown fibrils in the orientation of the side chains at the c - terminal beta - strand .
our simulations suggest that the asymmetric quiescent fibrils contain 3 cross - beta subunits arranged in 6 tightly stacked beta - sheet layers ( puhhintersectionppuh ) with two interfaces ahh and app ( fig. 4 left ) .
our proposed structural model is consistent with the known constraints experimentally identified by tycko and coworkers [ 11 ],[ 32 ],[ 43 ] .
the experimental observations are the following : ( a ) the quiescent fibrils share similar cross - beta subunit with the agitated fibril ; ( b ) the quiescent fibrils predominantly contains 3 cross - beta - subunits rather than the 2 cross - beta - subunits seen in the agitated fibrils ( this information is obtained from analysis of the mass per length ( mpl ) values from stem experiments ) ; ( c ) the quiescent fibril contains two structurally equivalent and one structurally non - equivalent parts .
this conclusion is drawn from the fact that many residues exhibit two sets of 13c chemical shifts , with an approximate 2:1 ratio of nmr signal intensities .
in particular , splitting of i31 was observed even after three generations of the quiescent fibrils ( fig. 2 of ref. 10 ) .
( d ) partial occupation of an intermolecular k16 - e22 salt bridge .
tycko and co - workers report the presence of dipole - dipole couplings between side - chain csigma carbons of e22 residues and side - chain nzeta nitrogens of k16 residues in quiescent fibrils , but not in agitated fibrils [ 11 ] .
our proposed structure clearly satisfies constraints a and b. constraint c is satisfied as well : our model ( see fig. 4 left ) contains two structurally equivalent and one structurally non - equivalent parts ( puhhintersectionppuh ) : 2 equivalent layers at the interfaces ( ahh and app ) and one non - equivalent outer sheet - layer exposed to solvent ( p and h ) .
hence , the side chains on the peptide surface ( residues h14 , k16 , v18 , f20 , e22 , and v24 of the polar beta - strand / p and i31 , m35 and v39 of the hydrophobic beta - strand / h ) would experience two chemical environments with a ratio of 2:1 , consistent with the experimentally observed chemical shift splitting with a ratio of 2:1 .
as a specific example , we turn to residue i31 for which two sets of 13c chemical shifts , with an approximate 2:1 ratio of nmr signal intensities , are observed experimentally .
the implication is that this residue is found in two difference chemical environments .
this is consistent with our three - layer asymmetric structure .
one environment corresponds to the i31 residues being buried at the interface ; the second corresponds to the i31 residues being exposed to the solvent .
there are two instance where the i31 is buried , and one where it is exposed , corresponding to the experimentally observed 2:1 splitting ratio .
in terms of constraint d , our construct indeed shows partial occupancy of the k16 - e22 salt bridge .
k16 - e22 salt bridges are formed at the app interface between the upper two sheet - layers ( puhhintersectionppuh ) .
the k16 and e22 salt bridges on the outer polar surface are still exposed to water , leading to a 2 / 3 occupancy of the k16 - e22 salt bridges ( see fig. 4 left ) .
it is important to note that the observation of multiple sets of nmr signals for a single labeled site in the fibril ( as seen in the experiments of tycko cite ) does not rule out the presence of a co - existing population of symmetric structures along with asymmetric structures .
indeed , an alternate explanation for multiple sets of nmr signals is that the sample in reality contains a mixture of fibrils ( e.g different symmetric and asymmetric morphologies ) .
however , one can argue in the case of the quiescently grown fibrils of reference [ 11 ],[ 37 ] that the presence of both a k16 - e22 salt bridge coupled to the presence of a 3 cross - beta unit structure sufficiently implies that even in a polymorphic sample , the asymmetric structure would be the major species .
the brain - seeded fibrils have not been characterized to the extent of the quiescent fibrils and many more nmr contacts remain to be established .
further experimental data for the brain - seeded fibrils ( for instance , a clear signature of a k16 - e22 salt bridge at the app interface and further contacts at the ahh interface ) are required to fully validate our brain - seeded model .
at present , the experimental data does not seem consistent with a symmetric 3 cross - beta unit fibril as a major species , although such polymorphs may be present in the brain .
it is important to note that the final morphology of a fibril is dictated by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors .
the data of the 2005 tycko paper [ 11 ] ( reporting the asymmetric structure ) and 2008 paper ( reporting the symmetric structure ) [ 18 ] pertain to fibrils grown under different conditions .
it is apparent that the symmetric " triangle " structure cannot be energetically more stable that the asymmetric 3 - layer structure , given the fact that there are far fewer hydrophobic contacts between the subunits .
entropically , the formation of the symmetric structure ( if one considers that it forms from pre - formed subunits , which may not be the case ) , would have to occur in a concerted 3 - body 1 + 1 + 1 manner .
an " open " 1 + 1 complex on its own would likely not be stable ( or at least not as stable as a closed stacked form ) .
thermodynamically , the stacked asymmetric structure is certainly going to be favored , with the symmetric structure likely a result of kinetic trapping during the experimental procedure .
it is compelling to note that the brain derived structure , one that has formed slowly in the brain , perhaps even over decades ( ie that had more opportunity to find a thermodynamically stable structure ) , does not appear to be consistent with the triangle structure , but rather with a layered structure .
our stacking simulations enable us to propose a lateral growth mechanism for the formation of a multiple layer protofibril (< 24 peptides ) .
this protofibril acts as a seed for the growth of mature fibrils by the addition of peptides to the two edges ( via the nucleation - growth mechanism [ 1 ]) .
this mechanism is shown in figure 6 .
in the first step , a 2 - cross - beta - subunit protofibril is assembled from two 1 - cross - beta - subunit protofibrils [ 38 ] by forming an ahh interface , which is stabilized by hydrophobic and van der waals ( vdw ) interactions via interdigitation of the facing side chains .
in the second step , the 2 - cross - beta - subunit protofibril with an ahh interface further assembles with another 1 - cross - beta - subunit into a 3 - cross - beta - subunit protofibril .
the new interface app is stabilized by salt bridges , hydrophobic and vdw interactions .
growth to a 4 - cross - beta - subunit protofibril is possible , following one of two 2 - body assembling pathways : formation of an app interface between two 2 - cross - beta - subunit protofibril ( 2 + 2 ) or formation of an ahh interface by adding a cross - beta - subunit on top of 3 - cross - beta - subunit protofibril ( 3 + 1 ) .
further lateral growth into larger ( 5 or greater ) cross - beta - subunit complexes is likely limited by the twisting of the beta - sheet - layer and other structural defects in the cross - beta - subunit which prohibits subunit - to - subunit stacking .
in other words , the lateral growth is limited by a faster increase of the entropic cost ( i.e. fast decrease of translation , rotation and conformation entropy upon stacking ) than the increase of the favorable interactions .
in fact , a maximum of 4 peptide layers / cross - beta - subunits in the fibril is seen experimentally , as opposed to the ~ 103 peptide repetition along the fibril axis for a ~ microm length fibril .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1000693.g006 figure 6 lateral growth mechanism in the formation of a multiple layer protofibril .
this lateral growth mechanism explains the effects of external perturbation on synthetic fibril formation .
for example , mechanical shaking of the solution kinetically blocks the formation of the app interface ( which is less stable than ahh interface ) probably induced by the air water surface .
it would hinder the formation of a 3 or 4 cross - beta - subunit leaving the 2 - cross - beta - subunit protofibril ( with ahh interface ) for growing mature 2 - cross - beta - subunit fibril as the major product .
this is consistent with the experimental observation that under conditions of mechanical agitation , the predominant product is a 2 - cross - beta - subunit fibril .
another example is a chemical perturbation via oxidation that affects the structure of the abeta fibrils .
our simulations suggest that , much as is the case for the abeta42 ( m35ox ) fibrils [ 19 ] , the abeta40 ( m35ox ) fibrils would exist predominantly in a single cross - beta - subunit form .
the oxidation significantly destabilizes the ahh interface ( we see disordered stacking trajectories and a weaker binding energy in system ahh ( m35ox ) and phh ( m35ox ) .
this prevents the formation of multiple (> 2 ) cross - beta subunit fibrils , hence leading to predominance of a 1 - cross - beta - subunit fibril .
it is tempting to speculate about why asymmetric quiescent fibrils are more toxic than agitated fibrils .
although the precise mechanism of toxicity of fibrils and early aggregates is still a matter of debate , it is likely that the exposure of hydrophobic side chains , normally buried in a folded protein or dispersed in an unfolded ensemble , is a key component in toxicity [ 1 ] .
in the most stable 2 - cross - beta - subunit fibrils ahh ( puhhintersectionp ) ( the most likely candidate for the structure of the agitated fibril ) , the continuous hydrophobic surfaces are buried , with the exterior sheet - layers hydrophilic .
the solvent exposed surface of the 2 - subunit ( puhhintersectionp ) fibril ( e.g y10 _ v12 _ h14 _ k16 _ v18 _ f20 _ e22 _ v24 of the n - terminal beta - strand ) , with small hydrophobic patches interdispersed with non - polar residues , resembles the surface of a folded protein .
in contrast , our proposed asymmetric quiescent abeta40 fibrils with 3 cross - beta - subunits ( puhhintersectionppuh ) has a ( large ) exposed continuous hydrophobic face ( - uh ) to the solvent ( i.e. g29 _ i31 _ g33 _ m35 _ g37 _ v39 of the c - terminal beta - strand ) .
this surface may interfere with the normal function of other proteins possibly by binding to and disabling them .
in the same spirit , the 1 - cross - beta - subunit fibril with the m35ox substitution also has a large exposed hydrophobic surface , which may also be one of the factors responsible for the higher toxicity of the abeta42 ( m35ox ) fibrils [ 44 ] over the wild type fibrils .
if indeed having a the large exposed hydrophobic surface of fibrils leads to higher toxicity , then " detergent - like " ligands may provide an effective therapeutic for amyloidoses : they could be used to cover the hydrophobic surface by binding their hydrophobic part to the hydrophobic surface , thus exposing their hydrophilic part to the solvent .
the exposed hydrophilic part would help improve the solubility of the protofibrils .
in addition , these ambiphilic ligands might also cap the lateral growth of protofibrils by blocking the formation of the ahh interface .
this may explain the mode of action of both a novel class of peptidic inhibitors designed by soto et al .
[ 30 ] and a weaker non - peptidic inhibitor ( congo red ) [ 45 ] , both of which exhibit this ambiphilic feature ( hydrophobic / aromatic side chains on one face ; hydrophilic on the other ) .
methods system preparation a neutral simulation system consists of 1 - 4 cross - beta - subunit ( 6 abeta9 - 40 peptides per cross - beta - subunit ) , 6 - 24 sodium ions and ~ 5,000 - 13,000 water molecules ( see table 1 for details ) .
the duan et al all - atom point - charge force field [ 46 ] ( amber ff03 ) was chosen to represent the peptide .
the parameters for single oxidized met were derived by following the same protocol used in developing amber ff03 .
the solvent was explicitly represented by the tip3p [ 47 ] water model .
an abeta9 - 40 peptide in the cross - beta - subunit has a beta - strand - loop - beta - strand configuration with a " polar " beta - strand spanning residues 10 - 22 , a loop spanning residues 23 - 29 and a hydrophobic beta - strand spanning residues 30 - 40 ( see fig. 1a ) .
the initial structure of the 1 - cross - beta - subunit ( see fig. 1c ) , containing 6 peptides , is a computationally refined structure based on the experimental constraints , which is the latest structure provided by tycko and coworkers [ 32 ],[ 35 ] .
the dimensions of the 1 - cross - beta - subunit are 30x50x16 a3 along , respectively , beta - sheet extension direction ( main - chain hydrogen bond direction ) , beta - strand direction and beta - sheet stacking direction / lateral direction ( perpendicular to the beta - sheet surface ) .
for a 1 - cross - beta - subunit , both wild type methionine ( m35 ) and its singly oxidized form ( m35ox ) were studied .
for 2 - cross - beta - subunit systems , two 1 - cross - beta - subunits were aligned and separated by 10a (~ 3 water layers ) along the beta - sheet stacking direction ( fig. 1b ) , allowing for optimal binding while largely reducing the high computational cost for the diffusion step of the binding process .
a 1 - cross - beta - subunit has a hydrophobic beta - sheet surface ( h ) and a " polar " beta - sheet surface ( p ) .
based on the possible 2 relative orientations ( parallel or anti - parallel ) and 3 types of interfaces ( pp , hh and hp ; h : hydrophobic ; p : polar ) , a total of six systems were constructed , leading to six possible beta - sheet - to - beta - sheet interfaces ( app , ppp , ahh , phh , ahp and php in text s1 ) .
to examine the role of the oxidized m35 on beta - sheet - to - beta - sheet stacking , the singly oxidized m35 ( m35ox ) was considered in the two systems ( ahh and phh ) in which the hydrophobic beta - sheets were facing each other ( text s1 ) .
for the 3 and 4 cross - beta - subunit systems , 2 + 1 and 2 + 2 systems ( with the ahh interface in the 2 - cross - beta - subunit fibril ) were simulated .
6 - 24 positive sodium ions ( na +) were added to neutralize the 6 - 24 negative charges carried by 6 - 24 abeta40 peptides .
for the brain seeded fibril system , a 3 cross - beta - unit was preformed ( fig. 5 right ) .
the solute molecules were immersed in a rectangle box of ~ 5,000 - 13,000 water molecules with dimensions of ~ 50 - 92x82 - 92x44 - 117 a3 .
the periodic water box was constructed in such a way that the solute was at least ~ 10 a away from the box surface and the minimum distance between the solute and the image was ~ 20 a .

md simulation the amber 9 simulation package [ 48 ] was used in both molecular dynamics simulations and data processing .
the system was subjected to periodic boundary conditions .
after an initial energy minimization , a total of 52 simulations ( 4 runs for each of 13 systems ) were performed with different initial random velocities .
the initial velocities were generated according to the maxwell - boltzmann 's distribution at physiological temperature ( 310 k ) .
a short 1.0 ns molecular dynamics at 310 k in the npt ensemble ( constant pressure and temperature ) was performed to adjust system size and density , and to equilibrate the solvent .
the simulations were continued at 310k for 9 / 19 ns in the nvt ensemble ( constant volume and temperature ) .
the particle - mesh ewald method [ 49 ] was used to treat the long - range electrostatic interactions .
shake [ 50 ] was applied to constrain all bonds involving in hydrogen atoms and a time step of 2.0 fs was used .
non - bonded forces were calculated using a two - stage respa approach [ 51 ] where the forces within a 10 a radius were updated every step and those beyond 10 a were updated every two steps .
temperature was controlled at 310k using the berendsen algorithm [ 52 ] with a coupling constant of 2.0 ps. the center of mass translations and rotations were removed every 500 steps .
studies have shown this removes the " block of ice " problem .
[ 53 ],[ 54 ] the trajectories were saved at 2.0 ps intervals for further analysis .
binding energy calculation the binding energy for a complex was evaluated for the snapshots in the last 5 ns of each system using the mm - gbsa ( molecular mechanics - generalized born / surface area ) module [ 55 ] in the amber package .
in mm - gbsa , the solvation free energy is represented by a generalized born term ( the electrostatic part of the solvation ) plus a surface area term ( the apolar part of the solvation free energy ) .
although the mm - gbsa calculations may overestimate the absolute binding energy as a result of missing entropic terms of solute ( such as conformational entropy change of the solute upon binding and etc. ) , they usually provide a reasonable estimate on the relative binding energy when the entropic parts of the two systems are comparable. [ 55 ],[ 56 ] six order parameters for beta - sheet - to - beta - sheet stacking as the 1 - cross - beta - subunit is stable and rigid , we can define a local coordinate system as follows : the origin is set to the center - of - mass ( com ) of the interfacing sheet - layer of the two sheet - layers for 1 - cross - beta - subunit ; the three coordinates are along the beta - sheet extension direction , beta - strand direction and beta - sheet stacking direction ( perpendicular to the beta - sheet surface ) .
hence six parameters ( alpha , beta , gamma , a , b and c ) are used to characterize the structural relationship ( rotation and translation ) between two interfacing beta - sheet - layers of the two 1 - cross - beta - subunits under a rigid body assumption : alpha , beta and gamma are the rotation angles of the beta - sheet extension , beta - strand and beta - sheet stacking directions , respectively and ( a , b and c ) are translation distances along the three directions , respectively .
the beta - strand direction is defined by the direction of the third or fourth beta - strand in the interfacing beta - sheet - layer of the 1 - cross - beta - subunit .
the beta - sheet direction is defined by the same residues ( calpha atoms ) of the second and fifth beta - strands ; and the beta - sheet stacking direction is obtained by the cross - product of the first two directions .

helicobacter pylori colonizes the human stomach and induces inflammation , and in some cases persistent infection can result in gastric cancer .
attachment to the gastric mucosa is the first step in establishing bacterial colonization , and outer membrane proteins ( omps ) play a pivotal role in binding to human cells .
some omp interaction molecules are known in h. pylori , and their associated host cell responses have been gradually clarified .
many studies have demonstrated that omps are essential to caga translocation into gastric cells via the type iv secretion system of h. pylori .
this review summarizes the mechanisms through which h. pylori utilizes omps to colonize the human stomach and how omps cooperate with the type iv secretion system .
helicobacter pylori outer membrane protein pathogenesis type iv secretion system 1 .
introduction membrane proteins are classified by configuration , which determines their function and location .
alpha - helical membrane proteins are found in almost all membranes ; however , beta - barrel membrane proteins are only found in the outer membranes of gram - negative bacteria , and not in gram - positive bacteria .
in bacteria , beta - barrel outer membrane proteins ( omps ) have many functions including importing nutrients and translating signals from the outside environment. with respect to human infection , omps play a pivotal role in colonization , the expression of pathogenic factors , and antibiotic resistance .
for acinetobacter baumannii , omps are essential for establishing infection , and an interaction network with beta - lactamase regulates antibiotic inactivation [ 1,2 ] .
thus , the role of omps in bacteria has been clarified , and new mechanisms to understand the biological roles of omps have been provided .
for helicobacter pylori , many virulence factors have been identified , and their functions have been gradually revealed .
in addition , interaction partners of omps have been identified and their biological functions were elucidated .
recently , the interplay between omps and virulence factors has been suggested .
however , the dynamic functions of omps in h. pylori are still unknown , and investigating these aspects represents an exciting field. h. pylori is a gram - negative bacterium , with which half of the world 's population is infected .
this species is a class i carcinogen that colonizes the human stomach , wherein it can induce inflammatory disorders ( chronic gastritis and ulceration ) and malignant neoplastic diseases ( mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue and gastric cancer ). h. pylori has mechanisms to survive the human stomach , which is a very harsh environment in which it is difficult for bacteria to survive .
as a first line of defense , urease is produced by h. pylori , which results in the generation of ammonia to neutralize the acidic condition .
subsequently , h. pylori attaches to gastric epithelial cells via omps .
the outer membrane of h. pylori plays a pivotal role in the attachment and colonization of gastric cells .
after colonization , h. pylori pathogenesis results in inflammation. h. pylori - infected patients exhibit inflammation of the gastric mucosa , which can result in metaplasia .
finally , some h. pylori - infected patients develop gastric cancer ; however , this typically requires long - term , persistent infection .
among the virulence factors of h. pylori , cytotoxin - associated gene a product ( caga ) , urease , gamma - glutamine transferase , high temperature requirement a , and vacuolation associated gene a ( vaca ) were identified as secreted [ 3 ] .
specifically , caga is injected into human gastric cells via the type iv secretion system ( t4ss ) of h. pylori to induce the production of inflammatory cytokines in gastric epithelial cells [ 4,5,6 ] .
recently , many studies have suggested that the omps of h. pylori play a role not only in the attachment to gastric cells but also in the enhancement of caga translocation via the t4ss .
in 1997 , the genome of h. pylori strain 26695 was sequenced completely , and it was suggested to encode 32 omps [ 7 ] .
subsequent studies revealed that sialic acid - binding adhesin ( saba ) , blood - group - antigen - binding adhesin ( baba ) , adherence - associated lipoprotein a and b ( alpa / b ) , outer inflammatory protein a ( oipa ) , and helicobacter outer membrane protein q ( hopq ) were involved in adhesion ( table 1 ) .
therefore , omps are important for colonization and the establishment of inflammation in the stomach .
the functions of omps are summarized in this review to provide an overview of how h. pylori utilizes membrane proteins to colonize the stomach , a process that results in pathogenesis .
additionally , the evidence suggesting that omps cooperate with the t4ss to translocate caga into gastric cells is summarized .
the biological function of caga protein has been revealed ; however , how omps cooperate with type iv secretion system is unclear .
thus , this review contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamic action between omp and caga translocation via the t4ss .
2. the genetic features of helicobacter omps members of the large helicobacter outer membrane protein ( hop ) family were first characterized as omps in h. pylori .
five proteins ( hopa - e ) were isolated and these were demonstrated to function as porins for transmitting small hydrophobic molecules , nutrients , and some antibiotics by passive diffusion [ 8,9 ] .
the genome of h. pylori 26695 was completely sequenced , and subsequent analysis identified 21 members of the hop family ; these genes encoded proteins that possess one domain of similarity at the n - terminal end and seven domains of similarity at their c - terminal ends [ 7 ] .
a c - terminal phenylalanine residue is essential for the correct assembly of bacterial omps [ 10,11 ] .
however , half of the hop family proteins contain a c - terminal tyrosine .
in addition , all hop proteins possess highly similar c - termini , which contain aromatic residues. with phenylalanine at their c - terminal ends , hop proteins are less divergent in this region , and thus the central hyper - variable domain contains the majority of the membrane - specific sequence .
indeed , for several hop proteins with phenylalanine at the c - terminal end , the similarity of this region between paralogues within a strain is higher than that of orthologous proteins between isolates. h. pylori also contains orthologues of hop - related ( hor ) protein , helicobacter omp family ( hof ) protein , and helicobacter outer membrane ( hom ) family proteins .
the functions of these proteins have not been revealed .
most hop proteins are predicted to fold into anti - parallel amphipathic beta - sheets that organize into a beta - barrel structure .
typically , beta - sheet domains localize to the membrane region , and these domains are connected by short amino acid loops in the periplasmic region , whereas longer amino acid loops connect these domains in the extracellular region .
it is known that the membrane domain is difficult to overexpress and purify .
for h. pylori , the extracellular domain of omp was recently purified and crystallized .
however , the full length omp has not yet been purified for h. pylori .
3. alpa / b alpa and alpb are involved in the adhesion of the pathogen to gastric epithelial cells [ 12 ] .
collagen iv and laminin , which exist in the extracellular matrix , are the suggested binding partners of baba and babb [ 13,14 ] .
both genes have high homology , specifically 46.7 % in h. pylori 26695 , and both proteins are important for adhesion to gastric cells [ 7 ] .
in addition , odenbreit et al. reported that h. pylori expresses alpa and alpb ; however , all other omps ( baba , babb , babc , hopm , saba , and oipa ) were shown to be produced depending on clinical isolate strains [ 15 ] .
this indicates that alpa and alpb are essential and play a main role in colonization .
subsequently , studies demonstrated that alpa - and alpb - mutant h. pylori strains poorly colonize the stomachs of guinea pigs , mice , and mongolian gerbils [ 14,16,17 ] .
thus , it is clear that these factors are important for bacterial colonization .
however , the related role in pathogenesis of alpa and alpb is controversial .
lu et al. suggested that these proteins do not affect caga translocation via the t4ss and that they are involved in the stimulation of certain signaling pathways ( mapks , c - fos , c - jun , creb , ap - 1 , and nf - kappab pathway ) , which can induce production of interleukin - 8 ( il - 8 ) .
furthermore , these factors are associated with a reduction in chemokine kc and interleukin - 6 in the gastric mucosa [ 18 ] .
in contrast , alpa - and alpb - mutant h. pylori caused a more severe inflammatory reaction in mongolian gerbils than the wild type [ 16 ] .
the reason for the contradictory results might be due to differences in host animal species or h. pylori strains .
4. saba h. pylori adhesion via saba is important for colonization and the induction of inflammation in the gastric mucosa .
sialyl lewisx / a glycosphingolipid ( slex and slea ) was identified as a receptor for a 70 kda protein in h. pylori , and this was named saba [ 18,19,20 ] .
recent reports revealed the three - dimensional structure of the extracellular domain of saba and identified the domain responsible for binding to slex and lewisx antigen [ 21 ] .
the functional status of saba is regulated by slipped strand mispairing , which is determined by the number of ct dinucleotide repeats in the 5 ' region of the gene .
switch " on " means that saba is functional , whereas switch " off " means that it is non - functional [ 7,22,23 ] .
the adhesion process via saba is dynamic and co - operates with the t4ss and tnf .
in fact , slex antigen is absent in healthy gastric mucosa , and it was previously unclear how h. pylori uses slex antigen for adhesion .
the t4ss and tnf is suggested to induce slex expression .
marcos et al. demonstrated that cag pai - positive h. pylori induces beta3 glcnact5 ( beta3gnt5 ) expression in gastric epithelial cells .
beta3gnt5 is a glycosyltransferase and is essential for the biosynthesis of the lewis antigens .
furthermore , the induction of beta3gnt5 is dependent on tnf , but not on il - 8 .
in regard to the binding capacity of h. pylori via saba , beta3gnt5 expression was shown to increase the cell adhesion rates for saba - positive h. pylori strains [ 24 ] .
in addition , acid - responsive signaling in h. pylori regulates saba transcription [ 25 ] .
these data indicate that h. pylori adaptation to the environment is a precursor of adhesion via saba ; subsequently , inflammation might support h. pylori colonization of gastric epithelial cells ( figure 1 ) .
5. baba baba was identified as the first adhesin molecule of h. pylori , and this protein can bind to the lewis b ( leb ) blood group antigen [ 26,27 ] .
subsequent studies demonstrated that baba has adapted to fucosylated blood group antigens , which are most prevalent in certain local populations [ 28 ] .
in europe and the united states , where blood groups a , b , and o are common , h. pylori strains can bind to blood groups a , b , and o type 1 determinants ( h type 1 determinants ) ; this is referred to as a " generalist strain. " meanwhile , a " specialist strain " can bind to h type 1 determinants only .
a specialist strain was found in the south american native population , in which only the blood group o phenotype is present .
recently , the globo h hexaglycosylceramide , e.g. , the blood group o determinant on a type 4 core chain , was suggested to be a novel glycosphingolipid binding partner for baba [ 29 ] .
both strains can bind the globo h hexaglycosylceramide ; however , only the generalist strain can bind the globo a heptaglycosylceramide , e.g. , the blood group a determinant on a type 4 core chain .
baba is suggested to enhance caga translocation into gastric cells and induce severe inflammation in the stomach ( figure 1 ) [ 30 ] .
triple - positive ( baba , vaca - s1 type , caga ) h. pylori can colonize a greater proportion of the gastric mucosa , and induce severe inflammation in the stomach [ 31 ] .
in addition , triple - positive h. pylori - infected patients exhibit a higher incidence of intestinal metaplasia , compared to that in patients infected with double - positive ( vaca - s1 type , caga ) h. pylori [ 32 ] .
recently , the extracellular domain of baba was crystallized , and this provided new insights into the protein features .
moonens et al. identified the domain of baba that is responsible for interaction with blood group antigens .
furthermore , n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) , a redox - active compound , was shown to disrupt the disulfide bond of the interaction domain , inactivate the binding properties of baba , and thus block baba - mediated adherence to the gastric mucosa of mice [ 33 ] .
in addition , treatment of h. pylori - infected leb - expressing mice with nac lowers gastric mucosal neutrophil infiltration .
this might provide the basis for possible h. pylori eradication therapies .
6. oipa oipa was initially identified as a protein that induces a pro - inflammatory response based on the fact that an oipa mutant resulted in the reduced production of il - 8 in a gastric epithelial cell line [ 34 ] .
in contrast , some studies have indicated that oipa plays a role in h. pylori adhesion to host cells and does not influence the production of il - 8 in gastric cells [ 35,36 ]. whether oipa can induce il - 8 production is controversial .
the functional status of oipa is regulated by slipped strand mispairing , which is the same mechanism utilized by saba [ 34,35,36,37 ] .
many omp family genes demonstrate a loss of one resident locus ( hopm / n , baba / b / c , and saba / b ) , whereas it was reported that the oipa locus was duplicated , referred to as oipa - 2 [ 38 ] .
oipa - 2 is found in h. pylori hspeasia and hspamerind strains , but not in hpeurope or hspwafrica strains , based on multi - locus sequence typing analysis .
the role of oipa as an adhesion molecule is suggested by in vitro experiments using gastric epithelial cells [ 34,35,39 ] .
however , results in an animal model indicate that the adhesive action of oipa is dependent on the h. pylori strain .
akanuma and colleagues reported that the oipa - mutant h. pylori tn2 strain does not infect mongolian gerbils [ 40 ] .
in contrast , franco and co - workers reported that the oipa - mutant h. pylori 7.13 strain infected mongolian gerbils ; however , oipa mutant strain - infected animals did not develop gastric cancer , whereas 27 % of those infected with the wild - type strain did develop this condition [ 41 ] .
thus , the adhesion of oipa depends on h. pylori strain and controversial .
therefore , it is difficult to demonstrate the relationships between oipa status and molecular processes as well as clinical outcomes .
based on epidemiological studies , functional oipa correlates with other virulence factors such as cag pai , vaca - s1 type , and vaca - m1 type [ 35,42,43,44 ] .
therefore , it is difficult to demonstrate the direct function of oipa by using mutant h. pylori strains ; however , oipa - related signaling has been reported .
oipa is suggested to induce the remodeling of actin stress fibers by activating the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) ; this leads to the activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( erk1 / 2 ) [ 45 ] .
oipa - mediated fak activation might be a consequence of altered epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) signaling .
oipa mutant h. pylori could not activate egfr - related signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) [ 45 ] , phosphoinositol dependent kinase - 1 ( pdk1 ) , and akt , which regulate foxo forkhead transcription factor activity , leading to il - 8 induction [ 46 ] .
recently , egfr / fak signaling was shown to lead to phosphorylation of paxillin and subsequent actin remodeling ( figure 1 ) [ 47 ] .
it is difficult to demonstrate the relationships between oipa status and clinical outcomes .
however , it is clear that oipa status is associated with the presence of the other virulence factors in h. pylori .
therefore , oipa might cooperate with other virulence factors during the pathogenesis of h. pylori .
7. hopq hopq is a paralog of the hop family that includes baba and saba [ 48 ] .
hopq is classified into type i and type ii alleles , and these alleles correlate with other virulence factors .
ping and timothy reported that type i hopq alleles are significantly more common in caga - positive and vaca - s1 type strains than in caga - negative and vaca - s2 strains [ 49 ] .
furthermore , based on an epidemiological study , it was revealed that type i hopq alleles are more common in east asian h. pylori strains [ 50 ] .
this indicates the presence of geographic differences for the hopq allele type , as with vaca and caga genotypes .
hopq was reported as a non - cagpai - encoded co - factor of the t4ss .
belogolva et al. suggested that hopq is essential for caga translocation , and that deletion of hopq reduces t4ss - dependent activation of signaling ( nf - kappab , mapk signaling , and il - 8 production ) [ 51 ] .
furthermore , this observation was reported in human granulocytes [ 52 ] .
recently , the carcinoembryonic antigen - related cell adhesion molecule family ( ceacams ) was defined as a group of host cell receptors for hopq .
ceacams have isoforms , and hopq binds the amino - terminal igv - like domain of human ceacam1 , ceacam3 , ceacam5 , and ceacam6 proteins .
based on the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of hopq , a beta - hairpin insertion in the extracellular 3 + 4 helix bundle domain of hopq is important for ceacam binding , and this determines the type of hopq allele .
a peptide derived from this domain competitively inhibits hopq - mediated cag translocation , similar to that observed with genetic or antibody - mediated abrogation of hopq function [ 53,54 ] .
this suggests the possibility that caga translocation is mediated not only by the t4ss , but also by membrane proteins ( figure 1 ) .
the ceacam - binding site of hopq has been found to exhibit sequence diversity .
therefore , such variations might affect the translocation of caga via the t4ss .
8. conclusions h. pylori expresses many different virulence factors .
the function of each virulence factor has gradually been revealed .
in regard to membrane proteins , the binding partners of baba , saba , and hopq were identified , and subsequently baba and hopq were suggested to enhance caga translocation into gastric cells via the t4ss .
in addition , many epidemiological studies have demonstrated that omps correlate with other virulence factors and clinical outcomes .
therefore , these proteins might have a dynamic function in cooperating with the t4ss and other factors .
however , less is known about the interplay between membrane proteins and the membrane region of h. pylori .
recently , it is clear that outer membrane vesicles ( omvs ) have a unique function .
omvs are involved with periplasmic and outer membrane proteins , peptideglycanes , lipopiolysaccharides , dna , rna , and enzymes .
omvs are also involved in a mechanism to transfer virulence factors and maintain bacteria communities .
thus , omps at movs might play an important role in communicating with bacteria .
studies that focus on local or temporal interactions among virulence factors and the other molecules are required for a deeper understanding of the dynamic pathogenesis and communication of h. pylori .
many studies demonstrated that h. pylori utilize omps to colonize the human stomach .
this indicates that omps might be a vaccine candidate .
in fact , many reports suggested that omps might be a candidate as a vaccine based on in vitro experiments .
however , there has been no report that shows that omps are useful as target molecules for vaccines in animal models .
an animal model is essential to demonstrate the efficacy of a vaccine .
thus , this problem needs to be overcome to produce a vaccine for h. pylori infection .

( a ) baba interacts with lea antigen and enhances caga translocation via the type 4 secretion system ( t4ss ) .
hopq interacts with ceacams , and is essential for caga translocation .
baba and hopq might interact with the t4ss in the membrane region of h. pylori , although this is unclear .
( b ) absence of slex antigen expression in the healthy stomach. h. pylori infection induces beta3gnt5 expression in gastric epithelial cells and biosynthesis of the slex antigen ; slex localizes to the membrane region of gastric epithelial cells .
as a result , h. pylori can colonize by utilizing saba , which interacts with the slex antigen .
although the detailed mechanism is unclear , tnf and the t4ss are suggested to induce beta3gnt5 expression .
( c ) oipa is suggested to induce phosphorylation of egfr , leading to activation of focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) and akt - related signaling .
activated fak induces actin stress fiber remodeling via the mapk and erk1 / 2 signaling pathway .
in addition , phosphorylation of akt can activate foxo transcription factors and induce il - 8 production .
the binding partner of oipa and whether oipa can cooperate with the t4ss are unclear .

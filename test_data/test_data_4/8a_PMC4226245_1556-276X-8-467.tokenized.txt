smart drug delivery systems that are triggered by environmental conditions have been developed to enhance cancer therapeutic efficacy while limiting unwanted effects .
because cancer exhibits abnormally high local acidities compared to normal tissues ( ph 7.4 ) due to warburg effects , ph - sensitive systems have been researched for effective cancer therapy .
chitosan - based intelligent theragnosis nanocomposites , n - naphthyl - o - dimethymaleoyl chitosan - based drug - loaded magnetic nanoparticles ( nchitosan - dmnps ) , were developed in this study .
nchitosan - dmnps are capable of ph - sensitive drug release with mr - guided images because doxorubicin ( dox ) and magnetic nanocrystals ( mncs ) are encapsulated into the designed n - naphthyl - o - dimethymaleoyl chitosan ( n - nap - o - malcs ) .
this system exhibits rapid dox release as acidity increases , high stability under high ph conditions , and sufficient capacity for diagnosing and monitoring therapeutic responses .
these results demonstrate that nchitosan - dmnps have potential as theragnosis nanocomposites for effective cancer therapy .
theragnosis cancer therapy drug delivery ph - sensitive magnetic resonance imaging nanocomposites background many therapeutic anticancer drugs are limited in their clinical applications because of their toxicities and low solubility in aqueous media [ 1 - 14 ] .
for instance , doxorubicin ( dox ) is one of the most widely used drugs in cancer therapy .
however , it can cause side effects such as cardiotoxicity and drug resistance .
also , it is difficult to administer intravenously because of its low solubility in aqueous media .
nanomaterial - based drug delivery systems have received attention in overcoming this drawback .
these systems can be made from a variety of organic and inorganic materials including non - degradable and biodegradable polymers , and inorganic nanocrystals .
polymeric micelles based on amphiphilic block copolymers have the advantages of high biocompatibility and drug - loading capacity with low toxicity because they can self - assemble into polymeric micelles in aqueous media [ 8,15 - 17 ] .
they accumulate in tumors through an enhanced permeation and retention ( epr ) effect compared to single small molecules , leading to preferential spatio - distribution in the tumor .
however , the drug release behavior of polymeric micelles is difficult to control ; they freely release the drug before reaching tumors , which could give rise to unwanted side effects and low therapeutic efficacy [ 4,8 ] .
well - designed drug delivery systems need to be developed to enable cancer chemotherapy that fundamentally enhances therapeutic efficacy by minimizing drug release in undesirable sites. with these systems , a precise drug concentration can be delivered to tumors to reduce side effects .
drug delivery systems can be designed to release drugs triggered by environmental parameters such as ph , enzymes , and temperature [ 16,18 - 29 ] .
the ph - sensitive systems are of special interest because tumors and intracellular endosomal / lysomal compartments exhibit abnormally high local acidities compared to healthy tissues with a normal physiological ph of 7.4 [ 9,21,25,28 - 43 ] .
in this study , chitosan - based intelligent theragnosis nanocomposites that enable ph - sensitive drug release with magnetic resonance ( mr ) - guided images were developed ( figure 1 ) .
this nanocomposite was based on n - naphthyl - o - dimethymaleoyl chitosan ( n - nap - o - malcs ) , a newly synthesized , ph - sensitive amphiphilic copolymer modified by maleoyl groups on a chitosan backbone .
chitosan is non - toxic , biodegradable , and non - immunogenic [ 44 - 72 ] .
it is a linear polysaccharide consisting of n - acetyl - glucosamine ( acetylated ) and glucosamine ( deacetylated ) repeating units , and its abundant reactive groups facilitate chemical modification of functional groups .
hydrophobic magnetic nanocrystals were loaded as imaging agents in this system , leading to the formulation of theragnosis nanocomposites capable of delivery therapy concomitant with monitoring .
this nanocomposite will allow effective cancer therapy because it can provide patient - specific drug administration strategies that consider drug - release patterns and biodistribution .

the cells were washed three times with pbs and stained by hoechst ( molecular probes tm , or , usa ) to show nucleus location .
fluorescence microscopic images were obtained using a laser scanning confocal microscope ( lsm700 , carl zeiss , jena , germany ) .

all experiments were conducted in triplicate .
determination of cell viability using mtt assay the cell viability of nchitosan - dmnps was evaluated by measuring cell growth inhibition using a 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2,5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( mtt ) assay ( roche molecular biochemicals , mannheim , germany ) compared to dox as a control .
nih3t6.7 cells ( 1.0 x 104 cells / well ) were implanted in a 96 - microwell plate with temperature at 37degreesc overnight and treated with various concentrations of nchitosan - dmnps .

results and discussion characterization of n - naphthyl - o - dimethymaleoyl chitosan n - naphthyl - o - dimethymaleoyl chitosan was synthesized by modifying chitosan with naphthyl groups at amino groups to complement their solubility and introduce amphiphilic properties [ 79 ] .
chitosan was reacted with naphthaldehyde to obtain an imine ( schiff base ) , which is easily converted into an n - naphthyl derivate by reduction with sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride ( figure 2a ) .
afterward , n - napcs was introduced into the hydroxyl groups of chitosan by maleoylation with dimethylmaleic anhydride in dmf / dmso to obtain n - nap - o - malcs ( figure 2b ) [ 67,68 ] .
this synthetic compound was characterized by a 1h - nmr spectrum , and satisfactory analysis data were obtained ( figure 3 ) .
n - nap - o - malcs was used to form nanopolymeric micelles by dialysis in various ph solutions .
they were less than 200 nm at ph 7.2 to 8.0 but rapidly increased in size as the acidity of solution increased ( figure 4 ) .
their sizes could not be measured at ph 5.5 and 6.0 ( figure 4a ) due to aggregation .
this was a result of the weakened solubility of n - nap - o - malcs in the aqueous phase caused by acid hydrolysis of its maleoyl groups [ 80,81 ] .
this phenomenon accelerated at 37degreesc compared to 25degreesc ( figure 4b ) .
n - nap - o - malcs has a potential as a drug carrier because it can self - assemble with ph - sensitive behavior [ 67,68,79,82 ] .

characterization of n - naphthyl - o - dimethymaleoyl chitosan - based drug - loaded magnetic nanoparticles nchitosan - dmnps were prepared by a nanoemulsion method , in which naphtyl groups were absorbed on the hydrophobic surface of mncs and dox mainly caused by van der waals force , and both their oxygen atoms and water molecules were interacted by hydrogen bonding .
this interaction could lead to formation of nchitosan - dmnps dispersed in aqueous phase with high colloidal stability .
nchitosan - dmnps were loaded with 27.5 wt. % mncs and exhibited superparamagnetic behavior with a magnetization saturation value of 40.4 emu / gfe + mn at 1.2 t ( figure 5 ) .
in addition , iron ( fe ) and manganese ( mn ) were not detected by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) analysis , which indicates that mncs were safely encapsulated inside the nchitosan - dmnps ( figure 5 ) .
the availability of nchitosan - dmnps as mri contrast agents was evaluated by measuring spin - spin relaxation times ( t2 ) of water protons in the aqueous solutions using 1.5 - t mr images .
as the concentration of mncs ( fe + mn ) in nchitosan - dmnps increased , the mr image was proportionally darkened with an r2 coefficient of 254.6 / mms , demonstrating that nchitosan - dmnps have sufficient ability as mri contrast agents ( figure 6 ) .

( a ) t2 - weighted mr images of nchitosan - dmnps in aqueous solution and ( b ) relaxation rate ( r2 ) versus nchitosan - dmnps concentration .
ph - sensitive drug release properties to investigate the ph - dependent behavior of nchitosan - dmnps , they were dispersed in different ph solutions ( ph 5.5 , 7.4 , and 9.8 ) and their sizes were analyzed using laser scattering .
nchitosan - dmnps in a ph 9.8 solution showed stable particle size around 100 nm ( 100.3 +/ - 4.9 nm ) , but their sizes increased slightly with increased buffer solution acidity ( ph 5.5 , 185.3 +/ - 13.5 nm and ph 7.4 , 158.8 +/ - 10.6 nm ) ( figure 7a ) [ 17,20,30,83,84 ] .
this is because the solubility of n - nap - o - malcs of nchitosan - dmnps was weakened by acid hydrolysis of maleoyl groups , as mentioned above .
this ph - dependent behavior was expected to induce ph - sensitive drug release profiles .
dox was abruptly released from nchitosan - dmnps under acidic conditions ( ph 5.5 ) with about 90 % of drug release within 24 h ( figure 7b ) , whereas only 20 % of dox was released at higher ph conditions ( ph 7.4 and 9.8 ) during the same time period and both release profiles showed sustained release patterns for 8 days .
this result implies that drugs could be released more from nchitosan - dmnps in acidic tumor sites than in normal tissues with decreased drug loss during blood circulation .
after nchitosan - dmnps internalization by endocytosis , drug release could be further accelerated inside the acidic endosomes of tumor cells .

cellular uptake and cytotoxicity nih3t6.7 cells were treated with nchitosan - dmnps and observed by confocal laser fluorescence microscopy to confirm their cellular uptake .
blue fluorescence indicated cell nuclei by hoechst stains and red fluorescent signals are derived from cell nuclei and dox .
in figure 8a , red fluorescence was generally observed in the intracellular regions , indicating released dox from internalized nchitosan - dmnps .
nih3t6.7 cells incubated with nchitosan - dmnps also showed mr contrast effects compared to non - treated cells ( non - treatment ) ( figure 8b ) .
the mr signal of nih3t6.7 cells treated with nchitosan - dmnps was about 1.72 - fold higher than that of non - treated cells , with an r2 value of 22.1 / s ( r2 value of non - treated cells : 8.10 / s ) .
the cytotoxicity of nchitosan - dmnps against nih3t6.7 cells was evaluated by mtt assay ( figure 9 ) [ 85 - 87 ] .
dox - treated cells were also evaluated under the same conditions as a control .

figure 9 cell viability test of cells treated with dox and n chitosan - dmnps ( red , n chitosan - dmnps ; blue , dox ) .
dox and nchitosan - dmnps exhibited dose - dependent cytotoxic effects on nih3t6.7 .
dox showed a higher cytotoxicity than nchitosan - dmnps because nchitosan - dmnps released dox after their cellular internalization , while free dox directly diffused and penetrated through cell membranes due to its low molecular weight .
in vivo theranostic effects of nchitosan - dmnps the theranostic effects of nchitosan - dmnps were confirmed against an in vivo model [ 9,88,89 ] .
to determine the therapeutic dosing schedule , intratumoral distributions of nchitosan - dmnps in tumor - bearing mice were investigated through mr images after intravenous injection into mouse tail veins ( 150 mug fe + mn , 3 mg / kg dox ) .
after injecting nchitosan - dmnps ( post - injection ) , the black color gradually spread out in t2 - weighted mr images following the peripheral blood vessels of the tumor area .
this resulted from diffusion and permeation to tumor tissues across corresponding vascular distributions by an epr effect ( figure 10a ) .
the therapeutic dosing of nchitosan - dmnps were determined because these were maximally delivered within 1 h at the tumor sites and then over 80 % of drug was released in the in the acidic environments within the tumor for 24 h , as judged from in vivo mri and drug release profiling studies .
considering these results , we determined 2 days periodically to consistently maintain drug concentration within tumors for effective cancer therapy .
nchitosan - dmnps , free dox , and saline were administrated to each subgroup of tumor - bearing mice via intravenous ( i.v. ) injection every 2 days for 12 days ( injection on days 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12 ) .
tumor sizes were monitored for 24 days .
nchitosan - dmnps exhibited significant tumor growth inhibition with an average tumor growth rate of 1,638.1 +/ - 306.9 % compared to the control ( free dox and saline ) groups ( saline , 4,642.8 % ; free dox , 2,991.9 %) ( figure 10b ) .
although nchitosan - dmnps could not completely suppress tumor growth , tumor growth inhibition was more effective than with saline or free dox .
during the experimental period , no loss in mice body weight was observed .

conclusions we have formulated theranostic nanocomposites , nchitosan - dmnps , based on n - nap - o - malcs for effective cancer therapy .
nchitosan - dmnps exhibited a ph - sensitive drug release pattern with mr imaging due to the ph - sensitive properties of n - nap - o - malcs .
furthermore , theragnostic efficacies of nchitosan - dmnps were confirmed in the in vivo model by determining their therapeutic dosing schedule based on drug release profiling and in vivo mri study. from these results , nchitosan - dmnps are expected to play a significant role in the dawning era of personalized medicine .

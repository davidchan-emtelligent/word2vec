recent high - throughput - sequencing of the cancer genome has identified oncogenic mutations in braf genetic locus as one of the critical events in melanomagenesis .
in normal cells , the activity of braf is tightly regulated .
gain - of - function mutations like those identified in melanoma frequently lead to enhanced cell - survival and unrestrained growth .
the activating mutation of braf will also induce the cells to senesce .
however , the mechanism by which the oncogenic braf induces the senescent barrier remains poorly defined .
micrornas have regulatory functions toward the expression of genes that are important in carcinogenesis .
here we show that expression of several micrornas is altered when the oncogenic version of braf is introduced in cultured primary melanocytes and these cells undergo premature cellular senescence .
these include eight micrornas whose expression rates are significantly stimulated and three that are repressed .
while most of the induced micrornas have documented negative effects on cell cycle progression , one of the repressed micrornas has proven oncogenic functions .
ectopic expression of some of these induced micrornas increased the expression of senescence markers and induced growth arrest and senescence in primary melanocytes .
taken together , our results suggest that the change in microrna expression rates may play a vital role in senescence induced by the oncogenic braf .
1. introduction unregulated oncogene expression during cancer development causes cancer cells to senesce prematurely , a gene - directed program that irrevocably induces cell cycle arrest [ 1 - 4 ] .
first described in cell culture [ 5 ] , oncogene - induced senescence ( ois ) has been confirmed in vivo as a vital mechanism that constrains the malignant progression of many tumors [ 3 ] .
unregulated oncoproteins promote senescence by activating effector pathways that are cell - type and oncogene specific .
recent progress identified different regulatory circuitries of ois , but much remains to be learned [ 6 ] .
high - throughput sequencing of the cancer genomes has identified braf kinase as the most frequently mutated ( 50 - 70 %) oncogene in melanoma [ 7 ] .
about 90 % of braf gain - of - function mutations are at position 600 with glutamic acid ( e ) inserted for valine ( v ) [ 7 ] .
braf is a serine / threonine protein kinase that functions directly downstream of the small gtpase ras and upstream of the mek and erk mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) cascade .
this mutation significantly increases braf kinase activity toward mek , causing constitutive braf - mek - erk signaling [ 7 , 8 ] .
the braf gain - of - function val to glu mutation is required for cell viability , anchorage - independent growth , and proliferation of brafv600e - positive melanoma cell lines in both cell - based studies and in vivo mouse models [ 9 - 11 ] .
furthermore , a phase i clinical trial with a potent inhibitor of brafv600e kinase demonstrates that braf - mutant melanomas are highly dependent on braf kinase activity [ 12 ] .
besides its frequent presence in melanoma , braf v600e mutations are also present in up to 82 % of melanocytic nevi with classical hallmarks of senescence [ 13 ] .
importantly , sustained brafv600e expression in human melanocytes induces premature senescence [ 13 ] .
the gain - of - function mutation in braf may be the cause of growth arrest in nevi .
indeed , in studies with genetically modified mouse models , the activated braf v600e allele plays a causal role in promoting benign melanocytic hyperplasia in vivo [ 14 , 15 ] .
however the underlying mechanisms driving b - rafv600e - mediated senescence in melanocytes remain undefined .
micrornas are small noncoding rna species of 20 - 22 nucleotides that have critical functions across a myriad of biological processes [ 16 - 19 ] .
aberrant expression of several micrornas has also been reported in melanocytic nevi [ 20 ] .
in view of the emerging important role of micrornas in tumorigenesis and cell - cycle arrest , micrornas may play a causal role in brafv600e - induced senescence in melanocytic nevi .
brafv600e - induced senescence requires the activation of a transcription program with multiple components [ 21 - 23 ] .
the mechanism that integrates the diverse components into a coordinated response to the brafv600e mutation remains undefined .
each microrna targets ~ 200 mrna molecules [ 18 ] .
because of their pleiotropic potentials , micrornas are attractive candidates as master regulators of the premature senescence transcription program .
in this study , by ectopically expressing brafv600e in primary melanocytes , we identified 8 different micrornas whose expressions were correlated with the braf gain - of - function activity .
importantly , two of the identified micrornas , when expressed individually , are sufficient to induce premature senescence in primary melanocytes in the absence of braf mutation .
2. results and discussion to identify putative micrornas involved in ois , we detected micrornas induced by braf v600e in melanocytes using a focused pcr - based microarray system that enabled assessment of 52 micrornas ( sabiosciences ) .
as expected , expression of brafv600e in primary human melanocytes induced constitutively high levels of erk1 / 2 phosphorylation ( figure 1 ( a )) promoting growth arrest ( figure 1 ( b )) and senescence as detected by the expression of senescence - associated beta - galactosidase ( sa - beta - gal ) ( figure 1 ( c )) , dec1 , p16 , p15 , and dcr2 ( figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( d )) .
at a time point prior to the detection of senescence , we collected total rna and enriched for small rnas as recommended by the manufacturer. by enriching for small rnas , this system is designed to detect mature microrna expression levels .
the levels of each microrna were quantified relative to the levels of four control small rnas .
among the 52 micrornas that we examined , 13 were significantly induced and three ( mir - 10b , - 15b , and - 16 ) were greatly repressed by braf v600e in primary melanocytes ( data not shown ) .
subsequently , quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) was used to further examine the effect of braf v600e on the expression of these micrornas with specific primers for each individual microrna .
eight out of the 13 that were stimulated in the original screen were consistently induced more than 2 - fold by braf v600e ( figure 2 ) .
based on the documented expression of these micrornas in clinical melanocytic nevi , we selected four of them for further study [ 20 , 24 , 25 ] .
to examine their causal role in cellular senescence in melanocytes , we expressed individual micrornas in primary human skin melanocytes by retroviral transduction .
the expression of micrornas was confirmed by qrt - pcr with specific primers ( figure 3 ( a )) .
the effects of individual microrna expression on the expression of five senescence markers were determined by qrt - pcr ( figures 3 ( b ) - 3 ( e )) .
three out of the four micrornas tested had an observable effect on the expression of at least one of the senescence markers .
these are micrornas 143 , 34a , and 29a .
while expression of mir - 34a increased p16ink4a , p15ink4b , dcr2 , and dec1 transcripts , expression of mir - 143 , or 29a increased the p15ink4b and dcr2 transcripts ( figures 3 ( c ) - 3 ( e )) .
to investigate directly their role in cellular senescence , we measured cell proliferation by quantifying the number of melanocytes expressing the proliferation marker protein ki - 67 due to the expression of mir - 143 , 34a , or 29a .
expression of mir - 143 or - 34a but not - 29a or - 100 led to a decrease in melanocyte proliferation as measured by the expression of proliferation marker protein ki - 67 .
importantly , the decreased expression of ki - 67 correlated with intense activity of sa - beta - gal ( figure 3 ( f )) .
oncogenic braf induced premature senescence in melanocytes with a concomitant increase in the expression of senescence markers p16ink4a , p15ink4b , dec1 , and dcr2 .
in addition , we showed that oncogenic braf also significantly increased the expression of mir - 143 , mir - 34a , let - 7c , mir - 15a , mir - 29a , mir - 100 , mir - 181a , and mir - 181d. by specific watson - crick base pairing between the seed region of microrna and sites within the mrna 3'utr , each microrna can potentially target different groups of mrnas for regulation .
expression of mir - 143 , - 34a , or - 29a led to the increased expression of some of the senescence markers .
it is therefore possible that a combined expression of the identified micrornas is responsible for the observed upregulation of senescence markers in oncogenic braf expressing melanocytes .
among the micrornas that are induced by the braf gain - of - function mutation , only mir - 143 or - 34a is sufficient to induce growth arrest and senescence when ectopically expressed in primary melanocytes .
mir - 34a negatively regulates cell cycle g1 / s transition genes cyclin d1 , cyclin e2 , cdk4 , and cdk6 and causes g1 arrest [ 26 - 28 ] when expressed in human primary diploid fibroblasts .
in human cancer cells , mir - 143 is one of the most notable tumor suppressor mir - rnas , which can directly inhibit oncogene kras translation and block the downstream signal pathways [ 29 ] .
restoring mir - 143 expression inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis by targeting bcl2 [ 30 , 31 ] .
in agreement with these studies , we showed that mir - 34a or - 143 induced premature senescence in primary human melanocytes .
ectopic expression of mir - 34a increased expression of p16ink4a , p15ink4b , dec1 , and dcr2 .
unlike mir - 34a , mir - 143 only increased expression of p15ink4b and dcr2 .
since both mir - 34a and - 143 expression caused senescence , it can be inferred that expression of p16ink4a or dec1 is not essential for oncogenic braf - mediated premature senescence .
concordantly , the presence of p16ink4a was also previously found not to be required for senescence induced by gain - of - function braf mutation in melanocytes [ 13 ] .
it is presently not clear which mrnas , mir - 34a or - 143 , target for repression in melanocytes , nor do we know how oncogenic braf induces their expression. by targeting different subset of genes for regulation , micrornas can function either as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes .
as expected , all the identified induced mir - rnas have tumor suppressive functions .
for instance , mir - 29 , which has three family members , negatively impinges on cancer cell survival by directly targeting the mrnas of the regulatory subunit of pi3 kinase ( p85a ) and cdc42 for regulation .
mir - 29a could also directly decrease cdk6 expression and cause g1 / s growth arrest in [ 32 ] .
consistent with its tumor suppressive role , mir - 29 expression is frequently downregulated in multiple cancers .
however despite its proven role in cell cycle regulation , expression of mir - 29a is not sufficient to induce senescence in melanocytes .
it is possible that mir - 29a is required but not sufficient for oncogenic braf - induced senescence .
it is also possible that the effect of mir - 29a on cell cycle progression is cell - context dependent .
we reason that if microrna is part of the mechanism that integrates the diverse components into a coordinated response to the braf v600e mutation , we should also observe downregulation of oncogenic micrornas .
indeed , mir - 10b , which increases the expression of oncogene rhoc by directly targeting its transcriptional repressor hoxd10 [ 33 ] , is consistently repressed in melanocytes harboring the braf v600e mutation .
in addition to mir - 10b , we also observed expression levels of mir - 15b and - 16 downregulated .
mir - 15 / 16 belongs to a very unique group of micrornas .
mir - 16 has 2 transcripts - - one is called mir - 16 - 1 located on chromosome ( chr ) 13 and shares the same transcript with mir - 15a forming the mir - 15a / 16 cluster .
the other mir - 16 is named mir - 16 - 2 , which together with mir - 15b is located at chr 3 as the mir - 15b / 16 cluster .
interestingly while mir - 15b and 16 were downregulated , the mir - 15a was upregulated in melanocytes expressing braf v600e .
since our mir - 16 primer detected both mir - 16 - 1 and - 16 - 2 transcripts , it is unknown at present which mir - 16 was downregulated by oncogenic braf expression .
the mir - 15 / 16 family is known to have a negative effect on cell proliferation by targeting mrnas for various cell - growth - associated genes [ 34 - 36 ] .
it is therefore not clear why the downregulation of mir - 15b and - 16 is favored in melanocytes , which are undergoing senescence .
alternatively it is also possible that mir - 5b / 16 has unidentified oncogene targets .
although it is clear that braf induces senescence in melanocytes by activating mek and erk , the downstream effectors of its cytostatic effect remain to be identified [ 13 , 37 ] .
braf v600e - mediated senescence also requires additional effector pathways involving several immune and growth mediators such as il6 , il8 , and igfbp7 [ 6 ] .
however , the mechanism that integrates the diverse pathways into a coordinate response to oncogenic stimulation has not been defined .
in this study , we identified several micrornas whose expression rates were stimulated by oncogenic braf .
expression of four of these micrornas induced the expression senescence - surrogate markers .
among them , mir - 143 or - 34a alone can induce growth arrest and senescence when expressed in primary melanocytes .
melanoma is a cancer of melanocytes and is the most deadly form of skin cancer .
the transformation of melanocytes to malignant melanoma is a stepwise process fueled by the accumulation of mutations in critical growth and survival regulatory genes .
the development of benign nevi from melanocytes is the first phenotypic change that can be detected during the progression of normal melanocytes to malignant melanoma .
studies with mouse models have demonstrated the causal role of the activated braf v600e allele in promoting benign melanocytic hyperplasia [ 14 , 15 ] .
the underlying mechanisms that drive the transformation of melanocytes to a precancerous nevi are poorly understood .
since micrornas have multiple regulatory targets [ 18 ] , our results together with the expression of these micrornas in clinical melanocytic nevi [ 20 ] strongly suggest that the identified micrornas may play a vital coordinative role in braf - induced senescence in melanocytic nevi .
it is conceivable that benign nevi transform into melanoma of uncontrolled growth following subsequent mutations that inactivate the oncogenic b - raf - mediated senescence pathways .
as such a thorough understanding of how oncogenic braf induces senescence will allow us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that drive the conversion of melanocytes to preneoplastic nevi and transition to melanoma .

british journal of cancer 2006 95 4 496 505 16880792 figure 1 melanocytes were infected with control retroviral empty vector ( evc ) or with a vector expressing brafv600e .
four days after infection , cells were harvested for ( a ) immunoblotting with specific abs as indicated or ( d ) total rna .
the expression levels of the indicated senescence markers in brafv600e expressing or control cells were quantified by qrt - pcr and normalized to the level of b - actin .
the values represent the means and standard deviation from three independent experiments .
cells were also isolated 4 days after infection , fixed , and stained for ( b ) ki - 67 or ( c ) sa - beta - gal activity .
insets : representative fields are shown for control evc and b - rafv600e expressing cells stained with ki - 67 ab or positive for sa - beta - gal activity .

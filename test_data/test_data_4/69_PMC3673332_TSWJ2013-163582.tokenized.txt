1. introduction bacterial conjunctivitis is one of the most frequent hospital - acquired infections of the newborn .
a few centers have recently reported the prevalence of hospital - acquired conjunctivitis ( hac ) among neonatal intensive care unit ( nicu ) patients , despite using variable diagnostic criteria [ 1 - 4 ] .
the spectrum of hac infectious agents differs with geographic location , prophylactic ophthalmic antibiotic use , and specific health care facility microflora .
in areas where universal prophylaxis is performed and where most pregnancies are adequately followed , common pathogens include staphylococcus aureus , staphylococcus epidermidis , escherichia coli , and other gram - negative bacteria .
coagulase - negative staphylococci are usually classified as commensal bacteria , although some reports [ 1 - 3 ] have listed them as the major cause of neonatal hac .
hospitalized newborns are particularly susceptible to bacterial conjunctivitis ; their immature immune system is oftentimes challenged by adverse clinical conditions , medical devices , and invasive procedures .
when left untreated , hacs can lead to severe sequelae , depending on the pathogen involved [ 5 ] .
surveillance is essential in order to recognize potential risk factors , help delineate prevention strategies , and adjust the antibiotics used for conjunctivitis prophylaxis and treatment .
the aims of our work were to identify epidemiologic characteristics , including predisposing factors , pathogenic agents , and susceptibility patterns of bacterial hospital - acquired conjunctivitis in a level iii neonatal unit .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
setting the study was performed in a neonatal unit with 6 intensive care and 12 level ii care beds , with an average of 500 annual admissions .
this nicu is located at a central hospital in vila nova de gaia , portugal .
2.2 .
study population all neonates admitted to the nicu between january 1 , 2009 , and december 31 , 2011 , were included .
2.3 .
data collection data were collected retrospectively and consisted of demographic characteristics ( e.g. , gestational age , and birth weight ) , device utilization ( mechanical ventilation , and phototherapy ) , procedures ( e.g. , surgery ) , parenteral nutritional support , sepsis occurrence , isolated pathogens , antibiotic susceptibility patterns , and clinical outcomes .
part of this information was only collected regarding neonates with hac .
since all data had already been collected for clinical purposes and were available on patient charts and / or laboratory databases , the study did not require specific approval by the ethics committee .
2.4 .
case - finding procedures laboratory databases were searched for all registers of ocular exudates with positive bacterial cultures .
patients were then identified and selected if hac diagnostic criteria were met , according to the cdc / nhsn 2008 guidelines .
patients presenting two or more bacteria isolated from the same sample were also included , if these were known pathogens .
for the purpose of this study , purulent exudate samples where coagulase - negative staphylococci were the only bacteria found were not included .
2.5 .
microbiologic procedures ocular exudates from patients conjunctivae were collected by nurses , when clinically indicated , using amies transport swab with charcoal .
swabs were sent to the laboratory , where they were inoculated onto four bacteriological culture media : chocolate agar , macconkey agar , columbia colistin - nalidixic acid ( can ) agar , and chocolate agar + polyvitex vcat3 .
plates were incubated at 35degreesc in 5 % to 7 % co2 , for 72 hours , and were examined daily for detection of bacterial growth .
organisms were identified by the automated system vitek 2 and by conventional biochemical tests .
susceptibility testing was performed in accordance with the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) microdilution method .
ocular exudates were not routinely tested for viral pathogens or chlamydia .
2.6 .
data analysis data were analyzed through spss version 16.0 , using descriptive statistics and chi - square test , as appropriate .
3. results 3.1 .
study population a total of 1492 neonates were admitted during the study period .
general characteristics of the population are shown in table 1 .
3.2 .
incidence of conjunctivitis hospital - acquired conjunctivitis was diagnosed in 60 ( 4,0 %) of 1492 neonates admitted during the study period .
patients' characteristics are shown in table 2 .
one of the patients presented two separate episodes of conjunctivitis during her hospital stay .
most of the episodes concerned premature ( 75,4 %) and low - birth weight ( 75,4 %) neonates .
considering the study population demographics , males and females were similarly affected .
there was no significant difference between groups born by cesarean section or vaginal delivery .
extreme preterms and preterms born at 28 to 31 weeks gestational age were the most affected ( 27,8 % and 16,5 % , resp. ) , in accordance with the conjunctivitis distribution by birth weight , which involved 35,7 % of extremely low birth weight ( elbw ) and 20,8 % of very low birth weight ( vlbw ) neonates .
almost half ( 46,7 %) of patients who needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation ( nasal continuous positive airway pressure - - ncpap ) manifested an episode of conjunctivitis during their hospital stay , while hac incidence rate among those who did not use ncpap was much lower ( 2,76 %) .
neonates who underwent phototherapy presented an incidence rate of conjunctivitis of 6,8 % , notably higher than among those without phototherapy criteria ( 1,8 %) .
conjunctivitis affected 13,6 % of neonates on parenteral nutritional support and only 2,4 % of those under exclusive enteral feeding .
one patient was submitted to plastic surgery involving the face ( for pierre robin sequence ) before the onset of conjunctivitis .
none of them had undergone prior ophthalmologic observation for retinopathy of prematurity or other ophthalmologic procedures .
seven ( 11,7 %) of the patients who developed conjunctivitis had at least one episode of sepsis during their hospital stay .
only three of these presented a common pathogen to both infections - - e. coli in two cases and citrobacter koseri in the third one .
3.3 .
etiologic agents and susceptibility patterns the most frequently found agent was serratia marcescens , comprising 27,9 % of the isolates , followed by escherichia coli ( 23 %) and pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 18 %) , as summarized in table 3 .
over 89 % of isolated pathogens were gram - negative bacteria .
in 11,5 % ( n = 7 ) of cases , more than one pathogen was found in the same exudate sample .
serratia marcescens was significantly more prevalent among neonates who had prior phototherapy ( p = 0,003 ) .
susceptibility patterns of the most frequent bacterial isolates are summarized in table 4 .
topical gentamicin was the antibiotic used for empirical treatment of conjunctivitis while waiting for laboratory pathogen identification and susceptibility testing .
all patients had favorable outcomes .
4. discussion 4.1 .
hospital - acquired conjunctivitis definition previous epidemiological studies have used different hac definitions , such as one " occurring 48 hours or more after hospitalization and caused by bacterial or viral pathogens unrelated to maternal infection " [ 1 ] .
according to the cdc / nhsn 2008 guidelines [ 6 ] , " infections occurring in infants that result from passage through the birth canal are considered hospital - acquired infections. " considering that conjunctivitis and other neonatal infections that become apparent within the first 28 days of life could still be acquired during birth , distinction between hospital - related and maternal origins cannot be made with certainty , especially if the isolated pathogen is common to both environments .
therefore , none of the current hac definitions can be unequivocally applied .
newborns admitted to the nicu few days after birth manifesting signs of conjunctivitis less than 48 hours after hospitalization were excluded from this study .
although they could still be classified as having hac , the causative agent was probably less related to the nicu environment .
4.2 .
incidence found studies exclusively concerning neonates in nicus have found cumulative incidences of endemic conjunctivitis of 5 % [ 1 ] , 10 % [ 2 ] , 11,22 % [ 3 ] , and 17,7 % [ 4 ] .
we have found a slightly lower incidence of bacterial conjunctivitis ( 4,1 %) .
this might be related to the number of ocular exudates presenting coagulase - negative staphylococci ( cons ) that were not valued , to the exclusion of all exudates without an isolated pathogen or to the success of current infection control policies .
similar to other works , we did not include viral or fungal agents , nor did routinely perform investigation for chlamydia trachomatis infection .
4.3 .
isolated pathogens studies conducted by borer et al .
[ 3 ] , jeong et al .
[ 2 ] , and haas et al .
[ 1 ] have reported cons as the most frequent organisms causing hac , constituting 21 to 25 % of bacterial isolates .
coagulase - negative staphylococci are not usually considered pathogenic microorganisms by our laboratory criteria , particularly if the sample is found to have only modest bacterial growth or polymorphic flora .
other studies have reported s. aureus [ 7 ] , klebsiella [ 8 ] , and enterobacter spp .
[ 9 ] as the most common pathogens .
we have found a predominance of gram - negative bacteria ( 89 %) , particularly serratia marcescens .
this is an ubiquitous bacterium , whose complete eradication from the environment is often difficult .
nevertheless , the frequent finding of serratia conjunctival isolates was not associated with an increase in serratia bacteremia among our patients with hac .
neisseria gonorrhoeae , typically acquired from the colonized birth canal [ 10 ] , was not found in this study .
this might reflect the efficacy of neonatal ophthalmia prophylaxis performed at our hospital , although pregnant women were not routinely tested for gonococcus .
immediate postbirth ocular prophylaxis was performed with fusidic acid ( 1 %) in 2009 and 2010 and with oxytetracycline ( 0.5 %) in 2011 .
4.4 .
susceptibility patterns most gram - negative strains were resistant to several antibiotic classes .
serratia , pseudomonas , and citrobacter isolates had the most stable patterns , suggesting a common origin in the nicu .
klebsiella and e. coli , usually present in maternal birth canal , presented variable susceptibility patterns .
we did not detect the presence of methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus .
4.5 .
risk factors for hac according to previous studies [ 1 , 2 , 8 ] , our work showed a higher incidence of hac among lower birth weight and premature neonates , generally more vulnerable , as well as in the presence of known risk factors for hospital - acquired infection , such as parenteral nutrition [ 4 ] .
predominant risk factors identified in our work were phototherapy - - probably related to the use of ocular protection devices - - and noninvasive mechanical ventilation .
patients under ncpap usually need more frequent manipulations .
this , in association with conjunctival drying by air leaks , might contribute to an increased incidence of hac .
impaired tear drainage through the nasolacrimal duct is another possible mechanism .
4.6 .
limitations of this study because this study used a retrospective design , we did not have sufficient data for stronger statistical analysis of different groups , concerning hac risk factors .
other potential risk factors , such as the use of nasogastric tubes , were not investigated .
5. conclusions hospital - acquired conjunctivitis remains a frequent pathology among neonates .
infected conjunctivae constitute a potential reservoir for horizontal transmission of infection in the nicu if strict control measures are not adopted .
our work is an important contribution for the characterization of local microflora , although we cannot ascertain if isolated bacteria had maternal or nicu origin .
it would be important to perform similar surveillance studies in other institutions , given the variability of local microbiological patterns .
almost all the pathogens isolated were susceptible to topical gentamicin , the antibiotic of choice for empirical therapy in our nicu .
this raises the question if ocular samples should be routinely sent for laboratory examination .
nonetheless , we have found four strains with intermediate gentamicin susceptibility , which alerts us for the possibility of a future increase in gentamicin - resistant bacteria .

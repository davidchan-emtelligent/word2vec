no - reflow phenomenon is a risk factor which severely compromises the benefits of coronary revascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction .
inflammatory response , as an essential component of cardiac ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) injury , has been suggested to contribute to the myocardial no - reflow .
since nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kappab ) is a key mediator of inflammation , we reasoned that inhibition of nf - kappab might reduce the extent of no - reflow .
to test this hypothesis , the left circumflex coronary arteries of new zealand white male rabbits were ligated for 1.5 h , followed by reperfusion for 1 h to induce i / r injury .
pretreatment of the rabbits with a specific nf - kappab inhibitor , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( pdtc ) , significantly attenuated neutrophil infiltration in the no - reflow area as well as the expansion of no - reflow .
these beneficial effects were associated with a marked reduction in the serum levels of myocardial induced i / r tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) , intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( icam - 1 ) , and cxcl16 .
consistently , simulative i / r culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) resulted in an increase of tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 , and all of these changes were significantly suppressed by pretreatment of the cells with pdtc or with sirna - mediated p65 knockdown .
our data thus suggest that inhibition of nf - kappab may reduce i / r - associated myocardial no - reflow through reduction of myocardial inflammation .

introduction no - reflow ( nr ) phenomenon is the failure of blood to reperfuse an ischemic area after the physical obstruction has been removed or bypassed by percutaneous coronary intervention , thrombolysis and coronary artery bypass grafting [ 1 ] .
the incidence and extent of nr strongly predict adverse clinical outcomes including persistent contractile dysfunction of left ventricular , malignant arrhythmias and cardiac death [ 2 ] .
although the mechanisms of nr are not completely understood , existing evidences from both clinic setting [ 3 ] and animal nr model [ 4 ] support the involvement of ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) injury , vasospasm , neutrophils plugging , and endothelial swelling .
recently , it was reported that patients with higher c - reactive protein levels and white cell count tend to suffer from nr [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
this suggests the possibility that inflammatory cells and proinflammatory cytokines cells may directly mediate the occurrence and development of nr. however , the underlying mechanisms responsible for neutrophils infiltration and increased chemokine expression in nr have not been fully elucidated .
nuclear factor kappa - b ( nf - kappab ) is a key mediator of inflammation .
p50 / p65 heterodimer , which is one of the most avidly forming dimmers and is the major complex in most cells , is commonly referred specifically and hereinafter as nf - kappab .
p65 , in particular , was indicated to be involved in the inflammation of myocardial i / r injury [ 7 ] .
bound with its inhibitory ikb protein , nf - kappab is presented as an inactive complex in cytoplasm till extracellular signals activate ikb kinase which targets ikb for degradation and releases nf - kappab .
then the unmasked nf - kappab translocates into the nucleus to activate the pivot transcriptions of target genes and mediates immune and inflammatory responses by manipulating many inflammatory cytokines , adhesion molecules and chemokines .
activation of nf - kappab constitutes the central part of many cardiovascular inflammatory diseases .
inflammatory response is one of the main mechanisms of i / r injury [ 3 ] .
as the earliest initiation factor of inflammation , nf - kappab has been proven to play a key role in myocardial i / r process [ 8 ] .
however , whether nf - kappab is involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial nr remains unknown .
based on our previous observation that nf - kappab is markedly activated in the cardiac nr area ( data not shown ) , we speculate that nf - kappab may promote nr through mediating inflammation in response to myocardial i / r. to this end , we utilized a specific nf - kappab inhibitor , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( pdtc ) in a rabbit myocardial i / r model and investigated the association between the levels of nf - kappab , neutrophil infiltration , the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the extent of myocardial nr. furthermore , we performed simulative i / r culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) to determine the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the presence or absence of pdtc or specific p65 sirna .
materials and methods ethics statement all animals used in this study received humane care in compliance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals , nih publication , 1996 edition , and all the protocols were approved by the animal subjects committee of capital medical university , beijing , china .
rabbit myocardial ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) procedures new zealand white male rabbits weighing 2.0 - 3.0 kg ( aged 3 - 5 months ) were anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital ( 30 mg / kg iv. ) and the surgery was performed as following .
in brief , after 1.5 h ligation of the left circumflex ( lcx ) coronary artery , the occlusion was released for 1 h ( 10 rabbits per group ) .
rabbits were treated with vehicle ( saline ) or pdtc ( 20 mg / kg ) intravenously 0.5 h before the onset of i / r and therefore were divided into i / r and i / r + pdtc group accordingly .
we checked pdtc of 20 mg / kg and 40 mg / kg in our preliminary study and 20 mg / kg pdtc was proven to be safe and efficient .
rabbits in sham group underwent all the same surgical procedures except that the sutures , passing around the lcx , were not tied .
myocardial damage measurement myocardial damage was measured by using evan 's blue and thioflavin s staining methods as previously described [ 9 ] .
briefly , 1 ml / kg of thioflavin s ( 6 % , sigma ) was injected into the left atrium at the end of i / r procedure for the assessment of nr area .
thioflavin s is a specific endothelial fluorescent dye , by which fluorescent negative area of the heart was recognized as nr area .
1 min later , the lcx coronary artery was retied at the exact previous occlusion site followed by left atrium injection of 2 ml 4 % evan 's blue ( alfa aesar ) to measure the ischemic risk area ( aar ) .
the rabbits were then sacrificed using an overdose of sodium pentobarbital .
the heart was quickly removed , sliced into five transverse sections , weighted , observed and photographed under ultraviolet light ( 254 nm ) .
the left ventricular area ( lv ) , aar ( defined as not stained by the blue dye ) , non - ischemic area ( n , stained by the blue dye ) and nr area for all slices were calculated by computer - assisted planimetry using imagepro - plus software .
samples from three areas ( n , aar and nr ) of lv cardiac tissue were processed accordingly for subsequent analysis .
reagents antibodies for nf - kappab p65 and beta - actin were from santa cruz biotechnology ( santa cruz , ca ) ; antibody for p - nf - kappab p65 was from cell signaling technology ( beverly , ma ) .
pdtc was purchased from sigma .
cell culture human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) were obtained from sciencell research laboratories ( carlsbad , ca , usa ) and cultured in endothelial cell medium ( ecm ) supplemented with endothelial cell growth supplement ( ecgs ) , 5 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) and penicillin / streptomycin ( p / s ) solution ( sciencell , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
for experiments , cells of passage 4 - 6 were grown until confluence .
pdtc was added 1 h prior to the exposure of huvecs to normal condition or simulative i / r at the concentrations of 0.1 mm , 0.25 mm and 0.5 mm. typan blue staining confirmed no toxicity effects of pdtc in this setting .
huvecs i / r protocol simulative i / r was initiated by incubation of huvecs for 30 min in an " ischemic buffer " containing 118 mm nacl , 24 mm nahco3 , 1.0 mm nah2po4,2.5 mm cacl2 , 1.2 mm mgcl2 , 20 mm sodium lactate , 16 mm kcl , 10 mm 2 - deoxyglucose ( ph adjusted to 6.2 ) [ 7 ] , followed by " reperfusion " for 4 h .
" reperfusion " was accomplished by replacing the ischemic buffer with normal medium and culturing cells under normoxic condition .
in vitro sirna transfection pre - designed and validated sirna specific for nf - kappab p65 , and control non - targeting sirna were purchased from santa cruz ( sc - 29410 ) .
huvecs were plated to reach 30 - 50 % confluence on the day of transfection , and 20 nm sirna duplexes were introduced with lipofectamine rnaimax ( invitrogen ) .
real time rt - pcr the quantitatively rt - pcr method has been described by us previously [ 10 ] .
total rna was extracted from huvecs using the trizol reagent ( invitrogen ) , and quantitative reverse transcription pcr was performed using the iscript ( tm ) cdna synthesis kit ( bio - rad ) .
18s rrna served as an endogenous control .
we used a sybr premix ex taq ( takara ) and iq5 real - time pcr detection system ( biorad ) for real - time quantification .
primer sequences were 5 ' - cctggagcaggctatcagtc - 3 ' and 5 ' - atcttgagctcggcagtgtt - 3 ' for nf - kappab p65 , and 5 ' - cagaggttgaaccccacagt - 3 ' and 5 ' - cctctggcttcgtcagaatc - 3 ' for icam - 1 , 5 ' - cctgtgaggaggacgaacat - 3 ' and 5 ' - aggccccagtttgaattctt - 3 ' for tnf - alpha , 5 ' - ctcctggccatcatcttcat - 3 ' and 5 ' - aagcttccattcttggctca - 3 ' for cxcl16 , 5 ' - cggctaccacatccaaggaa - 3 ' and 5 ' - gctggaattaccgcggct - 3 ' for 18s rrna .
elisa blood samples were withdrawn from carotid artery of the rabbits at different time points ( i.e. 0 , 45 , 100 and 150 minutes after ischemia ) during the process of myocardial i / r. tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 serum levels were analyzed using rabbit elisa kits ( xitang biotechnology co. , ltd , shanghai , china ) according to manufacturers' instructions .
the culture media of huvecs with various treatments were also collected in in vitro study and subjected to human specific elisa kits ( quantikine ; r & d systems , minneapolis , mn ) to detect the supernatant levels of tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 by a microplate reader set to 450 nm. western blotting total huvecs lysates from cell culture were separated in 10 % sds - page and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride ( pdvf ) membrane ( millipore ) and analysed by western blotting as mentioned earlier [ 10 ] .
the isolation of nuclear and cytophasmic protein from rabbit heart tissue and huvecs was achieved by using ne - per nuclear and cytoplasmic extaction kit ( thermo scientific ) according to the manufacturers 's instructions .
immunohistochemistry heart samples were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin .
serial 5 - microm sections were incubated with antibodies against nf - kappab p65 ( sc - 8008 , 1:50 , santa cruz ) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin .
images were viewed and captured blindly by two observers using of a nikon labophot 2 microscope equipped with a sony ccd - iris / rgb colour video camera attached to a computerized imaging system and analyzed by imagepro plus 3.0 .
electron microscopy electron microscopy analysis was performed as described previously .
samples were taken from the centre part of nr area in sham , i / r and i / r + pdtc groups ( n = 3 for each group ) after myocardial i / r in the presence or absence of pdtc treatment 0.5 h ahead .
ultra - thin sections ( 1 mm3 ) were fixed for 30 min with ice - cold 2.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer , embedded in epon , and processed for transmission electron microscopy by standard procedures in a blinded fashion at x6,000 magnification .
myeloperoxidase measurement ( mpo ) mpo is an enzyme present in leukocytes and is a marker of leukocytes infiltration into myocardium .
an mpo enzyme immunosorbent assay kit ( jiancheng bioengineering institute , nanjing , china ) was used to determine mpo levels .
briefly , tissues from each area of the hearts were snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen until they were analyzed .
a 5 % ( wt / vol ) homogenate of each area of heart tissue in ice - cold pbs containing leupeptin ( 1 microg / ml ) , pepstatin a ( 1 microg / ml ) , and antipain ( 50 microg / ml ) was prepared and centrifuged , and the supernatants were used for assay of mpo activity according to the manufactory 's instructions and determined spectrophotometrically at 460 nm. statistical analysis the data were expressed as means +/ - sd. differences between the control and experimental groups were analyzed using strudent 's t - test .
the data from more than two groups were evaluated by one - way anova followed by the newman - keuls test .
p value < 0.05 is considered statistically significant .
results suppression of nf - kappab attenuates neutrophil infiltration in the nr area following i / r injury myocardial i / r was induced by ligation of the left circumflex coronary artery of new zealand white male rabbits for 1.5 h followed by reperfusion for 1 h. the non - ischemic ( n ) , area at risk ( aar ) , and nr areas were identified by thioflavin s ( a fluorescent dye specific for endothelial cells ) and evan 's blue staining to facilitate histological and biochemical investigations for each individual area .
the round , polymorphonuclear cells accumulated abundantly in strip - shape in the nr area of myocardial samples from i / r group , but absent in the normal myocardium ( sham group ) ( left panel , fig. 1a ) .
quantification of cell numbers in each field was performed by viewing , capturing the images and analyzing the images with imagepro plus 3.0. software .
the results revealed cell numbers in aar and nr area increased by 1.6 - fold ( p < 0.01 ) and 1.9 - fold ( p < 0.001 ) , respectively , compared to their counterparts in sham group ( right panel , fig. 1a ) .
immunohistochemical staining of p65 revealed that most of the nuclei of these intensively infiltrated round - shaped cells were p65 positive ( left panel , fig. 1b ) .
notably , striped gathering of polymorphonuclear cells was morphologically barely observed by pre - treatment of animals with pdtc , a specific nf - kappab inhibitor .
cell numbers in nr area were accordingly decreased by 43 % with pdtc treatment ( p < 0.05 ) ( right panel , fig. 1b ) .
to verify these accumulated polymorphonuclear cells were activated neutrophils , we measured myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) in each area of the hearts .
mpo is most abundantly presented in neutrophil granulocytes and released into extracellular space via degranulation after the activation of neutrophils .
thus , not only mpo serves as a marker for neutrophils but also its level stands for the function and activity of neutrophils .
our results demonstrated that myocardial mpo levels in n , aar and nr areas of i / r group were 1.3 - fold , 2.5 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) , and 6.5 - fold ( p < 0.01 ) of the sham group , respectively .
moreover , the mpo levels of n , aar and nr areas in i / r + pdtc group were reduced by 7 % , 41 % ( p < 0.05 ) , and 79 % ( p < 0.01 ) respectively , as compared to those in the i / r group ( fig. 1c ) .
taken together , our data demonstrate that active neutrophils accumulate in the nr area of hearts after i / r , and inhibition of nf - kappab with pdtc significantly reduces the sequestration and activity of neutrophils in this area .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0047306.g001 figure 1 myocardial i / r - induced infiltration of neutrophils in the nr area is attenuated by pdtc treatment .

results are expressed as mean +/ - sd. nf - kappab inhibition decreases serum tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 and ameliorates myocardial damage because cytokines recruit and activate neutrophil granulocytes during the process of inflammation , we then sought to determine whether and when proinflammatory cytokines were upregulated in the setting of nr and whether the upregulation was mediated by nf - kappab .
in the rabbits in which nr developed following myocardial i / r , serum levels of tnf - alpha and icam - 1 were markedly increased ( fig. 2 ) .
levels of tnf - alpha at i / r 100 min ( i.e. , 100 min after ischemia ) and 150 min were increased by 1.4 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) and 2.3 - fold ( p < 0.01 ) , respectively , as compared to i / r 0 min ( i.e. , time right before ischemia ) ( upper left panel , fig. 2a ) .
similarly , icam - 1 levels at i / r 100 min and 150 min were elevated by 1.4 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) and 1.7 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) , respectively , as compared to i / r 0 minute ( upper middle panel , fig. 2a ) .
pretreatment of rabbits with pdtc significantly suppressed i / r - induced elevations of tnf - alpha and icam - 1 by 42 % ( p < 0.05 ) and 38 % ( p < 0.05 ) , respectively , at i / r 150 minutes as compared to i / r group .
recently , cxcl16 , a new chemokine was identified and added to the growing family of chemokines .
serum cxcl16 level was upregulated at early phrase of reperfusion ( at i / r 100 minutes ) with a maximal induction of 1.7 - fold as compared to i / r 0 minute ( p < 0.05 ) ( upper right panel , fig. 2a ) .
in contrast , serum cxcl16 level was lower by 36 % when pdtc was used ( p < 0.05 , i / r + pdtc vs. i / r ) at the same time point .
the i / r - induced nr area was evaluated by thioflavin s staining ( fig. 2b ) , and demonstrated a 49 % reduction with pdtc treatment ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 2c ) .
the damage of reperfusion in nr area was revealed by h & e staining as the sections from nr area of i / r group exhibited severe interstitial edema and disarrangement of myocardial fibers in comparison with that of sham group ( fig. 2d ) .
furthermore , electron microscopy ( em ) detected the ultrastructural damages of cardiomyocytes such as detached and snapped myofibrils , intramitochondrial blebs and mitochondrial edema with loss of cristae in nr area of i / r group ( fig. 2e ) .
in contrast , all these damages displayed in nr area of i / r group were rescued in the same area of i / r + pdtc group .

nf - kappab inhibitor suppresses simulative i / r - induced expression of tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 to investigate the mechanisms underlying i / r injury - induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the repressor role of pdtc , we developed an in vitro simulative i / r culture system , in which cells were firstly treated with pdtc or vehicle for 1 h , then cultured in a well - defined " ischemic buffer " or normal medium ( control ) for 30 min , followed by switching to normal media for 4 h. then various inflammatory mediators were analyzed quantitatively with quantitative rt - pcr , western blotting , and elisa .
because endothelial cells play a pivotal role in preserving vascular integrity and are very sensitive to the changes of flow environment as the very inner layer of the vessel , we chose to use huvecs , which also appear to be one of the primary targets for i / r , for these studies .
simulative i / r treatment led to an increase in p65 mrna level by 2.19 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) .
pretreatment of cells with 0.1 mm , 0.25 mm and 0.5 mm of pdtc significantly decreased the i / r - induced p65 mrna expression by 72 % , 71 % and 78 % , respectively ( p < 0.01 ) ( left panel , fig. 3a ) .
accordingly , i / r induced p65 protein level by 3.81 - fold ( p < 0.01 ) , which was decreased by 0.5 mm pdtc by 49.6 % ( p < 0.05 ) as quantified by densitometry and normalized to the values of beta - actin ( loading control ) ( right panel , fig. 3a ) .
simulative i / r significantly increased the levels of cellular mrna and supernatant protein , respectively , by 1.77 - fold and 2.27 - fold for tnf - alpha ( p < 0.05 ) , 3.69 - fold ( p < 0.01 ) and 2.03 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) for icam - 1 , 1.92 - fold and 2.24 - fold for cxcl16 ( p < 0.01 ) , as compared to controls .
treatment of cells with 0.5 mm pdtc markedly decreased the simulative i / r - induced mrna level of tnf - alpha to a maximal extent by 77 % ( p < 0.01 ) and suppressed supernatant tnf - alpha level by 55 % ( p < 0.05 ) in a dose dependent manner ( with a maximal inhibition at 55 % , p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 3b ) .
similarly , mrna and protein levels of icam - 1 were significantly decreased by 78 % ( p < 0.01 ) and 44 % ( p < 0.05 ) , respectively , with 0.5 mm pdtc treatment ( fig. 3c ) .
consistently , 0.5 mm pdtc suppressed i / r - induced mrna and protein levels of cxcl16 to a maximal extent by 77 % ( p < 0.01 ) and 49 % ( p < 0.05 ) , respectively ( fig. 3d ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0047306.g003 figure 3 pdtc suppresses simulative i / r - induced mrna and protein levels of tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 in huvecs .
huvecs were treated with incremental concentrations of pdtc for 1 h , then cultured in normal culture media ( control ) or in " ischemic buffer " for 30 min , followed by switching to normal media for 4 h ( i.e. , simulative i / r ) .
then , quantitative rt - pcr ( left panel ) and western blotting ( right panel ) were performed first to check the mrna and protein levels of inflammatory markers p65 ( a ) , followed by quantitative rt - pcr and elisa to quantify cellular mrna expression ( left panels ) and supernatant protein levels ( right panels ) , respectively , of tnf - alpha ( b ) , icam - 1 ( c ) and cxcl16 ( d ) .
beta - actin was used as a loading control .
densitometry values for p65 are expressed as fold change compared with control values normalized to 1 .
the results were obtained from three independent experiments carried out in duplicates and expressed as fold changes relative to the levels in control cells cultured in normal culture media .
data are presented as mean +/ - sd .

transfection of the cells with p65 sirna decreased p65 mrna level by 73 % ( p < 0.05 ) as compared to transfection with control non - targeting sirna ( left panel , fig. 4a ) .
western blotting further confirmed the inhibitory effect of p65 sirna on protein level .
transfection of 20 nm p65 sirna under i / r condition reduced the protein level of p65 by 75.2 % ( p < 0.01 ) ( right panel , fig. 4a ) .
consequently , p65 sirna transfection decreased i / r - induced mrna and protein levels of tnf - alpha by 48 % and 61 % , respectively ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 4b ) , which was associated with a reduction in the mrna and protein levels of icam - 1 ( by 44 % and 72 % , p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 4c ) and cxcl16 ( by 42 % and 64 % , p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 4d ) , respectively .
collectively , our data indicate that both nf - kappab inhibitor ptdc and p65 knockdown significantly suppress simulative i / r - induced inflammatory cytokines tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 and that nf - kappab may play a central role in the inflammatory response to i / r injury .

i / r promoted the activity of nf - kappab in nr area of rabbit myocardium and huvecs nuclear translocation of p65 was determined by western blotting to confirm the activation of p65 after i / r. for in vivo study , nuclear protein of p65 in nr area from i / r group was dramatically elevated compared to sham group , which was quenched in i / r + pdtc group ( fig. 5a ) .
we then sought to explore whether in vitro simulative i / r also activated p65 in huvecs .
cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates of huvecs were subjected to immunoblotting of p65 to determine nuclear translocation under control or simulative i / r circumstances .
the results showed that simulative i / r indeed boosted the translocation of p65 into nuclei of huvecs ( fig. 5b ) .
i / r resulted in the increase of p65 protein level , which occurred within 4 h of reperfusion and persisted for at least 24 h. in accord with it , a reperfusion time - dependent activation of p65 , as measured by phosphorylation at ser536 , was also observed in huvecs after " ischemia " for 30 min ( fig. 5c ) .

( b ) huvecs underwent simulative i / r for 4 h , then cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of which were assessed by western blotting for p65 .
( c ) huvecs exposed to normal culture media ( control ) or 30 min of " ischemic buffer " followed by switching to normal media for 4 h , 18 h and 24 h. cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot for p - p65 ( ser536 ) and p65 .
beta - actin served as internal control .
discussion nr phenomenon refers to that compromised microcirculation does not allow normal myocardial blood flow despite the removal of the coronary obstruction [ 11 ]. with the development of reperfusion strategies , it becomes more important to reduce the incidence of nr for a better clinic outcome .
myocardial i / r induces inflammatory response that contributes to nr , whereas the underlying mechanism remains unclear .
the present study demonstrates that nf - kappab , as a quick stress - reactive transcription factor , promotes the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and mediates the recruitment of neutrophils in the nr area to precipitate dysfunction of microcirculation in vivo .
furthermore , our in vitro studies confirm that nf - kappab mediates the simulative i / r - induced upregulation of tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 .
infiltration of neutrophils is a common feature of acute inflammatory reactions .
it has been well established that infiltrated leukocytes are important mediators of cardiac i / r injury [ 12 ] - [ 13 ] .
various approaches used to inhibit neutrophils after myocardial i / r , such as depletion of neutrophils by specific filters and inhibition of adhesion molecules by selective antibodies , can reduce i / r damage [ 14 ] .
accumulation of activated neutrophils in i / r myocardium contributes to nr both by physically occluding microvessels as shown by engler et al .
[ 15 ] in dogs and by acting as a source of oxygen radicals which lead to severe cell damages and myocardial nr. in this study , we have provided direct evidence for the existence of neutrophil accumulation in the nr area of rabbit i / r myocardium .
we verified that these accumulated cells are positive for p65 and express a high level of mpo .
in addition , the amount and function of neutrophils in the nr area are significantly greater than that in n and aar areas , as indicated by mpo levels .
these results clearly reflect a higher level of inflammation in the nr area than in n and aar areas .
pdtc markedly suppressed the accumulation of neutrophils in the nr area of the heart , which suggest that nf - kappab likely mediates this prominent inflammation .
frantz et al. reported that deletion of nf - kappab subunit p50 reduces i / r injury , which is associated with less neutrophil infiltration [ 16 ] .
consistently , in our study , application of pdtc reduces the amount of the infiltrated neutrophils in the nr area along with a decrease in the degree of nr , which further suggests that nf - kappab is , in fact , involved the mechanism of i / r - induced nr by aggregating inflammation characteristic of neutrolphil accumulation .
another possible mechanism for neutrophils to promote nr is to adhere to and cross endothelia and clog capillaries [ 17 ] .
chemotactic agents and adhesion molecules play essential roles in inflammation by promoting the accumulation of activated neutrophils .
cytokine tnf - alpha is known for their potent ability to attract leukocytes to inflammatory sites .
our results showed an increase in tnf - alpha serum protein expression after i / r , which is consistent with the observation made by gao et al [ 18 ] .
adhesion molecule icam - 1 is a primary determinant of polymorphonuclear neutrophil recruitment by facilitating transmigration of leukocytes across vascular endothelia to exert inflammatory effects .
studies carried out in icam - 1 deficient mice ( icam1 - / - ) [ 19 ] or animals receiving antibodies against icam - 1 [ 20 ] have clearly demonstrated a reduction in myocardial necrosis and neutrophils infiltration after i / r. consistently , serum levels of icam - 1 in rabbits were induced after the initiation of ischemia and uproar after reperfusion in our study .
intriguingly , we found cxcl16 , a small cytokine belonging to the cxc chemokine family , reacted to myocardial i / r even more quickly than tnf - alpha and icam - 1 and peaked right after the initiation of reperfusion .
cxcl16 is a trans - membrane cytokine that exists in both a membrane bound and soluble form .
membrane bound cxcl16 can not only act as a scavenger receptor for oxidized low - density lipoproteins to facilitate cell adhesion [ 21 ] but also can act as an adhesion molecule for leukocytes expressing cxcr6 , the sole receptor for cxcl16 .
more importantly , surface expressed cxcl16 can be cleaved by proteases of the adam family to release as a soluble form [ 22 ] and thereby serves as a chemo - attractant for cxcr6 + cells .
consequently , the shed chemokine domain of cxcl16 simply forms of a chemotactic gradient for leukocytes expressing cxcr6 to recruit neutrophils [ 23 ] .
accumulating evidences have shown that cxcl16 is a marker of inflammation , atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome in humans [ 24 ] .
given the unique properties of cxcl16 and the data from our study , it is reasonable to propose that cxcl16 may be involved in the inflammatory response of nr by directly promoting the migration of leukocytes to nr area , the very site of violent inflammation .
the elevation of tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 during reperfusion were suppressed by pdtc , which confirms that nf - kappab mediates the increase of these proinflammatory cytokines .
meanwhile , application of pdtc tremendously rescued i / r induced cardiac damages as measured by gross nr extent and ultrastructural lesions .
nf - kappab was known to be involved in myocardial i / r injury based on the fact that employment of ikk [ 8 ] and proteasome inhibition [ 25 ] or overexpression of inhibitory ikb protein to suppress nf - kappab in animals attenuated myocardial i / r injury .
similar clinic benefit was also observed in patients subjected to cardioplegic arrest on cardiopulmonary bypass received antioxidants to suppress nf - kappab expression [ 26 ] .
however , little information is known about the effects of nf - kappab blockade on nr. our study reveals that suppression of nf - kappab contributed to amelioration of anatomic nr by decline of the neutrophils infiltration in nr area as well as the expression of proinflammatory factors .
further study such as measuring the change of actual blood perfusion might be needed to confirm the effect of pdtc treatment on nr phenomenon .
nf - kappab is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates the expression of immediate - early and stress response genes following a variety of stimuli , many of which are implicated in acute inflammatory responses .
activated nf - kappab induces upregulation of tnf - alpha resulting in i / r injury such as the secretion of inflammatory media , decrease of myocardial contractility , and induction of cardiomyocytes apoptosis [ 27 ] .
it is well known that cardiac i / r injury is one of the main mechanisms of nr. to explore the mechanism of i / r - associated nr in vitro , we investigated huvecs in the well - established simulative i / r model .
our results confirm that i / r is associated with a systemically increased release of inflammatory cytokines regulated by nf - kappab .
indeed , analogous to the findings in rabbit nr model , we observed the increase in tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 mrna and protein levels in huvecs after simulative i / r. furthermore , suppression of nf - kappab by administration of pdtc or p65 sirna prior to simulative i / r treatment significantly attenuated the expression of tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16. of great interest was cxcl16 mrna expression that was also stimulated by i / r and associated with an accumulation of the secreted cxcl16 protein in the cell culture supernatants , which suggest a role of this cytokine in the inflammatory process .
these results are in agreement with a previous study in which stimulation of endothelial cells with tnf - alpha and ifn - gamma leads to the induction of cxcl16 expression [ 22 ] .
because tnf - alpha is induced by nf - kappab very quickly following i / r and therefore may be assumed to function as one of the initiators of a cytokine cascade and dominate the upregulation of cxcl16 .
surprisingly , we observed that serum cxcl16 responded to i / r more quickly to i / r than tnf - alpha. whether the decrease in cxcl16 level upon suppression of nf - kappab is a direct or indirect effect remains to be elucidated .
further investigations are needed to pinpoint the precise mechanism underlying cxcl16 regulation and provide more insights into the role of this novel chemokine in inflammation associated nr. in addition , not only the mrna and protein levels of nf - kappab p65 but also its activity as indicated by nuclear translocation and phosphorylation at ser536 was promoted by i / r in our study .
it is known that ikk phosphorylation to free p65 is one of the mechanisms for p65 activation .
in this case , we can not yet reach the conclusion that i / r - induced increase of p65 mrna / protein level is the only mechanism for the upregulation of tnf - alpha / icam - 1 / cxcl16 .
in summary , by promoting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tnf - alpha , icam - 1 and cxcl16 as well as recruiting neutrophils , nf - kappab aggravates inflammatory response and contributes to nr in the setting of myocardial i / r. these findings provide a better understanding of the effects of nf - kappab on inflammatory response of i / r - associated nr in the heart .
therefore , inhibition of nf - kappab might be a promising approach to prevent nr in patient with ami underwent reperfusion .

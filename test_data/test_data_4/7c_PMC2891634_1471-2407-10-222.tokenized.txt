background the distinction between primary and secondary ovarian tumors may be challenging for pathologists .
the purpose of the present work was to develop genomic and transcriptomic tools to further refine the pathological diagnosis of ovarian tumors after a previous history of breast cancer .
methods sixteen paired breast - ovary tumors from patients with a former diagnosis of breast cancer were collected .
the genomic profiles of paired tumors were analyzed using the affymetrix genechip ( r ) mapping 50 k xba array or genome - wide human snp array 6.0 ( for one pair ) , and the data were normalized with italics ( iterative and alternative normalization and copy number calling for affymetrix snp arrays ) algorithm or partek genomic suite , respectively .
the transcriptome of paired samples was analyzed using affymetrix genechip ( r ) human genome u133 plus 2.0 arrays , and the data were normalized with gc - robust multi - array average ( gcrma ) algorithm .
a hierarchical clustering of these samples was performed , combined with a dataset of well - identified primary and secondary ovarian tumors .
results in 12 of the 16 paired tumors analyzed , the comparison of genomic profiles confirmed the pathological diagnosis of primary ovarian tumor ( n = 5 ) or metastasis of breast cancer ( n = 7 ) .
among four cases with uncertain pathological diagnosis , genomic profiles were clearly distinct between the ovarian and breast tumors in two pairs , thus indicating primary ovarian carcinomas , and showed common patterns in the two others , indicating metastases from breast cancer .
in all pairs , the result of the transcriptomic analysis was concordant with that of the genomic analysis .
conclusions in patients with ovarian carcinoma and a previous history of breast cancer , snp array analysis can be used to distinguish primary and secondary ovarian tumors .
transcriptomic analysis may be used when primary breast tissue specimen is not available .
background malignant ovarian tumors comprise a wide and heterogeneous collection of primary and secondary tumors .
in patients who had previously developed a breast cancer , the differential diagnosis between primary ovarian carcinoma and metastases from breast cancer may be sometimes challenging , while it is mandatory to ensure the optimal care for patients .
indeed , metastatic spread and biological pattern differ between metastatic breast cancer and primary ovarian carcinoma .
metastatic breast cancer assessment requires whole body ct - scan , bone scan , and ca 15 - 3 measurement .
primary ovarian carcinoma assessment requires extensive intra - abdominal exploration and ca - 125 measurement .
moreover , the prognosis of metastatic breast cancer and primary ovarian carcinoma widely differs , with a median progression - free survival ranging from 20 to 40 months , and from 9 to 30 months , respectively [ 1,2 ] .
most importantly , therapeutic options are very different .
usual therapies for advanced breast cancer may combine or alternate hormonotherapy , chemotherapy regimens , and targeted therapies according to the tumor profile .
conversely , medical therapeutic options for ovarian cancer are scarce , based on paclitaxel - carboplatin combination .
other drugs have been shown to provide minor benefits to the patients , and targeted therapies are only entering early clinical trials .
surgery is required to provide a thorough exploration of the abdominal cavity , to remove malignant ovarian lesions , to obtain a diagnosis , which is crucial for prognosis , and to plan adequate treatment [ 3 ] .
in surgical series , ovarian metastases from other primary cancers represent 5 % to 20 % of all ovarian cancers [ 3 - 5 ] .
metastatic lesions to the ovaries are more commonly seen from primary colon cancer , appendiceal , and breast carcinomas .
however , there are few clinical or pathological features that make possible to arrive at a differential diagnosis between primary and secondary tumors [ 6,7 ] .
brca1 and brca2 mutation carriers have an increased risk of primary breast and ovarian tumors [ 8 ] , whereas patients with an infiltrating lobular carcinoma ( ilc ) of the breast are more likely to develop secondary ovarian metastases [ 9,10 ] .
to date , pathological examination remains the cornerstone of the differential diagnosis between primary ovarian tumor and ovarian metastases .
in case of metastatic lesions , the involvement of ovaries is more often bilateral , and associated with ascites [ 3 - 5 ] .
in those tumors , the pathological feature is more often a stromal rather than a serous invasion , suggesting a metastatic diffusion through blood and lymphatic vessels [ 5 ] .
in that case , the differential diagnosis is of paramount importance .
several approaches have been developed to discriminate between primary and secondary ovarian cancers .
among them , immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) has evaluated diagnostic markers , presumably able to support the diagnosis , such as pax8 , a transcription factor for organogenesis of mullerian system , or wilms tumor suppressor gene ( wt1 ) whose expression is regulated by pax8 [ 11,12 ] .
however , only limited series , without validation data , have been reported so far .
we speculate that genomic analysis may represent an alternative approach , which could also add some robustness to pax8 ihc data .
to our knowledge , only one study has evaluated high throughput genomic analyses to refine the diagnosis of ovarian lesions following an adenocarcinoma of the endometrium [ 13 ] .
in a series of nine patients , using 19 k comparative genomic hybridization ( cgh ) arrays , the authors established that , in three cases out of nine for which the pathological diagnosis was equivocal , the genomic analyses were able to provide a clear diagnosis .
in this series , no transcriptomic data were reported .
in the present work , we proposed to develop genomic and transcriptomic approaches to discriminate between primary and secondary ovarian tumors after breast cancer when the pathological diagnosis was equivocal .
for this purpose , we characterized genomic and transcriptomic profiles in paired breast and ovarian tumors diagnosed in a same patient , and compared genomic data with clinical and pathological characteristics .
methods clinical cases and data sixteen patients who had developed an infiltrating breast carcinoma and a subsequent ovarian tumor , and for whom frozen tissues were available for both tumors were included in the study .
breast tumors were classified according to the american joint committee on cancer ( ajcc )/ union internationale contre le cancer ( uicc ) staging system and usual pathological parameters [ 14 ] .
ovarian tumors were classified according to the federation internationale de gynecologie obstetrique ( figo ) staging system .
information about surgical and systemic treatments , and the occurrence of other metastatic sites were collected .
the clinical data were reviewed by two medical oncologists ( phc , lm ) .
pathological data were blindly reviewed by two pathologists ( nw , xsg ) , and , in case of discrepancy , a consensus was achieved .
to ensure an independent data extraction , all procedures were conducted separately by reviewers , and samples were analyzed without knowledge of their supposed status ( i.e. primary tumor , or metastasis ) .
this study was approved by the institutional review board and ethics committee .
patients were informed that their biological samples could be used for research purposes and that they had the right to refuse if they so wished .
immunohistochemical analysis immunohistochemical analysis was performed on formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tissue sections ( depth : 3 mum ) .
the samples were deparaffinized and pretreated in edta buffer at ph 9 ( 40 minutes at 97degreesc ) , and then hydrated in pbs solution for 5 minutes .
then , the rabbit polyclonal anti - pax8 antibody ( protein tech group inc. , chicago , il , usa ) was applied ( dilution : 1 / 200 ) , and samples were incubated overnight at 4degreesc .
the endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with hydrogen peroxide .
a second antibody directed against the primary anti - pax8 antibody and coupled with a peroxidase polymer envision + ( dako , trappes , france ) was applied for 30 minutes .
then , the peroxidase was revealed during a 10 - minute incubation with a di - aminobenzidine solution ( dab dako k3468 ) .
finally , samples were counterstained with haematoxylin ( 2 minutes ) , and mounted with permanent media .
dna and rna extraction and preparation for microarray experiment tumor dna and rna were provided by the biological resource center of the institut curie .
prior to dna and rna isolation , a tissue section of tumor fragments was performed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate tumor cellularity .
all analyzed tumors had more than 50 % of tumoral cells on the tissue section .
the dna was extracted from frozen tumor samples using a standard phenol / chloroform procedure .
the total rna was isolated using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , cergy - pontoise , france ) in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions .
the concentration of rna was measured by absorbance at 260 nm. the quality of each rna sample was determined with agilent 2100 bioanalyzer .
rnas were processed on chips only if the following criteria were fulfilled : rin ( a measure of rna quality ) >= 7.6 , ( 28s / 18s ) >= 1.8 , ( 260 nm / 230 nm ) >= 1.8 , and ( 260 nm / 280 nm ) >= 1.8 .
targets were prepared according to affymetrix ( affymetrix inc. , santa clara , ca , usa ) one cycle synthesis protocol , starting from 2 mug of total rna .
targets were hybridized to genechip ( r ) human genome u133 plus 2.0 arrays if yield and size of targets were reached .
twenty micrograms of complementary rna , with a specific size distribution were used to hybridize genechip ( r ) human genome u133 plus 2.0 array .
regarding dna , the quality was assessed on agarose gel , if a smear was observed instead of a band , the sample was discarded .
a 250 - ng genomic dna was used to generate targets according to the genechip ( r ) mapping 50 k xba protocol or genome - wide human snp array 6.0 protocol .
targets were prepared if 45 mug of amplified dna were available and if their size was between 250 and 2,000 bp , and hybridized according to manufacturer 's recommendations .
50 k snp array and snp6.0 array data analysis intensity signals data from genechip ( r ) human mapping 50 k xba array or genome - wide human snp array 6.0 were normalized and analyzed using italics ( iterative and alternative normalization and copy number calling for affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism [ snp ] arrays ) algorithm [ 15 ] or partek genomic suite ( partek inc. , st louis , mo , usa ) , respectively .
the detection and determination of genomics events ( gains , losses , amplifications and breakpoints ) was performed using glad ( gain and loss analysis of dna ) software [ 16 ] for genechip ( r ) human mapping 50 k xba array , and genomic segmentation algorithm of partek genomic suite for genome - wide human snp array 6.0 .
single nucleotide polymorphisms with smoothing value lower and greater than 2 +/ - 0.28 were considered as loss and gain , respectively .
the profiles were visualized with the vamp software [ 17 ] or partek genomic suite .
gene expression data analysis a series of 89 ovarian primary tumors and 36 ovarian metastases from breast cancer with a clear pathological diagnosis was used to establish a reference hierarchical tree .
all these samples were provided by the resource biological center of the institut curie and the chips were processed and hybridized in our laboratory ( department of translational research ) .
the dataset is publicly available on geo http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / geo / under accession number gse20565 .
rnas were prepared according to the manufacturer 's instructions , and were hybridized onto affymetrix genechip ( r ) human genome u133 plus 2.0 arrays .
transcriptomic data were normalized with gc - robust multi - array average ( gcrma ) algorithm [ 18 ] , using partek genomic suite ( partek inc. , st louis , mo , usa ) .
unsupervised hierarchical clustering of tumor samples was done using partek genomic suite software with standard pearson 's correlation as similarity measure , and ward 's method as linkage criteria .
the iqr ( a measure of the dispersion of each probe set intensity value across all samples ) was set in order to have 2 000 probe sets .
first , the clustering was performed on this set of reference samples ( 89 primary tumors and 36 ovarian metastases ) , then the 16 ovarian samples with ambiguous diagnosis were introduced in the dataset and the clustering was performed .
clustering validation of the reference hierarchical tree was performed using r environment and the clusterstab package [ 19 ] .
this package assessed the number of reliable clusters and the stability of the hierarchical clustering with a re - sampling approach whereby randomly selected subsets of samples ( 70 % each round ) are repeatedly clustered .
the extent of similarity between the resulting clusters was examined and measured by the jaccard coefficient ranging from zero ( no similarity ) to one ( identical clustering ) .
we used this strategy for a number of clusters ranging from 2 to 8 , and we compared the results of jaccard distribution .
enrichment of values equal or close to one indicated adequate choices of metric , agglomeration method and number of clusters .
the algorithm was run with the commonly used metrics ( euclidean and pearson correlation ) , and the commonly used agglomeration methods ( average and ward 's method ) .
the script of the function was adapted in order to use the pearson correlation coefficient as metric ( not implemented in the bioconductor package ) .
we used the hmisc package from bioconductor to calculate this correlation between samples .
the use of clusterstab package showed that the best reliability of the number of clusters was detected when using pearson correlation coefficient as metric , ward 's method as agglomeration method , and k = 2 clusters ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 distributions of jaccard coefficients , for a number of clusters ranging from k = 2 to k = 8 , derived from 100 independent random samplings of tumors .
distributions were presented only if pearson correlation coefficient and ward 's method were used .
the proportion of samples used for re - sampling was 0.7 .
for k = 2 clusters , the largest proportion of values near one indicated that tumors set up two stable clusters .
results patient and tumor characteristics the main characteristics of the sixteen patients and their tumors are summarized in table 1 .
the median age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 48 years ( range , 32 to 69 years ) , and at diagnosis of ovarian tumor was 54 years ( range , 38 to 71 years ) .
the median time interval between breast cancer and ovarian tumor diagnosis was 73 months ( range , 0 to 150 months ) .
one patient had an ipsilateral breast relapse contemporaneous to the ovarian tumor ( case # 2 ) .
all patients had a breast surgery plus axillary dissection .
only two patients did not receive any systemic therapy .
other patients received a systemic treatment consisting of adjuvant chemotherapy , tamoxifen alone or chemoendocrine therapy according to institutional guidelines .
all patients were irradiated according to our institutional guidelines .
at a median follow - up of 39 months after the diagnosis of ovarian tumor ( range , 1 to 87 months ) , five patients were still alive , among whom four had no evidence of disease .
the median overall survival from breast cancer diagnosis was 78 months , and 29 months from ovarian tumor diagnosis .

the pathological features of breast and ovarian tumors are presented in table 2 .
for breast tumors , the expression of her2 was assessed ( data not shown ) as negative in five patients , and was not available for the eleven remaining patients .
her2 is a marker of aggressiveness , the overexpression of her2 gene increases the cellular growth and metastatic potentialities .
for cases number 6 , 11 , 15 and 16 , the clinical and pathological analyses were not able to draw a definite conclusion regarding the ovarian tumor diagnosis ( table 3 ) due to the unspecific clinical presentation ( i.e. : ovarian carcinoma ) or pathological presentation ( poorly differentiated carcinoma which could be compatible with either primary or secondary ovarian tumor ) .
noteworthy , three of these four patients developed previously a non - lobular breast carcinoma ( infiltrating ductal carcinoma in two , undifferentiated in one ) .
no anti - pax8 staining was observed in primary breast carcinoma ( data not shown ) .
for the sixteen ovarian tumors , pax8 was deemed positive in six cases , and negative in ten cases .
based on clinical and pathological characteristics , two patients were treated as metastatic breast cancer , and two as primary ovarian cancer .

snp array analysis in four cases out of sixteen ovarian tumors , the pathological diagnosis was uncertain ( table 3 ) .
the comparison of mammary and ovarian genomic profiles was first established in the twelve available pairs with a clear diagnosis .
in the subset of seven metastatic samples , one array was not usable for analysis ( signal intensity too noisy on the chip ) .
among the six remaining samples , similar genetic events were found in mammary and ovarian tumors .
the alterations found in breast samples were observed in ovarian samples , whereas some additional alterations were observed in the ovarian samples as visually depicted in figure 2 .
moreover , the breakpoints detected in the mammary tumor were also found at the same position in the ovarian sample .
additional breakpoints were also found in this subset of ovarian tumors .
these observations led to the conclusions that these six ovarian tumors were metastases of the primary breast cancer .

( b ) histological sections of breast ( upper ) and ovarian ( lower ) tumors in the other subset of five samples considered as primary ovarian carcinoma , no overlap of genomic alterations was found between mammary and ovarian samples ( figure 3 ) .
as well , no common position for breakpoints was observed , thus confirming the primary status of the ovarian tumors ( table 3 ) .

( b ) histological sections of breast ( upper ) and ovarian ( lower ) tumors then , molecular diagnosis was performed on the four ambiguous tumors .
two of them were classified as metastases from breast cancer as similar genetic events were observed in the primary tumor and its ovarian counterpart ( see additional files 1 and 2 ) .
the two remaining tumors were classified as primary tumors as their genetic profiles were strikingly different from those of the original breast tumors ( see table 3 and additional files 3 and 4 ) .
transcriptomic analysis fifteen out of sixteen gene expression profiles of ovarian tumors were obtained .
these tumors were included in a set of samples including well - identified primary ovarian tumors ( n = 89 ) , and ovarian metastases ( n = 36 ) .
all the samples were processed , normalized , and clusterized as described above .
therefore , a hierarchical tree with two main branches was obtained : the first branch gathered all metastatic samples , and the second branch contained all primary tumors but one ( figure 4 ) .
the reference hierarchical tree obtained with the 125 reference tumors was not modified when the fifteen studied tumors were added .
two main branches were repeatedly generated with the raising of the tree from 125 to 140 tumors .
the fifteen ovarian tumors of the core subset all segregated accordingly to the pathological diagnosis and their genomic profiles ( figure 4 , table 3 ) .
the tumor # 1 , with no snp array data , clearly segregated with metastatic tumors .
figure 4 hierarchical clustering .
pearson 's correlation coefficient and ward 's method were used .
in red are the ovarian metastases samples , and in blue the ovarian primary tumors .
red and blue arrows localized the ovarian metastases and primary tumor samples , respectively , among the 16 cases included in this study discussion so far , no definitive molecular profiling of ovarian cancer has been published .
molecular characterization is only based on grade , histo - pathological features and some key genes alterations .
as well , no high - throughput molecular data on ovarian metastasis have been reported .
this study is the first to use a comprehensive genomic analysis to discriminate primary ovarian carcinomas and metastatic ovarian lesions from breast cancer .
a similar approach was evaluated to distinguish primary from secondary ovarian tumors after adenocarcinoma of the endometrium [ 13 ] .
using a 19 k cgh array , four cases out of nine remained undetermined .
in our data set , the pathological status of ovarian lesions was well established in twelve cases .
the blind test of these pairs for snp and transcriptomic analyses was in agreement with the pathological analysis ( table 3 ) .
in the four lesions with an ambiguous pathological diagnosis , snp and transcriptomic analyses permitted to clearly discriminate primary tumor and metastatic disease .
this is also the first time that both transcriptomic and genomic analyses were performed , demonstrating a complete overlap of results with these two kinds of analyses .
the purpose of the present work was not to provide a genomic signature , but to give a diagnosis allowing a treatment decision .
conversely to the study of ovarian tumors after adenocarcinoma of the endometrium using low - density 19 k bac arrays [ 13 ] , we used high - density 50 k snp arrays , showing major chromosomal alterations in all tumors .
this method allowed interpretation and comparison of the genomic profiles within the fifteen available pairs of breast and ovarian tumors .
when most of genomic alterations found in primary breast tumors were included in the ovarian counterpart , a genomic diagnosis of metastases was proposed and then confirmed by the comparison with the histopathological diagnosis .
a previous experience of cgh in metastatic breast cancer has been reported , comparing primary tumor with lymph node metastases , distant metastases or local recurrences in sixteen patients [ 20 ] .
genomic profiles comparison showed that additional aberrations were detected in the lymph nodes or distant metastases when compared to the primary tumors .
these findings suggest that progression from primary breast cancer to metastasis may be associated with the acquisition of further genetic changes .
overall , in the present series , we confirmed these findings and proposed the use of snp array technology to provide a definite diagnosis in case of equivocal ovarian lesions .
furthermore , the present study highlighted that the transcriptomic analysis was always in concordance with the pathological diagnosis in the reference set of well - identified 125 tumors , excepted for one case considered as a metastasis , but clustering with primary tumors ( figure 4 ) .
both analyses ( genomic and transcriptomic ) were possible in fourteen pairs of tumors , and results were always identical ( table 3 ) .
given the robustness of our reference tree , we have therefore established a dataset of reference that is now available for future research and diagnostic purposes .
the main interest of this method is to have at one 's disposal a test that does not require the primary tumor to give a diagnosis .
indeed , other authors have reported a similar approach in particular with carcinomas of unknown primary ( cup ) [ 21 ] , suggesting that expression data may help in elucidating the histogenetic origin of metastatic tissue .
the future directions might be to enrich our dataset of tumors likely to give ovarian metastases , such as gastric or colorectal carcinomas .
the use of wt1 in ihc analysis seems not to be appropriate to discriminate between primary and secondary tumors .
a recent study [ 22 ] showed that wt1 is rather dedicated to distinguish between serous and endometrioids ovarian carcinomas .
so , in our study , we preferred to use pax8 staining instead of wt1 staining for the distinction of primary and secondary lesions .
interestingly , pax8 ihc status was in concordance with genomic results in the present model of primary ovarian tumors compared to ovarian metastases from breast cancer , except for one patient who had a clear - cell carcinoma .
pax8 is usually highly , but not always , expressed in serous - papillary ( 96,4 %) , endometrioid ( 88,9 %) or clear - cell carcinoma ( 100 %) [ 11 ] .
in the series of these authors , pax8 staining was positive for all the clear - cell carcinoma ( 10 / 10 ) , so they concluded that pax8 was particularly useful for the diagnosis of this histotype .
but the only one sample which is not stained in our collection is a clear - cell ovarian carcinoma .
moreover , no definite nor consensual criteria for pax8 ihc positivity has been defined so far , yielding some concern about the reproducibility of their technique .
to our opinion , pax8 ihc does not provide a totally robust result concerning the status of ovarian tumors .
in the present series , genomic analyses yielded a definite diagnosis in all cases .
in another study concerning mouse model of human ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma [ 23 ] , the authors performed ihc and sequence analysis , in parallel , on some genes implicated in the pathology .
for ctnnb1 gene , the results were totally concordant between ihc and sequence analyses .
but for other genes , like pten and tp53 , there were some discrepancies .
for example , 12 samples were found to be mutated with ihc for pten whereas when the authors examined the sequence , mutations were found only in 6 samples .
in this case , they detected 6 false positives with ihc analysis .
also , when they analyzed tp53 mutations , they detected 3 false positives and 2 false negatives between ihc and sequence analyses .
these results demonstrate that genomic tools are more appropriate to determine definitively the mutational status of genes .
conclusions we established the robustness of snp and transcriptomic analysis to discriminate primary ovarian tumors and ovarian metastases after primary breast cancer .
noteworthy , all genomic analyses were blindly compared to clinical and pathological characteristics .
an algorithm of diagnosis could be considered in the light of these results ( figure 5 ) .
the first step remains the pathological analysis .
if the primary tumor is not available , which represents the majority of cases , a transcriptomic analysis may be performed .
if the primary tumor is available , the snp array is the preferential test. of course , these results require further analyses and comparison with other biomarkers .
figure 5 proposed diagnostic algorithm of ovarian tumors in patients with a previous history of breast cancer .
if the mammary tumor of the patient is available , it is possible to perform a comparison between genomic profile of breast and ovary .
otherwise , if only the ovary tumor is available , a transcriptomic analysis is performed , and the sample is inserted into the reference hierarchical tree .

the genomic profiles of this pair were performed using affymetrix genechip ( r ) mapping 50 k xba array .
the normalization and segmentation methods used for this kind of array were those described in materials and methods .
few alterations were detected in the breast and the ovary samples .
in the zoomed area , we see that an alteration and breakpoints ( red vertical lines ) are detected at the same positions in the 2 samples , indicating that the ovary tumor is a metastasis from the breast .
yellow = normal ; red = gain ; green = loss ; blue = amplification .
x axis : all chromosomes , y axis : snp copy number .

the genomic profiles of this pair were performed using affymetrix genechip ( r ) mapping 50 k xba array .
the normalization and segmentation methods used for this kind of array were those described in materials and methods .
in the zoomed area , we observe that common alterations are found between the breast and the ovary tumors .
moreover , breakpoints ( red vertical lines ) are detected exactly at the same positions between the 2 samples .
so , in that case , the ovary tumor is a metastasis from the breast .
yellow = normal ; red = gain ; green = loss ; blue = amplification .
x axis : all chromosomes , y axis : snp copy number .

the genomic profiles of this pair were performed using affymetrix genome - wide human snp array 6.0 array .
the normalization and segmentation methods used for this kind of array were those described in materials and methods .
only the first 6 chromosomes are shown but they are representatives of all the alteration profiles observed on the 2 samples .
in each chromosome graph , the 2 top profiles represent the chromosomal copy number , the 2 bottom graphs represent the result of genomic segmentation algorithm : red area = gain , blue area = loss .
we can observe that no common alterations are detected between the breast and the ovary samples , indicating that the breast and the ovary tumors are both primary tumors .

the genomic profiles of this pair were performed using affymetrix genechip ( r ) mapping 50 k xba array .
the normalization and segmentation methods used for this kind of array were those described in materials and methods .
along the chromosomes and in the zoomed area , no common alteration or breakpoint ( red vertical lines ) position is detected between the breast and the ovary tumors .
this result reveals that the ovary tumor is a primary tumor and not a metastasis from the breast .
yellow = normal ; red = gain ; green = loss ; blue = amplification .
x axis : all chromosomes , y axis : snp copy number .

background measurements of anti - malarial antibodies are increasingly used as a proxy of transmission intensity .
most serological surveys are based on the use of cross - sectional data that , when age - stratified , approximates historical patterns of transmission within a population .
comparatively few studies leverage longitudinal data to explicitly relate individual infection events with subsequent antibody responses .
methods the occurrence of seroconversion and seroreversion events for two plasmodium falciparum asexual stage antigens ( msp - 1 and ama - 1 ) was examined using three annual measurements of 691 individuals from a cohort of individuals in a malaria - endemic area of rural east - central tanzania .
mixed - effect logistic regression models were employed to determine factors associated with changes in serostatus over time .
results while the expected population - level relationship between seroprevalence and disease incidence was observed , on an individual level the relationship between individual infections and the antibody response was complex .
msp - 1 antibody responses were more dynamic in response to the occurrence and resolution of infection events than ama - 1 , while the latter was more correlated with consecutive infections .
the msp - 1 antibody response to an observed infection seemed to decay faster over time than the corresponding ama - 1 response .
surprisingly , there was no evidence of an age effect on the occurrence of a conversion or reversion event .
conclusions while the population - level results concur with previously published sero - epidemiological surveys , the individual - level results highlight the more complex relationship between detected infections and antibody dynamics than can be analysed using cross - sectional data .
the longitudinal analysis of serological data may provide a powerful tool for teasing apart the complex relationship between infection events and the corresponding immune response , thereby improving the ability to rapidly assess the success or failure of malaria control programmes .

quantifying the impact of control strategies on exposure and infection is essential to improving and scaling - up effective strategies [ 2 ] .
this is often accomplished by monitoring changes in incidence , prevalence and / or entomological estimates of malaria transmission intensity [ 3 ] .
one promising alternative approach is the use of serological measures of malaria exposure , which involves detecting antibodies produced by the body in response to an infection in a plasma or serum sample .
anti - malarial antibody responses not only contribute to mediating protection from the disease , but also represent a marker of individual , and population , exposure history .
since antibodies persist longer in the human body than the parasite itself ( longer , too , than the lifespan of the vector ) , serological markers may represent more robust and sensitive measurements of transmission intensity than entomological or parasitological markers [ 4 - 6 ] .
the utility of sero - epidemiological surveillance has been demonstrated by numerous studies in tanzania [ 7 , 8 ] , vanuatu [ 9 ] , equatorial guinea [ 10 ] , brazil [ 11 ] , and uganda [ 12 ] .
the most widely studied markers include antigens to the plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 ( ama - 1 ) and merozoite surface protein 1 ( msp - 119 ) recombinant proteins , both of which have been proposed as malaria vaccine candidates [ 13 ] .
serology has been used as a tool to measure transmission intensity and monitor changes as far back as the 1950s .
nearly all examples of this approach employ cross - sectional serological surveys coupled with serocatalytic models to estimate the average seroconversion and seroreversion rates in the study population [ 7 , 14 ] .
serocatalytic models use age as a proxy for historical time , treating each individual 's observed serostatus as " a random realization of a seroconversion - seroreversion stochastic law " [ 14 ] .
these models often make a number of important assumptions , namely : that the risk of seroconversion is directly proportional to individual exposure ; that individual serostatus is a relatively stable state over time ; and that seroreversion rates are stable over time , meaning that a fixed proportion of people will seroconvert as well as serorevert every year .
these are assumptions that can only be tested in a longitudinal setting .
there have been comparatively few longitudinal assessments of malaria serologic data [ 15 - 21 ] , each with important limitations .
several studies were conducted in very low transmission settings with fewer than a dozen seroconversion events [ 15 , 19 ] , several studies followed participants for less than a year [ 19 , 20 ] , and only one study included older children and adults [ 18 ] .
bejon et al .
[ 22 ] followed a cohort of individuals in kenya for several years ; however , the analysis was restricted to children under 15 years of age , and conducted separately within each survey year rather than longitudinally .
none of these studies investigated individual predictors of seroconversion or seroreversion events , or examined the dynamics of the antibody response following a detectable infection .
there is a relative lack of longitudinal data aimed at elucidating medium or long - term trends in antibody response to malaria in a large study population .
such insights are required to improve the use of serological outcomes in monitoring malaria transmission within large - scale control programmes .
current approaches have been validated to infer longitudinal trends in malaria transmission based on cross - sectional data but nuances in transmission dynamics may be missed [ 4 , 7 , 8 ] .
the richer longitudinal data of the mvomero study in tanzania [ 23 ] was leveraged to examine the temporal dynamics of serostatus and the roles of age and malaria parasitaemia in shaping these dynamics .
the present study specifically explores some of the assumptions that underlie cross - sectional , population - based serological analysis , including the relationship between serostatus and age , the nature of seropositive state , and rates of seroreversion over time .
methods data sources a longitudinal , cluster - randomized study was conducted in 24 randomly selected villages in mvomero district in rural east - central tanzania from 2011 to 2013 .
in a two - stage design , villages were enrolled as clusters and households randomly sampled from within each village ; six study villages were assigned to each of four groups ( control ; a disease management strategy involving early detection and treatment by community health workers using rapid diagnostic technology ; vector control through community - supported larviciding ; and early detection and treatment plus larviciding ) .
a cohort of 5385 people from 962 households ( approximately 40 households per village ) were enrolled and sampled in three consecutive years during the long rainy season , for a total of 16,155 possible measurements .
the first survey was conducted in march and april 2011 , with follow - up conducted in the same months of 2012 and 2013 .
a detailed description of the study design can be found in kramer et al .
[ 23 ] .
this analysis was restricted to the sub - set of individuals for whom parasitological and serological outcomes , for either ama - 1 or msp - 1 , were available at all three time points ; namely , those with complete - case data .
there were 681 individuals with complete - case data for ama - 1 , and 686 individuals with complete - case data for msp - 1 .
there were five individuals with complete information for ama - 1 data who were missing at least one msp - 1 measurement , and there were ten individuals with complete msp - 1 data who were missing at least one ama - 1 measurement .
as a consequence , there were a total of 691 individuals in the current evaluation .
the age ranges , and other relevant characteristics , of these individuals are shown in table 1 .

blood spots were stored with desiccant at - 20 degreesc prior to and after shipping to the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , with laboratory analyses conducted on all samples at the conclusion of the study .
thick and thin blood smears were stained with giemsa solution and examined with a binocular microscope with an oil immersion lens to quantify the parasitaemia .
parasitaemia was measured by counting the number of asexual parasites against the number of leukocytes in the blood film , based on a count of 8000 leukocytes per microlitre .
the number of asexual parasites was counted against 200 leukocytes using a hand tally counter .
a slide was considered negative if no malaria parasite was observed in at least 200 oil - immersion fields .
serological measures antibodies to malaria antigens were detected from serum samples of study participants using indirect enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) .
the technique is described fully in stewart et al .
[ 8 ] .
briefly , plasma is eluted from dried blood spots .
the concentration ( or titre ) of the antibody ( measured in arbitrary units , au , per microlitre ) is inferred by the optical density values recorded from an elisa reader .
raw optical density values are converted into an estimated titer using a standard curve generated by titration of a positive control sample on each assay plate .
this analysis focused on antibodies to the p. falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 ( ama - 1 ; 3d7 strain ) and merozoite surface protein 1 ( msp - 119 ; wellcome genotype ) recombinant proteins , which were produced as described [ 24 , 25 ] .
all samples were processed and analysed together at the conclusion of the study to reduce systematic variation that can arise between batches of reagents .
data analysis two different classes of models were fitted : one using the continuous antibody titre as the outcome , and another using observed ( binary ) seroconversion or seroreversion events as the outcome .
separate models of each class were fitted for ama - 1 and msp - 1 ( for a total of six models ) .
observed seroconversion events were defined as when an individual who was seronegative in one survey year became seropositive in the following year ; observed seroreversion events were defined as when an individual who was seropositive in one survey year become seronegative in the following year .
as such , with data from three consecutive years , it is only possible to identify these events in the final 2 years ( 2012 and 2013 ) .
serostatus ( i.e. , seropositive or seronegative ) was determined by designating a titre threshold , above which a sample was deemed to be seropositive , and below which was deemed to be seronegative .
for each antigen , this threshold was determined by fitting a two - component normal mixture model to the estimated titer distribution ; the threshold was calculated as the mean of the ' seronegative ' ( i.e. lower titer ) component plus three standard deviations [ 5 ] .
the continuous antibody titre models were fitted as normal mixed - effects models [ 26 ] with natural log - transformed antibody titres as the outcome and individual - level random intercepts accounting for the correlation within individuals over time .
for the seroconversion / seroreversion models , the outcome was a binary indicator of whether or not a seroconversion or seroreversion event was observed in 2012 or 2013 .
the model was fitted as a logistic regression with random intercepts at the individual level .
each individual could only contribute a single positive outcome ( i.e. , could only seroconvert or serorevert once ) to each model because there were only two follow - up time periods , making the comparison between individuals who experienced an event vs those who never experienced that event ( e.g. , an individual who seroconverted in 2012 did not contribute to the model for 2013 , since they had already seroconverted ) .
in both classes of models , lasso variable selection was used to find the most parsimonious model [ 27 ] .
the following set of possible predictors was entered : age , presence or absence of an observed malaria infection ( either concurrent with the outcome event or in the preceding year ) , and serostatus for the alternate antibody ( i.e. , msp - 1 as a predictor when ama - 1 is the outcome , and vice versa ) , both concurrent with the outcome event and in the previous year .
in addition , an indicator variable for year ( 2012 vs 2013 ) was included to account for differences in the number of events between survey years .
the two - way interactions for all predictors listed above were included in the model selection procedure .
the relationship between cross - sectional seroprevalence and age is known to follow a logistic growth curve , often modelled using a reversible catalytic conversion ( rcc ) model [ 7 , 28 ] .
to account for the non - linear relationship between age and seropositivity , the exposure - driven relationship with age was modelled as a linear spline with a knot at age 20 .
exploratory analyses determined this to be a reasonable approximation , with the spline expressing a similar value for the concordance ( c ) statistic [ 29 ] compared to the corresponding rcc model for both antibodies ( for ama - 1 : spline c = 0.85 , rcc c = 0.84 ; for msp - 1 : spline c = 0.72 , rcc c = 0.72 ) .
in practice , after implementing the lasso approach for each outcome and for both antibodies , all two - way interactions were dropped from each of the six final models .
all analyses were performed using sas / stat software , version 9.4 of the sas system for windows .

results descriptive statistics the characteristics of the 691 individuals in the analysis sample are shown by survey year in table 1 .
most ( 423 individuals , 61.3 % of the sample ) were below the age of 10 years at baseline ; due to aging , this shifted to 376 ( 54.4 %) by the third survey .
relatively few people in this cohort were between the ages of 10 and 20 years , with 49 individuals in 2011 ( 7.1 %) , rising to 92 ( 13.3 %) by 2013 .
one - hundred and thirty - nine individuals ( 20.1 %) had at least one malaria infection during the study ; 34 individuals were missing a malaria status in at least one survey year. of the 176 total observed malaria infections , 34 ( 19.3 %) were in 2011 , 47 ( 26.7 %) were in 2012 , and 95 ( 54.0 %) were in 2013 .
there were 92 observed seroconversion events for ama - 1 and 152 for msp - 1 ( corresponding to 13.5 and 22.1 % of individuals , respectively ) .
for both antibodies , the majority ( 79.3 and 72.3 % , respectively ) of seroconversion events were observed in 2013 .
additionally , there were 102 observed seroreversion events for ama - 1 and 103 for msp - 1 , with the majority ( 79.4 and 74.8 % , respectively ) being observed in 2012 .
individuals were classified by observed malaria infection ' trajectory ' - in other words , their malaria infection status across time in each survey year ; the characteristics of individuals within each trajectory group are shown in table 2 .
thirty - four individuals with missing parasitaemia data were excluded. of the 139 individuals with at least one detected malaria infection , 27 ( 19.4 %) had multiple detected infections during the follow - up period .
these 27 were , on average , younger than those with one or zero observed infections .
the proportion of seropositive individuals was greater amongst participants with at least one observed infection ( 0.72 for ama - 1 and 0.68 for msp - 1 ; n = 139 ) than among those never infected ( 0.49 for ama - 1 and 0.45 for msp - 1 ; n = 518 ) .

an individual who was only seropositive in 2011 would have a trajectory of 100 , etc. ) .
for both antibodies , individuals who were seropositive at multiple time points ( e.g. , 110 ) were , on average , older than individuals who were never seropositive .
malaria infection prevalence was greater among individuals who were seropositive in at least one time point ( ama - 1 : 101 / 367 or 27.5 % ; msp - 1 : 99 / 344 or 28.8 %) compared to individuals who were seronegative at all time points ( ama - 1 : 41 / 314 or 13.1 % ; msp - 1 : 45 / 342 or 13.2 %) .

although seropositive individuals had a greater degree of variability in their absolute titre values , seronegative individuals also had a high level of variation especially if these individuals are interpreted as malaria - naive or unexposed. fig. 1 individual log titre trajectories across survey years .
for ama - 1 ( a ) and msp - 1 ( b ) by serostatus classification ( 0 seronegative , 1 seropositive ; e.g. 001 denotes seronegative in 2011 and 2012 , then seropositive in 2013 , etc. ) the distribution of log - titre by serostatus as a function of age within each survey year is shown in fig. 2. the relationship between age and median titre ( denoted on the plots by the solid line ) roughly matches the logarithmic growth of seroprevalence over age observed in cross - sectional surveys [ 7 ]. of particular interest is the difference between the age trends for ama - 1 and msp - 1 ( panel a vs panel b ) .
the slope is sharper for ama - 1 than for msp - 1 , with an apparent decline within the oldest strata of age ( though this may in part be driven by a smaller sample size within that strata ) .
this is consistent with previously reported differences in seroprevalence for these antigens [ 7 , 20 ]. fig. 2 age - stratified seroprevalence curves in each survey years .

the points denote an individual 's log - titre value for the respective antibody in the given survey year , colored red for titres classified as seropositive and blue for titres classified as seronegative .
the solid lines connect the median log - titre within each age group individual seroconversion event models individuals who were seronegative in one year and seropositive the following year ( i.e. , in 2011 and 2012 , or in 2012 and 2013 ) were defined as having seroconverted .
those who seroconverted were compared to those who remained seronegative in a mixed - effects logistic regression .
table 4 shows the odds ratios for seroconverting for ama - 1 and msp - 1 .
individuals had 3.6 [ 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 2.1 - 6.2 ] times greater odds of seroconverting for ama - 1 in 2013 than in 2012 , and 2.8 ( 95 % ci 1.9 - 4.3 ) times greater odds for msp - 1 .
age did not significantly impact individual odds of seroconverting for ama - 1 , but did for msp - 1 : individuals 20 years of age and younger were slightly less likely to seroconvert ( or 0.93 , 95 % ci 0.89 - 0.97 ) while individuals older than 20 were slightly more likely to seroconvert ( or 1.08 , 95 % ci 1.02 - 1.16 ) .
individuals who seroconverted to the alternate antigen were significantly more likely to seroconvert to the outcome antigen , compared to individuals who remained seronegative across both years to the alternate antigen : msp - 1 seroconversion ( in a given year ) was associated with 2.79 - fold ( 95 % ci 1.64 - 4.76 ) higher odds of ama - 1 seroconversion in that same year , while ama - 1 seroconversion was associated with 3.93 - fold ( 95 % ci 2.26 - 6.81 ) higher odds of msp - 1 seroconversion .
seroreversion to the alternate antigen , on the other hand , was associated with significantly reduced odds of seroconversion to the outcome antigen ( compared to individuals who remained seronegative across both years to the alternate antigen ) : the odds of seroconverting for ama - 1 was multiplied by 0.25 ( 95 % ci 0.13 - 0.50 ) when a seroreversion was observed for msp - 1 compared to those who did not experience a seroreversion .
the odds ratio of seroconverting for msp - 1 when a seroreversion for ama - 1 was observed in the same year was 0.50 ( 95 % ci 0.28 - 0.90 ) .
being seropositive in both years for msp - 1 did not impact the odds of ama - 1 seroconversion ( or 0.70 , 95 % ci 0.36 - 1.34 ) compared to being seronegative in both years for msp - 1 .
however , for those who were being positive for ama - 1 in both years , the odds of msp - 1 seroconversion was multiplied by 1.97 ( 95 % ci 1.10 - 3.51 ) , compared to being negative in both years .

however , individuals who had a malaria infection in both years had 2.77 ( 95 % ci 1.11 - 6.89 ) times higher odds of seroconverting compared to individuals without an infection in either year. by contrast , in the msp - 1 model , those who did not have an observed malaria infection in the preceding year but did have one in the concurrent year were significantly more likely to msp - 1 seroconvert than individuals with no observed malaria infections in either year ( or 2.70 , 95 % ci 1.65 - 4.42 ) .
individuals who did not have a malaria infection in the concurrent year but did in the preceding year were significantly less likely to msp - 1 seroconvert ( or 0.37 , 95 % ci 0.15 - 0.95 ) .
having a malaria infection in both years was not associated with any difference in the odds of msp - 1 seroconversion ( or 1.00 ; 95 % ci 0.38 - 2.68 ) , compared to individuals with no observed infections .
individual seroreversion event models using a similar principle as for seroconversion , a seroreversion event was defined as when an individual who was seropositive in a given year ( 2011 or 2012 ) was seronegative in the following year ( 2012 or 2013 ) .
those who seroreverted were compared to those who remained seropositive in a mixed - effects logistic regression .
table 4 shows the odds ratios for the analogous seroreversion models for ama - 1 and msp - 1 .
for both antigens , individuals were less likely to serorevert in 2013 than in 2012 ( for ama - 1 : or = 0.31 , 95 % ci 0.19 - 0.53 ; for msp - 1 : or 0.43 , 95 % ci 0.26 - 0.79 ) .
for ama - 1 , individuals 20 years or younger in age were more likely to serorevert ( or 1.06 ; 95 % ci 1.02 - 1.10 ) .
older individuals were no more or less likely to serorevert for ama - 1 , and neither age effect was significant in the msp - 1 model .
individuals who seroreverted to the alternate antigen in the same time frame were significantly more likely to serorevert to the outcome antigen , compared to individuals who remained seropositive in both years : seroreversions for msp - 1 were associated with increased odds of seroreverting for ama - 1 ( or 3.21 ; 95 % ci 1.72 - 6.02 ) while seroreversions for ama - 1 were associated with 2.58 - fold ( 95 % ci 1.41 - 4.74 ) greater odds of seroreverting for msp - 1 .
meanwhile , seroconverting to the alternate antigen was associated with reduced odds of seroreverting to the outcome antigen , compared to individuals who remained seropositive in both years : individuals who seroconverted for msp - 1 were 0.50 ( 95 % ci 0.29 - 0.87 ) as likely to serorevert for ama - 1 , while individuals who seroconverted for ama - 1 were 0.40 ( 95 % ci 0.21 - 0.72 ) as likely to serorevert for msp - 1 .
in both cases , the odds of seroreversion to the outcome antigen was not impacted by remaining seronegative to the alternate antigen in both years ( for ama - 1 , or 1.60 , 95 % ci 0.89 - 2.86 ; for msp - 1 , or 1.00 , 95 % ci 0.53 - 1.90 ) .
having a malaria infection in the current , previous or both years was not significantly associated with ama - 1 seroreversion compared to individuals without any observed infections .
for msp - 1 , having an observed malaria infection in the previous year but not the current year was associated with higher odds of seroreverting ( or 1.95 ; 95 % ci 0.89 - 4.25 ) compared to individuals without an infection in either year , but the effect was not statistically significant .
neither concurrent malaria infections ( or 0.98 ; 95 % ci 0.45 - 2.09 ) nor having a malaria infection in both years ( or 1.90 ; 95 % ci 0.69 - 5.23 ) were significantly related to the odds of msp - 1 seroreversion , again compared with individuals with no observed infections .
continuous titre models the continuous titre models were fitted as mixed - effects models with the natural log - transformed titre values for each antibody as the outcome .
table 5 shows the parameter estimates for the continuous antibody titre models for ama - 1 and msp - 1 .
average log - titres were higher in 2013 than 2012 for both antibodies ( ama - 1 : 0.11 , 95 % ci 0.04 - 0.18 ; msp - 1 : 0.45 , 95 % ci 0.35 - 0.56 ) .
antibody titre in a given year is most strongly correlated to the titre in the previous year ( ama - 1 : 0.75 , 95 % ci 0.72 - 0.79 ) ; msp - 1 : 0.68 , 95 % ci 0.64 - 0.72 ) .
titre was significantly higher in participants with a concurrent malaria infection ( ama - 1 : 0.27 , 95 % ci 0.16 - 0.38 ; msp - 1 : 0.29 , 95 % ci 0.12 - 0.47 ) .
antibody titres in the concurrent year were correlated : a one unit increase in msp - 1 titre was associated with a 0.21 ( 95 % ci 0.18 - 0.25 ) increase in ama - 1 titre , and a one - unit increase in ama - 1 titre was associated with a 0.53 ( 95 % ci 0.45 - 0.61 ) unit increase in msp - 1 titre .
there was an inverse relationship between outcome antibody titre and titre for the alternate antibody in the previous year .
log ama - 1 titre decreased by 0.11 ( 95 % ci 0.07 - 0.14 ) for each one - log increase in msp - 1 titre in the previous year .
a similar relationship is observed for msp - 1 titre , which decreased by 0.34 ( 95 % ci 0.25 - 0.42 ) for each one log increase in ama - 1 titre in the previous year .
the major difference between the two antibodies is the direction of the effect for observed malaria infections in the preceding year .
for ama - 1 , an observed malaria infection in the preceding year , but not the concurrent year , was significantly associated with higher log - titre ( 0.15 ; 95 % ci 0.01 - 0.29 ) .
the opposite effect was observed for msp - 1 titre ; malaria infection in the preceding year was associated with lower log - titre in the concurrent year ( - 0.34 ; 95 % ci - 0.42 to 0.25 ) .

the profiles of these responses over time were more dynamic than anticipated : seroreversion events were just as common as seroconversion events ( in fact , for ama - 1 , they were more common ) .
further , the number of events changed dramatically between subsequent surveys , with a 300 % increase in the total number of seroconversion events between 2011 and 12 and 2012 and 13 and a corresponding 70 % reduction in the total number of seroreversion events over the same time period , which parallels changes in infection prevalence estimates between the surveys .
in contrast , studies using cross - sectional data often assume static rates over time , especially for seroreversion [ 4 , 7 , 14 , 15 ] .
although there are extensions of these methods designed to detect changes in the seroconversion rate at specific points in time , for model - fitting purposes these often treat the seroreversion rate as fixed [ 8 , 30 ] .
despite the well - studied relationship between age and population - level seroprevalence that forms the basis of most cross - sectional models , such as the reversible catalytic conversion and superinfection models [ 7 , 10 , 30 ] , the present analyses of individual - level changes across years found age to have very little role in predicting individual titre levels or the incidence of individual seroconversion or seroreversion events .
this concords with the findings of yman et al .
[ 31 ] and wipasa et al .
[ 32 ] , who both observed a lack of a distinct age effect on individual antibody titres .
this implies that change in serostatus may be solely governed by age - independent exposures , and it is the accumulation of these exposures over time that results in age - dependent seroprevalence patterns , rather than the mechanisms of change themselves being a function of age .
while there were few age - related effects on change in serostatus in this study , on average the individuals with multiple observed detectable infections were younger than individuals with one or fewer infections .
it is possible that the greater number of infections in the youngest individuals resulted in higher antibody responses , whereas adults were either infected less frequently or had sub - microscopic infections that served to maintain antibody response levels .
as expected , on a population level , the occurrence of seroconversion and seroreversion events tracked with changes in the number of observed infection events , with higher incidence of malaria associated with a higher number of seroconversions for both antibodies [ 4 , 10 , 12 , 20 , 33 ] .
the increase in seroconversion events and decrease in seroreversion events between 2011 and 2012 and 2012 and 2013 corresponded with a twofold increase in the number of observed malaria infections .
however , the individual - level models demonstrated more complex dynamics at work , with different patterns and magnitudes of responsiveness for ama - 1 and msp - 1 to the introduction , resolution and sustenance of detectible infections .
seroconversion for msp - 1 was related to changes in infection status ( with subsequent infections associated with greater odds and resolved infections associated with lower odds ) .
however , seroreversion was not sensitive to such changes .
meanwhile , changes in ama - 1 serostatus were not especially sensitive to changes in infection status , but consecutive ( or repeated ) infections in subsequent survey years were associated with significantly elevated odds of seroconversion .
overall , msp - 1 appeared to be more sensitive to ' short - term ' ( i.e. , 1 year ) changes in infection status while ama - 1 was more sensitive to ' long - term ' ( i.e. , 2 year ) changes .
however , interpretation is limited by the lack of complete infection histories for the individuals in this cohort .
the present results differ from some of the common assumptions made by cross - sectional analyses ; further analysis of longitudinal serologic data may reveal more complexities that cross - sectional methods are ill suited to fully capture .
for example , between 2011 and 2012 , the number of observed seroreversion events for both antibodies were markedly higher than the number of seroconversion events , despite a slight increase in the observed number of malaria infections .
this suggests the possibility that there was a change in transmission intensity not directly observable through looking at prevalence alone .
the apparent relationship between seroreversion and exposure implies that changes in seroreversion rates ( and not just a reduction in seroconversion rates as in many cross - sectional studies ) may be a useful monitoring tool for understanding changes in exposure , particularly in the context of a highly effective prevention intervention .
further , a cross - sectional approach using standard serocatalytic models is ill suited to estimating seroreversion rates [ 15 , 34 ] , and would have underestimated the change in seroconversion and seroreversion rates observed between survey years .
the results from the continuous titre models support the inferences from the seroevent - based models .
the increased odds of a seroconversion event , and decreased odds of a seroreversion event , between the 2012 and 2013 survey years coincides with both an increase in the average log - titre levels for both antibodies from 2012 to 2013 and a concomitant increase in the number of observed infections .
it was also observed that if an individual 's log - titre increases for one antibody , it will , on average , increase for the other during the same time frame .
this reflects the same phenomenon whereby if an individual seroconverts for one antibody they are more likely to seroconvert for the other .
similarly , the negative coefficient for alternate antibody in the previous year suggests that if an individual seroreverts for one antibody they are less likely to seroconvert for the other .
for both ama - 1 and msp - 1 , changes in serostatus were correlated , but maintaining serostatus for one antigen did not affect the odds of seroconversion or seroreversion for the other .
concurrent malaria infections were associated with increased average log - titre levels for both antibodies .
however , previous malaria infections were associated with significantly increased log - titre for ama - 1 , but significantly decreased log - titre for msp - 1 .
consecutive infection statuses were associated with significantly increased log - titre for ama - 1 , but did not impact average log - titre levels for msp - 1 .
this would seem to imply that , while antibody titre is elevated for both during an infection , the response is preserved over a longer time frame for ama - 1 than for msp - 1 , which may begin to clear more rapidly following the resolution of the infection .
this would account for the differential effects of previous year infection status and consecutive infection statuses on outcomes between the ama - 1 models and the msp - 1 models .
serological and parasite based analysis may be operating on different temporal scales , something that is reflected in both the time required to mount a response and the persistence of antibodies following infection .
more work remains to be done to refine the statistical methods necessary to most efficiently leverage continuous serologic data .
however , this study demonstrates that the serostatus - based and titre - based models can produce complementary results in a longitudinal framework .
the stimulation of these antibodies as a response to known infection events is not well understood , and is further complicated by boosting due to repeated infections [ 35 ] .
while some studies have demonstrated rapid acquisition and clearance patterns in response to clinical malaria infections [ 36 - 38 ] , others have found responses to be more persistent over time [ 5 , 7 , 32 ] .
the presence or absence of symptoms or parasite densities may influence the response profile of the antibodies , which may be related to acquired immunity as a function of lifetime exposure patterns [ 16 , 20 ] .
although some studies have compared the results of separate models of antibody responses , the examination of the relationship between the response of different antibodies within the same model , as done in the present study , has been an underexplored area of research [ 17 , 21 ] .
one strength of the present study is that the continuous titre models have the outcome antibody titre in the previous year as a predictor of that antibody titre in the current year .
the magnitude of that coefficient gives an estimate of the degree to which an antibody response is maintained on a year - to - year basis , controlling for both infection status at point of sampling and titre for the alternate antibody .
this would seem to further support the notion that the msp - 1 response decays at a faster rate than ama - 1 , since the degree to which elevated titre in the previous year is associated with current titre is reduced .
although this would contrast with the findings of akpogheneta et al .
[ 17 ] , who did not identify any differences between the short - term response dynamics of ama - 1 and msp - 1 , this interpretation supports the findings of white et al .
[ 21 ] , who calculated shorter half - lives for long - lasting antibody - secreting cells to msp - 1 compared to ama - 1 , and wipasa et al .
[ 32 ] .
there are several important limitations to this study .
the sub - set of individuals included in the analysis ( i.e. , individuals with serological data at all three surveys ) represents a biased sample from the overall mvomero study population : e.g. , there were more children under five and adult women used in this analysis compared to the overall sample .
however , that these characteristics were not associated with any of our outcomes mitigates concerns about the influence of selection bias on the interpretation of the results [ 39 ] .
further , the number of seropositive ( for both antibodies ) and infection events per survey in our subset were comparable with those in the overall sample .
the classification of individuals as seropositive and seronegative makes a number of assumptions regarding the distribution of antibody titre in the population and how it relates to discrete biological states [ 40 ] .
although some of the ' observed ' events are likely to be spurious ( i.e. , incurred by the assumption of a fixed titre cut - off separating distinct positive and negative sub - populations ) , there is no a priori reason to assume that this impacts seroreversion estimates any more or less so than it does seroconversion estimates ( for example , misclassification may be expected to result in a global over - or underestimation of the rate of change of serostatus within the population , but not to preferentially misclassify individuals as having seroreverted compared to seroconverted or vice versa ) .
further , this is a limitation shared by other analytic frameworks for estimating population serodynamics and is not specific to this study , while the general agreement between the sero - event - based and continuous titre models assuages concerns over the validity of the dichotomization .
finally , the present study relies on serological and parasitological measurements taken a year apart during the march - april rainy season .
it is possible that this does not give a granular enough picture of individual infection or titre trajectories over time to make positive determinations about the way these trajectories are shaped by infection events .
undoubtedly , many infection events went unobserved between the sampling time - points ; in addition , submicroscopic infections , which may potentially make up a large proportion of all malaria infections [ 41 ] , would not have been detected in this study .
however , this is no different from cross - sectional surveys that use age - stratified seroprevalence curves as proxies for cumulative exposure over time [ 7 ] .
further , more work needs to be done to understand the relevance of submicroscopic infections on malaria transmission , surveillance , and control .
despite this , the concordance of this study 's results with those reported in other studies gives confidence that these limitations do not invalidate the conclusions drawn .
conclusions the potential of serologic data in malaria surveillance in a variety of transmission settings has long been acknowledged [ 5 ] .
several authors have used retrospective analyses of repeated cross - sectional surveys to track population - level changes in malaria transmission using serologic data [ 42 - 44 ] .
such cross - sectional analyses of malaria serology data have been proposed as a tool for surveillance , with shifts in the age - stratified seroprevalence curves used to identify the success or failure of malaria control programmes [ 4 , 8 , 43 ] .
this approach has been shown to perform well in estimating medium and long - term trends [ 7 , 14 ] .
however , these cross - sectional methods use age as a substitute for time , and any judgements of a control programme 's success can only be made after cohorts of programme - exposed individuals have made their way through the population age structure .
thus , it may take years for the effect of a programme on seroprevalence to become detectible if relying solely on long - lived antigens of exposure such as ama - 1 and msp - 1 .
these methods are useful for providing an overview of average transmission levels in the population or for evaluating consistent and sustained changes in exposure over several years ; however , they are limited in their ability to detect short term changes .
they are further limited by an inability to adjust for individual - level differences in patterns of exposure over time .
longitudinal methods , on the other hand , can model time directly ; the indicator variable for survey year in the models used in these analyses may act as a direct measurement of year - to - year fluctuations in exposure across the study population .
longitudinal surveillance of events is likely to be more sensitive than cross - sectional methods , particularly to short - term changes in malaria exposure .
the present study demonstrates that longitudinal serostatus and titre changes track with other metrics of transmission ( e.g. , prevalence ) , while also offering additional insight not possible through prevalence or cross - sectional methods alone ( e.g. , the occurrence of seroreversion events between survey years ) .
the simultaneous modelling of multiple antigens with different response dynamics offers a novel method for potentially shedding light on the timing of changes in exposure .
further , this approach highlights the potential of the use of the continuous variable of antibody titres in repeated sampling for determining the efficacy of a programme .

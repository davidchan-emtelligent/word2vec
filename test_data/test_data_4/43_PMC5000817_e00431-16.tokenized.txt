bacteriophage ( phage ) vb _ abam _ me3 was previously isolated from wastewater effluent using the propagating host acinetobacter baumannii dsm 30007 .
the full genome was sequenced , revealing it to be the largest acinetobacter bacteriophage sequenced to date with a size of 234,900 bp and containing 326 open reading frames ( orfs ) .
this research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public , commercial , or not - for - profit sectors.cover - datejuly / august 2016 genome announcement acinetobacter baumannii has emerged in recent times as an important nosocomial pathogen .
health care - acquired a. baumannii infections include pneumonia and urinary tract and bloodstream infections ( 1 ) .
there is only a small number of bacteriophages ( phages ) with genomes greater than 200 kbp ( termed " jumbo " phages ) that have had their genomes sequenced to date .
most of their encoded proteins do not have any homologues in current sequence databases , and the diversity of these phages has been great enough that it has limited comparative genomics studies ( 2 ) .
a phage with the ability to lyse a. baumannii strain dsm 30007 was isolated from effluent obtained from a wastewater treatment plant in cork , ireland .
transmission electron microscopy revealed that the phage belonged to the myoviridae family , and according to nomenclature proposed by kropinski et al. was named vb _ abam _ me3 ( me3 ) ( 3 ) .
a high titer phage suspension was concentrated by ultracentrifugation , and dna extraction was performed as previously described ( 4 ) .
dna was sequenced using the 454 flx titanium plus sequencing approach ( lgc genomics , mannheim , germany ) .
open reading frames ( orfs ) were identified using glimmer and genemarks ( 5 , 6 ) , with possible function of these orfs' proteins being predicted with blastp , pfam , interproscan , thmhmm v.2.0 , lipop v1.0 ( 7 - 11 ) , with trnascan.se 1.21 being used to locate any trna present in the genome ( 12 ) .
to date , this is the largest acinetobacter phage genome sequenced , with a size of 234,900 bp ( the genome ends of me3 are not known ) .
the overall % g + c is 40 % , similar to that of its host ( 13 ) .
the genome was predicted to have 326 orfs with four trna genes .
on the basis of homology , putative functions were assigned to 77 orfs , with 19 orfs annotated as putative membrane proteins , two orfs annotated as putative lipoproteins , and the remaining 228 orfs being annotated as hypothetical proteins .
phage me3 is an orphan phage , however , it has eight orfs encoding structural proteins that share homology to those of the novel bacillus phage 0305phi8 - 36 ( genbank accession number nc _ 009760.1 ) , although showing high levels of divergence ( percentage identity of 26 % to 34 %) .
the major head protein ( me3 _ 22 ) , portal protein ( me3 _ 19 ) , and tail sheath subunit ( me3 _ 29 ) are examples of such proteins .
until now , these proteins of 0305phi8 - 36 have only been found to share homology with those of phage - like elements found in the genomes of b. thuringiensis serovar israelensis and b. weihenstephanensis ( 14 ). with regard to these structural proteins and the large terminase subunit ( me3 _ 13 ) , phages me3 and 0305phi8 - 36 may share a distant ancestor .
phage me3 appears to encode its own dna replication machinery including dna polymerase subunits ( me3 _ 60 and 61 ) , thymidylate synthase enzymes ( me3 _ 107 and 108 ) , helicases , and enzymes involved in dna degradation and repair .
me3 also possesses two cell wall degrading enzymes , me3 _ 8 , a lysozyme with proven lytic activity against a. baumannii and me3 _ 113 , a putative cell wall hydrolase .
phage me3 also has a curiously large number of genes associated with ter - stress response ( me3 _ 286 , 284 , 289 , 290 , and 291 ) and a massive protein of 5,419 amino acids ( me3 _ 104 ) possessing domains relating to host specificity and binding ( ipr015406 , ipr008979 ) .
accession number ( s ) .
the full genome sequence of a. baumannii phage vb _ abam _ me3 was deposited in genbank under the accession number ku935715 .

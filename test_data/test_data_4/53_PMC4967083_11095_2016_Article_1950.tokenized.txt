purpose ionizing radiation ( ir ) generates reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , which cause dna double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) that are responsible for cytogenetic alterations .
because antioxidants are potent ros scavengers , we determined whether the vitamin e isoform gamma - tocotrienol ( gt3 ) , a radio - protective multifunctional dietary antioxidant , can suppress ir - induced cytogenetic damage .
methods we measured dsb formation in irradiated primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) by quantifying the formation of gamma - h2ax foci .
chromosomal aberrations ( cas ) were analyzed in irradiated huvecs and in the bone marrow cells of irradiated mice by conventional and fluorescence - based chromosome painting techniques .
gene expression was measured in huvecs with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qrt - pcr ) .
results gt3 pretreatment reduced dsb formation in huvecs , and also decreased cas in huvecs and mouse bone marrow cells after irradiation .
moreover , gt3 increased expression of the dna - repair gene rad50 and attenuated radiation - induced rad50 suppression .
conclusions gt3 attenuates radiation - induced cytogenetic damage , possibly by affecting rad50 expression .
gt3 should be explored as a therapeutic to reduce the risk of developing genetic diseases after radiation exposure .

ros are highly reactive and damage dna , as well as various cellular components .
mammalian cells exposed to 1 gy of ir accumulate approximately 1000 single - strand breaks , 40 double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) , and 3000 damaged dna bases ( 1 ) .
dsbs are serious lesions that can cause numerous structural chromosomal aberrations ( cas ) such as sister chromatid unions , chromatid - or chromosome - type breaks , and dicentric or ring chromosomes ( 2 ) .
such cas are particularly deleterious and are associated with the progression and development of several diseases , including cancer ( 3 ) .
to date , cas have been found in all major tumor types and are also associated with mental illness , congenital heart disease , and respiratory problems ( 4 - 6 ) .
this suggests that cas are not only a hallmark of cancer but also a cytogenetic signature of various pathophysiological conditions .
while cas can arise spontaneously , radiation is a major factor that induces cas .
dna - repair proteins such as rad50 mitigate cas by repairing dsbs .
curiously , radiation suppresses rad50 gene expression in mouse white blood cells for up to 48 h after irradiation ( 7 ) .
rad50 is part of the mrn complex which consists of meiotic recombination 11 ( mre11 ) , rad50 , and nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 ( nbs1 ) proteins .
the primary function of the mrn complex is to recognize dsbs , bind the damaged dna , and initiate repair by regulating the homologous recombination pathway and the alternate - non - homologous end - joining cascade with support from other dna - repair proteins ( 8 ) .
the type and frequency of radiation - induced cas vary with radiation dose , dose rate , and the quality of irradiation .
cas may be evident in metaphase chromosomes soon after irradiation , or they may appear several generations later .
this delay is a sign of genomic instability and is a hallmark of cancer ( 9 ) .
similarly , ir is a major risk factor for endothelial dysfunction ( 10 ) , and genetically unstable endothelial cells can directly stimulate cancer metastases ( 11,12 ) .
thus , both cancer and endothelial dysfunction may benefit from therapies that reduce radiation - induced oxidative stress .
antioxidants suppress dsbs and cas in irradiated human lymphocytes ( 13,14 ) .
the vitamin e isoform gamma - tocotrienol ( gt3 ) is a natural dietary antioxidant and a potent radio - protector , with the largest dose reduction factor among all the natural products identified to date ( 15,16 ) .
gt3 protects the endothelials cells that line the blood and lymphatic vessels of higher eukaryotes ( 17 ) , regulates a number of signaling pathways that mitigate radiation damage ( 18 ) , and also protects mice from a lethal dose of radiation ( 16 ) .
although we do not fully understand how gt3 protects against radiation damage , studies by various groups , including our own , suggest that gt3 may regulate apoptotic signals , cytokine production , cholesterol biosynthesis , or progenitor cell mobilization ( 17,19 - 21 ) .
moreover , gene - expression profiles suggest that gt3 affects a number of genes known to be important for the dna damage response ( 18 ) .
here , we demonstrate that gt3 pretreatment decreases the frequency of radiation - induced dsbs and cas both in vitro and in vivo .
we also show that gt3 stabilizes rad50 expression after irradiation .
these findings suggest that gt3 is a potent radio - protector that can protect against radiation - induced cytogenetic damage .
materials and methods materials gt3 was obtained from yasoo health inc .

all other reagents and media were obtained from sigma ( st. louis , mo ) .
cell culture and animals primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) ( american type culture collection , manassas , va ) were cultured in tissue culture vessels with egm - 2 bullet kit in 5 % co2 incubator at 37degreesc .
the cells were passaged every 2 to 3 days with standard aseptic techniques , and experiments were performed using cells from passages 3 to 6 .
all animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health .
the animal protocol was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the university of arkansas for medical sciences .
female c57bl / 6j mice ( the jackson laboratory , bar harbor , me , stock no .
000664 ) were held in quarantine for 1 week after arrival .
all animals were housed in conventional cages in a standard air conditioned animal facility at 20 +/ - 2degreesc , with 10 - 15 hourly cycles of fresh air , and a 12 - 12 - h day - night light cycle .
animals had free access to water and chow ( envigo teklad diet 7012 , madison , wi ) .
all animals were humanely euthanized with co2 in an appropriate chamber .
irradiation and drug treatment mice were irradiated with a single , total - body radiation dose ( 3 gy ) in a shepherd mark i model 25 137cs irradiator ( j. l. shepherd & associates , san fernando , ca ) .
the average dose rate was 0.98 gy / min and was corrected for decay .
the animals were placed in a well - ventilated rotating chamber composed of t - 6061 aluminum with a gold - anodized coating .
the chamber was divided into eight equal " pie slice " compartments with a well - ventilated plexiglas lid ( j.l. shepherd & associates ) .
animals were injected subcutaneously into the loose skin over the neck with a single dose of gt3 or vehicle ( 5 % tween - 80 in saline ) 24 h before irradiation .
all radiation experiments were performed in the morning to minimize diurnal effects .
huvecs were irradiated in t25 tissue - culture flasks ( corning , ny ) or chambered slides ( nunc lab - tek , st. louis , mo ) .
huvecs were treated with 0 - 5 mum of gt3 or vehicle ( dmso ) prior to irradiation .
radiation doses used for the various studies were carefully selected based on experimental endpoints and knowledge regarding cellular radio - sensitivity .
gamma - h2ax detection huvecs were grown in 4 - well chambered slides overnight and treated with gt3 or vehicle ( dmso ) for 1 h or 24 h before irradiation .
cells were washed with pbs and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde 1 h after irradiation .
the fixed cells were washed , permeabilized with 0.3 % triton - x for 15 min at room temperature , quenched with 1 % glycine , and blocked with 4 % bsa in 1x tbst overnight at 4degreesc .
the cells were incubated with primary antibody ( 1:600 dilution ; monoclonal anti - phospho - histone h2ax ( ser139 ) , clone jbw301 ; millipore , temecula , ca ) for 3 h at room temperature .
after washing 3 times with pbs , secondary antibody ( alexa fluor 594 f ( ab ') 2 fragment of goat anti - mouse igg ; invitrogen , grand island , ny ) was added , and the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark .
finally , the cells were washed with pbs and stained with hoechst solution to visualize nuclei .
gamma - h2ax foci were detected with a zeiss axioplan microscope .
gamma - h2ax foci were not counted in apoptotic cells .
the apoptotic cells , particularly cells in late apoptotic stages , were identified by their highly compromised nuclear membrane .
preparation of metaphase spreads for in vitro experiments , huvecs were treated with 5 mul / ml colcemid ( invitrogen , grand island , ny ) 24 h before cell harvest .
huvecs were collected by trypsinization and washed 2 times with pbs .
for in vivo experiments , mice were given 100 mul of 0.05 % colchicine intraperitoneally 2 h before bone marrow harvest .
bone marrow cells were collected from the tibias and femurs of both hind legs by flushing with ice cold pbs containing 2 % fbs .
the cell suspension was layered onto equal volume ( 3 ml ) of histopaque - 1083 ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) in a 15 - ml tube .
the tubes were centrifuged at 400 g for 30 min at room temperature .
the buffy coat , containing bone marrow mononuclear cells , was collected and washed with pbs .
huvecs and mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells were then treated with hypotonic solution ( 0.56 % kcl solution ) for 15 min and fixed in methanol - acetic acid ( 3:1 ) .
fixed cells were applied to precleaned , wet glass slides and air - dried overnight at room temperature .
chromosome staining techniques two techniques were used to examine cas in metaphase spreads .
giemsa staining : metaphase spreads were prepared as described above and air dried at room temperature overnight .
slides were immersed in giemsa staining solution ( fisher scientific ) for 20 min , rinsed in distilled water to remove excess stain , and air - dried for 24 h before scoring at 100x magnification under bright field on a zeiss microscope .
multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization ( mfish ) painting : whole - chromosome dna probes ( applied spectral imaging , carlsbad , ca ) were used to label human and mouse chromosomes 1 , 2 , and 3 , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
metaphase spreads were prepared 24 h before mfish painting .
the slides were treated with 2x ssc buffer at room temperature for 2 min , then dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions ( 70 % , 80 % , and 100 %) for 2 min each .
chromosomes were denatured by placing the slides in pre - warmed ( 72degreesc ) denaturation solution ( 70 % formamide in 2x ssc ) for 60 - 80 s , then immediately passed through a series of cold ethanol solutions ( 70 % , 80 % , and 100 %) and air - dried .
mfish probe ( 10 mul ) was denatured at 80degreesc for 7 min and applied to the slides .
the slides were covered with glass cover slips , sealed with rubber cement , and incubated overnight at 37degreesc in a humidified co2 incubator .
the coverslips were removed , and the slides were washed with 0.4x ssc at 74degreesc for 5 min and placed in washing solution - ii ( 4x ssc with 0.1 % tween - 20 ) for 2 min .
finally , the slides were counter - stained with 10 mul of dapi containing anti - fade ( vector laboratories , burlingame , ca ) and sealed with a coverslip .
qrt - pcr huvecs were washed twice with cold calcium - and magnesium - free pbs .
total rna was extracted with the rneasy plus mini kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) , and each sample was treated with turbo dnase ( ambion , grand island , ny ) .
rna was quantified with an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca ) .
samples with an rna integrity number ( rin ) of 10 were used to produce cdna .
although in a typical in vitro experiment rin value varies between 7.5 and 10 , in the current study we used samples with rin value 10 to ensure reproducibility and accuracy of the gene expression study .
cdna was generated from 2 mug of rna using the high - capacity cdna reverse transcription kit ( applied biosystems , carlsbad , ca ) .
qrt - pcr was performed with the abi prism 7000 sequence detection system ( applied biosystems ) .
standard real - time pcr ( 50degreesc for 2 min ; 95degreesc for 10 min ; 50 cycles of 95degreesc for 15 s , 60degreesc for 60 s ) was performed with taqman 2x universal pcr master mix ( applied biosystems ) .
relative mrna expression was calculated with the comparative ct method ( 2 - incrementincrementct ) and normalized to 18s rrna for each sample .
statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed with graphpad software ( la jolla , ca ) .
for experiments with only one parameter under consideration , p values were determined by an unpaired student 's t test .
the standard error for cas was calculated by sqrta / a , where a was the number of aberration under consideration and a was the total number of cells analyzed ( 22 ) .
z tests were used to test differences in the frequency of cas before and after exposure to ir , as described elsewhere ( 23 ) .
results were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05 .
results gt3 suppresses radiation - induced dsb formation in primary human endothelial cells because gt3 has strong antioxidant properties and protects endothelial cells from radiation damage ( 15,17 ) , we proposed that gt3 pretreatment would suppress radiation - induced dsbs in huvecs .
to determine whether gt3 was able to suppress dsbs in huvecs , we assayed the formation of gamma - h2ax foci as an indicator of dsbs after irradiation .
previous gene expression profiling study from our group show that gt3 treatment for 24 h substantially alters genetic pathways known to be of critically important in the regulation of cellular responses of radiation exposure , including the responses to dna damage stimuli in huvecs ( 18 ) .
however , a recent study demonstrate gt3 treatment for 1 h considerably suppresses akt phosphorylation , another critical marker of dsbs formation , in huvecs ( 24 ) .
therefore , we decided to treat huvecs with gt3 either for 1 h or 24 h to assess its ability to modify radiation - induced gammah2ax foci formation .
huvecs were treated with either 5 mum gt3 or vehicle ( dmso ) 24 h before irradiation with 0.2 gy of gamma - rays .
gamma - h2ax foci were quantified by microscopy 1 h after irradiation ( a low dose of radiation was used to minimize counting error ) .
gamma - h2ax foci were almost undetectable in non - irradiated cells treated with vehicle or gt3 ( fig. 1a i , ii , b ) .
irradiation induced gamma - h2ax foci in both the vehicle - ( 3.8 +/ - 0.07 ) and gt3 - treated groups ( 2.7 +/ - 0.23 ) but the gt3 - treated cells contained significantly ( p = 0.01 ) fewer gamma - h2ax foci ( fig. 1a iii , vi , b ) .
further , to determine the ability of gt3 in suppressing residual dsbs that are persisted several hours after irradiation , we treated huvecs with 5 mum of gt3 for 1 h , then exposed to two different radiation doses 3 gy and 5 gy , and further incubated for 29 h before immunofluorescence staining for gammah2ax foci .
we observed gt3 also effectively suppressed frequency of persistent dsb formation in primary human endothelial cells after 3 gy ( 3.4 +/ - 0.19 in vehicle treated group vs 2.0 +/ - 0.46 in gt3 treated group ) and 5 gy ( 4.4 +/ - 0.31 in vehicle treated group vs 3.2 +/ - 0.23 in gt3 treated group ) irradiation ( fig. 1c ). fig. 1 gt3 decreases the number of radiation - induced gamma - h2ax foci ( red ) in huvec nuclei ( dapi stain , blue ) .
( a ) huvecs were treated with ( i ) vehicle ( veh , dmso ) for 24 h or ( ii ) 5 mum gt3 for 24 h without irradiation , or ( iii ) pretreated with vehicle or ( iv ) 5 mum gt3 24 h before 0.2 gy irradiation .
images were taken 1 h after irradiation .
( b ) data from ( a ) are expressed as gamma - h2ax foci per cell for each treatment .
( c ) to determine the efficacy of gt3 in suppressing persistent dsbs , huvecs were treated with gt3 or vehicle for 1 h , exposed to 0 , 3 and 5 gy of radiation and further incubated for 29 h before gammah2ax immunofluorescence staining .
at least 200 nuclei were counted per treatment group .
the data are presented as the mean +/ - sem of 3 to 6 independent assays and p values were determined by an unpaired student 's t test .
gt3 decreases chromosomal aberrations in irradiated primary human endothelial cells next , we asked whether gt3 pretreatment could decrease cas in irradiated endothelial cells .
huvecs were irradiated with 5 gy , and cas were visualized with giemsa staining and mfish analysis with probes specific for human chromosomes 1 , 2 , and 3 .
cas were scored as chromatid - type breaks , sister chromatid unions , chromatid - type exchanges , dicentric and ring chromosomes , double minutes , and chromosome - type breaks .
the percentage of radiation - induced cas was lower in huvecs pretreated with gt3 ( 115.6 +/ - 13.4 ) than in the vehicle - treated group ( 176.3 +/ - 15.2 ) , as detected by giemsa staining ( table i ) .
likewise , the number of radiation - induced cas in chromosomes 1 , 2 , and , 3 was lower in huvecs pretreated with gt3 ( 90.5 +/ - 11.1 ) than in the vehicle - treated group ( 128.4 +/ - 10.5 ) ( table ii ) .
thus , gt3 effectively decreased dsbs and cas in huvecs .

mice were administered gt3 ( 100 mul at dose of 200 mg / kg ) subcutaneously 24 h before 3 gy of total - body irradiation , and bone marrow mononuclear cells were collected 24 h or 30 days after irradiation .
we used a relatively lower dose ( 3 gy ) for the in vivo study than for the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay ( 5 gy ) because lymphocytes are more radiosensitive than huvecs .
giemsa staining detected cas in mouse bone marrow cells 24 h after irradiation ( fig. 2b , arrows ) , compared to the non - irradiated control ( fig. 2a ) .
however , gt3 suppressed cas in the irradiated bone marrow cells both 24 h ( p = 0.0001 ) and 30 days ( p = 0.007 ) after irradiation ( fig. 2c ) .
gt3 treatment also significantly ( p < 0.01 ) decreased radiation - induced cas involving mouse chromosomes 1 , 2 , and 3 24 h after irradiation ( fig. 3 ) .
thus , gt3 effectively decreased cas in vivo for up to 30 days after total - body irradiation. fig. 2 gt3 decreases radiation - induced cas in mouse bone marrow cells .
cas were assayed by giemsa solid staining in mouse bone marrow metaphase spreads from ( a ) non - irradiated ( b ) or irradiated mice ( cas indicated by arrows ) .
( c ) mice ( n = 3 ) were pretreated with vehicle or gt3 ( 200 mg / kg ) 24 h before 3 gy of total body irradiation .
cas were scored in 200 - 600 metaphase spreads 24 h and 30 days after irradiation .

an unpaired t test was performed to determine p values. fig. 3 gt3 decreases radiation - induced cas in mouse chromosomes 1 ( red ) , 2 ( green ) , and 3 ( blue ) .
cas were assayed by mfish in metaphase spreads from ( a ) non - irradiated or ( b ) irradiated mice ( cas indicated by arrows ) .
( c ) mice ( n = 3 ) were pretreated with vehicle or gt3 ( 200 mg / kg ) 24 h before 3 gy of total - body irradiation and pooled bone marrow samples were assayed by mfish .
cas were scored in 100 - 300 metaphase spreads and the standard error was calculated by sqrta / a as described in materials and method section .
gt3 increases rad50 expression because gt3 decreased the incidence of dsbs in vitro , we reasoned that gt3 may affect expression of the dsb - repair protein rad50 .
rad50 expression in gt3 - treated huvecs was roughly two - fold higher than in vehicle - treated cells ( fig. 4 ) .
irradiation is known to decrease rad50 expression , and this was , indeed , the case for both gt3 - and vehicle - treated cells ( fig. 4 ) ; however , gt3 maintained rad50 expression at a level similar to that observed in non - irradiated , vehicle - treated controls ( fig. 4 ) .
these findings suggest that gt3 restricts radiation - induced cytogenetic damage , possibly by modulating rad50 expression. fig. 4 gt3 modulates rad50 expression .
huvecs were treated with vehicle or gt3 ( 5 mum ) for 1 h before 0 gy and 5 gy irradiation , cells were further incubated for 23 h before harvest .
rad50 mrna was measured relative to 18s rrna with taqman assay .
the data are presented as the mean +/ - sd of three independent assays .
discussion radiation generates ros that often cause dsbs .
studies from various groups , including our own , suggest that gt3 detoxifies ros , thereby expecting it to reduce dsb formation .
here , we demonstrate that gt3 suppresses dsb formation in irradiated huvecs .
specifically , gt3 reduced the number of gamma - h2ax foci , a strong indicator of dsbs , by roughly 29 % in huvecs .
we suggest several mechanisms to explain these findings .
gt3 may regulate mitochondrial activity , transcription factors , or endothelial cell surface receptors .
for example , gt3 alleviates ros by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction in primary rabbit renal tubular cells exposed to tert - butyl hydroperoxide ( 25 ). with respect to transcription factors , gt3 decreases ros in human oral keratinocytes exposed to chemotherapy by stabilizing nrf2 activation .
nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates cellular antioxidant pathways ( 26 ) .
further , we recently demonstrated that gt3 increases the expression and activity of the endothelial surface receptor thrombomodulin ( tm ) ( 27 ) .
the lectin - like domain of tm activates nrf2 - dependent antioxidant pathways , substantially decreasing serum and renal ros levels in a mouse model of type - 2 diabetic nephropathy ( 28 ) .
moreover , tm forms a complex with the coagulation factor thrombin to generate activated protein c ( apc ) in the blood ( 29 ) .
among its many properties , apc prevents glucose - induced oxidative stress in endothelial cells ( 30 ) .
thus , our data indicate that gt3 protects huvecs from ros - mediated dsbs , and it may do so in a number of ways .
improperly repaired dsbs induce cas that are visible in metaphase chromosomes .
we found that gt3 decreases cas in both irradiated huvecs and primary mouse bone marrow cells .
it is not entirely clear how gt3 protects cells from induction of cas after radiation exposure , but we offer one possible explanation .
gt3 induces the production of granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( g - csf ) in mice ( 31 ) and evidence suggests that g - csf reduces chromosomal translocations in patients with cancer ( 32 ) .
specifically , g - csf prevented translocations between the long arms of chromosomes 8 and 21 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( 32 ) .
the role of g - csf may not be so straightforward , however .
g - csf was shown to cause aneuploidy in healthy individuals ( 33 ) , although a separate study found no such evidence ( 34 ) .
regardless of the specific mechanisms involved , data suggest that various vitamin e isoforms , including gt3 , protect against cytogenetic damage in humans .
for example , alpha - tocopherol decreases the frequency of chromatid - type breaks and sister chromatid exchanges in lymphocytes from people with fanconi anemia ( 35,36 ) .
similarly , alpha - tocopherol decreases the accumulation of cas during g2 phase in down 's syndrome patients ( 37 ) .
finally , a commercially available , tocotrienol - rich vitamin e derivative decreases sister chromatid exchanges in elderly human subjects ( 38 ) .
thus , multiple vitamin e isoforms could be used to prevent radiation - induced cytogenetic damage in endothelial cell .
finally , intracellular dna - repair enzymes are critically important for repairing cytogenetic damage .
radiation damage activates the cellular dna - repair machinery that identifies dsbs and recruits dna - repair proteins .
previously , we found that gt3 modulates as many as 27 gene clusters in huvecs involved in dna damage ( 18 ) .
here , we show that gt3 increases rad50 expression and attenuates the radiation - induced suppression of rad50 .
these findings corroborate a previous study by li et al. that demonstrated that rad50 expression was suppressed for up to 48 h in mouse white blood cells after 8 - gy irradiation ( 7 ) .
experimental evidence suggests that not only is rad50 required for efficient dna repair after irradiation ( 39 ) but also that its deficiency makes early embryonic cells hypersensitive to ir ( 40 ) .
conclusion the present studies demonstrate that gt3 pretreatment decreases radiation - induced dsb and ca formation in huvecs .
gt3 also reduces acute and delayed cas in irradiated mice and increases rad50 expression in huvecs .
we conclude that gt3 suppresses radiation - induced cytogenetic damage and possibly gt3 - mediated alteration in rad50 expression plays some role in limiting cytogenetic damage after radiation ; however , further investigation is required to determine whether gt3 regulates additional dna - repair proteins .
gt3 may , therefore , be a useful therapeutic to protect against radiation - induced genetic diseases .

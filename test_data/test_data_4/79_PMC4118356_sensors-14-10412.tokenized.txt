in this paper , we propose a new haptic - assisted virtual cane system operated by a simple finger pointing gesture .
the system is developed by two stages : development of visual information delivery assistant ( vida ) with a stereo camera and adding a tactile feedback interface with dual actuators for guidance and distance feedbacks .
in the first stage , user 's pointing finger is automatically detected using color and disparity data from stereo images and then a 3d pointing direction of the finger is estimated with its geometric and textural features .
finally , any object within the estimated pointing trajectory in 3d space is detected and the distance is then estimated in real time .
for the second stage , identifiable tactile signals are designed through a series of identification experiments , and an identifiable tactile feedback interface is developed and integrated into the vida system .
our approach differs in that navigation guidance is provided by a simple finger pointing gesture and tactile distance feedbacks are perfectly identifiable to the blind .
finger pointing gestures 3d pointing direction estimation obstacle detection stereo camera system human computer interaction tactile feedback virtual cane 1 .
introduction the role of the white cane , a mechanical device , is an extended - hand like guidance for the better mobility that guarantees safe and comfortable movements .
it is helpful for the blind to avoid obstacles and to negotiate his / her steps , and to follow the safest walking trajectory while in motion .
over decades , the stick - look cane has been recognized as a commonly used tool for people who are blind or visually impaired as compared to guide dogs that cost more .
despite the popularity of the white cane , it has drawbacks such as a long training time , a limited sensible range ( e.g. , only usable within 1 - 2 m ) , uncomfortable carrying and contact - based object detection. from a technical point of view , the virtual cane system can be separated into two main parts : sensing obstacles and providing feedbacks to avoid the detected obstacles .
literally , sensors play a crucial role in sensing obstacles and these days high - tech sensors like ultrasound and lidar have been used as new approaches [ 1 - 3 ] .
nonetheless , those sensors have tradeoffs in terms of accuracy , cost and portableness , and so camera sensors have been considered as the best option due to the unique benefits such as low cost , non - contact object detection , precise shape reconstruction , and computational efficiency .
these benefits have been also proved by researchers [ 4,5 ] who demonstrated that utilizing vision sensors benefit the blind to explore visual environments efficiently under dynamic scenes in various applications .
recently , stereo camera based approaches have been introduced by several researchers .
jose et al .
[ 6 ] developed a virtual cane system by using a stereo camera , and successfully showed the effectiveness as a wearable system customized for assisting navigation under unknown environments .
fernandes et al .
[ 7 ] proposed a robust stereo vision algorithm extracting predefined landmarks like circles that provide cues for safe walking .
as a hybrid system , brilhault et al .
[ 8 ] combined stereo vision and a gps system to improve user 's positioning .
an assistance system that can guide user 's orientation to locate objects has been developed by dramas et al .
[ 5 ] .
denis et al .
[ 9 ] developed a wearable virtual cane system that can detect objects coming close to the user .
additionally , they designed distinct sound feedbacks for the estimated distance to the detected objects .
although many interesting systems have been developed until now , most of the systems are passive or workable only under some conditions like known environments and predefined landmarks .
these limitations could be barriers to design a natural user interface .
for a natural user interface , vision based hand gesture and finger pointing technologies have been actively developed by many researchers [ 10 - 14 ] since those are non - intrusive , convenient , and interactive .
especially , 3d range data based gesture recognition is highly reliable and robust to be a practical use as demonstrated in many game applications with the kinect .
the effectiveness of using 3d depth images for finger gesture recognition has also been corroborated by matikainen et al. and nickel et al .
[ 13,15 ] who developed robust pointing gesture technologies for interactive visual scene analyses .
these pointing gesture technologies provide users with benefits in that the user 's hand can become free from holding a sensing device and the user is interactively able to get accurate information of a place where he / she wants to explore in advance .
in general , developing finger pointing recognition technologies is threefold : finger detection and tracking , estimation of finger pointing directions , and obstacle 's detection .
first , detecting and tracking fingers with wearable cameras is not simple due to human motions and noisy backgrounds .
as pioneering work , several researchers [ 16 - 18 ] introduced hand detection and tracking algorithms with simplified conditions like uniform backgrounds or wearing color gloves .
afterward , many researchers put a lot of effort into improving bare hand tracking technologies on cluttered backgrounds for sign language applications [ 19,20 ] and for human computer interactions [ 21 ] .
in our work , a dynamic update model for moving backgrounds was proposed to compensate background changes caused by motions from body worn cameras .
second , with the detected pointing finger , estimating an accurate 3d finger pointing direction can be achieved by using classic theories in stereo vision [ 22 ] , multiple view geometry [ 23 ] , and stereo camera calibration [ 24,25 ] .
in our study , we utilized the existing theory to estimate a 3d pointing direction with disparity data obtained from a stereo camera .
compared with the previous steps , detecting obstacles is a challenging problem since algorithms should be able to detect obstacles even in complex surroundings as humans naturally do. to detect objects accurately , segmentations that intelligently extract target objects under dynamic scenes are extremely important .
as a new algorithm , we developed a robust segmentation algorithm which is suitable for the virtual cane system .
in order to deliver the visual scene information to the blind user , providing feedbacks via sounds and / or vibration is effective .
however , audible feedback often becomes noise or even can mask important information such as traffic sounds and other people 's talk on street .
for this reason , tactile feedback is preferably developed as a non - intrusive interface with vision systems .
as the first work , pressey [ 26 ] developed a lightweight hand - held device called mowat sensor to be easily carried while walking .
the sensor itself detected an object within a beam of high frequency sounds and vibrated for tactile feedback with predefined vibrations ( e.g. , the higher frequency is interpreted as a closer obstacle ) .
etran et al .
[ 27 ] invented a wearable navigation system based on a haptic directional display embedded in the back of a vest .
directional cues were generated differently like lines , circles and blinking to inform directional cues .
velazquez et al .
[ 28 ] introduced a concept of intelligent glasses with tactile feedback .
a dynamic edge shape extracted from a stereo camera was directly transmitted to a tactile display , a braille built with push up / down mechanical sticks representing the edge shape .
a shortcoming of the system was that user 's hand had to be placed on the haptic display device all the time to feel tactile feedbacks .
as recent work , hirose and amemiya [ 29 ] developed a prototype with a pda ( personal digital assistant ) device .
for tactile feedback , three vibrating motors attached to the user 's arms ( left and right ) and back .
direction cues were delivered to the user by vibrations on single or double motors , while the number of pulses of the vibrations was used for distance cues .
however , none of the existing tactile feedback systems did design identifiable feedback signals based on human perceptions but instead intuitively selected vibration signals .
in our work , we designed perfectly identifiable tactile signals by conducting a series of identification experiments and those signals were successfully integrated in our virtual cane system .
in this paper , we focus on presenting a robust and advanced distance estimation system with a stereo camera that is operated by a simple finger pointing gesture .
additionally , we propose a complete virtual cane solution by integrating a tactile feedback interface that employs perceptually identifiable frequencies , obtained from 1d frequency identification experiments for distance - matching tactile feedbacks .
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .
in section 2 , we describe the visual information delivery system , and the experimental results are presented in section 3 .
section 4 explains how we designed identifiable tactile feedback signals and integrated the tactile feedback system with the visual information delivery system .
conclusions and future work are provided in section 5 .
2. visual information delivery assistant ( vida ) the visual information delivery assistant ( vida ) consists of three steps : hand detection , estimation of a 3d pointing direction , object detection and distance calculation .
the flow chart of the algorithm is shown in figure 1 .
2.1 .
hand detection as earlier mentioned , extracting hands or a finger in a complex scene is not easy .
the problem even becomes severe if images are taken from a fluctuated camera , which is the case of wearable virtual cane systems .
to tackle the challenging problem , we combine static and dynamic segmentation methods to improve hand region detection .
hand and finger regions are then detected by using skin color information .
in the following , detailed algorithms are explained .
2.1.1 .
background subtraction under dynamic scenes background subtraction provides a fundamental framework for hand area detection in both static and dynamic environments .
in our algorithm , we made a fusion framework that adaptively utilizes static and dynamic background subtraction methods .
for this approach , we define a static background as an image frame whose variations are relatively small , while a dynamic background is an image frame that has big global variations ( e.g. , the entire scene is changed ) .
to implement the static background subtraction , we adopted a learning average method , a well - known statistical method , to build a background model .
the method basically creates a background model based on the mean difference computed from a set of accumulated image frames .
then , subsequent frames are subtracted from the created background model , which results in segmentation .
this simple approach enables the quick detection of a moving hand in a static environment .
for taking advantage of the static background subtraction approach in dynamic scenes , we introduce a strategy that makes our system intelligently works well under dynamic environments .
the strategy includes continuous dynamic model updates and detecting global scene changes to trigger building a new background model .
the former develops an extended version of static background subtraction by replacing the static background model with the most up - to - date background model that is captured from dynamic scenes .
in other words , any dynamic scene captured at time t can be considered to be a new static background model for hand segmentation under dynamic environments .
this approach works well for both static and dynamic background subtraction .
however , one issue here is how to let our system know the update timing for a new background model when the stereo camera is in motion .
in our observation , two typical types of global changes were found in a dynamic environment : changes by the moving camera and local changes by moving objects .
the latter must be excluded for updating the model .
this is why our strategy includes detecting global scene changes .
for this , we developed a decision maker algorithm that compares local variations within predefined window blocks to determine whether the global scene was changed or not .
a threshold value was defined by our pilot study for the criterion .
the sum of local variations is compared with the threshold .
for instance , the greater value is the case of global scene changes that result in creating a new background model , while the opposite case updates the background model locally from the previous model .
during this process , the hand region is not updated .
figure 2 shows how the background model is updated against camera motions and a moving object ( the user 's arm ) .
for efficient processing , the input image ( 320 x 240 pixels ) was divided into 8 by 6 blocks ( 40 x 40 pixels ) .
for each block , our decision maker algorithm was run to determine whether a new global background model should be created .
if more than half pixels in each block show variations , the block is categorized as a block to be updated .
the background model is then updated with the eight nearest neighbors of the block .
in our approach , both a color background model and a depth background model are updated except the foreground region of a skin - colored hand area for the next process .
2.1.2 .
hand detection using color segmentation with the detected region including the user 's arm , the hand region is identified by skin - color information .
two color spaces , yuv and yiq , are used together for creating a unique classifier for color segmentation in our approach .
our classifier was designed to take two feature parameters from the two color spaces ( i.e. , one from each ) .
the reason why we have chosen the specific color models is that both models are sensitive to low color depths ( image bandwidth ) like human visual perception .
it is also known that yuv and yiq have the same luminance component but different coordinate systems for chrominance components .
for generating feature parameters with the yuv model , luminance ( y ) and two chrominance components ( u and v ) are computed from the rgb space by the transformation matrix below : ( 1 ) [ yuv ]=[ 0.2990.5870.114 - 0.147 - 0.2890.4360.615 - 0.515 - 0.100 ][ rgb ] the computed u and v values are then used for computing two feature parameters , a displacement vector ( c ) and the phase angle ( theta ) , that can be used for color segmentation .
those features are computed as follows : ( 2 ) c =| u | 2 +| v | 2andtheta = tan - 1 ( v / u ) in the yiq color space , i and q , representing chrominance values , can also be used as features .
obtaining these values from rgb is achieved by the transformation matrix : ( 3 ) [ yiq ]=[ 0.2990.5870.1140.596 - 0.274 - 0.322 - 0.212 - 0.5230.311 ][ rgb ] a combination of the four feature values , c , theta , i and q , can create a unique criterion that can accurately segment human hands .
therefore those values can be tuned up to the aiming level of segmentation .
in our application , we used only two features , theta and i. the ranges of optimized values used for hand segmentation are 105 to 150 and 15 to 100 , respectively .
after detecting the skin colored area with these color features , noises were completely eliminated by using a connected component analysis .
the upper row of figure 3 shows this segmentation procedure using the two feature values .
2.2 .
estimation of 3d pointing direction a pointing gesture with fingers generally forms a particular hand shape created by a combination of convex and concave shapes .
we utilize this phenomenon to estimate the finger pointing direction in 2d space based on a shape analysis , and the estimated direction is then extended to three dimensions using the existing camera geometry we further present these two steps in the following .
a pointing direction in 2d space is estimated by taking three steps , as seen in the lower row of figure 3 : extracting the hand contour , finding a convex polygon on the extracted contour , and estimating an accurate pointing vector .
in order to extract a precise hand contour , the polygonal approximation is applied because of its robustness to illuminations .
the extracted contour is then verified by a convex hull algorithm that finds both convex vertex points and convex defects ( concave ) .
the process of examining convexity is as follows : considering two points , a and b in a region omega , the convexity can be evaluated by the following measure : ( 4 ) v = alphaa + betabfor 0 < alpha , beta < 1 and alpha + beta = 1 .
if all possible v are in the region omega for arbitrary values of alpha and beta , then the contour from a to b is convex .
this way , a convex polygon and convexity defects are generated as the output .
as the last step , an accurate 2d pointing direction is estimated by taking two steps , an initial estimate and the refinement process , with the filtered hand contour ( figure 3d ) and a hand shape polygon ( cyan colored lines in figure 3e ) formed from finger tips and convexity .
an initial direction is roughly determined from a bounding rectangle of the hand contour , a blue box in figure 3e. that is , the longer side of the rectangle becomes a unit vector , a blue arrow in figure 3f , of the 2d pointing direction at the geometric center of the hand .
the initial pointing direction is then refined towards the index finger by the principle vector of the hand shape polygon ( see the longer red line inside the hand shape contour in figure 3e ) .
the finally estimated 2d pointing direction is visualized as a red arrow superimposed on the hand image in figure 3f .
to estimate the corresponding 3d pointing vector , intrinsic parameters computed from the camera calibration are used .
in theory , 3d points on a 3d pointing vector from the corresponding 2d points are obtained as follows : ( 5 ) z = fdb,x = ufz,y = vfzwhere a 3d point is denoted by a vector ( x , y , z ) from the origin in the camera coordinates , f is the focal length of the camera , b is the baseline distance of a stereo camera , d is the disparity value at any location , and ( u , v ) is a location on the 2d image .
figure 4 graphically shows how a 3d pointing direction is estimated from a 2d pointing direction .
2.3 .
object detection in the vida system , any object inside region of interest ( roi ) extracted by user 's pointing gesture is detected as an obstacle .
the actual distance to the detected object is accurately computed with the stereo camera geometry that provides transformation between 2d and 3d spaces .
in the following , the specific algorithms , classification of 3d points and roi extraction , are presented .
2.3.1 .
classification of 3d points given a 3d pointing vector estimated in the previous step , a line passing through any two points in 3d space can be simply obtained in homogeneous coordinates [ 23 ] .
for simplicity 's sake , we do classify 3d points of object candidates in 2d image planes ( x - z and y - z projected planes ) instead of 3d space. by doing so , the computational cost , required for distance computing between 3d points and a 3d line ( e.g. , a finger pointing vector ) , has been greatly reduced .
the classification algorithm therefore works as follows .
first , the line ( l ) between two 2d points ( p1 , p2 ) as projected to a 2d plane is computed by the cross product of the two points , ( 6 ) l = p1xp2where l , p1 , p2 in r3 are represented in the homogeneous coordinates .
second , using equation ( 5 ) , all pixels in a 2d image are mapped to the corresponding 3d points by the stereo camera geometry ( or called two view geometry ) .
each 3d point is then classified into two groups ( class of interest ( ci ) and class of non - interest ( cni )) by the measured distance in the x - z and y - z image planes .
the orthogonal distance from a point to a line is obtained by the dot product : ( 7 ) l.p = dwhere l , p in r3 in the homogeneous coordinates and d is a scalar. with a fixed value of d ( orthogonal distance ) , a virtual cylinder is formed as shown in figure 5 and its boundary , defined by d , becomes the classifier of 3d points .
based on this configuration , any 3d point inside the virtual cylinder falls into the class of interest ( ci ) , and otherwise belongs to the class of non - interest ( cni ) .
then , all points in ci are back - projected onto the corresponding 2d image plane , and the region becomes a roi candidate for object detection .
this transformation between 2d image coordinates and 3d camera coordinates is illustrated in figure 5 .
note that in the figure a smile face pictogram represents the center of the camera coordinate system .
2.3.2 .
roi extraction and object detection as outcomes in the previous step , roi candidates were generated on the image plane from 3d points .
however , it was observed that roi candidates are not correctly generated in case of disparity errors ( noise or lack of data ) as seen in figure 6 .
these problems are mainly caused by illumination changes and errors in computing disparity values .
to fix the problems , 3d disparity noises are filtered first , and then the way of classification of 3d points is slightly modified from the previous .
as seen in figure 7 , 3d points are classified by using two virtual rectangles projected from the virtual cylinder onto the x - z and y - z planes respectively .
in last to extract the final roi candidate , the classified 3d points in the roi interest group are projected onto the image plane in which two perpendicular bars are formed .
the intersection of the two bars ( yellow and pink ) shown in figure 8 is chosen as the final roi .
the white region in figure 8a is the roi candidate determined by the virtual cylinder only .
in our vida system , the final roi can be visually magnified for the user to perceive the details ( texture information ) of the detected objects .
the magnification of the roi is performed using the bilinear interpolation method .
the bilinear interpolation performs a linear interpolation in one direction first and then repeats it for the other direction .
the resulting images by the roi extraction and magnification are shown in figure 8 .
3. experimental results of vida the vida system shown in figure 9 consists of a commercial stereo camera ( bumblebee 2 manufactured by pointgrey inc. , richmond , bc , canada ) , a personal computer ( intel core2 2.2g hz and 2g ram ) and a standard lcd ( liquid - crystal dispaly ) monitor .
the system runs at 6 frames per second with an input qvga ( quarter video graphics array , 320 x 240 pixels ) image .
the spatial accuracy , reported by the manufactured company as the system calibration error , was 5 mm at 1 m distance , which is sufficiently accurate to detect hands and objects for the virtual cane system .
our developed system , vida , was thoroughly verified in terms of accuracy and robustness against illuminations and occlusions .
the evaluation was done systematically , first with each algorithm and then with the whole system .
the results shown in figure 10 show how our hand detection algorithm works well with backgrounds that contain numerous objects .
figure 11 also demonstrates the precise 3d pointing estimation under a dynamic environment .
in the resulting images , the estimated pointing vector colored in red was superimposed onto user 's hand to show the accuracy .
for the system evaluation , we tested vida with various objects that are different in shape , color and size under dynamic scenes .
for this experiment , a user was asked to walk around and make a random pointing gesture to objects .
to evaluate the accuracy , what was pointed by the user has been recorded and compared with the detected object from vida .
the sequential images seen in figure 12 demonstrate the experiment procedure .
as clearly seen in figure 12 , all objects pointed by the user were successfully detected even at long distance ( up to 3 m ) .
the numerical results are summarized in table 1 .
for a more accurate evaluation with the ground truth , we used a laser pointer , attached to the top of the index finger , as a tool that can generate the ground truth .
figure 13 shows the experimental setup and the image of pointing target circles .
during the experiment , points marked by laser points on the target image were recorded and compared with pointing points estimated by our algorithm .
geometric errors between the laser points ( ground truth ) and the estimated points were computed and averaged for 40 repetitions per distance , 1 , 2 and 3 m , respectively .
the results were also summarized in table 2 .
additionally , robustness against illuminations and occlusions has been tested .
for the illumination test , three different lighting conditions ( bright , normal , dark ) were used and compared with each other in setting that these lighting conditions are distinguishable on the taken images .
for the evaluation with occlusions , two user scenarios were developed : interferences by extra hands and faces since both cases can significantly affect the performance of our system utilizing skin color information for hand detection .
the results in figure 14 show the robustness of our system against illuminations and occlusions .
4. development of tactile feedback interface for vida in this section , we first describe a frequency identification experiment conducted to choose a set of distinctive tactile signals .
we then present a tactile feedback interface integrated into vida .
4.1 .
finding identifiable frequencies for tactile feedback we designed an identification experiment to find a set of identifiable signals for tactile feedback .
in the design of haptic feedback signal waves , we focused on frequency identification because our hardware setup with a mini piezo driver ( drv8662 , manufactured by texas instrument inc. , dallas , tx , usa ) provides the wider range of responses in frequency than in amplitude .
for the experimental setup , cycle and amplitude were fixed to 3 , 60 vpp , and a square wave , based on user 's preference .
additionally , a square waveform was selected because it delivers the stronger haptic effect than other wave forms ( sinusoidal or sawtooth ) when the same voltage input is given .
we were particularly interested in finding identifiable frequencies on the index finger since the goal of the present study is to develop a virtual cane system that can be operated by a simple pointing gesture .
it is also well known that the index finger is most sensitive to tactile sensation in our body [ 30 ] .
for the identification experiment , a vibrator ( see figure 15a ) for tactile feedback was built with a piezoelectric actuator ( 20 mm diameter , murata manufacturing co. ltd. , nagaokakyo , kyoto , japan ) , and was affixed to a transparent acrylic square cut ( 20 mm long and 2 mm thick ) .
a programmable piezo actuator driver ( drv 8662 evm , texas instrument inc. ) was used to drive the vibrator .
tactile signals were pregenerated with square waves at different frequencies and then sent to the piezo driver automatically , whenever the participant press a key to feel the next test signal .
ten participants ( 4 females and 6 males ; age range 22 - 36 ; no previous haptic experience ; neither visually impaired nor blind ) took part in the identification experiment .
in the experiment , all participants were instructed to put the vibrator on their index finger and took five minute training to get familiar with tactile sensations at different frequencies to be tested .
vibrations with the three frequencies were randomized and presented to each participant one by one at a time .
the participant then had to respond immediately the identification number of the presented frequency by using the keyboard .
a pc ( personal computer ) monitor graphically displayed all necessary information ( questions , trials remained , the elapsed time ) for the participant to follow the procedure until complete the experiment .
in order to obtain unbiased data , a minimum of 50 trials each frequency as suggested by miller [ 31 ] , that makes a minimum of 150 trials in total , was tested for an identification experiment .
the experiment was repeated three times with different sets of frequencies as shown in table 3 with the same participants .
the very first experiment tested whether an initial set of three frequencies ( 10 hz , 100 hz and 300 hz ) are identifiable , and the second experiment was then conducted with a new set of frequencies ( 10 hz , 100 hz and 500 hz ) that was formed by replacing 300 hz with 500 hz after investigating the result of the first experiment .
in the last experiment , a new frequency , 600 hz , was verified instead of 500 hz because the frequency 500 hz was not perfectly identified .
in this way , a final set of identifiable frequencies ( 10 hz , 100 hz and 600 hz ) was found .
table 3 shows the three confusion matrices obtained through the three consecutive identification experiments .
all of the participants completed each experiment in 40 min , and so it took about two hours in total for each participant to complete the entire experiment including a 10 - min break .
4.2 .
design of tactile feedback interface with identifiable frequencies with the result of the frequency identification experiment , we propose a novel tactile feedback interface that can be integrated into the vida system .
our design takes into account both identifiable distance feedback and hand guidance feedback keeping user 's hand to be in the camera 's view of vida .
for the tactile distance feedback , the distance estimated from the vida system is mapped to one of the three identifiable frequencies ( 10 hz , 100 hz and 600 hz ) in table 4 .
for instance , the higher frequency is assigned to the closer distance since users have to take a quicker action to avoid detected obstacles .
on the contrary , the guidance feedback uses the highest frequency ( 600 hz ) since it is provided only when user 's hand is out of the camera view and in general , people perceive signals at higher frequencies as warning signals .
the two signals are delivered to two separate haptic actuators , attached to the index finger for the distance feedback and the wrist for the guidance feedback as an example .
the interpretations are summarized in table 5 .
figure 16 shows how the designed tactile feedback interface can be successfully integrated into the vida system .
the developed tactile feedback interface can also be used for other navigation systems as long as distinctive distance values are provided .
5. conclusions we developed a complete solution of a virtual cane system by combining finger pointing gesture and tactile feedback .
for the development of finger pointing estimation , a novel algorithm that can precisely estimate a 3d finger pointing direction with a stereo camera was proposed .
the proposed algorithm was thoroughly tested under various conditions ( dynamic scenes , different objects , illumination changes and occlusions ) .
the evaluation results show that our developed system ( vida ) is sufficiently robust and provides accurate object detection .
in addition , we designed identifiable tactile signals that can be mapped to distance information estimated by vida .
those signals ( 10 hz , 100 hz , 600 hz ) were selected through identification experiments and were then used for developing a tactile feedback interface .
as the last step , we have demonstrated that the tactile feedback interface can be successfully integrated into vida as a virtual cane system .
our developed visual system provides accurate finger tracking and finger pointing estimation in real - time .
the accuracy and real time performance enable blind people to navigate on street only with a simple finger pointing gesture .
this technology is not only a cost effective solution , but is also extendable for other applications such as finger or hand gesture controls for mobile devices , computer games and vr ( virtual reality ) applications .
towards a complete navigation solution for the blind , we adopted haptic feedback that is an effective way to deliver obstacle 's information under dynamic and noisy environments on street .
unlike other prior work [ 26 - 28 ] , we adopted identifiable tactile signals that were designed by identification experiments .
this approach can benefit researchers or designer who develop human computer interfaces concerning haptic perception .
in last , our system differs in that navigation guidance is given upon user 's simple gesture action ( i.e. , both way interactions ) and our approach is robust under unknown dynamic scenes .
our future work will continue to improve the frame update rate ( 6 hz ) for faster walkers and will also evaluate the proposed virtual cane system by conducting user studies with visually impaired people .
we are also interested in learning more about the possibility of designing tactile signals with other parameters ( amplitudes and complex wave forms ) by conducting more identification and psychophysical experiments .

we report here increased expression of macrophage colony - stimulating - factor - 1 - receptor ( m - csf / csf - 1r ) mrna in mesothelioma versus normal tissue specimens and demonstrate that csf - 1r expression identifies chemoresistant cells of mesothelial nature in both primary cultures and mesothelioma cell lines. by using rnai or ligand trapping , we demonstrate that the chemoresistance properties of those cells depend on autocrine csf - 1r signaling .
at the single - cell level , the isolated csf - 1rpos cells exhibit a complex repertoire of pluripotency , epithelial - mesenchymal transition and detoxifying factors , which define a clonogenic , chemoresistant , precursor - like cell sub - population .
the simple activation of csf - 1r in untransformed mesothelial cells is sufficient to confer clonogenicity and resistance to pemetrexed , hallmarks of mesothelioma .
in addition , this induced a gene expression profile highly mimicking that observed in the mpm cells endogenously expressing the receptor and the ligands , suggesting that csf - 1r expression is mainly responsible for the phenotype of the identified cell sub - populations .
the survival of csf1rpos cells requires active akt ( v - akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ) signaling , which contributed to increased levels of nuclear , transcriptionally competent beta - catenin .
inhibition of akt reduced the transcriptional activity of beta - catenin - dependent reporters and sensitized the cells to senescence - induced clonogenic death after pemetrexed treatment .
this work expands what is known on the non - macrophage functions of csf - 1r and its role in solid tumors , and suggests that csf - 1r signaling may have a critical pathogenic role in a prototypical , inflammation - related cancer such as mpm and therefore may represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention .
m - csf chemoresistance emt mesothelioma transformation the colony - stimulating - factor receptor - 1 ( csf - 1r ) is a type iii receptor tyrosine kinase primarily reported as responsible for the proliferation , differentiation and survival of the monocyte - macrophage cell lineage , as well as their recruitment.1 the two known ligands of csf - 1r are csf - 1 and the structurally unrelated sibling il - 34 ( interleukin - 34 ) .
both csf - 1 and il - 34 function through non - competitive binding to csf - 1r by triggering auto - and transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor,2 which results in the activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) - dependent and ras - activated protein kinase - dependent pathways.3 csf - 1r may function in cancer cells as an oncogene4 by exploiting src - dependent and - independent signaling modalities.5 , 6 in vivo , elevated expression of csf - 1r has been described in tumors of epithelial origin , such as ovarian , endometrial , breast , prostate , renal and ovarian carcinomas , and has also been found to correlate in some cases with adverse prognosis.7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 studies in breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma suggest that autocrine signaling of csf - 1r may be relevant in vivo as well and modulated by oncogenic signaling ( i.e. transforming growth factor - beta1 ( tgfbeta1 ) and egf , respectively ). 11 , 12 malignant pleural mesothelioma ( mpm ) is a neoplastic disease of the pleura with a clear pathogenetic link to chronic inflammation , in most cases due to asbestos exposure.13 a clinically silent progression and an unusually high resistance to therapy make the prognosis of mesothelioma patients almost invariably poor and survival has changed very little in the past 20 years.14 mpm is a clinically relevant model to study the relationships between chronic inflammation and chemoresistance , as asbestos exposure of pleural mesothelial cells induces sustained nuclear factor - kappab ( nf - kappab ) activation15 following activation of high - mobility group box 1 signaling.16 , 17 here we show , for the first time , that expression of the csf - 1r identifies a specific cell sub - population exhibiting pluripotency and chemoresistance in both primary mpm cultures and cell lines .
a specific gene expression profile and autocrine activation of the csf - 1r signaling characterize the functional uniqueness of these cells , which exhibit increased nf - kappab , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( stat3 ) and akt ( v - akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ) activation .
akt activation following the forced activation of csf - 1r signaling in untransformed mesothelial cells confers accelerated growth , clonogenicity and resistance to pemetrexed , and leads to increased nuclear levels of functional beta - catenin .
this phenotype is reversed by inhibition of akt .
this study expands what is known on the function of csf - 1r in non - hematopoietic neoplasms and suggests that interference with the signaling of the csf - 1rpos cells may overcome the chemoresistance of mpm .
results mesothelioma csf - 1rpos cells exist in vivo to investigate whether csf - 1r is expressed in mesothelioma tissues and if its levels are correlated to the tumor state , we performed a microarray expression analysis of 34 matched pair samples of normal peritoneal tissue versus mesotheliomas ( figure 1a ) .
this revealed an increased mrna expression of csf - 1r in the mesothelioma tissue as opposed to the mesothelial tissue ( p < 0.001 ) .
this finding did not exclude that tumor - associated macrophages or bone marrow - derived cells may contribute the observed higher csf - 1r expression in the tumor tissue .
therefore , we developed mesothelioma primary cultures ( n = 7 ) from pleural effusions and solid specimens of mpm patients .
fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) staining revealed that all the mpm specimens contained csf - 1rpos cells shortly after harvesting ( t = 2 - 18 h ) .
staining of the same samples after long - term culturing ( 2.2 +/ - 1.1 months : average length of the culture ) revealed that the percentage of csf - 1rpos cells was almost unchanged or slightly increased in time ( figure 1b ) .
costaining with anti - calretinin antibodies indicated that a relatively large fraction of the csf - 1rpos cells within the primary cell cultures expressed the mesothelioma - specific antigen calretinin,18 thus confirming the mesothelial nature of the csf - 1rpos cells ( figure 1c ) .
finally , we assessed the levels of csf - 1 and il - 34 , the known ligands for csf - 1r , in the conditioned medium of the primary cultures ( t = 45 - 60 ) .
enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) assay revealed that both csf - 1r ligands were represented in the medium of the primary cultures ( in 7 / 7 cultures and 6 / 7 cultures for csf - 1 and il - 34 , respectively ) ( figure 1d ) .
the absence , at day 60 of culture , of detectable , surviving hematopoietic cells ( lymphocytes , monocytes , eosinophils and neutrophils ) , as judged by the absence of cd3 - , cd14 - , cd16 - , cd19 - , cd20 - , cd56 - and cd45 - positive cells within the csf - 1rpos cell fraction ( supplementary figure 1 ) , suggested that mesothelial csf - 1rpos cells could be responsible for the production of the csf - 1r ligands .
mpm cell lines secrete csf - 1 and il - 34 and express functional csf - 1r to obtain a suitable experimental system to study the csf - 1r function in mesothelioma cells , we analyzed the expression of csf - 1r and its ligands csf - 1 and il - 34 in a panel of mesothelioma cell lines and an untransformed mesothelial cell line immortalized by h - tert ( lp9 ) ( figure 2 ) .
facs analysis showed that all the mesothelioma cell lines contained a small sub - population of csf - 1rpos cells ( range 2 - 13 %) .
a small percentage of lp9 cells exhibiting the expression of csf - 1r (< 1.5 %) was also present in the mesothelial cells ( lp9 ) ( figure 2a ) .
next , elisa assay revealed that 7 / 7 mesothelioma cell lines secreted il - 34 and 6 / 7 mpm cell lines secreted csf - 1 , with the levels of il - 34 being generally higher than those of csf - 1 ( figure 2b ) .
no detectable il - 34 and very little csf - 1 was produced by the untransformed mesothelial lp9 cells ( figure 2b ) .
thus , mesothelioma cell lines expressed all the components of the csf - 1r signaling module , implying active signaling in those cells .
to verify this , we treated h - 2595 cells with vehicle ( phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs )) , csf - 1 ( 25 ng / ml ) or il - 34 ( 25 ng / ml ) .
this revealed increased csf - 1r autophosphorylation , as assessed by western blotting with phospho - csf - 1r ( tyr723 ) antibodies ( figure 2c , upper panel ) in the cytokine - treated cells .
this correlated with a strong increase of the csf - 1rpos cells in the ligand - treated samples , as assessed by facs ( figure 2c , lower panel ) .
next , we observed a dose - dependent increase of the formed colonies in the csf - 1 - and il - 34 - treated cells , which matched the increase of csf - 1rpos cells observed in figure 2c ( figure 2d , upper and lower panel ) .
to prove that the increased clonogenicity was specifically due to csf - 1 and il - 34 binding , we treated h - 2595 cells with a truncated csf - 1r containing the extracellular domain ( ecd ) , shown to bind to and sequester both csf - 1 and il - 34.19 this affected the clonogenicity of the cells in a dose - dependent manner .
no effect of the control ( bovine serum albumin ( bsa )) treatment was observed ( figure 2e and inset ) .
we performed identical observations with the h - 2373 cells ( supplementary figures 2a - c ) .
csf - 1r signaling mediates resistance to pemetrexed of mpm cell lines and primary samples the previous observations suggested that active csf - 1r signaling may transduce prosurvival signals ( figure 3 ) .
therefore , we investigated the involvement of the csf - 1r / csf - 1 / il - 34 system in mediating the resistance of the mesothelioma cells to pemetrexed .
first , we observed a significant increase of the csf - 1 and il - 34 mrna in the cells treated with pemetrexed for 48 h , which matched the increased secretion of the two cytokines in the medium ( figure 3a ) .
next , facs staining revealed that the csf - 1rpos cells survived pemetrexed treatment , with no decrease or increase of the receptor - positive cells in the surviving cell fraction ( figures 3b and c ) .
this was not observed in the pemetrexed - treated mesothelial lp9 cells ( figure 3c ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
next , we transduced h - 2595 and h - 2373 cells with two independent csf - 1r - targeting shrnas ( out of four tested ) , which largely reduced the expression of csf1r , as demonstrated by western blotting ( figure 3d ) .
csf - 1r downregulation affected the viability of both control ( vehicle ) - and pemetrexed - treated cells ( figure 3e and supplementary figure 2d ) .
a similar effect was observed on the clonogenicity of the same cells either when treated with vehicle or with increasing concentrations of pemetrexed ( figure 3f and supplementary figure 2e ) .
although csf - 1r downregulation affected the viability and clonogenicity of both control ( vehicle ) - and pemetrexed - treated cells , its action on the pemetrexed - treated cells was much stronger , consistent with a chemosensitizing effect .
to broaden the relevance of these findings , we assessed whether csf - 1rpos mesothelioma cells in primary cultures would exhibit similar behavior .
when challenged with pemetrexed , all the primary cultures ( n = 7 ) exhibited surviving csf - 1rpos cells , whose number did not significantly change upon treatment ( figure 3g ) .
viability of purified csf1rpos cells from two representative primary cultures was affected by treatment with the csf - 1r decoy ( ecd ) and further reduced by pemetrexed treatment ( figure 3h ) .
these observations suggest that , like in the cell lines , the csf - 1r expression in primary mpm specimens identifies a chemoresistant cell population sensitive to csf - 1r inhibition , emphasizing the potential for csf - 1r signaling to impinge on the chemoresistance of mesothelioma cells .
facs - sorted csf - 1rpos cells exhibit a distinct gene expression profile we investigated whether the repertoire of gene expression exhibited by the csf - 1rpos cells could explain their properties ( figure 4 ) .
in detail , we evaluated whether facs - purified , csf - 1rpos h - 2595 cells would differ from their unsorted counterparts with regard to the expression of pluripotency markers and chemoresistance - associated genes .
quantitative reverse - transcription pcr ( qrt - pcr ) analysis revealed enrichment of the csf - 1rpos cells for the expression of nanog , oct4 , sox2 , endoglin , c - myc and notch1 mrnas .
we also found very high levels of atp - binding cassette transporters , subfamily g , member 2 ( abcg2 ) mrna , a membrane drug transporter whose increased expression confers chemoresistant features.20 , 21 epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) genes , such as vimentin , fbn , matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( mmp - 9 ) and cd44 , and chief emt modulators , such as snai1 , snai2 and tgf - beta1 , were also enriched in csf - 1rpos cells .
we also found that the csf - 1rpos cells were enriched for il - 1beta , shown to modulate csf - 1 and il - 34 , in a nf - kappab - dependent manner22 ( figure 4a , heat map ) .
we used several approaches to validate some of these findings : facs analysis of double - stained h - 2595 and h - 2373 cells confirmed the relative enrichment of csf - 1rpos cells for the expression of cd44 , oct4 , sox2 , endoglin and abcg2 in unsorted cell populations ( figure 4b and supplementary figure 3a , respectively ) .
additionally , we confirmed higher levels of c - myc and il - 1beta in the csf - 1rpos cells by indirect immunofluorescence ( if ) ( figure 4c ) .
elisa assays on conditioned media from the sorted cells confirmed the presence of high levels of mmp - 9 ( figure 4d and supplementary figure 3b ) .
in addition , according to the enrichment of the sorted cells for aldehyde - dehydrogenase 1a3 ( aldh1a3 ) mrna ( figure 4a ) , we evaluated the presence of aldh activity in the csf - 1rpos cells .
briefly , we analyzed the accumulation of a fluorescent aldh substrate into the cells , by using those treated with a specific aldh inhibitor ( deab ( diethylaminobenzaldehyde )) as a background control ( aldefluor kit , stemcell technologies inc. , vancouver , bc , canada ) .
this showed that the csf - 1rpos cells were endowed with aldh activity ( figure 4e , upper panel ) .
aldh is a detoxifying enzyme whose function has been linked to cancer chemoresistance.23 indeed , both aldh1a3 mrna and aldh activity were significantly increased by pemetrexed treatment in the csf - 1rpos cells , as shown by qrt - pcr and facs , respectively ( figure 4e , lower panel and supplementary figure 3c ) , thus further supporting the chemoresistant properties of this cell sub - population .
next , we found that the high levels of c - myc in the csf - 1rpos cells inversely correlated with those of the mature microrna ( mirna ) let - 7d ( figure 4f and supplementary figure 3d ) , a typical feature of undifferentiated cells , in both h - 2595 and h - 2373 csf1rpos cells.24 csf - 1rpos cells rely on autocrine signaling to akt for their survival both csf - 1 and il - 34 mrnas were expressed by the ( figure 5 ) purified csf - 1rpos cells and secreted in the medium , thereby demonstrating the existence of autocrine production of the ligands ( figure 5a ) .
this was functionally relevant , as western blotting revealed high enrichment of the purified csf - 1rpos cells for phospho - stat3 ( tyr705 ) , phospho - nf - kappab ( p - p65 - ser536 ) and phospho - akt ( ser473 ) .
no differences of the phospho - extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( erk1 / 2 ) ( tyr704 ) signal were observed between unsorted and csf - 1rpos cells ( figure 5b ) .
next , we investigated the relevance of the autocrine csf - 1 and il - 34 production for the survival of the csf - 1rpos cells .
we treated the purified cells with scrambled - , csf - 1 - or il - 34 - targeting small interfering rnas ( sirnas ) ( 20 pm , 48 h ) , which strongly reduced the levels of csf - 1 and il - 34 mrnas ( supplementary figures 4a and b ) .
cell proliferation assays showed that the depletion of either of the ligands by sirna affected the growth of the csf - 1rpos cells , with the strongest effect following the simultaneous downregulation of both ligands ( figure 5c ) .
next , we investigated which of the signaling events , downstream to csf - 1r activation , could promote the survival of the csf - 1rpos cells , thereby potentially affecting their chemoresistance .
we evaluated the effect of two naturally occurring , polyfunctional nf - kappab / stat3 inhibitors , namely parthenolide and butein ( 2 ' , 3,4,4 ' - tetrahydroxychalcone ) , and two more specific akt and erk small - molecule inhibitors , namely ly294002 ( pi3k / akt ) and u0126 ( mek1 / 2 - erk1 / 2 ) .
these compounds were chosen for their ability to counteract the chemoresistance of malignant mesothelioma and other tumor models.25 , 26 , 27 , 28 facs analysis of the purified , bromodeoxyuridine ( brdu ) - labeled csf - 1rpos cells ( from h - 2595 and h - 2373 cells ) revealed that three of the tested compounds were capable of significantly decreasing the growth of the h - 2595 - and h - 2373 - derived csf - 1rpos cells , with the erk inhibitor showing no effect and the akt inhibitor the strongest one ( figure 5d and supplementary figure 4c ) .
staining of the treated cells for sa - beta - galactosidase ( beta - gal ) activity showed that the lack of brdu incorporation was mainly due to senescence , with the ly294002 treatment eliciting the highest number of senescent cells ( figure 4e ) .
this correlated with the upregulation of p21 in the ly294002 csf - 1rpos - treated cells , which was further increased in the pemetrexed - treated samples ( figure 5f ) .
thus , csf - 1r activation may trigger prosurvival stimuli by reducing spontaneous senescence mainly via akt activation .
csf - 1r transforms mesothelial cells to understand whether the active csf - 1r signaling was sufficient to drive malignant properties in untransformed mesothelial cells , we expressed a ligand - independent , constitutively active mutant of csf - 1r ( ca - csf - 1r : harboring a mutation in the ligand - binding domain and in the extracellular tail ) 29 , 30 in the lp9 cells ( figure 6 ) .
the latter are characterized by slow growth , no clonogenicity and sensitivity to chemotherapy .
we found that the expression of ca - csf - 1r triggered changes in cell morphology and growth kinetics by conferring to the lp9 cells , a epithelial , loosely adherent phenotype and a much faster growth rate ( as compared with the empty - vector - infected ones : ev - lp9 ) ( figure 6a , upper and lower panels , respectively ) .
qrt - pcr demonstrated that the gene expression changes in the ca - csf - 1r - expressing cells closely mimicked what was observed in the cells endogenously expressing csf - 1r ( supplementary figure 5a ) .
western blotting confirmed the increased expression of sox2 and musashi - 1 in the ca - csf - 1r - expressing cells ( supplementary figure 5b ) .
in addition , the ca - csf - 1r - expressing lp9 cells were clonogenic and resistant to pemetrexed treatment ( figure 6b ) .
based on the previous findings ( figure 5 ) , we evaluated the akt activation status in ca - csf - 1r - and ev - lp9 .
western blotting revealed that , in addition to increased levels of serine - and threonine - phosphorylated akt , the ca - csf - 1r - lp9 cells exhibited increased levels of phosphorylated pdk1 ( ser241 ) and glycogen synthetase kinase - 3beta ( gsk3beta ) ( ser9 ) , and main upstream and downstream effectors of akt signaling , respectively ( figure 6c ) .
we also observed increased phosphorylated c - raf ( ser259 ) , which connects the mitogen - activated protein kinases ( erk1 / 2 ) activation to the akt pathway31 ( figure 6c ) .
phosphorylation of gsk3beta at serine 9 inactivates this kinase activity and causes stabilization and nuclear localization of beta - catenin from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm and the nucleus , where the latter acts as a transcription cofactor for developmentally regulated genes.32 according to this , western blotting revealed increased levels of beta - catenin in the ca - csf - 1r - lp9 cells ( figure 6c ) .
additionally , indirect if indicated increased nuclear localization of beta - catenin in the ca - csf - 1r - lp9 cells as compared with their controls ( figure 6d , upper panel ) .
to assess whether the nuclear - localized beta - catenin was functional , we transfected beta - catenin - responsive reporter vectors , containing wild - type or mutated tcf - binding sites , in both empty vector ( ev ) and ca - csf - 1r - expressing cells .
this revealed a much higher transcriptional activity in the ca - csf - 1r - lp9 ( figure 6d , lower panel ) , in agreement with the increased levels and nuclear localization of the protein in those cells .
also , the beta - catenin - dependent transcriptional activity was inhibited by treatment with the akt inhibitor in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 6d , lower panel ) .
this suggests that akt activation contributed to the higher levels of functionally active beta - catenin .
next , we evaluated the effect of inhibiting akt on the response of ev - and ca - csf - 1r - lp9 to pemetrexed .
sa - beta - gal assay revealed that , while pemetrexed treatment strongly increased the number of senescent cells in the control ev - lp9 cells , no senescent cells were observed in the ca - csf1r - expressing lp9 ( figure 6e , upper and middle panels ) .
notably , pretreatment of ca - csf1r - lp9 cells with ly294002 strongly increased the number of senescent cells in both vehicle - and pemetrexed - treated cells ( figure 6f , lower panel ) and only slightly increased the number of apoptotic cells ( supplementary figure 5c ) .
in line with the increase of senescent cells in the ly294002 - treated samples , the clonogenic assays revealed that akt inhibition reversed the resistance of ca - csfr - expressing cells to pemetrexed ( figure 6f , upper panel ) .
ly294002 treatment was accompanied by the upregulation of p21 and downregulation of c - myc proteins in both vehicle - and pemetrexed - treated samples , as revealed by western blotting ( figure 6f , lower panel ) .
this established a link between the expression of ca - csf - 1r expression , akt activation and chemoresistance of the mesothelial cells .
discussion previous work has reported expression of the csf - 1r and its ligand csf - 1 in solid tissue tumors and cell lines , and in some cases this was shown to be prognostic or to correlate with the in vitro aggressiveness of the cell lines .
however , no studies to date have isolated and characterized the csf - 1r - expressing cells and thereby exploring their biological properties at the single - cell level .
thus , we report a novel finding that csf - 1r expression identifies precursor - like , self - renewing mesothelioma cell sub - populations endowed with prominent protumorigenic properties , such as clonogenicity and chemoresistance .
in addition , we showed that il - 34 , structurally unrelated ligand for the csf - 1r , has a role in the maintainance of the csf - 1rpos cell sub - populations .
this potential oncogenic role of il - 34 is unprecedented .
the findings of this work may be clinically relevant .
indeed , we report increased expression of csf - 1r in mesothelioma patient samples as compared with matched normal peritoneal tissues ( n = 34 ) .
besides , we showed that csf - 1rpos cells exist and persist within long - term primary cultures ( n = 7 ) and are resistant to pemetrexed in a csf - 1r - dependent manner .
the fact that the ex vivo cultures used in this study are virtually devoid of any hematopoietic component and that their strongly similar behavior to long - term established mpm cell lines ( n = 7 ) support what was observed here is mainly a property of stable , csf - 1r - expressing cells of mesothelial nature .
therefore , the experimental model adopted here potentially expands what is known on the tumor - supporting , macrophage - independent functions of the csf - 1r in an autocrine setting .
the purified csf - 1rpos cells exhibit enrichment for sox2 , oct4 and c - myc , and express low mirna - let - 7d levels .
in addition , those cells express notch1 and endoglin .
interestingly , notch1 upregulation by the sv40 virus was causally linked to mesothelial cell immortalization.33 endoglin promoted resistance of ovarian cancer cells to dna - damaging agents in vitro and in vivo.34 in line with this , the expression of aldh1a3 mrna and activity and the surface enrichment for drug - effluxing activities , such abcg2 , support the chemoresistant properties of the isolated cell sub - populations .
therefore , expression of all the above factors is likely to confer a precursor - like , chemoresistant status to the csf - 1rpos cells .
in terms of signaling , we provide evidence that activation of akt is central to the properties of the csf - 1rpos cells , including survival and resistance to pemetrexed .
in detail , akt inhibition indeed counteracted the bypass of senescence induced by the expression of active csf - 1r in pemetrexed - treated mesothelial cells , thereby restoring their chemosensitivity .
interestingly , activation of beta - catenin by csf - 1 was shown to promote survival and expression of c - myc and cyclind1 in bone - marrow - derived macrophages.35 additionally , the increased functional competence of beta - catenin upon expression of activated csf - 1r and its sensitivity to akt inhibition shown here suggest that beta - catenin - dependent transcriptional mechanisms may have a role in shaping the expression profile of the csf - 1rpos cells .
our observations suggest that , in addition to that of akt , activation of the stat3 and nf - kappab pathways may take place in the csf - 1rpos cells as well and contribute to the survival of the csf - 1rpos cells .
we have recently shown that functional interaction of stat3 and nf - kappab impinges on mesothelioma resistance to pemetrexed by modulating emt - associated genes and that butein abated the resistance of mesothelioma cells by decreasing the pstat3 - nf - kappab interaction.26 this is interesting , given the functional and physical crosstalk between the akt , stat3 and nf - kappab pathways shown in other experimental systems ( such as myc - driven lymphomas ). 36 thus , an intriguing degree of pathway interaction seems to sustain the expression of pluripotency and emt factors , ultimately impinging on a chemoresistant phenotype .
an interesting aspect of this study is that interference with the survival of the csf - 1rpos cells ( typically representing < 10 % of the total live cells in unfractionated cultures ) abated the resistance of both cell lines and primary samples to pemetrexed at a much greater extent than it would be expected by targeting only the csf - 1rpos cells .
it is possible that molecules secreted by the csf - 1rpos cells may confer oncogenic signals to adjacent , non - csf - 1rpos cells. with regard to this , the csf - 1rpos cells have the potential to secrete tgfbeta1 and il - 1beta , potent inducers of emt , and emt is a strong determinant of chemoresistance and a prognostic factor for mesothelioma.37 , 38 therefore , the csf - 1rpos cells may act in this regard as tumor - supporting mesenchymal elements .
the increase of il - 1beta triggered by csf - 1r activation may also be relevant for the induction of csf - 1 and il - 34 expression , as shown in osteoblast studies.22 thus , the csf - 1rpos cells can be attractive targets in vivo as interference with their survival broadly affects the protumorigenic features of both mesothelioma primary cultures and cell lines .
in this respect , our observations indicate that both csf - 1r and akt inhibition may be clinically relevant tools to overcome mesothelioma chemoresistance .
this may allow expansion of the poor therapeutic portfolio for such a fatal disease .
it is also possible that the findings herein may be applied to other inflammation - related neoplasms , of which mesothelioma is a prototype .

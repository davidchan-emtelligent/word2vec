ewing sarcoma is an aggressive tumor of bone and soft tissue affecting predominantly children and young adults .
tumor - specific chromosomal translocations create ews - fli1 and similar aberrant ets fusion proteins that drive sarcoma development in patients .
ets family fusion proteins and over - expressed ets proteins are also found in acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) patients .
transgenic expression of ews - fli1 in mice promotes high penetrance erythroid leukemia with dense hepatic and splenic infiltrations .
we identified a small molecule , yk - 4 - 279 , that directly binds to ews - fli1 and inhibits its oncogenic activity in ewing sarcoma cell lines and xenograft mouse models .
herein , we tested in vivo therapeutic efficacy and potential side effects of yk - 4 - 279 in the transgenic mouse model with ews - fli1 induced leukemia .
a two - week course of treatment with yk - 4 - 279 significantly reduced white blood cell count , nucleated erythroblasts in the peripheral blood , splenomegaly , and hepatomegaly of erythroleukemic mice .
yk - 4 - 279 inhibited ews - fli1 target gene expression in neoplastic cells .
treated animals showed significantly better overall survival compared to control mice that rapidly succumbed to leukemia .
yk - 4 - 279 treated mice did not show overt toxicity in liver , spleen , or bone marrow .
in conclusion , this in vivo study highlights the efficacy of yk - 4 - 279 to treat ews - fli1 expressing neoplasms and support its therapeutic potential for patients with ewing sarcoma and other ets - driven malignancies .
ews - fli1 ets fusion proteins yk - 4 - 279 ewing sarcoma erythoid leukemia introduction ewing sarcoma is a neoplasm of the bone and soft tissue .
it is characterized by a pathognomonic chromosomal translocation involving ews and fli1 or related genes that occurs in about 95 % of cases [ 1 ] .
ews is a member of tet family of rna binding proteins that is ubiquitously expressed [ 2 ] with proposed functions in transcription [ 3 , 4 ] , rna processing [ 5 , 6 ] , and signal transduction [ 7 - 9 ] .
on the other hand , fli1 is a member of ets family of transcription factors that is predominantly expressed during embryonic development and exclusively in hematopoietic cells in adult tissues [ 10 ] .
the translocation leads to juxtaposition of the amino - terminal portion of ews with the carboxy - terminus of fli1 ; the fusion protein differs from wild - type proteins based upon loss of the rna binding domain of ews and transactivational domain of fli1 [ 11 ] .
ews - fli1 fusion protein confers its tumorigenic phenotype through aberrant transcriptional activity [ 12 - 15 ] and splicing [ 16 - 20 ] .
ews - fli1 can transform nih - 3t3 cells [ 21 ] , primary bone marrow derived mesenchymal progenitors [ 22 ] , and osteochondrogenic progenitors [ 23 ] .
in order to efficiently transform cells , both ews and fli1 regions of the chimeric transcript are required , although deletions of certain regions modulate its potency [ 24 ] .
anti - sense oligodeoxynucleotide or sequence specific sirna mediated knockdown of ews - fli1 gene expression is detrimental to ewing sarcoma cells [ 25 - 28 ] .
these findings highlight the significance of ews - fli1 for initiating and maintaining tumorigenicity of ewing sarcoma cells ; hence its potential for targeted therapy .
in addition , ews - fli1 is exclusively present in ewing sarcoma cells , compared to non - tumor somatic cells , further emphasizing ews - fli1 as the ideal therapeutic target for ewing sarcoma [ 29 ] .
we identified a small molecule inhibitor , yk - 4 - 279 , that directly binds to ews - fli1 and inhibits its oncogenic activity in ewing sarcoma cell lines and xenograft mouse models [ 30 - 32 ] .
yk - 4 - 279 showed a significant differential cytotoxicity to cells that harbor ews - fli1 compared to those cells that do not , confirming the specificity of this molecule [ 30 , 31 ] .
yk - 4 - 279 blocks specific protein interactions with ews - fli1 including ddx5 and rha leading to altered mrna splicing [ 19 ] as well as transcription [ 30 , 31 ] .
yk - 4 - 279 can also block growth of other ets driven cancers .
yk - 4 - 279 inhibited erg and etv1 derived malignant phenotypes in prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo [ 33 , 34 ] .
uncertainty about the exact cell type that gives rise to ewing sarcoma contributes to the lack of in vivo models for the disease , which has hindered preclinical study efforts .
torchia et al have generated a double transgenic mouse model ( referred hereafter as e / f ; mx1 - cre ) where expression of ews - fli1 was targeted to the bone marrow , spleen , and liver .
this targeted expression resulted from breeding rosa26 - loxp - stop - loxp - ews - fli1 ( e / f ) mice with animals that expressed cre recombinase under the pipc responsive mx1 - promoter ( mx1 - cre ) [ 35 ] .
expression of ews - fli1 in these tissues induced expansion of primitive erythroid / myeloid progenitors leading to rapid leukemia development that caused severe hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , anemia , and 90 % mortality within 28 days [ 35 ] .
here , we tested the efficacy of yk - 4 - 279 in disrupting the oncogenic activity of ews - fli1 in vivo using the above model .
yk - 4 - 279 treatment inhibited ews - fli1 target gene expression including mest , cpne7 , c - myc , gata1 , gata2 , and car8 .
we showed that short - term yk - 4 - 279 treatment led to correction of abnormal hematopoiesis and improved overall survival in ews - fli1 + leukemic mice without overt side effects .
we conclude that direct targeting of aberrant ets transcription factors with small molecules could be of significant therapeutic value in oncology .
results ews - fli1 expression is induced in e / f ; mx1 - cre transgenic mouse model in order to confirm that ews - fli1 expression is induced in the e / f ; mx1 - cre transgenic mouse model , protein and rna was extracted from spleens of wt ( c57bl / 6 ) mice , e / f ; control mice ( e / f mice that did not inherit mx1 - cre ) , and pipc induced e / f ; mx1 - cre mice and were subjected to western blotting and rt - qpcr , respectively .
the transgene was detected in the spleens of e / f ; mx1 - cre mice verifying that the e / f ; mx1 - cre transgenic mouse model expresses the therapeutic target of interest ( figures 1a and 1b ) .
ews - fli1 was not detected at either mrna or protein level in wt mice .
ews - fli1 mrna level in e / f ; control mice was 564 fold over wt mice ( figure 1a ) .
this could be due to a leaky read through transcription .
however , the expression was not enough to make a detectable protein ( figure 1b ) .
it is possible that the protein level may have been below the detection limit of the technique or the antibody used .
regardless , the leaky expression observed in e / f ; control mice was not biologically significant since these mice did not develop leukemia over one year follow up. figure 1 ews - fli1 is expressed in e / f ; mx1 - cre mouse model a. rt - qpcr comparing ews - fli1 mrna level in spleens of wt ( c57bl / 6 ) ( n = 3 ) , e / f ; control ( n = 2 ) , vs. e / f ; mx1 - cre ( n = 3 ) mice. b. western blot showing protein levels of ews - fli1 in spleens of e / f ; mx1 - cre transgenic mice compared to wt ( c57bl / 6 ) mice and e / f ; control mice that lack cre required for ews - fli1 activation .
anti - fli1 antibody epitope is retained in ews - fli1 .
endogenous fli1 is highly expressed in the normal mouse spleens .
anti - ha antibody was used to detect the protein level of ews - fli1 that is ha tagged .
actin was used as a loading control .
each lane represents an individual animal .
cd43 + , cd71 + , cd117 + , cd45 - , cells are enriched in the spleens and peripheral blood of mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia malignant cells of e / f ; mx1 - cre mice co - express cd43 , cd71 , and cd117 , but do not express cd45 or cd34 [ 35 ] .
cd43 ( leukosialin ) is expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors including those of erythroid lineage that are often cd43 + , cd34 - and cd45 - [ 36 ] .
cd71 ( transferrin receptor ) is highly expressed in immature erythroid cells with the highest levels in early erythroid precursors through intermediate normoblast phase [ 37 , 38 ] .
cd117 ( c - kit ) can differentiate erythroblasts from other progenitors when used in combination with other cell surface antigens such as cd45 and cd71 .
cells from the spleen and peripheral circulation of leukemic e / f ; mx1 - cre mice were evaluated for surface antigen expression and showed a phenotype of cd43 + , cd71 + , cd117 + , and cd45 - . we used this profile to characterize cells from control mice and pipc induced e / f ; mx1 - cre mice with late stage leukemia .
only 0.14 % of the splenocytes from e / f ; control mice were cd43 + and cd45 - compared to 45.73 % in mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia ( figure 2a ) .
moreover , only 0.11 % of the splenocytes of control mice were cd71 + and cd117 + compared to 42.36 % in mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia ( figure 2a ) .
the enrichment of these populations was also observed in the peripheral blood , where only 0.04 % and 0.10 % of the cells from peripheral blood of e / f ; control mice were cd43 +/ cd45 - and cd71 +/ cd117 + , respectively , compared to 24.57 % and 21.96 % in e / f ; mx1 - cre mice with leukemia ( figure 2b ) .
throughout our investigations , we used these biomarkers to monitor leukemia induction and response to treatment .
figure 2 cd43 + , cd71 + , cd117 + , and cd45 - , cells are enriched in spleens and peripheral blood of mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia cells from a. spleen and b. peripheral circulation of mice with ews - fli1 - induced leukemia vs. control were evaluated for surface antigen expression .
the cells were stained with fluorescently labeled cd43 , cd45 , cd71 , and cd117 antibodies , subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry .
ews - fli1 induced leukemia display marked increase in clonogenic capacity , which is reduced by yk - 4 - 279 we analyzed splenocytes for colony forming unit ( cfu ) in the presence of vehicle ( dmso ) compared to treatment with 3 mum or 10 mum yk - 4 - 279 to test the effect of the small molecule on ews - fli1 induced leukemia in vitro .
splenocytes of healthy adult mice have low numbers of colony forming cells ( cfcs ) .
e / f ; control mouse had an average of 8 cfcs / 100,000 cells , while splenocytes of a littermate mouse with ews - fli1 induced leukemia of the same sex and age had significantly increased cfcs ( an average of 563 cfcs / 100,000 cells ) suggesting that most of these cfcs are leukemic progenitors ( figure 3a ) .
treatment of cfc cultures with 3 mum or 10 mum yk - 4 - 279 led to 90 % or 99 % reduction , respectively , in the clonogenic capacity of leukemic stem cells of the same mouse .
in addition , colonies from e / f ; mx1 - cre mice splenocytes were larger in size than those of control mice ( figure 3b ) .
figure 3 spleen cells of mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia display significantly increased clonogenic potential , which is inhibited by yk - 4 - 279 a. the number of colony forming cells ( cfcs ) in 1 x 105 spleen cells of leukemic e / f ; mx1 - cre vs. e / f ; control mice was evaluated in an in vitro colony forming unit ( cfu ) assay .
effect of yk - 4 - 279 on colony forming potential of cells from ews - fli1 induced leukemic mice was assessed in the presence of vehicle ( dmso ) vs. 3 mum or 10 mum yk - 4 - 279 .
colonies were counted on the 4th day following plating .
*** ; p < 0.0001. b. representative phase contrast images of cfu colonies from each experimental condition are given .
yk - 4 - 279 significantly reduced disease burden of e / f ; mx1 - cre leukemic mice we then investigated the effect of yk - 4 - 279 on disease burden of mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia .
e / f ; mx1 - cre mice were injected with 1 mg pipc at 1 month of age to activate mx1 promoter .
the animals were followed up with weekly blood analysis for evidence of disease .
once an increase in white blood cell ( wbc ) count to an average of 10,000 cells / mul of blood and a 0.4 - 4 % enrichment of cd43 + , cd71 + , cd117 + , and cd45 - erythroblasts in the peripheral blood were observed , the mice were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups ( day 0 ) ( figures 4a - 4c ) .
leukemic e / f ; mx1 - cre mice were treated with once a day intraperitoneal injections ( ip ) of yk - 4 - 279 five - times a week for two weeks at a dose of 200 mg / kg for the first two injections followed by 150 mg / kg for the remaining injections .
the mice were then euthanized two weeks following the start of therapy ( day14 ) .
figure 4 yk - 4 - 279 antagonizes ews - fli1 driven erythroleukemia a. effect of yk - 4 - 279 on white blood cell count of leukemic e / f ; mx1 - cre mice at time of randomization ( day 0 ) , one week after treatment ( day 7 ) , and two weeks following treatment or at the time of euthanasia ( day 14 ) was assessed. b. and c. enrichment of erythroblasts ( cd43 + , cd71 + , cd117 + , and cd45 - white blood cells ) in peripheral circulation at time of randomization to yk - 4 - 279 or dmso treatment ( day 0 ) and after two weeks of treatment ( day 14 ) was evaluated .
erythroblast enrichment in the peripheral blood of pipc injected e / f ; mx1 - cre mice was monitored and was compared to healthy e / f ; control mice to confirm leukemia induction .
mice were assigned to treatment following an average enrichment of cd43 +/ cd45 - and cd71 +/ cd117 + wbc to 1.41 % and 1.75 % compared to 0.02 % and 0.19 % in e / f ; control mice .
the amount of erythroblasts in the peripheral blood after the two weeks long treatment regimen with yk - 4 - 279 vs. dmso was compared to assess efficacy of yk - 4 - 279 in inhibiting ews - fli1 driven erythroleukemia .
additionally post - mortem d. spleen , e. liver , and f. body weights of yk - 4 - 279 or vehicle treated mice were compared to those of healthy e / f ; control mice of the same age at day 14 to show the effect of treatment in reducing hepatomegaly and splenomegaly .
representative spleen and liver images of healthy e / f ; control mice and dmso or yk - 4 - 279 treated leukemic e / f ; mx1 - cre mice are given .
* ; p < 0.05 , ** ; p < 0.001 , *** ; p < 0.0001 , ns ; not - significant .
weekly wbc counts , rbc counts and blood smears along with post - mortem immunophenotyping and spleen and liver weights were used to assess disease burden .
following one week of treatment , a statistically significant reduction of wbc count occurred in the yk - 4 - 279 treatment group vs. control ( p < 0.02 ) ( figure 4a ) .
the treatment effect was even more pronounced after two weeks with significant reduction in wbc count ( p < 0.0001 ) ( figure 4a ) .
overall , yk - 4 - 279 significantly lowered the amount of blast cells in the peripheral blood ( figures 4b and 4c and figure 5 ) .
following the two weeks treatment , the average enrichment of erythroblasts in the peripheral blood as characterized by cd43 +/ cd45 - and cd71 +/ cd117 + cells was 15.1 % and 13.5 % for dmso group compared to 6.8 % and 6.3 % for yk - 4 - 279 treatment group ( figure 4b and 4c ) .
ews - fli1 induced leukemia is characterized by splenomegaly and hepatomegaly .
yk - 4 - 279 significantly reduced the spleen and liver weights of e / f ; mx1 - cre mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia without affecting the total body weight measured at the time of euthanasia ( figures 4d - 4f ) .
furthermore , yk - 4 - 279 treatment rescued the anemic state of the leukemic mice at late stage ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
figure 5 yk - 4 - 279 reduced nucleated erythroblast cells in peripheral blood smears of mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia representative images of peripheral blood smears of e / f ; mx1 - cre mice before pipc induction are given on the left column .
images of blood smears after one week ( middle ) and two weeks ( right ) of treatment with yk - 4 - 279 or vehicle are shown .
induction of ews - fli1 expression causes a high white blood cell count originating from an erythroblast expansion .
this expansion could be efficiently blocked by yk - 4 - 279 treatment .
since gata1 is one of the most highly up - regulated genes in erythroblasts of e / f ; mx1 - cre animals , gata1 immunostaining was used as a reliable biomarker in the leukemia mouse model to trace erythroblasts .
our findings from ihc staining revealed that gata1 + erythroblasts were effectively diminished in liver and spleen upon yk - 4 - 279 treatment , but dmso treated mice had dense hepatic infiltration of gata1 + erythroblasts ( figures 6 and 7 and supplementary figure s2 ) .
improved spleen and liver architectures were observed upon yk - 4 - 279 treatment in mice compared to severe infiltration of erythroid progenitors in vehicle treated mice .
figure 6 erythroblast infiltration and expansion was efficiently blocked by yk - 4 - 279 e / f ; mx1 - cre mice after two weeks treatment with vehicle ( middle row ) or yk - 4 - 279 ( bottom row ) were euthanized and spleen and liver samples were processed for histo - pathology analysis .
e / f ; control mice served as healthy controls ( top row ) .
e / f ; control mice do not display any symptoms due to the lack of mx1 - cre transgene that allows for cre mediated recombination leading to subsequent ews - fli1 activation .
hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) staining displays disrupted spleen and liver architecture due to massive infiltration and expansion of erythroblasts .
erythroblast infiltration and expansion was efficiently blocked by two weeks yk - 4 - 279 treatment improving splenic architecture ( germinal center formation ) and restoring normal liver architecture .
figure 7 gata1 + erythroblasts were effectively diminished in liver and spleen upon yk - 4 - 279 treatment e / f ; mx1 - cre mice after two weeks treatment with vehicle ( middle row ) or yk - 4 - 279 ( bottom row ) were euthanized and spleen and liver samples were processed for histo - pathology analysis .
e / f ; control mice served as healthy controls ( top row ) since they lack cre required for ews - fli1 activation .
ews - fli1 + erythroblasts stain positive for the erythroid lineage differentiation factor gata1 .
a much weaker gata1 staining in the spleen and liver of yk - 4 - 279 treated mice was observed which is indicative of efficient leukemic disease blockade .
evaluation of the bone marrow from e / f ; mx1 - cre mice showed disease involvement in dmso treated group , which had reduced number of megakaryocytes , granulocytes and erythroid cells compared to normal mice without the disease ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
we also observed increased number of immature cells and apoptotic cells .
when the animals were treated with yk - 4 - 279 , the overall morphology of bone marrow showed a significant shift towards normal .
disease burden in bone marrow was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry for gata1 protein .
in normal bone marrow , only the erythroid lineage cells were stained positive for gata1 .
ews - fli1 induced leukemia resulted in overpopulation of bone marrow with gata1 positive cells , which was significantly reduced in yk - 4 - 279 treated animals ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
however , a complete elimination of immature cells and restoration of normal structures were not observed , which may explain the disease recurrence following cessation of yk - 4 - 279 treatment after two weeks .
we measured cleaved caspase 3 as an apoptosis marker and ki67 as a proliferation marker .
e / f ; control mice without mx1 - cre served as negative controls in immunostainings , which did not display any symptoms of disease or any unusual apoptosis or proliferation .
yk - 4 - 279 treatment caused little apoptosis in liver or spleen after two weeks of treatment ( figure 8 and supplementary figure s2 ) .
the lack of cleaved caspase 3 positive cells in spleens and livers of yk - 4 - 279 treated mice could be due to a number of reasons .
apoptotic erythroblast infiltrates could have been efficiently eradicated by tissue macrophages before the two weeks time point or may have apoptosed prior to infiltrating the spleen or liver .
on the other hand , yk - 4 - 279 may have induced other form of cell death that does n't involve caspase 3 .
alternatively , inhibition of ews - fli1 function with yk - 4 - 279 may have caused the leukemic cells to differentiate and lose their leukemic property .
yk - 4 - 279 may have also induced cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis , which could not have been recognized by ihc for cleaved caspase 3 .
we noted a more prominent cleaved caspase 3 staining in splenic infiltration of dmso treated severely diseased mice ( figure 8 and supplementary figure s2 ) .
this is indicative of high spontaneous apoptosis in the leukemic cells that appear quite rapidly in the mice with dense splenic infiltrations .
the lack of cleaved caspase 3 staining in the normal liver and spleen cells in yk - 4 - 279 treated mice suggests the treatment 's minimal toxicity towards the normal cells .
this is consistent with the finding that the treatment did not cause liver damage as assessed by serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) and alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) ( supplementary figure s4 ) .
ki67 staining was very prominent in dmso treated mice , but yk - 4 - 279 treatment eradicated erythroblasts in the diffuse hepatic infiltrated areas ( figure 9 and supplementary figure s2 ) .
the difference was less pronounced in the spleen where there was still prominent ki67 staining in yk - 4 - 279 treated spleens ( figure 9 and supplementary figure s2 ) .
figure 8 yk - 4 - 279 caused little apoptosis in liver or spleen after two weeks of treatment e / f ; mx1 - cre mice after two weeks treatment with vehicle ( middle row ) or yk - 4 - 279 ( bottom row ) were euthanized and spleen and liver samples were processed for histo - pathology analysis .
e / f ; control mice served as healthy controls ( top row ) which did not display any symptoms of disease or any peculiar apoptosis or proliferation .
cleaved caspase 3 was utilized as a marker of apoptosis for immunohistochemistry .
improved splenic and liver architectures were noted at the analysis time of two weeks after yk - 4 - 279 treatment .
at that time , there were no significant apoptosis detectable in the spleen or liver suggesting a healthy organ .
figure 9 decreased proliferation was observed in spleens and livers of yk - 4 - 279 treated leukemic mice e / f ; mx1 - cre mice after two weeks treatment with vehicle ( middle row ) or yk - 4 - 279 ( bottom row ) were euthanized and spleen and liver samples were processed for histo - pathology analysis .
e / f ; control mice that lack cre required for ews - fli1 activation served as healthy controls ( top row ) which did not display any symptoms of disease or any peculiar apoptosis or proliferation .
ki67 was used as a marker of proliferation .
ki67 staining of spleen and liver tissues of leukemic e / f ; mx1 - cre mice treated with yk - 4 - 279 show a decreased proliferation compared to vehicle treated mice .
yk - 4 - 279 inhibited ews - fli1 regulated genes in e / f ; mx1 - cre mice one mechanism the fusion gene product promotes ewing sarcoma is through transcriptional modulation of target genes .
we investigated the impact of yk - 4 - 279 on transcriptional activity of ews - fli1 in e / f ; mx1 - cre mice .
surprisingly , previously published ews - fli1 target genes were unchanged upon ews - fli1 activation in e / f ; mx1 - cre mice and the expression profile of ews - fli1 induced leukemic cells was different from those of ewing tumors [ 35 ] .
ews - fli1 may modulate different sets of genes in different cell types to induce leukemia vs. sarcoma .
mest ( mesoderm specific transcript ) , cpne7 ( copine vii ) , c - myc , car8 ( carbonic anahydrase viii ) , gata1 ( gata binding protein 1 ) , and gata2 ( gata binding protein 2 ) are some of the genes differentially regulated in cells with activated ews - fli1 in the e / f ; mx1 - cre mouse model [ 35 ] .
mest , cpne7 , c - myc , car8 , gata1 , and gata2 were upregulated upon induction of ews - fli1 expression in spleens of e / f ; mx1 - cre mice ( figure 10a ) .
yk - 4 - 279 reversed the levels of these genes close to e / f ; control mice ( figure 10a ) .
the extent of reduction in gata1 expression ( figure 10a ) is less marked compared to the level of reduction observed in the ihc data ( figure 7 and supplementary figure s2 ) .
this could be because of the inherent difference that exists when looking at gata1 at rna level in rt - qpcr vs. at protein level in ihc .
figure 10 yk - 4 - 279 inhibited genes deregulated by ews - fli1 in e / f ; mx1 - cre mice a. mest ( mesoderm specific transcript ) , cpne7 ( copine vii ) , c - myc , car8 ( carbonic anhydrase 8 ) , gata2 ( gata binding protein 2 ) , and gata1 ( gata binding protein 1 ) are up - regulated when ews - fli1 is expressed through cre mediated recombination of rosa26 - loxp - stop - loxp - ews - fli1 site in e / f ; mx1 - cre mice .
the expression of these genes was significantly reduced following two weeks of treatment with yk - 4 - 279 ( n = 12 ) over control ( n = 12 ). b. ews - fli1 level did show significant change after two weeks of treatment with yk - 4 - 279 at mrna and protein level .
each lane in the western blot represents an individual animal .
* ; p < 0.05 , ** ; p < 0.001 , *** ; p < 0.0001 , ns ; not - significant .
the treatment did not significantly affect the levels of ews - fli1 at either mrna or protein ( figure 10b ) levels , indicating that the reduction in target gene expression might be due to inhibition of ews - fli1 fusion protein 's transcriptional activity .
the mechanism through which yk - 4 - 279 inhibits the transcriptional activity of ews - fli1 is yet to be elucidated .
yk - 4 - 279 does not block ews - fli1 binding to its cognate dna binding sites ( supplementary figure s5 ) .
one possible mechanism may entail yk - 4 - 279 disrupting or interfering with proper assembly of the multi - protein complex required for ews - fli1 transactivity .
rha is one of the proteins that make up ews - fli1 transcriptional complex .
interaction of ews - fli1 with rha regulates its oncogenic properties [ 39 ] .
ability of yk - 4 - 279 to block interaction between ews - fli1 and rha [ 30 , 31 ] or other components of the transcriptional complex may explain yk - 4 - 279 's activity against ews - fli1 mediated transcription .
we observed mitigation in the leukemic phenotype following 2 weeks treatment with yk - 4 - 279 even though ews - fli1 level did not significantly alter .
inhibition of ews - fli1 function with yk - 4 - 279 may cause the leukemic cells to differentiate and lose their leukemic property .
in this case , we may have non - leukemic cells that can still express ews - fli1 .
yk - 4 - 279 significantly improves overall survival of e / f ; mx1 - cre leukemic mice to determine if the observed yk - 4 - 279 activity ( figures 3 - 7 ) can translate into improved survival of mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia , the animals were allowed to live with erythroleukemia following treatment with daily 150 mg / kg yk - 4 - 279 or vehicle ip injections , five times a week for two weeks in a repeat experiment .
a statistically significant improvement in survival of these leukemic mice treated with yk - 4 - 279 was measured where their median survival was 60.5 days as opposed to 21 days for the control group ( figure 11a ) .
during the two weeks of treatment , mice randomized to yk - 4 - 279 had significantly reduced disease burden as monitored by weekly wbc counts .
the wbc count of yk - 4 - 279 treated mice compared to controls was lowered by 54 % ( p < 0.0001 ) and 67 % ( p < 0.002 ) following one week and two weeks of treatment , respectively ( figure 11b ) .
follow - up monitoring beyond the two week treatment period showed that most of the mice that received yk - 4 - 279 retained relatively low wbc counts , while those that received vehicle alone had rapid elevation of wbc that led to deterioration of their health ( figure 11c and 11d ) .

yk - 4 - 279 treatment regimen led to significant reduction of wbc count .

** ; p < 0.001 , *** ; p < 0.0001 , ns ; not - significant .
discussion expression of ews - fli1 in cells with the activated mx1 promoter in e / f ; mx1 - cre mice led to leukemia where the mice presented with severe hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , and anemia followed by rapid death [ 35 ] .
even though these mice do not develop ewing sarcoma , the malignancy is driven by ews - fli1 making the model relevant to test inhibitors that target ews - fli1 .
thus , this pre - clinical model was employed to evaluate the small molecule inhibitor yk - 4 - 279 against an ews - fli1 driven neoplasm .
we show that yk - 4 - 279 significantly reduced clonogenic capacity of leukemic stem cells of e / f ; mx1 - cre mice in vitro .
anti - leukemic effects of yk - 4 - 279 observed in an in vitro cfu assay also translated in vivo .
the treatment led to marked reduction in the spleen and liver weights , wbc count , nucleated erythroblasts in the peripheral blood of mice with ews - fli1 induced leukemia .
moreover , the normal spleen and liver architecture that was severely affected in terminally diseased leukemic mice was partially restored upon yk - 4 - 279 treatment .
the treatment also improved their anemic state .
furthermore , yk - 4 - 279 treatment extended the survival of e / f ; mx1 - cre mice with leukemia .
these results support the therapeutic potential of yk - 4 - 279 in antagonizing malignant phenotype of ews - fli1 .
ets family of transcription factors share a conserved dna binding domain ( ets domain ) all recognizing a purine rich consensus sequence with a central ggaa / t motif [ 40 ] .
most ets transcription factors also harbor a pointed domain ( pnt domain ) that is important for protein - protein interactions [ 41 ] .
ets genes have been implicated in a wide array of malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( cmml ) , myxoid liposarcoma , ewing sarcoma , breast cancer , and prostate cancer [ 42 - 50 ] .
a subgroup of aml [ 43 , 44 , 51 ] and all [ 42 ] patients harbor a fusion protein , tls - erg , which is similar to ews - fli1 .
ews and tls ( fus ) belong to the tet family of rna binding proteins , while fli1 and erg belong to the highly conserved ets family of transcription factors .
tls - erg [ 52 , 53 ] , ews - erg [ 54 ] , and ews - fli1 [ 1 ] have all been reported in ewing sarcoma cases .
additionally , the majority of prostate cancer cases display clear ets - driver dependence .
more than 50 % of prostate cancer patients contain chromosomal translocations that involve members of the ets transcription factor family .
the two ets factors erg and etv1 reprogram the androgen receptor cistrome with consequences for androgen ablation therapy in prostate cancer [ 55 , 56 ] .
moreover , germline or somatic mutations in the tert gene promoter create novel ets binding sites leading to 2 - 4 fold increase in tert protein expression , facilitating immortalization and the override of senescence [ 57 - 59 ] .
tert promoter mutations are frequently observed in malignant melanoma , glioblastomas , hepatocellular and bladder carcinomas [ 60 ] .
therefore , ets factors have emerged as candidates for targeted therapy in multiple types of cancers .
yk - 4 - 279 shows therapeutic potential for ets - driven diseases .
though we still do not know the exact interaction surface , yk - 4 - 279 directly binds to and shows inhibitory activity against ews - fli1 , erg , and etv1 oncoproteins , presumably due to interference with protein - protein interactions [ 31 , 33 , 34 ] .
our group has shown that yk - 4 - 279 binds to erg and etv1 and inhibits their activity in prostate cancer cell lines [ 33 ] and show anti - metastatic activity in vivo [ 34 ] .
hence , potential clinical indications of yk - 4 - 279 or similar compounds targeting ets transcription factors may be significantly expanded .
it is plausible that the ability of yk - 4 - 279 to antagonize the activity of a number of ets family members could pose a risk of toxicity against tissues that expresses ets transcription factors as part of their normal physiology .
ets genes are highly expressed during embryogenesis and hematopoiesis , while their expression is suppressed in most adult epithelial tissues [ 61 - 65 ] .
in this study , yk - 4 - 279 treatment did not suppress but rather enhanced red blood cell counts of e / f ; mx1 - cre mice compared to those leukemic mice treated with vehicle alone .
yk - 4 - 279 caused little apoptosis in normal liver and spleen cells and did not affect liver function as indicated by normal serum levels of liver enzymes .
moreover , yk - 4 - 279 treatment did not lead to body weight loss .
our findings combined with earlier in vivo studies [ 31 , 32 , 34 ] suggest that the inhibitor has a reasonable therapeutic window with no overt cytotoxic issues aside from peritoneal thickening observed at the site of intraperitoneal administration .
further analysis of yk - 4 - 279 's effect on hematopoietic progenitors cells , wbc differential count , and hemoglobin level may help us better evaluate the potential toxicity of the treatment regiment to normal hematopoiesis .
moreover , detailed toxicology studies in large animals would need to be carried out to assess yk - 4 - 279 's safety to humans .
poor solubility of yk - 4 - 279 limits its dosage , frequency , and duration of murine treatment .
therefore , the mice only received a total of 10 injections .
though the disease was suppressed during the time period that the mice were on yk - 4 - 279 , some showed leukemic progression once the treatment was halted ( figure 11d ) .
nevertheless , two weeks of treatment was enough to result in prolonged survival .
future experiments could utilize a treatment plan with a week - on - week - off schedule or a longer treatment regimen with a lower dose to overcome this problem .
furthermore , better drug formulation may significantly improve the pharmacokinetic properties of yk - 4 - 279 .
improved drug formulation may also permit oral administration .
in conclusion , yk - 4 - 279 antagonizes ews - fli1 induced leukemia in a transgenic mouse model .
this supports the continued preclinical development of the compound for not only ewing sarcoma patients , but also for a subgroup of aml , all and prostate cancer patients with highly homologous translocation products or with a clear ets - driven gene signature .
future work to further resolve the mechanism of yk - 4 - 279 inhibition will also enhance fusion protein transcription factor targeted therapeutics .

although the efficacy of propranolol for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas ( ihs ) has been well documented , there is a paucity of clinical data regarding the safety and tolerance of propranolol in neonates .
a prospective study of 51 patients less than 30 days of age with severe ih was conducted .
all patients were admitted to the hospital for monitoring during initial propranolol treatment at day 0 with dose adjustments at days 7 and 28 .
heart rate ( hr ) , systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) , diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) , blood glucose ( bg ) levels and potential side effects were evaluated during treatment .
there were significant decreases in mean heart rate and sbp after the initiation of propranolol therapy ( p < 0.05 ) .
in contrast , no significant differences in mean dbp and bg levels were observed after each dose during hospitalization ( p > 0.05 ) .
bradycardia and hypotension were noted in at least 1 recorded instance in 11.8 % and 5.9 % of patients , respectively .
these hemodynamic changes were not persistent and were asymptomatic .
two patients who had a history of neonatal pneumonia reported severe bronchial hyperreactivity during treatment .
this study demonstrated that propranolol administered to properly selected young infants was safe and well tolerated .
however , close monitoring should be considered in high - risk young patients .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction infantile hemangiomas are the most common vascular tumor in children .
if left untreated , the typical characteristic evolution of these tumors is rapid postnatal proliferation , stabilization and slow , spontaneous involution .
ihs may be located on any region of the body but are mostly located on the skin of the head , face and neck .
although ihs are usually harmless , approximately 12 - 24 % of ihs have complications .
the most commonly occurring complication is ulceration , followed by visual compromise , airway obstruction , auditory canal obstruction and cardiac failure1 .
in many such cases , early intervention may be justified to potentially arrest the growth of the lesion , reduce associated complications , and avoid years of psychosocial concerns .
previously , the standard treatment options for ih included laser , surgical excision or medical therapies such as corticosteroids .
the options in life - threatening cases include treatment with vincristine , interferon - alpha or cyclophosphamide1 .
unfortunately , none of these therapeutic modalities is ideal due to their restrictions or potentially serious side effects , such as temporary growth retardation , increased risk of infection and behavioral changes2 , 3 .
in june 2008 , leaute - labreze et al.4 reported their serendipitous discovery that oral propranolol was effective in the management of severe ihs .
subsequently , a growing number of studies further demonstrated that propranolol stops growth and induces an ih regression that is much better and safer than other treatments , including corticosteroids5 - 9 .
currently , propranolol has been adopted as a first - line therapy for problematic ihs .
regardless of subtype or depth , the largest increase in ih tumor size occurred at a mean age of 3 months , and by 5 months of age both segmental and localized ihs had reached 80 % of their final size10 .
remarkably , an elaborate study by tollefson et al.11 further demonstrated that the most dramatic growth of ihs occurs between 5.5 and 7.5 weeks , which was much earlier than previously estimated .
the authors of these studies suggested the need for a paradigm shift in the timing of referral and initiation of treatment for high - risk ih so that therapy can be initiated before or early during the most rapid growth , rather than after it is already completed .
although propranolol treatment can be efficacious beyond the proliferative phase , irreversible skin changes may have already occurred .
in addition , recent studies have demonstrated that early treatment , especially when started during the proliferating phase , has been shown to be associated with better long - term outcomes12 , 13 .
therefore , for the ihs needing treatment , the ideal time to initiate therapy is either before or as soon as the evidence of permanent anatomic distortion or medical sequelae develop .
however , the use of propranolol in pediatric patients is not without risk .
known side effects of propranolol include hypotension , bradycardia , bronchospasm and hypoglycemia14 , 15 .
many clinicians remain cautious about the administration of oral propranolol for ihs , especially in young infants , because these drugs act systemically and affect the cardiovascular system .
although successful treatment with propranolol has been reported in premature or young infants , no detailed information on cardiovascular data and adverse events was provided16 , 17 .
this prompted us to assess the safety and tolerance of propranolol in our young patients with the purpose of providing evidence - based data for future treatment recommendations .
the goal of this study was to assess the safety and tolerance of oral propranolol in young infants during treatment for severe ihs .
methods a prospective study was performed in infants with problematic ihs who were hospitalized for propranolol initiation between october 2013 and september 2015 .
approval was obtained from the ethics committee of west china hospital of sichuan university .
all procedures followed the research protocols approved by sichuan university and west china hospital of sichuan university and was conducted according to the declaration of helsinki .
parents gave written , informed consent for the use of propranolol in the treatment of ih. this trial was registered on the public database clinicaltrials.gov in january 2015 ( nct02342275 ) .
all patients were recruited in the department of pediatric surgery , at west china hospital of sichuan university .
participation was offered to infants less than 1 month of age ( corrected chronological age ) with proliferating ih needing treatment that was defined as functional impairment , aesthetic disfigurement and whether ihs were ulcerated .
the exclusion criteria were as follows : 1 ) patients who presented with contraindications to beta - blocker therapy , such as allergy or hypersensitivity to propranolol , hypoglycemia , hypotension , second or third degree atrioventricular block , heart failure , severe bradycardia , bronchial asthma or bronchial obstruction ; 2 ) patients with any acute illness or gastrointestinal diseases , especially those interfering with normal oral intake ; and 3 ) patients who were unable to follow the assessment plan .
after initial evaluation , the patients' parents who opted for oral propranolol therapy provided a thorough medical history ( e.g. , existence of comorbidities ) and family history ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease ) .
physical examination , baseline electrocardiogram ( ecg ) and echocardiogram were performed in all infants .
if cardiovascular abnormalities were detected , a pediatric cardiologist evaluated the patient to ensure that it was safe to initiate the propranolol treatment .
before treatment , the patients' parents were provided a handout on safety monitoring during the treatment phase and were instructed to ensure that their children were free to feed as often they desired ( at intervals not to exceed 4 - 6 hours ) .
all patients were scheduled for 24 hours of hospitalization for monitoring during initial propranolol treatment at day 0 with dose adjustments at days 7 and 28 .
propranolol was initiated at a dosage of 1.0 mg / kg per day divided 3 times daily for 1 week ( week 0 ) , which was then increased to 2 mg / kg per day divided 3 times daily from day 7 ( week 1 ) .
patients were administered the first dose of propranolol at 8:00 am. to avoid the risks of hypoglycemia , we requested that propranolol be administered within 30 min after the patients were fed .
during propranolol treatment , the doses were adjusted for weight gain ( 2 mg / kg per day ) .
heart rate ( hr ) , systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) , diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) and blood glucose ( bg ) values were the main outcome measures .
continuous bedside monitoring was performed on all infants during hospitalization by using a noninvasive multi - parameter monitor .
hr , sbp and dbp were obtained before ( baseline ) and at 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 hours following the first dose of propranolol therapy ( day 0 ) .
these values were also recorded before , and at 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 hours following the first dose of propranolol on week 1 ( day 7 ) and week 4 ( day 28 ) after dose escalation .
hypotension was defined as an sbp less than 50 mmhg and / or a dbp less than 30 mmhg18 , 19 .
bradycardia was defined as a hr less than 80 beats per minute ( bpm ) while awake or less than 60 bpm while asleep20 .
the bg level was measured by fingerstick using an automated glucometer , and obtained before ( baseline ) and 2 hours after the first dose of propranolol during hospitalization .
bg level was also monitored before ( baseline ) and 2 hours after the first dose of propranolol on days 7 and 28 .
hypoglycemia was defined as a bg level less than 40 mg / dl ( 2.2 mmol / l ) 21 .
in addition to the analysis described , the frequency of adverse events ( e.g. , sleep disturbance , cool or mottled extremities , poor appetite , diarrhea , pneumonia ) were reported by parents and collected by investigators during the follow - up examination ( 24 weeks ) .
statistical analyses of the study were conducted using spss 19.0 for windows ( spss inc. , chicago , il ) .
data are expressed as the mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) for all paired statistical comparisons .
independent t - tests were used to analyze the quantitative data .
p values less than 0.05 were considered significant .
results patient demographics and hemangioma characteristics of 78 potential participants , 51 met the inclusion criteria and were hospitalized solely for propranolol initiation for the treatment of ihs ( fig. 1 ) .
patient characteristics are summarized in table 1 .
there were 14 males and 37 females , with a male - to - female ratio of 1:2.64 .
the median age at the start of propranolol therapy was 19 days ( interquartile range , 15 - 24 days ) .
nineteen patients ( 37.3 %) were premature infants .
three patients ( 5.9 %) were treated with propranolol before reaching term equivalent age .
the patients' median weight at the time of propranolol initiation was 4.3 kg ( range 3.8 - 4.9 kg ) .
one patient weighted less than 2.5 kg at the time of propranolol initiation .
treatment indications for propranolol included : airway involvement and obstruction , vision compromise , bleeding and / or ulceration , feeding impairment , risk of permanent disfigurement or other high - risk ihs .
the head - face - neck area was the dominant location ( fig. 2a ) .
among ihs in the cohort , 29.4 % were of a segmental morphologic subtype ( fig. 2b ) .

figure 2 ( a ) the infantile hemangioma ( ih ) of this 26 - day - old female affected the right cheek , eyelid and orbit , causing visual field cut .
the lesion could proliferate , potentially resulting in permanent disfigurement and deprivation amblyopia .
( b ) the large , segmental ih of this 17 - day - old female affected the left sternum , upper arm and forearm .
this lesion had high a risk of ulceration and residual scarring .
four patients had a history of neonatal pneumonia .
the pneumonia in these patients resolved before their discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit .
two patients had a parental history of cardiovascular disease , but neither of them showed any ecg or echocardiogram abnormalities .
three patients had abnormal ecg findings , including 2 with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delays and 1 with a right bundle branch block .
six patients had 1 or more congenital heart defects on echocardiography , including 3 with atrial septal defect , one each with ventricular septal defect , patent ductus arteriosus , mild coarctation of the aortic and mild pulmonary valve stenosis .
the cardiologists allowed the administration of propranolol because these cardiac abnormalities are not absolute contraindications for the use of propranolol ( table 1 ) .
heart rate hr was carefully monitored during treatment .
there was a dramatic decrease in hr after the initiation of propranolol therapy .
mean hr decreases occurred within 1 hour and were most apparent at hour 2 during the first 8 hours ( fig. 3a ) .
then , the hr gradually increased but was still found to be lower than the level prior to treatment .
the mean levels of hr at hours 2 and 4 were statistically significant lower than baseline ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 , respectively ) .
in contrast , there was no statistically significant difference in mean hr between baseline and at hours 8 ( p > 0.05 ) .
all the decreases in mean hr were within normal limits , and all patients were clinically asymptomatic .
hr fluctuations were also observed after the first dose on days 7 and 28 .
interestingly , when patients were first administered propranolol at a dose of 2 mg / kg at week 1 ( day 7 ) , the hr decreased , but this decrease was less dramatic than was observed after the initiation of propranolol therapy on day 0 .
similar results were obtained after the second dose adjustment at week 4 ( day 28 ) .
hr fluctuations were less pronounced on days 7 and 28 than those observed on day 0 ( fig. 3b,c ) ( table 2 ) .

in contrast , we did not observe a significant decrease in mean dbp after the initiation of therapy ( fig. 4d ) .
both sbp and dbp became more stable from the first dose on day 7 onward .

discussion most ihs do not cause serious morbidities and mortality in patients with ih is extremely rare .
therefore , the great majority of patients with ihs will not need treatment .
accordingly , the current perception assumes that most ihs should be left untreated .
the treatment protocol of ' watchful waiting ' ( or initial observation ) was considered and is still frequently encountered in clinical practice .
unfortunately , approximately 25 - 69 % of patients with ih may develop a residual lesion after complete involution of the ih22 .
in addition , a significant minority of ihs can cause permanent disfigurement or functional compromise .
therefore , the risk - benefit analysis of any management must be scrutinized thoroughly , keeping in mind that a ' watchful waiting ' strategy might often be appropriate , but in certain cases , timely intervention is crucial in minimizing long - term sequelae .
young infants may have a greater likelihood of intolerance of hemodynamic changes than older children and adults .
clinically , there is controversy concerning the use of propranolol in young infants .
many studies did not include children who were younger than 30 days .
in this study , we successfully provided clinical evidence of the safety and tolerability of propranolol in young infants with problematic ih. previously , several large case series of patients treated with propranolol included infants younger than 30 days of age and / or premature infants , but no additional information on these patients was given .
in this study , 37.3 % of patients were premature infants .
the median age of our patients at initial propranolol treatment was 19 days .
thus , the majority of our patients began treatment before or during the most rapid growth phase of ih. remarkably , it has been demonstrated that facial ihs are 1.7 times more likely and segmental ihs are 11.0 times more likely to develop complications23 .
therefore , the ihs in our cohort had a high risk for morbidity according to the anatomical location and / or the morphology of the hemangioma , which implied a great need for therapy .
accurate measurement of hr and bp in neonates is sometimes difficult .
the continuous bedside monitoring provided an accurate method for measuring hr and bp over long periods .
this technique does not seriously interfere with normal behavior , and therefore , documentation of changes in hr and bp is possible during activities such as sleeping and is likely to provide more reliable information .
in keeping with previous studies , we found that the effects of propranolol on hr in infants peaked approximately 2 hours after every oral dose24 .
not surprisingly , and consistent with its use as an antihypertensive , during propranolol administration , there was a drop in blood pressure that persisted .
although the decreases in mean sbp were statistically significant , and 5.9 % of our patients developed transient hypotension , all of the patients remained clinically asymptomatic .
these data provided strong evidence that propranolol did not have a dramatic and persistent effect on hemodynamics in selected young infants .
although rare , symptomatic hypoglycemia can be a serious complication of propranolol treatment .
the exact mechanism or mechanisms by which propranolol exerts its influence on bg are not fully understood .
it is conceivable that propranolol may block catecholamine - induced lipolysis , glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis , which may facilitate hypoglycemia in children25 .
young infants have lower glycogen stores .
they are reliant upon their caregivers for their sustenance .
in the present study , all of our infants were frequent feeders .
remarkably , our data demonstrated that there was no statistically significant decrease in bg with propranolol therapy in our patients .
this finding is exciting and suggests that parental education on medication regimens and frequent feeding may be effective in preventing episodes of hypoglycemia in young infants .
our data demonstrated that propranolol was generally well tolerated in young infants .
however , it should be stressed that the satisfying results obtained in this study were based on the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria .
although some of our patients had associated cardiac abnormalities , none of them had contraindications for the use of propranolol .
in addition , none of our patients had acute illnesses or conditions that would have interfered with normal oral intake .
these strict inclusion criteria could largely reduce the possibility of hemodynamic risk in young infants .
on the other hand , recent studies have demonstrated that preterm infants with very low birth weight were more likely to be susceptible to the adverse effects of beta - blockers26 , 27 .
the authors of these studies suggested that beta - blockers should always be cautiously administered in these patients .
in addition , caution should also be used when treating young infants who had a history of apnea or bradycardia .
in this study , the appearance of bronchial hyperreactivity in 2 patients was remarkable , suggesting that young infants ( less than 30 days of age ) who had a history of neonatal pneumonia appeared to be at higher risk for respiratory side effects .
it is recognized that neonatal pneumonia can result in persistent alterations in lung function and airway responsiveness28 .
there is evidence that the potential risk of bronchial hyperreactivity was increased after infantile pneumonia29 .
for these potential high - risk infants , we propose brief inpatient hospitalization for monitoring during the induction of propranolol treatment or required dose modification .
conclusions in conclusion , this study provided valuable data regarding the effects of propranolol on hemodynamics and bg levels in young infants .
our findings support the fact that oral propranolol administered on a progressive schedule was safe and well tolerated in properly selected young patients .

background this study focuses on poly - victimization , with the aim of providing a realistic estimation of the prevalence of lifetime victimization in a norwegian adolescent population ( ages 18 - 19 years ) .
methods based upon the concept from previous research , we applied measures of child poly - victimization on norwegian data obtained from a national youth survey in 2015 ( n = 4,531 ) to arrive at an estimation of its prevalence .
we used variables that measure individual characteristics such as gender and educational aspiration and socio - economic factors such as parents' education level and home economic situation to derive a social and psychological profile of victimization and poly - victimization among young people .
finally , we estimated the effects of poly - victimization on mental health such as symptoms of depression , anxiety and trauma .
results our study identified a poly - victimization prevalence of 8.6 % among young people , i.e. they were exposed to three of all four forms of violence investigated by our study : non - physical violence , witnessing violence against parents , physical violence and sexual abuse .
adolescents of poly - victimization are six times more likely to report depression and anxiety and trauma when compared with those without victimization .
conclusions poly - victimization is a phenomenon that heavily burdens many young people across many national contexts .
poly - victims clearly tend to develop depression , anxiety , and posttraumatic stress symptoms .
the early detection of sexual abuse , physical violence , and bullying victimization is of critical importance and preventive measures could consider addressing family factors through parental educational programs .

introduction children who are exposed to one type of maltreatment are often also victims of other types of violence , as different forms of victimization tend to repeat and co - occur [ 1 - 4 ] .
research on increased exposure to different types of childhood adversities indicates that there is a corresponding increase in the rates of mental health problems [ 5 ] .
poly - victimization is a concept proposed and conceptualized to describe the situation where a child or adolescent has been exposed to high levels of different types of victimization [ 6 , 7 ] .
over the past decade , we have witnessed the development of various concepts and methodological approaches that estimate various risk factors associated with children who are victims of maltreatment and violence .
musicaro et al. , [ 8 ] offers a clarification of the terminology on recurrent interpersonal victimization by designating how cumulative trauma theory emphasizes the relationship between the frequency and severity of victimization which posits a linear association between the number of types of traumatic events and the severity of clinical impairment .
in the research literature , we find two concepts used to describe children and youth who have been exposed to more than one type of violence : poly - victimization and multiple victimization [ 9 - 14 ] .
the concept of poly - victimization first emerged from a series on the developmental victimization survey ( dvs ) , which was administered to a nationally representative sample of 2,030 children aged 2 - 17 years living in the united states [ 7 ] .
finkelhor and associates [ 2 , 6 , 7 , 15 ] developed several measures of poly - victimization based on their ability to predict trauma symptoms , which represent one of the most important correlates of , and reasons for , identifying poly - victimization .
poly - victimization was originally defined as " the experiencing of four or more different types of victimization in different incidents in a given year " [ 6 , 7 ] which includes children who have experienced victimization levels above the mean number of 3.0 victimizations identified by the survey .
eventually , finkelhor and colleagues [ 15 ] proposed identifying poly - victimization as involving the 10 % of children who experienced the highest numbers of different types of victimizations , such as sexual abuse , physical abuse , bullying , and exposure to family violence. by this definition , they emphasize that measures of poly - victimization should include different kinds of victimization instead of multiple episodes of the same kind of victimization [ 15 ] .
this is in accordance with the definition that we apply in this study .
measures of prevalence in previous research the use of the term poly - victimization has quickly evolved and it now distinguishes between childhood poly - victimization , lifetime poly - victimization , and recent ( in the past year ) poly - victimization .
in the united states , the findings of the dvs ( n = 2,030 ; respondents were between the ages of 2 - 17 years ) estimated that the prevalence of poly - victimization ( i.e. those who experienced at least four types of victimization ) was 22 % among children aged 2 - 17 years. of these respondents , 15 % experienced low poly - victimization ( four to six types of victimization ) and 7 % experienced high poly - victimization ( seven or more types of victimization )[ 7 ] .
meanwhile , another study conducted in the us ( the natscev ii study ) estimated that 17.8 % of children and adolescents between the ages of 10 - 17 years belonged to a latent group of poly - victims who had been victimized in multiple settings , by different perpetrators , in incidents involving weapons and sexual violence [ 4 ] .
several prevalence studies of poly - victimization have been conducted in other countries using representative samples and substantial adaptation of the juvenile victimization questionnaire ( jvq ) [ 7 ] , e.g. in the united kingdom [ 16 ] , in spain [ 17 ] , in canada [ 18 ] , in sweden [ 19 ] .
we observe in the literature a lack of consensus in terms of both the measurement of poly - victimization and the ' cutoff ' point that determines who can qualify as a poly - victim .
there are a variety of definitions and measurements used with respect to the term poly - victimization .
some researchers choose to use a specific number of victimization types e.g. [ 6 , 17 ] to construct the concept of poly - victimization while others take into account victimization contexts [ e.g. 4 ] or numbers of events [ e.g. 19 ] .
moreover , various study results show an accumulation of poly - victimization that occurs from childhood to adulthood and in these instances , the numbers and types of victimization increase in association with age .
nonetheless , there is the claim of a strong linear relationship between poly - victimization and mental health over both the short term and long term [ 20 ] .
children are negatively affected in many ways by experiences of maltreatment , abuse , and neglect [ 21 ] .
this study will apply the concept and previous measures of poly - victimization with a norwegian adolescent population sample .
we will test our hypothesis that the same linear association between poly - victimization and mental health also can be found in the norwegian context .
data and methods procedure a national youth survey conducted in spring 2015 in norway , known as ungvold 2015 study , was designed to assess the prevalence of offences and violence committed against children and adolescents [ 22 ] .
this survey used a stratified random sample of all third - year students in 49 schools .
all third - year students were invited to complete a questionnaire on an individual computer during school hours with a teacher present .
complying with the personal data act ( act of 14 april 2000 no .
31 relating to the processing of personal data ) s 33 and s 34 , this research was approved by the norwegian data protection authority ( nsd ) 14 / 01407 - 5 / eol before data collection .
then we contacted sampled schools to obtain permission at the school level for conducting the survey .
students at each school then gave their consent to participate in the survey after receiving clear written information of the themes and purpose of the study .
in both written information to schools and to individual students , it was emphasized that it was voluntary to participate and all answers would be anonymous .
the anonymity of the survey was further safeguarded both at school and individual levels in a way that we did not request any direct or indirect person - identification data .
as the topics in the questionnaire were sensitive and could awaken unpleasant memories or feelings in the respondents , we provided information about where and whom ( counselor or health sister at school ) the respondents could seek help from , both at the start of the survey and at the last page of the survey questionnaire .
participants of the 6,848 students invited , 4,530 students completed the survey , which yielded a sufficient response rate of 66 % .
a few factors contributed to this response rate : 1 ) students could refuse to participate in the study , as per norwegian research ethic regulations ; 18 - year - old students can determine whether they wish to consent to participate in research ; 2 ) unfortunately , some of the students may not have been at school during the ungvold 2015 data collection period .
this latter point was especially true for male students , who were mostly completing field practice during their last year of upper - secondary education .
after conducting some preliminary data analyses , we did not observe any systematically missing data from the ungvold 2015 survey .
most of the respondents ( 93.7 %) were 18 - 19 years of age at the time of the survey and 59 % were female .
nevertheless , our data featured some limitations with regard to our ability to estimate the prevalence rate of victimization and the representativeness of the norwegian youth in this age group .
as this was an upper - secondary school based survey , the sample under - represented ( or , unfortunately , excluded ) two groups of young people .
first , approximately 2 % of norwegian young people do not attend upper - secondary school education upon completion of compulsory education .
second , approximately 30 % of norwegian upper - secondary school students drop out of school between the first and last years of their education [ 23 ] .
measures of non - physical , witness of domestic violence , physical , and sexual abuse the ungvold 2015 survey obtained data on four major forms of offences against children : 1 ) non - physical violence ( severe verbal bullying , threat of violence ) perpetrated by parents and / or peers ; 2 ) witnessing non - physical and physical violence against their parents by parents' partners ; 3 ) physical violence ( slap with open hands , fists , or being " beaten up ") perpetrated by parents or peers ; and 4 ) sexual abuse ( unwanted touching , exposure , or sexual acts ) perpetrated by adults in or out the family and / or by peers .
the study differentiated between offences committed by adults and those by peers both before and / or after the student reached the age of 13 - 14 years .

0 = never1 = once2 = a few times 0 = never1 = once2 = a few times note : * violence experienced at home ( parents ) has a response alternative for those younger than 14 years old and those older than 14 years old .
measures of non - physical abuse include the following sub - categories : 1 ) verbal bullying and threats of violence perpetrated by peers overall , before and after the age of 13 years ; and 2 ) verbal bullying and threats of violence perpetrated by parents .
witness violence includes witnessing verbal abuse between parents and witnessing physical violence between parents overall , before and after the age of 14 years .
measures of physical violence include 1 ) being beaten or injured by peers , siblings , or other young strangers ; and 2 ) physical abuse perpetrated by parents overall , before and after the age of 14 years .
measures of sexual abuse include items of unwanted sexual events overall , before and after the age of 13 years .
these instances of abuse were captured in a question asking students if they had experienced any of these events against their wills .
analysis plan we analyzed measures of victimization using the framework of four forms of violence - - i.e. , non - physical violence ( verbal or psychological abuse ) , witnessing violence against parents , physical violence , and sexual abuse .
we first identified a poly - victimization group that experienced all four forms of violence by counting all instances where the respondents chose the response options ' once ' or ' more times' on those items that measured physical and sexual abuse , while excluding items measuring non - physical / verbal abuse that happened only ' once ' .
we then looked into compositions of poly - victimization that were most commonly experienced during each life phase ( childhood or adolescence ) in our group .
furthermore , we provided a social and psychological profile of the adolescents who were exposed to violence and poly - victimization .
indicators for the adolescents' social profile included individual characteristics such as gender , country of birth , school achievement , and educational aspirations , as well as home background variables such as parents' education and employment , whether or not the parents were living together , and home economic situation .
home economic situation was a subjective measure that was captured by asking ' has your family had a good or bad economic situation in the past two years ? ?
on a six - point scale , with responses ranging from ' 1 ' ( a lot ups and downs ) , ' 2 ' ( bad economy all the time ) , ' 3 ' ( bad economy most of the time ) , ' 4 ' ( neither good or bad ) , ' 5 ' ( good economy most of the time ) , and ' 6 ' ( good economy all of the time ) .
we combined ratings of ' 2 ' and ' 3 ' to create a group variable termed as ' home has bad economy ' which was coded as ' 1 ' and all other scenarios were coded as ' 0 ' .
a full version of the hopkins symptom checklist ( hscl ) [ 24 ] , which features 26 items , served as an indicator of the young people 's mental health profiles .
the internal consistency of these subscales has appeared to be good and cronbach 's alpha range between 0.81 and 0.92 for depression , and between 0.82 and 0.87 for anxiety in population samples in norway , denmark , finland and germany [ 25 ] .
the 26 - item hscl measures the level of depression and anxiety experienced over the last week on a four - point scale , with responses including 1 = ' not troubled at all ' , 2 = ' a little troubled ' , 3 = ' troubled quite a lot ' , and 4 = ' very much troubled ' .
the depression and anxiety variable is an average score that is obtained from the sum of the 26 hscl items ( mean = 1.66 , std = 0.57 ) .
higher values indicate poorer mental health .
a short screening scale was used to measure posttraumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) [ 26 ] .
the short screening scale for ptsd is a seven - item checklist that features ' tick - box ' responses indicating whether the respondent had experienced certain symptoms during the past month .
a score of 4 or greater on this scale defined positive cases of ptsd with a sensitivity of 80 % , specificity of 97 % , positive predictive value of 71 % , and negative predictive value of 98 % .
a ptsd score is constructed by adding all of the items that had been selected ; responses ranged from 1 - 7 ( mean = 0.74 , std = 1.50 ) .
finally , we used logistic analysis technique to estimate the effect of poly - victimization on the mental health of young people .
we consider regression coefficients produced by linear regression analysis are difficult to interpret since most of the variables used in the study are categorical .
for the sake of clear interpretation in a pedagogical way , we choose to use logistic regression analysis as it can provide odds ratio ( or ) of each increase of the types of victimization on young peoples' ' membership ' into poor mental health .
we constructed a ' poor mental health ' group of young people , as indicated by the hscl value ; moreover , a ptsd value >= 2 is higher than the whole group means by 0.5 standard deviation ( i.e. , 1.90 for hscl and 1.51 for ptsd ) .
moreover , we consider a value of 2 in hscl to be appropriate , as it represents the response alternative ' 2 = ' a little troubled ' on all hscl symptom items while a value of 2 corresponds to two symptoms listed in dsm - iv. analysis and results prevalence of victimization types table 2 presents the prevalence of all types of victimization that occurred during two phases of the young people 's lives - - i.e. , victimization during childhood ( before the age of 13 or 14 years ) and adolescence ( at and after the age of 14 years ) - reported by the same participants .

our measures show that 62.5 % of young people in norway have experienced any form of victimization during their lifetime up to the ages of 18 - 19 years .
our analysis identified that 8.6 % of young people in the group experienced poly - victimization ( i.e. , victimization of all four forms of violence , as investigated by the ungvold study ) .
meanwhile , one quarter of all young people ( 25 %) were exposed to two forms violence and nearly one third ( 29 %) of norwegian adolescents were exposed to a single form of violence during their lives as children and adolescents .
when examining individual categories , the highest prevalence was noted for victimization of verbal bullying perpetrated by peers ( 40.5 %) ; most of these cases occurred before the age of 13 years ( 36.2 %) .
following this , substantial proportions of youth witnessed verbal abuse between parents ( 24.9 %) ; moreover , they experienced physical violence perpetrated by parents ( 20.6 %) and by peers ( 18.8 %) , and they also experienced sexual abuse ( 19.6 %). from the analyses presented in table 2 , we observe that the prevalence of victimization in all forms and types tends to decrease from childhood to adolescence , with the exception of sexual abuse .
for example , verbal bullying by peers decreased from 36.2 % before the age of 13 years to 25.6 % after the age of 13 years , while physical abuse by peers decreased from 15.2 % to 10.3 % during the same periods .
moreover , we also observed that there was an overlap in victimization during childhood and adolescence , which indicates the continuation of victimization from childhood into adolescence for some young people .
for example , 21.3 % of young people were verbally bullied by their peers during both childhood and adolescence while 3.7 % of young people were exposed to sexual abuse both during childhood and adolescence .
estimations of the prevalence of poly - victimization as the ungvold data measure four forms of violence perpetrated by adults and peers during the two life phases of young people ( childhood and adolescence ) , we identified 12 situations of victimization ( see s1 to s12 in table 2 , first column from the left ) by counting , for example , non - physical violence perpetrated by peers before the age of 13 years as one situation of victimization ( s1 ) , and any other victimization events that occurred after the age of 13 years as another situation of victimization ( s2 ) .
physical abuse perpetrated by parents up until the age of 13 years was counted as one situation of victimization ( s9 ) , and that which occurred after the age of 13 years was regarded as another ( s10 ) .
in this way , we arrived at a number of total victimizations that ranged from 0 - 12 with a mean of 1.87 ( std = 2.21 ) .
when we applied finkelhor et al. ' s [ 6 ] definition of poly - victimization ( with three or more victimization situations ) , which was established using the number of victimizations above the mean ( i.e. , 2 in our case ) , it had a prevalence of 19.8 % in norway. by counting victimization as exposure to violence in four forms ( non - physical , witnessing , physical , and sexual ) , we identified that 17.6 % of norwegian adolescents were poly - victims ( i.e. , those who were exposed to three or all four forms of violence ) .
table 2 also presents the composition of poly - victimization by showing the proportions of each type and each situation of victimization included in this definition .
it is evident that each victimization types in each of the situations investigated in our study had disproportionately contributed to the poly - victimization group .
for example , 36.2 % of youths were exposed to non - physical violence perpetrated by peers before the age of 13 years , while 76.5 % of the poly - victims had experienced this situation of victimization .
moreover , 13.7 % of the young people were exposed to physical violence that was perpetrated by their parents during adolescence ( and after the age of 14 years ) , while three times more ( 48.2 %) poly - victims had experienced this situation of victimization .
finally , 6 % of norwegian youth were exposed to sexual abuse during childhood , while among those who had experienced poly - victimization 20.9 % had been exposed to sexual abuse .
several types and situations of victimization account for the largest proportions of poly - victimization ; for instance , most respondents who experienced victimization faced peer verbal bullying ( 84.4 % in total ) during childhood ( 76.5 %) and adolescent ( 62 %) , followed by witnessing parents been verbally abused ( 77.5 %) , and physical abuse perpetrated by parents ( 67.5 % in total ) during childhood ( 58.2 %) and adolescence ( 48.2 %) .
eventually , our analyses showed that both calculation methods yielded rather similar estimations of poly - victimization ( see the last row at the bottom of table 2 ) in cases where poly - victimization included all four forms of violence ; there was an average number of five types and situations of victimization ( mean = 5.57 , std = 1.89 ) , which was referred to as ' high poly - victimization ' .
meanwhile , the group that experienced two forms of violence ( second column from the right in table 2 ) also experienced between 2 - 4 situations of victimization overall ( mean = 2.86 , std = 0.98 ) , which we can refer to as ' low poly - victimization ' .

for percentage differences between the groups , we performed chi - squared test while for mean differences between groups , we performed independent t - test .
* indicates that the difference between ' poly - victimization ' and ' non - victimization ' is statistically significant at the 0.05 level .
when compared with youth who were never exposed to any form of violence or abuse ( second column in table 3 ) , young people who experienced poly - victimization were overrepresented by girls ( 67.9 % versus 55.5 % in the non - victimization group ) , and by those whose families lived in houses provided by the welfare system ( 10.2 % versus 6.1 % in the non - victimization group ) .
young people who faced poly - victimization were also disproportionately from disadvantaged homes with bad economic situations , as perceived by the young respondents ( 43.3 % versus 18.8 % in the non - victimization group ) ; moreover , 48.3 % were living in homes where their parents were living together , while 71.3 % of those in the non - victimization group had parents who were living together .
in addition , fewer parents from the poly - victimization group had received higher education ( 38.5 % of fathers and 52.1 % of mothers ) when compared with the parents in the non - victimization group , 44.6 % of fathers and 56.2 % of mothers had higher education .
moreover , more parents in the poly - victimization group were unemployed ( 22.6 % of fathers and 23.3 % of mothers ) , while 12.6 % of fathers and 14.5 % of mothers in the non - victimization group were unemployed at the time of the survey .
most importantly , young people in the poly - victimization group were substantially more likely to have parents with a substance abuse problem ( 25.8 % of fathers and 11.1 % of mothers ) when compared with those in the non - victimization group with 6.8 % of fathers and 4 % of mothers dealing substance abuse .
several individual and social characteristics did not exhibit significant differences between the poly - victimization group and the non - victimization group , such as respondents' and parents' birth countries , young people 's school achievements , and young people 's educational aspirations .
however , in the poly - victimization group , we did observe a clear increase in depression and anxiety symptoms ( mean = 2.07 , std = 0.63 ) when compared with the non - victimization group ( mean = 1.42 , std = 0.44 ) .
ptsd symptoms were also greater in the poly - victimization group ( mean = 1.66 , std = 2.08 ) than in the non - victimization group ( mean = 0.31 , std = 0.92 ) .
the differences of both hscl and ptsd between the group of poly - victimization and the non - victimization group are statistically significant ( see table 3 ) .
the association between poly - victimization and mental health table 4 presents the results of the logistic regression analysis of young people 's exposure to poly - victimization ; it was found that poly - victimization predicted the youth 's recent mental health , as indicated by depression and anxiety symptoms , and by posttraumatic stress , reaching a value of 2 and higher .

as shown in table 4 , we applied two models respectively , to predict depression and anxiety , and to predict ptsd .
model 1 includes only background variables and model 2 includes the independent variable for victimization while keeping the background variables constant .
among all of the background variables included in the models - - gender , being born in norway , having a father with a substance abuse problem , and living in a home with a poor economic situation - - all significantly increased the odds of having poor mental health .
females were four and a half times more likely than their male counterparts to have depression and anxiety symptoms ( or = 4.54 ) , and they were twice more likely to have ptsd ( or = 2.24 ) .
young people who were born in norway were 60 % more likely to exhibit depression and anxiety symptoms ( or = 1.60 ) and they were 69 % more likely than those who were not born in norway to have posttraumatic stress ( or = 1.69 ) .
having a father with a substance abuse problem increased the odds of having depression and anxiety by 32 % ( or = 1.32 ) , and these respondents were 17 % more likely to have posttraumatic stress ( or = 1.17 ) when the poly - victimization variable was not included in the model .
living at a home with a poor economic situation significantly increased the odds of facing poor mental health by 70 % when depression and anxiety symptoms were present ( or = 1.70 ) and by 38 % when posttraumatic stress was evident ( or = 1.38 ) .
nevertheless , a couple of background variables did have some protective effects on the mental health of young people .
for instance , aspiring to attend higher education decreased the odds of depression and anxiety by 18 % , while it reduced the odds of posttraumatic stress by 21 % ( or = 0.79 ) ; similarly , having a mother who attained a higher education also reduced the likelihood of developing posttraumatic stress by 18 % ( or = 0.82 in model 2 ) .
the analysis of model 2 for both hscl and ptsd presented in table 4 shows strong and significant effects of victimization on the mental health of young people .
first , victimization of single forms of violence nearly doubles the odds of depression and anxiety ( or = 2.01 ) and posttraumatic stress ( or = 1.74 ) .
second , victimization of two forms of violence ( referred to as ' low poly - victimization ') increased the odds of depression and anxiety by nearly four times ( or = 3.80 ) , and the odds of experiencing posttraumatic stress increased by more than three times ( or = 3.34 ) .
third , poly - victimization had the strongest detrimental effect on the mental health of young people , as it increased the odds of experiencing depression and anxiety symptoms by six times ( or = 5.99 ) ; it also increased the chances of developing posttraumatic stress by nearly six times ( or = 5.66 ) .
discussion and conclusion when applying the two calculation methods to identify the lifetime prevalence of poly - victimization in a young norwegian population , both methods yielded rather similar estimates .
our study identified a poly - victimization prevalence of 8.6 % among young people , i.e. they were exposed to three of and all four forms of violence investigated by our study : non - physical violence , witnessing violence against parents , physical violence and sexual abuse .
this group experienced an average number of six types and situations of victimization .
the prevalence of poly - victimization estimated from our sample is rather similar to those found in sweden [ 19 ] and canada [ 18 ] , but the rate is different from those reported by a spanish study [ 17 ] .
when applying the definition of finkelhor and associates [ 15 ] , where poly - victimization should account for 10 % of young people who were exposed to the highest numbers of victimization in the sample , our data indicated that this group ( 10 % of young people ) had been exposed to 5 - 12 types and situations of victimization .
our study provided another piece of evidence highlighting that poly - victimization is also a phenomenon that heavily burdens many young people outside a north american context .
poly - victimization includes all types and situations of victimization investigated in our study , but certain types and situations of victimization contributed the most in this group : experiencing sexual abuse during adolescence , undergoing peer verbal bullying during childhood and adolescence , witnessing parents being verbally abused , and facing physical abuse perpetrated by parents .
the association found between poly - victimization and mental health supports the idea that there is a cumulative impact of childhood adversities where increased exposure to multiple victimizing events increases the risk for various mental health problems .
poly - victims clearly tend to develop depression , anxiety , and posttraumatic stress symptoms .
our analysis results show how those who experience victimization of three of and all four forms of violence - - i.e. , non - physical violence , physical violence , those who witness violence at home , and those who experience sexual abuse - - are six times more likely to report depression and anxiety .
moreover , they are also six times more likely to describe having posttraumatic stress symptoms when compared with those adolescents in the non - victimization group .
our finding of a cumulative impact is in accordance with the findings of other studies [ 19 , 27 ] .
when compared with other young people who did not experience any victimization , the young people in the poly - victimization group identified in our study appeared to share a distinctive profile in terms of both their sociodemographic and mental health variables .
those in the poly - victimization group are overrepresented by girls ; they are more likely to be from disadvantaged homes with bad economic situations , and they tend to have separated parents , unemployed parents and parents who engage in substance abuse .
these individual and sociodemographic characteristics may be burdens in and of themselves , and they appear to reinforce the subsequent emergence of maladjustment .
the strong increase in the risk of developing anxiety and depression for each added form of victimization is a clear indication that the early detection of sexual abuse , physical violence , and bullying victimization is of critical importance .
for every new victimization experience , individuals become increasingly more vulnerable to becoming the target for new offenders. by providing distinctive sociodemographic and psychological profiles of those young people who are more likely to experience poly - victimization , the results of our study point to some of the risk factors .
in fact , the more that youth experience different types of victimizing situation , the smaller the change that these individuals will have access to a secure retreat .
if a youth runs the risk of being polyvictimized preventive measures are important .
studies to identify the risks of being exposed to polyvictimization have so far indicated that many of these are to be found at a systemic level [ 5 ] .
the implication of this is that implementation of preventive measures should target changes at systemic level , i.e. beyond individual factors by providing a safe environment for our young people .
limitations of the study as a national youth survey , our study has data limitations with regard to the interpretations of the prevalence and consequences of the poly - victimization among norwegian youth as it is stated in previous section " data and methods " .
although several measures were taken to assure the respondents both confidentiality and access to psychological counselling in answering such sensitive questions , researchers feared under - reporting due to the under - representation of specific groups and suppressed memory or memory loss of childhood abusive experiences when the respondents were asked to recall events from their childhood [ 22 ] .

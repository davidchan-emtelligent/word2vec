recent evidence showed the role of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( ppars ) in cardiac function .
cardiac contraction induced by various agents is critical in restoring the activity of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors delta ( ppardelta ) in cardiac myopathy .
because dobutamine is an agent widely used to treat heart failure in emergency setting , this study is aimed to investigate the change of ppardelta in response to dobutamine .
neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were used to examine the effects of dobutamine on ppardelta expression levels and cardiac troponin i ( ctni ) phosphorylation via western blotting analysis .
we show that treatment with dobutamine increased ppardelta expression and ctni phosphorylation in a time - and dose - dependent manner in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes .
these increases were blocked by the antagonist of beta1 - adrenoceptors .
also , the action of dobutamine was related to the increase of calcium ions and diminished by chelating intracellular calcium .
additionally , dobutamine - induced action was reduced by the inhibition of downstream messengers involved in this calcium - related pathway .
moreover , deletion of ppardelta using sirna generated the reduction of ctni phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes treated with dobutamine .
thus , we concluded that ppardelta is increased by dobutamine in cardiac cells .
1. introduction dobutamine is one of the most widely used agents for heart failure in clinic settings [ 1 ] .
dobutamine acts through the activation of beta1 - adrenoceptor which is linked to a guanine nucleotide regulatory cascade via heterotrimeric g proteins .
this activation results in an increase of adenylyl cyclase activity for the conversion of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) to cyclic amp ( camp ) .
an increase in intracellular camp concentration causes the release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum .
this increased calcium is used by contractile proteins to increase stroke volume [ 2 - 6 ] .
troponin i ( tni ) is an inhibitory unit of the troponin complex associated with thin filaments and acts by inhibiting actomyosin interactions in the presence of low levels of intracellular calcium ions ( ca2 +) during diastole [ 7 , 8 ] .
modulation of myofilament properties via changes in tni phosphorylation has profound effects on cardiac contractility and pumping [ 9 ] .
phosphorylation of tni by protein kinase a results in a reduction in myofilament sensitivity to ca2 + and an increase in the cross - bridge cycling rate , resulting in the acceleration of relaxation and an increase in power output , but a reduced economy of contraction [ 8 , 9 ] .
ca2 + is involved in muscle contraction and is an intracellular messenger that activates a wide variety of cellular responses including gene transcription [ 7 - 10 ] .
various studies have shown that the activation of calcineurin ( cn ) and calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ( camk ) signaling pathways serves a major role in the regulation of gene expression in cardiac muscles [ 11 , 12 ] .
these same genes have been shown to also be regulated by peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( ppars ) [ 13 ] .
ppars are ligand - activated transcription factors that regulate expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation [ 13 ] .
the three subtypes of ppars ( pparalpha , ppargamma , and ppardelta ) modulate expression of different genes and exert various bioactivities [ 13 ] .
previous studies also showed that metabolic modulators can have beneficial effects in both experimental and clinical heart failure settings [ 14 ] .
ppardelta - dependent maintenance of cardiac function is crucial for cardiomyocytes [ 15 - 17 ] .
the deletion of cardiac ppardelta results in decreased contraction , increased left ventricular end - diastolic pressure , lowered cardiac output , and increased incidences of cardiac failure [ 15 ] .
our previous study demonstrated that digoxin enhanced cardiac output by increasing ppardelta expression [ 18 ] .
dobutamine is the widely used cardiac agent for patients with heart failure .
however , the theory is that the action of dobutamine occurs via the activation of ppardelta remained obscure .
in this study , we used the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to investigate the role of ppardelta in dobutamine - induced action .
moreover , we determined the possible signaling pathways for increase of ppardelta induced by dobutamine .

antibodies to cardiac tni and phospho - tni ( ser 23 / 24 ) were purchased from cell signaling technology ( beverly , ma , usa ) .
2.2 .
cell culture primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared by the modification of a previously described method [ 14 ] .
briefly , under anesthesia with 2 % isoflurane , hearts of 1 - to - 2 - day - old wistar rats were excised , cut into 1 - 2 mm pieces , and predigested with trypsin to remove red blood cells .
the heart tissue was then digested with 0.25 % trypsin and 0.05 % collagenase .
the dissociated cells were placed in uncoated 100 mm dishes and incubated at 37degreesc in a 5 % co2 incubator for at least 1 hour to remove the nonmyocytic cells .
this procedure caused fibroblasts to predominantly attach to the dishes while most of the cardiomyocytes remained in suspension .
the cardiomyocyte - enriched population was collected and counted .
the cells were cultured in dulbecco / vogt modified eagle 's minimal essential medium ( dmem ) with 1 mmol / l pyruvate , 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) , 100 units / ml penicillin , and 100 units / ml streptomycin .
over 95 % of the collected cells were characterized cardiomyocytes on the basis of the sarcomeric myosin content .
on the second day , the medium was replaced .
after 3 to 4 days in culture , the cells were exposed to hyperglycemic conditions .
the high glucose - treated cardiomyocytes were generated by applying 30 mmol / l glucose to the cells for 24 hours [ 14 ] .
this animal experiment was approved and conducted in accordance with local institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals in the chi - mei medical center ( number 100052307 ) and followed the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals published by the u.s. national institutes of health ( nih publication number 85 - 23 , revised 1996 ) , as well as the guidelines of the animal welfare act .
2.3 .
drug treatment of cardiomyocytes stock solutions of dobutamine were prepared with normal media .
cells were treated with varying concentrations of dobutamine ( 0.01 - 10 mumol / l ) for 4 hours , washed twice with pbs , and removed by trypsinization .
the treated cells were then collected and subjected to a gene expression assay .
in addition , pretreatment with various inhibitory agents ( beta1 - adenocepotor antagonist ( 10 mumol / l atenolol ) [ 19 , 20 ] , beta2 - adenocepotor antagonist ( 10 mumol / l butoxamine ) [ 21 ] , calcium chelator ( 25 mmol / l bapta - am ) , calcineurin inhibitor ( 1 mumol / l cyclosporine a ) [ 22 ] , or camk inhibitor ( 1 mumol / l kn - 93 ) [ 22 ]) was applied for 30 minutes before the addition of dobutamine .
2.4 .
western blotting analysis protein was extracted from tissue homogenates and cell lysates using ice - cold radio - immunoprecipitation assay ( ripa ) buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors ( 50 mmol / l sodium vanadate , 0.5 mmol / l phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride , 2 mg / ml aprotinin , and 0.5 mg / ml leupeptin ) .
protein concentrations were determined with the bio - rad protein assay ( bio - rad laboratories , inc. , hercules , ca , usa ) .
total protein ( 30 mug ) was separated by sds / polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 10 % acrylamide gel ) using the bio - rad mini - protein ii system .
protein was transferred to expanded polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( pierce , rockford , il , usa ) with a bio - rad trans - blot system .
after the transfer , the membranes were washed with pbs and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with 5 % ( w / v ) nonfat dry milk ( nfdm ) in pbs .
blots were incubated overnight at 4degreesc with an immunoglobulin - g polyclonal rabbit anti - mouse antibody ( affinity bioreagents , inc. , golden , co , usa ) diluted 1 : 500 in 5 % ( w / v ) nfdm dissolved in pbs / tween 20 ( 0.5 % by volume ) .
the blots were also incubated with goat polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) targeted to actin , which served as an internal control .
after the removal of the primary antibody , the blots were extensively washed with pbs / tween 20 .
the blots were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with the appropriate peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 5 % ( w / v ) nfdm dissolved in pbs / tween 20 .
the blots were developed by autoradiography using the ecl - western blotting system ( amersham international , buckinghamshire , uk ) .
the immunoblots were quantified with a laser densitometer .
2.5 .
measurement of intracellular calcium concentration the changes in intracellular calcium were detected using the fluorescent probe fura2 - am [ 23 ] .
primary cultured cardiomyocytes were placed in a buffered physiological saline solution containing 140 mmol / l nacl , 5.9 mmol / l kcl , 1.2 mmol / l cacl2 , 1.4 mmol / l mgcl2 , 11.5 mmol / l glucose , 1.8 mmol / l na2hpo4 , and 10 mmol / l hepes - tris .
a final concentration of 5 mumol / l fura - 2am was added to the cells which were incubated for 1 hour in humidified 5 % co2 and 95 % air at 37degreesc .
the cells were washed and incubated for an additional 30 minutes in pss .
the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were inserted into a thermostatic ( 37degreesc ) cuvette containing 2 ml of calcium - free pss and various doses of dobutamine or inhibitor as previously indicated .
the fluorescence was continuously recorded using a fluorescence spectrofluorometer ( hitachi f - 2000 , tokyo , japan ) .
the values of [ ca2 +] i were calculated from the ratio r = f340 / f380 by the formula : [ ca2 +] i = kdb ( r - r min )/( r max - r ) , where kd is 225 nm , f is the fluorescence , and b is the ratio of the fluorescence of the free dye to that of the ca2 + - bound dye measured at 380 nm. r max and r min were determined in separate experiments by using dobutamine to equilibrate [ ca2 +] i with ambient [ ca2 +] ( r max ) , and the addition of 0.1 mmol / l mncl2 and 1 mmol / l egta ( r min ) .
background autofluorescence was measured in unloaded cells and subtracted from all experimental measurements .
2.6 .
small interfering rna ( sirna ) duplexed rna oligonucleotides for rat ppardelta ( stealth rnai ) were synthesized by invitrogen using our previous method [ 24 ] .
the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were transfected with 40 pmol of ppardelta - specific sirna ( sirna - ppardelta ) or scramble sirna using lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocols .
these cardiomyocytes were subjected to experimental conditions as described above for 48 hours posttransfection .
the sequences of the sirna - ppardelta are uugcagauccgaucgcacuucucgu ( sense strand ) and acgagaagugcgaucggaucugcaa ( antisense strand ) as described previously [ 24 ] .
2.7 .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using an anova and the newman - keuls post - hoc analysis .
statistical significance was set as p < 0.05 .
the results were expressed as mean +/ - sem .
3. results 3.1 .
increase of ppardelta expression by dobutamine in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with dobutamine to identify the changes in ppardelta expression .
treatment with dobutamine at 0.1 mumol / l increased ppardelta protein expression level in a time - dependent manner ( figure 1 ( b )) and the levels in these cells were increased to maximum at 4 hours later of drug treatment .
dobutamine was then incubated for 4 h at various concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 mumol / l. the ppardelta protein expression levels in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were increased by dobutamine in a concentration - dependent manner ( figure 1 ( a )) .
3.2 .
effects of atenolol and butoxamine on dobutamine - induced actions in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to determine the receptor involved in dobutamine - induced the expressions of ppardelta and the phosphorylation of ctni , we treated the cells with atenolol at a concentration sufficient to block the beta1 - adrenoceptor [ 19 , 20 ] and butoxamine to block the beta2 - adrenoceptor [ 21 ] .
the increases in ppardelta expression and ctni phosphorylation due to dobutamine were inhibited by 10 mumol / l of atenolol ( figures 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b )) ; however , butoxamine failed to modify the actions of dobutamine ( figures 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b )) .
3.3 .
effect of protein kinase a inhibitor on dobutamine - induced actions in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes the beta1 - adrenoceptor is known to couple to adenylyl cyclase [ 2 - 6 ] .
an increase of cyclic amp causes protein kinase a ( pka ) activation which results in higher levels of ppardelta protein expression [ 25 , 26 ] .
thus , we used the specific inhibitor of protein kinase a ( pkai ) to verify the roles of pka in changes of ppardelta expressions .
the dobutamine - induced increases of ppardelta expression were reduced by treatment with 10 mumol / l of pkai ( figure 2 ( c )) .
3.4 .
effects of intracellular calcium levels on dobutamine - induced actions in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes the fluorescent probe , fura2 - am is used to detect the intracellular calcium concentration in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes .
dobutamine increased the intracellular calcium levels from 155.4 + 11.4 nmol / l to 484.7 + 22.4 nmol / l ( n = 8 ) at 0.1 mumol / l and increased in a concentration - dependent manner .
pretreatment of the cells with the calcium chelator bapta - am ( bapta ) at an effective concentration ( 25 mumol / l ) [ 27 ] reduced the actions of dobutamine on the increases of ppardelta expression and ctni phosphorylation ( figures 2 ( d ) and 2 ( e )) .
3.5 .
calcium - related pathway as the possible signal for dobutamine - induced actions in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes cyclosporine a ( csa , a calcineurin inhibitor ) and kn93 ( a calcium / calmodulin kinase inhibitor ) were used to investigate whether dobutamine - induced ppardelta expression is mediated through the activation of calcium - related pathway [ 22 ] .
the dobutamine - induced increases in ppardelta expression and ctni phosphorylation were markedly inhibited by either 1 mumol / l of csa or 1 mumol / l of kn93 ( figures 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b )) .
3.6 .
effects of sirna - ppardelta on dobutamine - induced actions in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were transfected with either sirna targeted to ppardelta or a scramble control for 48 hours , as described previously [ 24 ] .
after treatment with dobutamine , ppardelta expression was markedly reduced in the cardiomyocytes that were transfected with the sirna targeted to ppardelta ( figure 4 ( a )) .
the cells transfected the sirna - scramble did not affect dobutamine - induced increase of ppardelta expression ( figure 4 ( a )) .
moreover , dobutamine - induced tni phosphorylation was also reduced in cells treated with sirna - ppardelta but remained unchanged in the cells transfected with sirna - scramble ( figure 4 ( b )) .
4. discussion in the present study , treatment with dobutamine in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes caused a concentration - dependent increase in both ppardelta protein expression and ctni phosphorylation .
these increases induced by dobutamine were blocked by pretreatment with atenolol , pkai , kn93 , csa , or bapta .
moreover , the dobutamine - induced increases in ppardelta protein expression and ctni phosphorylation were markedly reduced in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes that were transfected with sirna targeted to ppardelta .
thus , the mediation of ppardelta in dobutamine - induced cardiac action can be considered .
it has been reported that ppardelta is involved in excitation - transcription coupling [ 28 ] and that calcineurin - mediated skeletal muscle reprogramming induces the expression of several transcriptional regulators , including ppardelta [ 29 ] .
taken together , we suggest that the increase in ppardelta expression by dobutamine is mainly induced by an activation of the beta1 - adrenoceptor , which results in an increase of intracellular camp and calcium .
this leads to an increase in heart contractility .
regulation of ppardelta expression in cardiac muscles through the intracellular ca2 + signaling pathway has been established [ 22 , 30 , 31 ] .
we show that treatment with bapta suppressed dobutamine - induced ppardelta protein expression .
we also show that the inhibition of pka reduced dobutamine - induced expression of ppardelta .
this result is consistent with the finding that the activation of pka induces intracellular calcium release [ 32 ] .
thus , dobutamine exerts its effects on ppardelta expression in a calcium - dependent manner via the activation of pka in cardiac cells .
it has been demonstrated that ctni phosphorylation most likely occurs due to an enhanced off rate during ca2 + exchange with the cardiac troponin calcium binding site , leading to an acceleration of relaxation and an increase in cardiac output [ 31 , 33 - 36 ] .
similarly , we found that ctni phosphorylation is elevated in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes after treatment with dobutamine .
we also observed that pretreatment with calcium chelater ( bapta ) decreased the levels of ctni phosphorylation in dobutamine - treated cardiomyocytes .
therefore , we suggest that the increase in intracellular calcium is responsible for the increase of ctni phosphorylation by dobutamine .
this explanation is consistent with previously published reports [ 31 , 33 - 36 ] .
the role of ppardelta in the phosphorylation of ctni in cardiomyocytes remains unclear .
thus , we applied ppardelta - targeted sirna to better characterize this possible relationship .
in this study , a 48 hours transfection of sirna - ppardelta in cardiomyocytes suppressed dobutamine - induced ctni phosphorylation .
thus , it is suggested that ppardelta is involved in dobutamine - induced ctni phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes .
in conclusion , we demonstrated that treatment with dobutamine in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes can increase ppardelta expression by an activation of the beta1 - adrenoceptor through camp to activate pka and increase intracellular calcium levels .
this increase may induce calmodulin and calcineurin activation which could result in higher ppardelta protein expression .
taken together , increases in ppardelta protein expression and ctni phosphorylation are responsible for dobutamine - induced cardiac action , suggesting a new mechanism for dobutamine - induced cardiac contraction .

figure 4 effects of ppardelta - targeted sirna on dobutamine - induced actions in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes .
the neonatal rat cardiomyocytes transfected with sirna - targeted to ppardelta or sirna - scramble ( sirna - control ) were incubated with 1 mumol / l dobutamine .
all cells were then harvested to measure ppardelta expression ( a ) or ctni phosphorylation ( b ) using western blotting analysis .
all values are expressed as mean +/ - sem ( n = 6 per group ) .
* p < 0.05 as compared with the vehicle - treated control and # p < 0.05 as compared with the dobutamine - treated cells transfected with the scramble sirna ( sirna - control ) .

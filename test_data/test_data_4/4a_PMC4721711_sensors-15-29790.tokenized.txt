in order to improve the precision of glonass orbits , this paper presents a method to connect the data segments of a single station - satellite pair to increase the observation continuity and , consequently , the strength of the precise orbit determination ( pod ) solution .
in this method , for each glonass station - satellite pair , the wide - lane ambiguities derived from the melbourne - wubbena combination are statistically tested and corrected for phase integer offsets and then the same is carried out for the narrow - lane ambiguities calculated from the pod solution .
an experimental validation was carried out using one - month gnss data of a global network with 175 igs stations .
the result shows that , on average , 27.1 % of the glonass station - satellite pairs with multiple data segments could be connected to a single long observation arc and , thus , only one ambiguity parameter was estimated .
using the connected data , the glonass orbit overlapping rms at the day boundaries could be reduced by 19.2 % in ideal cases with an averaged reduction of about 6.3 % .
glonass data connection precise orbit determination orbit precision 1 .
introduction glonass is currently another global navigation satellite system ( gnss ) with full operational capability other than gps .
the precise orbit determination ( pod ) is the prerequisite for numerous gnss applications with the demand of high accuracy .
since 1998 , the glonass precise orbit products were developed within the international glonass experiment ( igex ) [ 1 ]. from 2001 , the international gnss service ( igs ) [ 2 ] established the international glonass service pilot project ( iglos - pp ) [ 3 ]. through these efforts pod of the glonass constellation has been gradually improved [ 4,5,6,7 ] and its orbit precision currently reaches the centimeter level .
however , it is still markedly worse than that of gps in terms of the orbit agreement among different igs analysis centers and over - day boundaries [ 8,9,10 ] .
one of the major reasons is that the gps solution is very much strengthened by its successful ambiguity resolution even over baselines up to several thousand kilometers [ 11,12,13,14 ] .
unlike gps , which adopts code division multiple access ( cdma ) , the present glonass uses frequency division multiple access ( fdma ) to distinguish the signals from individual satellites [ 15 ] .
it introduces different hardware biases to each receiving channel , thus makes its ambiguity resolution rather difficult , especially for long baselines .
in order to increase the strength of the glonass solution , several studies on the glonass ambiguity resolution have been carried out .
most of the developed mathematical and stochastical modeling methodologies and specific ambiguity resolution strategies are systematically summarized and investigated by wang et al .
[ 16 ] .
it is well known that through the calibration of carrier - phase inter - frequency biases at the glonass receiver - end , the ambiguity resolution for baselines of several hundred kilometers can be achieved [ 17 ] .
in the igs data processing at code ( center for orbit determination in europe ) , for baselines shorter than 200 km , the glonass ambiguity resolution is enabled for all satellites , whereas for longer baselines only ambiguities of the same frequency channels are considered in order to improve the orbit quality [ 18 ] .
however , most of the igs analysis centers have not yet implemented the glonass ambiguity resolution most likely due to its complexity and limited benefit .
it is quite meaningful to further improve the accuracy of glonass orbit for high - precision gnss applications .
a novel method , i.e. , data connection rather than ambiguity resolution , is introduced and investigated in this contribution .
as demonstrated in [ 19 ] , when using carrier ranges [ 20 ] generated with the undifferenced integer ambiguities in precise point positioning ( ppp ) [ 21,22 ] for single stations , the data continuity for gps satellites is increased and the averaged rms of the overlapping orbits is reduced .
it is also demonstrated that most observation segments , even that from separated satellite passes with a data gap of hours , can be connected .
inspired by this fact , we present a method for data connection to improve glonass orbit quality by using the connected data .
since currently the glonass ppp ambiguity resolution is rather difficult to be realized on a global scale , instead of using the carrier - range method , the data are connected by checking the consistency of the wide - lane and narrow - lane ambiguities of different observation segments .
after the successful data connection , glonass orbit quality is expected to be improved .
in this contribution , we try to make a thorough performance assessment of the data connection method and analyze possible benefits for glonass orbit determination .
the data connection method is presented in the next section .
then experimental validation is described with the details of the network , data set and processing strategy .
the performance of the data connection and the improvement on glonass orbits in terms of overlapping rms are presented and investigated in subsequent sections , followed by conclusions and suggestions .
2. data connection method in general , we assume that undifferenced ionosphere - free phase ( lc ) and range ( pc ) observations are used in the data processing , and the observation equations are : ( 1 ) lc = f12f12 - f22l1 - f22f12 - f22l2 = rho + dtrs + lambda1bcpc = f12f12 - f22p1 - f22f12 - f22p2 = rho + dtrs where l1 , l2 , p1 , and p2 are phase and range observations of the two frequencies f1 and f2 in the unit of length , respectively .
dtrs is the receiver clock bias minus satellite clock bias .
rho is the non - dispersive delay including the geometric distance , the tropospheric delay , and any other delay which affects the observations identically , with the correction of the phase center [ 23 ] , the phase windup effect [ 24 ] , and the satellite - dependent differential code biases ( dcb ) [ 25 ] .
bc is the lc ambiguity .
multipath effect , hardware delay , and noise are not included in the equation for clarity .
for the ambiguity resolution , ambiguity bc is usually expressed by wide - lane ( wl ) and narrow - lane ( nl ) ambiguities [ 12 ] as : ( 2 ) bc = f1f2f12 - f22bw + f1f1 + f2bn usually , wl ambiguities are fixed based on the melbourne - wubbena ( mw ) combination [ 26,27 ] , whereas nl ambiguities are derived based on the fixed wl and the estimated ionosphere - free ambiguities and fixed accordingly .
we follow the procedure of the ambiguity resolution to connect the wl ambiguities first , and then the nl ambiguities .
without loss of generality , we assume that there are n observation segments for a station - satellite pair and their wl ambiguities and the corresponding standard deviations computed using the mw combination are [ bwi,sigmawi ] i = 1,2 ,... , n. for the observation segments j and k , we can get the difference and its standard deviation as : ( 3 ) bwjk = bwj - bwksigmawjk = sigmawj2 + sigmawk2 if there is a unique integer value iw and it satisfies : ( 4 ) iw - 3sigmawjk < bwjk < iw + 3sigmawjk then wl of the two segments can be connected by applying the phase integer offset of iw. obviously , the standard error of the difference , i.e. , sigmawjk must be small enough in order to obtain a unique phase integer offset .
a more sophisticated way to make the decision whether the two wl ambiguities can be connected is to use the following probability function [ 12 ] : ( 5 ) p = 1 - sumn = 1infinity [ erfc ( n - ( bwjk - i ) 2sigmawjk ) - erfc ( n +( bwjk - i ) 2sigmawjk )] ( 6 ) erfc ( x )= 2piintegralxinfinitye - t2dt where i is the integer candidate for bwjk to be tested .
taking the confidence level alpha of data connection as 0.1 % , if p is bigger than 1 - alpha , the wl ambiguities of the two segments can be connected confidently with the phase integer offset iw = i , otherwise they cannot be connected .
after the wl ambiguities are connected with an phase integer offset iw , i.e. , bwj = bwk + iw , we can get the corresponding nl ambiguity with the connected wl ambiguities and the ionosphere - free ambiguities estimated from the adjustment as : ( 7 ) bnk = f1 + f2f1bck - f2f1 - f2bwk ( 8 ) bnj = f1 + f2f1bcj - f2f1 - f2 ( bwk + iw ) similar to the wide - lane , their difference and the corresponding standard deviation are : ( 9 ) bnjk = bnj - bnksigmanjk = f1 + f2f2sigmacj2 + sigmack2 - 2sigmacjk it should be pointed out that the correlation term in equation ( 9 ) could not be ignored , as the std of the two undifferenced ambiguities from the adjustment are usually rather large .
moreover , for the sake of computational efficiency , the covariance of ambiguities is not available , in this case , a default value of 0.05 cycles can be applied at least for processing data of long segments from our expertise in the previous studies on ambiguity resolution [ 28 ] as well as in this research .
similar to the wl connection , we can determine whether the two nl ambiguities can be connected according to the probability equation ( 5 ) .
based on the approximation , if the fractional parts of the two nl ambiguities are close to each other , with the difference of 0.15 cycles , the two nl ambiguities can be connected .
let the corresponding phase integer offset be in , we have bnj = bnk + in. it is worth mentioning that two observation segments of a station - satellite pair are regarded as connected , only when both the wl and nl ambiguities are connected. by considering that bw = b1 - b2 and bn = b1 , we can get the relationship between the l1 and l2 ambiguities of the two segments , respectively , as : ( 10 ) { b1k = bnkb2k = bnk - bwk { b1j = bnk + inb2j = bnk - bwk +( in - iw ) this can also be expressed by the phase integer offsets between the observation segments k and j in the l1 and l2 frequencies as n1 and n2 , with n1 = in , and n2 = in - iw. applying the phase integer offsets to the second segment , these two segments are connected and only the ambiguity at the data beginning is remaining .
performing this data connection procedure for all the observation segments of a station - satellite pair iteratively until no new segments can be connected any more .
after successful connection , the estimates of the connected segment can be updated for further processing .
it should be mentioned that the data connection method can be applied to glonass fdma signals , as well as to cdma signals adopted by the other constellations , as the connection is carried out for each station - satellite pair .
as to the implementation issue , the phase observations are corrected with the determined phase integer offsets and for each station a new rinex observation file is generated with a special flag indicating the corrected phase integer offsets. with such corrected observation files , the estimation processing is carried out in the same way as usual except that no ambiguity is estimated for the connected segments .
in practice , careful screening of the post - fit residuals should be implemented to confirm the correctness of the connection and to remove possible incorrect connections .
3. experimental validation in order to validate the connection method described above , an experiment was carried out for data connection in glonass pod .
we adopted combined orbit determination of gps and glonass on the observation level using globally well distributed igs stations with daily observations , as the combination with gps can improve the glonass satellite orbits [ 8 ] .
observations of 175 igs stations from doy 270 to 300 , 2013 were used .
figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of the tracking stations , where 32 gps - only stations are represented by red dots and the rest gps / glonass stations by blue triangles .
figure 1 geographical distribution of the 175 igs tracking stations used in the experiment , dots are for gps - only stations and triangles for gps / glonass stations .
the positioning and navigation data analyst ( panda ) [ 29,30 ] software was adapted and used for data connection and pod processing in this study .
in the combined gps / glonass processing , the inter - frequency bias ( ifb ) in a receiver was estimated as a constant for each glonass frequency .
observation segments shorter than 40 min were deleted .
ambiguity resolution for baselines shorter than 3500 km was carried out for gps using the method in [ 14 ] whereas no ambiguity resolution for glonass .
in the glonass data connection , no connection was undertaken if the distance between the ambiguity difference and its closest integer was larger than 0.15 cycles .
the pod solution was carried out in accordance with the routine processing at the gfz ( german research center for geosciences ) igs analysis center .
the other important options of processing strategy about observation model and force model in the experiment are listed in table 1 .

afterwards , glonass orbits before and after the data connection were compared with the igs final orbits .
then , the overlapping rms of the solution on the day boundaries was assessed to confirm the possible improvements of glonass orbit quality .
3.1 .
data connection ratio to assess the effectiveness of the data connection , we define an empirical connection ratio , i.e. , the number of glonass station - satellite pairs that are successfully connected to only one arc divided by the number of glonass station - satellite pairs that originally have various observation segments .
in the validation experiment , typically a station could track all the 24 glonass satellites on a daily basis , where the majority glonass satellites had more than one observation segments .
taking the average for all the stations , there were 17 glonass satellites that had multiple observation segments in the daily observing duration .
the number was reduced to 12.4 on average after the proposed data connection , i.e. , 4.6 extra glonass satellites were connected to have only one observation arc .
specifically for the wl connection , there were 11.3 extra satellites that were connected to only one arc and the connection ratio was 66.5 % .
for the nl connection , there were 4.6 extra satellites connected to only one arc and the connection ratio was 27.1 % .
obviously , the nl is more difficult to be connected because it has a much shorter wavelength of about 11 cm compared with the wl of about 84 cm. on average , there were about 44 ambiguity parameters per station before the data connection and the number was reduced to 39 after the data connection .
for all the stations in the daily solution , the total number of glonass ambiguities was 6257 and it was reduced to 5546 after the data connection with a reduction percentage of 11.4 % .
the connection ratios of each different receiver type listed in table 2 were calculated and are shown in figure 2 for wl and nl ambiguities , respectively .
since the wl ambiguities are computed using the mw combination , it is only influenced by the measurement noises including carrier phase and code multipath .
therefore , the wl connection ratio among individual receiver types should be attributed mainly to the measurement quality of receiver types .
for the nl connection ratio , there was almost no significant difference among individual receiver types , and the connection ratio was rather low of about 26.2 % .
it is easy to understand that the nl connection is limited by the quality of the solution from which nl ambiguity is derived .
this also means that the estimation of the ionosphere - free ambiguity must be further improved in order to obtain a better connection result .

manufacturer receiver number javad 22 jps 12 leica 43 sept 5 tps 16 trimble 44 figure 2 wide - lane and narrow - lane connection ratio for different type of receivers .
the connection ratios for individual glonass satellites were also calculated and are shown in figure 3 for wl and nl ambiguities , respectively .
slight differences can be found among individual glonass satellites , which are more pronounced for wl connection than for nl connection .
for the wl connection , we attribute the differences to the measurement noises and the stability of individual satellite hardware delays , as no other factors seem plausible .
for the nl connection , the differences are rather small and could be caused by the different tracking geometry and inaccurate modeling .
it should be mentioned that the undifferenced ambiguities are affected by a combination of code and phase hardware delays in the satellite and the receiver [ 42 ] .
the possible temporal changes in the satellite or the receiver hardware delays can be one error source affecting the success of the data connection method .
for example , the long - term temporal variation in the receiver dcb is found to be linearly correlated with the ambient outdoor temperatures [ 43 ] .
the impact on the daily orbit solutions may also affect the data connection ratio .
figure 3 wide - lane and narrow - lane connection ratio for individual glonass satellites .
3.2 .
improvement on glonass satellite orbits in order to show the influence of the data connection , the glonass satellite orbits are compared before and after the data connection .
the individual glonass satellite orbit variation is computed every five minutes in each day and averaged in rms during the experiment period .
the result is shown in figure 4 .
the orbit variation is 7.5 mm on average for all the glonass satellites .
the magnitude of the orbit variation is considerable taking into account that the connection ratio is relatively low and the connection is carried out on a single station basis without strong constraints among different stations .
figure 4 glonass satellite orbit variation after the data connection .
we first compared the glonass satellite orbits before and after the data connection with the igs final glonass orbits .
after a seven - parameter helmert transformation for removing possible systematic differences , the median rms during the experimental period is shown in figure 5 .
the rms of all the glonass satellites was almost the same of 23.7 mm for the two solutions .
we can also see that for many glonass satellites , the rms got slightly larger of about 1 mm after the data connection .
there was no significant difference between the two solutions , i.e. , the orbits were not dramatically improved by the data connection method from the point of orbit differences with igs final products .
it may indicate that it is difficult using the igs final products to assess the possible orbit improvement of the data connection , although they are of high quality .
figure 5 comparison of glonass orbits before and after the data connection with igs final products .
for more realistic orbit quality assessment , the discontinuity at the day boundary is adopted as a measure in griffiths and ray [ 9 ] .
the overlapping orbit rms of the glonass satellites before and after the data connection were calculated and plotted in figure 6 .
since the overlapping rms involve orbits from two consecutive days , the inferred orbit precision for a single daily solution should be divided by 2 .
figure 6 overlapping orbit rms for the solution before ( green ) and after data connection ( blue ) .
usually , the median rms of all the satellites is selected as an indicator for the orbit quality because it can avoid the effect of bad satellites with very large rms [ 8 ] .
the median rms before the data connection was 60.0 mm and it was reduced to 56.2 mm by the data connection .
the overall improvement was about 6.3 % .
for individual satellites , the largest improvement was by 19.2 % while the smallest improvement was by 0.6 % .
thus , data connection can indeed increase the solution strength and improve the orbit quality , although the improvement is not as strong as that of ambiguity resolution which substantially improves the orbit quality for gps satellites .
for comparison , the overlapping orbit rms of all the gps satellites was improved by about 30.5 % after ambiguity resolution for the experiment period. from figure 6 , five satellites show slight degradation rather than improvement .
the possible correlations with the orbital plane , the satellite type , and launch time were checked but no obvious correlation was found , which should be further investigated .
nevertheless , data connection could improve the overall glonass orbit quality , before the glonass ambiguity resolution for long baselines up to several thousands of kilometers can be implemented reliably .
4. conclusions and suggestions since the reliable glonass ambiguity resolution over long baselines is not yet available , we developed a method for data connection to increase the strength of global network solutions .
the wl ambiguities of all segments are derived from the mw combination and their nl are calculated based on the connected wl and the estimated ambiguities in the adjustment .
the wl and nl ambiguities of each glonass station - satellite pair are statistically tested and corrected for phase integer offsets .
in this way , glonass station - satellite pairs with multiple data segments can be connected and even to a single observation arc , i.e. , only one ambiguity parameter is remaining .
since the number of ambiguities is reduced , the strength of the solution will be increased and consequently the orbit quality is improved with the connected data .
the connection method and its impact on satellite orbits were investigated through an experimental validation using a global network of igs ground tracing stations .
the effectiveness of the connection method was investigated for different receiver types and individual glonass satellites .
the statistics show that on average 27.1 % of the glonass station - satellite pairs with multiple data segments can be connected to a single observation arc .
the major restriction is in the nl connection most likely due to inaccurate modeling in the estimation .
the rms of overlapping orbits for the solutions with and without the data connection were computed and analyzed .
the median rms of the overlapping orbits for all the glonass satellites was reduced from 60.0 mm to 56.2 mm after the data connection , which corresponds to an averaged improvement of about 6.3 % over all satellites .
furthermore , the largest improvement was up to 19.2 % for a single satellite .
as the glonass ambiguity resolution is not reliably available , the data connection provides an alternative way to improve the orbit quality , although it is not as significant as the ambiguity resolution for gps .
finally , from the results of one - month pod experiment , we could conclude that the quality of glonass satellites orbits could be slightly improved by the data connection method .
the improvement could be increased by more accurate modeling in the adjustment , like the solar radiation pressure model .
the recent developments of glonass orbit modeling , e.g. , by improving the empirical ecom model [ 44 ] or applying the adjustable box - wing model [ 45 ] , should be implemented and investigated in the future .
furthermore , the connection can still be utilized to improve the solution even if the reliable glonass ambiguity resolution is implemented .

bioenergetic abnormalities and metabolic dysfunction occur in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) patients and genetic mouse models .
however , whether metabolic dysfunction occurs early in als pathophysiology linked to different als genes remains unclear .
here , we investigated amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) activation , which is a key enzyme induced by energy depletion and metabolic stress , in neuronal cells and mouse models expressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 ( sod1 ) or tar dna binding protein 43 ( tdp - 43 ) linked to als .
ampk phosphorylation was sharply increased in spinal cords of transgenic sod1g93a mice at disease onset and accumulated in cytoplasmic granules in motor neurons , but not in pre - symptomatic mice .
ampk phosphorylation also occurred in peripheral tissues , liver and kidney , in sod1g93a mice at disease onset , demonstrating that ampk activation occurs late and is not restricted to motor neurons .
conversely , ampk activity was drastically diminished in spinal cords and brains of presymptomatic and symptomatic transgenic tdp - 43a315t mice and motor neuronal cells expressing different tdp - 43 mutants .
we show that mutant tdp - 43 induction of the ampk phosphatase , protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ) , is associated with ampk inactivation in these als models .
furthermore , pp2a inhibition by okadaic acid reversed ampk inactivation by mutant tdp - 43 in neuronal cells .
our results suggest that mutant sod1 and tdp - 43 exert contrasting effects on ampk activation which may reflect key differences in energy metabolism and neurodegeneration in spinal cords of sod1g93a and tdp - 43a315t mice .
while ampk activation in motor neurons correlates with progression in mutant sod1 - mediated disease , ampk inactivation mediated by pp2a is associated with mutant tdp - 43 - linked als .

introduction amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) is a progressive and fatal paralysing disorder caused by selective degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
the reason for the selective vulnerability of motor neurons to mutations in ubiquitously expressed proteins , such as superoxide dismutase 1 ( sod1 ) and tar dna - binding protein - 43 ( tdp 43 ) , remains unclear [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
factors accounting for this selective neuronal susceptibility in als may include the unusual high synthetic , energetic and transport demands of large projection motor neurons [ 3 ] .
this leads to high atp consumption and mitochondrial metabolism relative to other cells , rendering these neurons susceptible to energetic defects [ 4 ] .
thus , defects in mitochondrial function that occur in als patients and mouse models [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] will affect atp production , impairing na +/ k + - atpase function and maintenance of resting membrane potential in motor neurons [ 7 ] .
there is considerable evidence for hypermetabolism and impaired energy homeostasis in als patients and genetic mouse models .
als patients show accelerated loss of muscle mass and fat during disease progression [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and elevated energy expenditure at rest [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
in mutant sod1g86r and sod1g93a mice , glucose , atp and fat metabolism are increased in spinal cord and brain at presymptomatic disease , indicative of energy hypermetabolism [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
in symptomatic sod1g93a mice , there is increased metabolic acidosis , lipolysis and glycogen accumulation in the cns [ 14 ] .
furthermore , a high - fat diet significantly delayed disease onset and increased lifespan in mutant sod1 mice [ 12 ] , while caloric restriction accelerated disease course [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
there is also evidence for metabolic dysfunction in als mediated by abnormal tdp - 43 .
postnatal depletion of tdp - 43 in mice leads to dramatic loss of body fat followed by rapid death and tbc1d1 expression , a gene that mediates leanness and linked to obesity , is downregulated in the absence of tdp - 43 [ 17 ] .
in tdp - 43a315t mice , there is progressive weight gain , fat deposition , impaired glucose uptake and increased tbc1d1 expression in presymptomatic mice [ 18 ] .
together , this suggests that tdp - 43 expression level is an important regulator of glucose and energy metabolism , while more importantly , mutant tdp - 43 leads to metabolic dysfunction in an opposing manner to mutant sod1 .
here , we sought to correlate these well established findings of defective energy metabolism in mutant sod1 and tdp - 43 mice with amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) activation status .
ampk is a widely expressed master metabolic and stress sensor which detects mismatches in cell energy supply and demand [ 19 ] .
it is activated by high amp : atp ratio and metabolic stresses that inhibit atp production or stimulate atp consumption [ 19 ] .
ampk is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of alpha catalytic and regulatory beta and gamma subunits .
binding of amp to the gamma subunit stimulates alpha subunit phosphorylation at the active site threonine - 172 by two known upstream ampk kinases , liver kinase b1 ( lkb1 ) and ca2 +/ calmodulin - dependent protein kinase kinase ( camkk ) as reviewed [ 19 ] .
ampk inactivation by dephosphorylation has been linked to protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ) [ 20 ] , pp2c [ 21 ] , pp1 [ 22 ] and recently ppm1e [ 23 ] .
activation of ampk replenishes cellular atp levels by promoting increased fatty acid oxidation , glucose uptake and autophagy , while reducing protein translation , glycogen and cholesterol synthesis .
since ampk is a master regulator of energy metabolism and stress induced pathways , it is likely to be engaged in energetic defects in motor neurons in als .
we therefore examined ampk activation in sod1g93a and tdp - 43a315t mice and neuronal cells expressing different als - linked sod1 or tdp - 43 mutants .
here , we show that ampk activation is increased in spinal cords of sod1g93a mice consistent with energy hypermetabolism , while ampk activation is severely reduced in cns tissues of tdp - 43a315t mice , in accordance with weight gain and fat accumulation characteristic of this model .
we also uncover a novel regulation of ampk activation by mutant tdp - 43 via pp2a .

results ampk activation is increased in spinal cords of symptomatic mutant sod1 mice we first determined ampk activation status in sod1g93a mice at presymptomatic ( p60 ) and symptomatic ( p90 ) ages .
sod1g93a mice appear normal at p60 and develop hindlimb muscle weakness and wasting at p90 .
ampk activation by phosphorylation of alpha subunit threonine - 172 was assessed by immunoblotting for phospho ( pampk ) and total ampk levels in tissues of sod1g93a mice and wt littermates .
western blot analysis showed pampk and ampk bands at 62 kda as expected ( fig. 1 ) .
ampk activation , determined by pampk / ampk ratio , was similar in spinal cords of p60 mice of both genotypes ( fig. 1a,b ) .
however , ampk activation in spinal cords of sod1g93a mice was 300 % greater than in spinal cords of wt mice at p90 ( fig. 1b , p < 0.05 ) .
there was no change in ampk activation level in brains of p60 and p90 sod1g93a mice , however ( fig. 1c,d ) .

data represent mean +/ - sem , n = 4 - 5 mice per group , * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 compared to wt mice using unpaired t - test .
to determine whether increased ampk activation is selective to spinal cord , we next examined pampk / ampk ratio in non - affected tissues such as liver and kidney .
ampk activation was elevated by 60 % and 80 % in liver of sod1g93a mice at p60 and p90 , respectively , which was statistically significant at p90 ( fig. 1e,f , p < 0.05 ) .
ampk activation was also significantly increased by 80 % in kidney of sod1g93a mice at p60 ( fig. 1g,h , p < 0.01 ) , while unchanged at p90 .
thus , ampk activation occurs at symptom onset in spinal cords of sod1g93a mice and in peripheral tissues , suggesting that ampk signalling and therefore energy depletion is a late event in pathogenesis and not restricted to degenerating neurons in this mouse model of als .
ampk activation is reduced in spinal cords and brains of mutant tdp - 43 mice ampk activation was then examined in tdp - 43a315t mice at presymptomatic ( p60 ) and symptomatic ( p90 ) stages .
tdp - 43a315t mice appear healthy at p60 and develop an abnormal swimming gait at p90 without gross muscle wasting .
in contrast to sod1g93a mice , ampk activation was drastically decreased by 60 % at p60 ( p < 0.05 ) and 30 % at p90 in spinal cords of tdp - 43a315t mice ( fig. 2a,b ) .
in brain , pampk / ampk ratios were significantly diminished by 80 % at p60 ( p < 0.001 ) and 60 % at p90 ( p < 0.05 ) in tdp - 43a315t mice ( fig. 2e,f ) .
ampk activation was not studied in liver and kidney , which do not express the tdp - 43a315t transgene in our hands and others [ 32 ] .
hence , mutant tdp - 43 leads to reduced activation of ampk in spinal cord and brain which was more severe in the latter tissue , consistent with pronounced cortical pathology in these mice [ 32 ] .

we next screened expression level of phosphatases that could be responsible for dephosphorylation of ampk in tdp - 43a315t mice .
we examined four candidate ampk phosphatases : protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ) , pp2c , pp1 and ppm1e .
the levels of pp2c , pp1 and ppm1e were similar in spinal cords of presymptomatic and symptomatic tdp - 43a315t mice compared to wt ( fig. 2c ) .
however , levels of pp2a were significantly increased by 120 % in spinal cords of tdp - 43a315t mice at p60 ( p < 0.05 ) , positively correlating with ampk inactivation ( fig. 2c,d ) .
this suggests that pp2a is the likely phosphatase responsible for ampk inactivation in tdp - 43a315t mice and this phosphatase remained the focus of this study .
we also assessed pp2a expression in sod1g93a mice , showing that pp2a levels were significantly diminished by 30 % in spinal cords of mice at p90 ( p < 0.05 ) , showing an inverse correlation with ampk activation ( fig. 1a,i ) .
this strengthens the evidence that pp2a is modulating ampk activation in the cns of mutant sod1 and tdp - 43 mice .
activated ampk distribution in spinal motor neurons of normal mice and als mouse models the subcellular distribution of ampk was examined in spinal cord sections of mice at p90 using immunohistochemistry .
in wt mice , there were small pampk - positive punctae in the cytoplasm of motor neurons , identified by their size , ventral horn location and neun immunoreactivity ( fig. 3 , arrowheads ) .
in sod1g93a mice , there was increased pampk immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of motor neurons ( fig. 3a ) , consistent with western blotting findings ( fig. 1a,b ) .
increased pampk was restricted to motor neurons and was not observed in neun - negative hoechst - positive cells .
we quantified the percentage of motor neurons with cytoplasmic pampk granules , showing that almost all motor neurons in wt and sod1g93a mice contained pampk punctae , consistent with the ubiquitous expression of ampk ( fig. 3b ) .
however , the number of pampk granules was doubled in motor neurons of sod1g93a mice compared to wt mice ( p < 0.05 ) , indicative of increased ampk activation ( fig. 3c ) .

a , in wt mice , pampk is localised to cytoplasmic punctae ( arrowhead ) in motor neurons identified by neun .
pampk immunoreactive granules accumulate in the cytoplasm ( arrowheads ) of motor neurons in transgenic sod1g93a mice .
b , quantification of motor neurons ( mns ) containing pampk granules and c , pampk granules per motor neuron in wt and sod1g93a mice .
d , in transgenic tdp - 43a315t mice , cytoplasmic pampk immunoreactivity is reduced in motor neurons .
e , quantification of motor neurons ( mns ) containing pampk granules and f , pampk granules per motor neuron in wt and sod1g93a mice .
data represent mean +/ - sem , n = 3 mice per group , *** p < 0.001 compared to wt mice using unpaired t - test .
in tdp - 43a315t mice , pampk immunoreactive staining in motor neurons was less than in wt mice ( fig. 3d ) , again concordant with western results ( fig. 2a,b ) .
the number of motor neurons containing pampk granules was reduced by 50 % in tdp - 43a315t mice ( fig. 3e , p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , there was severe depletion of pampk granules by 80 % in motor neurons of mutant tdp - 43 mice ( fig. 3f , p < 0.05 ) , consistent with ampk inactivation in spinal cords of these mice .
thus , activated ampk is predominantly found in motor neurons and localised to cytoplasmic granules in the spinal cord and abnormally expressed in mutant sod1 and tdp - 43 mouse models of als .
aicar stimulates activation of ampk in nsc - 34 cells we next studied whether similar changes in ampk activation occur in motor neuronal nsc - 34 cells expressing different als - linked sod1 and tdp - 43 mutations .
the physiological activation response to the ampk agonist aicar was first established in nsc - 34 cells .
treatment of nsc - 34 cells with aicar for 2 hr resulted in dose - dependent phosphorylation of ampk with maximal stimulation at 2 mm concentration ( fig. 4a ) .
immunocytochemical analysis of untreated nsc - 34 cells revealed that pampk was primarily and diffusely localised to the cytoplasm ( fig. 4b ) .
there was a dose - dependent increase in cytoplasmic pampk immunoreactivity with aicar treatment .
aicar treatment did not adversely affect nsc - 34 cell viability ( fig. 4c ) .
thus , activated ampk is mainly cytoplasmic in nsc - 34 cells and motor neurons in spinal cord .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0090449.g004 figure 4 aicar stimulates activation of ampk in nsc - 34 cells .

cells treated with aicar reveal dose - dependent and increased cytoplasmic pampk immunoreactivity .
c , survival analysis of cells treated with 0 - 2 mm aicar for 2 hr. data represent mean +/ - sem , n = 3 experiments .
none of the aicar treatment groups were significantly different to untreated controls using one - way anova with tukey 's post - hoc test .
ampk activation in nsc - 34 cells expressing sod1 mutants ampk activation in nsc - 34 cells stably transfected with dismutase active ( g37r , g93a ) or inactive ( a4v , g85r ) human sod1 mutants was compared to nsc - 34 cells expressing wt human sod1 .
although transient transfection with these mutants results in protein aggregates , er stress and cell death [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , these features were not found in these stable cells , which may represent a pre - symptomatic als state i.e. sod1g93a mice at p60 .
in support of this , western blot analysis showed similar levels of ampk activation in cells expressing normal or mutant sod1 , although there was a non - significant trend for diminished ampk activation ( fig. 5a,b ) .
likewise , pp2a levels were similar in cells expressing wt or mutant sod1 ( fig. 5c ) .
these western blot findings were correlated with immunocytochemical analysis , showing that pampk is mainly cytoplasmic in nsc - 34 cells expressing normal or mutant sod1 ( fig. 5d ) .
therefore , ampk activation does not occur in presymptomatic neuronal cells or mouse models expressing mutant sod1 .

ampk activation is reduced by mutant tdp - 43 in nsc - 34 cells by a pp2a - dependent mechanism next , ampk activation in nsc - 34 cells stably expressing wt or mutant ( d169g , a315t , q331k and m337v ) tdp - 43 was analysed .
there was greater cytoplasmic accumulation of mutant than wt tdp - 43 in these cells ( fig. 6d ) .
pampk / ampk ratio measured by western blot was significantly reduced in cells expressing different tdp - 43 mutants ( fig. 6a,b ) .
activated ampk level was 50 % and 70 % less in cells expressing q331k and m337v , respectively , than in cells expressing wt tdp - 43 ( fig. 6b , p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 ) .
there was a corresponding increase in the level of pp2a by 40 % and 120 % in q331k and m337v expressing cells , respectively ( fig. 6c ) .
in nsc - 34 cells expressing wt tdp - 43 , pampk was predominantly located in cytoplasmic granules ( fig. 6d ) .
however , in cells expressing mutant tdp - 43 , pampk immunoreactivity was reduced , consistent with immunoblots and immunohistochemical findings from spinal cords of transgenic tdp - 43a315t mice .

a , pp2a immunoblot analysis and c , quantification of pp2a level from immunoblots .
d , immunocytochemical analysis of cells expressing wt tdp - 43 shows cytoplasmic pampk granules which are reduced in mutant tdp - 43 expressing cells .
e , immunoblot analysis of pampk and total ampk levels in tdp - 43 stable cells treated with 0 - 1 mum okadaic acid ( oa ) for 30 min .
to determine whether mutant tdp - 43 is driving ampk inactivation by pp2a , we treated nsc - 34 cells expressing wt or mutant tdp - 43 with the selective pp2a inhibitor okadaic acid ( oa ) .
oa treatment at 1 mum led to increased ampk activation in cells expressing wt , q331k or m337v tdp - 43 , which was more pronounced for mutant tdp - 43 ( fig. 6e ) .
hence , mutant tdp - 43 reduction of ampk activation occurs by a pp2a - dependent mechanism .
discussion we demonstrate several novel findings in this study .
firstly , ampk activation occurs only at disease onset in spinal cords of mutant sod1 mice , but is not restricted to this tissue , occurring also in non - affected liver and kidney .
secondly , ampk activation is severely diminished in spinal cords and brains of mice and motor neuronal cells expressing mutant tdp - 43 .
thirdly , mutant tdp - 43 inhibition of ampk phosphorylation is mediated by pp2a .
lastly , activated ampk is predominantly localised to small cytoplasmic granules of motor neurons in adult spinal cord .
elevated ampk activation in spinal cords of symptomatic sod1g93a mice correlates well with key indices of energy hypermetabolism reported in this model , including increased glucose and atp consumption [ 13 ] , lactate metabolism [ 2 ] , lipolysis [ 12 ] and metabolic acidosis [ 14 ] .
the presence of activated ampk in both cns and peripheral tissues in mutant sod1 mice at symptom onset argues against a role for ampk signalling in disease initiation , although it may be a determinant of disease progression .
in support of this , treatment of sod1g93a mice with metformin , which activates ampk , conferred no significant effect on disease onset , but hastened death in female mice only [ 27 ] .
consistent with our findings , increased ampk activation in spinal cords of p90 mutant sod1 mice , but not juvenile p40 mice , was recently reported [ 28 ] .
here , we resolved the time course of ampk phosphorylation , showing activation at p90 , but not at p60 , in these mice .
however , this study also found that ampk - mediated transcription of its downstream target genes ( e.g. pcg - 1alpha , gpx1 and sod2 ) was unaltered in spinal cords of sod1g93a mice [ 28 ] and thus , the role of elevated ampk signalling in mutant sod1 mice remains unclear .
we suggest that increased ampk activation in spinal cords of sod1g93a mice reflects energy depletion in motor neurons well after they start degenerating and is a late event in als pathogenesis .
this might be brought about by reactivity to muscle wasting and weight loss at symptom onset [ 29 ] .
pharmacological activation of ampk by aicar or its inhibition by compound c [ 19 ] is therefore unlikely to significantly modify disease in mutant sod1 mice or provide an effective therapeutic benefit in als .
in contrast to increased ampk activation in sod1g93a mice , its activity was drastically diminished in mice and neuronal cells expressing tdp - 43 mutants .
while this was an unexpected finding , it can be rationalised in the case of tdp - 43a315t mice .
unlike sod1g93a mice , tdp - 43a315t mice develop mild motor neuron loss in the spinal cord and do not progressively lose muscle mass or succumb to als - like symptoms , but rather die from bowel obstruction caused by gut innervation defects [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
in contrast , tdp - 43a315t mice have pronounced neuronal loss and ubiquitin pathology in cortex , which would be consistent with greater depletion of ampk activation in brain , compared to spinal cord in this model [ 32 ] .
most recently , it was shown that tdp - 43a315t mice develop progressive weight gain , increased body fat and adipocyte hypertrophy [ 18 ] , which is consistent with a state of energy surplus , and therefore ampk inactivation as shown here .
interestingly , analysis of neuronal cells expressing different tdp - 43 mutants also revealed reduced ampk activation similar to mice .
expression of pp2a , but not other reported ampk phosphatases , was induced by mutant tdp - 43 and treatment with the pp2a inhibitor okadaic acid reversed this effect in cell culture .
in another study , pp2a inhibition by okadaic acid or pp2ac knockdown both restored ampk phosphorylation in cells exposed to heat shock , supporting that ampk inactivation is driven by pp2a under cell stress [ 33 ] .
we therefore conclude that pp2a mediates ampk inactivation observed in cell and mouse models expressing mutant tdp - 43 .
there is increasing evidence that tdp - 43 plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] and stress - inducible kinases such as c - jun n - terminal kinase and extracellular - signal - regulated kinase [ 34 ] and modulation of pp2a may therefore provide an important link coupling pathogenic tdp - 43 to ampk activity .
in conclusion , our results demonstrate contrasting effects of mutant sod1 and tdp - 43 on ampk activation in mouse models of als .
this is likely to reflect key differences in neurodegeneration , resulting muscle wasting and energy metabolism characteristic of these models .
in sod1g93a mice characterised primarily by spinal motor neuron loss , muscle atrophy and weight loss , ampk activation is increased which is indicative of energy hypermetabolism .
in tdp - 43a315t mice with mainly cortical motor neuron pathology and minimal spinal motor neuron loss without muscle wasting , ampk activation is reduced , in keeping with weight gain and fat deposition in this model .
furthermore , we uncover a novel regulation of ampk activation mediated by pp2a by mutant tdp - 43 in vitro and in vivo .
modulation of pp2a levels in mutant tdp - 43 models may therefore present an interesting therapeutic approach in als .

multi - layered thin films with heterogeneous mechanical properties can be spontaneously transformed to realise various three - dimensional ( 3d ) geometries .
here , we describe micro - patterned all - polymer films called micro - rolls that we use for encapsulating , manipulating , and observing adherent cells in vitro .
the micro - rolls are formed of twin - layered films consisting of two polymers with different levels of mechanical stiffness ; therefore they can be fabricated by using the strain engineering and a self - folding rolling process. by controlling the strain of the films geometrically , we can achieve 3d tubular architectures with controllable diameters .
integration with a batch release of sacrificial hydrogel layers provides a high yield and the biocompatibility of the micro - rolls with any length in the release process without cytotoxicity .
thus , the multiple cells can be wrapped in individual micro - rolls and artificially reconstructed into hollow or fibre - shaped cellular 3d constructs that possess the intrinsic morphologies and functions of living tissues .
this system can potentially provide 3d bio - interfaces such as those needed for reconstruction and assembly of functional tissues and implantable tissue grafts .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction three - dimensional ( 3d ) biocompatible architectures are of interest in terms of providing an interface with cells for single - cell assay1 - 3 , tissue engineering4,5 , and transplantation therapeutics1,6 .
they have proven beneficial for providing extracellular micro - environments that mimic hierarchical structures with spatially confined physiological environments of human tissue such as neural tissues4 , muscle fibres4,5 , and blood vessels7,8 , in particular , polymeric structures are expected to create ex vivo 3d cellular constructs with cell - to - cell connections , intrinsic morphologies , and functions , thanks to their high elasticity , biocompatibility , and transparency9,10 .
although various types of 3d fabrication processes including stereo - lithography and laser micromachining techniques have been proposed , there is still a technical limitation as regards constructing micro - or nano - scale polymer structures with controlled 3d geometries .
to achieve 3d bottom - up fabrication , the mechanism of bimetal film transformation2,3,11 has been utilized for polymer - based self - assembly with highly precise geometry12 .
the simple curve of polymeric bilayer films with heterogeneous mechanical properties enables assembly into various 3d forms such as pyramidal13 , tubular14 - 17 , helical18 - 20 , and plant - inspired complex structures21 - 24 .
however , it is technically difficult to apply these 3d geometries to an interface with cells owing to cytotoxic release processes with chemical15 - 18,22 , thermal13,14,19 - 21,24 or electrical23 triggers , which limit the building of 3d cell - laden architectures .
thus , an alternative biocompatible release method is needed if we are to undertake investigations utilizing manual rolling25 , swelling detachment26,27 , intrinsic cell traction force28 , and the release of a stretched elastomeric substrate29 - 31 .
both cell - friendly polymers and biocompatible batch release will surely be used to create ex vivo 3d cellular architectures greater than a centimetre in size with cell - cell connections , intrinsic morphologies , and various functions9 .
in this study , we show that multi - layered polymeric films with heterogeneous mechanical properties can form self - folded rolled shapes ( micro - rolls ) by integrating them with the biocompatible batch release of a hydrogel - based sacrificial layer3,32 .
we used alginate hydrogel as the sacrificial layer for the micro - patterned films , because it can be dissolved by adding chelating agents , thus achieving a spontaneous and non - cytotoxic batch release process with arrayed cell - laden films33 .
the films with sacrificial layers consist entirely of transparent and biocompatible polymers , namely silk fibroin hydrogel , poly ( chloro - p - xylylene ) ( parylene - c ) , and calcium alginate ( ca - alginate ) .
we selected silk fibroin crystalline polymer reconstituted from bombyx mori due to its mechanically robust features34 , high optical transparency35 , and excellent fda / usp - approved biocompatibility as regards implantation36,37 .
parylene - c is also an fda - approved , chemically inert , and nonbiodegradable crystalline polymer , which is extensively used for conformal coatings for medical implants and for mobile interfaces with cells33,38 and tissues39,40 with low cytotoxicity .
while they are not deformable themselves , the combination of silk fibroin with conformally deposited parylene - c will function as a mechanically heterogeneous bilayer that can transform micro - patterned thin film into controlled 3d geometries .
after releasing the sacrificial layer in a non - cytotoxic process , the micro - patterned films are autonomously self - folded into cylindrical shapes based on differential strain gradients which depend on the film thickness .
various 3d cell - laden microstructures formed from two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometrical micro - patterns enable the cells to migrate , connect with each other to form the desired 3d architectures , and synchronize their behaviour within a micro - cavity .
we also use various cell - lines and primary cultured cells to demonstrate that they can reconstitute the intrinsic cellular morphologies and functions .
these results will potentially lead to an effective and versatile way of realising 3d bio - interfaces for such applications as the reconstruction of functional tissues and implantable tissue grafts .
results we fabricated self - foldable films consisting of several layers of mechanically stable and biocompatible polymers , namely parylene - c and silk fibroin35 , on an underlying sacrificial layer of ca - alginate4,33 .
as the fabrication method ( fig. 1a , supplementary fig. s1 ) , ca - alginate and silk fibroin were spin - coated on a sio2 substrate and gelated using both methanol treatment and water - annealing processes in accordance with previously reported protocols41 - 43 .
then , the tops of the films were laminated with parylene - c layer by chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) .
thereafter , the multi - layered film was micro - patterned photolithographically , and etched with oxygen plasma through a photoresist mask , resulting in highly defined geometries28,33,41,44 .
sem images showed clearly identifiable trilaminar films ( fig. 1b , supplementary fig. s2a ) .
energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) spectra showed that the ca - alginate layer possessed ca peaks around 3.7 kev and that the parylene - c layer possessed a cl peak at 2.6 kev ( fig. 1c ) .
the silk fibroin middle layer also exhibited a peak originating from cl , implying that the deposited parylene - c penetrated the silk fibroin layer and enhanced the mutual attraction force between the two films .

scale bars : 400 nm in ( b - 1 ) , 100 nm in ( b - 2 ) , and 100 mum in ( d ) .
to realise self - folding 3d architectures , we dissolved the ca - alginate sacrificial layer by adding ethylene - diaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) .
the ca - alginate layer gradually shrank from the edges of the films , releasing the remaining bilayers and initiating the formation of tubular structures through self - folding ( fig. 1d , supplementary fig. s3 , supplementary movie sm1 ) .
the time dependence of the dissolving area of the ca - alginate layer indicated that the self - folding speed was sensitive to the ambient concentration of edta ( fig. 1e ) 45 .
the curvature of the self - folded micro - rolls ( 1 / rho ) reached an equilibrium value of approximately 0.04 , which was delayed by more than 10 sec after the completion of the ca - alginate dissolution .
since the self - folding process was driven by the difference in stiffness of the bilayer components in the completely swollen state , the slow dissolution of ca - alginate resulted in the failure of the film transformation .
in addition to the slow dissolution of the ca - alginate , the films with non - gelated silk fibroin layers did not become cylindrical but remained flat .
confocal reconstructed images showed that the dimensions of the micropatterns had a noticeable effect on the diameter of the resulting tubular structures ( fig. 1f ) .
we characterized the molecular conformation of the self - folded micro - rolls using ftir and raman spectroscopy .
silk fibroin is widely used as a temporary and soluble supporting thin film because it is amenable to aqueous processing such as methanol treatment42 or water - annealing process43 .
it is also programmable with dissolution rates , depending on the inducement of beta - sheet conformation in crystalline silk .
the ftir spectra from 1450 to 1700 cm - 1 are assigned to the absorption of the peptide backbones in silk fibroin , which was methanol - treated and water - annealed ( fig. 2a ) .
all the spectra of the films containing silk fibroin possessed an absorbance centred at 1625 cm - 1 , which is characteristic of the antiparallel beta - sheet conformation in crystalline silk .
however , the folded micro - rolls exhibited a reduction in absorbance around 1650 cm - 1 , suggesting a transition from the helical conformation of amorphous silk to a beta - sheet - rich conformation35 .
we did not observe any specific differences in the wavelengths of the peaks of the micro - rolls with the curvature radius of 40 mum and 80 mum .
in addition , thanks to its high elastic modulus the beta - sheet - rich matrix of the silk fibroin was maintained without a phase transition after the self - folding step .
on the other hand , when the silk fibroin layer was not treated , the films with fewer peaks around 1650 cm - 1 became cylindrical , and returned to their original flat state after incubation overnight .
the flat micro - rolls did not possess the absorbance peaks centred at both 1625 and 1650 cm - 1 .
this is partly because the silk fibroin that did not undergo chemical , photo - initiated , or shear - stress mechanical crosslinking reactions experienced no polymorphic transition to induce beta - sheets , resulting in higher water solubility34,35,42 .
accordingly , treatment with methanol and water annealing to induce a beta - sheet - rich conformation is an indispensable process as regards maintaining the shape of the micro - rolls and making them sufficiently durable for long - term incubation .
in contrast , the raman spectra included peaks at 1336 and 1608 cm - 1 , corresponding to the deformation of the c - h and c - c bonds in parylene ( fig. 2b ) 46 .
these peaks were present in flat film under both dry and wet conditions and were observed even in folded states as shown in supplementary fig. s2b , thus implying that the parylene layer displayed no defects .
consequently , these results indicate that the invariant chemical components of both parylene - c and gelated silk fibroin hydrogel ensure the structural stability of micro - rolls after the dissolution of the ca - alginate sacrificial layer .

scale bars represent 100 mum .
we applied quantitative predictions of 2d designs to the final geometry to allow us to control the micro - roll architecture .
since the underlying mechanism of self - folding is the stiffness mismatch in the bilayer , the curvature radius of the micro - rolls ( rho ) was modelled using timoshenko 's bimorph beam theory47 .
whereas flory - huggins 's thermodynamic framework is applied to the thermoresponsive or swelling behaviour of homogeneous films with stiffness gradients16,26,48 , this theory based on the bending moment of thin bilayer film beams is employed to predict the curvature radius based on the elastic modulus , layer thickness ( t ) , and strain ( epsilon ) as follows19,21 : 1 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ rho =\ frac { d [ 3 {( 1 + m )}^{ 2 }+( 1 + mn )\{{ m }^{ 2 }+{( mn )}^{ - 1 }\}]}{ 6 ({\ varepsilon }_{{\ rm { p }}} - {\ varepsilon }_{{\ rm { s }}}){( 1 + m )}^{ 2 }}$$\ end { document } rho = d [ 3 ( 1 + m ) 2 +( 1 + mn ){ m2 +( mn ) - 1 }] 6 ( epsilonp - epsilons )( 1 + m ) 2where n is the relative elastic modulus , m is the ratio of the bilayer thickness ( m = t p / t s ) , d is the total thickness ( d = t p + t s ) , and the subscripts " p " and " s " denote parylene and silk fibroin , respectively ( fig. 2c , supplementary information 2 - 3 ) .
for simplicity , t s was kept constant and rho was measured in the equilibrium state as a function of varying parylene film thickness ( t p ) .
the experimental rho value is plotted as a function of t p ranging from 40 to 500 nm ( fig. 2d , the standard deviation is less than 2.64 mum ) .
we measured the elastic modulus of silk fibroin in the completely swollen state , which is a key parameter for simulating the final 3d geometry of micro - rolls .
the value of the elastic modulus calculated from tensile stress versus engineering strain curves by using a tension testing device equipped with 50 n load cells was estimated to be approximately 80 mpa ( supplementary fig. s4e ) .
additionally , rho is proportional to the width ( w ) when the aspect ratio is constant ( w / l = 0.5 ) , and constant with variable length ( l ) when both w and t are constant ( fig. 2e , supplementary fig. s4f,g ) .
since the experimental values of rho mostly follow the trend predicted by equation ( 1 ) , we concluded that the curvature radii of micro - rolls can be analytically predicted using timoshenko 's theory .
in addition to the cylindrical shape , various 3d geometries can be controlled and self - folded depending on the design of the 2d micropatterns .
for instance , flower and cross micropatterns were transformed into grippers and t - junctions , respectively ( fig. 2f,g ). by combining rectangles with cross - shaped hinges , a unique doll - shaped 3d structure was self - folded where the rectangles correspond to the body and limbs , and a circle forms the head ( fig. 2h ) .
in addition , the cross portion connecting the arms retained the backbone shape , consequently making it possible to maintain the 3d doll geometry .
hence , by incorporating the branched structure in the pattern interior , it is possible to produce more complex 3d shapes such as doll - shaped , zigzag - shaped , and caged skeletal frames ( supplementary fig. s5 , supplementary movie sm2 ) .
the key challenge when fabricating cell - laden micro - rolls is to realise tubular structures with cyto - compatibility and to confirm the cell function within the micro - rolls .
for a microscopic evaluation of biocompatibility and an investigation of the morphological and migration properties , we encapsulated two types of cell - lines within the micro - rolls : chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) and human embryonic kidney ( hek ) cells .
to produce micro - rolls with a curvature radius of approximately 40 mum , we employed parylene and silk fibroin with thickness of 145 and 210 nm , respectively. with the addition of edta , the cells on the 2d film surface were encapsulated inside the 3d micro - rolls through the self - folding of the bilayer ( fig. 3a , supplementary fig. s6 , supplementary movie sm3 ) .
confocal cross - sectional images revealed that arrayed micro - rolls encapsulated a large number of cells at a time and separated them from cells outside the patterned area ( fig. 3b - d , supplementary movie sm4 ) .
a live / dead assay revealed that more than 95 % of the cells were alive inside the micro - rolls , indicating that the self - folding and encapsulation process is sufficiently gentle to avoid cell damage .
therefore , arrayed micro - rolls have the potential to create highly parallel assays for investigating cellular behaviours including proliferation and differentiation .
since the curvature radius and length of the micro - rolls are controllable , the number of encapsulated cells is easily adjusted by varying the suspended cell density and the micro - roll volume ( fig. 3e ) .

the enlarged confocal image on the right shows a cross - sectional view of a hollow structure .

the high biocompatibility and transparency of the micro - rolls enabled encapsulated cells to be stably incubated inside the rolls and allowed the observation of cell behaviour such as migration and proliferation , using various types of microscopy .
during the incubation , the encapsulated cells migrated and proliferated only within the micro - rolls and there was no migration out .
this allows the formation of cell - cell contacts along the inner surfaces of the micro - rolls .
the micro - rolls with encapsulated cells provide not only the transparency needed for microscope observations , but also sufficient mechanical strength to withstand the cell traction force .
this phenomenon is comparable to that found in previous studies on not only cell encapsulation2,3,49 , but also migration50 and proliferation51 within strain - engineered inorganic nano - membranes that offer a 3d environment for neural cells with a well - defined geometry .
hek cells exhibit relatively strong cell - to - cell contact , and so the cells in a micro - roll aggregated and completely filled the micro - roll cavity after 1 day of culture ( fig. 3f - 1 ) .
in contrast , cho cells are likely to exist individually , meaning that they adhered preferentially to the inner surfaces of the rolls and formed hollow vessel - like constructs ( fig. 3f - 2 , f - 3 ) .
the integration with various 3d geometries of cell - aggregates shown in supplementary fig. s6 and encapsulated endothelial cells has potentials to produce architectures that mimic micro - scale vasculatures52 .
moreover , the shapes of the cell clusters differed depending on the micro - roll volume and the cell - line 's adhesive properties .
as firstly exploited in si / sio2 micro - rolls in a study of yeast cell behaviour53 , the high transparency of the micro - rolls' materials did not interfere with the light paths of microscopes .
therefore , it is possible to equip both upright and inverted microscopes with a micro - roll system for the long - term time - lapsed observation of encapsulated cells .
a picolitre fluid flow with a glass capillary enabled the manipulation and relocation of cell - laden micro - rolls by smoothly withdrawing the structure into the capillary and releasing it at the target location ( fig. 3g , supplementary fig. s7 , supplementary movie sm5 ) .
while being conveyed inside the glass capillaries , the micro - rolls stably maintained their cylindrical shapes and held the cells without them being buckled or bent .
therefore , individual cells inside the micro - rolls could be collected , placed like building blocks , and successfully transported to the target position to induce cell - to - cell contact ( fig. 3h ) .
the cell behaviour after long - term incubation is totally dependent on the surface modification of the substrates to which the micro - rolls were conveyed ( supplementary fig. s6b - d ) .
the hek cells located on the ecm - coated substrates proliferated and migrated outside the micro - rolls .
in contrast , the cells transferred to mpc polymer - coated substrates completely filled the micro - roll cavity , and then migrated onto the outer silk fibroin surface of the micro - rolls .
note that the cells on micro - rolls were manipulated without stripping them from their growth surfaces , which allowed the adhesive state of the manipulated cells to be preserved .
this has the potential to facilitate high - order cellular assembly for potential use in tissue engineering by enabling the manipulation of individual cell types into any desired multi - cell - line combination .
we investigated physiological functions using two primary rat cells : cardiomyocytes and neural cells .
in contrast to the cell lines , neither primary hippocampal cells nor cardiomyocytes proliferate spontaneously after incubation , and their cell bodies took their position only in the micro - rolls .
primary cardiomyocytes agglomerated and formed a tubular structure in 20 mm - long micro - rolls after 5 days of culture ( fig. 4a ) .
figure 4b shows optical images and time - dependent displacement ( black - and - white images ) at corresponding pixel locations , which we estimated by subtracting the average intensity from all the images in a stack ( supplementary fig. s8 , supplementary movie sm6 ) .
we observed that the intensity corresponding to the displacement revealed that all the cardiomyocytes connected inside the micro - rolls synchronously contracted in the same period at approximately 1 hz. a time - lapse fluorescence image measurement of fluo - 4 - labelled cells indicated that the oscillation of intracellular ca2 + propagated and was synchronized within the micro - rolls ( fig. 4c ) .
the microenvironment provided by micro - rolls of any length could regulate the cell migration and cell - cell interactions and so drive intrinsic morphologies and functions .

scale bars : 100 mum in ( a - g,i,j ) , and 50 mum in ( h ) .
primary hippocampal cells were also encapsulated to reconstitute neural tissues .
first , the encapsulated cells aggregated to form spheroids , and subsequently extended their dendrites in the micro - roll direction ( fig. 4d , supplementary movie sm7 ) .
after 3 days of culture , the neurite - mediated cell - cell connection between the spheroids resulted in the formation of unidirectionally oriented neural cell fibres ( fig. 4e ) .
somas and their neurites were both located inside the micro - rolls without any protrusion ( fig. 4f ) .
interestingly , the neurites were further extended outside the micro - rolls and connected with neighbouring cells ( fig. 4g,h ) .
we used immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy to study the cell morphology with neurite outgrowth and intracellular components .
actin fibres were probed with alexa fluor 594 - conjugated phalloidin ( supplementary fig. s9a,b , right ) .
somatic , dendritic , and axonal proteins distributed across the cytoskeletons were visualised with alexa fluor 488 - conjugated pan neuronal marker monoclonal antibody ( supplementary fig. s9a,b , centre ) .
they demonstrated that both somas and their neurites were positionally restricted within the micro - rolls , and adhered around the circumference of the micro - rolls .
as shown in supplementary movie sm7 , the encapsulated primary hippocampal cells firstly aggregated to form spheroids .
since the location of spheroids of hippocampal cells was random , some spheroids were located in the edge of micro - rolls ( s9a , centre ) , and the others were evenly distributed inside the micro - rolls ( s9b , centre ) .
regardless of the location of spheroids , their dendrites were extended and evenly distributed in the micro - roll after long - term incubation ( s9a - b , right ) .
we also evaluated the textile orientation of the neurite and actin fibre of evenly distributed hippocampal cells and their neurites within the micro - rolls quantitatively .
we undertook an image analysis of projected images using a custom fast fourier transform ( fft ) with a gaussian filter ( supplementary fig. s9c,d ) .
while the brightness distribution of the fft image of the neurites of the hippocampal cells in the bulk was isotropic , that of the inner neurites peaked in the long axis direction of the micro - rolls .
we also found that textiles fabricated using actin fibres were highly orientated towards the long axis of the micro - rolls .
in contrast , when the cells were grown on a flat substrate , the arrangement and location of somas and neurite outgrowths appeared to be random .
these results quantitatively suggest that the micro - rolls provide the geometric confinement of dense cell aggregates and the unidirectional alignment of neurites .
to further investigate the accessibility of neurites to the outer surface , we examined cellular responses to external stimulation with added glutamic acid .
when the glutamic acid receptors in the hippocampal cells were activated , intracellular ca2 + ions were detectable by calcium indicators using confocal laser scanning microscopy .
fluo - 4 labelled cells exhibited spontaneous ca2 + oscillations that were synchronized across the cells via synaptic connections , whereas the cells that were not connected via neurites showed no oscillation signals ( fig. 4i ) .
this result indicates that the encapsulated cells come into direct contact and build up a cellular network with the cells outside of the micro - rolls through hollow structures in order to transmit and exchange information with their neighbouring cells .
after 2 weeks of culture , the extended neurites from the manipulated cell - laden micro - rolls were connected and bridged to realise cell - to - cell contact between neighbouring micro - rolls ( fig. 4j ) .
this reconstitution of a neurite - mediated network is also reasonably consistent with and equivalent to previous reports on al2o3 / sio / sio2 54 , si / ge55 , or gaas / ingaas56 nanomembrane microtube structures with guided encapsulated neurons and their elongated neurites. with daily medium exchanges and cell maintenance , the biocompatibility of silk fibroin and parylene ensured the long - term culture (> 1 month ) of encapsulated cells without cytotoxicity .
consequently , the relocated cells can recreate intercellular communication with the cells outside of micro - rolls , serving as building units of higher - order tissue assemblies and potential implantable grafts in vivo .
discussion in summary , we demonstrated that a multi - layered polymer film could change its shape into a programmed 3d configuration dependent upon its original 2d geometry .
the self - folding mechanism is based on the bending of bilayer films and is potentially applicable to any constituent materials .
moreover , by combining this characteristic with other designs that undergo significant dimensional changes , it would be possible to construct more complex 3d artificial tissues .
notably , owing to the higher elasticity of parylene and silk fibroin , the micro - rolls help to develop a fibre - shaped cellular construct and as a result the contractile motion of the primary myocytes and synaptic connections of highly oriented primary neural cells could be achieved .
this method could be expanded to many other adherent cell lines for the reconstruction of fibre - shaped functional tissues that mimic muscle fibres57 , blood vessels58,59 , and nerve networks in vitro 60,61 .
all the polymeric materials we used for our micro - rolls , including the sacrificial layer , are transparent , biocompatible , and robust .
their transparency facilitates the study of any cellular response such as calcium oscillation and the fluorescent observation of an immunostained cytoskeleton , as exploited in the si / sio2 micro - rolls used for studying yeast cell behaviour53 .
the biocompatible micro - rolls in this study neither require cytotoxic etchant nor suffer from the stochastic encapsulation of cells that voluntarily migrate in , unlike conventional self - folded , inorganic cylinders2,3,62 .
this is attributable to the non - cytotoxic removal of the sacrificial hydrogel layer ( ca - alginate ) , which enables the batch encapsulation of multiple cells .
the combination of more than two types of transparent polymers in the bilayer should be both compatible with the underlying ca - alginate , modifiable with an appropriately coated appropriate ecm , and resistant to chemical etching in the fabrication process .
as these materials , we specifically selected silk fibroin and parylene - c as the transparent polymer with heterogeneous high elastic moduli , approximately 3 gpa and 80 mpa , respectively ( supplementary information 2 - 3 ) .
weak adhesion in layered hydrogel film also makes it difficult to scale down to the nano / micro level and limits the generation of stiffness gradients , which compelled us to induce a stress gradient in homogeneous films .
the micro - rolls proposed in this study were improved by coating the film with parylene using cvd , which resulted in the fabrication of single - cell - sized 3d structures with highly precise geometry in the same manner as bimetal films .
if the micro - rolls meet the above requirements , they will not be limited as regards type of polymeric material , for instance , su - 816 , poly ( n - isopropylacrylamide ) 13,14 , polycaprolactone10 , or poly ( ethylene glycol ) 26 could be used .
furthermore , our self - folded cylindrical 3d structures contained few wrinkles or deflections , and we were able to produce a fibre - shaped cellular morphology and promote the correct cellular functions .
the biocompatibility of silk fibroin and parylene also ensured the long - term encapsulation , culture (> 1 month ) , and manipulation of encapsulated adherent cells without cytotoxicity , in a similar manner to conventional self - folded 3d hollow structures made of metals for culturing adherent cells .
importantly , the adherent cells inside the micro - rolls can be stably encapsulated and manipulated while retaining their adhesive properties .
although the manipulation of cell - laden micro - rolls demonstrated here was entirely manually operated , our platform could be incorporated with an encapsulated magnet - responsive layer44,63 or a microfluidic system64 in order to achieve fast , reliable , and automated manipulation65,66 .
the distance - mediated interconnection of elongated neurites between more than two neuron - laden micro - rolls is worth of a detailed investigation involving optimising their sizes , location , and patterns from the perspective of building synthetic neural circuits and tissue engineering54 - 56. by harnessing this high handleability , the assembly and reconstruction of highly oriented primary neural cells could be achieved .
in future , this method could be expanded to reconstruct tissues with various shapes in vitro that are suitable for exploring single - cell assays , tissue engineering , and implantable ex vivo tissue grafts .
methods the methods are described in full in supplementary information .
material preparation we used silk fibroin hydrogel , parylene , and ca - alginate as biocompatible materials for micro - roll fabrication .
dichloro - di ( p - xylylene ) ( parylene , dpx - c ) powder was purchased from speedline technology , usa .
aqueous silk fibroin solution was produced from the cocoons of bombyx mori ( b. mori ) silkworms .
briefly , the silk cocoons ( satoyama craft , japan ) were degummed for 30 min in a boiling 20 mm solution of sodium carbonate to remove silk sericin protein and then rinsed with distilled water .
the extracted silk fibroin fibres were dried overnight and then dissolved in a 9.3 m lithium bromide solution ( tokyo chemical industry co. , ltd. japan ) for 4 h. this was followed by a dialysis step with spectra / por ( r ) dialysis tubing ( mwco 3500 k , spectrum , inc. , usa ) to convert the solvent to distilled water , yielding a 40 mg / ml solution of silk fibroin .
alginate sodium salt ( a2033 , sigma , usa ) was dissolved in distilled water to form an aqueous solution of sodium alginate .
a positive photoresist ( s1813g ) and microposit 351 developer were purchased from rohm and haas ( usa ) .
cell preparation and suspension chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) , human embryonic kidney ( hek ) , human foreskin fibroblast ( hff ) , and human hepato - cellular carcinoma ( huh - 7 ) cell lines were purchased from ds pharma biomedical , japan .
the cells were cultured in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem , thermofisher , usa ) containing 10 % foetal bovine serum ( fbs ) supplemented with 1 % l - glutamine and 10 mug / ml gentamicin ( invitrogen , usa ) .
all the cells were maintained at 37 degreesc in a humidified incubator containing 5 % co2 .
primary neuronal cells and cardiomyocytes were prepared from the hippocampi and hearts of 18th day embryo ( e18 ) wistar rats .
the hippocampi were trypsinized , dissociated with 0.5 mg / ml trypsin ( gibco , thermo fisher scientific inc. , usa ) for 10 min , and mechanically triturated .
the cell suspension was washed in centrifuges and filtrated , and then the cells were plated onto micro - rolls at the indicated initial densities .
the hippocampal cell cultures were maintained in supplemented neurobasal medium ( gibco ) with the addition of 0.5 mm glutamine ( sigma - aldrich , usa ) , 25 mum glutamate ( sigma - aldrich ) , 50 mug / ml gentamicin ( gibco ) , and 2 % b - 27 supplement ( gibco ) .
the cardiac tissues were trypsinised , dissociated by 0.05 % trypsin - edta ( gibco ) for 30 min , and inhibited with 0.05 % trypsin inhibitor ( gibco ) .
the cardiomyocyte cultures were maintained in dmem supplemented with the addition of 5 % horse serum ( gibco ) , 5 % foetal bovine serum ( gibco ) , 2.5 mug / ml insulin ( sigma - aldrich ) , 100 u / ml penicillin , and 100 mug / ml streptomycin ( sigma - aldrich ) .
the cells were maintained in a 5 % co2 incubator at 37 degreesc with saturated humidity .
all experimental procedures involving animals were approved by and conducted in accordance with the institutional animal care and ethics committees of nippon telegraph and telephone corporation ( ntt ) and ntt science and core technology laboratory group ( experimental protocol no .
rin2014 - 04 ) , which are in compliance with the guidelines for the proper conduct of animal experiments of the science council of japan ( kohyo - 20 - k16 - 2 , 2006 ) .
micro - roll fabrication supplementary fig. s1 shows the process we used to fabricate micro - sized micro - rolls .
a 2 wt % solution of sodium alginate was spin - coated on either silicon wafers or sio2 substrates at a maximum speed of 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. the substrates were then immersed in 100 mm calcium chloride ( wako pure chemical , japan ) to form an alginate hydrogel layer with ca2 + ions .
the silk fibroin solution was drawn up by a syringe with an 18 - g needle and spin - coated on the surface of an alginate hydrogel layer at various speeds for 30 s. the result was immersed in methanol ( kanto chemical , japan ) for 2 days to produce silk fibroin hydrogel layers that were 50 - 400 nm thick .
when the solution was not drawn through a syringe , the micro - rolls began to refold in the opposite direction and became flat .
then , a layer of parylene 50 - 500 nm thick was deposited using a chemical deposition system ( labcoater pds2010 , usa ) .
inside the deposition system , parylene was first vaporized at 150 degreesc , and then pyrolysed at 690 degreesc to generate chloro - p - xylylene monomer .
a reduction in the chamber temperature caused chloro - p - xylylene to condense onto the silk fibroin layer to form parylene membranes .
the parylene - c thickness was controlled by controlling the weight of the initially loaded dichloro - di ( p - xylylene ) at a rate of approximately 0.625 mum / g. after the parylene deposition , photoresist was spin - coated , exposed to ultraviolet light through chromium photo - masks , and developed in microposit 351 .
then , the triple - layered film composed of alginate hydrogel , silk fibroin , and parylene was etched with o2 plasma ( cv - e300 , mory engineering , japan ) to fabricate a micro - patterned film array .
finally , the residual photoresist was removed with acetone ( kanto chemical , japan ) .
the array was exposed to uv light for 5 min for sterilization and stored in a vacuum desiccator prior to use .

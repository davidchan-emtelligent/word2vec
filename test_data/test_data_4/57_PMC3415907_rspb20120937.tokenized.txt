punishment can stabilize costly cooperation and ensure the success of a common project that is threatened by free - riders .
punishment mechanisms can be classified into pool punishment , where the punishment act is carried out by a paid third party , ( e.g. a police system or a sheriff ) , and peer punishment , where the punishment act is carried out by peers .
which punishment mechanism is preferred when both are concurrently available within a society ?
in an economic experiment , we show that the majority of subjects choose pool punishment , despite being costly even in the absence of defectors , when second - order free - riders , cooperators that do not punish , are also punished .
pool punishers are mutually enforcing their support for the punishment organization , stably trapping each other .
our experimental results show how organized punishment could have displaced individual punishment in human societies .
evolution of cooperation peer punishment pool punishment 1 .
introduction it has been suggested that large - scale cooperation in humans is maintained because wrongdoers are punished [ 1,2 ] , either by ' peer punishment ' [ 3 - 12 ] , where individuals decide to punish others in a dyadic way , or by ' pool punishment ' [ 13 - 18 ] , a kind of tax - paid organization to which punishment is outsourced .
intermediate punishment systems , where only some subjects are allowed to punish , have also been analysed [ 19,20 ] .
peer punishment is studied theoretically , experimentally and in naturally occurring environments [ 21 ] as a mechanism to stabilize cooperation in public goods games , social dilemmas in which the success of a common project is threatened by the individual temptation to free - ride on the contributions of others [ 22 - 26 ] .
when stakes are low , we sometimes use peer punishment by personally reprimanding wrongdoers [ 27 ] , a rare event in modern societies as we hardly ever observe commuters assaulting fare - dodgers or tax - payers affronting defrauders .
in his leviathan , hobbes [ 28 ] suggested that the consent of people could lead to a central authority that punishes those who violate the laws of the society .
at present times , these central authorities are institutions such as the police , to which punishment has been outsourced .
how can such institutions emerge when they are initially inefficient [ 24 ] ?
in which situation is it better to rely on peer punishment and when does it pay to invest into pool punishment ?
when both options are available within a society , which one is preferred ?
we designed a behavioural experiment based on a public goods game to address these questions .
in a typical public goods game , all players can choose whether to cooperate and invest into a common pool or to defect and enjoy the benefit of the public good without investing .
the invested sum is then multiplied by a constant factor and distributed among all participants .
since defecting free - riders earn more than cooperators , cooperation typically breaks down [ 29 ] .
a possibility to overcome this is to give cooperators the option to peer punish and prosecute the free - riders , even if this is costly .
however , there are several issues with this approach : in the short run , the efficiency cost due to peer punishment compensates or even overrides the gains from the public good [ 30 - 32 ] , so only in the long run can peer punishment become worthwhile [ 8 ] .
it works only if enough information is available [ 33 ] and the fine - to - fee ratio is high enough [ 34 ] .
counter punishment [ 35 ] or antisocial punishment [ 36 ] can lead to additional efficiency loss .
moreover , punishment itself is a second - order public good , and thus threatened by second - order free - riders who contribute to the public good , but do not punish [ 37 - 39 ] .
unless it can be coordinated [ 40 ] , the initial emergence of a peer punishment system is problematic [ 41,42 ] .
peer punishment occurs individually , and after the public - goods interaction it resembles revenge .
peer punishment is reactive ( and may be emotional ) , whereas pool punishment requires planning .
pool punishers contribute ' taxes' to maintain a punishment system .
building up such a pool punishment system requires investments before free - riding occurs and it is costly to keep up the system even in the absence of wrongdoers [ 13,43 ] .
it appears that the very nature of pool punishment is that a decision to support an organization which punishes defectors in case they show up has to be made before it is known that defectors are present .
in this case , the costs to maintain the pool punishment organization ( e.g. a sheriff or the police ) must be independent of the later presence of defectors : it may appear to be low when many individuals are punished , but the amount is exactly the same when not a single person has to be punished .
this is different from peer punishment , where each defector is punished in dyadic interactions .
thus , the cost of peer punishment is proportional to the number of people punished , but in contrast to pool punishment there is no cost when no one has to be punished .
peer punishers react to defectors directly , whereas pool punishers plan ahead and establish an organization for punishment .
in its simplest form , pool punishment can be implemented by electing and paying an individual to perform the punishment [ 20 ] .
instead of allowing subjects to shape their own punishment organization , we implement the consequences of different punishment organizations that subjects can choose from .
putterman et al .
[ 44 ] have tested voting for such formal sanction schemes for the group experimentally .
they propose that one should investigate the choice between formal and informal sanctions when both are available .
this approach was mathematically modelled by sigmund et al .
[ 16 ] and herein we test the predictions of that model experimentally .
our basic assumptions are the same as those in the model of sigmund et al .
[ 16 ] , which compares peer and pool punishment in a public goods game without and with second - order punishment ( i.e. the punishment of those who cooperate , but do not punish ) .
in addition to cooperators , defectors and the two forms of punishment , sigmund et al. introduced loners , who abstain from the common enterprise entirely and rely on a small , but secure income [ 45,46 ] .
the model compares peer and pool punishment alone incorporated into a public goods game as well as the combined availability of both forms of punishment .
in summary , the model predicts that ( i ) the use of peer punishment is not greatly affected by the presence or absence of second - order punishment , which also has no effect on the efficiency ( i.e. the average payoff of each individual in each round ) .
( ii ) pool punishment is only used in the presence of second - order punishment , but it substantially decreases efficiency .
( iii ) if both punishment mechanisms are available , peer punishment is used more frequently in the absence of second - order punishment , but pool punishment prevails in the presence of second - order punishment , again with decreased efficiency .
the predictions of this evolutionary model are tested experimentally herein .
2. methods we have designed experimental public goods games with volunteers to study how peer and pool punishment alone ( treatments ( a ) and ( b )) and their combination ( treatment ( c )) are used in the absence or presence of second - order punishment. with second - order punishment , all those who cooperate but do not punish have to pay the same fine as the defectors ( cf. [ 3 ] for a discussion of this assumption ) .
in peer punishment , second - order punishment typically implied additional costs ( because additional individuals have to be punished ) , whereas in pool punishment this was covered by a single tax .
groups within each treatment played three consecutive public goods games ; the first and second games were used to familiarize the players with each punishment regime separately , while the third game was used to provide results ( table 1 ) .
individuals could make general decisions on whether to punish a certain action , but they did not have an opportunity to target a particular individual .
table 1 .
overview of the experimental design .
in games 1 and 2 , subjects gained experience with the two punishment mechanisms in isolation , both without and with second - order punishment .
only the results of game 3 are analysed further .
treatments ( a ) and ( b ) are controls .
rounds treatment ( a ) groups treatment ( b ) groups treatment ( c ) groups second - order punishment initial account game without with 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 4 x 4 x 1 5 5 euro 12 peer pool peer pool peer pool 2 5 5 euro 12 pool peer pool peer pool peer 3 10 15 euro 24 peer peer pool pool peer and pool peer and pool in treatments ( a ) and ( b ) , we had six groups of five subjects ; in treatment ( c ) we had eight groups of five subjects ( see table 1 ) .
the groups remained the same throughout games 1 - 3 .
individual decisions were made in a series of yes or no questions .
in each round , the players first had to choose between being a loner ( fixed gain of euro 0.40 ) and taking part in a public goods ( pg ) game .
those subjects deciding for the pg game can contribute either euro 0 or euro 0.50 to the public pool from their initial endowment of euro 12 ( euro 24 in game 3 ; see table 1 ) .
the money in the pool was multiplied by 3.1 and redistributed to all pg players .
in each of the three games either peer punishment , pool punishment or combined peer and pool punishment was added to the pg game .
for peer punishment , the cost for punishing was euro 0.50 per punished individual , whereas the cost for being punished was euro 1.00 per punisher .
in pool punishment , the cost for punishing was euro 0.50 and the cost for being punished was euro 1.00 , as in the theory paper .
in all cases , punishment is costly and thus leads to an efficiency loss .
as in the mathematical model , the level of efficiency depends on the cost of punishment , which can be chosen as a parameter .
therefore , the experiment could have been designed in such a way that the stable pool punishment solution is also highly efficient , but this would have precluded distinguishing whether subjects prefer the stable to the efficient solution .
in peer punishment , the decision to punish ( pay euro 0.50 per player who did not invest to impose a fine of euro 1.00 ) was made by the individual after they had obtained the information on contributions .
in pool punishment , the decision to pay taxes for the punishment organization ( pay euro 0.50 such that each player who did not invest must pay euro 1.00 per tax payer ) had to be made before the information on contributions was available .
in the experiment , we have called this organization ' police ' , because the subjects can easily relate this to real life .
when both forms of punishment were combined , the pool punishment decision had to be made before the information on contributions was available , while the peer punishment decisions thereafter , however without knowledge about pool punishment decisions .

3. results in all treatments of our experiment ( table 1 ) , we found that the majority of players cooperate , both with and without second - order punishment .
this is also expected from the model .
an overview of all significant results is presented in figure 1 .
figure 1 .
overview over the relevant significant experimental results .
in treatment ( b ) , the introduction of second - order punishment led to a significant increase in the level of cooperation , a significant decrease in defection and a significant reduction in efficiency .
in treatment ( c ) , there is significantly more pool punishment than peer punishment in the absence of second - order punishment .
if it is introduced , the level of defection and the use of peer punishment significantly decrease .
the use of pool punishment significantly increases ; the efficiency is reduced significantly. with second - order punishment , pool punishment prevails ( i.e. the number of players using pool punishment is significantly different from 50 %) .
within treatment ( a ) , the changes after the introduction of second - order punishment were not significant .
see s3 for details .
treatment ( a ) considered peer punishment incorporated into the public goods game , where the subjects can postpone the punishment decision to the end of each round ( see figure 2a ) .
we observed no significant differences in the level of cooperation or in the efficiency between the absence and presence of second - order punishment , which corroborates the model 's prediction .
as in the model , the absence or presence of second - order punishment did not lead to significant differences in the frequency of defectors or loners .
we observed a large fraction of cooperators that do not punish and there is little need to punish .
the model 's prediction is that peer punishment ' prevails ' , which means that the majority of the population adopts that strategy after some time .
this can be analysed by testing whether the frequency of a strategy is above 50 per cent ( i.e. whether it prevails ) .
to answer this question , we focused on the last 10 rounds of game 3 , when subjects had sufficient time to settle on a strategy .
on average , the majority of the subjects used peer punishment in only 27 per cent of the rounds , which is below but not significantly different from a base value of 50 per cent ( wilcoxon one - sample test : n = 6 groups ; we treat whole groups as statistical units and use two - tailed tests throughout , z = - 1.444 , p = 0.1486 ) .
here , the model 's prediction was not supported , but if there is no defector , there is no reason to punish in the experiment see ( figure 2a ) .
in fact , choosing punishment in such a case does not have any effect .
figure 2 .
dynamics of decision - making in game 3 , which had 25 rounds .
( i ) fraction of decisions to cooperate , defect or act as a loner in the three treatments ( see table 1 for details ) .
( ii ) efficiency ( i.e. the average payoff in euros ) per individual per round , and the fraction of players using punishment ( both quantities happened to be of a similar range ) .
the vertical lines mark the introduction of second - order punishment after round 10 , which has a large impact in the experiments with pool punishment , where it reduces the efficiency significantly .
in treatments ( a ) and ( c ) , the average level of cooperation is slightly affected by second - order punishment only , but in treatment ( b ) , second - order punishment significantly increases the level of cooperation .
in isolation , pool punishment is used much more frequently than peer punishment in the presence of second - order punishment .
if we combine both forms of punishment , pool punishment clearly prevails and little peer punishment is used ( averages over six groups in peer punishment and pool punishment , eight groups in peer and pool punishment ) .
treatment ( b ) considered pool punishment incorporated into the public goods game ( see figure 2b ) .
in the absence of second - order punishment , the punishment strategy was used rarely .
without second - order punishment , there were no significant differences in the level of cooperation ( mann - whitney u - test : n1 = n2 = 6 , z = - 0.241 , p = 0.8095 ) or the level of defection ( mann - whitney u - test : n1 = n2 = 6 , z = - 0.641 , p = 0.261 ) between pool and peer punishment .
however , once second - order punishment was added , the majority of players seemed to invest into pool punishment .
this significantly increased the level of cooperation ( wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test : n = 6 , z = - 1.992 , p = 0.046 ) , and escalated the use of pool punishment ( wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test : n = 6 , z = - 1.992 , p = 0.046 ; see figure 2b ) .
the introduction of second - order punishment did not seem to influence the decisions to act as a loner , but it suppressed the number of defectors ( wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test : n = 6 , z = - 2.207 , p = 0.027 ) .
however , the suppression of defection did not pay out , as second - order punishment substantially reduced the net average payoff in euros ( i.e. efficiency ) per individual compared with the situation without second - order punishment ( wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test : n = 6 , z = - 1.992 , p = 0.046 ) .
the introduction of second - order punishment led to a loss in efficiency of about a third .
despite the increase in the use of pool punishment , it did not significantly prevail in the last 10 rounds of game 3 : on average in 83 per cent of these rounds , the majority of subjects chose pool punishment , but this is not significantly different from the base value of 50 per cent ( wilcoxon one - sample test : n = 6 , z = - 1.633 , p = 0.1025 ) .
in treatment ( c ) , both forms of punishment were combined .
as in the other treatments , the level of cooperation was high , with no significant differences between the absence and the presence of second - order punishment ( see figure 2c ) .
in the absence of second - order punishment the level of cooperation was significantly higher than in pool punishment alone ( mann - whitney u - test : n1 = 6 , n2 = 8 , z = - 2.144 , p = 0.032 ) and the level of defection was lower ( mann - whitney u - test : n1 = 6 , n2 = 8 , z = - 2.591 , p = 0.010 ) .
this effect must have resulted from the interaction between peer and pool punishment .
however , the level of pool punishment was still slightly higher than the level of peer punishment ( wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test : n = 8 , z = - 2.047 , p = 0.043 ) .
once second - order punishment was introduced , the use of pool punishment increased ( wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test : n = 8 , z = - 2.521 , p = 0.012 ; see figure 2c ) .
the fraction of defectors decreased when second - order punishment was added ( wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test : n = 8 , z = - 2.371 , p = 0.018 ) .
in the presence of two punishment mechanisms , the incentive to cooperate seems to be high : at the time when players decided about cooperation or defection , it was unknown if pool punishers had already committed to punish defectors .
but even if no one did , there was still the option of peer punishment later .
again , second - order punishment led to a substantial loss in efficiency compared with the situation without second - order punishment ( wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test : n = 8 , z = - 2.521 , p = 0.012 ) .
the level of peer punishment decreased further to almost zero ( wilcoxon matched - pairs signed - rank test : n = 8 , z = - 2.366 , p = 0.018 ) , but this was not significantly different from the level in peer punishment alone ( figure 2a ; mann - whitney u - test : n1 = 6 , n2 = 8 , z = - 0.784 , p = 0.4733 ) .
in the last 10 rounds of game 3 , we did not observe a single instance where at least three players used peer punishment .
pool punishment clearly prevailed : on average , in 87.5 per cent of the last 10 rounds , the majority of subjects chose pool punishment , which is significantly higher than 50 per cent ( wilcoxon one - sample test : n = 8 , z = - 2.121 , p = 0.034 ) .
when second - order punishment was added and pool punishment had been established , it was very difficult to escape contributing to pool punishment .
for the group , cooperation without punishment would be a more profitable option , but it is very difficult to achieve .
4. discussion so far , the vast majority of theoretical and experimental studies on enforcement of cooperation in public goods games has been based on peer punishment .
it has little effect on efficiency , because the destructive consequences of punishment occur rarely when the game is repeated for enough rounds - - typically the threat of possible punishment suffices .
in our case , the maximum average payoff was euro 0.79 +/ - 0.25 , which is below the theoretical optimum of euro 1.05 occurring when all players cooperate but no one punishes .
when only pool punishment was available , the level of cooperation was not significantly different from peer punishment without second - order punishment .
pool punishment was rarely used in this case , as expected. with second - order punishment ( i.e. the punishment of cooperators who do not punish ) , pool punishment , however , improved the stability of cooperation , but led to a loss of efficiency ( i.e. a decrease in the average payoff per individual and round ) approximately euro 0.51 +/ - 0.48 .
in fact , the pool punishment system was so costly that it would have been beneficial to abandon it in favour of peer punishment .
in this study , every defector faced the same fine under pool punishment due to the absence of individual differences in defection .
in order to test its predictions , we had to follow the mathematical model and implemented a pool punishment mechanism that was less efficient than other more sophisticated approaches .
for example , one could punish only the largest deviator in the way to give her / him a precise incentive to cooperate more , as andreoni & gee [ 17 ] proposed .
another approach is to assume that a small number of punishers is sufficient to achieve an optimal punishment effciency [ 40,47 ] , which is similar to the volunteer 's dilemma [ 48,49 ] .
when both peer and pool punishment are available within the social group , both punishment options were used at a low level in the absence of second - order punishment , but their interaction significantly enhanced cooperation .
in the presence of second - order punishment , pool punishers dominated and prevailed , corroborating with the model 's prediction .
since thereafter any other strategy has a lower payoff , pool punishers mutually enforced each other not to deviate , and thus the situation was stable .
however , ' efficiency is traded for stability ' ([ 16 ] , p .
861 ) ; stable cooperation comes at a price that reflects the fact that taxes for the organizational punishment had to be paid even in the absence of defectors .
similar to the theoretical study that motivated our experiment [ 16 ] , it turned out that second - order punishment is crucial for the maintenance of pool punishment .
the major result of the corresponding theoretical model [ 16 ] that peer and pool punishment can evolve by individual selection alone was supported by our experimental findings : our players have democratically built up a pool punishment organization within their group and have forgone the opportunity to decide individually who is to be punished , as predicted .
pool punishment seemed to be a safe haven , but it came at a significant loss of efficiency .
following hobbes , the goal of the establishment of a central authority is not to achieve the best for all , but to prevent the worst for all in a stable society .

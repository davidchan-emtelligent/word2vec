injury is expected to become the second leading cause of death by 2020 [ 1 ] .
the initial evaluation of a critically injured polytrauma patient is a challenging task and every minute can make the difference between life and death .
it has been shown that mortality decreases as the time from injury to diagnosis and treatment is shortened [ 1 ] .
over the past few years , the assessment of trauma patients has evolved , due to the improved understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to morbidity and mortality in trauma , and this has led to the development of advanced trauma life support .
because hemorrhagic shock is the second leading cause of death after trauma , the optimal treatment for bleeding has become a major priority .
in their paper , v. jeger et al .
" the role of thromboelastography in multiple trauma " describe thrombelastography ( teg ) as a very useful tool in managing bleeding patients , and we suspect that this procedure will become a gold standard of resuscitation during the next decade .
since fluid resuscitation is one of the major tasks in the management and treatment of severely burned patients , the paper by m. stander et al .
" the emergency management and treatment of severe burns " is really significant , as it presents a simple guideline for the initial management of severe burns , as utilised by the south african burn society .
but what would treatment be without imaging ?
quick and cost - effective imaging has become one of the cornerstones of modern trauma management. r. kaewlai et al .
" blunt cardiac injury in trauma patients with thoracic aortic injury " and p. d. levy et al .
" micropower impulse radar : a novel technology for rapid , real - time detection of pneumothorax " present some very promising data on detecting injuries of the heart and lungs .
micropower impulse radar , for example , is a novel technology for the rapid detection of pneumothorax , with the power to simplify decision making in the prehospital sector as well as in the trauma bay and to reduce the burden of radiation for patients and staff .
since no technology is perfect and any 100 % sensitivity and specificity margin for diagnosing injuries is a myth , we focus on the importance of the followup of trauma patients and raise the awareness for even rare but potentially life - threatening complications .

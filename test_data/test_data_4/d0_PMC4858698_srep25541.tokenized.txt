however , signals controlling the developing epicardium and epicardial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in the normal and diseased adult heart are studied less rigorously .
here we investigated the role of angiogenic hormone , prokineticin - 2 and its receptor pkr1 in the epicardium of developing and adult heart .
genetic ablation of pkr1 in epicardium leads to partial embryonic and postnatal lethality with abnormal heart development .
cardiac developmental defects are manifested in the adult stage as ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction .
we discovered that pkr1 regulates epicardial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) for epicardial - derived progenitor cell ( epdc ) , formation .
this event affects at least three consequential steps during heart development : ( i ) epdc and cardiomyocyte proliferation involved in thickening of an outer compact ventricular chamber wall , ( ii ) rhythmicity , ( iii ) formation of coronary circulation .
in isolated embryonic epdcs , overexpression or activation of pkr1 alters cell morphology and emt markers via activating akt signaling .
lack of pkr1 signal in epicardium leads to defective heart development and underlies the origin of congenital heart disease in adult mice .
our mice provide genetic models for congenital dysfunction of the heart and should facilitate studies of both pathogenesis and therapy of cardiac disorders in humans .
congenital heart disease is the most common human malformation .
alterations in cardiac development may lead to a variety of congenital diseases .
the epicardium layer of epithelial cells covering the myocardial surface has emerged as physiologically relevant tissue in cardiac development .
one of the important developmental mechanism in the heart is epicardial - to - mesenchymal transformation ( emt ) 1 .
epicardium undergoes emt to form epicardial - derived progenitor cells ( epdcs ) that contribute to the development and maturation of many cardiac cell types2 .
therefore , identification of the factor that regulates of emt in epicardium is essential to understand the etiology of heart diseases .
prokineticin - 1 and 2 are potent angiogenic factors that use two g - protein coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) ; pkr1 and pkr23 .
prokineticin - 2 is the most potent agonist of these two receptors .
expression of prokineticin - 2 and pkr1 are increased in a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction4 and decreased in hearts of end state heart failure patients5 .
these observations implicate a central role for prokineticin - 2 / pkr1 signaling in myocardial development and coronary repair6 .
prokineticin - 2 via pkr1 induces coronary endothelial cell proliferation , migration , and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo7 .
activation or overexpression of pkr1 protects cardiomyocytes against hypoxic insult5 .
however , pkr2 is involved in endothelial cell fenestration and development of hypertrophy in the heart8 .
transient pkr1 gene transfer after coronary ligation in the mouse model of myocardial infarction reduces mortality and preserves heart function by promoting cardiac angiogenesis and cardiomyocyte survival5 .
transgenic mice specifically overexpressing pkr1 in cardiomyocytes ( utilizing the alpha - mhc promoter ) display increased neovascularization9 .
myocardial pkr1 signaling was shown to regulate epicardium - derived cell ( epdc ) differentiation in a paracrine manner to induce neovascularization in mouse heart9 .
cardiomyocytes overexpression of pkr1 up regulates prokineticin - 2 , its own ligand .
prokineticin - 2 then acts as a paracrine factor , promoting heterogeneous epdc differentiation into endothelial and smooth muscle cells ( smc ) .
these prokineticin - 2 effects were abolished in epdc derived from pkr1 - null mutant hearts , demonstrating pkr1 involvement9 .
in addition , prokineticin / pkr1 signaling reprograms adult epdcs in a cell autonomous way9 .
global loss of pkr1 impairs heart morphogenesis , leading to cardiomyopathy and cardiac dysfunction10 .
however , the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologies have not been reported yet11 .
in this study we investigated the effect of pkr1 deficiency in epicardial cells on heart function and development , focusing on the formation of epdcs by epicardial emt .
we used the gata5 ( g5 ) - cre12 and wt1gfp cre transgenic lines13 and generate pkr1 mutant lines .
since wt1 is expressed in epicardium14 , wt1gfp cre mice provide additional advantages to trace these progenitor cells in the heart .
we showed that loss of pkr1 in epicardium impaired emt events , affecting proliferation and survival of these cardiac progenitor cells , leading to developmental and functional defects in the heart .
our results designate pkr1 signaling as another angiogenic system involved in epicardial development via akt activation in modulating emt .
results verification of loss of pkr1 in heart of mutant lines loss of pkr1 in epicardium was achieved by interbreeding gata5 - cre ( pilarruiz - lozano , stanford university , stanford , ca , usa ) and wt1 - cregfp ( the jackson laboratory , bar harbor , me , usa ) transgenic mice with mice harboring a floxed pkr1 allele ( gata5cre x pkr1fl / fl or wt1cre x pkr1fl / fl ) .
examples of genotyping analyses are shown in fig. 1a , and primers sequences are given in table s1 ( supplementary material ) .
pkr1 protein ( green ) was absent from wt1 - positive epicardial cells , but it was present in myocardium of newborn pkr1g5 - / - hearts with diminished subepicardium ( fig. 1b ) .
accordingly , pkr1 levels were identical in the myocardium ( fig. 1c ) and in isolated cardiomyocytes of pkr1g5 - / - mice ( fig. 1d left histogram ) .
low level of beta - catenin expression in the pkr1g5 - / - neonatal hearts may be associated with defective emt during embryogenesis ( fig. 1d right histogram ) .
immunohistochemistry revealed severe loss of pkr1 in the epicardium ( fig. 1f upper ) despite of no modification of pkr1 expression in the endothelium ( fig. 1f middle ) and myocardium ( fig. 1f lower ) of pkr1wt1 - / - hearts at e15.5 dpc .
at e10.5 dpc , loss of epicardial pkr1 was evident only in the pkr1wt1 - / - hearts ( fig. 1g ) .
pkr1 protein ( green ) was also absent in the wt1 + ( nuclear - red ) epicardium of pkr1wt1 - / - hearts ( fig. 1h upper illustration ) .
wt1gfp + cells are lacked pkr1 transcript ( fig. 1h left ) , however normal pkr1 expression was found in the cardiomyocytes of the pkr1wt1 - / - hearts ( fig. 1h right ) .
although the epicardial - restricted gata5cre and wt1gfp / cre mice displayed ectopic cre expression in the endocardial / endothelial and myocardial cells of the developing heart15 , our data demonstrate that both g5 - cre and wt1 - cregfp efficiently removes pkr1 from the epicardium without significantly altering myocardial or endothelial pkr1 expression .
impaired heart functions in adult pkr1g5 - / - mice although pkr1g5 - / - mice were born at the expected mendelian ratio , 11 +/ - 2 % of these mice developed heart failure and postnatal premature lethality .
histological analyses showed that pkr1g5 - / - mutants ( 24 weeks old ) had thinner ventricular wall ( fig. 2a right ) , also reflected in a low heart weight to body weight ratio ( fig. 2a , histogram ) .
echocardiographic analyses revealed low ventricular mass and impaired ejection and shortening fractions in adult pkr1g5 - / - mice , demonstrating systolic and diastolic dysfunctions ( fig. 2b , table 2 in supplementary materials ) .
interestingly , isovolumetric contraction time ( ivct ) , defined as the interval between mitral valve closure and aortic valve opening , was prolonged , indicating an impairment of the initial left ventricular contractile phase ( table 2 , supplementary materials ) .
ecg analysis revealed signs of ischemia with an st - segment depression and negative t - waves in the mutants ( fig. 2c ) .
severe interstitial fibrosis ( blue ) detected by mallory 's tetrachrome staining on cryosectioned heart samples with increased collagen transcript levels was evident in adult mutant hearts ( fig. 2d ) .
ventricular hypoplasia and impaired function can be due to a marked caspase - 3 +/ mhc + cardiomyocyte loss due to increased apoptosis detected by tunel analyses in mutant hearts ( 20 +/ - 2 tunel + nuclei / 104 myocytes ) compared to control hearts ( 8 +/ - 1 tunel + nuclei / 104 myocytes ) ( fig. 2e ) .
a low level of succinate dehydrogenase ( sdh ) activity in the subepicardial area in pkr1g5 - / - hearts indicates low oxidative capacity of the mitochondria ( fig. 2f ) .
morphometric analysis of the dystrophin - stained heart tissues ( fig. 2g ) , and isolated cardiomyocytes , showed a significant increase in cell size in pkr1g5 - / - mice compared with controls ( fig. 2h ) .
in addition , significant increases in markers of myocardial hypertrophy such as beta - myosin heavy chain ( mhc ) , atrial natriuretic factor ( anf ) , and brain natriuretic peptide ( bnp ) were observed ( fig. 2i ) .
this data indicate that the viable cardiomyocytes in mutant hearts developed hypertrophy to compensate for functional defects .
thus , mutant mice developed ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction .
a less developed coronary network was evident in the adult pkr1g5 - / - heart with reduced number of branching points visualized by tail intravenous evans blue (% 0.5 ) injection ( fig. 2j ) .
in concert with these findings , pecam - 1 positive capillary number and alpha - sma positive coronary artery numbers were reduced ( supplemental material figure s1a ) .
survival rates of the mutant mice were dramatically reduced after coronary ligation , a mouse model of myocardial infarction ( supplemental material figure s1b ) .
cardiomyopathy seems to have resulted from a default in vasculogenesis and excessive cardiomyocyte death .
these data indicate that the lethality among the adult mutant mice is likely due to impaired heart functions .
hypoplastic heart with vascular defects in pkr1g5 - / - neonates mutant neonates displayed a pronounced reduction in cardiac size and weight ( fig. 3a ) .
the subepicardial space was diminished in pkr1g5 - / - mice , as shown by mallory staining of the cryosectioned hearts ( fig. 3b upper panel ) and em studies ( fig. 3b lower panel ) .
oil red o staining showed numerous small droplets of neutral lipids throughout the cytosol of pkr1g5 - / - cardiomyocytes ( fig. 3c ) .
in concert with this finding , extracted total lipid levels in mutant hearts were elevated ( fig. 3c histogram ) .
electron microscopic analyses demonstrated preserved cardiac cytoarchitecture , yet an abnormally high presence of cytosolic lipid droplets and mitochondria ( fig. 3d ) .
abnormal mitochondria and lipid accumulation in pkr1g5 - / - cardiomyocytes might account for the lower beating rate in response to dobutamine ( fig. 3e ) .
accompanying reductions in transcript levels of calcium handling genes ( phospholamban , serca na +/ ca ++ exchanger and ryanodine receptor ) reflected impaired cardiac contractility found in the mutants ( fig. 3f ) .
the neonatal pkr1g5 - / - mice had a less developed capillary network within the subepicardial layer of the dorsal wall of the ventricles , as shown by endothelial cell - specific pecam - 1 staining ( fig. 3g upper panels ) .
alpha - sma immunostaining demonstrated lower number of vessels in mutant hearts ( fig. 3g , lower panels ) .
these data indicate that these mutant mice have congenital heart diseases .
pkr1wt1 - / - embryos have embryonic lethality due to impaired proliferation and survival of gfp + cells next we generated a second epicardial specific pkr1 inactivation in mice ( w pkr1wt1 - / - ) by using wt1 - gfpcre transgenic mice to gain insight to the cellular and molecular mechanism of the phenotype .
we found that pkr1wt1 - / - mice suffer from a 15 +/ - 2 % lethality ( p < 0.05 , n = 90 ) at fetal stages ( between 12.5 and 16.5 dpc ) .
histological analysis of hearts from pkr1wt1 - / - embryos ( 14.5 dpc ) revealed a bifid apex , cardiac compact zone hypoplasia with reduced ventricular expansion , and septal defects .
dilation of the left atrium was also apparent ( fig. 4a , upper and middle panels ) .
at 14.5 dpc , in wild type embryos the vast majority of myocytes adjacent to the epicardium remained relatively undifferentiated .
hence subepicardial cardiomyocytes rarely contained essential components of contractile myocytes , such as sarcomeres , ( the contractile unit found in differentiated myocardial cells ) , intercalated disks or sarcoplasmic reticulum in the control hearts ( fig. 4b ) .
in pkr1wt1 - / - mutants , about 50 % of these subepicardial cells exhibited premature differentiation , hence contained striated myofibrils , displaying on average 10 consecutive sarcomeres with " z " bands .
increased active - caspase - 3 staining ( gfp +) in the cytoplasm ( showing increased apoptosis ) was accompanied by a reduction of brdu - positive proliferating cells in the pkr1wt1 - / - hearts ( fig. 4c ) .
interestingly , in control embryos the proliferating wt1 +/ ki67 + cells were found not only in a subset of epicardial but also in subepicardial mesenchyme ( fig. 4d ) .
this expansion of subepicardial mesenchyme is suggestive of normal emt process16 .
in mutant hearts , although the number of cells was decreased , a few subepicardial cells stained with both wt1 and ki67 ( figure s2a ) , indicating impaired emt in mutant epicardium .
these data clearly show that loss of pkr1 in epicardium effectively impairs proliferation and survival in epicardial progenitor cells .
in concert with these in vivo findings , prokineticin - 2 has also promoted proliferation and survival in isolated epdcs that was blocked by pi3k / akt inhibitor ly 40092 ( figure s2b - d ) .
in pkr1wt1 - / - hearts , numbers of mhc +/ ki67 + cardiomyocytes were also reduced ( fig. 4e ) , indicating that epicardial - pkr1 signaling is important for cardiomyocyte proliferation during embryogenesis .
next , we compared the proliferation rate of cardiomyocytes ( wild type ) when they cultured in the conditioned media of epicardial cells derived from control or mutant hearts .
cardiomyocyte growing rate was significantly lower in the conditioned media of the mutant epdcs , showing lack of epicardial - derived proliferative signaling in mutant hearts ( supplemental material figure s3a ) .
all together these data clearly show that cardiomyocyte phenotype is resulted from lack of epicardial paracrine signal due to loss of pkr1 in epicardium .
consequently , numbers of pecam - 1 positive capillaries ( supplemental material figure s3b ) and alpha - sma positive coronary arteries ( figure s3c ) were reduced in pkr1wt1 - / - hearts .
abnormal coronary artery development in pkr1wt1 - / - hearts was also demonstrated with evans blue staining ( figure s3d ) .
these data clearly show that loss of pkr1 in the epicardium results in impaired proliferation and survival of epdcs cells , affecting cardiomyocyte proliferation and vascular formations .
pkr1wt1 - / - embryos have deregulated emt in the heart we next investigated contribution of emt in formation of wt1 + cells in the hearts of mutant embryos .
to elucidate the network of interactions between emt regulatory factors , we first assessed the expression of the following transcriptional factors known to promote emt17 : beta - catenin , snai1 and c - myc , ( a beta - catenin regulated gene ) as well as other genes associated with the mesenchymal state , vimentin ( vim1 ) or the epithelial state , e - cadherin in the hearts of mutant and control embryos of day of 16.5 .
while expressions of epicardial genes - such as wt1 and tbx18 - were unaffected , the expressions of beta - catenin , vim1 , snai1 , and c - myc in pkr1wt1 - / - heart were consistently and significantly lower compare to controls ( fig. 5a ) .
similarly , level of beta - catenin protein that is a key player in emt was reduced in pkr1wt1 - / - hearts detected by western blot analyses and demonstrated by the beta - catenin immunostaining ( fig. 5b and histogram ) .
as emt involves cytoskeletal reorganization , we tested whether gain off function or activation of pkr1 may have any effect on actin cytoskeleton arrangement , thereby causing alteration of cell morphology ( e.g. , epithelial or mesenchymal - like phenotype ) .
we isolated primary gfp + cells from wt1cregfp embryonic hearts , overexpressed pkr1 by adenovirus carrying pkr1 cdna ( 5moi ) 5 , and analyzed for the distribution of actin fibers by immunofluorescence of phalloidin .
since pkr1 has an intrinsic activity to promote biological activity in the absence of its ligand7 , pkr1 overexpressing epicardial cells ( pkr1 - epdcs ) had significant changes in f - actin organization seen as a strong increase in phalloidin fluorescence ( mesenchymal phenotype ) ( fig. 5c ) .
consistently , the overexpression of pkr1 in embryonic epicardial cells increased all the emt markers ( except e - cadherine ) compared to adv - control infected cells ( fig. 5d ) .
a reduced e - cadherine level could be consequences of increased levels of twist and snai2 that repress e - cadherine transcript , thus facilitating emt18 .
we also examined the emt events in the epicardial cells of pkr1wt1 - / - . no f - actin organization was observed in phalloidin stained pkr1 deficient cells upon prokineticin - 2 treatment , indicating that pkr1 deficient cells are not able to undergo mesenchymal transition ( fig. 5e left panel ) .
however , the emt was evident in the control epicardial cells upon prokineticin - 2 treatment where the cell adhesion was altered within 1 h as detected by zo - 1 , a junctional protein , internalization ( 5e right panel ) .
next we cultured epicardial explants of pkr1g5 - / - embryos to see whether emt deficiency exist in this mutant line , by carrying out wound - healing assay .
indeed , the migrating cell number was increased in the control epicardial cells upon prokineticin - 2 treatment for 48 h that was abolished by akt inhibitor ly294002 ( fig. 5f ) .
however , pkr1g5 - / - mutant cells cannot migrate in response to prokineticin - 2 .
( fig. 5f lower panel ) .
next we investigated involvement of akt in the pkr1 - mediated emt signaling .
prokineticin - 2 treatment of the epicardial cells induced a transition from cuboidal morphology to a spindle - like , elongated shape ( fig. 6a ) .
the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( pi3k )/ akt inhibitor ly294002 ( 10 mu m ) inhibited emt ( fig. 6a,c histogram ) .
fk - 506 ( 10 mu m ) an inhibitor of nuclear factor of activated t cells ( nfatc3 ) , had no effect on prokineticin - 2 - mediated cellular changes .
consistently , prokineticin - 2 did not persistently alter nfatc3 activation by nuclear accumulation ( fig. 6b lower , and c right histogram ) .
moreover , prokineticin - 2 activated akt by phosphorylating it in wt1 + epicardial cells that was not seen in the pkr1 deficient epicardial cells ( fig. 6d and left histogram ) .
pkr1wt1 - / - hearts had also lower levels of phosphorylated akt compared to control hearts ( fig. 5e,f histogram ) , establishing the contribution of the pi3k / akt axis for the pkr1 - mediated emt .
discussion in this study we provide evidence for the critical role of epicardial - pkr1 signaling in cardiac development , and how defective epicardial signaling manifests in forms of congenital heart diseases in adult heart , focusing on the emt programming process ( fig. 7 ) .
using two epicardial - cre lineages , we showed in vivo that loss of epicardial pkr1 leads to reduce ventricular expansion and septal defects during embryogenesis and severe hypoplasia and ischemic cardiomyopathy at postnatal stages .
although both mutant hearts had impaired emt that counts for low epdcs numbers and their phenotypes , the differences between the two strains ( embryonic versus neonatal lethality , hypoplastic ventricle versus hypotrophic atrium , premature formation of z - bands in the subepicardium in the wt1 cre but not in the gata5 cre line ) can be results of some other as yet unidentified function for this pathway .
alternatively , differences in the timing and expression of their cre14 can explain some phenotypical differences between the two strains .
loss of pkr1 in epicardium of both strains reduces epicardial cell proliferation , migration and adhesion , leading to impaired expansion of subepicardial mesenchyme , suggestive of impaired emt19 .
emt is also driven by changes in gene expression and cell morphology .
we showed in vitro that epicardial cells lose their cell polarity and cell - cell adhesion , and gain migratory properties to become mesenchymal progenitor cells upon prokineticin - 2 treatment .
however , both pkr1g5 - / - and pkr1wt1 - / - epicardial cells had impaired emt process in response to prokineticin - 2 , indicating pkr1 involvement .
pkr1 activation or overexpression induced changes in cell morphology , actin cytoskeleton remodeling , and gene expression profile via activating akt signaling .
activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) and akt has been shown to promote emt in developing heart2021 .
indeed , inhibition of pi3k / akt signaling represses epicardial emt in mice22 .
similarly , prokineticin - 2 dramatically enhances akt phosphorylation in epicardial cells .
inhibition of akt phosphorylation blocks the formation of mesenchymal - like cell morphology and migration of the cells .
phosphorylated - akt positive cell number and protein levels were completely diminished in pkr1 deficient epicardial cells and hearts .
in concert , pkr1 signaling has been shown to activate akt via gq protein in cardimyocytes to protect these cells against apoptosis5 .
in the endothelial cells pkr1 uses both erk and akt signaling pathway to induce proliferation , migration , and angiogenesis7 .
gq coupled receptors can promote plc activity and intracellular calcium release .
the calcium signaling pathway is involved in activation of calcineurin that dephosphorylates the nfat transcription factor , triggering nfat proteins to translocate into the nucleus to control target gene expression23 .
although nfatc3 was slightly accumulated in the nucleus only 10 min after prokineticin - 2 treatment of the epicardial cells , nfat inhibitor had no effect on emt events , eliminating the implication of nfat in regulation of emt by prokineticin / pkr1 system .
all together our data suggest that pkr1 stimulates pi3 / akt for emt thereby inducing the epdc formation .
conditional rxra13 , raldh224 or beta - catenin12 inactivation in epicardial - derived cells utilizing gata5 cre mice causes epicardial detachment and reduction of the adjacent myocardium compact zone , impairing myocardial growth .
this can be due to impaired emt and the lack of epicardial - derived proliferative signaling12 .
these defects are similar to the ones in our pkr1 mice models .
moreover , prokineticin - 2 also promoted proliferation and survival in wt1 + epdcs in a cell - autonomous manner .
previously , we have shown in vitro that prokineticin - 2 / pkr1 signaling induces adult epdc proliferation and differentiation into vasculogenic cell type9 .
impaired vasculogenesis in the epicardial - specific pkr1 mutant mice hearts could be due to impaired epdc proliferation as well as a defective epdc differentiation into vasculogenic cell type .
lack of beta - catenin in epicardium induces abnormal coronary vessel development1216 .
downregulation of beta - catenin in pkr1wt1 - / - epicardium likely accounted for phenotypic similarity of epicardial loss of function of beta - catenin and pkr1 .
epdcs have been also shown to provide the cellular substrates for cardiomyocyte proliferation25 .
our studies uncovered a unique role of epicardium on regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation , contractile performance , rhythmicity , as well as metabolism .
rhythmicity of pkr1g5 - / - neonatal cardiomyocytes was lower both at the baseline and upon dobutamine - induced stress condition .
moreover , pkr1g5 - / - cardiomyocytes had lower calcium handling gene expressions and severe lipid deposition that resulted in impaired contractile performance .
the abnormal cardiomyocyte proliferation , contractility and lipid accumulation in mutant hearts could be due to ( i ) lack of epicardial paracrine factors in mutant hearts , ( ii ) differentiation of epdcs into adipocytes26 .
lack of pkr1 in epdcs may promote differentiation of epdcs into adipocytes , as previously shown for preadipocytes that activation of pkr1 suppress adipogenesis27 .
these two phenomena are currently under the investigation in our laboratory .
due to developmental defects , impaired neonatal heart regenerative capacity and later lipotoxic ischemic cardiomyopathy , adult pkr1g5 - / - mice exhibited functional impairments and a few of them could survive after experimental myocardial infarction ( mi ) .
previously , we have also shown that transient gene therapy with pkr1 enhances angiogenesis and decreases cardiomyocyte apoptosis after mi5 .
moreover , pkr1 gene therapy preserves myocardial function by inducing wt1 - positive progenitor cell expansion and migration4 .
in addition , a non - peptide agonist for pkr1 has recently been shown to improve heart function and survival rate after mi. this agonist promotes wt1 + cell proliferation and migration and inhibits cardiomyocyte death28 .
taken together , these data suggest that pkr1 signaling may influence cardiac remodeling through modulating epdc activation by emt and cardiomyocyte homeostasis by paracrine signaling in the developing and injured heart .
pkr1 is expressed in epicardium , cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells in the heart16 .
the total pkr1 knockout mice ( pkr1null mice ) also show disorders of heart910 .
however , lack of embryonic lethality in pkr1null mice could be partially due to transient angiogenic gene redundancy in the embryos .
for example , perturbation of capillary angiogenesis in the hearts of neonatal pkr1null mice was partially restored at the adult stage via upregulation of hypoxia - inducible factor - 1 and proangiogenic factors ( e.g. vegf ) due to severe hypoxia .
this resulted in reactivation of capillary formation in heart at the expense of the epicardial capillary networks .
pkr1null mice had also cardiomyocyte contractile defects and apoptosis partially due to lack of pkr1 signaling in cardiomyocytes ( autonomous effect of pkr1 ) .
it is clear that pkr1 in the epicardium controls cell autonomous and paracrine signaling in developing hearts .
paracrine factors released from epicardial cells by pkr1 signaling are currently under investigation in our laboratories .
although myocardially expressed pkr1 induced coronary vessel formation by a paracrine process9 , here we showed a reciprocal interaction between epicardium and cardiomyocyte via pkr1 signaling .
in the other hand , cell autonomous pkr1 signaling in epicardium is indispensable for proper epdc and myocardial development and function .
finally , our findings are the first to show that epicardial - pkr1 is a key player for emt process during heart development .
our findings should facilitate development of new strategies for treatment of congenital heart diseases .

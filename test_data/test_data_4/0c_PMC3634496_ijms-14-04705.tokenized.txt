hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infects approximately 3 % of the world 's population .
currently licensed treatment of hcv chronic infection with pegylated - interferon - alpha and ribavirin , is not fully effective against all hcv genotypes and is associated to severe side effects .
thus , development of novel therapeutics and identification of new targets for treatment of hcv infection is necessary .
current opinion is orienting to target antiviral drug discovery to the host cell pathways on which the virus relies , instead of against viral structures .
many intracellular signaling pathways manipulated by hcv for its own replication are finely regulated by the oxido - reductive ( redox ) state of the host cell .
at the same time , hcv induces oxidative stress that has been found to affect both virus replication as well as progression and severity of hcv infection .
a dual role , positive or negative , for the host cell oxidized conditions on hcv replication has been reported so far .
this review examines current information about the effect of oxidative stress on hcv life cycle and the main redox - regulated intracellular pathways activated during hcv infection and involved in its replication .
hcv jfh - 1 antioxidants oxidative stress gsh mapk akt 1 .
introduction according to evaluations of the world health organization ( who ) , hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) currently infects at least 130 million people worldwide , which is about 3 % of the global population [ 1 ] .
following acute hcv infection , a chronic state is established in as many as 80 % of infected individuals .
although many subjects carrying the virus remain asymptomatic , chronicity is often accompanied by altered liver function and progressive liver disease that culminates in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in up to 20 % of chronically infected individuals [ 2 ] .
hcv is a positive - sense single stranded rna virus of the flaviviridae family .
the hcv genome is about 9.6 kb in length and consists of the 5 ' untranslated region ( utr ) , the structural ( core , e1 and e2 ) and non - structural ( p7 , ns2 , ns3 , ns4 a / b , ns5 a / b ) proteins and the 3 ' utr .
hcv binds to the cd81 and / or sr - bi receptors , enters the cell through clathrin - mediated endocytosis and is uncoated , releasing the rna genome into the cytoplasm .
the positive - sense rna first serves as a messenger rna for translation of a single large polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved , by host and viral peptidases , to generate individual proteins .
subsequently , hcv rna acts as a template for viral genome replication , mediated by virus encoded rna - dependent rna polymerase , ns5b , in cooperation with ns5a and other viral proteins .
the virus replication complex is localized to the membranous web that is formed by modified membranes of the er and golgi .
after encapsidation of the viral genome , virions are exported through the host secretory pathway .
for recent reviews on the hcv life cycle see [ 3,4 ] .
current therapy of chronic hepatitis c is based on a combination of peg - interferon ( peg - ifn ) - alpha and ribavirin .
this combination therapy is not fully effective , as it achieves a sustained virological response ( svr ) in less than half of treated patients with hcv genotype 1 and about 80 % of those with genotype 2 , and causes severe side effects [ 5 - 7 ] .
recent approval , in europe and in the united states , of the two new drugs targeting the hcv protease ( telaprevir and boceprevir ) produced an increased svr rate to 70 % - 80 % in triple combination therapy with peg - ifn - alpha and ribavirin [ 8 ] .
however triple combination treatment has limitations in partial non - responders and null responders to a prior course of peg - ifn - alpha and ribavirin [ 9 - 12 ] and has more severe side effects. from the above , a pressing need exists for the development of new and alternative therapeutic strategies to combat hcv infection .
to circumvent the onset of drug resistance , a major obstacle to therapeutic success , it seems to be particularly important to approach viral infection therapy by considering the interactions between virus and host cells .
in fact , current opinion is to target antiviral drug discovery to the host cell pathways on which the virus relies , instead of against viral structures , in order to decrease the likelihood of acquiring drug resistance [ 13,14 ] .
it is known that many cellular proteins involved in a wide range of signaling pathways that are manipulated by hcv , to promote its own replication [ 15 - 18 ] , are influenced by the intracellular redox state [ 19 - 21 ] .
the redox state of a cell results from an equilibrium between the production of reactive oxygen / nitrogen species ( ros / rns ) and the anti - oxidative defenses ( antioxidant molecules and enzymes ) [ 21 ] .
an imbalance towards pro - oxidative conditions is referred to as oxidative stress .
the intracellular thiols are an important class of antioxidant molecules , with glutathione ( gsh ) being the most abundant .
in cells , gsh can be free or bound to proteins .
free gsh exists mainly in its reduced form ( gsh ) , which can be transformed to the oxidized gluthatione ( gssg ) during oxidative stress and it can be reverted to the reduced form by the enzyme gsh reductase .
the ratio between gsh / gssg is considered an index of the antioxidant capacity of the cell [ 22 ] .
the reduced form of glutathione is an important radical scavenger that directly neutralizes a variety of reactive molecules ( such as superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals ) [ 23 ] .
in addition to its role as a redox buffer , gsh can form mixed disulfides ( gssr ) with protein thiols ( s - glutathionylation ) , thus protecting cysteine residues of proteins from irreversible oxidation events .
moreover , s - glutathionylation may alter protein function and is actually considered to be involved in signal transduction [ 24,25 ] .
it has been demonstrated that infections by several viruses , including hcv , are frequently characterized by host - cell redox changes , characteristic of oxidative stress , that affect the efficacy of viral replication [ 26 - 33 ] .
this review presents a summary of the current knowledge about redox regulation of hcv life cycle and discusses some of main redox regulated intracellular pathways activated during hcv infection and involved in its replication .
2. hcv infection induces oxidative stress increased oxidative stress is a hallmark of hcv infection ( reviewed in [ 28,29,33 ]) .
clinical studies have shown that hcv patients have elevated levels of reactive aldehydes produced by lipid peroxidation , such as malondialdehyde and 4 - hydroxy - 2 - nonenal , in their serum , peripheral blood mononuclear cells and liver [ 34,35 ] .
liver levels of 8 - hydroxydeoxyguanosine , a marker of oxidative damage , are also elevated [ 34,36 ] .
furthermore , an increased glutathione turnover in the liver , blood and lymphatic system has been suggested by the observation of decreased ratio between gsh / gssg [ 34,37 - 39 ] .
usually , viruses induce an inflammatory response at the site of infection , where release of ros by immune cells acts as non - specific toxins , kills pathogens and injuries adjacent cells .
in the case of persistent infections , chronic inflammation results in overwhelming production of ros that induces tissues damage and predispose to disease induction [ 40 ] .
however , although inflammation is an important source of ros during chronic infection [ 41,42 ] , hcv infected patients with minimum or no liver disease showed markers of oxidative stress [ 43 ] and hcv transgenic mice exhibited signs of increased oxidative damage in the absence of inflammation [ 44 ] .
these evidences suggest that hcv may directly promote oxidative stress in hepatocytes ( figure 1 ) .
actually , numerous in vitro studies have shown that not only hcv replication , but also expression of the hcv structural and non - structural proteins , directly act as inducers of oxidative stress , mainly through mitochondrial dysfunction of hepatocytes and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress [ 45 - 52 ] .
in particular , direct interaction of the structural hcv core protein with mitochondria decreases the mitochondrial nadph levels , reduces the activity of the electron transport complex i and increases generation of ros [ 45 - 47 ] ; the non - structural proteins ns5a [ 49,50 ] , ns4b [ 50 ] and the structural glycoproteins e1 and e2 [ 51 ] induce ros production by er stress .
recently , it has been demonstrated that hepatocyte nad ( p ) h oxidase ( nox ) proteins 1 and 4 represent another prominent source of ros during hcv infection [ 53,54 ] , as they were found significantly elevated both in hcv infected cells and in the liver of hcv - infected patients [ 53 ] .
in addition , hcv replication may induce impairment of host cell antioxidant defenses [ 55 - 58 ] , and directly alter the endogenous levels of gsh [ 53,56,59 ] ( table 1 ) .
although in vivo studies reported a decreased hepatic gsh content in hcv chronically infected patients [ 34,38,40 ] , however studies in vitro showed conflicting results about the effect of hcv on intracellular gsh as well as on the enzymes regulating gsh homeostasis [ 55,60 - 62 ] .
in this regard , roe and collaborators [ 59 ] reported a significant raise of gssg in hcv infected cells ; conversely , increased gsh concentration was demonstrated by de mochel et al .
[ 53 ] using same in vitro infection system .
analogous contradiction has been described for the effect of hcv on the activity of nf - e2 - related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) , a central regulator of the enzymes of glutathione homeostasis [ 63,64 ] .
recently , two studies , performed by burdette et al .
[ 60 ] and ivanov et al .
[ 61 ] reported activation of nrf2 pathway , respectively in hcv infected huh - 7 cells and in cells expressing the individual viral proteins .
conversely , carvajal - yepes and collaborators [ 62 ] demonstrated suppression of this pathway upon transfection of cells with hcv clones .
the apparently disparate effects on gsh by hcv may be due to different experimental systems used ( hcv transfected versus infected cell cultures ) .
however , it has to be considered that viruses producing chronic infections , such as hiv and hcv , cause significant changes of gsh levels only after chronic infection is well established [ 27,65 ] .
so , it has been proposed [ 61 ] that data by burdette et al .
[ 60 ] and by ivanov et al .
[ 61 ] may be representative of the acute phase of hcv infection , when the cells enhance the expression of antioxidant genes to protect themselves against the virus induced oxidative stress .
in contrast , data from the study of carvajal - yepes [ 62 ] could be related to chronic virus infection .
further studies about the changes of gsh levels during hcv acute and chronic infections are required to clarify this point .
3. oxidative stress affects hcv replication hcv related oxidative stress is involved in the development of liver injury , and in the progression of liver disease towards fibrosis , cirrhosis and hcc [ 28,29,66,67 ] .
therefore , antioxidants have been proposed as new potential treatment of hcv patients .
for example , in a phase i clinical trial testing a combination of seven different antioxidants , 44 % of the patients had normalization of liver enzymes levels and 36.1 % of the treated patients had histological improvement [ 68 ] .
alongside this positive effect of the anti - oxidants , however , it remains unclear how modulation of oxidative stress can affect hcv replication .
in general , treatment with drugs that amplify the effects of endogenous ros , generated during normal cellular metabolism or in response to hcv , has suppressive effect on hcv replication .
using replicon cells ( that are human hepatoma cell lines constitutively replicating hcv rna but not producing infectious virus particles ) , choi and collaborators found that h2o2 and t - butylhydroperoxide ( t - booh ) , which generates low levels of intracellular ros , reduced hcv rna by a mechanism involving the disruption of hcv replication complex on cell membranes [ 69,70 ] .
similar suppression of intracellular hcv was obtained upon ros induction with glucose oxidase ( go ) transfection in cell lines [ 71 ] .
in addition , modulation of intracellular glutathione , by arsenic trioxide or by bso , negatively affected hcv replication in vitro , either in replicon cells as well as in cells infected with hcv infectious clone ( jfh1 - infected cells ) [ 71,72 ] .
according to the above - reported negative effect of oxidative stress on hcv in vitro , some anti - oxidants ( such as vitamins a , vitamin e and resveratrol ) have been shown to enhance hcv replication in replicon model , with yet unknown mechanisms [ 73,74 ] .
on the other side , opposite effect of some antioxidant treatments on hcv has also been reported .
for examples , n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) [ 75 ] , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( pdtc ) [ 76,77 ] , sylimarin [ 78,79 ] , naringerin [ 80 - 82 ] , quercetin [ 82,83 ] , curcumin [ 84 ] and also the acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) [ 77 ] , have been found to decrease hcv replication and hcv proteins level in vitro .
in addition , transient transfection of the anti - oxidant enzyme , mn - superoxide dismutase , in replicon cells lowered viral replication [ 76 ] .
the steps in virus life cycle targeted by these antioxidants and the mechanisms related to their action are mostly unknown , although in some cases they have been described .
as examples , pdtc is reported to act through inhibition of mapk pathways [ 76 ] ; sylimarin inhibits virus entry and infectious virions production into culture supernatants through the inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( mtp ) activity and apolipoprotein b secretion [ 78 ] ; naringerin blocks virus assembly , partly by the activation of pparalpha , and consequent decrease in vldl production [ 80 ] .
few clinical studies describing the effect of antioxidant supplementation on hcv titer are available and have yielded so far inconsistent results [ 68,85,86 ] .
this lack of a clear correlation between oxidative stress and hcv replication remains an open question and may in part be explained by the fact that the same antioxidant molecules can display pro - or anti - oxidant functions , depending on their own oxidative status , which in turn reflects the specific redox potential of the microenvironment [ 87,88 ] .
in support of these considerations , wang and collaborators found that pre - treatment of mice with nac , a gsh precursor , prevents liver from acute ethanol - induced damage , via counteracting ethanol - induced oxidative stress ; whereas , when administered after ethanol , nac behaves as a pro - oxidant and exacerbates acute ethanol - induced liver damage [ 89 ] .
furthermore , we have shown that resveratrol ( rv ) can decrease gsh in a different virus and cell system , thus functioning as oxidant molecule [ 90 ] .
this fact has been explained considering that , although rv can quench reactive free radicals by donating hydrogen atoms , this process generates also phenoxyl radicals that can oxidize gsh to gs. .
moreover , oxidation of the rv - phenoxyl radical produces an rv - quinone form , which can alkylate gsh , further diminishing the intracellular concentrations of free gsh [ 91 ] .
a similar behaviour has been shown by vitamin e ( tocopherol ) , a chain - breaking antioxidants that interferes with radical chain propagation by trapping radicals .
during its metabolism , vitamin e is converted into tocopheroxyl radical with low reactivity that needs to be removed by a secondary antioxidant , such as ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) .
if the removal of tocopheroxyl radical by a secondary antioxidant is delayed , it may promote lipid peroxidation , functioning as pro - oxidant [ 92 ] .
therefore antioxidants are considered intriguing molecules to be used as antivirals .
however most of the studies so far available , evaluate the antiviral potential of antioxidant molecules , without concurrent measure of their effect on the cellular redox state , which could be the reason behind reported controversies in literature .
4. redox - regulated signaling pathways : mapk and pi3k / akt signaling pathways are critical controllers of hcv replication an abundance of scientific literature exists demonstrating that oxidative stress influences several signaling pathways [ 25,93 - 95 ] , among which the two mostly affected , mapk ( mitogen activated protein kinase ) and pi3k / akt pathways , have a pivotal role on replication of several viruses , such as influenza a virus [ 96 - 98 ] , hiv [ 99 ] , human cytomegalovirus [ 100 ] , varicella - zoster [ 101 ] and also hcv [ 15,17 ] .
map kinases ( comprising the three best characterized members erk , jnk and p38 mapk ) and akt are activated by general induction of intracellular ros [ 93,94,102 ] and are inhibited by the antioxidants [ 17,76,103 ] .
moreover , exposure of cells to exogenous h2o2 , that mimic oxidative stress , also leads to activation of mapk and pi3k / akt pathways in multiple cell types ( vascular smooth muscle cell , cardiac myocytes , a431 cell , cho cell line , hepatocytes ) [ 94,104 - 109 ] .
different mechanisms have been proposed for activation of the two pathways in response to ros [ 19,25,93 - 95 ] ( figure 1 ) .
in normal redox conditions , thioredoxin ( trx ) association with ask1 , the makkk for jnk and p38 , maintains the pathways inactive [ 110,111 ] ; upon oxidative stress thiol modification of trx , promotes its dissociation from ask1 [ 93,94 ] thus activating p38 and jnk [ 112 ] .
a second proposed mechanism involves ros induced oligomerization of glutathione - s - transferase pi ( gstp ) , resulting in its dissociation from the complex with jnk and the subsequent activation of the pathway [ 113 ] .
a further mechanism for activation of mapk and akt is by degrading the protein tyrosine phosphatases , ptpases , that maintain the pathways in inactive state [ 19,25 ] .
an example of this latter is oxidation and consequent inactivation of pten , a negative regulator of akt that results in pi3k / akt activation [ 114,115 ] .
it is known that during its life cycle , hcv activates mapk and akt pathways that have a role in the pathogenesis of inflammation , fibrosis , hcc [ 116 - 120 ] and in viral immune evasion strategies occurring during hcv infection [ 17,121 ]. with regard to the role of mapk cascades in hcv replication , virus binding to the cd81 receptor has been shown to activate the raf / mek / erk pathway that was necessary for post - entry events [ 122 ] .
consistently , it has recently been proposed that the blockade of erk cascade with the inhibitor of mek 1 / 2 ( u0126 ) prevents hcv assembly and virion release [ 16,123 ] .
furthermore , the inhibitors of jnk and p38mapk ( sp600125 and sb203580 respectively ) blocked hcv replication in replicon systems , suggesting that these kinases are tightly involved in positive control of hcv life cycle [ 76 ] .
however , some authors suggested a negative role of erk1 / 2 pathway on hcv in vitro , as activation of this pathway was shown to suppress viral replication in replicon system , whereas its inhibition promoted hcv replication [ 124 - 126 ] .
the discrepancies on the effects of the diverse cascades of the mapk pathway ( erk , jnk and p38 ) on hcv replication , are probably due to the different in vitro system used by the authors , therefore further research would need to elucidate this issue. with regard to the role of pi3k / akt pathway several reports have shown that it is activated by hcv [ 15,119,120 ] and that this event is critical for viral replication , as suggested by studies with small interfering rna ( sirna ) [ 127 ] or compounds that specifically block akt activity [ 18,84,127 ] .
among these latter , triciribine , that blocks akt activity without affecting its upstream activators , was found to inhibit both basal hcv replication , as well as that enhanced by epithelial growth factor ( egf ) [ 127 ] .
conversely , little is known about the steps of hcv replication cycle influenced by pi3k / akt .
recently , liu et al. [ 18 ] demonstrated that hcv rapidly and transiently activated akt , to enhance its entry into the cells , via the interaction between hcv e2 envelope protein and its co - receptors , cd81 and claudin - 1 .
interestingly , pi3k / akt pathway positively affects hcv replication by modulating lipid metabolism ; the mechanisms involve enhanced expression of srebp - 1 ( sterol regulatory element binding protein - 1 ) [ 84 ] , an important transcription factor of lipogenic gene expression , and inhibition of the ampk ( amp - activated protein kinase ) activity [ 128 ] , that results in stimulation of cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis .
increasing evidences show that hcv is critically dependent on cellular lipids throughout its life cycle [ 4,129,130 ] .
in fact viral rna replication complexes localize to lipid rafts ( membranous structures derived from the er ) rich in sphingomyelin and cholesterol [ 131 ] ; moreover a crucial role for lipid droplets ( lds ) in hcv assembly has also been demonstrated [ 132 ] .
on the basis of all the above reported data it could be reasonably speculated that pi3k / akt pathway , through modulation of hepatic lipid metabolism , could have a role both in early and late stages of hcv life cycle .
however , further investigations would need to disclose the exact steps of hcv life cycle influenced by akt pathway .
5. conclusions although hcv induces oxidative stress in host cells , all current revised literature points to a dual role of the host cell oxidized conditions on hcv replication .
several studies are in favor of a positive control of hcv replication by oxidative stress ; however , it cannot be ruled out that virus induced oxidative stress can negatively modulate its own replication .
this could be a mechanism to control the interaction at equilibrium between virus and host cell , which is the basis for establishment of chronicity .
although much has yet to be disclosed , the redox - mediated host cell mechanisms so far identified , together with those that will be further recognized , could uncover new effective approaches for hcv treatment .

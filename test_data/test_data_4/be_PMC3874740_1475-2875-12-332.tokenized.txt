background drug combination therapy is the frontline of malaria treatment .
there is an ever - accelerating need for new , efficacious combination therapies active against drug resistant malaria .
proven drugs already in the treatment pipeline , such as the quinolines , are important components of current combination therapy and also present an attractive test bank for rapid development of new concepts .
methods the efficacy of several drug combinations versus chloroquine - sensitive and chloroquine - resistant strains was measured using both cytostatic and cytocidal potency assays .
conclusions these screens identify quinoline and non - quinoline pairs that exhibit synergy , additivity , or antagonism using the fixed - ratio isobologram method and find tafenoquine - methylene blue combination to be the most synergistic .
also , interestingly , for selected pairs , additivity , synergy , or antagonism defined by quantifying ic50 ( cytostatic potency ) does not necessarily predict similar behaviour when potency is defined by ld50 ( cytocidal potency ) .
these data further support an evolving new model for quinoline anti - malarials , wherein haem and haemozoin are the principle target for cytostatic activity , but may not be the only target relevant for cytocidal activity .
isobologram combination therapy quinoline cytocidal p. falciparum background malaria remains a very serious threat to global health , with 300 - 500 million clinical cases and nearly 1 million deaths annually [ 1 ] .
given the growing spread of resistance to current anti - malarial drugs and lack of an effective vaccine [ 1 - 4 ] , development of novel , cost - effective , and efficacious drugs is of utmost importance .
decades of use of drugs such as chloroquine ( cq ) have rendered several cost - effective quinoline monotherapies ineffective in various malaria endemic regions .
for these reasons and others , the who currently recommends combination therapies , particularly artemisinin ( art ) - based combination therapy ( act ) , as first - line treatment for uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum [ 5 ] .
currently valuable act consists of art or derivatives , such as dihydroartemisinin , artemether , and artesunate , in combination with longer half - life quinolines , such as amodiaquine ( aq ) , mefloquine ( mq ) , or quinine ( qn ) , antibiotics such as doxycycline and clindamycin , or the blood schizonticide lumefantrine [ 2,4,5 ] .
addition of a single dose of the 8 - aminoquinoline primaquine ( pq ) to act is also recommended given its transmission blocking and gametocytocidal properties [ 5 - 7 ] .
pq was initially developed as a safer and more effective 8 - aminoquinoline alternative to plasmoquine , and is the only member of that drug class currently in use [ 6,7 ] , although clinical trials with the related drug tafenoquine ( tq ) are ongoing .
pq exhibits asexual stage activity against plasmodium vivax [ 8 ] , kills hypnozoites of p. vivax and plasmodium ovale [ 9,10 ] , and is active against late - stage gametocytes of p. falciparum [ 6,7,11 - 13 ] .
studies have consistently shown that pq can block transmission prior to the number of gametocytes being reduced [ 14 - 16 ] .
pq has poor growth inhibitory activity against intraerythrocytic stages of p. falciparum [ 17,18 ] , likely owing to poor inhibition of haemozoin ( hz ) formation in vitro [ 19 - 23 ] and an inability to bind ferriprotoporphyrin ix ( fpix ) haem in solution [ 20 ] .
use of pq is limited by short plasma half - life and toxicity , principally haemolysis in patients with x - linked glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ) deficiency [ 6,7 ] , which varies between 3 % and 30 % in endemic areas [ 24 ] .
recent evidence has suggested that risk of pq administration in high g6pd - deficient populations might be ameliorated by lower dosing , without loss of gametocytocidal potency [ 25,26 ] , which might be due to pq rapidly metabolizing to carboxypq , with plasma concentrations of the metabolite 10 - fold greater than pq 4 h post - dosing [ 27 ] .
tafenoquine ( tq ) ( wr238605 ) , a 5 - phenoxyl derivative of pq [ 28 ] , has improved asexual stage activity [ 29 ] , a significantly elongated plasma half - life ( two weeks vs 6 h ) [ 27,30 ] , and a greater therapeutic index [ 31 ] .
the compound remains haemolytic in g6pd - deficient individuals , though to a lesser extent than pq [ 7 ] .
in addition to use with current act , coadministration of 8 - aminoquinolines with blood schizonticides like cq and qn have been explored for their anti - relapse and toxicity - reducing effects ( see [ 32 ] for review ) .
the latter may be due to competition between the 8 - aminoquinoline and the coadministered agent for cytochrome p450s , oxidases , or other metabolic enzymes [ 32 ] .
bray et al. reported that pq and tq act synergistically with cq in vitro against the cq resistant ( cqr ) k1 strain , with no effect observed against the cq sensitive ( cqs ) d10 strain [ 33 ] , and that pq analogues lacking the aminoalkyl side chain of pq do not synergize with cq. while this synergistic effect has not been quantified clinically or in vivo , there is some preliminary evidence that cq combined with pq can lead to decreased treatment failure rates against uncomplicated cqr p. falciparum [ 34,35 ] .
pq - cq synergy has also been proposed in treatment of cqr cases of p. vivax in thailand [ 8,36 ] .
the thiazine dye methylene blue ( mb ) was the first synthetic compound ever used in the treatment of disease [ 37 ] , and there has recently been a resurgence of interest in the anti - malarial properties of mb. the compound appears to have transmission - blocking effects via potent clearance of late - stage gametocytes [ 38 ] , high blood schizonticidal activity [ 38 - 40 ] , and hz inhibition potential [ 41,42 ] , presumably due to accumulation in the digestive vacuole ( dv ) [ 38,42 ] and / or redox - cycling potential [ 41,43 - 45 ] .
mb has been observed to inhibit parasite glutathione reductase ( gr ) [ 46,47 ] , which could in theory enhance activity of drugs such as cq that cause oxidative damage ( see also [ 48 ]) .
however , akoachere et al. demonstrated that cq and mb act antagonistically against 3d7 ( cqs ) and k1 ( cqr ) strains [ 39 ] .
garavito et al. later reported this combination to be additive against strain fcm29 ( cqr ) [ 40 ] .
antagonism has also been reported in the field [ 49,50 ] , however , combination use with arts and aq have proven effective [ 50,51 ] .
regardless , in in vitro studies , efficacy of these and other drug combinations has been via standard p. falciparum growth inhibition assays .
no previous studies of drug combination effects have explicitly quantified potency in terms of cytocidal ( parasite cell killing ) activity .
given the importance of combination therapy and the attractiveness of further development of combinations using proven , cost - effective , and widely - available drugs like cq , pq , and mb ( figure 1 ) , the effects of potentially interesting drug combinations on in vitro antiplasmodial cytostatic and cytocidal activity are investigated for both a cqs and cqr strain of p. falciparum .
use of isobologram - based approaches ( see methods ) resolves conflicting accounts of synergy , additivity , and antagonism [ 33,39,40 ] , and probes the relationships between these parameters at cytostatic vs cytocidal dosages [ 19,52 ] .
the results suggest an important new concept relevant for the discovery of efficacious combination therapies .
figure 1 structures of anti - malarial drugs used in this study .
methods materials and chemicals routine chemicals , media , and solvents were reagent grade or better , purchased from sigma - aldrich ( st. louis , mo , usa ) or fisher scientific ( newark , de , usa ) , and used without further purification , unless otherwise noted .
sterile black flat bottom tissue culture , or non - sterile clear polystyrene 96 - well plates , and all other laboratory plastics were from fisher scientific ( newark , de ) .
sybr green i nucleic acid stain was from invitrogen ( eugene , or , usa ) .
anti - malarial drugs aq dihydrochloride dihydrate , cq diphosphate , mb hydrate , pq bisphosphate , and tq succinate were from sigma - aldrich ( st. louis , mo , usa ) .
parasite culture plasmodium falciparum clones hb3 ( honduras , cqs ) , dd2 ( indochina , cqr ) , and fcb ( thailand / s. africa ) were obtained from the malaria research and reference reagent resource center ( manassass , va , usa ) .
off - the - clot , heat - inactivated pooled type o + human serum and type o + human whole blood were purchased from biochemed services ( winchester , va , usa ) .
custom 5 % o2 / 5 % co2 / 90 % n2 gas blend was purchased from robert 's oxygen ( rockville , md , usa ) .
plasmodium falciparum strains were maintained using the method of trager and jensen [ 53 ] with minor modifications .
briefly , cultures were maintained under an atmosphere containing 5 % co2 , 5 % o2 , and 90 % n2 gaseous mix at 2 % haematocrit and 1 - 2 % parasitaemia in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10 % type o + human serum , 25 mm hepes ( ph 7.4 ) , 23 mm nahco3 , 11 mm glucose , 0.75 mm hypoxanthine , and 20 mug / l gentamicin , with regular media changes every 48 h. anti - plasmodial assays anti - plasmodial cytostatic ( growth inhibitory , quantified by the half - maximal growth inhibitory dose or ic50 ) and cytocidal ( cell killing , quantified by the half - maximal lethal dose or ld50 ) activity was assessed against the above strains as previously described [ 52,54 ] , with minor modifications .
the cytocidal assay utilizes a 6 h bolus dose with high concentrations of drug followed by washing drug away and growth in the absence of drug for 48 h , while the cytostatic assay utilizes continuous growth for 48 h in the constant presence of low concentrations of drug .
test compounds were dissolved in deionized water , 50 % ethanol , or dimethyl sulfoxide .
serial drug dilutions were made using complete media and 100 mul aliquots were transferred to 96 - well clear - bottom black plates .
following addition of 100 mul of asynchronous culture ( 1 % final parasitaemia , 2 % final haematocrit ) , plates were transferred to an airtight chamber , gassed with 5 % co2 / 5 % o2 / 90 % n2 and incubated at 37degreesc .
for the cytocidal assay , plates were incubated for 6 h followed by centrifugation with an eppendorf 5804 centrifuge fitted with an a - 2 - dpw rotor ( hauppauge , ny ) at 700 g for 3 min [ 52 ] .
drug - containing media was removed and cell pellets washed three times with 200 mul of complete media per wash , using the same centrifuge settings , and re - suspended in the same volume of media .
washed plates were incubated side by side with the cytostatic assay plates at 37degreesc for 48 h. after 48 h , 50 mul of 10x sybr green i dye ( diluted using complete media from a 10,000x dmso stock ) was added and plates incubated for an additional 1 h at 37degreesc to allow dna intercalation .
fluorescence was measured at 538 nm ( 485 nm excitation ) using a spectra geminiem plate reader ( molecular devices ; sunnyvale , ca ) fitted with a 530 nm long - pass filter .
linear standard curves of measured fluorescence vs known parasitaemia were prepared immediately prior to plate analysis .
background controls included fluorescence from un - infected red blood cells .
data was analysed using ms excel 2007 and ic50 and ld50 values obtained from sigmoidal curve fits to % growth / survival vs drug concentration data using sigmaplot 11.0 .
reported values are the average of three independent assays , with each assay conducted in triplicate ( nine determinations total ) and reported +/ - standard error of the mean ( s.e.m. ) , unless otherwise noted .
isobologram analysis the effect of drug combinations was assessed using the modified fixed - ratio isobologram analysis protocol [ 55 ] ( hereafter referred to as " isobologram analysis ") , with some modification .
this method detects synergy , additivity , or antagonism between a drug pair .
in general , if the drug pair has improved ic50 or ld50 potency relative to each drug alone , the combination is synergistic , if potency remains unchanged the effect is additive , and if potency is reduced the effect is antagonistic .
master stock drug solutions were prepared for each drug using complete media , such that the final concentration approximates ic50 or ld50 following 5 - 6 twofold dilutions [ 39,56,57 ] .
using these master stocks , the following volume - volume ( v / v ) mixtures of " drug a " and " drug b " were prepared : 0:4 , 1:3 , 1:1 , 3:1 , and 4:0 .
these mixtures were then two - fold serially diluted to generate a range of 8 concentrations in each case .
standard cytostatic or cytocidal antiplasmodial assay conditions ( see above ) were then followed to provide a dose response curve , and ic50 or ld50 for drug a and drug b in each v / v mixture was calculated [ 33,39,55 - 61 ] .
fractional inhibitory concentrations ( fics ) were then calculated using equations 1 , 2 and 3 [ 39,55 - 57 ] .
( 1 ) fica = ic50ofdrugaincombinationic50ofdrugaalone ( 2 ) ficb = ic50ofdrugbincombinationic50ofdrugbalone ( 3 ) ficindex = fica + ficb isobologram curves were constructed by plotting ficbvs fica .
a straight diagonal line ( ficindex = 1 ) indicates an additive effect between drug a and drug b [ 39,55 - 57 ] , concave below the diagonal ( ficindex < 1 ) indicates a synergistic effect and a convex curve above the diagonal ( ficindex > 1 ) indicates antagonism .
results similar to previous analyses of cq , qn , qd , mq and series of cq and qn analogues [ 19,20,52 ] , significant differences in cytostatic ( ic50 ) and cytocidal ( ld50 ) potency are observed for test compounds used in this work ( table 1 , see also additional files 1 and 2 ) .
also similar to previous work [ 52 ] , differences in drug sensitivity for cqs strain hb3 vs cqr strain dd2 are not of similar magnitude when potency is defined via ic50vs ld50 .
for example , dd2 is 2.4 - fold resistant to pq via ic50 but approximately three - fold more sensitive via ld50 ( table 1 ) .
dd2 shows similar cytostatic sensitivity to tq compared to hb3 , but interestingly is nearly four - fold more sensitive to cytocidal effects of tq ( table 1 ) .
as reported previously , cqr dd2 is 10 - fold cytostatic cqr (" cqrcs ") but over 100 - fold cytocidal cqr (" cqrcc ") [ 52 ] .
in contrast the related 4 - aminoquinoline aq shows similar potency against both strains , under either cytostatic or cytocidal assay conditions , which is quite rare behaviour for a quinoline anti - malarial drug based on previous examination of many quinoline compounds [ 19,20,52 ] .
similar to aq , mb is quite active relative to quinolines under both cytostatic and cytocidal conditions and shows no major differences between hb3 and dd2 , making it a promising lead compound vs cqr p. falciparum .

results of ic50 - and selected ld50 - based isobologram analyses of these drugs in various combinations are shown in figures 2 and 3 ( see also additional files 1 , 2 and 3 ) , with antagonism , additivity , and synergy findings summarized in table 2 .
in contrast to bray et al. [ 33 ] but in agreement with akoachere et al. [ 39 ] , the combination of cq - pq is antagonistic against hb3 ( cqs ) ( black curve , figure 2 top left ) and additive against dd2 ( cqr ) when potency is defined by ic50 ( black curve , figure 2 top right ) .
this combination is strongly antagonistic against both strains when potency is defined by ld50 ( figure 3 , black curves ) .
ic50 antagonism is observed with the cq - tq combination against both strains ( red curves , figure 2 top ) in contrast to synergy seen against the k1 strain ( se asia , cqr ) [ 33 ] .
aq combined with pq is antagonistic against both strains by ic50 .
aq - tq is additive against hb3 , but antagonistic against dd2 ( orange curves , middle panels figure 2 ) .
cq - aq is cytostatically additive for both strains ( figure 2 ) , but exhibits significant antagonism against dd2 under cytocidal conditions ( figure 3 ) .
overall , the important point is that synergy , antagonism , and additivity seen under cytostatic assay conditions are not necessarily conserved under cytocidal assay conditions .
similar to related conclusions based on multidrug resistance patterns [ 52 ] or drug accumulation studies [ 62 ] , these data further highlight that the mechanism ( s ) of anti - malarial drug parasite growth inhibition and parasite cell kill are not necessarily the same , and that molecular targets for the cytostatic vs cytocidal activities of some important anti - malarial drugs likely differ .

the ic50 antagonism observed for cq - aq , cq - mb and aq - mb combinations is in agreement with previous studies [ 33,40 ] , except that in the case of aq - mb , garavito et al. previously measured additive effects for these two drugs against the fcm29 strain ( cameroon , cqr ) [ 40 ] .
ic50 antagonism is also observed with pq - mb against hb3 , but additivity is seen against dd2 , in agreement with garavito et al. [ 40 ] .
finally , with the exception of ic50 additivity against hb3 ( figure 2 bottom left ) , excellent synergy is seen between tq and mb under both cytostatic and cytocidal conditions , with synergy being significantly greater in the latter case ( figure 2 ) .
importantly then , some drug combinations may show potent cytostatic and cytocidal synergy for cqr , but not cqs p. falciparum .
this is an important concept for regions where cqr p. falciparum is dominant .
to further explore one contrasting result between these data and previous [ 33 ] , the cq - pq and cq - tq combinations were reexamined against the fcb1 strain .
this cqr strain from thailand / s. africa harbours the same p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter ( pfcrt ) amino acid mutations as k1 and has a similar cq ic50 [ 63 ] ( see additional files 4 and 5 ) .
dd2 , however , differs from these two strains in a mutation at position 356 , which is i in k1 and fcb1 but t in dd2 .
mutations in the p. falciparum multi - drug resistance protein ( pfmdr1 ) are identical among these three strains [ 64,65 ] ( see additional file 6 ) .
results obtained with fcb1 are similar to those obtained with hb3 and dd2 , in that combination of cq with either pq or tq is antagonistic ( table 2 , see also additional file 5 ) .
discussion this study reports the first systematic analysis of quinoline anti - malarial drug combinations quantified for both cytostatic and cytocidal potency .
recent studies suggest that cytostatic and cytocidal mechanisms of action for some anti - malarial drugs differ [ 19,20,52,62 ] , and the present data further support this concept .
comparative investigation of drug combinations under both ic50 and ld50 conditions will enhance further development of effective combination therapies and also increase understanding of antimalarial drug pharmacology and resistance .
ic50 and ld50 data for the individual drugs reinforces this concept ( table 1 ) .
strain dd2 is 10 - fold resistant to cq ( relative to strain hb3 ) when ic50 is ratio 'd , but over 100 - fold resistant when ld50 values are ratio'd. on the other hand , the closely - related 4 - aminoquinoline aq has similar potency for both strains under both cytostatic and cytocidal conditions , a characteristic also found for art ( a. gorka , p. roepe , unpublished ) .
mb , while having nearly identical activity for the cqs and cqr strains ( behavior similar to aq ) , is about 20 - fold less potent by ld50 relative to ic50 ( unlike aq ) .
pq , an 8 - aminoquinoline known to be a poor blood schizonticide [ 17,18 ] , is nonetheless active compared to cq when potency is defined by ld50 for cqr strain dd2 ( 15.3 mum cq ld50vs 2.8 mum pq ld50 , table 1 ) .
in fact , dd2 is about three - fold hypersensitive to pq relative to hb3 when ld50 are compared .
results for drug combinations show significant differences in synergy , additivity , and antagonism ( table 2 ) , as well as in the shapes of their isobologram curves ( figure 2 ) .
in general , cytocidal antagonism is significantly more pronounced relative to examples of cytostatic antagonism .
overall , these data offer additional explanations for why in vitro ic50 - based assessment of mono - or combination therapy may not always predict results in the clinic , where both cytostatic and cytocidal potencies are critical .
the cq - pq combination results in cytostatic antagonism ( cqs ) and additivity ( cqr ) , which disagrees with data [ 33 ] for the cqr strain k1 , where potent synergy for cq - pq and cq - tq combinations was found .
in growth inhibition assays , as suggested [ 33 ] , the combination effects may be pfcrt - dependent and rely on the presence of the pq / tq basic side chain , as well as co - administration of the drug pair [ 33 ] .
as suggested [ 33 ] , due to their structural similarity to cq but increased lipophilicity , pq and tq may bind with higher affinity to the mutated pore of pfcrt and block passage of cq [ 33 ] .
however , compared to strain dd2 , the k1 strain ( cqr , s.e. asia ) differs in a pfcrt mutation at position 356 ( see additional file 4 ) [ 63 ] .
although strain k1 was not available for this study , cq - pq and cq - tq combinations were re - tested against the fcb1 strain ( cqr , thailand / s. africa ) , which bears an identical set of pfcrt [ 63 ] and pfmdr1 [ 64,65 ] mutations relative to k1 .
these combinations again exhibited antagonism ( see additional file 5 ) , indicating altered cq transport by pfcrt may not be the only factor governing combination effects .
the closely - related 4 - aminoquinoline aq also showed antagonism with pq and tq across all conditions , with the exception of aq - tq against dd2 , which was additive .
therefore , similar to the cq combinations discussed above , differences between cytostatic and cytocidal response , as well as important differences between the cqs and cqr strains are observed when aq is a partner drug .
further exploration of these concepts with other cqs and cqr strains is vital .
combination of cq with aq was purely additive against both strains by ic50 and against the cqs strain by ld50 ( figures 2 and 3 , table 2 ) .
aq is expected to have a similar overall mechanism of action to that of cq under cytostatic conditions ( e.g. inhibition of hz formation ) , so additive action of these two drugs in combination is expected for ic50 .
surprisingly though , cq - aq exhibits significant antagonism against the cqr dd2 strain by ld50 .
in light of recent evidence [ 19,20,52,62 ] , this observation again points to the general hypothesis that drug targets and the manner in which the parasite facilitates resistance to those drugs are different under cytocidal vs cytostatic conditions .
in investigating this further , future work will test for synergy , additivity , and antagonism for these drug pairs against a wider range of strains harbouring different cqr - associated pfcrt alleles .
cq - mb was cytostatically antagonistic against both strains , in agreement with akoachere et al. , who observed antagonism against 3d7 ( cqs ) and k1 [ 39 ] , but in contrast to garavito et al. , who observed additivity against the fcm29 strain ( cqr , cameroon ) [ 40 ] .
antagonism between cq and mb is surprising given the high blood schizonticidal potency of mb , its potent inhibition of hz formation in vitro [ 41,42 ] , and inhibition of parasite glutathione reductase [ 46 - 48,66,67 ] , as well as its ability to accumulate in the dv , similar to cq [ 42 ] .
however , such antagonism has also been reported in the field , with failure of cq and mb observed in treatment of uncomplicated malaria in young children in burkina faso [ 49,50 ] .
aq was also antagonistic with mb , in agreement with garavito et al. [ 40 ] .
ic50 antagonism in such cases might indicate distinctly different modes of haemozoin precursor binding [ 68 ] .
conclusions using a rigorous isobologram approach , cytocidal and cytostatic anti - plasmodial potency have been determined for various combinations of quinoline drugs and mb , for both a cqs and cqr strain of p. falciparum .
the results highlight differences in drug activity and resistance under cytostatic vs cytocidal conditions .
they also show that antagonism or synergy found for a drug pair via ic50 data ( cytostatic activity ) does not necessarily predict the same behavior when potency for the pair is quantified via ld50 data ( cytocidal activity ) .
furthermore , the data help prioritize combinations that warrant further exploration against cqr malaria ( e.g. tq - mb ) , vs those with limited applicability ( e.g. cq - pq ) .
important next steps are to examine the correlation between anti - malarial drug combination effects and hz inhibition , as well as to widen this cytostatic vs cytocidal profiling to other drugs , active drug metabolites , and many geographic isolates of p. falciparum .

it is generally acknowledged that calibration of the imaging system ( be it a spect or a pet scanner ) is one of the critical components associated with in vivo activity quantification in nuclear medicine .
the system calibration is generally performed through the acquisition of a source with a known amount of radioactivity .
the decay - corrected calibration factor is the " output " quantity in a measurement model for the process .
this quantity is a function of a number of " input " variables , including total counts in the volume of interest ( voi ) , radionuclide activity concentration , source volume , acquisition duration , radionuclide half - life , and calibration time of the radionuclide .
uncertainties in the input variables propagate through the calculation to the " combined " uncertainty in the output quantity .
in the present study , using the general formula given in the gum ( guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement ) for aggregating uncertainty components , we derive a practical relation to assess the combined standard uncertainty for the calibration factor of an emission tomography system .
at a time of increasing need for accuracy in quantification studies , the proposed approach has the potential to be easily implemented in clinical practice .
1. introduction positron emission tomography ( pet ) and single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) provide a means of evaluating the biological function of cells and organs , producing three - dimensional images of the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals introduced into the patient 's body .
these molecular imaging techniques rely on radiolabelled molecules ( generally consisting of a radionuclide and a molecule that determines the localization ) that build up in areas of disease allowing for the collection of metabolic and functional information in vivo .
over the last decade radionuclide imaging has gained popularity as a quantitative technique .
in particular , recent advances in image processing software and the advent of hybrid spect / ct and pet / ct scanners have paved the way for accurate quantitative analysis , that is , the determination of activity concentration within a given tissue of interest in absolute units , for example , becquerel per millilitre or becquerel per cubic centimetre .
pet was developed as a quantitative tool and the standardized uptake value ( suv ) is probably the most widely used indicator for the quantification of 18f - fdg pet studies .
suv is a measure of how much cellular activity occurs in the region of uptake and is mathematically defined as the concentration of the radionuclide in the volume of interest ( voi ) divided by the injected activity normalized for the patient 's body weight .
high suv values are likely to represent pathological conditions , from inflammation to infection to cancer , with higher numbers being most suggestive of cancer .
on the other hand , spect has traditionally been seen as nonquantitative .
this is because quantification using spect images is a time - consuming process , requiring accurate methods that correct for a number of degrading factors , among which are attenuation , scatter , dead time , and partial volume effects .
however , the advent of hybrid spect / ct scanners has made quantitative spect viable in a manner similar to quantitative pet .
an extensive review of potential uses for quantitative spect is given in [ 1 ] .
calibration of the imaging system is an essential prerequisite to convert reconstructed voxel values to absolute activity or activity concentration , both in spect and in pet .
as a consequence , it is generally acknowledged that calibration of the imaging system in emission tomography is a critical requirement for producing accurate quantitative data both in diagnosis and in therapy [ 2 ] .
gamma camera calibration can be performed either in air or in water .
calibration in air consists of determining the gamma camera sensitivity through the acquisition of a small volume of activity , for example , point - like source , petri dish , line source , or spherical source .
on the other hand , gamma camera calibration in water involves the use of an extended volume source mimicking the clinical conditions encountered in patient studies [ 3 ] .
the general formalism for the evaluation of the system calibration factor is given in nema publication nu 1 - 2012 [ 4 ] .
absolute calibration of the pet system ( often referred to as " well counter calibration ") is generally performed by scanning a large water - filled phantom that contains a known amount of activity .
this procedure allows counts per second to be transformed to activity concentration .
following the absolute activity calibration , the voxel intensity in any pet image is divided by the calibration factor to obtain calibrated images in terms of bqcm - 3 .
further details on the procedure for evaluating the performance of positron emission tomographs are reported in nema standards publication nu 2 - 2007 [ 5 ] .
without loss of generality , the decay - corrected scanner calibration factor src in emission tomography , the output quantity , can be written in terms of the input quantities r , the summed counts over a given voi in the image v , the volume of interest ca , the radionuclide activity concentration t0 , the acquisition start time tcal , the time of activity calibration t1 / 2 , the radionuclide physical half - life tacq , the acquisition duration as follows [ 4 , 5 ] : ( 1 ) src = rvcaexp t0 - tcalt1 / 2ln 2ln 2t1 / 2.1 - exp - tacqt1 / 2ln 2 - 1.in this formalism all input quantities have associated standard uncertainties , which propagate through the calculation to the " combined " standard uncertainty u ( src ) in the output quantity .
in the present study , using the general approach proposed in the gum ( guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement ) [ 7 ] for combining uncertainty components ( the " law of propagation of uncertainty ") , we derive a relation to assess the combined standard uncertainty for the calibration factor .
2. evaluation of uncertainty let q1 , q2 ,... , qn denote a set of n " input " quantities and y an " output " quantity or measurand .
the gum [ 7 ] considers the generic measurement model ( 2 ) y = fq1,q2 ,... , qn,that is , a known functional relationship between the input and the output quantities .
given estimates q1 , q2 ,... , qn of the input quantities , the gum uses ( 3 ) y = fq1,q2 ,... , qnas the corresponding estimate of y. further , given standard uncertainties u ( q1 ) , u ( q2 ),... , u ( qn ) associated with q1 , q2 ,... , qn , the gum applies the law of propagation of uncertainty ( lpu ) to evaluate the combined standard uncertainty u ( y ) associated with y. for independent input quantities , lpu is described by the following expression : ( 4 ) u2y = dfdq12u2q1 + dfdq22u2q2 +...+ dfdqn2u2qn,in which df / dqi denotes df / dqi evaluated at q1 , q2 ,... , qn. therefore , with reference to expression ( 1 ) , an estimate of the calibration factor src is given by evaluating this expression for estimates of the input quantities r , v , ca , t0 , tcal , t1 / 2 , and tacq , which are assumed independent .
further , the standard uncertainty u ( src ) associated with this estimate of src is given by the following ( for notational simplicity we do not distinguish between a quantity and an estimate of the quantity ) : ( 5 ) u2src = dsrcdr2u2r + dsrcdv2u2v + dsrcdca2u2ca + dsrcdt02u2t0 + dsrcdtcal2u2tcal + dsrcdt1 / 22u2t1 / 2 + dsrcdtacqu2tacq .
although the use of expression ( 5 ) , after evaluating the necessary partial derivatives , will deliver the required standard uncertainty u ( src ) , this uncertainty can be obtained more conveniently by rewriting expression ( 1 ) .
using the substitutions , ( 6 ) x1 = rvca , ( 7 ) x2 = t0 - tcal , ( 8 ) x3 = ln 2t1 / 2 , ( 9 ) x4 = tacq , ( 1 ) can be expressed as ( 10 ) src = x1exp x2x3x31 - exp - x3x4 - 1.since each quantity on the right sides of equations ( 6 ) to ( 9 ) does not appear in any others of these equations , the independence of these quantities implies the independence of x1 , x2 , x3 , and x4 .
hence , in place of expression ( 5 ) we have ( 11 ) u2src = dsrcdx12u2x1 + dsrcdx22u2x2 + dsrcdx32u2x3 + dsrcdx42u2x4.defining ( 12 ) alpha = t0 - tcalt1 / 2ln 2 = x2x3 , ( 13 ) beta = tacqt1 / 2ln 2 = x3x4,each partial derivative appearing in expression ( 11 ) can simply be expressed in terms of src , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , alpha , and beta : ( 14 ) dsrcdx1 = src1x1,dsrcdx2 = srcalphax2,dsrcdx3 = src1 + alpha1 - e - beta - betae - betax31 - e - beta,dsrcdx4 = - srcbetae - betax41 - e - beta.expression ( 11 ) can then be recast as ( 15 ) u2srcsrc2 = ux1x12 + alpha2ux2x22 + 1 + alpha1 - e - beta - betae - beta1 - e - beta2ux3x32 + betae - beta1 - e - beta2ux4x42,or , in terms of relative standard uncertainties , where , for instance , urel ( x1 ) denotes u ( x1 )/| x1 | ( x1 != 0 ) , ( 16 ) urel2src = urel2x1 + alpha2urel2x2 + 1 + alpha1 - e - beta - betae - beta1 - e - beta2urel2x3 + betae - beta1 - e - beta2urel2x4.it is noted that for most radionuclides the acquisition time is generally much smaller than the radionuclide half - life ( i.e. , tacq << t1 / 2 and , with reference to expression ( 13 ) , beta << 1 ) .
this is especially true for therapeutic radionuclides , whose half - life is typically a few days , while acquisition times are generally in the range of 10 min to 30 min .
recalling that e - beta =~ 1 - beta provided beta is reasonably small , ( 16 ) can be written in simplified form : ( 17 ) urel2src =~ urel2x1 + alpha2urel2x2 + alpha2urel2x3 + urel2x4 .
computing the combined standard uncertainty on the calibration factor according to ( 17 ) requires minimal effort and has the potential to be easily implemented in clinical practice .
the following paragraphs describe how each source of uncertainty appearing in expression ( 17 ) can be practically and effectively estimated .
2.1 .
evaluation of urel ( x1 ) using a variant of the law of propagation of uncertainty that applies to a model in product / quotient form [ 7 ] , the squared relative standard uncertainty on the term x1 ( see ( 6 )) can be expressed as the sum of the squares of the relative standard uncertainties in each of the quantities appearing in ( 6 ) : ( 18 ) urel2x1 = urel2r + urel2v + urel2ca.in turn the radionuclide activity concentration ca is given by the absolute activity a of the radionuclide divided by the volume vliq of the liquid solution in which it is dispersed ; namely , ( 19 ) ca = avliq.thus , ( 18 ) can be rewritten as ( 20 ) urel2x1 = urel2r + urel2v + urel2a + urel2vliq.considerations on how the above uncertainties can be evaluated are given below .
( i ) the relative standard uncertainty urel ( r ) of the counts r in a given voi depends on both physical factors affecting activity quantification and the noise level generated during the process of reconstructing the image .
physical factors include photon interactions in the patient , loss of spatial accuracy due to limited system resolution , partial volume effects , and noise resulting from the random nature of radioactive decay and absorption .
counting statistics and acquisition time play an additional role .
both in spect [ 8 ] and in pet [ 9 ] the coefficient of variation , that is , the ratio of the standard deviation to the average signal measured in the voi , is a viable approach to assessing the noise level .
( ii ) the relative standard uncertainty urel ( v ) is generated by the voxelization of the voi , that is , the process of converting the continuous geometric representation of the voi into a set of voxels that approximates the continuous object. by simply selecting all voxels that are intersected by the continuous voi ( that may , e.g. , be approximately spherical or cylindrical ) , the generated digital object may as a result be too coarse , including more or fewer voxels than are necessary .
for simplicity , we consider a spherical voi represented in terms of cubical voxels of side l. we consider an indicative standard uncertainty of the diameter d to be size of a voxel ; namely , u ( d ) = l. it follows that the standard uncertainty u ( r ) associated with the radius r of the sphere will be half the side of the voxel ; that is , u ( r ) = u ( d )/ 2 = l / 2 .
the standard uncertainty u ( r ) translates into a standard uncertainty u ( v ) associated with the volume delineated by the voi .
for some constant c , v = cr3 .
hence dv / dr = 3cr2 , and , accordingly , ( 21 ) urelv = uvv = 3urr = 3urelr .
thus , a relative standard uncertainty associated with a radius r induces a relative standard uncertainty associated with a volume v that is three times as large .
for instance , for a plan view of a sphere of some 150 mm in radius with a voxel side equal to 3 mm , u ( r ) = 1.5 mm. thus , urel ( r ) =~ 1 % and urel ( v ) =~ 3 % .
in practice the voi will differ from a sphere , but a mean radius r of the voi can instead be considered .
the standard uncertainty u ( r ) translates into a standard uncertainty u ( v ) associated with the volume v delineated by the voi , and the relationship v = cr3 still holds .
( iii ) urel ( a ) is the relative standard uncertainty associated with activity measurement .
at a clinical level , activity measurements are generally made using commercially available radionuclide calibrators traceable to a national standards laboratory for the geometry being measured .
the typical instrument for assaying radiopharmaceuticals is the pressurized , well - type ionization chamber .
these instruments are capable of providing radioactivity measurements with varying degrees of accuracy , depending on the radionuclide and the sample configurations ( e.g. , glass vials and / or plastic syringes ). from a regulatory standpoint , in most countries the standard of good practice is that the administered activity should be within 10 % of the prescribed activity [ 10 ] .
as a consequence , given the other sources of error involved in the administration of the radiopharmaceutical , radionuclide calibrators should provide an expanded uncertainty below 10 % , perhaps 5 % ( for a coverage factor of k = 2 , giving approximately 95 % coverage ) .
the achievable uncertainty in clinical practice is reported in the aapm guidelines [ 11 ] .
for radionuclide calibrator field instruments an expanded uncertainty no greater than 5 % is recommended for photon emitters > 100 kev .
an expanded uncertainty no greater than 10 % ( k = 2 ) for photon emitters < 100 kev is recommended [ 11 ] .
for medium and high - energy beta emitters , a radionuclide calibrator expanded uncertainty no greater than 5 % ( k = 2 ) is suggested , while for low - energy beta emitters an expanded uncertainty no greater than 10 % ( k = 2 ) is recommended [ 11 ] .
secondary standard radionuclide calibrators and reference radionuclide calibrators should be calibrated to be within an expanded uncertainty no greater than 2 % ( k = 2 ) for photon emitters > 100 kev and medium and high - energy beta emitters .
for the same instruments an expanded uncertainty no greater than 5 % ( k = 2 ) is recommended for photon emitters < 100 kev and low - energy beta emitters [ 11 ] .
( iv ) the relative standard uncertainty urel ( vliq ) is associated with volume measurement , which typically translates into weighing of masses .
as a general rule , the significant factors that contribute to measurement uncertainty across the weighing range are repeatability , eccentricity ( the error associated with not placing the weight in the centre of the weighing pan ) , nonlinearity ( the error due to the nonlinear behaviour of the balance upon increasing the load on the weighing pan ) , and sensitivity ( i.e. , systematic deviation ) .
if analytic balances are used for the measurements of small masses , uncertainties below 0.001 % can be achieved [ 12 ] .
if large masses need to be weighed ( e.g. , large phantoms filled with water mixed with radionuclide ) laboratory balances with weighing capacity of up to 100 kg to 150 kg are commercially available , yielding typical relative standard uncertainties below 0.05 % .
2.2 .
evaluation of urel ( x2 ) the relative standard uncertainty urel ( x2 ) is associated with a possible time offset between the clocks used to assess the reference calibration time tcal and the acquisition start time t0. with reference to ( 7 ) , ( 22 ) urelx2 = ut0 - tcalt0 - tcal,where u ( t0 - tcal ) is the standard uncertainty associated with the time difference between the acquisition start time t0 and the reference calibration time tcal .
the absolute time offset between the two clocks used to determine t0 and tcal can be considered representative of u ( t0 - tcal ) .
it is worth noting that the overall impact of the time offset on the calibration factor uncertainty does not depend on the absolute time difference t0 - tcal .
in fact , with reference to ( 16 ) ( also see ( 12 )) , the absolute time difference cancels leaving a dependence solely on the terms u ( t0 - tcal ) and t1 / 2 : ( 23 ) alpha2urel2x2 = t0 - tcalt1 / 2ln 22ut0 - tcalt0 - tcal2 = ut0 - tcalt1 / 2ln 22 .
figure 1 illustrates the impact of time offset on the final relative standard uncertainty , urel ( src ) , as a function of radionuclide half - life for short - lived radionuclides .
the case for two widely used diagnostic radionuclides , 18f ( t1 / 2 = 1.8 h ) and 99mtc ( t1 / 2 = 6.02 h ) , is shown .
urel ( src ) as obtained from ( 16 ) is plotted as a function of the radionuclide half - life for different values of u ( t0 - tcal ) , and the absolute time offset between the two clocks is used to determine t0 and tcal. with reference to ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) , the following relative standard uncertainties were considered : urel ( r ) = 4 % , urel ( v ) = 2 % , urel ( a ) = 2 % , urel ( x3 ) = 0.05 % , and urel ( x4 ) = 0.1 % .
as a general rule , the greater the ratio between the time offset and the radionuclide half - life is , the larger the impact on the calibration factor relative standard uncertainty is. figure 2 reports the same data for long - lived radionuclides , for example , 90y ( t1 / 2 = 64 h ) , 177lu ( t1 / 2 = 160 h ) , and 223ra ( t1 / 2 = 274 h ) .
the extreme case of u ( t0 - tcal ) = 24 h is presented .
2.3 .
evaluation of urel ( x3 ) with reference to ( 8 ) , urel ( x3 ) represents the relative standard uncertainty of the radionuclide half - life t1 / 2 : ( 24 ) urelx3 = urelt1 / 2.the calibrated activity value for a standard ( as for any instrument ) refers to a fixed reference date , and the half - life must be known with sufficient accuracy in order to calculate the activity at the time the standard ( or instrument ) is used , which may well be several half - lives later .
metrology of radionuclide activity is a mature science and many data are currently available with sufficiently small uncertainties for most practical purposes .
table 1 lists adopted half - life values and associated uncertainties for a selection of radionuclides used both in diagnosis and in therapy .
the relative standard uncertainty of the half - life of radionuclides typically used in clinical practice is well below 0.1 % .
2.4 .
evaluation of urel ( x4 ) with reference to ( 9 ) , urel ( x4 ) is the relative standard uncertainty associated with the overall acquisition time tacq : ( 25 ) urelx4 = ureltacq.both in spect and in pet , the acquisition time is defined by the user and it is computer - controlled by the workstation software .
therefore , assuming that the software accesses the clock correctly , the accuracy of timing functions is determined by the accuracy of the clock itself .
therefore , timing tests are recommended within the quality assurance programme , consisting in the verification of the acquisition time recorded by the computer [ 13 ] .
in clinical practice accurate estimates of the scan time can generally be achieved and this uncertainty component is likely to make negligible contribution to the uncertainty in the calibration factor .
caution is advised in the presence of dynamic studies in spect , where timing errors between frames may become considerable at high counting and framing rate [ 13 ] .
2.5 .
calibration factor relative standard uncertainty equation ( 17 ) gives a simplified form for the relative standard uncertainty urel ( src ) in the calibration factor src. by combining this equation and ( 20 ) , ( 22 ) , ( 24 ) , and ( 25 ) the combined standard uncertainty in the calibration factor of an emission tomography system can be obtained .
in terms of relative standard uncertainties , ( 26 ) urel2src =~ urel2r + urel2v + urel2a + urel2vliq + t0 - tcalln 2t1 / 22.urel2t0 - tcal + urel2t1 / 2 + urel2tacq .
equation ( 26 ) has the potential to be easily implemented in clinical practice to assess the combined relative standard uncertainty urel ( src ) in the calibration factor of an emission tomography system .
2.6 .
additional sources of uncertainty affecting quantification in emerging pet imaging modalities there are a number of factors affecting the accuracy of image - based activity estimates , both in spect and in pet .
attenuation and scatter of photons degrade the image quality and the accuracy of activity estimates varies with the object size due to the limited spatial resolution , dead time , and partial volume effects .
the presence of random coincidences plays an additional role in pet and it is currently the subject of ongoing research in pet imaging .
as a consequence , proper compensation techniques are required to perform accurate absolute quantification with emission tomography .
a detailed description of all possible sources of uncertainty in activity quantification falls outside the scope of this paper and the reader is referred to [ 14 ] for an extensive review on this topic .
attenuation is the loss of events because of their absorption in the body and it is by far one of the main factors impacting quantification studies .
in hybrid spect / ct systems ct data can be used to correct for attenuation on a slice - by - slice basis. of note , because attenuation varies with photon energy , it is necessary to rescale the ct attenuation data to match the energy of the radionuclide used in spect .
this rescaling is generally accomplished by using a bilinear model relating attenuation coefficients at the desired energy to ct numbers measured at the effective energy of the ct beam of x - rays [ 15 , 16 ] .
similarly , on pet / ct scanners , the attenuation map is assessed by rescaling ct hounsfield units to 511 kev attenuation coefficients .
as a consequence , in both hybrid spect / ct and pet / ct systems , further uncertainty is likely to be introduced in the quantification process .
currently , pet coupled with mri as a hybrid imaging modality is receiving increasing attention and it is likely to become the technology of choice in the future .
a different attenuation correction strategy is required in combined pet / mr systems .
in fact , the small bore inside the scanner and the strong magnetic field do not permit a rotating ct device to be integrated .
as a consequence tissue attenuation information needs to be determined from the mr image [ 17 ] .
attenuation correction through mr images is inherently challenging as mri image intensity correlates with proton density and relaxation properties of tissue , not with tissue density .
as an example , bone and cavities present similar signal intensities in mri .
however their density produces the highest and lowest attenuation in pet , respectively .
many studies have been published on correction strategies using mr imaging , including intensity - based tissue type segmentation and classification of an mr image [ 18 - 20 ] and atlas - based segmentation techniques [ 21 , 22 ] .
attenuation correction through mr images has the potential to introduce quantification inaccuracies .
evaluation of the quantitative accuracy of mr - based attenuation correction in terms of suv error has been discussed by several authors [ 23 - 25 ]. of note , resent research has proven that tof pet has the potential to remarkably reduce attenuation correction artifacts and quantification errors in the lungs and bone tissues [ 26 ] .
yet another question of interest is the possible uncertainty introduced by radiation yield and decay branching ratios of radionuclides used in the clinical practice .
against this backdrop , the 90y positron branching ratio deserves special attention .
in fact , 90y is traditionally thought of as a pure electron emitter originating from 90y conversion into 90zr ( beta decay ) .
however previous studies showed that the decay of 90y has a minor branch to the 0 + first excited state of 90zr at 1.76 mev , that is followed by a beta +/ beta - emission [ 27 ] .
in recent years , a number of authors have used the small positronic emission of 90y , ( 3.186 +/ - 0.047 ) . 10 - 5 [ 28 ] , to obtain high - resolution positron emission tomography ( pet ) images of 90y biodistribution after liver radioembolization .
since the accuracy on the evaluation of the absorbed dose to the patient depends on the knowledge of the 90y positron branching ratio , the accuracy of 90y pet / ct imaging and dosimetry is strongly related to the measurement precision of the internal pair production branching ratio .
in the near future , new experimental measurements of the internal pair production branching ratio are desirable in order to achieve more accurate quantification in postradioembolization imaging using pet / ct. a recent joint research project ( empir - mrtdosimetry [ 29 ]) is currently dealing with this issue .
the project will carry out new measurements to determine branching ratios and emission probabilities for 90y with greater accuracy .
this will be the first step for providing greater reliability of 90y and will enable improved quantitative imaging accuracy and dose estimation for such radiopharmaceutical .
3. discussion radionuclide imaging and its quantitative characteristics are increasingly being recognized as providing an objective tool for diagnosis , staging , and therapy response evaluation .
in addition , the advent of hybrid spect / ct and pet / ct systems and the introduction of relatively new radiopharmaceuticals has generated much interest in activity quantification .
calibration is the process of establishing the relationship between the measured count rate per volume and activity concentration .
understanding the factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the calibration factor is essential to obtain reliable quantitative information in clinical practice .
interpretation of quantitative data without appreciating the magnitude of the associated uncertainty may result in clinical errors or misleading information .
over the last few years a number of studies [ 30 , 31 ] and european projects [ 29 , 32 ] have been dedicated to the assessment of factors affecting the calibration procedures , both in spect and in pet .
against this backdrop , reducing the uncertainty associated with activity quantification has become a key objective in clinical practice , especially in the light of recent technological advances allowing for the possibility of using quantitative data for dosimetry purposes .
in the present study the decay - corrected calibration factor src was described as a function of a number of " input " variables , whose uncertainties propagate through the calculation to the " combined " uncertainty in the output quantity .
combining ( 17 ) and ( 20 ) we derived a practical formula , ( 26 ) , that can be used in clinical practice to assess the combined relative standard uncertainty urel ( src ) in the calibration factor of an emission tomography system .
our analysis showed that a number of factors may potentially contribute to urel ( src ) .
in particular , the relative standard uncertainty urel ( r ) of the counts r in a given voi and the relative standard uncertainty associated with activity measurements , urel ( a ) , may play a major role .
the latter may lie between 2 % and 5 % depending on the activity calibrator used .
however , if activity is determined by a national metrology laboratory then this uncertainty can be reduced dramatically .
within this context , experimental verification of the accuracy of commercial radionuclide calibrators is essential when they are used in a clinical setting .
past research [ 33 ] tested a number of commercial radionuclide calibrators to verify the accuracy of activity measurements when the instrument provided by the manufacturer is used without change .
the study showed that some instruments met the 5 % specification on accuracy for a range of radionuclides .
however , some instruments provided readings that were up to 90 % in error , while others showed systematic discrepancies for all radionuclides tested [ 33 ] .
therefore , in order to reduce the standard uncertainty urel ( a ) associated with activity measurements , there is a continuing need for calibration and testing of clinical instruments using reference standards traceable to national primary standards .
according to ( 26 ) , clock offsets t0 - tcal between the calibration time of the radionuclide and the acquisition start time may introduce further uncertainty .
this statement is particularly true for short half - life diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals such as 18f and 99mtc , where the impact of clock offset on the final relative standard uncertainty may be significant ( see also figure 1 ) .
for the above reason , an essential requirement for accurate activity administration and quantitative data analysis is that clocks within a nuclear medicine department , within all instruments and all computers , be synchronized and checked daily ( or at least weekly ) .
current eanm procedure guidelines for tumour pet imaging state that , in the case of [ 18 ] f - fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) pet imaging , clocks should be synchronized with the official local time within 1 min [ 34 ] .
in addition , if the time of activity calibration is temporally distant from the acquisition start time , ( 26 ) reveals that the final uncertainty may significantly increase , especially when system calibration is performed with short half - life radionuclides ( see the term involving urel ( t1 / 2 ) in ( 26 )) .
ultimately , the typical relative standard uncertainty urel ( t1 / 2 ) associated with the half - life of radionuclides used in both diagnostic and therapy is about ( and often below ) 0.05 % [ 6 ] .
it is worth noticing that a recent study on this subject [ 35 ] found that the spread of experimentally determined half - life values for a particular radionuclide may be larger than expected from the claimed accuracies [ 35 - 37 ] .
the foremost cause of the tendency to underestimate the uncertainty of experimentally determined half - life values is due to a number of reasons , among which are possible inaccuracies in data analysis [ 35 - 37 ] .
to the best of the authors' knowledge , this paper is the first work analyzing how all meaningful sources of uncertainty propagate through the calculation to the combined uncertainty in the calibration factor .
in the present research , a simplified formula for the assessment of the combined uncertainty in the calibration factor was derived .
we believe that , at a time of increasing need for accuracy in quantification studies , the proposed approach has the potential to be easily implemented in clinical practice .
4. final message as a final message we note that in recent years there has been an increase in the development and use of radiopharmaceuticals for molecular radiotherapy ( mrt ) .
within this context internal dosimetry has become a central issue in mrt , as there is increasing evidence that treatment outcome is related to the absorbed doses delivered to tumours and to normal organs rather than to the administered activities [ 38 ] .
this statement is particularly relevant in the light of the recent ec directive 2013 / 59 / euratom , article 56 , which states that individual dose planning for radiotherapy patients ( including mrt ) must be enforced in legislation by eu member states by 6 february 2018 .
as a consequence , within the next few years , internal dosimetry is set to become an important component in mrt clinical practice .
system calibration is a central issue in mrt as accurate activity quantification is required to achieve reliable dosimetry .
the current state of the art for quantitative activity measurement is the use of combined spect - ct or pet - ct imaging to provide a 3d distribution of activity within the patient .
to give absolute activity , the system must be calibrated and each image must be corrected for a number of degrading effects ( e.g. , scatter , attenuation , partial volume effect , and dead time ) .
in spite of the increasing awareness that an accurate assessment of the absorbed dose to critical tissues would provide a more effective targeted use of mrt , there are no validated standard protocols or any established methods for calibration or verification of system performance .
against this backdrop , an iaea coordinated research project was begun in 2009 ( e21007 development of quantitative nuclear medicine imaging for patient specific dosimetry ) with the purpose of addressing the lack of harmonized protocols or guidelines .
another research project , funded by the european metrology research programme ( emrp ) and finished in 2015 , aimed to develop and improve the standards and calibration methods for measuring radioactivity , quantitative imaging , and dose calculations [ 32 ] .
the project , named metromrt ( metrology for molecular radiotherapy ) , formulated mrt dosimetry as a measurement chain that is traceable to primary standards .
the links in the chain are ( i ) measurement of administered activity ; ( ii ) sequence of activity measurements through quantitative imaging procedures ; ( iii ) construction of an activity - time function from the sequence ; ( iv ) integration of the activity - time function ; and ( v ) calculation of the absorbed dose from the activity - time integral. of note , one of the main aims of the project was to investigate the uncertainties entailed in each step of the measurement chain .
ultimately , an empir - funded joint research project begun in 2016 , named " metrology for clinical implementation of dosimetry in molecular radiotherapy " ( mrtdosimetry , [ 29 ]) , is aiming to provide the metrology for the clinical implementation of absorbed dose calculations in mrt .
the project is building on the results and outputs from the preceding emrp metromrt project .
in conclusion , the mrt community has an urgent need for dosimetry calibration standards , validation methods , and clear guidance on how to implement mrt dosimetry in every european clinic offering mrt .
comprehensive guidance has yet to be presented in this field and there is no doubt that internationally endorsed recommendations for good practice would lead to further advances in this area .

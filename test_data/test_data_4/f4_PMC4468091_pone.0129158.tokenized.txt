background undernutrition and inflammation are related in many ways ; for instance , non - hygienic environments are associated with both poor growth and immunostimulation in children .
objective to describe any existing interaction among different inflammation biomarkers measured in the distinct anatomical compartments of whole blood , feces , plasma and saliva .
methods in this descriptive , cross - sectional study , samples of whole blood , feces , plasma and saliva were collected on the 8th and last week of observation among 87 attendees ( 42 girls and 45 boys ) of 3 daycare centers offering a common 40 - day rotating menu in guatemala 's western highlands .
analyses included white blood cell count ( wbc ) , fecal calprotectin , and plasmatic and salivary cytokines including il - 1b , il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 10 and tnf - alpha .
associations were assessed using spearman rank - order and goodness - of - fit correlations , as indicated , followed by backwards - elimination multiple regression analyses to determine predictor variables for il - 10 in both anatomical compartments .
results of a total of 66 cross - tabulations in the spearman hemi - matrix , 22 ( 33 %) were significantly associated .
all 10 paired associations among the salivary cytokines had a significant r value , whereas 7 of 10 possible associations among plasma cytokines were significant .
associations across anatomical compartments , however , were rarely significant .
il - 10 in both biological fluids were higher than corresponding reference values .
when a multiple regression model was run in order to determine independent predictors for il - 10 in each anatomical compartment separately , il - 6 , il - 8 and tnf - alpha emerged as predictors in plasma ( r2 = 0.514 ) and il - 1b , il - 8 and tnf - alpha remained as independent predictors in saliva ( r2 = 0.762 ) .
significant cross - interactions were seen with wbc , but not with fecal calprotectin .
conclusion interactions ranged from robust within the same anatomical compartment to limited to nil across distinct anatomical compartments .
the prominence of the anti - inflammatory cytokine , il - 10 , in both plasma and saliva is consistent with its counter - regulatory role facing a broad front of elevated pro - inflammatory cytokines in the same compartment .

introduction the immune system , in its complexity , is constituted of specialized cells with specific secretory or functional roles .
there are the rapid " innate " and the slower " adaptive " immune responses , highly integrated by hormonal signaling or cell - to - cell cross - talk [ 1 ] .
these mobilize cellular elements , including , phagocytic , inflammatory and natural killer cells , among others , along with molecular components , such as hepatic acute - phase proteins and cytokines originating from a wide variety of tissues .
the cytokines produced by white blood cells constitute a series of " interleukins. " differentiation of thymic - derived helper cells produces subclasses supporting up - regulating , pro - inflammatory cytokines ( th1 ) and counter - reacting , down - regulating anti - inflammatory cytokines ( th2 ) .
[ 1 ] .
the th1 - directed acute - phase response directs a catabolic intermediary metabolism , tending toward poor tissue growth and wasting of nutrients [ 2 ] .
guatemala has the highest prevalence of under - five stunting in latin america [ 3 ] .
poor linear growth begins in utero [ 4,5 ] , and continues during the first 2 y of life [ 6 ] .
stunting generates a series of adverse consequences not only in infancy and childhood , but also over the longer term ; as summarized by dewey and begum [ 7 ] : " childhood stunting ( was ) linked with short adult stature , reduced lean body mass , less schooling , diminished intellectual functioning , reduced earnings and lower birth weight of infants born to women who themselves had been stunted as children. " in the context of the complexity of immune reactivity , linear growth impairment is associated with immunological alterations such as impaired gut - barrier function , reduced delayed - type hypersensitivity responses , atrophy of lymphatic tissue whereas the cytokine patterns seem to be skewed towards a th2 - response [ 8 ] , as part of a well - described cytokine - induced or infection - induced malnutrition [ 9 ] .
it has long been established in livestock and poultry [ 10,11 ] that unclean and contaminated environments retard body growth and weight - gain .
roura et al .
[ 12 ] identified a cytokine - mediated immunological stress as the mechanism for this growth failure .
in 1993 , solomons , et al .
[ 13 ] proposed an explanation for poor linear growth based on the theory of environmental contamination and poor utilization of nutrients .
it has been proposed that decreasing inflammatory episodes will improve long - term outcomes on linear growth [ 14 ] .
interventions to prevent environmental enteropathy during infancy such as wash ( water , sanitation and hygiene ) in kenya and bangladesh or shine ( sanitation hygiene infant nutrition efficacy ) in zimbabwe suggest that low - grade , chronic inflammation may impair infant growth and that reducing fecal - oral transmission of pathogenic microbes during infancy will reduce prevalence of stunting in developing countries [ 15,16 ] .
a plausible mechanism for the direct interference with linear growth by infection comes from the work with an infected - mouse model [ 17 ] , in which endogenous stress compounds ( il - 1b , cortisol ) interrupt the hormonal cascade to the epiphyseal growth plate that signals elongation of bone .
hence , linear growth retardation is not only due to undernutrition or lack of nutrients ; additionally , continuous inflammation of the body promotes the malabsorption and wasting of nutrients and dysregulation of skeletal growth .
in the course of a research project entitled " study on the normative state and inter - and intra - individual variation in growth , hematology , hydration , and markers of oxidation , infection and inflammation in pre - school children with a similar dietary intake " , we collected data on white blood cells , a biomarker of intraluminal intestinal inflammation , and a parallel series of selected cytokines in plasma and saliva among preschool children in a governmental system of daycare centers .
we attempted to find any possible interaction among the inflammatory biomarkers from different anatomical compartments as an example of immunological cross - talk and reafferent integration of the system .
we present here the findings from this exploration in young children within the context of variable environmental and genetic circumstances , within the potentially stabilizing and harmonizing influence of a common institutional dietary offering .
materials and methods study design the following descriptive , cross - sectional , field study on the variation and associations among variables related to inflammation is part of the larger undertaking entitled : " study on the normative state and inter - and intra - individual variation in growth , hematology , hydration , and markers of oxidation , infection and inflammation in pre - school children with a similar dietary intake. " population and setting the study was conducted in guatemala in the western highlands province of quetzaltenango , known for its rural - based agrarian environment. with its capital city located 220 km from guatemala city at 2357 m above sea level , quetzaltenango province has a majority indigenous population ( 60.6 %) and an annual mean daily low temperature of 14.7degreesc , but varying from - 12 to 25degreesc .
study subjects were children attending daycare centers ( hogares comunitarios ) within the secretariat of beneficial programs of the first lady ( secretaria de obras sociales de la esposa del presidente - sosep ) in three different settings : one semi - urban , one marginal - urban , and one rural .
each site had differences in its proportional ethnic make - up and the corresponding cultural customs and traditions .
the rural site had an almost exclusively mam - mayan indigenous enrolment .
sosep daycare centers offer a common , 40 - day rotating menu .
it is standardized in its recipes and provides four meals per attendance day .
recruitment and enrolment of subjects children from three daycare centers were eligible to enroll and be included in the analyses if they were : 1 .
attending one of the centers ; 2. between 2 and 7 years - old ; and 3 .
( post - hoc ) had at least an 80 % daily attendance record in the center during the time of the study .
moreover , they had to be apparently healthy and without restrictions related to the acceptance of the diet offered in the sosep menu .
children whose parents or caregivers did not sign the consent form , or who did not adhere to the full fecal collection schedule were selectively excluded from the analyses .
ethical considerations the sosep 's director for the quetzaltenango area authorized the study to be performed within the system .
the human subjects committee of the centre for the studies of sensory impairment , aging , and metabolism ( cessiam ) granted ethical approval for the study protocol .
a parent or guardian signed the written consent form after the purposes , benefits , inconveniences and risks of the procedures had been explained .
children gave a final assent at the moment of collection .
as a collective benefit , any missing dietary items were subsidized by the study funds in order to provide all food items on the menu at all times , whenever the situation required .
this study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct02203890 .
anthropometric measurements we performed anthropometric determinations during the last 7th week of each daycare center 's 8 - week period .
height was measured using a wooden wall stadiometer , and expressed in cm to the nearest 0.5 cm , with children standing without shoes and with their gaze in frankfort plane .
weight was determined using a calibrated tanita model bc522 digital scale ( tanita , tokyo , japan ) ; still with shoes removed .
it was expressed in kg to the nearest 0.1 kg. an adjustment was made for clothing , subtracting a standard weight - for - clothing factor for girls' and boys' daytime clothes , respectively .
collection , handling and storage of biological samples in order to confirm the delivery of the 40 - day rotating menu , we spent 8 weeks on each day - care center as an observation period from june to november , 2012 , with sample collections beginning in july and extending to the end of the field activities .
whole blood assays ( white blood cell count ) were performed on the day of blood collection .
fecal samples were frozen - stored for from 3 to 16 weeks prior to analytic processing .
plasma and saliva samples , destined for cytokine assays , were frozen - stored for up to one year prior to the analyses in spain .
blood ( plasma and whole blood ) blood samples were collected at each of the three centers during the last week of the 8 - week study .
a phlebotomist extracted the blood using bd vacutainer 4 ml tubes , anticoagulated with edta ( no.367861 ) in conjunction with safety - lok deposable needles ( no.367281 ) ( becton - dickinson , nj , usa ) .
five hundred microliters of the sample were separated in a tube and taken to la democracia hospital 's clinical chemistry laboratory in order to obtain hemograms .
the rest of each sample was centrifuged to separate red blood cells from plasma ; the supernatant plasma was stored in nalgene cyrogenic vials ( no.5000 - 0012 ) ( u.s. plastics corporation , lima , oh , usa ) in a - 80degreesc freezer in the capital city prior to shipment to granada , spain , in order to measure plasma cytokines like interleukin - 1 - beta ( il - 1b ) , interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) , interleukin - 8 ( il - 8 ) , interleukin - 10 ( il - 10 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) .
fecal samples in the 7th week of the 8 - week period , we supplied a container to the parents or caregivers to collect a fecal sample on the next morning , before bringing the child to the daycare center .
whenever the container was returned empty , we collected the sample if it was produced during the day ; we repeated the process until we had all participants' samples .
when samples were complete , they were taken to the local laboratory where we started the pre - preparation of the specimens to measure calprotectin ; these were stored in a - 20degreesc freezer , ready for biomarker assaying .
saliva on the day of blood collection , we also collected a saliva sample .
children were asked not to eat or drink anything during the two hours before saliva collection .
saliva was immediately stored in dry ice until storage in a - 80degreesc freezer in the capital city and later shipped ( again in dry ice ) to granada , spain , in order to perform a parallel set of cytokine assays in both plasma and saliva .
laboratory assays and analyses white blood cell count analyses were performed in quetzaltenango , guatemala , at the la democracia hospital 's clinical chemistry laboratory , using the beckman coulter act diff hematology analyzer ( krefeld , germany ) .
white blood cell counts are expressed as quantity per mm3 volume .
fecal calprotectin assays were performed in quetzaltenango , guatemala .
elisa assays were executed using the calpro calprotectin elisa test from calpro as ( lysaker , norway ) .
catalog no. cal0100 .
concentrations were expressed in mg / kg of fecal sample .
the detection limits were 25 - 2500 mg / kg , and a typical inter - assay cv was 3.7 % .
plasma and saliva cytokines samples were analyzed in granada , spain , using the milliplex map human high sensitivity cytokine panel from luminex corporation ( missouri , usa ) catalog # hscytmag - 60sk for the five aforementioned classes of cytokines .
the results were expressed in pg / ml. the cytokines of interest for both plasma and saliva were : il - beta , il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 10 and tnf - alpha .
the minimum detection limit was 0.06 , 0.20 , 0.05 , 0.48 and 0.07 respectively .
the inter - assay cvs for plasma were 14.73 % , 7.74 % , 8.65 % , 12.17 % and 8.40 % , respectively .
for salivary cytokines cvs were 10.99 % , 13.88 % , 13.31 % , 7.74 % , 10.99 % and 13.34 % , respectively .
data handling and statistical analyses the software spss version 20 was used to create a database and run analyses .
descriptive statistics were expressed as the distribution in terms of median , 95 % ci , and minimum and maximum .
associations of values collected at different points in time were tested by spearman rank - order coefficient , as appropriate .
we also ran the goodness - of - fit model to obtain correlation coefficients .
in order to refine the predictive determination in the associations among the inflammation biomarkers , backwards - elimination multiple regression models were run to determine the parsimonious r2 value .
a probability level of <= 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant .

in the face of multiple comparisons with this number of cross - correlations , however , one could expect that at least 3 would reach a probability level of 5 % by chance alone .
hence , at least 19 of the associations are likely to be truly significant .
the highest degree of linear association , with an r value of 0.871 , was salivary il - 8 and salivary tnf - alpha .
however , all 10 paired associations among the salivary cytokines had an r value > 0.600 and a probability value of 10 - 3 .
the lowest r values still reaching the criterion for significance were a pair at 0.222 and 0.226 involving paired correlations of plasma il - 1b with two salivary cytokines ; the notable exception was with salivary and plasmatic tnf - alpha .
inter - biomarker associations by goodness - of - fit correlations table 3 illustrates the 22 out of 66 spearman rank - order correlations that reached the <= 0.05 p - value criterion for statistical significance , juxtaposed with the corresponding r value for the goodness - of - fit correlation .
also shown is the curve - form of the goodness - of - fit correlation .
the magnitude of the r value improved ( increase of > 0.020 decimal points of improvement above the spearman coefficient ) in 9 instances ( 41 %) , with the greatest increment that of a 50 % increase in the value of the association of il - 10 with il - 6 in plasma ; r values remained relatively stable ( change of - 0.020 to + 0.020 ) in 7 cases ( 32 %) ; and the value declined ( decrease of > 0.020 ) in 6 ( 27 %) .
the cubic curve - form was the predominant one , emerging in 7 regressions , followed by sigmoid and power curve - forms with 6 each .
the remaining 3 curve - forms were a growth , a compound , and a logarithmic .

those involving il - 1b have been excluded for reasons of space .
compared across biological fluids of origin , il - 10 with il - 8 shows a cubic form in the goodness - of - fit correlation ; the association was stronger in the salivary pair .
similarly , a common curve - form , power , was shared by il - 10 with tnf - alpha across fluids , again showing the stronger association in saliva .
only in the il - 10 association with il - 6 did the curve - forms differ between anatomical compartments : for plasma , the form was cubic and for saliva , it was the power form .
in this instance , plasma showed the stronger association .

associations by backwards - elimination multiple - regression modeling to evaluate the independence of the prediction in the hemi - matrix of binary inter - variable spearman correlations ( table 4 ) by backwards - elimination multiple regressions , we anchored on the cytokine il - 10 , as it was the only anti - inflammatory ( th2 ) cytokine assayed and would theoretically be a counter - weight to the other 4 ( pro - inflammatory ) cytokines in the series .
restricted to the domain of only the plasma cytokines , the regression modeling produced the parsimonious model with an r2 value of 0.514 , with il - 6 , il - 8 and tnf - alpha remaining as predictor variables , after 2 models .
when regression modeling was extended to include white blood cell count , which also had a significant association , the r2 value remained unchanged ; it strengthened further to an r2 of 0.595 , however , with all 11 complementary variables included in the modeling .
the variables contributing determination within the model after serial modeling were plasma tnf - alpha , il - 6 , il - 8 ; and salivary il - 1b .
on the salivary 1l - 10 side of the ledger , modeling with the remaining 4 salivary cytokines produced an r2 of 0.762 in the final model , in which il - 1b , il - 8 and tnf - alpha remained as predictors after 2 models .
adding in further values from other , non - salivary biomarkers actually weakened the magnitude of the r2 values of the resultant models .

calprotectin is a leukocyte - derived protein found in the cytosol of inflammatory cells that has been established as a sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation [ 24,25 ] .
we found 53 ( 61 %) children with a calprotectin value > 50mg / kg ; this is almost twice the median value for a group of ugandan children of a roughly comparable age and living in a correspondingly low - income setting [ 26 ] .
as mentioned , cytokines are low - molecular - weight proteins that regulate immune responses , acting as mediators and messengers and are secreted by one cell to alter its own - another cell 's - function [ 1 ] .
cytokines were analyzed in two compartments : plasma and saliva .
for both anatomical compartments , our reference was the reported normative - range in postmenopausal women from new york from browne et al .
[ 18 ]. with regard to the plasmatic compartment , 19 ( 23 %) of the subjects had levels of cytokines above the reference range for il - 1b ; this was 96 % for il - 6 ; 0 % for il - 8 ; 100 % for il - 10 and 100 % for tnf - alpha .
also , data from 223 normal - weight subjects from across spain [ 27,28 ] , which were analyzed in the same laboratory with the same method and instruments can be used as reference values .
for il - 6 , the mean value for spanish children of 4.4 pg / ml compares to our median value of 3.7 pg / ml ; for il - 8 , their result of 1.6 pg / ml mean of spanish children is one - third that of the guatemalan median of 4.5 pg / ml ; and for tnf - alpha , the spanish reference mean of 3.1 pg / ml is less than one half of our median of 7.5 pg / ml. browne et al .
[ 18 ] also provide normative values for the same cytokines in the salivary compartment in their study among postmenopausal women .
in this anatomical compartment , 3 ( 4 %) of our subjects have levels of cytokines above the reference range for il - 1b ; this was 6 % for il - 6 ; 14 % for il - 8 ; 75 % for il - 10 ; and 75 % for tnf - alpha .
in general , with some exceptions , we could find modest to high rates of elevation when compared to reference values across the biomarkers from the 4 anatomical compartments .
mutual interactions of cytokines within and across anatomical compartments of all of the biomarkers , il - 10 ( plasmatic and salivary ) and il - 8 ( salivary ) had the widest range of cross - associations , i.e. with 5 of the 11 companion biomarkers .
if we isolate the interactions by type of biomarker , we see a predominance of what could be called " auto - correlation " , that is association within the same compartment , specifically within salivary or plasmatic fluids. of the possible ten cross - associations within the cytokines of the plasmatic compartment , 7 were statistically significant , whereas all ten possible correlations were significant in the salivary compartment. of even more interest in a biological sense might be the significant associations between biomarkers of different anatomical compartments , e.g. plasma versus saliva , wbc versus feces , etc .
the only significant correlations between anatomical compartments were those with plasma il - 1b with salivary il - 8 and with salivary il - 10 .
goodness - of - fit models were run in order to improve the association with the best curve - form ; strength of association improved in less than half of the significant correlations .
we also decided to run the backwards - elimination multiple - regression model with il - 10 , the only anti - inflammatory ( th2 ) cytokine measured in each anatomical compartment .
in each model , three variables emerged to be independent predictors , with il - 8 and tnf - alpha commonly present as predictors in models for both anatomical compartments .
within - individual correspondence of cytokines in plasma and saliva because of the ease and innocuousness of saliva collection , especially for children , it has been recommended to exhaustively pursue its potential utility in field diagnosis [ 29 ] .
in a survey of the salivary - cytokine literature , we find that the majority involve local conditions arising close to the salivary glands , such as oral inflammation [ 30,31 ] or head neck or oral , cancer [ 32,33 ] .
our observed dissociation of the cytokine response between the circulating pattern and that in the saliva , moreover , is neither unprecedented nor implausible .
in the present study , we found no significant plasmatic : salivary associations for any of the 5 cytokines measured in both anatomical compartments .
browne et al .
[ 18 ] , in postmenopausal women , measured and associated the same 5 cytokines in both anatomical compartments with the same lack of significant association ; their only finding of a significant plasmatic : salivary correlation was for il - 5. with il - 6 as the only biomarker measured , grisius et al .
[ 34 ] and minetto et al .
[ 35 ] found no significant inter - compartmental correlation in healthy north american and italian adults , respectively ; this was also the experience of fernandez - botran et al .
[ 36 ] , investigating emotionally - abused women , again with il - 6 as their only cytokine biomarker of interest .
among 8 cytokines , including the same 5 assayed in the present study , measured concurrently in plasma and saliva in healthy female adolescents , riis et al .
[ 37 ] found only il - 1b to reach a statistically - significant correlation between compartments .
in 2013 , byrne et al .
[ 38 ] evaluated 11 cytokines , including 4 of the 5 cytokines measured here , across the anatomical compartments in healthy australian adolescents ; they found significant associations only for il - 2 , il - 12 and inf - gamma , but for none of the cytokines measured in the present study .
a final - and atypical - finding comes from patients with acute myocardial infarction in an iranian hospital ; among 4 cytokines measured in both the circulation and saliva , high inter - compartmental associations ( all with p values of < 0.001 ) were found for three : il - 2 ; il - 6 ; and tnf - alpha [ 39 ] .
despite the lack of individual correspondence of the cytokine concentrations , we applied them on a sub - group analysis .
as a post - hoc exercise to further pursue the association of the systemic ( plasma ) and salivary compartments to reflect the aggregation of inflammation , we created a cumulative rank - order score for the 5 cytokines in each biological fluid .
separately , for each anatomical compartment , the sum of the rank ( in ascending order ) of each child in each of the 5 distributions : that is , the child with the lowest cytokine in each anatomical compartment was ranked as 1 , and the individual with the highest value was ranked number 80 , the number of children that had data for all cytokines .
thus , the combined composite scale could run from a high of 400 ( the same individual was most inflamed for all 5 cytokines ) to a low of 5 ( the same individual was least inflamed for all 5 cytokines ) .
as calculated , the individual cumulative rank - order score values ranged from 35 to 361 for the plasma biomarkers and 15 to 398 for the salivary .
even with this composite scoring of all cytokines , the spearman correlation coefficient for the plasma cumulative rank - order score with its salivary counterpart still showed an insignificant association ( r = - 0.036 , p = 0.749 ) .
because circulating cytokines arise from adipose , hepatic and peripheral and tissue - fixed white blood cells [ 1 ] , they would respond to systemic immuno - stimulation ; by contrast , the salivary cytokines arise in salivary and oral sites governed by local events in and around the buccal cavity [ 40 ] .
it would seem that systemic immune response has low penetrance to the sites of salivary cytokines' origin .
hierarchical , group - wise relationships of cytokine biomarkers although there is scant inter - compartmental correspondence at the individual level , that fact does not dismiss all of the possibilities .
the question still remains as to whether salivary cytokines can be used as a proxy for those in the circulation on a group - wise basis .
a survey in sweden approached the utility of salivary cytokines as an epidemiological tool for screening for systemic diseases [ 41 ] .
they considered tobacco smoking and 8 selected systemic disease conditions as self - reported by 1000 adults in southern sweden .
the cytokine biomarkers were il - 1b , il - 6 , il - 8 and tnf - alpha .
for histories of heart surgery , heart disease , hypertension , diabetes and mental disorders , there were no associations with elevated salivary cytokines .
moreover , with salivary il - 6 and tnf - alpha , there were no association with any of the selected conditions .
however , salivary il - 8 was elevated significantly in those reporting being smokers and having a history of tumors , bowel diseases and muscle and joint disorders .
the latter was also associated independently with elevation of il - 1b .
they suggest a certain utility of salivary cytokine biomarkers in population epidemiology .
plasma cytokines were not concurrently measured .
similar explorations of salivary cytokines with systemic diseases have been reported individually including : inflammatory bowel diseases [ 42 ] ; pediatric type 1 diabetes [ 43 ] ; obesity - related sleep apnea [ 44 ] ; and cutaneous lichen planus [ 45 ] .
cytokines elevations were found for il - 8 among 90 salivary proteins after total body irradiation [ 46 ] , similarly anti - inflammatory cytokine , il - 10 , rose in saliva of airway - disease patients when exposed to thermal sulfur water bath therapy [ 47 ] .
finally , monitoring of diverse salivary biomarkers during 520 days of simulated space travel to mars , showed no change in the 4 cytokines evaluated : il - 2 , il - 6 , tnf - alpha and inf - gamma [ 48 ] .
research surrounding stress responses and the anti - inflammatory cytokine , il - 6 has been prominent .
reviewing the literature , slavish and graham - engeland [ 49 ] conclude that the findings are currently inconsistent .
salivary il - 6 has been elevated in response to a social stress test [ 50 ] , viewing disgusting visual images [ 51 ] , spinning gyrations on a rotary device [ 35 ] , and a psychiatric counseling visit [ 52 ] ; this response was not seen , however , exercising to the point of exhaustion [ 35 ] .
the elevation was also associated with active post - traumatic stress syndrome ( ptsd ) associated with spousal abuse in women [ 52 ] .
in three situations in two studies , circulating il - 6 was simultaneously evaluated .
the salivary and plasmatic responses corresponded with ptsd [ 52 ] and rotator stress [ 35 ] , but not with exhausting exercise [ 35 ] .
to examine this group - wise phenomenon in our own study setting , we calculated medians of the previously - described composite cytokine rank - order scores .
we analyzed them by daycare site and by each body fluid ( table 5 ) .
interestingly , in the sense of a common trend , the relative hierarchy was common across anatomical compartments , with the highest cytokine rankings clustered in the rural zone for both composites scores ; the intermediate values are in the marginal - urban area ; and the lowest rankings are seen in the semi - urban setting .
the kruskal - wallis test , however , failed to find a significant difference among the sites .

strengths and limitations of the study we acknowledge certain strengths and weaknesses of design and execution of the study .
the principal strength is that it deals with childhood , with children of preschool age , in a context of poor hygienic environment .
also related to young age are two collection methods , fecal and salivary , which are non - invasive and do not require the extraction of blood .
in theory , the settings with similar dietary offering should control one important variable , and narrow overall variance .
an additional strength is the possibility to relate a large variety of inflammatory biomarkers from different anatomical compartments .
a very important methodological strength is that we can compare our cytokine values with those generated with the identical multiplexing method [ 18 ] , and , in the case of the spanish children [ 27,28 ] , a similar age - range and the same laboratory and equipment in granada .
the foremost limitation of the study is that our sample - size of 87 is modest , and the analyses by separate daycare site may have lacked statistical power to fully capture differences by geographical setting ( table 5 ) .
in addition , we were not able to measure the two most commonly used biomarkers of inflammation , crp and apg , if not simply to relate them to the more sophisticated cytokine panels .
moreover , saliva is a viscous matrix .
at least for an elisa method , dafar et al. , [ 53 ] found that extraction with sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) improved the detection of one of the cytokines of interest , salivary il - 8 ; whether this applies to the milliplex method as well is not known .
thomas et al .
[ 54 ] examined day - to - day fluctuation in salivary il - 1b , il - 6 and tnf - alpha finding coefficients of variation of up to 200 % .
as our design called for only a single day 's collection , we can perhaps understand how the internal correlation among salivary cytokines could be so well coordinated while their associations with biomarkers in other anatomical compartments could be so poor .
one could generalize this point to project that associations with factors external to the subjects might only be revealed with multiple repetitions of the measurements in the same individuals .
conclusion twelve biomarkers of inflammation from the whole blood , fecal , plasma and salivary compartments showed a diverse array of findings and interactions among low - income preschool children from the western highlands of guatemala .
in general , the indicators were elevated above reference levels , suggesting a response to the microbial and antigenic milieu of the poorly hygienic surroundings in which they live .
the marker of fecal inflammation exhibited no interaction with any biomarker in any other domain .
white cells showed a modest interaction , associating positively with three circulating cytokines .
similarly modest were the cross - associations for cytokines between plasma and saliva , with plasmatic il - 1b having two significant - and negative - associations .
within - compartment , however , the plasma and salivary cytokines showed a vigorous mutual interaction .
the prominence of the anti - inflammatory cytokine il - 10 in both plasma and saliva is consistent with its counter - regulatory role in the face of elevated pro - inflammatory cytokines .

biogas slurry has become a serious pollution problem and anaerobic digestion is widely applied to pig manure treatment for environmental protection and energy recovery .
to evaluate environmental risk of the emission of biogas slurry , luminescent bacteria ( vibrio fischeri ) , larvae and embryos of zebrafish ( danio rerio ) were used to detect the acute and development toxicity of digested and post - treated slurry .
then the ability of treatment process was evaluated .
the results showed that digested slurry displayed strong toxicity to both zebrafish and luminescent bacteria , while the ec50 for luminescent bacteria and the lc50 for larvae were only 6.81 % ( v / v ) and 1.95 % ( v / v ) respectively , and embryonic development was inhibited at just 1 % ( v / v ) .
slurry still maintained a high level of toxicity although it had been treated by membrane bioreactor ( mbr ) , while the lc50 of larvae was 75.23 % ( v / v ) and there was a little effect on the development of embryos and v. fischeri ; the results also revealed that the zebrafish larvae are more sensitive than embryos and luminescent bacteria to pig slurry .
finally , we also found the toxicity removal rate was higher than 90 % after the treatment of mbr according to toxicity tests .
in conclusion , further treatment should be used in pig slurry disposal or reused of final effluent .
pig slurry luminescent bacteria zebrafish toxicity reduction 1 .
introduction due to limited fossil energy resources , renewable bio - energy technologies are regarded as alternative of fossil fuels in the future [ 1,2 ] .
in recent years , biogas based on methane fermentation is becoming an attractive energy resource in many nations worldwide [ 3 ] .
in china , there are more than 1.5 x 104 biogas projects based on livestock and poultry breeding [ 4 ] , which was expected to alleviate the energy shortage and reduce the emission of the waste .
however , it still poses environmental risk in biogas project even slurry was successfully anaerobically digested .
zhong et al. found there were high concentrations of heavy metals , such as cd cu , ni , and zn in the digested slurry [ 5 ] .
in addition , some toxic organic pollutants also influence the effective utilization of biogas slurry , such as polychlorinated dibenzo - p - dioxins ( pcdd ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcb ) , polyaromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) , perfluorinated alkyl compounds ( pfcs ) , linear alkylbenzene sulfonates ( lass ) , nonylphenols and nonylphenol ethoxylates ( np / npeos ) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( pbdes ) [ 6 ] .
recent research has focused on treatment methods for slurry , which could be potential requirement of the risk evaluation of slurry , especially toxicity .
on the other hand , some useful toxicity evaluation methods have been applied to the industrial effluents .
recent study finds the treated olive mill wastewater still had a certain degree of toxicity to vibrio fischeri [ 7 ] .
similarly , it was possible that post - treated slurry would be still not suitable to release to river although it had been treated and reach discharge standard .
thus , biological toxicity tests in vivo and in vitro need to be applied to slurry management .
bulich , a.a. et al. firstly reported the possibility that phototobacterium phosphoreum could be applied to the toxicity evaluation of wastewater in the 1800s [ 8 ] , more and more model organisms were developed .
up to now , more than eight methods have been developed and applied to different industrial effluents .
main bio - indicators could be luminescent bacteria [ 9 ] , algae [ 10 ] , daphnia magna [ 11,12 ] and fish .
in these methods , the luminescent bacterium test , or microtox test is one of the assays that frequently used for the acute toxicity assessment of environmental samples such as water and sediments [ 13 ] , as well as pure compounds [ 14 ] , for its relatively inexpensive , well - reproducible results , and fast testing procedure .
the luminescence of bacteria depends on the existence of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , fluorescein ( fmn ) and luciferase , so any factors that interfere or damage the respiration of the bacteria or physiological process can reduce the activity of luminescent bacteria .
there are many different kinds of luminescent bacteria , such as vibrio , photobacterium , shewanella , xetorhabdus , and the most of vibrio , photobacterium , shewanella were marine bacteria .
so far , photobacterium phosphoreum , vibrio fischeri ( iso 11348 - 3 ) [ 15 ] , and vibrio qinghaiensis were widely used into total toxicity evaluation of different industrial effluent , such as textile finishing industry [ 16 ] , tannery wastewaters [ 17 ] and so on. for further evaluation of health risk , toxicity tests with early development stage of aquatic organisms have been introduced as a faster and more cost - effective way .
moreover , study showed that the early developmental stages of fish are often the most sensitive to toxic effects [ 18 ] .
for relatively large , robust embryos and rapid embryonic development , zebrafish could be an ideal vertebrate model organism ; moreover , transparent body is easily observed when zebrafish is developing outside their mother fish [ 19,20,21 ] .
it was reported that some indexes , such as embryos production , atretic oocytes and altered ovarian histology and embryos mortality , could be useful to evaluate pharmaceutical mixture and municipal wastewater [ 22 ] .
in this study , biological toxicity testing method was introduced to pig slurry , where related report on toxicity of slurry is still lack of study now .
here , v. fischeri , newly hatching larvae of zebrafish was used to evaluate acute toxicity of pig slurry , and embryos ( 1 hpf , 1 h post - fertilization ) of zebrafish was for development toxicity .
using these methods , both digested and post - treated slurry were investigated to provide useful information about health risk of slurry and ability of the treatment process to reduce the toxicity of pig slurry , combined with physicochemical indexes ( chemical oxygen demand ( cod ) , ammonia nitrogen ( nh3 - n ) , total phosphorus ( tp ) , etc. ) .

2. experimental section 2.1 .
collection and determination of physicochemical index of samples all samples of pig slurry were collected in xinxin forage corporation in jiaxing city of china. and before , pig slurry was pretreated by solid - liquid separation .
anaerobically digested and post - treated slurry ( a 43 l membrane bio - reactor ) were collected respectively .
digested slurry was collected in the outlet of anaerobic digester .
treated slurry was collected in the outlet of membrane bioreactor .
each index was determined three times respectively .
after collection , physic - chemical variables were determined .
conductivity , ph , nh3 - n , tp and cod were determined by conductivity meter ( monitoring and analysis method of water and waste water , in chinese ) , glass electrode method ( gb / t6920 - 1986 , in chinese ) , nessler 's reagent colorimetric method ( gb / t7479 - 1987 , in chinese ) , ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method ( gbt11893 - 1989 , in chinese ) and potassium dichromate method ( gb / t11914 - 1989 , in chinese ) respectively. and then the samples were stored at 4 degreesc until used .
before the toxicity experiments , all samples were diluted , where de - ion water was used in luminescence experiment , and standard dilution water [ 23 ] was used in zebrafish experiment .
2.2 .
luminescent bacteria freeze - dried marine luminescent bacteria ( v. fischeri nrrl b - 11177 ) were made in ampoule using freeze - drier ( fd - 5 / 8. , beijing boyikang test co. , beijing , china ) .
after the recovery of the freeze - dried powder , the initial luminous intensity needed to be between 2 x 106 and 5 x 106 , which was detected by glomax - multi detection system ( promega co. , wisconsin , wi , usa ) with a 96 - well microplate ( corning / costar co. , new york , ny , usa ) .
2.3 .
zebrafish adult zebrafish ( ab strain ) were maintained in a recirculating aquaculture system ( aquaneering co. , san diego , ca , usa ) .
in incubation process , the 12 h light period was followed 12 h dark period per day .
in the light period , the fish were fed with freshly hatched shrimp eggs and flake fish food ( tetra , melle , germany ) , twice and once respectively .
the incubation temperature was controlled at 28 +/ - 0.5 degreesc .
2.4 .
fertilized of zebrafish embryos to hatch zebrafish embryos , one adult female fish and one adult male fish were placed in the same box .
after the formation of zygote , embryos were washed 2 - 3 times by standard dilution water , for removing residues .
finally , normal developed fertilized eggs which were observed by the ts100 - f microscope ( nikon , tokyo , japan ) were collected for subsequent experiments .
2.5 .
toxicity tests 2.5.1 .
luminescent bacteria toxicity test luminescent bacteria test was performed using 96 - well microplate on the glomax - multi detection system .
due to high toxicity of slurry and in order to eliminate the effect of the color and density on results , filtered samples were diluted to avoid complete inhibition .
in this paper , volume percentage of sample in de - ion water was adopted to represent dilution degree , where raw sample is 100 % v / v and de - ion water which was used as control sample was 0 % v / v. the procedure in detail which was referring to research of froehner et al .
[ 24 ] was as follows : 100 mul de - ion water as blank controls was added to the first row of microplate , 100 mul sample with various dilution ( respectively 100 % , 50 % , 25 % , 12.5 % , 6.25 % , v / v ) were added to the second , third , fourth , fifth and sixth row of microplate respectively. and then 100 mul bacteria suspension were added to each test well .
after 15 min exposure , the luminescence intensity was measured .
all of tests were repeated three times , while average luminescence intensity was adopted to dose - effect plot .
finally , the toxicity of slurry was characterized by relative luminous intensity and the concentration for 50 % of maximal effect ( ec50 ) .
2.5.2 .
larvae of d. rerio acute toxicity test the d. rerio 96 h acute toxicity test was carried out according to the procedure described in iso7346 - 1 [ 25 ] .
to detect toxicity using zebrafish larvae , digested and post - treated slurry were diluted to a series of exposure solutions to avoid complete inhibition due to high toxicity of slurry .
here volume percentage of sample in standard dilution water was adopted to represent dilution degree , where raw sample of digested and post - treated slurry is 100 % v / v and standard dilution water which was used as control sample was 0 % v / v. in exposure experiment , ten normally developed larvae were transferred to each culture dish ( 100 mm ) containing 15 ml sample with different dilution degree .
the number of dead larvae was counted at 24 h , 48 h , 72 h and 96 h after exposure to slurry .
in this experiment , five different dilution degrees were introduced to evaluate the toxicity of slurry .
2.5.3 .
toxicity test of zebrafish embryos to detect toxicity using zebrafish embryos , diluted samples were needed to be prepared to avoid complete inhibition due to high toxicity of slurry .
normal embryos ( at approximately 1 hpf ) were kept in 24 well cell culture plates , with one embryo per well .
each well contained 1ml control or exposure wastewater .
two replicates for the controls and exposure groups were used .
for each control and exposure group , the early embryonic development was observed by the ts100 - f microscope and mortality was recorded at an interval of 24 h. after 72 h exposure experiments , mortality , hatching rate and malformation rate of embryos in each group were recorded .
similarly , five different dilution degrees were adopted [ 26 ] .
2.6 .
methods of toxicity evaluation the toxicity of pig slurry on zebrafish larvae was evaluated using 96 h lethal concentration 50 ( lc50 ) , for v. fischeri and zebrafish embryos , ec50 and elc50 , hec50 and mec50 were used respectively .
in this paper , elc50 , hec50 and mec50 were used to represent the concentration of wastewater for 50 % of embryonic mortality , hatching and malformation respectively while exposed to the pig slurry .
finally , toxicity unit ( tu ) was used to represent the toxicity directly .
tu was calculated according to the formula as follows [ 27 ] : ( 1 ) if the inhibition of luminescence intensity for v. fischeri , hatching rate for zebrafish embryos , mortality for zebrafish larvae were lower than 50 % and malformation rate for zebrafish embryos was lower than 50 % exposed to pig slurry , it showed lc50 ( ec50 ) could n't be calculated , tu was calculated according to the formula as in equation ( 2 ) [ 27 ] : tu = re x 100 x 0.02 ( 2 ) where re was the relative inhibition rate of v. fischeri luminosity and death rate of larvae and embryos of zebrafish (%) and the toxicity remove rate was calculated according to the formula as follows : ( 3 ) 2.7 .
statistical analysis using origin 8.0 ( origin lab , northampton , ma , usa ) , the median lethal concentration ( lc50 ) and the median effect concentration ( ec50 ) on d. rerio and luminescent bacteria of pig slurry were calculated , followed with one - way anova in spss 16.0 .
here statistical significance difference of exposure group to the control group was set to p < 0.01 .
3. results 3.1 .
physicochemical characterization of pig slurry effluents the calculated values of physicochemical indexes were listed in table 1 .
it showed that pollutants in the pig slurry were reduced mostly after the treatment of mbr , where the value of nh3 - n and cod of raw water were reduced 94.5 % and 86.0 % respectively .
on the other hand , the allowed values of nh3 - n and cod are 80 mg / l and 400 mg / l respectively , according to discharge standard of water pollutants for livestock and poultry breeding ( gb 18596 - 2001 ) [ 28 ] .
it meant the effluent could be discharged legally .

effect on luminescent bacterial exposed to pig slurry the dose - response curves after 15 min exposure were plotted using logistic model , shown in table 2 and figure 1 .
dose - response curve is nonlinear fitted by logistic regression model ( equation ( 4 )) : ( 4 ) the relative luminosity of v. fischeri exposed to digested and post - treated slurry , were 6.9 % and 66.8 % respectively , which means both of them had a certain degree of inhibitory effect on the v. fischeri .
table 2 showed good statistical significance for regression model while the r2 was higher than 0.99. and the toxicity could be divided into the following four categories based on ec50 [ 7 ] : ( i ) high toxicity for samples with an ec50 < 25 % ; ( ii ) moderate toxicity , ec50 25 % to 75 % ; ( iii ) low toxicity with a 75 % to 100 % of ec50 ; ( iiii ) non - toxicity , ec50 ca n't be calculated .
the ec50 of digested slurry to v. fischeri was 6.81 % dilution , which means high toxicity .
in contrast , relative luminosity was inhibited only 40.09 % by raw sample for post - treated slurry , which is lower than 50 % .
so ec50 of post - treated slurry ca n't be calculated , which meant non - toxicity to luminescent bacteria .
according to the tus , toxicity remove rate of was 94.6 % for mbr - treated slurry .
compared with the physicochemical characteristics of slurry , the similar remove effect was proved .

effect on zebrafish larvae exposed to pig slurry the results of 96 h acute toxicity test of zebrafish larvae were showed in figure 2 and table 3 .
as figure 2 described , when larvae were exposed to digested slurry ( 2.5 % , v / v ) , the mortality had already reach 100 % .
on the other hand , the same effect on mortality could be found while the volume percentage was up to 100 % for post - treated slurry .
table 3 showed lc50 of larvae exposed to digested and post - treated slurry were different , 1.95 % and 75.23 % respectively .
according to tu , treatment of mbr reduces the toxicity by 97.5 % .
the results showed the high degree of reduction of toxicity after treatment by mbr .
it showed that the reduction rate calculated by 96h acute toxicity test of larvae was not much different from by luminescent bacterial acute toxicity test and physicochemical indexes .

effect on the early development of embryos exposed to pig slurry post - treated slurry showed a certain degree of toxicity to mortality , hatching and malformation ( 45 % , 25 % and 41.7 % respectively in table 4 ) compared with control group .
in 72 h experiments with embryos exposed to digested and post - treated slurry , there was a significant effect on embryonic mortality , hatching rate and malformation rate , while the elc50 , hec50 and mec50 of embryos exposed to digested slurry were 3.48 % , 1.32 % and 3.47 % respectively. and post - treated slurry showed no inhibition to the embryos of elc50 and mec50 .
however , the ec50 of hatching rate of embryos exposed to post - treated slurry reached 31.81 % ( table 5 ) .

according to the tu in table 6 , the remove rate of toxicity to mortality , hatching and malformation were 96.9 % , 95.9 % and 97.1 % respectively. with microscopic observation , malformed embryos displayed the different status , such as the 24 h no extension of the embryonic tail , 24 h coagulated egg , 48 h pericardial edema , 48 h pigment deposition , 72 h - malformed larvae .
on the other hand , 24 h development of eyespot and 48 h otoconial development were not found in this experiment ( figure 3 ) .

4. discussion the application of biogas engineering has received considerable attention in recent years , while there are many controversies about the advantages and disadvantages of biogas slurry .
in some studies , slurry could be used to give rise of high yields to crops.j. abubaker et al .
[ 29 ] conducted a study on the fertilizing performance of pig slurry and mineral fertilizer in terms of spring wheat yield , in conclusion , pig slurry gave the overall highest yields to wheat .
gobernaa et al .
[ 30 ] compared biogas digestates with fresh manure to the inhibition of pathogenic bacteria in soils , and found anaerobic digestion significantly sanitized the manure by completely eliminating cultivable e. coli and salmonella .
however , toxic pollutants in the biogas slurry could be dangerous to environment .
many different pollutants had been found in slurry .
for evaluation of availability of slurry , some researches were conducted .
using daphnia magna , a.i. de la torre et al .
[ 31 ] stated that toxicities of pig slurry were higher than urban effluents and lower than industrial effluents .
for evaluation of acute and development toxicity of slurry , v. fischeri , zebrafish larvae and embryos were exposed to digested and post - treated slurry respectively .
in this study , different trophic level organisms showed different sensitivity to digested and post - treated slurry .
the sensitivity order of the three test organisms was larva > embryo > v. fischeri .
the difference of larva and embryo of zebrafish could result from membrane out of the embryo , which selectively restrict big molecule compounds to enter into embryo , which could be regarded as protective effect on the embryo [ 32 ] , as had been reported by wiegand c et al .
[ 33,34 ] .
there is little literature on the conductivity requirements for zebrafish larva and embryo , but adult zebrafish are tolerant to conductivity ranging from 400 mus.cm - 1 to more than 1000 mus.cm - 1 [ 35 ] .
in this study , conductivity of digested and post - treated slurry was both far higher than 1000 mus.cm - 1 .
in addition , there was a correlation between conductivity and salinity generally. and v. fischeri was regarded as marine bacteria , so probably the higher sensitivity of fish versue v. fischeri could be mainly due to the different salinity tolerance .
it showed the use of the marine bacteria tests is very important because it can avoid effect of salinity on test organism , this conclusion has also been confirmed by pardo et al .
[ 36 ] .
figure 4 variance analysis for relative luminosity of v. fischeri exposed to digested and post - treated slurry .
data are mean standard deviation ; n = 3 , per group .
** p < 0.01 , others were no significant differences .
result also demonstrated that pig slurry had a high toxicity to both v. fischeri and zebrafish .
the toxicity of digested slurry to v. fischeri was 14.68 tus , which was higher than the tu of phenol ( 12.5 tus ) and lower than that of dimethyldiuron ( 16.23 tus ) .
meanwhile , the toxicity of post - treated slurry to v. fischeri was 0.80 tu , which was between the tu of polyethylene glycol ( 0.78 tu ) and cypermethrin ( 0.91 tu ) [ 37 ] .
in addition , relative luminosity of v. fischeri exposed to post - treated slurry , was very significantly inhibited comparing with the de - ion water .
on the other hand , relative luminosity of v. fischeri was higher than 100 % ( anova , p < 0.01 ; figure 4 ) , when effluent was diluted to a certain degree of volume percentage .
some nutrients existed in pig slurry could enhance the cell activity of luminescent bacteria .
similar results could be observed in pure compounds experiments .
for example , relative luminosity of v. fischeri was higher than 100 % when the concentration of phenol was lower than 0.005 mg / l [ 38 ] .
probably because that the inhibition on biological effect was lower , and bacterial recovery effect is stronger .
in addition , zebrafish larvae were all dead when exposed to digested and post - treated slurry , the same effect as the zebrafish embryos exposed to digested slurry , however the mortality of embryos exposed to post - treated slurry was lower than 50 % .
meanwhile , effects of pig slurry on the early developing zebrafish embryos were observed .
the experiment of embryos exposed to post - treated slurry also showed that the hatching rate was lower than 30 % and malformation rate was more than 40 % .
according to reported development toxicity test of urban sewages using zebrafish embryos , hatching rate of embryos was more than 80 % and malformation rate of embryos was lower than 20 % respectively [ 39 ] .
it showed the toxicity of pig slurry was higher than urban sewages .
moreover , 96 h lc50 and toxicity of post - treated slurry to the zebrafish larvae were higher than 70 % and lower than 2 tus respectively .
according to acute toxicity test of zebrafish larvae exposed to fat - plant effluent , showed that the value of lc50 of larvae exposed to effluent was lower than 70 % , reported by sisman t. et al .
[ 40 ] .
in addition , adult zebrafish were used to evaluate the toxicity of industry effluent , such as electronic and electroplate effluent , the result showed the tu of effluent was 2.54 [ 41 ] .
then considering that zebrafish larva is more sensitive than adult zebrafish .
thus , toxicity of post - treated slurry was lower than industrial effluents. and it showed that it was necessary to apply treatment to slurry , owing to high environmental risk .
apparently , we could find the toxicity of digested slurry was reduced mostly after the treatment of mbr according to the luminescent bacteria toxicity test and zebrafish larvae acute toxicity test , the removal rate was 94.6 % and 97.5 % respectively , meanwhile according to the results of physicochemical index determination , post - treated slurry could be discharged legally .
however , mortality of larvae still reached 100 % when exposed to post - treated slurry .
besides other toxics , such as ammonia could be responsible for the toxicity of pig slurry .
recent study shows that ammonia can be physiologically harmful to hypophthalmichthys molitrix larvae , through increasing the concentration of reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage products such as lipid peroxides [ 42 ] .
among the physiochemical characteristics of the slurry ( nh3 - n , tp and cod ) , there was a high correlation between the toxicity removal rate and reduction rate of nh3 - n. it meant the decrease of concentration of nh3 - n , toxicity of pig slurry has also been reduced .
so result that nh3 - n made much greater contribution on slurry toxicity could be obtained and further treatment should be used in pig slurry disposal or reused of final effluent .
in this paper , risk information was acquired while evaluation method was applied to pig slurry .
however , more organisms for quantitative assessment are necessary .
so a battery of bioassays based on organisms belong to different trophic levels , are strongly suggested , which could get a risk score by the application of a synthetic index for toxicity [ 43 ] , combining algae , daphnia magna and so on .
5. conclusions pig slurry had showed different toxicity effect on v. fischeri and zebrafish. and larva was the more sensitive one to all the test wastewater , followed by embryo of zebrafish and finally , v. fischeri .
furthermore , both v. fischeri and zebrafish could be used in the toxicity reduction and risk assessment of pig slurry , and provided suggestions for its treatment process .
based these methods , risk information of slurry could be acquired .
here digested slurry displayed strong toxicity to luminescent bacteria , zebrafish larva and embryo .
on the other hand , post - treated slurry still showed low toxicity although it has reached the discharged standard , and toxicity remove rate has reached up more than 90 % .
considering that , too much discharged slurry could exceed rural river carrying capacity , advanced treatment for slurry , such as ion exchange technique , wet oxidation process , biological nitrogen removal system and so on , are suggested .

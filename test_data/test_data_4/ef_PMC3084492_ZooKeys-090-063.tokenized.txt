abstract larvae of the ground beetle genus eustra schmidt - goebel are described and illustrated for the first time and some biological notes are reported .
one specimen of an unknown eustra species was collected while excavating a nest of the ant pachycondyla javana mayr , in taiwan , which is the first report of a paussine associated with a member of the ant subfamily ponerinae .
several larvae and adults of a second species , eustra chinensis banninger , were collected in shanghai under bark with no association with ants .
first instar larvae of the latter species were also reared in the lab .
the occurrence of larvae of the genus eustra both inside and outside ant nests , together with a report of adults collected inside a nest in taiwan , suggests that members of this genus may be facultative predators or facultative symbionts of ants , an attribute that has never been reported for this genus .
the larvae of eustra show several unique features , including a peculiar bidentate mandibular apex , an extremely long galea , one of two tarsal claws greatly reduced , abdominal setae ( including those of terminal disk ) elongate and clavate at apex , urogomphi wide and flattened , and inflated sensilla s - i. larvae were studied by both optical and scanning electron microscopy , their morphological features are compared with those of other described paussinae larvae , and their potential phylogenetic and functional significance are discussed .
keywords flanged bombardier beetles myrmecophily systematics larvae southeast asia introduction eustra schmidt - goebel is an ozaenine genus ( carabidae : paussinae ) containing twenty - two species ( reviewed by deuve 2001 ) .
adults in this southeast asian genus have the smallest body size of all members of the subfamily paussinae .
many eustra species live in caves and exhibit typical structural adaptations to a troglobitic life , including loss of pigmentation , loss of eyes , and long , delicate appendages .
other species are not cave - dwelling , but rather they have been collected in microhabitats typical of other ozaenines including under rocks and under bark .
recently larvae of two species of eustra were collected in the field .
both adults and larvae of eustra chinensis banninger were collected in shanghai while they were hibernating in rotting wood and a single larva of an unidentified species of eustra was collected during the excavation of nests of the ant pachycondyla javana mayr in taiwan , suggesting for the first time that at least some species of eustra are facultatively associated with ants ( moore 2006 ) .
many different animals , especially arthropods , profit from a facultative or obligate association with ants ( myrmecophily ) , bypassing the behavioral and chemical defenses of the hosts and adapting to the peculiar environmental conditions of the nests .
since myrmecophiles are rare and live in concealed environments , our knowledge of their behavior is sparse , and most of the information we do have has been inferred from structural features of adults and larvae ( di giulio and moore 2004 ; di giulio et al. 2011 ) .
the paussinae , commonly known as flanged bombardier beetles , are a good model taxon to study the evolution of myrmecophily in beetles , since members of this ground beetle subfamily have different degrees of associations with ants , ranging from apparently none to obligate myrmecophiles ( see geiselhardt et al. 2007 and references therein ) .
as far as we know all members of the tribes protopaussini and paussini are myrmecophilous , at least during the larval stage , and their associations with ants have either been directly observed in the field or deduced from their remarkable structural adaptations .
most of these species associate with members of the ant subfamilies formicinae and myrmicinae .
in general , very little is known about the behaviour of the ozaenines ( di giulio and vigna taglianti 2001 ; moore and di giulio 2006 ; moore 2008 ) .
like most ground beetles , they are usually found under stones , bark , and rotting wood and they are night - active predators on other arthropods .
ozaenine larvae are known for only nine species in four genera ( itamus , sphaerostylus , pachyteles and physea ) ( see di giulio and moore 2004 ) .
they all have a terminal disk composed of modified abdominal tergites and urogomphi , which is a synapomorphy for the subfamily ( bousquet 1986 ) .
unlike the physogastric myrmecophilous larvae of the tribe paussini which use their round terminal disk as a glandular symphilous organ ( oberprieler 1985 ; bousquet 1986 ; luna de carvalho 1989 ; di giulio and moore 2004 ; di giulio et al .
2011 ) , free - living larvae of metriini , mystropomini and ozaenini use their terminal disk as a door to close the galleries they construct in rotten wood , humid earth or sandy riverbanks , and they use the moveable components of the terminal disk to trap their prey ( costa et al .
1988 ; di giulio and vigna taglianti 2001 ) , seizing them with their sharp mandibles through a backward spring - like movement .
this specialized feeding strategy allows these delicate larvae to feed on fast moving invertebrates and to occasionally feed on ants .
it is likely that many non - myrmecophilous members of the subfamily paussinae facultatively feed on ants , as has been demonstrated in the tribe metriini ( moore and di giulio 2008 ) .
we hypothesize that myrmecophagy may be a preadaptation for myrmecophily .
members of the ozaenine genus physea brulle are known to live inside the nests of the neotropical leafcutting ants , atta , and both larvae and adults have structural adaptations for this lifestyle ( eidmann 1937 , di giulio et al. 2003 ) .
recently adults of other ozaenine species have been found inside atta nests including adults of tachypeles moretianus deuve and serratozaena paraphysea deuve ( moore 2008 ) .
based on structural features of adults , myrmecophily has also been hypothesized for the southeast asian species dhanya mulu stork ( stork 1985 ) , and the south and central american genera ozaena olivier and platycerozaena banninger ( ball and mccleve 1990 ) .
larval specimens of the malagasy species sphaerostylus goryi ( laporte de castelnau ) were recently collected both in rotten wood with ants and in leaf litter without apparent association with ants ( wm , personal observations ) .
the discovery of an eustra larva inside a pachycondyla javana nest in taiwan is the only report of a paussine associated with a member of the ant subfamily ponerinae ( moore 2006 ). that eustra larvae have been collected both inside and outside of ant nests suggests the possibility that they are at least facultatively associated with ants .
in addition , a report of adults of eustra sp. collected inside an ant nest in taiwan was posted on the internet ( http :// nc.kl.edu.tw / bbs / showthread.php ? t = 653 & page = 9 ) .
these findings suggest that more ozaenine taxa may be facultative or obligate myrmecophiles , even those without evident structural adaptations , and they suggest that myrmecophily has evolved multiple times during the evolution of in paussinae ( moore 2006 ; moore et al. 2010 ) .
in this paper we : ( 1 ) present biological information about the habitats and behaviors of eustra chinensis and the eustra species from taiwan observed in nature and in captivity ; ( 2 ) describe and illustrate these larvae ; ( 3 ) discuss the functional significance of several unique characteristics of the genus ; and ( 4 ) compare them to other described paussine larvae .
methods material described ( 1 ) eustra chinensis banninger , 1949 .
twenty - five adults and several larvae were collected in shanghai on february 9 , 2009 and april 6 , 2008 .
they were found hibernating together in the soft , rotten wood of bristly locust ( robinia hispida linnaeus,1767 ) and weeping willow ( salix babylonica linnaeus,1753 ) .
adults and larvae can be found in shanghai throughout the year .
they overwinter as both adults and larvae ( all larval instars ) , from november to april .
presumably , while these larvae are overwintering they do not feed .
in captivity , a third instar larva overwintered without food for more than six months .
during this time they did not close the opening of their galleries with their terminal disks , as they do to facilitate feeding during the spring and summer ( as described for other ozaenine larvae , see costa et al .
1988 ; di giulio and vigna taglianti 2001 ; moore and di giulio 2006 ) .
( 2 ) eustra sp. a single third instar larva was collected in northern taiwan ( shan - shya [ sic ]) by gustav tzh - wei chen on 9.ix.2003 while excavating a nest of pachycondyla javana mayr ( hymenoptera , formicidae , ponerinae ) .
the specimen was identified as belonging to the genus eustra , by a phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequence data obtained from this specimen and from sixty other members of the subfamily paussinae , including other members of the genus eustra .
rearing conditions larvae of eustra chinensis were reared in captivity , where ambient conditions ( e.g. , temperature , light and humidity ) were similar to natural conditions outdoors .
five larvae of each instar were reared in 2 ml centrifuge tubes .
other larvae were reared in a plastic box ( 18 cm x 11 cm x 12 cm ) with the field - collected rotten wood .
all larvae were fed springtails once a month .
morphological analysis prior to preparing them for microscopy , larvae were drawn by a stereomicroscope olympus szx16 equipped with drawing tube .
one specimen of each instar of eustra chinensis , and the single specimen from taiwan were rehydrated , cleared in 10 % koh , transferred in hot lactic acid , dehydrated through a series of etoh baths of increasing concentration ( 10 - 20 - 50 - 70 - 90 - 95 - 100 %) , left overnight in a clove oil bath , and mounted on slides with canada balsam .
these specimens were studied and illustrated by using a light microscope olympus bx51 equipped with drawing tube .
another first instar specimen was dehydrated through a series of etoh baths of increasing concentration ( 70 - 80 - 90 - 95 - 100 %) , critical point dried ( bal - tec cpd 030 ) , mounted on a stub ( by using self adhesive carbon disks ) , sputtered with gold ( emitech k550 sputter coater ) , and observed with philips xl30 scanning electron microscope and fei dualbeam fib / sem helios nanolab ( l.i.m.e. laboratory , university ' roma tre ' , rome ) .
in this paper , the general terminology of larval structures follows lawrence ( 1991 ) .
notation of primary setae and pores follows the system of bousquet and goulet ( 1984 ) , modified for metrius contractus ( bousquet 1986 ) .
because some of the sensilla on the abdomen and terminal disk of eustra are homologous to those recognized in metrius contractus ( sensilla s - i to s - v ) ( bousquet 1986 ) , pachyteles spp .
( sensilla s - i to s - vii ) ( di giulio et al. 2000 ) , and arthropterus sp .
( sensilla s - i to s - viii ) ( di giulio and moore 2004 ) , we adopt here the same nomenclature used by these authors .
notation of microsculpture follows harris ( 1979 ) .
an asterisk (*) following a coded seta indicates that the homology between the structure on the eustra larvae and the corresponding code is questionable .

only basal part of head capsule , basal half of a mandible , thorax , basal part of legs , entire abdomen and terminal disk are intact .
however , there is one low - resolution image of the entire specimen , which provides only limited information of some structural details .
general larval structure and most characters of the terminal disk ( fig. 6b ) are very similar to those described above , especially as compared with the third instar of eustra chinensis , except for the following minor differences : ( 1 ) lobe a of urogomphi about as long as b ( a much shorter than b in eustra chinensis ) ; ( 2 ) e1a thinner and more elongate than e1b ( subequal or only slightly longer to e1b in eustra chinensis ) ; ( 3 ) lobes a very close medially , almost touching ( distinctly separated medially in eustra chinensis ) .
discussion eustra larvae are highly modified compared with the other known larvae of ozaenini , and have several unique structures that make their identification easy .
these include : 1 .
antennae 3 - jointed ( figs 1c , 2c ) .
paussinae larvae generally show 4 - jointed antennae , a condition typical for adephagans .
the reduction to 3 joints in eustra is clearly due to the fusion of antennomeres ii and iii .
2. mandible apically bidentate with sub - basal retinaculum ( figs 1d , 3b ) .
a bidentate mandibular apex is also present in all known myrmecophilous paussini larvae except arthropterus , but in this tribe the second tooth is thought to be a subapically displaced retinaculum ( di giulio and moore 2004 ) .
in addition to the bidentate apex ( fig. 3b ) , a small subtriangular and basally directed retinaculum is present in eustra first instars , and it becomes longer and more falcate in later instars .
3. ental margin of retinaculum with additional small sub - basal tooth ( fig. 1d ) .
this margin is straight only in physea , while it is more or less sinuate ( basal half convex , distal half concave ) in all other known ozaenine genera .
the presence of a sub - basal tooth on the ental margin in eustra may be an adaptation for piercing and holding their prey .
4. maxillary palp 3 - jointed ( fig. 1e ) .
the reduction of the palpomeres from 4 to 3 is a common feature of known paussini larvae except for platyrhopalopsis and arthropterus .
in the genus paussus the reduction is due to the fusion of basal palpomere with the stipe .
in eustra the basal palpomere is only partially fused with stipe but still recognizable , and the actual reduction is due to the fusion of palpomeres ii + iii .
5. galea extremely long and apically sharp ( figs 1e , 3c ) .
the galea of eustra is two - jointed as is typical of ozaenines but it is highly modified : it is very strong , up - curved , and almost two times longer than the maxillary palp and almost three times longer than the lacinia .
the apex is hook - like and unusually sharp , which would provide an effective tool for capturing and holding prey .
6. strongly asymmetric tarsal claws ( figs 4b , 5b ) .
all metriini , mystropomini , and ozaenini larvae have legs with two tarsal claws of unequal size , the anterior distinctly longer than posterior , while myrmecophilous paussini larvae have only a single claw ( presumably the anterior ) .
in eustra the posterior tarsal claw is extremely small and almost obsolescent .
7. hypopleurite vi with ventrolateral , elongate digitiform protuberance , tipped by strong spine - like seta ( figs 4d , 5d ) .
this peculiar sensorial structure is unique to the genus eustra .
8. most sternal and pleural setae of the abdomen elongate and clavate at apex ( figs 4c - d , 5c - d ) .
clavate sensilla have been described in the myrmecophilous genus arthropterus ( sensilla s - viii possibly homolog to s - ii , see di giulio and moore 2004 ) , which surround the terminal disk , and are also present on the thorax and cephalic capsule .
in eustra , a clavate modification affects most abdominal mechanoreceptors as well as most sensilla of the terminal disk ( see below ) .
in particular , the terminal disk has two types of sensilla , often alternate ( i.e. dorsal plates ) : type 1 is very long , stick - like , and pointed at the apex ; type 2 is short and clavate at the tip .
9. lateral plates of terminal disk transverse , subtriangular and pointed at apex ( figs 6a - b , 7d ) , with straight margins .
the lateral plates of the metriini , mystropomini and other ozaenini are wide and broadly rounded .
lateral plates of goniotropis ( ozaenini ) ( fig. 6c ) are transverse and widely separated from dorsal plates similar to those of eustra .
10. urogomphi flattened , wider and longer than dorsal plates , composed by 7 short triangular lobes ( figs 6a - b , 7a ) , acute or bidentate at apex , separated by v - shaped notches of different depths , very shallowas compared to other ozaenini .
the flattening and widening of the urogomphi and the reduction ( physea , ozaenini ) or absence ( all paussini , see for example fig. 6d ) of branches is a typical feature of myrmecophilous larvae ( di giulio et al. 2003 ; di giulio and moore 2004 ) .
11. absence of urogomphal lobe d and presence of the additional urogomphal lobe x ( figs 6a - b , 7a ) .
the lobes of urogomphi were coded first in metrius by bousquet ( 1986 ) and his notation was later slightly modified for ozaenines to include the partial or total bipartition of lobes b ( b1 + b2 ) and e ( e1 + e2 ) ( vigna taglianti et al. 1998 ) .
this notation works for all described ozaenine larvae except for eustra , which do not have a lobe d , but rather have an additional lobe ( here named " lobe x ") located between lobes c and e2 .
lobe x may be interpreted as : ( 1 ) a unique lobe ( x = f ) ; ( 2 ) d - lobe distally displaced to the margin ( x = d ) ; or ( 3 ) an additional subdivision of lobe e ( x = e3 ) .
eustra larvae also have a unique subdivision of e1 ( e1a , e1b ) .
12. peculiar inflated sensilla s - i ( figs 7a,c,e ) of different lengths present on surface of plates and urogomphi .
inflated sensilla s - i have been described in larvae of platyrhopalopsis ( paussini ) and physea ( ozaenini ) and have been considered as an adaptation to the myrmecophilous lifestyle ( di giulio et al. 2003 ) .
the sensilla s - i of eustra are very different from the homologous structures of the aforementioned taxa since these are mushroom - shaped , composed of an elongate basal stem , which emerges from a cuticular protuberance , and an apical irregular inflation .
like in the other ozaenine genera , larvae of eustra live in galleries that they dig in humid soil or rotten wood and close off with their terminal disk , which they use to trap prey .
however , the larvae of eustra are so specialized and modified that it is not possible to find clear synapomorphies with larvae of any of the other known ozaenine genera .
some of the peculiar adaptations discussed above are similar to , but not necessary homologous to , characteristics described for the myrmecophilous larvae of paussini and physea ( see table 2 ) .
since the eustra larva from taiwan was found inside a nest of pachycondyla javana,it is possible that some of these traits are adaptations to a myrmecophilous lifestyle .
however , we think that it is more likely that these minute larvae feed on very small invertebrates like collembolans and drosophila , which first instar ozaenine larvae consistently consume in the lab ( moore and di giulio , pers .
obs. ) , than it is that they feed on pachycondlya , which are relatively large - bodied ants .
instead , many of the unusual characters observed in these larvae could facilitate feeding on fast moving prey , including the very long radial mechanoreceptors ( sensilla s - ii ) of the terminal disk which would sense the approach of fast collembolans , and modified mouthparts including the bidentate mandibular apex , second tooth of retinaculum , and hook - like galea which would help the larva hold onto motile prey .
other characters , such as the flattening and widening of the urogomphi , could be related to the miniaturization of the larval body .
in the future , we hope to discover the larvae of the genus dhanya , and compare its morphological structures with eustra since they are hypothesized to be sister genera ( jeannel 1946 ; stork 1985 ; deuve 2001 ) , as well as larvae of the species formerly classified in the genus ozaenaphenops to search for support of its synonymy with eustra ( deuve 2001 ) .

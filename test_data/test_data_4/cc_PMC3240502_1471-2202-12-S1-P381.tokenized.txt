however , these correlations were established during skilled arm movements , when the movement ( process ) noise , which affects the controlled movement , is relatively small ( small co - variance matrix ) .
in contrast , given the limited accuracy of bmis , initial operation in brain control results in higher movement noise ( larger co - variance matrix ) .
here we investigate the consequences of this change , and demonstrate that it may explain the changes in neural rate - modulations that accompany the transition from pole control to brain control in bmi experiments [ 1 ] , and in particular the abrupt increase in their variability .
methods given the inherent delays in the sensory - motor system , it is generally assumed that the brain uses internal estimations of the state of the body , and in particular the hand , to control its movement .
optimal state estimation relies on internal prediction of the state , based on an internal model of the system , and on sensory measurements .
the optimal integration of the internal prediction and sensory measurement depends on the relative size of their uncertainties : the measurement noise , which corrupts the measured sensory feedback , and the movement noise , which affects the actual movement and thus the deviation between the predicted and actual states .
thus , the internal estimation of the covariance matrices of these noise - sources affects optimal state estimation .
results using the framework of optimal state estimation , we show theoretically that under wide conditions ( specified in the analysis ) , when the movement noise increases , the estimation process become more variable .
the exact dependence between these two quantities is derived for a simple , 1 degree of freedom system , and compared with simulation results .
neural activity is generated under the assumption that the neurons encode the estimated state , including the estimated position , velocity and speed .
we demonstrate that the modulations of the simulated neurons increases as the movement noise increases .
finally , we simulate brain control by training a bmi filter and using its output to control the cursor .
assuming that the internal estimation of the movement noise is higher in brain control , the simulated neural activity demonstrates the same phenomena observed in the data : the percent neural modulations is higher in brain control without hand movements than in pole control , while the percent task - related modulations does not increase .

correction after publication of the original article [ 1 ] it was brought to the attention of the publishers that several errors were introduced during the typesetting and production process .
in the original article figures six ( figure 1 here ) , seven ( figure 2 here ) and figure eight ( figure 3 ) do not correspond to their legends and some typographical errors were introduced into the legends .
the publishers regret any inconvenience this may have caused .

tir - domain - containing adapter - inducing interferon - beta ( trif ) deficiency attenuates microglial inflammatory factor release .
real - time reverse transcriptase ( rt ) - pcr and elisa results of wild - type ( wt ) and trif - / - microglia pre - stimulated by injured rgcs in a transwell system to identify changes of inflammatory factors .
( a - f ) measured by real - time rt pcr ; ( g - k ) measured by elisa .
( a ) bar graphs showing interferon ( ifn ) - beta mrna expressed in the control , and at 12 , 24 , and 36 hours in wt and trif - / - microglia by real - time rt - pcr .
significant differences were seen at 36 hours in microglia pre - stimulated with injured rgcs .
( b ) interleukin ( il ) - 1beta mrna expressed in the wt and trif - / - groups .
at 12 hours , il - 1beta mrna expression was higher in the trif - / - than in the wt group ; however , at 24 and 36 hours , it was higher in the wt than in the trif - / - group .
( c ) at 24 hours and 36 hours , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha was upregulated to a greater extent in the wt group .
( d ) il - 6 was significantly higher in the wt than in the trif - / - group at 24 and 36 hours .
( e ) il - 17 was upregulated at 36 hours in the wt .
( f ) inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) increased from 12 to 36 hours in the wt. similar to the pcr results , ( g ) ifn - beta release increased markedly at 24 and 36 hours .
( h ) il - 1beta had a greater increase at 24 and 36 hours in the wt than in the trif - / - group ; however , it was lower at 12 hours .
( i ) tnf - alpha concentration was significantly increased in the wt at 24 and 36 hours compared with the trif - / - group .
( j ) il - 6 concentration was significantly increased in the wt at 24 and 36 hours compared with the trif - / - group .
( k ) il - 17 concentration was significantly increased in the wt at 12 , 24 , and 36 hours compared with trif - / - group .
experiments were performed in triplicate .
n = 3 , * p < 0.05 vs. increase relative to the trif - / - group ( wt group at the same time point ) .
beta - actin mrna was used as an internal control .

tir - domain - containing adapter - inducing interferon - beta ( trif ) deficiency attenuates inflammation via tank - binding kinase ( tbk ) 1 / ikappab kinase ( ikk ) epsilon and nuclear factor ( nf ) - kappab signaling .
western blot results for wild - type ( wt ) and trif - / - microglia pre - stimulated by injured retinal ganglion cells ( rgcs ) in a transwell system identifies the signaling changes downstream of trif .
( a ) bar graph showing that tbk1 was upregulated gradually in the wt group ; however , trif - / - effectively suppressed tbk1 from 24 to 36 hours .
( b ) trif - / - effectively suppressed nf - kappab from 12 to 36 hours .
( c ) bar graph showing that trif - / - effectively suppressed ikkepsilon from 12 to 36 hours .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 vs. wt group at the same time point .
beta - actin was used as an internal control .
figure 3 [ updated figure 8 from original manuscript ] .
microglial cells in retinal sections at post - crush days 7 and 14 ( 7dpc and 14dpc ) .
microglia in retinal sections were different between the wt and trif - / - groups at 7dpc and 14dpc .
( a ) in the wt group , microglia were located in the ganglion cell layer ( gcl ) and the inner plexiform layer ( ipl ) .
after stimulation by on injury , more microglia were located in the gcl and ipl , and had a ramified and dotted shape at 7dpc .
more microglia with a dotted shape and short processes were located in the gcl and ipl at 14dpc .
( b ) in the trif - / - group , the microglia located in the gcl and ipl had a ramified shape .
scale bar = 20 mum .
scale bar ( in box ) = 10 mum .
gcl , ganglion cell layer ; ipl , inner plexiform layer .
it was also noticed by the authors that the image they provided for figure four panel c ( figure 4 here ) was incorrect .
the authors apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused .
figure 4 [ updated figure 4 from original manuscript ] .
retinal retinal ganglion cell ( rgc ) survival detected by fluorogold ( fg ) retrograde labeling .
( a ) fg was transported retrograde to rgc soma in a whole - mount retina used as a control. from 7 to 21 days post - crush ( 7dpc to 21dpc , fg - labeled rgcs declined in ( b ) the wt and ( c ) trif - / - groups .
scale bar , 100 mum .
the number of labeled rgcs was analyzed to confirm that more rgcs survived in the trif - / - group than in the wt group ( d ) .
* p < 0.05 vs. wt group .
( e ) survival ratio of rgcs in trif - / - group was higher than that in the wt group from 7dpc to 21dpc .
* p < 0.05 vs. wt group .

a bovine viral diarrhea virus ( bvdv ) , gs5 , of the bvdv - 1a subgenotype was isolated from dairy cattle in gansu province , northwest china .
its near - full - length genome was determined to be closely related to an early belgian bvdv - 1a strain , wax - n , but the relatedness to domestic strains is relatively low , indicating that different genetic evolution occurred between the viral strains in cattle in china .

although under natural conditions , bvdv infects mainly cattle , it has been also isolated from animals other than cattle , including sheep , goats , swine , yaks , deer , and members of the camelidae family ( 1 - 3 ) .
bvdv - 1 is the dominant genotype worldwide , and at least 21 subgenotypes ( bvdv - 1a to bvdv - 1u ) have been proposed ( 4 , 5 ) .
at least 11 subgenotypes of bvdv ( bvdv - 1a to - 1d , bvdv - 1m to - 1q , bvdv - 1u , bvdv - 2a , and bvdv - 2b ) are circulating among multiple domestic animals in china ( 5 - 10 ) .
however , the complete genome of domestic isolates was scarcely reported for the classical subgenotypes except for bvdv - 1b and bvdv - 1d ( 11 - 13 ) .
in this study , the genome of a chinese isolate , gs5 , which belongs to the bvdv - 1a subgenotype , was determined for the first time .
bvdv gs5 in passage cultures was used for viral rna extraction and reverse transcription - pcr ( rt - pcr ) , using primers that were designed based on the sequences of bvdv strain nadl ( genbank accession number aj133739 ) .
the pcr products were purified and sequenced ( sangon biotech , shanghai , china ) .
the near - full - length genome of gs5 is 12,189 nucleotides ( nt ) in length .
flanked by a 277 - nt 5 ' untranslated region ( utr ) and a 215 - nt 3 ' utr ( partially determined ) , the open reading frame ( orf ) is 11,697 nt in length and encodes 3,898 amino acids .
neither a cellular sequence insertion nor duplication of viral protein - coding regions was observed in the viral genome .
blast analysis with the genome sequence revealed that the gs5 strain shared high nucleotide identity ( 88 to 92 %) with the bvdv - 1a strains available in genbank , followed by other subgenotypes of bvdv - 1 ( 80 to 84 %) .
however , it had lower nucleotide identity with strains of bvdv - 2 ( 73 %) and atypical bovine pestiviruses ( 71 %) .
an individual coding region was demonstrated to have the highest nucleotide identity with an early belgian bvdv - 1a strain , wax - n , ranging from 88.6 % to 96.0 % , followed by the north america strain c24v , with 88.6 to 93.9 % nucleotide identity .
the conserved 5 ' utr has 91.1 to 96.0 % identity with reference bvdv - 1a strains , but the similarity is lower ( 69.7 to 88.6 %) than other subgenotypes of bvdv - 1 , bvdv - 2 , and atypical pestiviruses .
the coding nucleotides of the immunodominant envelope protein e2 were analyzed , and gs5 is divergent from early north america strains c24v , sd1 , and nadl , demonstrating 84.5 to 92.5 % nucleotide identity .
compared with domestic bvdv - 1a isolates , gs5 was demonstrated to have nucleotide identity with sh1060 ( 93.6 %) ( genbank accession no. jn248741 ) and hn01 ( 90.8 %) ( genbank accession no .
jx878887 ) in the 5 ' utr , with two camel origin bvdv isolates ( 88.1 % and 87.9 %) ( genbank accession no .
kc207068 and kc207069 ) in the npro coding region , and with gs24 ( 87.1 %) in the e2 coding region ( genbank accession no. kf048838 ) .
the genetic relatedness of gs5 to domestic bvdv strains that were identified recently is comparatively lower than that with the belgian strain wax - n or early north american strains , suggesting that gs5 may share recent common ancestor with early north american strains , indicating different genetic evolution among different bvdv strains in cattle in china .
accession number ( s ) .
the genome sequence of bvdv gs5 has been deposited in genbank under the accession number kj541471 .

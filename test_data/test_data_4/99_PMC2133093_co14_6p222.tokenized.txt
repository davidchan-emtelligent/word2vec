i agree with dr. milgrom that some interesting phenomena have been discovered in the supramolecular modification of water structure and also in molecular semiotics .
however , the link to clinical effects has not been established .
my romantic rationality yearns for these effects to have clinical application .
what clinician or patient would not want negligible toxicity ?
unfortunately , material science data is being fitted retrospectively to a paradigm of homeopathy that has not been proven to result in clinical effects ( over and above placebo ) in the real world ( inductive reasoning ) .
therefore my logical rationality cannot condone this .
misinterpretation is pseudoscience .
the practice of homeopathy encourages expectation and the so - called placebo effect - - and that 's fine .
however , it is nonsense to utilize expensive homeopathic preparations without the proof that the compound itself has an effect in addition to the therapeutic relationship or , indeed , the packaging .
i support individualization of therapies , but this is no excuse for not undertaking a randomized controlled trial , because randomization can be performed after the individualization decision .
regarding funding , if the many companies that profit from the sale of expensive homeopathic remedies were to contribute to research , then the truth would be revealed .
many of the over - the - counter remedies do not individualize , but claim a blanket cure for all .
note that in my editorial , i did not use the metaphor " a spoonful of sugar. " a " teaspoon of honey " leaves open the option that there may be other substances besides sugar that can result in a therapeutic effect .
( honey contains more than sugars. ) however , it is the responsibility of the scientist to authenticate these substances and to prove within the clinical scenario that they contribute more than expectation or the placebo effect .
i am sure that hippocrates is somersaulting in his grave , celebrating the many effective therapies that allopathic medicine has developed for our patients with cancer .
as a humane clinician and a scientist , i support any intervention that benefits our patients , but i do not endorse recommendations that are misleading and not supported by reasonable and rational evidence .
if homeopathy is to advance , it requires deductive reasoning and suitable clinical trials that exclude the powerful effects of expectation alone .
sincerely ,

background hiv - 1 has evolved ways to exploit dcs , thereby facilitating viral dissemination and allowing evasion of antiviral immunity .
recently , the fate of dcs has been found to be extremely dependent on the interaction with autologous nk cells , but the mechanisms by which nk - dc interaction controls viral infections remain unclear .
here , we investigate the impact of nk - dc cross - talk on maturation and functions of hiv - infected immature dcs .
methodology / principal findings immature dcs were derived from primary monocytes , cultured in the presence of il - 4 and gm - csf .
in some experiments , dcs were infected with r5 - hiv - 1bal or x4 - hiv - 1ndk , and viral replication , proviral hiv - dna and the frequency of infected dcs were measured .
autologous nk cells were sorted and either kept unstimulated in the presence of suboptimal concentration of il - 2 , or activated by a combination of pha and il - 2 .
the impact of 24 h nk - dc cross - talk on the fate of hiv - 1 - infected dcs was analyzed .
we report that activated nk cells were required for the induction of maturation of dcs , whether uninfected or hiv - 1 - infected , and this process involved hmgb1 .
however , the cross - talk between hiv - 1 - infected dcs and activated nk cells was functionally defective , as demonstrated by the strong impairment of dcs to induce th1 polarization of naive cd4 t cells .
this was associated with the defective production of il - 12 and il - 18 by infected dcs .
moreover , the crosstalk between activated nk cells and hiv - infected dcs resulted in a dramatic increase in viral replication and proviral dna expression in dcs .
hmgb1 , produced both by nk cells and dcs , was found to play a pivotal role in this process , and inhibition of hmgb1 activity by glycyrrhizin , known to bind specifically to hmgb1 , or blocking anti - hmgb1 antibodies , abrogated nk - dependent hiv - 1 replication in dcs .
conclusion these observations provide evidence for the crucial role of nk - dc cross - talk in promoting viral dissemination , and challenge the question of the in vivo involvement of hmgb1 in the triggering of hiv - 1 replication and replenishment of viral reservoirs in aids .
introduction early stages of hiv - 1 infection are associated with local recruitment and activation of important effectors of innate immunity , nk cells and dcs .
in the first hours and days of mucosal infection , hiv - 1 crosses the epithelial barrier and infects ccr5 - expressing dcs , macrophages and t cells in the mucosal tissues to initiate infection [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
dcs express cd4 , ccr5 , dc - sign [ 3 ] and other c - type lectin receptors ( clrs ) that facilitate capture and dissemination of hiv - 1 [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
immature dcs ( idcs ) capture hiv - 1 through clrs [ 6 ] and captured virus can be internalized and rapidly transmitted to nearby cd4 t cells , in the form of an infectious synapse [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
dc - t cell conjugates facilitate productive infection in cd4 t cells [ 9 ] , and dissemination of the infection to the draining lymph nodes and subsequent other lymphoid tissue compartments is ensured by virus - carrying dcs together with infected macrophages and cd4 t cells [ 10 ] .
migration of idc to t cell area of secondary lymphoid tissues after virus uptake is associated to a maturation process , that allows the resulting mature dc ( mdc ) to prime an antigen - specific response [ 11 ] .
recently , the fate of dcs has been found to be extremely dependent on autologous nk cells [ 12 ] .
nk - idc interaction results in activation of nk cells that , in turn , induces dc maturation or killing , depending on their respective density [ 13 ] - [ 15 ] .
dc undergoing maturation secrete several cytokines , such as il - 12 and il - 18 , that act as potent inducers of nk cell activation and cytotoxicity [ 16 ] - [ 20 ] .
in turn , once activated , nk cells produce ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha , capable of inducing dc maturation .
this phenomenon is dependent on the engagement of nkp30 by ligands expressed on idc [ 17 ] , [ 21 ] , and the down - regulation on idc of hla - e , the ligand for cd94 / nkg2a inhibitory receptor [ 22 ] .
another mechanism was proposed suggesting that nk cells , activated by il - 18 released by idc at the synaptic cleft , secrete hmgb1 , which induces dc maturation and protects dcs from lysis [ 20 ] .
hmgb1 is a nuclear protein that is present in almost all eukaryotic cells , and it functions to stabilize nucleosome formation , and acts as a transcription - factor - like protein that regulates the expression of several genes [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
hmgb1 is released from necrotic cells , but it can also be secreted by activated macrophages [ 25 ] and activated nk cells [ 20 ] in response to inflammatory stimuli , and it is one of the main prototypes of the damage - associated molecular pattern molecules ( damps ) [ 26 ] .
it was recently discovered to be a crucial cytokine in the immune system , facilitating the trafficking of inflammatory leukocytes , and being critical for dcs to mature , reach the lymph nodes and sustain the proliferation of antigen - specific t cells , and to promote their polarization towards a t - helper 1 phenotype [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
the mechanisms involved in nk - dc interaction during viral infections are poorly understood .
it was recently reported in murine cmv ( mcmv ) infection that mcmv - infected dcs were capable of activating syngeneic nk cells in vitro and also capable of enhancing nk - cell dependent clearance in vivo [ 29 ] , demonstrating the crucial role of nk - dc cross - talk in controlling viral replication .
in hiv infection , nk - dc interaction was found defective in hiv - 1 - infected viremic , but not aviremic patients , characterized by abnormalities in the process of reciprocal nk - dc activation and maturation , as well as a defect in nk - cell elimination of idcs [ 30 ] .
we investigated the role of nk - dc cross - talk on maturation , function , and susceptibility to viral replication of hiv - 1 - infected idcs .
we discovered that maturation of hiv - 1 - infected dcs could be triggered by activated nk cells , but it was associated with a strong impairment of mature infected dcs to induce th1 polarization following their cross - talk with nk cells .
in addition , the cross - talk between nk cells and hiv - 1 - infected idcs resulted in a dramatic increase in viral replication and proviral dna expression in dcs .
this process was mainly triggered by hmgb1 , released both by nk cells and dcs , as a consequence of nk - dc cross - talk .
this study provides new insights into how hiv ' hijacks' dcs to promote efficiently viral dissemination .
results activated nk cells induce the maturation of autologous primary immature dendritic cells infected with hiv - 1 to investigate the role of nk cells on dc maturation , we generated monocyte - derived dcs from isolated monocytes and cocultured them with nk cells purified from the same donor .
nk cells were either resting ( rnk ) or activated by a combination of pha and il - 2 ( ank ) .
24 h of coculture of ank cells with autologous immature dc ( idc ) induced either the survival or apoptosis of idcs , dependent on nk - dc ratio , consistent with previous reports [ 14 ] .
indeed , ank - dc ratio of 5:1 induced dc apoptosis , while 1:5 ratio induced dc survival .
( fig. 1a ) .
idcs survival at a nk - dc ratio of 1:5 was associated with their maturation , as shown by the increased coexpression of the maturation markers cd86 and hla - dr ( 72.1 % of cd86brighthla - drbright dcs were induced by ank cells compared to 15.3 % at baseline ) ( fig. 1b ) , a feature of mature dcs .
under the same experimental conditions , rnk cells had a weaker effect on dc maturation , as judged by the proportion of cd86brighthla - drbright dcs ( fig. 1b,e ) .
following infection of idc with hiv - 1bal , nk - dependent maturation of idcs was not altered ( fig. 1b ) , under conditions of productive infection of idcs , measured at day 3 by p24 release in culture supernatant and intracellular staining of idc for p24 ( fig. 1c ) .
investigating the direct effect of hiv - 1 on dc maturation , we found that , at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 10 ng / ml , hiv - 1bal was unable to increase the expression of the maturation markers cd86 and hla - dr , in contrast to lps , used as a positive control as a strong inducer of dc maturation ( fig. 1b,d ) .
data from three representative donors , shown in fig. 1e , confirm the high impact of ank cells on maturation of idc after 24 h of coculture , whatever the infected or uninfected status of idc .
these experiments have all been reproduced with x4 - hiv - 1 and very similar data were obtained ( data not shown ). from these data , we conclude that productively hiv - 1 - infected idcs have maintained a normal susceptibility to maturation induced by nk cells during the nk - dc cross - talk .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003601.g001 figure 1 ank cells induce the maturation of primary immature hiv - 1 - infected dcs .
( a ) idcs , generated from purified cd14 + monocytes in the presence of il - 4 and gm - csf , were cocultured during 24 h with ank cells at different ratios .
dc survival was determined by flow cytometry with the 7 - aad assay .
surviving dcs were identified as 7aad - cd56 - cells .
data represent three independent experiments and values are means +/ - sd .
( b ) ank cells induce the maturation of idcs .
flow cytometry analysis of idcs , which were either infected with hiv - 1bal ( 1 ng / ml of p24 ) for 3 h or uninfected , were incubated with rnk cells or ank cells at a ratio of 1:5 .
co - staining with hla - dr and cd86 specific antibodies allowed the identification of mature dcs ( cd86brighthla - drbright ) .
data from a representative experiment out of three independent experiments are shown .
( c ) the conditions of infection used in this study were those of a productive infection of idcs , as shown at day 3 by a significant p24 detection in culture supernatant of infected idcs and intracellular detection by flow cytometry of p24 in dc targeted by cd40 expression .
experiments were performed on dcs from three independent donors , and values are means +/ - sd .
( d ) hiv - 1 infection does not induce by itself the maturation of idc , as shown by cd86 / hla - dr dual staining of idcs infected with 0.001 to 10 ng / ml p24 hiv - 1bal .
the proportion of mdcs induced by lps ( dc0 ) ( 78.1 % cd86brighthla - drbright ) is shown as a positive control .
( e ) the proportion of mature cd86brighthla - drbright dcs induced in the indicated cocultures of infected or uninfected idcs with either rnk or ank cells are shown .
these experiments have been performed on primary cells from a number of donors , and representative data from three of them are shown .
when indicated , statistical analyses were made with the non - parametric mann - whitney test .

ank - dc cross - talk triggers hmgb1 expression in both nk cells and dcs in order to identify the molecules involved in ank - dependent maturation of idc , we used multianalyte profiling ( map ) to map the key cytokines produced in 24 h culture of idc , nk cells and ank : idc .
idc released low amounts of il - 1beta , il - 6 and il - 12 , and they did not produce il - 10 or tnf - alpha .
following their coculture with ank cells , a proinflammatory cytokine profile was induced , with a high increase in il - 12 secretion , significant levels of tnf - alpha and ifn - gamma , both derived from nk cells , and no production of il - 10 ( fig. 2a ) .
interestingly , high levels of hmgb1 were detected in those culture supernatants , originating both from idc and nk cells , and ank : idc cocultures resulted in a strong enhancement of hmgb1 concentration in culture supernatants ( fig. 2a ) .
we confirmed at the single cell level , by confocal microscopy , that nk cells were able to produce hmgb1 , detected in the nucleus of freshly isolated nk cells ( fig. 2b ) , and further translocated to the cytoplasm in ank cells ( fig. 2c ) .
following 3 h incubation with hiv - 1bal , ank cells showed a strong decrease in hmgb1 expression , detected both in culture supernatants and by confocal microscopy ( fig. 2c ) , possibly due to a direct inhibitory effect of hiv virions on nk cell functions through the binding of gp120 [ 31 ] .
hmgb1 level reached then a level comparable to that of rnk cells ( fig. 2a ) .
we checked that nk cells were not able to replicate hiv - 1 , as shown by the lack of p24 detection in culture supernatant and the lack of intracellular p24 staining ( detected by facs ) in nk cells ( data not shown ) .
hmgb1 was also secreted by idcs and , once infected , they still produced comparable amount of the cytokine in culture supernatants ( fig. 2d ) .
hmgb1 was mostly detected in the cytoplasm of idcs , whether infected by hiv - 1 or not ( fig. 2e ) , and p24 expression in infected dcs did not alter hmgb1 expression , as shown by dual intracellular staining for p24 and hmgb1 ( fig. 2e ) .
when idcs were cocultured with ank cells , a strong induction of hmgb1 secretion in culture supernatants was observed ( fig. 2d ) , reaching levels comparable to those produced by mature dcs , i.e. dc0 , dc1 and dc2 ( fig. 2f ) .
strikingly , hiv - 1 infection of idc did not affect the amount of hmgb1 produced in nk - dc cocultures ( fig. 2d ) and in cultures of mature dcs ( fig. 2f ) .
confocal microscopy analysis showed the formation of conjugates between ank cells and idcs , which were also observed when ank cells were cocultured with hiv - 1 - infected dcs , and both cells expressed hmgb1 , whatever the infected status of dcs ( fig. 2g ) .
these results demonstrate that hmgb1 is expressed both by nk cells and idcs during nk - dc cross - talk , and this process is not altered by hiv - 1 infection of idcs .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003601.g002 figure 2 ank - dc cross - talk triggers hmgb1 expression in both ank cells and dcs .
( a ) 24 h cell - free culture supernatants of idcs , rnk cells , ank cells ( 106 / ml ) , or cocultures of ank cells and idcs ( ratio 1:5 ) were tested for cytokine content .
map technology was used to quantify il - 1beta , il - 6 , il - 10 , tnf - alpha , il - 12 and ifn - gamma , whereas hmgb1 was quantified by elisa .
* p < 0.05 ( non - parametric mann - whitney test ) .
( b ) hmgb1 expression was detected by immunofluorescence ( in red ) in freshly sorted blood nk cells .
counterstaining with dapi ( in blue ) showed the nuclear localisation of hmgb1 .
( c ) incubation of ank cells with hiv - 1 inhibits hmgb1 secretion .
left panel : ank cells ( 106 cells / ml ) were incubated in medium or with hiv - 1bal ( 1 ng / ml of p24 ) for 3 h and tested for hmgb1 production 21 h later .

( d ) hmgb1 production during ank - idc cross - talk is not inhibited by hiv - 1 infection of idcs .
idcs were incubated for 3 h in medium or with hiv - 1bal ( 1 ng / ml of p24 ) and further cocultured for 21 h with ank cells ( ank : idc ratio 1:5 ) .
hmgb1 concentration was then measured in culture supernatants .
data represent the mean +/ - sd of three independent experiments .

upper panel : non infected idcs ; middle panel : hiv - 1 - infected and replicating idcs , as shown by intracellular p24 staining ; lower panel : idcs incubated with hiv - 1 but negative for intracellular p24 expression .
( f ) mature dcs were generated by 48 h stimulation of idcs with lps ( dc0 ) , soluble cd40l ( dc1 ) or lps + pge2 ( dc2 ) .
dc0 , dc1 and dc2 were incubated for 3 h in medium or infected with hiv - 1bal ( 1 ng / ml of p24 ) and further incubated in medium for 21 h .
hmgb1 quantification in culture supernatants was performed .
the mean +/ - sd of three independent experiments is shown .
( g ) immunofluorescence analysis of hmgb1 expression in conjugates of ank cells and uninfected ( upper panel ) or hiv - 1 - infected dcs ( lower panel ) in a 24 h coculture .
dcs are dc - sign + and both ank cells and dcs express hmgb1 in these conjugates .
pictures from one representative experiment out of three conducted with different primary cell preparations are shown .
ank - dependent maturation of hiv - 1 - infected idcs is mediated by hmgb1 and involves rage to determine the possible involvement of hmgb1 in nk - dependent dc maturation , we used glycyrrhizin , known to interact specifically with soluble hmgb1 molecule [ 32 ] , and anti - hmgb1 antibodies ( fig. 3a ) .
these inhibitors , added at the initiation of the 24 h ank - idc coculture , reduced the proportions of mature dcs ( identified as cd86brighthla - drbright ) to the baseline level observed without ank cells ( fig. 3a ) .
similar effect was obtained with infected dcs ( fig. 3a ) .
rh - hmgb1 by itself did not induce phenotypic maturation of idc , when treated for 24 h with 1 to 10 microg / ml rh - hmgb1 , and similar data were obtained at 48 h of culture ( fig. 3b ) .
indeed , while spontaneous maturation of idcs was observed after 48 h of culture in medium , as shown by the high percentage of cd86bright hla - drbright dcs , 10 microg / ml rh - hmgb1 only weakly increased from 65 % to 71 % the percentage of these cells .
interestingly , rh - hmgb1 - treated dcs were not fully mature , as assessed by the lack of expression of cd80 , cd83 and the weak expression of dc - lamp , all fully expressed in mdc ( dc0 ) ( fig. 3b ) .
however , these partially mature dcs were functionally susceptible to rh - hmgb1 as shown by the increased release of the chemokines , mcp1 , mip - 1alpha , mip - 1beta and il - 8 by hr - hmgb1 - treated dcs ( fig. 3c ) .
hmgb1 receptors include rage [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] tlr - 2 and tlr - 4 [ 35 ] .
rage was the first identified receptor for hmgb1 , it is expressed by a variety of immune cells including t cells , monocytes , macrophages and dcs [ 36 ] , and it is used by maturing dcs for in vivo homing to lymph nodes [ 37 ] .
while tlr - 2 and tlr - 4 were hardly detected on idc ( not shown ) , rage was fully expressed on dcs , as shown by flow - cytometry , and its expression was even higher on mature dc0 ( fig. 3d ) .
following incubation of idcs with 1 microg / ml of hmgb1 , down - regulation of rage was observed , strongly suggesting that this receptor was used by these cells ( fig. 3d ) .
following dc infection with hiv - 1bal , no change in rage levels was detected on idc and dc0 .
incubation of infected dcs with hmgb1 induced similar down - regulation of rage ( fig. 3d ) .
the possible involvement of rage during nk - dc cross - talk was evaluated with the same approach , comparing rage expression on dcs cocultured with ank cells and dc cultured alone .
after 2 h of coculture with ank cells , dcs showed an up - regulation of rage expression , followed by a down - regulation at 24 h ( fig. 3e ) .
very similar observations were made with hiv - 1 - infected dcs ( fig. 3e ) .
thus , hmgb1 is an important factor for the maturation of both uninfected and hiv - 1 - infected idcs during nk - dc cross talk , and it involves rage , whose expression on idc is not altered following their productive infection .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003601.g003 figure 3 ank - dependent maturation of hiv - 1 - infected idcs is mediated by hmgb1 and involoves rage .
( a ) left panel : idcs were cultured for 24 h either alone or with ank cells , in the presence of blocking anti - hmgb1 antibodies ( 10 microg / ml ) or glycyrrhizin ( 10 microg / ml ) .
the maturation status of dcs was determined by flow cytometry with cd86 and hla - dr - specific antibodies .
right panel : same experiment , but performed with hiv - 1 infected idcs .
data represent mean +/ - sd of at least three independent experiments , and statistical comparisons were made with the non - parametric mann - whitney test .
* p < 0.05 .
( b ) idc ( 106 cells / ml ) were cultured for 48 h with increasing concentrations ( 1 - 10 microg / ml ) of rh - hmgb1 .
cells were then stained with anti - cd86 , - hla - dr , - cd80 , - cd83 , dc - lamp and - cd40 antibodies and analysed by flow cytometry .
( c ) influence of rh - hmgb1 on cytokine and chemokine production ( determined by map ) by dcs .
idcs ( 106 cells / ml ) were incubated for 48 h in medium or in presence of rh - hmgb1 ( 1 or 10 microg / ml ) .
as a positive control , idcs were stimulated with lps ( dc0 ) .
( d ) flow cytometry detection of surface expression of rage by idcs , dc0 , or idcs incubated with rh - hmgb1 ( 1 microg / ml ) .
idcs were either non infected or infected with hiv - 1bal ( 1 ng / ml p24 for 3 h ) .
( e ) idc , dc0 , uninfected or hiv - 1 - infected idc cocultured for 24 h with ank cells , were incubated with rh - hmgb1 ( 1 microg / ml ) and subsequently stained with anti - rage antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry .
nk cells were excluded from the analysis through the co - staining with cd3 - and cd56 - specific antibodies ( cd3 - cd56 +) .
impairment of th1 polarization by hiv - infected dcs as a consequence of a defective nk - dc cross - talk it has been shown that the interaction of nk cells with idcs results in the induction of type - 1 polarized dcs that serve as carriers of the nk cell - derived help for the induction of th1 responses [ 38 ] .
to assess the capacity of dcs , whether infected or uninfected , to polarize a th1 response following their cross - talk with ank cells , naive cd4 + cd45ro - t cells were cocultured for 8 days in the presence of dcs and ank cells , and th1 polarization was determined by the detection in t cells of the intracellular production of ifn - gamma and il - 4 , measured by facs ( fig. 4a ) .
coculture of naive t cells with idcs did not increase the proportion of ifn - gamma positive t cells , and similar data were obtained in coculture of naive t cells with idcs and rnk cells .
in contrast , cocultures of naive t cells with idc in the presence of ank cells induced a significant increase of ifn - gamma t cell response ( fig. 4b ) , suggesting that ank : idc cross - talk is essential for th1 polarization .
when the same experiment was performed with hiv - 1bal - infected dc , no th1 polarization was observed ( fig. 4c ) .
the contribution of hiv - 1 replication to the inhibition of th1 polarization was shown by the addition of azt , which restored the increased ifn - gamma t cell response induced by infected dcs cocultured with ank cells ( fig. 4d ) .
we used azt at a concentration inhibiting viral replication in these conditions , as assessed by the dosage of p24 antigen in the supernatants ( data not shown ) .
il - 12 and il - 18 are critical cytokines produced by dcs and involved in th1 polarization .
we therefore addressed the question of the impact of ank - dc cross - talk on the release of these cytokines by dcs .
we found that ank - dc cross talk triggers both il - 12 and il - 18 secretion by non infected dcs .
importantly , the production of both cytokines was not detected anymore in cocultures of ank cells and infected dcs ( fig. 4e , f ) .
in addition , the triggering of ifn - gamma production by nk cells during ank - dc cross talk was not detected anymore when the coculture was performed with hiv - 1 infected dc ( fig. 4g ) .
thus , the priming of dcs for th1 polarization occurs during ank - idc cross - talk , though the induction of cytokines such as il - 12 and il - 18 released by dcs , and ifn - gamma released by nk cells .
following their infection with hiv - 1 , idcs cannot be polarized anymore by ank cells , due to a defective nk - dc cross - talk .
consequently hiv - 1 infected dcs are impaired in their capacity to induce th1 polarization .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003601.g004 figure 4 impairment of nk - triggered th1 polarization by dcs following hiv - 1 infection is associated to altered il - 12 and il - 18 production .
( a ) th1 polarization by dcs triggered by nk cells was tested by incubating idc ( 106 / ml ) for 30 mn in the presence of rnk or ank cells ( 2x105 / ml ) .
naive cd4 t cells ( 106 / ml ) were added to the cocultures and the frequency of t cells producing ifn - gamma or il - 4 was determined by flow cytometry 8 days later .
the experiment was performed with either uninfected idcs ( b ) idcs infected with hiv - 1bal ( c ) , or idc infected with hiv - 1bal in the presence of azt ( 1 mm ) ( d ) .
culture supernatants of indicated cultures were tested for il - 12 ( e ) , il - 18 ( f ) , and ifn - g ( g ) content .
data represent the mean +/ - sd of five independent experiments .
statistical comparisons were made with the non - parametric mann - whitney test .

pivotal role of hmgb1 in nk - dc dependent triggering of hiv - 1 replication and persistence in idcs since we showed that the impairment of th1 polarization by nk - sensitized hiv - 1 - infected dcs was dependent on hiv - 1 replication ( fig. 4d ) , we tested whether ank - idc interaction could trigger hiv - 1 replication in dcs .
idcs were infected for 3 h with r5 - or x4 - hiv - 1 ( 1 ng / ml of p24 ) and further cultured either alone or in the presence of rnk or ank for 18 h , and the frequency of dcs with intracellular expression of p24 was determined by flow cytometry .
while the percentage of p24 + dcs was quite low when hiv - infected idcs were cultured alone , it significantly increased following their interaction with ank cells , the p24 + dcs representing almost one third of all dcs as compared to only 4 % in the absence of nk cells ( fig. 5a ) .
under the same conditions , rnk cells had no effect on hiv replication in idcs ( fig. 5a ) .
ank - dependent increased hiv replication in infected dcs was confirmed by p24 antigen detection in culture supernatants , and a statistically significant increase of p24 production was detected in cocultures of ank with hiv - 1 - idc as compared to infected idcs cultured alone or with rnk cells ( fig. 5b ) .
the dramatic effect of nk - dc interaction on the frequency of p24 - expressing dcs was confirmed by confocal microscopy with p24 - specific antibodies .
while very rare dcs were stained for intracellular p24 on the day following their infection , a high number of p24 + dc were observed after their culture with ank cells ( fig. 5c ) .
interestingly , the positive influence of ank cells on hiv replication in idcs was similarly observed on mature dcs .
an increased frequency of p24 + dcs , detected by facs , was found in hiv - 1 - infected dc0 cocultured during 24 h with ank cells as compared to dc0 cultured alone ( fig. 5d ) , and p24 detection in culture supernatants from hiv - 1 - infected mature dc0 , dc1 and dc2 cocultured with ank cells , confirmed the significant stimulating effect of ank cells on hiv - 1 replication in mature dcs .
this was observed whether dcs were infected with x4 - or r5 - hiv - 1 ) ( fig. 5f and 5g ). of note , rnk cells had a weak impact on hiv - 1 replication in mature infected - dcs ( fig. 5f and 5g ) .
we then tested whether ank cells had an influence on the expression of proviral dna in idcs .
data in figure 5e show that a very high increase in the number of hiv - 1 proviral dna copies was detected in cultures of infected idcs with ank cells , as compared with that of infected idcs with rnk cells or infected idcs alone .

exogenous hmgb1 was recently reported to increase hiv - 1 replication in infected monocytic cell lines [ 39 ] , and to induce in vitro the reactivation of hiv - 1 in pbmcs from hiv - 1 - infected patients under antiretroviral therapy [ 40 ] .
therefore , we addressed the question of the role of hmgb1 in the nk - dependent triggering of hiv replication in dcs .
we found that exogenous rh - hmgb1 had a direct effect on hiv - 1bal - infected idc , enhancing dramatically the production of p24 in culture supernatants ( fig. 6a ) .
rh - hmgb1 had also a significant stimulatory effect on p24 production by hiv - 1 - infected idc cocultured with a nk cells ( fig. 6a ) .
to investigate the influence of hmgb1 in the triggering of hiv - 1 replication in infected - idc - ank cocultures , hmgb1 - specific neutralizing antibodies or glycyrrhizin were added to these cocultures and p24 production was measured in the supernatant .
both hmgb1 inhibitors abrogated hiv - 1 production by infected dc cocultured with ank cells or cultured alone ( fig. 6b ) .
these results indicate that exogenous hmgb1 is able to trigger hiv - 1 replication by infected idc .
they also indicate that ank cell - dependent stimulation of hiv - 1 replication in idcs is mediated by hmgb1 .

discussion although direct infection of dcs is less efficient than infection of cd4 + t cells [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] an increasing amount of evidence indicates that long - term hiv transmission that is mediated by dcs depends on viral production by the dcs [ 43 ] - [ 45 ] , and hiv - infected dcs in vivo might function as viral reservoirs during migration to the lymphoid tissues , thereby helping to spread viral infection .
here we have shown for the first time that activated nk cells stimulate hiv - 1 replication in dcs and thus might contribute to the establishment of viral reservoirs in these cells .
we demonstrated the nk - cell activating capacity of hiv - 1 - infected idcs and the crucial involvement of hmgb1 , produced during ank - idc cross - talk , in the stimulation of hiv - 1 replication and proviral dna expression in dcs .
we also showed a strong impairment of mature infected dcs to induce th1 polarization following their cross - talk with nk cells .
our observations reveal novel hiv strategies to promote efficiently viral dissemination and escape the immune system .
interaction of nk cells with autologous idcs results in reciprocal activation , and this interaction seems crucial in the initiation / amplification of the early phases of an immune response , before t cells are generated [ 11 ] .
nk cells trigger idcs to mature , and this occurs through an hmgb1 - dependent mechanism [ 20 ] .
nk - dependent maturation of idcs was reported to involve a functional polarization of dcs , with increase in intracellular free ca2 + concentration , cytoskeleton rearrangement , accumulation of secretory lysosomes at the nk / dc synapse , and regulated expression of il - 18 toward the interacting nk cells .
in turn , nk cells secrete large amounts of hmgb1 , which induces maturation of dcs [ 20 ] .
here , we confirm the involvement of hmgb1 in nk - dependent dc maturation during nk - dc contact , as shown by the inhibitory effect of anti - hmgb1 antibodies or glycyrrhizin , known to interact specifically with hmgb1 [ 32 ] .
confocal microscopy analyses and hmgb1 detection in cell - free culture supernatants demonstrated that hmgb1 was not only expressed and secreted by primary nk cells , as reported [ 20 ] , but it was also produced by isolated dcs , the level of hmgb1 release being linked to their maturation stage .
an extremely high level of hmgb1 was detected when idcs where put in contact with ank cells , similar to the one released by mature dcs .
interestingly , confocal microscopy analysis of nk - dc conjugates showed that both cells expressed the cytokine .
hmgb1 receptor , rage , was found rapidly induced following dc interaction with ank cells , and was further down - regulated , compatible with the implication of hmgb1 in nk - dependent dc maturation .
in addition to contributing to dc maturation , hmgb1 has been shown to act as a chemoattractant on idcs [ 46 ] , and to be also required for migration of mature dcs in response to ccr7 and ccr4 ligands [ 47 ] , both activities being mediated by rage [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] .
thus hmgb1 acts as an alarmin , having activating and chemotactic effects on dcs , and stimulating then the migration of dcs from inflamed tissues to the draining lymph nodes [ 46 ] .
these properties of hmgb1 have to be taken into consideration in the context of an uncontrolled viral infection , such as that induced by hiv .
productive infection of idcs with r5 or x4 strains of hiv - 1 preserved nk - dependent phenotypic dc maturation , as shown by the frequency of cd86brighthla - drbright dcs , while hiv itself did n't induce dc maturation in the range of p24 concentrations used ( 0.001 to 10 ng / ml ) .
however , the consequence of ank - dc interaction was a significant enhancement of hiv - 1 infection in idcs .
this was shown by several means , indicating an increased frequency of p24 + dc , associated with a significant enhancement of p24 release in nk - dc culture supernatant , and this was confirmed by immunofluorescence at the single cell level .
moreover , nk - dc cross - talk resulted in a dramatic increase in hiv - 1 dna expression in dcs .
considering the crucial role of hmgb1 during the reciprocal activation of dcs and nk cells , we evaluated its contribution to the triggering of hiv - 1 replication in idcs with blocking anti - hmgb1 antibodies or glycyrrhizin .
the strong blocking effect of these inhibitors on p24 release indicates the involvement of hmgb1 in the process .
it is noteworthy that both inhibitors also decreased significantly hiv - 1 replication in 24 h cultures of infected idcs , in the absence of nk cells .
this is likely due to the spontaneous release of hmgb1 by idc , shown here and previously reported [ 47 ] , which was preserved following their infection with hiv - 1 .
these observations reveal a pivotal role for hmgb1 in controlling hiv - 1 replication in dcs .
as a corollary , we demonstrated that rh - hmgb1 significantly increased p24 release in culture supernatants of infected dcs and of ank - infected dc cocultures .
these data may have important implications in the understanding of hiv pathogenesis , since plasma hmgb1 levels were found elevated in chronically hiv - 1 - infected patients , with the highest concentrations in patients with clinical complications [ 48 ] .
moreover , exogenous hmgb1 was reported to induce in vitro the reactivation of hiv - 1 in pbmcs from hiv - 1 - infected patients under antiretroviral therapy [ 40 ] .
secreted hmgb1 is necessary for proliferation , survival , and polarization of naive cd4 t cells after activation by allogeneic dcs , and these effects involve rage expressed by dcs [ 49 ] .
here , we show that , in syngeneic conditions , hmgb1 was not able by itself to induce th1 polarization .
indeed , no th1 response was induced in the presence of hiv - 1 - infected dcs , though they continued to produce normal levels of hmgb1 , while being inhibited in the release of il - 12 and il - 18 .
recent studies highlighted the essential role of nk cells in the modulation of th1 polarization , suggesting that they trigger il - 12 and il - 18 release by dcs , promoting the production of ifn - gamma by nk cells that in turn trigger the differentiation of t cells towards th1 cells [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] .
the essential role of il - 12 and il - 18 on th1 differentiation is confirmed here , since the defect of hiv - 1 infected dcs to produce increased amount of il - 12 and il - 18 in response to nk cell activation was associated with a defective th1 polarization .
this defect was directly linked to hiv - 1 replication in dcs , as shown by the positive effect of the hiv inhibitor azt .
these observations suggest that some of the functional alterations reported in dcs from hiv - infected patients [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] , such as a decreased secretion of several cytokines , including il - 12 , and an impaired ability to prime autologous cd4 t cells , may be linked to a defective nk - dc cross - talk , as suggested recently [ 30 ] .
alteration of nk : dc cross may also lead to a defect in nk - cell elimination of idcs , as reported in chronically hiv - infected patients [ 30 ] and associated with the resistance of hiv - infected dcs to apoptosis induced by nk cells ( melki mt , saidi h , gougeon ml , submitted to publication ) .
in summary , we have shown that activation of hiv - 1 replication and the possible establishment of viral reservoirs in hiv - 1 - infected dcs is dependent on a cross - talk between ank cells and autologous dcs .
we have identified the pivotal role of hmgb1 in this process , produced both by nk cells and dcs during their cross - talk , and showed that nk - dependent triggering of hiv replication in dcs is completely abrogated by glycyrrhizin , which binds specifically to hmgb1 , or blocking anti - hmgb1 antibodies .
in addition , our data indicate a strong impairment of hiv - 1 - infected dcs to induce th1 polarization following their cross - talk with nk cells .
these observations provide evidence of the crucial role of nk - dc cross - talk in promoting viral dissemination , and challenges the question of the in vivo involvement of hmgb1 in the triggering of viral replication and replenishment of viral reservoirs .

awareness increases that the tumor biology influences treatment outcome and prognosis in cancer .
tumor hypoxia is thought to decrease sensitivity to radiotherapy and some forms of chemotherapy .
presence of hypoxia may be assessed by investigating expression of endogenous markers of hypoxia ( emh ) using immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) .
in this systematic review we investigated the effect of emh expression on local control and survival according to treatment modality in head and neck cancer ( head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [ hnscc ]) .
a search was performed in medline and embase .
studies were eligible for inclusion that described emh expression in relation to outcome in hnscc patients .
quality was assessed using the quality in prognosis studies ( quips ) tool .
hazard ratios for locoregional control and survival were extracted .
forty studies of adequate quality were included .
hif - 1a , hif - 2a , ca - ix , glut - 1 , and opn were identified as the best described emhs. with exception of hif - 2a , all emhs were significantly related to adverse outcome in multiple studies , especially in studies where patients underwent single - modality treatment .
positive expression was often correlated with adverse clinical characteristics , including disease stage and differentiation grade .
in summary , emh expression was common in hnscc patients and negatively influenced their prognosis .
future studies should investigate the effect of hypoxia - modified treatment schedules in patients with high in summary , emh expression .
these may include arcon , treatment with nimorazole , or novel targeted therapies directed at hypoxic tissue .
also , the feasibility of surgical removal of the hypoxic tumor volume prior to radiotherapy should be investigated .
head and neck neoplasms hypoxia hypoxia - inducible factor 1 personalized medicine tumor microenvironment introduction despite improvement of surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques , as well as the introduction of systemic therapies including cisplatin or cetuximab , 5 - year survival rates for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) remain low 1 .
currently , staging and treatment selection is based only on clinical staging using the ajcc tnm - classification .
however , awareness increases that not all squamous cell carcinomas are the same , but have different tumor biology 2 .
these differences could have an even greater impact on treatment outcome than mere clinical staging .
an example is infection with the human papillomavirus ( hpv ) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( opscc ) : hpv - associated ( hpv +) opscc cancers show a much better response to radio - and chemotherapy than non - hpv - associated ( hpv - ) opscc 3,4 .
in this line there is a clear need for other novel biomarkers to predict sensitivity to a particular treatment modality , or to identify which patients might benefit from adjuvant therapies .
one possible target or prognosticator is tumor hypoxia .
hypoxia is defined as a mismatch between cellular oxygen demand and supply .
the causes of hypoxia can roughly be divided into two categories : acute or chronic hypoxia .
acute , or perfusion - limited , hypoxia , occurs when there is insufficient oxygen supply to cells due to compromise of the supplying blood vessels .
acute hypoxia causes electrolyte imbalances and an increase in intracellular hydrogen sulfide .
when this occurs in specialized hypoxia - sensing cells , such as glomus or smooth muscle cells , this leads to a systemic response , such as vasodilation 5 .
in contrast , chronic hypoxia triggers a cellular response in individual cells only after several hours of hypoxia 6 .
chronic hypoxia is often caused by diffusion - limitations which occur when the distance from a cell to the nearest blood vessel is too large for adequate cellular oxygenation 7 .
because of expansive tumor growth , chronic hypoxia often occurs in solid tumors , including hnscc 8 .
hnscc is often treated with radiotherapy which depends on oxygen for free radical formation to induce dna strand breaks and cell death .
because of the need for oxygen , tumor hypoxia causes decreased sensitivity to radiotherapy .
separately , hypoxia is thought to induce tumor progression and a more aggressive phenotype 9 .
therefore , the hypoxic status of a tumor could possibly contribute in identifying the treatment option that offers the best prognosis to an individual patient .
for example , surgical removal of the hypoxic component before radiotherapy might be preferable above radiotherapy alone , when reduced sensitivity to primary radiotherapy is expected .
alternatively , hypoxia - sensitizing radiotherapy schedules such as accelerated radiotherapy with carbogen - breathing and nicotinamide ( arcon ) or addition of a hypoxia - sensitizing drug like nimorazole may be considered 10,11 .
several ways of assessing tumor hypoxia have been described 12 .
this includes the invasive eppendorf po2 histography , that uses polarographic needles to measure tissue po2 in vivo .
tissue biomarkers for hypoxia may also be used to assess tumor hypoxia histologically .
the use of exogenous biomarkers , for instance of the nitroimidazole class , is also invasive , as they have to be administered to patients intravenously before excision of the tissue .
finally , various endogenous biomarkers for hypoxia ( emhs ) exist , that can be used to assess the hypoxic state using ihc , with no need for additional invasive procedures other than routine diagnostic biopsy .
the most important endogenous biomarkers are part of the hypoxia - inducible factor 1 ( hif ) - 1 pathway .
hif - 1 is upregulated under hypoxia to improve cellular survival in a hypoxic microenvironment .
this basic helix - loop - helix transcription factor consists of an alpha ( hif - 1a ) and beta ( hif - 1b or arnt ) subunit .
both are constitutively expressed , but under normoxic conditions hif - 1a is quickly degraded by hydroxylation and binding to the vhl protein 13,14 .
in the hypoxic state , hydroxylation of hif - 1a is inhibited , causing stabilization , enabling interaction with hif - 1b and increased transcription of its downstream targets .
another emh is osteopontin ( opn ) , which is expressed independently of hif - 1a and is involved in the adhesive cell - matrix interaction and is considered a protein involved in tumor development and progression 15,16 .
a brief review of the studied emhs is shown in box box 1 .
box 1 endogenous markers of hypoxia biomarker role hif - 1a hif - 1alpha is the alpha subunit of the hif - 1 transcription factor , which is part of the cellular defense mechanisms to survive in a hypoxic state .
under normoxic conditions it is quickly degraded by prolyl hydroxylase ( phd ) 1 - 3 .
under hypoxic conditions , phd activity is inhibited , causing overexpression of hif - 1a .
as a transcription factor , hif - 1 stabilization causes increased transcription of its downstream targets through hypoxia - responsive elements ( hre ) in the dna hif - 2a hif - 2alpha is also a transcription factor in the hif family , but has distinct other downstream targets .
hif - 2a stabilization under hypoxia occurs through the same mechanism as hif - 1a ca - ix as hypoxic cells rely on anaerobic metabolism , intracellular ph will drop because of lactate formation .
carbonic anhydrase ( ca ) ix is a downstream target of hif - 1 involved in ph regulation 85 .
glut - 1 a downstream target of hif - 1a .
in hypoxic conditions , additional glucose is required for the anaerobic metabolism .
there are many members in the glucose transporter ( glut - ) family , but glut - 1 is specifically upregulated by hif - 1a opn osteopontin ( opn ) is an integrin - binding protein of the sibling family ( small integrin - binding ligand n - linked glycoprotein ) and was first discovered in bone tissue .
it promotes cellular survival through the nf - kappabeta pathway by reducing cell peroxide levels 86 .
it is upregulated independent of hif - 1a under hypoxia hif - 1 , hypoxia - inducible factor 1 .
several ( narrative ) reviews are currently available on the effect of hif - 1a expression on local control and survival in patients with hnscc .
however , to our knowledge , no systematic reviews have studied emh expression from a clinical approach , by systematically comparing the effect of all emhs according to treatment outcome and taking into account differences between subsites .
in the present study , we investigate which biomarkers are used to determine tumor hypoxia in hnscc , as well as the effect of overexpression on clinical outcome .
methods search strategy a systematic review was performed in pubmed / medline and embase .
the search strategy is shown in table s1 .
briefly , a search was performed for studies that described the domain (" hnscc ") and the determinant (" hypoxia "/ emhs ) or synonyms of these terms in the title or abstract or as mesh terms .
the medline gene database was used to identify synonyms of the various emhs .
abstracts were screened based on predetermined in - and exclusion criteria by two authors independently ( fig.1 ) .
full - text analysis of potentially relevant abstracts was performed and a final selection was made .
at all stages , differences were resolved by discussion .
the review was limited to emhs that were studied in more than two articles .
figure 1 study selection process .
study selection flowchart. of the 66 suitable papers , 38 were found of adequate quality .
a citation check yielded three additional results , of which two were of adequate quality .
in total , 40 studies were included .
relevant full text papers were appraised for risk of bias using the quality in prognosis studies ( quips ) tool , that has been developed for systematic appraisal in studies of prognostic factors 17 .
using quips , a risk of bias is determined , based on the study design and the reported results .
for each of the six domains within quips , the risk of bias was judged low ( 0 points ) , moderate ( 1 point ) or high ( 2 points ) , based on three to seven predefined criteria per domain .
for the current review , the following criteria were used : the source population should consist of a consecutive cohort of patients .
baseline characteristics should include t - and n - staging , as well as the treatment modality .
studies disclosing loss to follow - up and that confirmed whether censored patients were known to be alive at the moment of analysis were valued highest in the " study attrition " appraisal .
in the correction for confounding appraisal , studies that investigated potential confounding effects of t - and n - staging , as well as treatment modality were valued highest .
finally , studies that scored a low risk of bias (<= 3 ) were included .
data extraction and meta - analysis extracted data included number of patients , disease stage , tumor subsite , treatment , biomarkers , and corresponding cutoffs and outcome .
the studied outcomes were the hazard ratios ( hr ) for locoregional control ( lrc ) , overall survival ( os ) , disease - free survival ( dfs ) and disease - specific survival ( dss ) .
if a hr was not described , but a kaplan - meier curve was available , the curve was digitized using the open - source engauge digitizer software ( http :// digitizer.sourceforce.net ) and a univariate hr was estimated through the methods of tierney et al .
18. meta - analysis was considered only if studies used the same cutoff values for emh positivity and described patient cohorts were comparable in terms of treatment and disease stage .
a review protocol was not previously published .
results are presented in accordance with the prisma statement for systematic reviews 19 .
results study selection the search in embase and pubmed yielded 4684 unique publications .
abstract screening yielded 138 potentially interesting papers , of which the full text was requested. of these papers , 17 were not in english , dutch or german , 19 were conference abstracts with no full text paper available and 36 were excluded for various reasons of mismatch with the domain , determinant , or outcome .
sixty - six papers remained for critical appraisal .
relevant reviews were read , references were screened and a citation check was performed using web of science .
this yielded three additional papers .
the study selection process is shown in figure1 .
critical appraisal using the quips criteria , the 66 and 3 papers identified through the search and citation checks , respectively , were appraised ( table1 for included studies , table s2 for excluded studies ) .
in many papers it was not described whether the cohort was consecutive .
also , loss to follow - up and the characteristics of patients lost to follow - up were rarely reported , resulting in a high risk of bias in the " study attrition " domain .
many studies used data - dependent cutoffs for their prognostic factor assessment , scoring lower on the " prognostic factor " domain .
also , the treatment modality was often not included in multivariate analysis .
as the effect of hypoxia might be different for each treatment modality ( e.g. , surgery , radiotherapy , or chemoradiation [ crt ]) , these papers scored a higher risk of bias in the " confounding " domain , except when the cohort received uniform treatment .
a score was calculated as described before , however , the study attrition score was omitted in this final risk of bias score .
forty papers remained for final analysis .

the emhs that were described in each study are shown with a filled dot ( example of filled dot ) .
endogenous markers of hypoxia the included studies described the effect of emh expression across all subsites in the head and neck area .
however , many studies analyzed different staining patterns , methods , and cutoff values to define emh positivity .
for instance , some studies used an h - score that combined staining proportion and intensity , while others only scored staining proportion or intensity .
because of this heterogeneity , it was deemed that data pooling and subsequent meta - analysis were not appropriate , as this might introduce bias .
emh expression was often correlated with adverse clinical parameters , such as t - stage , n - stage , or differentiation grade , as shown in tables2 through 7 .
the effect of emh expression is discussed per treatment strategy , as hypoxia may influence outcome of various treatment strategies differently .
as a summary , a forest plot for os across all treatment strategies is shown in figure2 .

emh , endogenous markers of hypoxia .
primary radiotherapy or arcon eleven studies were identified that studied the clinical effect of emhs in patients treated with radiotherapy ( xrt ) or the hypoxia - sensitizing treatment of accelerated radiotherapy , in combination with carbogen gas breathing and intravenously administered nicotinamide ( arcon ) 20 - 30 .
results are summarized in table2 .
most studies identified a worse outcome in patients with high emh expression .
this finding appears to be present across all subsites within the head and neck region , including the oropharynx 20,21 , the larynx 23,25 , and the nasopharynx 28 , as well as in a study that analyzed patients with cancers of several subsites 29 .
in this last study multiple biomarkers of hypoxia were studied .
hif - 1a expression predicted significantly worse lrc .
while lrc was lower in patients with high expression of ca - ix and opn , this did not reach statistical significance .

the study of rademakers et al .
24 of 261 patients randomized between treatment with xrt or arcon did not find better os in low ca - ix expressing laryngeal cancer patients ( lscc ) .
unfortunately , no separate data were presented for xrt and arcon .
the authors did report differences in os between different staining patterns : a perinecrotic staining pattern , in which cells stain more strongly as the distance to the nearest blood vessel increases , was associated with worse os ( p < 0.01 ) and lrc ( p = 0.01 ) when compared to diffuse or no expression of ca - ix. surprisingly , in the study of jonathan et al .
30 of 58 hnscc patients treated only with arcon , a better outcome was observed in patients with high emh expression .
in this small study , ca - ix expression was mostly low .
using a cutoff at the median value of expression , the authors describe no significant correlation with the outcome .
finally , the 80th percentile ( 25 % membranous expression ) was used as a cutoff value that found a significantly better outcome for patients with high ca - ix levels .

9 expression was scored as negative , weak or strong by a single pathologist .
discussion in this systematic review , we investigated expression of biomarkers for tumor hypoxia in relation to clinical outcome and treatment strategy .
we identified 40 high - quality studies .
emh expression was common and associated to worse survival or lrc in most studies , although statistical significance was not always reached .
in addition , emh expression was often correlated with worse clinicopathological characteristics .
surprisingly , three studies found emh expression to be associated to better outcome , but these mostly had a small sample size 30,39,49 .
moreover , in studies that investigated multiple emhs , high hif - 1a expression was often associated with worse outcome , while this was not always true for the other emhs .
chronic hypoxia is an important and highly prevalent problem in solid tumors 9 .
we observed that several adverse clinical parameters were often associated with higher emh expression , such as the presence of cervical lymph node metastasis , higher t - stages , and worse differentiation grade .
the latter two correlations support the hypothesis that hypoxia occurs more often in larger and faster growing tumors .
despite the correlations to clinical parameters , the presence of hypoxia was often an independent predictor of adverse outcome .
one explanation might be that in the hypoxic microenvironment , several mechanisms are activated that improve cellular survival under these adverse circumstances .
as the hif - 1a transcription factor is stabilized , transcription of proteins increases , including those involved in ph regulation ( ca - ix ) , cellular metabolism ( glut - 1 ) , but also genes involved in angiogenesis or oxygen transport .
opn expression occurs through a hypoxia - dependent , hif - independent pathway and reduces cell death and apoptosis in hypoxic or reoxygenated cells , it may therefore signify a more aggressive tumor phenotype 15,16,62,63 .
radiotherapy relies on the formation of free oxygen radicals to induce dna strand breaks and cell death 64 .
also , radiotherapy causes apoptosis through stabilization of p53 .
the hif - 1 pathway upregulates proteins involved in epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) , including the transcription factor snail 65,66 .
radiation - induced dna damage is reduced by emt by emergence of cancer stem cells that express high levels of free radical - scavenging proteins 67 .
moreover , snail causes radioresistance by suppressing p53 - mediated apoptosis 64,67 .
snail also contributes to cisplatin resistance , which is often concurrently administered to patients as a radiosensitizer 68 .
thus , hypoxia does not only directly affect ( chemo - ) radiosensitivity , but also indirectly through emt .
in this review we identified several studies that show that increased emh expression leads to worse lrc and survival .
however , in patients that were surgically treated only , emh expression was also associated with worse outcome 35 - 37,43,45 .
this supports the hypothesis that hypoxia also contributes to a more aggressive tumor phenotype as described above .
surprisingly , only few studies on hnscc patients treated with surgery and postoperative ( chemo ) radiotherapy found an association between emh expression and survival .
a possible explanation is that decreased tumor volume , will lead to better sensitivity to radiotherapy , as was shown by pameijer and chen 69,70 .
dunst and colleagues even described that the hypoxic tumor volume is a better prognosticator than total tumor volume to predict outcome after radiotherapy 71 .
although emh expression has been well described in hnscc in current literature , there are still opportunities for future studies .
in many publications , emh expression was studied using tissue microarrays ( tmas ) 72 .
in a tma , tumor tissues from multiple patients are placed on a single histological slide 73 .
this technique allows for high throughput in determining biomarker expression in patients , but also introduces the risk of sampling bias .
unfortunately , emh expression may vary widely within tumors , as hypoxia may occur more often in cells that are located distantly from microvessels .
this will result in intratumor heterogeneity in the expression of emh .
positive staining for hypoxic markers is often found in areas of necrosis ( perinecrotic staining patterns ) , which is by some considered proof of " actual hypoxia. " alternatively , diffuse expression of hif - 1a may also be observed , and is thought to derive from an oncogene - driven overexpression or stabilization of hif - 1a .
these expression patterns may be visualized better in whole - slide tissue sections , rather than tmas .
unfortunately , staining patterns in whole slides have only been described in two studies .
perinecrotic ca - ix staining was associated with worse outcome in a large cohort of lscc patients treated with arcon 24 .
in fact , staining pattern was a stronger predictor of outcome than the percentage of positive staining cells .
in a smaller study of opscc patients , there was no difference between perinecrotic and diffuse hif - 1a staining patterns 20 .
in the past years , hpv + hnscc has emerged as a separate entity with a difference in tumor biology , but also a better response to therapy .
there may be differences in the prevalence of tumor hypoxia in hpv + cancers and tumor hypoxia might also affect the prognosis of hpv + cancers differently than hpv - cancers .
this should be investigated in future studies .
finally , the effect of therapies that focus on hypoxia , either through improvement of tumor oxygenation , or by targeting hypoxic tumor cells should be the subject of future studies .
promising therapies include arcon , the combination of radiotherapy with carbogen gas breathing and nicotinamide administration , which is currently tested in phase iii trials 10,74 .
delivering increased radiotherapy doses to hypoxic areas in a tumor by imrt " dose - painting " is also considered , but not yet widely applied 75,76 .
alternatively , the hypoxia - sensitizer nimorazole may be added to primary radiotherapy 11 .
the efficacy of nimorazole administration in hnscc has been shown in trials within the dahanca group 77 .
finally , surgery may also be a treatment option for hypoxic tumors , to decrease the hypoxic or therapy - resistant fraction .
while devascularization of the surgical field may lead to hypoxia in the direct postoperative phase , revascularization occurs as early as several days after surgery 78 .
this may increase oxygenation , making remaining tumor cells more susceptible to postoperative radiotherapy .
future studies should investigate the feasibility of such a multimodal approach and the effect on survival of patients with hypoxic tumors .
several limitations of this review and the identified literature should be considered .
in the literature , many ways to score biomarker positivity were used .
most studies scored percentages of positive staining cells , while others also took into account staining intensity , or combined the two using a h - score .
if hif - 1a expression will be used in treatment selection , a validated , and reproducible scoring strategy should be employed , preferably without software imaging analysis , that may not be available in all centers .
moreover , the different cutoff points , as well as large heterogeneity in terms of tumor subsite and tumor stages did not allow for proper meta - analysis of the extracted data .
as the cutoff points used in the individual studies were most often the ideal cutoff values for each individual data set , data pooling may introduce bias , and give an overestimation of the effect .
therefore , we have not performed this , in contrast to an earlier review on hif - 1a only 79 .
to provide a visual overview of the results , a forest plot is provided .
another limitation of this review is that we did not include hypoxia gene expression profiles in the search .
several articles describe such profiles in head and neck cancer 80 - 84 .
in the present study we have chosen to focus on ihc , as hnscc is still highly prevalent in resource - limited areas .
compared to techniques like quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) or the use of microarrays , ihc may be performed at relatively low cost .
conclusion in this systematic review , we identified hif - 1a , hif - 2a , ca - ix , glut - 1 , and opn as the best studied endogenous markers of tumor hypoxia .
in general , expression of these biomarkers was associated with worse survival , almost regardless of the therapy provided .
these proteins are not only biomarkers , but are also part of cellular survival mechanisms .
therefore , emh overexpression may result in worse prognosis not only due to hypoxia , but also because of a more aggressive tumor phenotype .
the effect of tumor hypoxia in hnscc patients warrants further investigation .
studies should investigate the best treatment option for hypoxic tumors , for instance hypoxia - modified radiotherapy schedules , targeted therapies against hypoxic cells or excision of the hypoxic tissue to improve radiation sensitivity .
knowledge on the tumor hypoxia status will help clinicians to select tailored treatments for each individual patient and thus enable personalized cancer care .
conflict of interest none declared .

arrhythmias cardiac ventricular fibrillation atrial fibrillation gap junctions electrotronic coupling myocardial electrical properties myocardial infarction the effective management of cardiac arrhythmias , either of atrial or of ventricular origin , remains a major challenge .
sudden cardiac death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias remains the leading cause of death in industrialized countries ( hayashi et al. , 2015 ) while atrial fibrillation is the most common rhythm disorder , the prevalence of this arrhythmia is increasing and accounts for nearly one quarter of ischemic strokes in the elderly population ( chugh et al. , 2015 ) .
yet , despite the enormity of the problem , effective therapeutic interventions remain elusive .
in fact , several initially promising antiarrhythmic agents were found to increase rather than decrease mortality in patients recovering from myocardial infarction ( behr and roden , 2013 ) .
the question then is what went wrong , why have these pharmacological interventions proven to be so ineffective ?
an obvious answer that is the drugs were designed to attack the wrong therapeutic target .
clearly , targeting single ion channels ( using either isolated ion channels or single myocyte preparations ) has proven to be less than effective .
what then is the appropriate target ?
it is well established that cardiac electrical properties can vary substantially between single cells and intact preparations .
one obvious example is the observation that action potential duration is much longer in isolated cells as compared to multi - cellular preparations or intact hearts .
due to the low electrical resistance between adjacent myocytes , the cells act in coordinated fashion producing an " electrotonic interdependence " between neighboring cells that results in a more uniform ( and shorter ) action potential duration than would be recorded in single uncoupled cells .
engelmann ( 1875 ) was perhaps the first to recognize that the cardiac myocytes work as coordinated unit .
he proposed what he called a " healing over " principle ( as referenced by janse , 2003 ) to describe how myocytes were joined to work and to live together ( forming what is now known as a functional syncytium ) .
however , the electrophysiological basis for the cell - to - cell - coupling was not established until the 1950 's when dr. silvio weidmann laid the " engineering " foundations of modern cardiac electrophysiology .
his work provided the quantitative basis to engelmann 's " healing over " concept ( niggli et al. , 2006 ) , recognizing the importance of passive myocardial electrical properties to cardiac excitation / conduction ( weidmann , 1952 ) .
weidmann ( 1952 ) applied earlier theoretical principles ( hodgkin and rushton , 1946 ) to model a cardiac ( purkinje ) fiber as a core - conductor / cable , having " a well - conducting protoplasm and by a thin surface membrane having a high resistance ( rm ) and a large capacity ( cm ) per unit area. " this " cable model " considers that the intracellular and extracellular potentials vary along the longitudinal axis only , and that both the cytoplasm and the extracellular spaces can be approximated as ideal ohmic conductors ( with ri and re respective resistances per unit length ) .
hence , propagating cardiac action potentials along a fiber can be described by the following second - order partial differential equation ( pde ) : ( 1 ) ( 1re + ri ) d2dx2vm = cm.ddtvm + iionic ( v,t ) where iionic is the nonlinear membrane ionic current density ( mua / cm2 ) , defined by the active / stochastic electrical properties of the cell .
alternatively , multiplying by rm , equation ( 1 ) can be re - written as ( 2 ) lambda2d2dx2vm = tauddtvm + vionic ( v,t ) where lambda = rmre + ri is the length ( and / or space ) constant , a parameter that indicates how far a stationary current will " electrotonically " influence the voltage along the fiber , and tau = rmcm is the trans - membrane time - constant ( e.g. , plonsey , 1969 ; aidley , 1971 ) .
using this theoretical framework , weidmann ( 1952 ) demonstrated that the electrical length / space constant was much larger than the cell length ( defining the basis for the " electrotonic " modulation / homogenization of potentials across adjacent cells ) .
he found that the internal longitudinal resistance ( myoplasm in series with cell - to - cell contact ) was much smaller than the membrane resistance .
this result suggested the existence of low - resistance connections between neighboring cells , which weidmann later demonstrated by studying and modeling ( via the use of analog electrical circuits ) the diffusion of potassium ( weidmann , 1960 , 1966 ) , showing that permeability of the intercalated disk to this ion was far greater than of the cell membrane .
subsequent investigations have identified the structural components ( i. e. , conforming proteins ) of these inter - cellular junctional connections / channels , or " gap junctions " and have also confirmed their role in electrotonic coupling of the adjacent cells and in action potential propagation ( for reviews see de groot and coronel , 2004 ; wit and peters , 2012 ; dhein et al. , 2014 ; kleber and saffitz , 2014 ) .
alterations in these passive electrical properties can also lead to the generation of abnormal cardiac rhythms ( both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias ) .
myocardial infarction and / or acute ischemia provoke profound changes in the passive electrical properties of cardiac muscle ( de groot and coronel , 2004 ) .
in particular , electrotonic uncoupling the myocytes disrupts the coordinated activation and repolarization of cardiac tissue .
the resulting compensatory changes in ionic currents decrease cardiac electrical stability increasing the risk for life - threatening changes in the cardiac rhythm .
thus , the electrical properties of myocardial cells must be considered as a unit rather than in isolation .
it is the purpose of this monograph to evaluate the largely neglected relationship between changes in passive electrical properties of cardiac muscle and arrhythmia formation .
the book contains both state - of - the art reviews of the literature and original research articles that address various aspects of the effects of the passive electrical properties of the myocardium on cardiac rhythm .
a brief summary of each chapter follow .
the role that changes in intrinsic properties of pacemaker cells ( yaniv et al. , 2015 ) , sinoatrial fibrosis ( csepe et al. , 2015 ) and source sink ( source - - electrical charge for impulse generation ; sink - - the charge necessary to excite the surrounding tissue , impulse conduction ) balance ( unudurthi et al. , 2014 ) play in sinoatrial function and dysfunction are reviewed in chapters 2 , 3 and 4 , respectively .
in a similar manner , the predominant role that gap junctions play in both normal and pathological changes in cardiac rhythm is reviewed in chapters 5 - 8 .
for example , dhein et al .
( 2014 ) and kleber and saffitz ( 2014 ) review how electrotonic interactions , mediated both by junctional coupling proteins and geometrical / physiological factors , modulate source - sink phenomena in order to trigger / sustain normal cardiac rhythm and arrhythmogenesis ( chapters 5 and 6 ) .
kessler et al .
( 2014 ) further evaluate the contribution of heterogeneous gap junction remodeling to an increased risk for arrhythmias in several pathological conditions including hypertrophic , dilated , ischemic , and arrhythmic cardiomyopathies ( chapter 7 ) .
smit and coronel ( 2014 ) next examine whether stem cells ( implanted for stem cell replacement therapy ) form functional electrotonic connections with cardiomyocytes and then evaluate the proarrhythmic risk that could result as a consequence of these connections ( chapter 8 ) .
trayanova et al .
( 2014 ) provide a state of the art assessment of computational modeling of atrial and ventricular arrhythmogenesis that result from disease induced changes in myocardial passive electrical properties ( chapter 9 ) , while cabo ( 2014 ) uses similar computational approaches to analyze the effect on the dynamics of impulse propagation induced by simulated premature ventricular contractions in the infracted myocardium ( structural heterogeneities caused by changes in gap junction conductance ) ( chapter 10 ) .
the functional significance of myofibroblast sodium currents on supraventricular arrhythmia formation is similarly investigated by koivumaki et al .
( 2014 ) ( chapter 11 ) , while walton et al .
( 2013 ) evaluate electrotonic modulation of repolarization using optical mapping techniques in species with large ( pig ) and small ( rat ) hearts ( chapter 12 ) .
despite the unequivocal mechanistic relationship ( s ) between passive electrical changes and arrhythmias , no study to date has directly assessed the ability of indices reflective of electrotonic coupling to stratify arrhythmic susceptibility in vivo .
therefore , del rio et al .
( 2015 ) studied the effects of exercise - induced autonomic neural activation on electrotonic coupling as measured by myocardial electrical impedance in dogs know to be either susceptible or resistant to ischemically - induced ventricular fibrillation .
they report that beta - adrenergic receptor activation enhances electrotonic coupling to a greater extent in susceptible as compared to dogs resistant to malignant arrhythmias and could thereby mask pro - arrhythmic repolarization abnormalities , an observation that may help explain false negative findings associated with exercise - stress testing in the clinic ( chapter13 ) .
the authors hope that this monograph will provide a better appreciation of the crucial role that myocardial passive electrical properties play in not only the maintenance of a normal cardiac rhythm but also how changes in these parameters can trigger atrial and ventricular arrhythmias .
the application of this knowledge should facilitate the development of more effective anti - arrhythmic therapies .
conflict of interest statement the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .

nematic liquid crystals with high and low initial ionic contamination have been examined .
it has been shown that titanium dioxide nanoparticles reduced the ion density of liquid crystals with high initial ionic contamination from 134.5 x 1012 cm - 3 to 63.2 x 1012 cm - 3 .
in the case of liquid crystals with low initial ionic contamination , the nanoparticles led to an insignificant increase of ion density from 19.8 x 1012 cm - 3 to 25.7 x 1012 cm - 3 .
ionic impurities liquid crystals nanoparticles titanium dioxide this article is part of the thematic series " nanostructured liquid crystal systems and applications " .
findings nowadays , liquid crystals ( lcs ) are widely used in different display and non - display applications .
the development of display techniques has led to the construction of high - quality screens including fully transparent [ 1 ] , flexible screens [ 2 ] and dual - view [ 3 ] displays in the past years .
the area of lcs for non - display applications is also rapidly growing .
the application of lcs includes metamaterials [ 4 ] , photonic crystals [ 5 ] , plasmonic structures [ 6 ] , thz devices [ 7 ] , sensors [ 8 ] , diffractive optics [ 9 ] , adaptive lens technologies [ 10 ] and vision correction [ 11 ] , as well as tunable filters [ 12 ] and dispersion for imaging [ 13 ] .
in addition , nanoparticles can induce other new functions in liquid crystals , including improved response time [ 14 - 15 ] , surface plasmon resonance [ 16 ] , and improvements in alignment [ 17 ] .
the ionic contamination of lcs remains one of the challenges to lc technology .
ionic conductivity negatively affects lc device performance , leading to slow response , a reduction of the voltage holding ratio , and image quality degradation .
despite the negative effect of ionic contamination in display techniques , lcs with high ionic conductivity may be used in non - display applications [ 18 - 19 ] .
although modern lc mixtures are highly purified , uncontrolled contamination during utilization can occur [ 20 ] .
physical - chemical methods provide a desirable level of lc purity during synthesis which cannot be applied during the process of using the lc devices .
the search for a new solution to control the ionic contamination induced during lc device utilization is a current research focus in the field of lc display techniques .
extensive experimental research has shown that nanoparticles ( nps ) affect the ionic conductivity of lcs .
however , data obtained from different experimental studies are contradictory .
the decrease of ionic contamination was observed in lcs doped with carbon nanoparticles [ 21 ] , semiconductor quantum dots [ 22 ] , and metal nps [ 23 ] .
at the same time , the increase of ionic contamination due to doping with nps was reported in other papers [ 24 - 26 ] .
this contradiction was resolved by the theory developed by garbovskiy et al .
[ 27 - 30 ] .
in the framework of this theory it was shown that the same nanoparticles can lead to both contamination and purification of lcs .
the theory considers adsorption and desorption of ions on nanoparticle surfaces and takes into account the initial ionic contamination of lcs .
the same np can lead to both purification and contamination of lcs under certain conditions .
the aim of this study is the experimental verification of garbovskiy 's assumption that the same nps may have a different effect on the lc ionic conductivity depending on the initial lc contamination .
we have examined nematic liquid crystals with low ( lc1 ) and high ( lc2 ) ionic contamination and their composites with tio2 nanoparticles .
the impact of tio2 nanoparticles on purification and contamination in lcs has been experimentally shown .
the plane - parallel cells consisted of two glass substrates covered by indium - tin oxide ( ito ) electrodes and rubbed polyimide layers were used for measurements .
the thickness of the lc cells was set by spacers and controlled by measurements of empty cell capacitance .
the thickness of the cells was 15 +/ - 1 mum .
we used commercial nematic lc ( zhk1282 , niopik , moscow ) with low initial ionic contamination ( lc1 ) .
the ionic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ( ctabr ) was added to the same lc to produce a lc with high ionic conductivity ( lc2 ) .
the surfactant dissolves in lcs and dissociates on br - and cta + ions [ 31 ] .
the concentration of ctabr in lc2 was about 0.1 wt % .
lc2 was studied as a sample of lc that was contaminated during the utilization process .
titanium dioxide nanoparticles ( plasmotherm , moscow ) were doped into lc1 and lc2 .
the nanoparticles were a mixture of anatase and rutile with an average particle size of 50 nm. used nps were obtained by plasma synthesis and were not covered with any ligands .
dry nps were added to lcs at a concentration of 0.25 , 0.5 and 1 wt % .
the composites were prepared in isotropic phase over one hour by ultrasonication .
to estimate ion density ( c ) and average diffusion coefficient ( d ) in lc1 , lc2 and their composites with tio2 nps , low frequency dielectric spectra were measured .
all measurements were performed with a lcr - meter ( agilent e4980a ) under the same conditions at room temperature .
the investigation results of the low frequency dielectric spectra lcs are shown in fig. 1. the spectra were obtained in the range from 20 hz to 1 khz .
in this spectral range , the dispersion of dielectric permittivity is related to ionic conductivity. fig. 1 represents real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity of initially low - contaminated liquid crystals ( lc1 ) and their composites with tio2 nanoparticles .
the increase of np concentration led to the enhancement of the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity .
we have observed an insignificant change in the spectra shown in fig. 1. in contrast , the changes in the spectra were significant in the case of the initially high - contaminated lc2 ( fig. 1 ) .
doping lc2 with tio2 nps resulted in a reduction of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity .
this indicates a decrease of the ionic conductivity of lc2 .
figure 1 the low frequency spectra of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity for lc1 ( a ) , lc2 ( b ) , and their composites .
in this frequency range , the spectra of the dielectric permittivity can be approximated by following equations [ 24 ] : where c i - ion density , q - elementary charge , d - average diffusion coefficient , epsilon0 - dielectric constant , d - thickness of the cell gap , k b - boltzmann factor , t - temperature , f - frequency , and epsiloninfinity - high - frequency dielectric permittivity .
we have evaluated the ion density and the average diffusion coefficient of lc1 , lc2 and their composites .
the data are shown in table 1 .
table 1 ion density and average diffusion coefficient of lc1 , lc2 and their composites .
tio2 concentration , wt % lc1 lc2 ion density x 1012 cm - 3 diffusion coefficient x 10 - 8 cm2 / s ion density x 1012 cm - 3 diffusion coefficient x 10 - 8 cm2 / s 0 19.8 3.8 134.5 47.5 0.25 23.2 4.2 105.2 52.3 0.5 24.9 5.6 72.7 56.2 1 25.7 6.5 63.2 60.0 the initial data show that increasing the tio2 np concentration up to 1 wt % leads to the rise of the ion density to 30 % in the case of initially low - contaminated lc1 .
in the case of initially high - contaminated lc2 , the ion concentration is reduced almost twice by doping with 1 wt % tio2 nps .
in both cases , the increase of concentration leads to an increasing diffusion coefficient .
moreover , the estimated diffusion coefficient of ions in lc2 was larger .
in the framework of garbovskiy 's theory , the surface of the np is considered as a surface with absorbing sites .
because of adsorption / desorption processes on adsorbing sites , the concentration of ions in the lc composites change .
ideal nanoparticles will have a high surface density of adsorbing sites which are completely unoccupied .
this ideal np surface would result in more pure lcs , regardless of the initial ionic contamination .
however , the adsorbing sites of real nps are partially occupied .
in general , the effect of doping lcs with nps on the ionic conductivity depends on the initial contamination of the lc as well as the surfaces states of the nps , ion adsorption and desorption rates .
adsorption / desorption rates and contamination of the np surface define a critical concentration of ions .
if the initial concentration of mobile ions in lcs is beyond the critical concentration , doping the lc with nps will lead to purification of the lc. if the initial concentration of mobile ions in a lc is lower than the critical concentration , doping the lc with nps will lead to contamination of the lc. in our experiments , tio2 nps purified lc2 with an initial ion concentration of about 1014 cm - 3 and slightly contaminated lc1 with an initial ion concentration of about 1013 cm - 3 ( table 1 ) .
there are several types of ions in liquid crystals in our experiments such as the ions present in the initial lc , ions adsorbed on the surfaces of nanoparticles , ionic impurities introduced by aligning layers , glue , and br - and cta + ions in the case of lc2 .
all of these types of ions may have different density , size , diffusion coefficient and adsorption / desorption rates .
in such complicated systems , the proportion between different types of ions can change [ 24,29 ] and may influence the average diffusion coefficient .
moreover , the change of dopant concentration may have resulted in the variation of the activation energy that affected the diffusion coefficients [ 32 ] .
to conclude , we would like mention other factors that influence the ionic conductivity of the lc composites .
as it was mentioned above , a high density of unoccupied adsorbing states is desirable .
size , aggregation , local fields near nanoparticles and the action of a high electric field affect the purification / contamination processes .
nps with smaller size have a larger surface area thereby facilitate purification / contamination processes .
nanoparticles in lcs tend to aggregate .
this leads to the reduction of the total number of adsorbing sites .
moreover , in composites with a higher np concentration , the aggregation process is stronger .
dry nanoparticles tend to aggregate in a nematic liquid crystal matrix .
we have observed this aggregation in a polarized optical microscope at a concentration of over 0.5 wt % .
this imposes restrictions on the concentration of nps .
several studies [ 33 - 35 ] considered the local fields near nanoparticles as a trap of ions .
such a consideration is acceptable for nps with high polarizability such as graphene or ferroelectric nps .
the next factor is a high electric field .
it was shown that an electric field higher than 2.5 v / mum induces the desorption of ions [ 27 ] .
we have studied the impact of tio2 nps on nematic lcs with different initial ionic contamination .
it has been shown that nps reduced the ionic density of lcs by two times with an initial contamination of 134.5 x 1012 cm - 3 .
these types of nps can be used to prevent uncontrolled ionic contamination that occurs during lc device production and utilization .
the study of the nature of the adsorption states , the estimation of adsorption and desorption rates of ions for various types of nps , will be the next step in understanding the effect of doping liquid crystals with nanoparticles and the content of ion impurities resulting from this process .

background genomic methods have proved to be important tools in the analysis of genetic diversity across the range of species and can be used to reveal processes underlying both short - and long - term evolutionary change .
this study applied genomic methods to investigate population structure and inbreeding in a common uk dog breed , the labrador retriever .
results we found substantial within - breed genetic differentiation , which was associated with the role of the dog ( i.e. working , pet , show ) and also with coat colour ( i.e. black , yellow , brown ) .
there was little evidence of geographical differentiation .
highly differentiated genomic regions contained genes and markers associated with skull shape , suggesting that at least some of the differentiation is related to human - imposed selection on this trait .
we also found that the total length of homozygous segments ( runs of homozygosity , rohs ) was highly correlated with inbreeding coefficient .
conclusions this study demonstrates that high - density genomic data can be used to quantify genetic diversity and to decipher demographic and selection processes .
analysis of genetically differentiated regions in the uk labrador retriever population suggests the possibility of human - imposed selection on craniofacial characteristics .
the high correlation between estimates of inbreeding from genomic and pedigree data for this breed demonstrates that genomic approaches can be used to quantify inbreeding levels in dogs , which will be particularly useful where pedigree information is missing .

this problem has been particularly pronounced in dogs , where founder effects at breed formation , extensive use of popular sires and intensive selection practices have had a negative impact on the genetic health of many breeds [ 1 ] and have contributed to the propagation of unfavourable traits [ 2 ] and hereditary diseases [ 3 , 4 ] .
concerns about these issues have led to recent efforts to improve genetic health in this species [ 5 - 7 ] ; a key component of this process involves characterisation of genetic diversity , structure and inbreeding within dog breeds .
the labrador retriever derives from working dogs of the labrador / newfoundland region of canada that were brought in the nineteenth century to britain by aristocrats and used as retrievers for hunting .
following an association between the earl of malmesbury and duke of buccleuch , a breeding program was established at the scottish buccleuch kennels in the 1880s , which contributed to the foundation of the modern labrador retriever breed .
the breed was formally recognized by the kennel club in 1903 ( and in 1917 by the american kennel club ) .
labrador retrievers are noted for their retrieving ability but also for their easy temperament , making them popular family pets .
it is by a large margin the most populous kennel club - registered breed in the uk ( 32,507 new registrations in 2015 , compared to 22,577 for the next most common breed , cocker spaniel ) .
labrador retrievers are also the most popular breed in many other developed countries , including the u.s.a. , australia , canada , and sweden .
labrador retrievers are predisposed to a large number of heritable disorders [ 3 , 4 ] , including hip and elbow dysplasia , debilitating orthopaedic diseases [ 8 ] .
while traditional pedigree - based methods can be used to characterise breed attributes , the development of molecular genetic tools has provided additional resources with the potential for finer - scale analysis .
while the uptake of molecular methods was initially slower in companion animals than in livestock , high - density single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) arrays are available for the major companion animal species ( dogs , cats , rabbits ) , providing a valuable tool for genetic diversity characterisation and for the inference of demographic and selection processes .
if the costs of high - throughput sequencing continue to fall , this strategy may become the preferred alternative to commercial snp arrays .
the aim of this study was to apply high - density snp data to elucidate population - level processes in the uk labrador retriever population .
methods samples the animals in the study were kennel club - registered uk labrador retrievers born between 2002 and 2008 .
the samples were collected as part of a project on canine hip dysplasia [ 9 , 10 ] ; all dogs had previously been radiographed under the british veterinary association ( bva )/ kennel club ( kc ) hip scoring scheme [ 11 ] .
genotypes 1008 dna samples were genotyped using the illumina canine high density beadchip containing 173,662 snps .
quality control was applied to assure both sample and marker quality .
a sample call rate threshold of 95 % was applied , removing 272 samples with low call rate and 8 females misidentified as males by illumina genome studio software ( i.e. with low heterozygosity on the x chromosome ) , leaving 728 animals in the final sample ( 195 males , 533 females ) .
initial marker quality criteria were applied using genome studio .
a total of 59,260 markers were discarded for low call rate (< 98 %) , low reproducibility ( gts < 0.6 ) , low or confounded signal ( abr mean < 0.3 ) and low minor allele frequency ( maf < 0.01 ) .
further quality control on the markers was applied using plink [ 12 ] , removing snps on the sex chromosomes and those showing deviation from hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( p < 8.0e - 8 , applying a bonferroni correction ) , leaving 117,971 snps for further analysis .
phenotypes phenotypic and lifestyle information was collected from dog owners using a questionnaire ( additional file 1 ) .
the classification ( role ) of dogs as gundog , pet , showdog or " other work " was based on two questions : the first related to whether it was a working dog ( options : pet , gundog , guide dog , sniffer dog , hearing dog or other work ) and the second related to the activities in which the dog participates ( options : none , agility trials , showing , field trials , obedience trials or other ) .
dogs that were identified as guide dogs , sniffer dogs , hearing dogs or other work were pooled together as " other work. " a strict quality control procedure was implemented such that any dogs with questionable or uninterpretable information ( e.g. dogs identified as both " gundog " and " pet ") were considered to have unknown classification .
dogs with rare coat colours ( black & tan , fox red , liver ) were considered unclassified , leaving three categories : black , yellow and chocolate .
geographical information was summarized according to region of the uk : 1 = orkney islands , 2 = scotland ( other than orkney ) , 3 = northwest england , 4 = northeast england , 5 = wales , 6 = midlands ( england ) , 7 = east anglia ( england ) , 8 = southwest england , 9 = southeast england , 10 = northern ireland .
pedigree analysis and estimation of effective population size in order to assess whether the sample of 728 was representative of the uk labrador retriever population , we performed a preliminary analysis of the pedigree relationships .
the mean kinship coefficient ( half the relationship coefficient ) [ 13 , 14 ] for the 728 analysed dogs was 0.038 ( se 6.20e - 05 ) , similar to the level for a random set of 728 labrador retrievers of similar ages selected from the full pedigree ( 0.030 , se 4.73e - 05 ) ( the mean kinship coefficient between the experimental set and the random set was 0.033 , se 3.77e - 05 ) .
thus we conclude that the dataset reflects the overall diversity in the breed .
the skewed sex ratio of the sample reflects the population of dogs on which hip scoring is performed [ 15 ] , which may be due to the greater proportion of females used for breeding ( there is no evidence for a sex ratio bias in the breed as a whole [ 16 ]) .
analysis of pedigree - based inbreeding was performed on a pedigree of 25,526 animals including the genotyped animals .
calculations of inbreeding coefficients were conducted using endog software [ 17 ] .
the following parameters describe the completeness of the pedigree : mean maximum generations ( number of generations separating the individual from its furthest ancestor ) = 11.26 , mean complete generations ( number of generations , g , separating the individual from its furthest ancestor , where all 2g ancestors of the individual are known , = 3.58 , mean equivalent generations ( sum of ( 1 / 2 ) n terms over all known ancestors , where n is the number of generations separating the individual from the ancestor ) = 5.58 .
the inbreeding effective population size ( n e , which predicts the rate of decrease in heterozygosity ) was estimated as 1 /( 2 incrementf l ) where f is the inbreeding coefficient , incrementf is the annual rate of inbreeding and l is the average generation interval ( estimated as 4.5 years for the uk labrador retriever population [ 18 ]) , such that incrementf l is the rate of inbreeding per generation [ 13 ] .
we then regressed the natural logarithm of ( 1 - f ) on birthdate , such that incrementf l was estimated by ( - 1x ) the slope of the relationship between ln ( 1 - f ) and birthdate [ 19 ] .
birthdate was available for 17,348 individuals in the pedigree .
population structure analyses principal component analysis ( pca ) was performed on the full dataset using gcta [ 20 ] .
structure version 2.3.4 [ 21 ] was applied to approximately one third of the genotype data ( every third marker across the genome , resulting in 39,324 markers ) , to reduce linkage disequilibrium between markers and for computational ease .
an alternative data subset was generated using linkage disequilibrium - based data pruning in plink [ 12 ] , with the default options ( window size = 50 snps , the number of snps to shift the window at each step = 5 , the variance inflation factor threshold = 2 ) , which generated a data subset of 13,310 snps .
five replicates were run under the admixture model for each value of k ( number of clusters ) from 1 to 5 with a burn - in period of 20,000 iterations and 10,000 iterations after burn - in. individuals were labelled according to role of the dog ( gundog , pet , showdog , other work , unknown ) , geographical location ( 1 - 10 ) and coat colour ( black , yellow , chocolate ) to assess whether these factors were associated with genetic clusters .
delta k , which estimates the second derivative of the log likelihood profile from the structure analysis , was calculated for k = 2 to 4 [ 22 ] .
results were graphed using distruct [ 23 ] .
linkage disequilibrium calculation and estimation of effective population size linkage disequilibrium , measured as the squared correlation between snp pairs ( r 2 ) , was calculated using plink [ 12 ] for all syntenic marker pairs on the autosomes .
to enable plotting ld as a function of marker distance , marker pairs were divided into distance bins and r 2 was averaged for each bin .
the expression e ( r 2 ) = 1 /( alpha + 4n e c ) was used to estimate effective population size ( n e ) , based on the relationship between ld and marker distance [ 24 ] , using the approach introduced by references [ 25 ] and [ 26 ] ; c is the recombination frequency ( expressed as distance in morgans ) and alpha is set equal to 1 when mutation is not considered [ 24 ] and to 2 when mutation is accounted for [ 27 ] .
distance between markers in morgans was estimated based on 0.97 cm / mb [ 28 ] .
average r 2 values between markers with minor allele frequency > 0.1 were calculated for each c value / distance bin and n e values were estimated for each bin using two values of alpha ( 1 or 2 ) .
n e values were also estimated based on r 2 adjusted for sample size ( adjusted r 2 = r 2 - 1 / 2n , where n = 728 ) [ 29 ] .
assuming linear population growth over time , each bin is associated with the n e of a specific time in the past , with the number of generations in the past given by 1 / 2c .
runs of homozygosity runs of homozygosity ( roh ) in the full dataset were identified using plink [ 12 ] using the default options .
this algorithm scans snp data along the genome for homozygous stretches .
for each snp , it calculates the proportion of completely homozygous windows that encompass that snp .
if more than a specified proportion ( default = 5 %) of these windows are completely homozygous , then the snp will be included in the putative roh .
if the putative roh includes more than a specified threshold ( default = 100 ) of such consecutive snps , it is declared a roh .
the algorithm allows for a specified number of heterozygous ( default = 1 ) and missing snps ( default = 5 ) within a roh .
rohs were restricted to include at least 100 snps and be over 1 mb in length .
the " - - homozyg - group " option was used for a subset of chromosomes to obtain pools of overlapping segments that share alleles .
froh was defined as the total length of rohs in the genome divided by 2,198,710,490 , which is the number of base pairs covered by the caninehd chip , according to canfam2.0 .
basic froh statistics were calculated for the full dataset and for subgroups .
chi 2 tests were used to test for association between cluster assignment and a subset of overlapping roh segments .
population differentiation analysis for each snp marker across the genome , unbiased estimates of weir and cockerham 's fst [ 30 ] were calculated as functions of variance components [ 31 ] to compare individuals from each of two sub - populations defined by the structure analysis .
a similar approach has been applied previously to identify genomic regions showing differentiation between breeds [ 32 , 33 ] but in this study , all individuals were members of the same breed .
in order to maximize our ability to identify regions associated with the within - breed cluster division , we thus chose to analyse a subset of the most highly differentiated individuals ( 27 from each of the two clusters ) , as defined by structure .
to reduce random effects of individual snps with extreme allele frequency differences , individual fst values were averaged across sliding windows .
in order to determine how best to define these windows ( i.e. by physical size or number of snps ) , we compared the distribution of numbers of snps per window of fixed physical size to the distribution of physical sizes per window of fixed number of snps , where an odd number of snps was used to give equal numbers of markers on either side of the central snp and the choice of numbers of snps per window ( 9 , 13 and 17 ) was based on previous studies using high - density snp panels [ 33 , 34 ] .
the distribution of physical sizes per window of fixed number of snps resulted in far less dispersed distributions ( additional file 2 ) in contrast to studies conducted using less dense marker panels [ 35 ] , thus individual fst values were averaged across sliding windows of 9 , 13 and 17 snps ( fst - windows - 9 , fst - windows - 13 , fst - windows - 17 ) .
for each window size , the top 0.05 % of fst windows were identified as differentiated regions [ 33 , 34 ] .
markers within 1 - mb in the set of top fst windows were grouped together in regions .
liftover [ 36 ] was used to convert snp positions from canfam2.0 to canfam3.1 .
all annotated genes within regions showing strong evidence for differentiation were extracted from the canfam3.1 assembly in ensembl [ 37 ] using biomart [ 38 ] .
annotated genes found within 0.5 mb of the highly differentiated regions were evaluated for known functions or disease associations .
gene ontology ( go ) enrichment of biological processes was evaluated using the panther overrepresentation test in which the target list of genes was compared to the canis familiaris reference list [ 39 ] .
results population structure in order to characterise the structure of the uk labrador retriever population , principal components and structure analyses were performed .
the first 250 principal components ( pcs ) from the pca of the genotype data , chosen according to kaiser 's criterion of inclusion of all components with eigenvalues greater than one [ 40 ] , explained approximately 65 % of the total variance , with the first , second and third pcs explaining approximately 6.8 % , 0.94 % and 0.82 % of the total variance ( fig. 1 ). from a visual assessment , the first principal component mainly separated showdogs from gundogs , where gundogs generally had higher pc1 values although there was some overlap ( fig. 1a ) .
dogs classified as unknown or " other work " were distributed across the pc1 spectrum ; the majority of pets were found clustered with showdogs although a sizeable minority clustered with gundogs (~ 38 % had pc1 values greater than 0 ) .
the dogs with chocolate coats had negative values on the pc1 axis and were thus found in the region of the pca plot occupied by the showdogs ; yellow and black dogs were distributed across pc1 ( fig. 1b ) .
there was no obvious geographical structuring ( fig. 1c ) .
discrimination of individuals on pc2 was related to different sire families ( results not shown ) ; there was also separation between yellow and black dogs such that almost all individuals with positive pc2 values were black. fig. 1 principal components analysis ( pca ) of uk labrador retrievers : a dogs labelled by coat colour ( black , yellow , chocolate ) ; b dogs labelled by role ( gundog , showdog , pet , unknown , other ) ; c dogs labelled by geographical location the structure analysis of one - third of the markers showed the same clustering results as those for the ld - pruned markers , thus we describe the former below .
the log likelihood profile increased from k = 1 to 5 , but was fairly flat for k >= 2 and delta k was maximized at k = 2 ( fig. 2 ) , together suggesting that the best estimate for number of clusters was k = 2 .
the overall allele frequency divergence between the two clusters was 0.0491. of the 728 dogs , 361 ( 50 %) had high assignment probability (> 0.8 ) to cluster 1 , while 168 ( 23 %) had high assignment probability to cluster 2 .
the remaining 199 dogs ( 27 %) had intermediate assignment probabilities ( 0.2 - 0.8 ) to both clusters .
results were highly consistent with those from the pca : across the 728 dogs , the correlation between pc1 and assignment probability to cluster 1 was almost identical to 1 .
proportion of membership of the pre - defined populations ( q ) to the two clusters ( k = 2 ) measures the average assignment probability to a cluster across all individuals in that population ( table 1 ) .
gundogs had high membership coefficients for cluster 1 ( q = 0.827 ) while showdogs had high membership coefficients for cluster 2 ( q = 0.896 ) .
pets had a slightly higher membership coefficient for cluster 2 ( q = 0.552 ) .
dogs classified as " other work " or unknown had higher membership coefficients for cluster 1 than 2 .
yellow and black dogs had higher membership coefficients for cluster 1 ( q = 0.666 and 0.723 , respectively ) while chocolate dogs were more strongly associated with cluster 2 ( q = 0.839 ) .
dogs from all regions except orkney had higher membership coefficients for cluster 1 ( q = 0.521 - 0.721 ) , where the highest value was for dogs from mainland scotland .
dogs from orkney ( only four dogs ) had a higher membership coefficient for cluster 2 ( q = 0.643 ) .
these results were consistent with the pca in which three of the four orkney dogs had pc1 values less than - 0.030 and ~ 50 % of dogs from mainland scotland had pc1 values greater than 0.028 (~ 82 % with pc1 values > 0 ). fig. 2 results from structure analysis of uk labrador retrievers : a assignment probabilities of dogs from different role categories to clusters identified for k = 2 ; b plot of ln ( probability of data ) ( 5 points per k value ) and delta k value ( dotted blue line ) [ 22 ] as a function of k value table 1 average membership coefficients to cluster 1 for different classification categories ( k = 2 structure analysis ) category average membership coefficient to cluster 1 role / activity gun 0.827 pet 0.448 show 0.104 other 0.631 unknown 0.644 coat colour black 0.723 yellow 0.666 chocolate 0.161 geographical location orkney 0.357 scotland ( not orkney ) 0.721 nw england 0.521 ne england 0.553 wales 0.609 midland 0.557 east anglia 0.665 sw england 0.625 se england 0.654 northern ireland 0.680 in the k = 3 analyses , cluster 1 from the k = 2 analyses was split into two new clusters , for which showdogs had low average membership coefficients ( q = 0.076 and 0.033 ) .
the average membership coefficients of yellow and black dogs for the two clusters were similar ( yellow : 0.298 and black : 0.259 for one cluster , yellow : 0.381 and black : 0.476 for the other cluster ) while the average membership coefficients of chocolate dogs for both clusters were lower ( 0.060 and 0.107 ) .
pedigree - based estimates of effective population size the relationship between the annual rate of inbreeding and time ( birthdate ) was used to estimate the inbreeding effective population size , based on the uk labrador retriever pedigree .
assuming a generation interval of 4.5 years and using the entire pedigree with birthdates , the estimate of n e was 55 .
two modifications to the dataset were made to assess effects on the estimated n e. if the oldest dogs in the pedigree ( birthdates prior to 19 / 02 / 1982 , 30,000 days since 01 / 01 / 1900 , approximately 14 % of the population ) were removed , the estimate was 66 .
if individuals with inbreeding coefficient equal to 0 ( indicating lack of relevant pedigree information , such that mean complete generations , equivalent generations and maximum generations were all significantly lower for the individuals with f = 0 ) are removed , the estimate of n e was 82 .
linkage disequilibrium and effective population size for comparison with the pedigree - based estimates , high - density snp data was also used to estimate n e , based on the pattern of pairwise ld as a function of marker distances .
ld shows the typical decreasing exponential relationship with marker distance ( fig. 3 ) , with average r 2 equal to 0.625 for bins with markers less than 1 kbp apart and an average r 2 less than 0.1 for bins with markers greater than 820 kbp apart .
using average r 2 for markers between 33 and 100 cm apart ( average physical distance ~ 41 mb ) provides an n e estimate for ~ 1 generation in the past ; estimates ranged from 74 to 88 , depending on whether mutation is accounted for and whether r 2 was adjusted for sample size. fig. 3 pattern of linkage disequilibrium as a function of marker distance for uk labrador retrievers : points represent average r 2 for pairs of markers in bins of specified average between - marker distance .
dotted lines indicate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the r 2 distribution ( i.e. where 95 % of the data points are located ) inbreeding and roh pedigree - based inbreeding coefficients were compared with roh characteristics for the population .
pedigree - based inbreeding coefficients for the population ranged from 0.0000795 - 0.337 ( mean = 0.0702 ) ( fig. 4 ) .
the number of roh segments ranged from 31 to 104 ( mean = 70.85 ) and the total length of roh segments ranged from 147,273 - 1,236,070 kb ( mean = 457,465 ) .
froh ranged from 0.067 to 0.56 ( mean = 0.21 , se = 7.39e - 05 ) .
the pearson correlation coefficient between the pedigree - based inbreeding coefficient ( fpedigree ) and froh ( or total length of roh segments ) was 0.78 ( 0.77 when the individual with maximum inbreeding coefficient and total length of roh segments was removed ) ( fig. 4 ) while the correlation between number and total length of roh segments was 0.79 and that between fpedigree and number of roh segments was 0.57 ( with or without the individual with maximum inbreeding coefficient ) .
the slope of the regression of froh onto fpedigree was 0.94 ( s.e. 0.028 ) .
the characteristics of froh within the role and coat colour groups were generally similar to those for the full dataset , although chocolate dogs and showdogs were somewhat distinct and both had higher values of froh than the other groups .
mean values of froh for the three coat colour groups were the following : 0.20 ( se 1.2e - 04 ) for black , 0.23 ( 5.7e - 04 ) for chocolate and 0.21 ( 2.8e - 04 ) for yellow ; for the three role groups : 0.20 ( 1.3 e - 04 ) for gundogs , 0.21 ( 2.0 e - 04 ) for pets and 0.26 ( 1.6 e - 04 ) for showdogs .
the correlation coefficients between fpedigree and froh for the three coat colour groups were the following : 0.79 ( black ) , 0.74 ( chocolate ) and 0.77 ( yellow ) ; for the three role groups : 0.76 ( gundogs ) , 0.81 ( pets ) and 0.84 ( showdogs ) .
the slopes of the regression of froh onto fpedigree for the three coat colour groups were the following : 0.96 ( se 0.036 ) for black , 0.89 ( 0.075 ) for chocolate and 0.97 ( 0.059 ) for yellow ; for the three role groups : 0.99 ( 0.046 ) for gundogs , 0.97 ( 0.041 ) for pets and 0.87 ( 0.086 ) for showdogs. fig. 4 relationship between pedigree - based ( fpedigree ) and genomic - based ( froh ) inbreeding coefficients for uk labrador retrievers , details in the main text : a dogs labelled by coat colour ( black , yellow , chocolate ) ; b dogs labelled by role ( gundog , showdog , pet ; dogs labelled as " unknown " or " other " are not shown on the plot ) the longest roh in the genome (~ 115 mb ) was found on cfa1 in the most inbred individual ( a female , chocolate showdog ) in the study .
rohs covered by > 400 ( 55 %) individuals were found on cfa1 and cfa11 .
the rohs that were shared by the largest number of dogs ( 581 ) were defined by snps on cfa11 ( cfa11:42,380,188 - 42,480,533 ) , a region that does not include any annotated genes ( the closest gene is elavl2 , which encodes a neural - specific rna - binding protein ) .
other regions of high roh coverage (> 300 dogs , 41 %) were found on cfa5 , 24 , 25 , 32 and 35 .
genomic differentiation between genetic clusters we identified regions of the genome showing the greatest levels of differentiation ( based on fst ) between the groupings highlighted in the population structure analyses .
having identified that k = 2 was the best estimate of cluster number , individuals were chosen for the differentiation analysis based on their membership coefficient for the two clusters from the k = 2 structure analysis .
individuals were initially selected with extreme membership coefficients (> 0.90 ) and that were classified as either showdog or gundog ; half - siblings were then removed , which left 115 " cluster 1 " dogs ( gundogs ) and 27 " cluster 2 " dogs ( showdogs ) .
in order to fairly compare cluster 1 and cluster 2 , 27 cluster 1 dogs with the highest membership coefficients were selected for differentiation analysis ( average membership coefficient for cluster 1 = 0.996 , for cluster 2 = 0.972 ) .
the top 0.05 % of fst - windows ( over all three window sizes ) encompassed 20 regions on 12 chromosomes ( table 2 ) .
there were more regions identified for fst - window - 9 than the other two window sizes .
the regions identified for the larger window sizes were generally a subset of those identified for fst - windows - 9 ( the exceptions were cfa6:24.56 mb , cfa13:4.88 - 5.08 mb and cfa17:25.80 mb , which were not seen in the fst - windows - 9 analysis ) .
the maximum fst - windows values for each window size were identified as the top 24 values : fst - windows - 9 values > 0.700 , fst - windows - 13 > 0.619 , fst - windows values - 17 > 0.602 .
protein - coding genes found within 0.5 mb of the highly differentiated regions are shown in additional file 3 .
in the go enrichment analysis , none of the biological processes reached significance after correction for multiple testing due to the large number of background genes tested ; however , the process with the lowest p - value was " regulation of anatomical structure morphogenesis " ( p = 1.79e - 04 ) , which showed ~ 6 - fold enrichment .
table 2 genomic regions showing the highest levels of differentiation ( top 0.05 % of fst - windows - 9 , - 13 and - 17 ) between the two clusters identified by structure ( k = 2 ) : for each region including markers in the upper tail of the respective fst - windows distribution , the maximum of fst - windows values for the region is presented ( italicized values in cells with diagonal lines indicate that the region did not feature in the extreme of the fst - windows distribution for that window size ) .
regions were defined to incorporate neighbouring markers within 1 - mb distance the total length of rohs was greater for the 27 cluster 2 dogs ( mean = 615,062 ) than the 27 cluster 1 dogs ( mean = 532,892 ) described above ( p = 0.009 ) .
this difference was still significant ( p = 0.002 ) when the most highly inbred dog ( a cluster 2 dog , extreme value on fig. 4 ) was removed from the analysis .
there was not a strong correspondence between the differentiated regions and the rohs .
however , five of the 20 highly differentiated regions coincided with 12 " overlapping " rohs , those found in multiple individuals ( where the overlap involved > 2 snps ) .
for all 12 of these overlapping segments , there was a significant association between cluster membership ( defined by membership coefficient to cluster 1 : " low " refers to <= 0.5 , " high " refers to > 0.5 ) and roh grouping , as defined by the alleles at individual snps ( p < 0.001 ) .
discussion within - breed genetic differentiation an important tool in the genetic characterization of domesticated animal species is the application of statistical methods that group individuals into clusters without prior population labelling .
in most cases , studies have demonstrated good correspondence between breeds and genetically - defined populations such that use of this approach can be particularly useful for identifying animals that do not fit the general genetic profile of a given breed , for example , cross - bred or misclassified individuals [ 41 ] .
in some cases , however , clustering techniques have revealed population structure below the breed level , such as that seen in our analysis of the uk labrador retriever population , where both the structure and pca analyses indicated genetic subdivision into two groups .
these groups were associated with the role of the dog : working (" field " , " gun ") dogs and show (" conformation ") dogs , while pets were a mixture of both types .
there was also genetic differentiation between chocolate ( brown ) and both yellow and black dogs , with chocolate dogs primarily found in the showdog cluster .
the proportion of variance explained by the first principal component ( 6.8 %) , which was strongly associated with the role factor , is similar to the level seen in clustering of geographically - related human populations ( e.g. populations from the middle east and east asia [ 42 ]) ; its moderately low value indicates that while there is clear differentiation within the breed , a large proportion of the genetic variation is accounted for by unknown factors .
within - breed differentiation has been previously demonstrated in livestock species , including the british saddleback pig breed [ 43 ] , italian autochthonous donkeys [ 44 ] , southwestern european goats [ 45 ] and british chicken breeds [ 41 ] .
several studies in dogs have also identified within - breed differentiation , which appears to derive from several sources .
a similar case to the labrador retriever is the border collie [ 46 ] , where working dogs were shown to be genetically differentiated from showdogs .
however , most cases of within - dog - breed differentiation appear to be associated with geographical distance ( unlike our study ) or clear physical characteristics .
quignon et al .
[ 47 ] analysed american and european samples from four breeds and demonstrated a clear genetic separation of us and eu golden retrievers .
bjornerfeldt et al .
[ 48 ] identified strong genetic differentiation in poodles due to size and coat colour .
standard poodles were clearly genetically distinct from all other poodles , while the smaller poodles were differentiated from each other based on a combination of size and coat colour .
a study on schnauzer breeds revealed a similar pattern of differentiation [ 49 ] such that giant schnauzers were strongly differentiated from the other schnauzer breeds , while the smaller schnauzers clustered based on both coat colour and size .
mellanby et al .
[ 50 ] also demonstrated genetic structure within uk cavalier king charles spaniels , although the source of the differentiation was not clear .
highly - differentiated genomic regions the fst analysis identified several genomic regions that were strongly genetically differentiated between the two labrador retriever clusters .
as these clusters were associated with both coat colour and classification / role of the dog ( i.e. gundog , showdog ) , we investigated the differentiated regions for the presence of genes that could be related to these groupings .
the regions did not include either of the two genes known to determine coat colour in labrador retrievers ( tyrp1 , cfa9:12,685,439 - 12,710,290 , and mc1r , cfa16 : 89,912,119 - 89,920,977 ) , suggesting that the stratification has not primarily been driven by selection for coat colour .
regarding the role groups , there are morphological features that are known to differ between gundogs and showdogs .
showdogs tend to have heavier builds , with shorter legs compared to gundogs .
in terms of head shape , showdogs tend to have shorter muzzles and slightly wider heads [ 51 , 52 ] .
the 20 differentiated regions did not include any of the six genes that have been associated with body size in between - dog - breed studies [ 53 ] .
the regions did , however , include several genes that have been associated with craniofacial development and this finding was further supported by the results of the go analysis of biological processes in which " anatomical structure morphogenesis " showed the strongest evidence of enrichment in the differentiated regions .
furthermore , two of the regions , on chromosomes 9 and 24 , were located within 1 mb of snps previously associated with canine skull shape in a between - breed gwas study [ 54 ] , suggesting that the genetic differentiation between the clusters may in part be related to this phenotype .
the cfa9 region is of particular interest : it overlaps an orthologous chromosomal region on human chromosome 17p in which deletions of various sizes are associated with miller - dieker syndrome ( mds ) , a congenital malformation associated with brain and craniofacial disorders ( including lissencephaly , " smooth brain ") [ 55 ] .
deletions involving several of the highly differentiated genes in this region have been suggested to contribute to mds , including pafah1b1 ( the primary lissencephaly - related gene , also known as lis1 , cfa9:46,647,994 - 46,727,422 ) , mnt ( cfa9:46,466,709 - 46,482,614 ) and smg6 ( cfa9:46,161,531 - 46,405,748 ) [ 56 - 58 ] .
in addition , the hic1 gene , located just outside the differentiated region ( cfa9:46,159,464 - 46,162,004 ) , functions as a growth regulator and has also been associated with mds and craniofacial development .
hic1 - deficient mice were shown to carry developmental abnormalities , including several craniofacial defects , acrania ( partial or complete absence of the flat bones in the cranial vault ) , exencephaly ( brain located outside of the skull ) and underdeveloped ear [ 59 ] .
hic1 was also strongly associated with cleft palate in a genome - wide association study of humans [ 60 ] .
other genes in the differentiated regions include alx3 ( cfa6:41,903,464 - 41,906,963 ) and cdk14 ( cfa14:16,440,408 - 17,007,553 ) , both of which have been associated with craniofacial development [ 61 , 62 ] .
behavioural characteristics have also been shown to differ between gundogs and showdogs in the labrador retriever breed [ 63 , 64 ] .
while some of the genes in the differentiated regions are associated with neuronal or neurological function , we are not aware of any associations with behavioural traits .
however , as the genetics of behaviour is still in its early stages and there is little evidence to definitively connect specific genes to these traits , we cannot conclude that these regions do not influence dog behavioural characteristics .
only five of the 20 highly differentiated regions coincided with overlapping rohs that were shared across individuals , suggesting that selection for cluster - related phenotypes is not strongly associated with extended homozygosity in the genome .
however , for the overlapping rohs that did coincide with differentiation regions , there was a significant association between cluster membership and roh grouping , as defined by the alleles at individual snps , so it may be the case that some rohs are related to selection for cluster - related phenotypes .
genomic characterisation of inbreeding this study demonstrates the great potential for using genomic data to estimate inbreeding levels in domesticated animal species .
the concept of using regions of homozygosity to estimate inbreeding levels dates back to 1999 [ 65 ] and it was first applied in humans [ 66 , 67 ] .
this approach has been applied to livestock in numerous studies [ 68 - 73 ] but only recently in dogs [ 74 , 75 ] .
other genomic approaches to estimation of inbreeding have been implemented ( e.g. diagonal elements of the genomic relationship matrix ) but the roh approach appears to be less influenced by allele frequencies and thus more accurate [ 68 , 76 ] .
our analysis revealed a high correlation between fpedigree and froh ( 0.78 ) , while some studies in cattle and pigs have shown lower correlations , for example , 0.015 in brazilian landrace pigs and 0.24 in brazilian large white pigs [ 69 ] ; 0.47 in danish jersey cattle and 0.49 in danish red cattle [ 68 ] .
these correlations could have been influenced by the quality of either or both the pedigree - and genomic - based estimates and may have been influenced by the effective population sizes and / or depth of pedigree of the studied populations .
further studies in dogs will be required to develop the optimal approach ( es ) for estimating inbreeding based on roh data , which may be breed - specific ( i.e. influenced by the age and level of inbreeding within individual breeds ) .
considerations include specification of the parameters to use in defining rohs as well as determination of the most useful range of roh lengths to consider in the calculation of froh .
both pedigree - and genomic - based estimates of effective population size were somewhat lower than those published previously for labrador retrievers .
our pedigree - based estimate for the full dataset ( 54.5 ) was lower than that published by the kc ( 81.7 , for the period 1980 - 2014 [ 18 ]) , although almost identical ( 82.3 ) when animals with f = 0 were removed ; it was also considerably lower than an earlier pedigree - based estimate ( 114 ) [ 77 ] .
the range of genomic estimates ( 74 - 88 ) was also highly consistent with the kc estimate .
thus a genomic approach to estimation of effective population size shows great promise , especially in situations where the depth of pedigree is low and thus pedigree - based estimates are likely to be poor .
conclusions this study demonstrated that the uk labrador retriever population showed evidence of genetic stratification into two groups , one of which was primarily associated with working dogs and the other with showdogs ; pet dogs were a mixture of both types .
genetic differentiation was also seen between the three main coat colour types , with chocolate dogs primarily associated with the showdog grouping .
identification of the genomic regions showing the greatest differentiation between the two sub - populations provided evidence that this stratification is related to morphological differences between showdogs and working dogs .
specifically , the differentiated regions included several genes associated with craniofacial development , which may contribute to the differences in head shape between the two groups .
this study also found that the total length of homozygous segments ( runs of homozygosity , rohs ) was highly correlated with the pedigree - based inbreeding coefficient .

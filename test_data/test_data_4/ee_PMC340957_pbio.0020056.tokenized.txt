engineered biosynthesis of regioselectively modified aromatic polyketides using bimodular polyketide synthases faced with new and ongoing threats to public health , researchers are becoming increasingly resourceful in their quest to discover new drugs .
drug researchers have long looked to living organisms for inspiration , either mimicking or extracting chemical formulas from naturally occurring compounds .
bacteria and fungi , for example , produce a wide range of compounds - - some of which give them a selective advantage in their own environments - - that provide important pharmaceutical activities .
one class of these natural compounds are the polyketides , which make up a large portion of the antibiotics ( including erythromycin and tetracycline ) and antitumor drugs ( such as doxorubicin and epothilone ) that have been isolated from various microorganisms .
polyketides are synthesized by bacteria and fungi by the appropriately named polyketide synthases ( pkss ) .
pkss can be thought of as large molecular factories containing a series of enzymes working on an assembly line : each enzyme in the line adds molecules to a primer , or starter , unit - - which is usually an acetate molecule - - and then hands off the growing chain to the next enzyme .
the specific enzymes set all the characteristics of the polyketide , including the chain length , the building blocks used , and the branching pattern of the molecules .
although microorganisms generate polyketides with a variety of characteristics , one goal of drug discovery research is to increase this diversity even further - - a larger pool of polyketides promises more drugs with enhanced pharmaceutical applications .
early attempts at creating artificial polyketides focused on altering the functional characteristics of naturally occurring polyketides - - the length of the chain , the building blocks , and the patterns of the branches .
chaitan khosla and colleagues have taken this approach one very large step further .
rather than changing the machinery to modify the growing structure of a polyketide , they engineered bacteria to use an alternative , nonacetate primer molecule .
this has important practical implications because some medicinally significant compounds do not use the usual acetate primer unit. by dissecting out the specificities of the " starter " and longer , multiunit " elongation " pks enzymes and by mixing and matching modules , they have produced novel polyketide analogs ( in this case , of anthraquinone ) with more effective medically relevant properties .
one of the compounds they engineered shows enhanced efficacy in blocking the growth of breast cancer cells that depend on the activity of the estrogen receptor , while a second polyketide inhibits an enzyme linked to adult - onset diabetes , demonstrating just two possible new therapeutic applications for synthesized polyketides .
but , as the authors propose , this method promises to reveal new pharmaceutical agents that have n't even been discovered yet .

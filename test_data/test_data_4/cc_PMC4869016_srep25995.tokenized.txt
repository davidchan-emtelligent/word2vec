we show that conventional soliton , dispersion - managed ( dm ) soliton ( stretched - pulse ) and dissipative soliton mode - locking regimes can be reliably targeted by changing the filter 's dispersion and bandwidth only , while no changes are made to the physical layout of the laser cavity .
numerical simulations are presented which confirm the different nonlinear pulse evolutions inside the laser cavity .
the proposed technique holds great potential for achieving a high degree of control over the dynamics and output of ultrafast fibre lasers , in contrast to the traditional method to control the pulse formation mechanism in a dm fibre laser , which involves manual optimisation of the relative length of fibres with opposite - sign dispersion in the cavity .
our versatile ultrafast fibre laser will be attractive for applications requiring different pulse profiles such as in optical signal processing and optical communications .
passively mode - locked fibre lasers have been intensively investigated due to their potential for realising reliable and cost - effective compact ultrafast light sources123 .
nonlinear effects are usually quite large in mode - locked fibre lasers , but the interplay among the effects of gain / loss , dispersion and nonlinearity can also be used to shape the pulses and manipulate and control the light dynamics and , hence , lead to different regimes of mode locking .
when the group - velocity dispersion ( gvd ) of the laser is anomalous , pulses form by a balance between positive nonlinear and negative dispersive phase changes , and the resulting pulse propagates indefinitely without change .
before 1993 , researchers operated fibre lasers almost exclusively with large net anomalous gvd , in the soliton - like regime45 .
the energy achievable in such laser systems is limited to some tens of picojoules in single - mode fibre ( smf ) by the soliton area theorem .
in a laser with segments of large and nearly equal magnitudes of gvd but with opposite signs ( referred to as a dispersion map ) , a pulse will stretch and compress and the nonlinear phase is exactly balanced by the net effect of dispersion .
this stretched - pulse or dispersion - managed ( dm ) soliton operation678 exists for net anomalous or small normal gvd and allows ultrashort pulses with up to nanojoule energies .
recent work9 has shown that much higher pulse energies can be achieved in fibre lasers that operate at large normal dispersion .
in the normal - dispersion regime , to compensate nonlinear phase and avoid wave - breaking phenomena , dissipation is required and plays a key role in the pulse shaping .
the similariton regime existing in dm cavities with large normal gvd features parabolic pulses that evolve self - similarly in a long segment of passive fibre10 .
these pulses linearise the nonlinear phase in the normal - dispersion fibre , which is compensated by an anomalous - gvd segment .
parabolic amplifier similaritons have also been stabilised in a fibre oscillator11121314 .
the amplifier similariton laser relies on a local nonlinear attraction to stabilise the pulse in the cavity , while spectral filtering plays an important supporting role by undoing the large spectral broadening after the gain segment .
it is worth to mention that the soliton - similariton laser reported in refs 11 and 12 is the only example of mode - locked laser so far that has two types of nonlinear waves propagating within the cavity .
in cavities with only normal - dispersion components or strong net normal dispersion1516171819 , the resulting dissipative solitons ( dss ) balance nonlinear phase accumulations by spectral or gain filtering of a highly chirped pulse in the laser cavity .
to date , the best energy performance from smf lasers has been achieved with this mode - locking mechanism .
techniques for generating , controlling and manipulating ultrashort optical pulses and specialised waveforms20 have become increasingly important in many scientific areas , including , amongst others , ultrahigh - speed optical communications , optical signal processing and bio - photonics .
versatile ultrafast laser sources , which can selectively emit different types of nonlinear waves , are highly desirable in this context .
different regimes of pulse generation at net anomalous or normal dispersion can be realised in a dm fibre laser via appropriate in - cavity dispersion management21222324 .
commonly employed methods to achieve flexible control of in - cavity dispersion include grating pairs2425 , prisms , or simply physically changing the length of the fibre in the cavity212223 .
furthermore , the possibility to achieve both parabolic self - similar and triangular pulse shaping in a mode - locked fibre laser via adjustment of the net normal dispersion and integrated gain of the cavity was reported in ref .
26. in ref .
27 , careful control of the gain / loss parameters of a net - normal dispersion laser cavity provided the means of achieving switching among gaussian pulse , ds and similariton pulse solutions in the cavity .
all these techniques however , require manual tuning of some physical parameters of the cavity .
spectral pulse shaping28 is a technique that employs spectral manipulation of the intensity and phase components of a pulse in order to create the desired field distribution .
recently , the inclusion of a spectral pulse shaper into the cavity of a mode - locked fibre laser has emerged as a method to achieve a potentially high degree of control over the dynamics and the output of the laser293031323334 , while obviously entailing a more power efficient technique than pulse shaping implemented through direct filtering of a laser output .
fully programmable phase and amplitude filters35 are already commercially available and extensively used in telecommunications applications36 .
the use of such filters , when placed inside a laser cavity , has the potential to allow the operation of lasers that exhibit pulse characteristics that can be controlled purely through software control .
this method was demonstrated to allow for tuneability of the laser wavelength and laser operation at high repetition rates29 .
in refs 30 and 31 , the phase - filtering ability of an in - cavity pulse shaper was shown to enable precise control of the cavity dispersion of the laser as well as to change the output pulse train from bright to dark pulses .
in ref .
32 , it was numerically shown that a passively mode - locked fibre laser can operate in different pulse - shaping regimes , including bright and dark parabolic , flat - top , triangular , and saw - tooth waveform generations , depending on the amplitude profile of an in - cavity spectral filter .
furthermore , an application of this technique using a flat - top spectral filter was numerically demonstrated to achieve the direct generation of high - quality sinc - shaped optical nyquist pulses with widely tuneable bandwidth from a passively mode - locked fibre laser33 .
an experimental demonstration of nyquist pulse generation from a regeneratively and harmonically mode - locked fibre laser with a spectral pulse - shaping filter installed in the cavity was reported in ref .
34. in this paper , we report on a versatile erbium - doped fibre ( edf ) laser in which soliton , dm soliton , and ds mode - locking regimes can be selectively and reliably established by programming different gvd profiles and bandwidths on an in - cavity programmable filter .
the generation and in - cavity evolution of the different pulses are confirmed by a numerical analysis .
we would like to note that the aim of our proof - of - concept experiment is not to achieve laser output performances that exceed those of standard fibre lasers .
instead , we aim to demonstrate the novel possibility of adaptively controlling the pulse formation mechanism in a mode - locked fibre laser by inclusion of a programmable filter in the laser cavity .
each of the mode - locking regimes achieved in our laser obviously takes on major practical importance .
for example , soliton lasers are finding widespread applications as absolutely turnkey ultrafast laser sources in industrial environments .
dm solitons are very attractive for super - continuum generation owing to their ultrashort pulse duration and broad spectrum37 .
dss with high energy and chirp can simplify chirped - pulse amplification systems when serving as a seed source16 .
to our knowledge , this is the first time that these distinctly different pulse solutions are obtained in a single laser system without applying any physical changes in the layout of the laser cavity .
the programmable - filter - based technique presented in this paper greatly relaxes the need for employing opposite - sign dispersion fibres and fibre length optimisation in order to achieve the desired pulse - shaping regime in ultrafast fibre lasers .
results and discussion setup and experimental results the laser setup in the ring cavity configuration is shown in fig. 1. a 1.2 - m long segment of edf with nominal absorption coefficient of ~ 52 db / m at 976 nm and normal gvd beta2 = 65.05 fs2 / mm at 1550 nm was used as the gain medium .
this fibre was pumped through a 980 / 1550 wavelength - division multiplexer ( wdm ) by a 976 - nm laser diode , which could provide up to 300 mw optical power .
an in - fibre polarisation - dependent isolator ( pdi ) sandwiched with two polarisation controllers ( pcs ) , converted nonlinear polarisation rotation ( npr ) to amplitude modulation , initiating and stabilising mode - locked operation3839 , and it also ensured single direction oscillation .
additional anomalous - dispersion fibre associated with the various components of the laser cavity amounted to a length of ~ 8 m. a programmable liquid - crystal - on - silicon ( lcos ) phase and amplitude filter35 was used to realise different regimes of pulse generation in the cavity .
( further details can be found in the methods. ) under mode - locking conditions , the laser operated at a repetition period of 89 ns ( fig. 2 ) , which remained constant throughout the experiments described below ( since there was no change in the optical length of the cavity ) .
the net dispersion of the cavity was adaptively managed by changing the curvature of the parabolic spectral phase profile of the filter ( see methods ) .
as pulse formation at net anomalous or slightly normal gvd does not depend on spectral filtering , for such dispersion regimes the amplitude filtering ability of the filter was not used : we employed the default flat - top filter 's shape with the maximum achievable bandwidth of 9 thz ( 73 nm ) .
on the other hand , for operation of the laser in the strong net - normal dispersion regime , the filter was programmed to have a narrow - bandwidth gaussian spectral profile , as detailed below .
a filter 's central wavelength of 1555 nm was used for all dispersion regimes at play .
two 90:10 fibre couplers were employed to tap 10 % of laser power out of the cavity , where one was for laser outputs after the npr components ; the other one was located after the programmable filter for investigating the pulse dynamics inside the laser cavity .
the output port was connected by a 3 - m long segment of anomalous - dispersion smf ( beta2 = - 22.8 fs2 / mm ) to an optical spectrum analyser , an auto - correlator and a fast photodetector ( 1 - ghz bandwidth ) connected to an oscilloscope ( 2 - ghz bandwidth ) to characterise the pulses .
when there was no dispersion applied on the programmable filter , the cavity had an anomalous net dispersion. by properly adjusting the two pcs in the system , stable mode - locked pulses could be obtained .
a typical pulse train as observed on the oscilloscope is shown in fig. 2. in this example , the average pulse power after the smf of the laser output port was 0.15 mw. the black curve in the left panel of fig. 3 shows the corresponding optical spectrum profile at the laser output , centred at ~ 1560 nm and with a spectral bandwidth at full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 4.7 nm. the presence of distinct kelly sidebands40 in the spectrum indicates the fundamental soliton shape of the output pulse .
the net dispersion of the cavity , calculated from the sidebands , is - 0.3967 ps2 ( at 1555 nm ) .
note that because the filter bandwidth is wide and the filter 's shape is flat , the filter has negligible effect on soliton generation ; thereby the central wavelength of the soliton is only determined by gain / loss in the laser and deviates from that of the filter .
the black curve in the right panel of fig. 3 shows the measured autocorrelation trace of the pulse corresponding to a fwhm pulse duration of 0.8 ps when a hyperbolic secant fit is assumed .
this gives a time - bandwidth product ( tbp ) of 0.46 ( at 1560 nm ) , indicating that the pulse is slightly chirped .
we attribute it to the gvd of the smf of the laser output port .
the soliton - like single - pulse generation regime was observed for a pump power of 20 to 26 mw ( fig. 4 ) , and bore an average output power of 0.12 to 0.21 mw corresponding to a pulse energy 10.7 to 18.7 pj. when some normal dispersion was applied on the filter while keeping the net cavity dispersion anomalous , the spectral width of the pulses increased , which is in agreement with soliton - type pulse behaviour41 .
next , we applied a dispersion of 0.385 ps2 ( at 1555 nm ) on the filter to shift the net cavity gvd close to zero value .
in this case , after adjustment of the pcs , the laser generated pulses ( fig. 3 , red curves ) with kelly sideband - free , wide spectrum , which is a signature of the dm soliton operation regime .
the spectral width at fwhm is around 25 nm. an even wider output pulse spectrum was obtained by establishing the net gvd to be slightly normal41 ( 0.014 ps2 ) .
single - pulse dm soliton mode locking existed under a pump power of 28.5 to 42 mw ( fig. 4 ) , and bore an average output power of 0.24 to 0.41 mw , yielding a pulse energy of 21 to 36 pj , which is significantly higher than that of soliton - like mode locking .
the autocorrelation trace of the pulse with 0.20 mw average power after the smf of the laser output port indicates a fwhm pulse duration of 2.78 ps when a gaussian fit is assumed , which results in a tbp of 8.62 ( at 1555 nm ) .
it is well known that dss occur in all - normal1516 or strong net - normal171819 dispersion cavities .
in our laser design , strong net - normal dispersion can be achieved by configuring the dispersion of the in - cavity filter ; meanwhile , the filter bandwidth also needs to be properly controlled as dss require additional amplitude modulation besides saturable absorber action915 .
furthermore , a gaussian spectral profile was programmed on the filter , as the default flat - top profile is similar to the shape of the ds spectrum .
self - starting mode - locked operation was achieved by adjustment of the pcs with a filter bandwidth at fwhm of 0.8 thz .
no stable mode - locked pulses were found for larger bandwidths , consistently with the discussion above .
the blue curves in fig. 3 give the characterisations of the laser output obtained for a filter 's dispersion of 0.8986 ps2 , yielding a net gvd of 0.502 ps2 in the cavity , and 0.48 - mw average pulse power after the smf of the output port .
the output pulse spectrum is steep at the edges and has a dip in the top , typical characteristics of ds lasing915 .
the spectral width at fwhm is 9.7 nm. incidentally , we also note that the spectrum is centred at the central wavelength of the filter , which confirms the ability of an in - cavity programmable filter to tune the laser wavelength29 .
the pulse autocorrelation trace corresponds to a fwhm pulse duration of 3.5 ps when a gaussian fit is assumed .
this gives a tbp of 4.21 ( at 1555 nm ) , indicating that the pulse is highly chirped inside the cavity915 .
the average output power for the ds mode - locking regime was 0.45 to 0.69 mw under the pump power 56.5 to 72 mw ( fig. 4 ) , giving a pulse energy 39 to 61 pj. laser generated dss were found to exist in the net cavity dispersion range 0.245 to 0.502 ps2 , and their spectral width decreased when the in - cavity gvd was increased , as it was expected .
in fig. 4 we summarised results for the scaling of the laser output power with pump power for the different pulse - generation regimes .
it is seen that the ds regime features the highest pumping threshold for mode locking and , correspondingly , the highest output pulse energy , in accordance with previous findings .
the efficiency of power transfer from the pump to the laser signal , indicated by the slope of the curves in fig. 4 , is also highest for the ds regime , owing to the large chirp of the pulses in the cavity .
at a first glance it might seem strange that the soliton regime exhibits higher power transfer efficiency than dm soliton lasing .
however , this accords well with the fact that the dm soliton spectrum is so wide that it saturates the gain bandwidth of the edf ; this in turn results in less efficiency .
for each pulse - generation regime and a fixed dispersion applied on the programmable filter , increasing the pump power beyond the maximum value bearable by single - pulse mode locking resulted in multiple pulse generation , which also led to pulse bound states .
these regimes of emission have been intensively investigated in fibre lasers with anomalous and normal net cavity dispersion424344 .
when the pump power was increased further the laser operated in a noise - like pulsing mode .
it is also to be appreciated that when the laser operates in a given pulse - shaping regime , changing the net cavity gvd does not destroy mode locking as long as the laser is still in its original regime .
however , switching among the different regimes needs adjustment of the pc settings and pump power .
on the other hand , the laser can no longer be mode locked when the cavity dispersion is larger than the upper boundary of the dispersion region where dss exist in the system .
numerical simulations to gain insight into the pulse dynamics inside this fibre laser cavity , we performed numerical simulations of the laser based on a non - distributed model solving every part by the nonlinear schrodinger equation .
the laser configuration used in the simulations was the same as the experimental setup .
to account for additional length of anomalous - dispersion fibre in the cavity , we included two segments of smf after the saturable absorber ( sa ) element and the filter , respectively .
parameters were chosen to match the experimental values .
further details can be found in the methods .
example pulse solutions obtained after the smf of the laser output port in the three pulse - generation regimes are shown in figs 5 and 6 , showing the simulated pulses and spectra , respectively .
the respective net gvd of the cavity was - 0.397 ps2 , 0 ps2 and 0.502 ps2 , which are similar values to those of the experimental results in fig. 3. there is a qualitative fairly good agreement between the simulated and experimental pulse modes of operation and spectral profiles .
furthermore , the temporal durations of the simulated pulses agree well with those measured in the experiment .
the soliton - like pulse has fwhm temporal and spectral widths of 0.88 ps and 2.87 nm , yielding a tbp of 0.314 , which almost equals the transform limit for a hyperbolic secant pulse ; the temporal and spectral widths of the dm soliton pulse are 2.64 ps and 26.1 nm , yielding a tbp of 8.53 , and the ds features 3.57 - ps pulse width and 10.3 - nm bandwidth , thus a tbp of 4.54 .
these values are close to the experimental ones .
the in - cavity pulse evolution is illustrated by plots of the root - mean - square ( rms ) pulse duration and spectral bandwidth as functions of position in the cavity ( fig. 7 ) .
distinctly different types of evolutions can be seen from this figure .
the soliton - like pulse is nearly static in the cavity , with both temporal and spectral breathing ratios ( defined as the ratios of maximum and minimum rms widths within a round - trip in the cavity ) of only 1.2 .
the dm soliton experiences the largest temporal and spectral breathing , with the respective breathing ratios 7.5 and 1.8 .
this is typical of the dm mode of operation45 .
this pulse temporally stretches and compresses three times per round - trip , reaches a minimum duration in the middle of each of edf and two smf segments , and acquires both signs of chirp .
the fact that in our laser cavity the pulse stretches and compresses three times per round - trip instead of twice as within typical dm soliton fibre lasers678 stems from the presence of a spectral filter with normal dispersion between two segments of fibre with anomalous dispersion .
indeed , the filter imparts a positive chirp onto the negatively chirped pulse at the exit of the first anomalous segment , thereby temporally compressing the pulse .
the resultant positively chirped pulse experiences further compression in the second anomalous segment up to the point where the chirp is completely cancelled .
the mode - locked pulse at large net - normal dispersion exhibits the features of a ds with an evolution defined by the dispersion map18 .
the evolution in each fibre segment is monotonic , the pulse duration increases in the edf segment and decreases in the smf segments , and the spectrum , cut away by the filter , grows back in the fibre sections .
the pulse is positively chirped throughout the cavity , and it depends strongly on dissipative effects such as the spectral filter and the sa. the different roles played by spectral filtering in the dm soliton and ds mode - locking regimes are evident : in the dm soliton regime , the large filter has nearly no effect on the pulse spectrum , while the pulse is temporally compressed by the effect of the normal dispersion applied on the filter .
in the ds regime , by contrast , the narrow filter cuts away the spectral structure and , consequently , the pulse duration is increased .
conclusion at the level of fundamental research , mode - locked lasers constitute an ideal platform for the investigation of original and complex nonlinear dynamics of ultrashort pulses , while at the applied research level , pulses with different and optimised features - e.g. , in terms of pulse duration , temporal and / or spectral shape , width , energy , repetition rate and emission bandwidth - are sought with the general constraint of developing efficient cavity architectures .
in these two aspects , fibre laser cavities , which offer compact and versatile design , represent an area of intense development .
a number of experimental demonstrations have proved the ability of an in - cavity spectral pulse shaper based on a programmable optical processor to provide a high degree of control over the dynamics and the output of mode - locked fibre lasers29303134 .
a completely different method to externally control the in - cavity dynamics of mode - locked fibre lasers , based on using an evolutionary algorithm to search pulsed regimes in the laser cavity , has also been recently reported46 .
our work fits into this research area through the development of a versatile ultrafast passively mode - locked edf laser in which the pulse formation mechanism can be flexibly controlled by an in - cavity programmable filter .
we have demonstrated for the first time to the best of our knowledge that conventional solitons , dm solitons and dss can be selected and reliably targeted in a single laser by adaptively changing the dispersion and bandwidth programmed on the in - cavity filter .
we have confirmed the different regimes of pulse generation experimentally and by numerical simulations .
the transitions among the different pulse - shaping regimes are easily reconfigurable , and inherently interesting in the field of ultrafast optics owing to their vastly different characteristics .
the combination of two mature technologies - linear shaping and fibre laser - demonstrated in this paper offers new technological opportunities and paves the way for the generation of more advanced waveforms .
this multifunction ultrashort - pulse fibre laser source has a great potential for several applications , such as optical communications and signal processing , and can also be readily implemented at different wavelength regions , such as at the two microns region , where suitable dispersion - compensating fibres are still under development .
we also emphasize that linear shaping is now readily available at one micron for the ytterbium - fibre - based technology .
this could be exploited to scale up the output energy of the laser .
moreover , as far as the energy performance enhancement is concerned , our laser could be used as the master laser in a master - oscillator - power - amplifier ( mopa ) system .
in a mopa configuration , the possibility of changing the operating regime of the seed laser may be interesting for engineering the following high - gain amplification stage .
methods numerical simulations of pulse propagation within the fibre sections were based on a standard modified nonlinear schrodinger equation47 : here psi = psi ( z , t ) is the slowly - varying amplitude of the pulse envelope , z is the propagation coordinate , t is the time delay parameter , beta2 is the gvd parameter and gamma is the coefficient of cubic nonlinearity for the fibre section .
the dissipative terms represent linear gain as well as a parabolic approximation to the gain profile with the bandwidth omega .
the gain is described by g = g ( z ) = g0 /( 1 + w / w0 ) , where g0 is the small - signal gain ( corresponding to 30 db / m in power ) , which is non - zero only for the gain fibre , is the pulse energy , and w0 is the gain saturation energy determined by the pump power .
to initiate and sustain mode locking of the fibre laser , the npr technique was used in our experiment .
here the mode - locking regime for the sake of clarity was modelled by a simple transfer function47 : t = 1 - q0 - qm /[ 1 + p ( t )/ p0 ] , where q0 is the unsaturated loss due to the absorber , qm is the saturable loss ( modulation depth ) , p ( z , t ) = | psi ( z , t )| 2 is the instantaneous pulse power , and p0 is the saturation power .
the filter was modelled by the spectral response32 : h ( f ) = r ( f ) exp [ ibeta2,acc ( 2pif ) 2 / 2 ] , where the spectral phase added a specific amount of gvd beta2,acc ( in ps2 ) to the cavity to control the net cavity dispersion .
we used a rectangular spectral profile r ( f ) = rect ( f / b ) with the bandwidth b = 9 thz to operate the laser at anomalous or slightly normal dispersion , and a gaussian spectral profile r ( f ) = exp [ - f2 /( 2b2 )] with a fwhm bandwidth of 0.8 thz for the strong net - normal dispersion regime , in accordance with the experiment .
linear losses of 10 % were imposed after the smf segment following the sa and after the filter , which summarised intrinsic losses and output coupling .
the laser output was monitored behind the coupler at the exit of the smf segment following the sa , after further propagation in a 3 - m - long segment of smf as in the case of the experiment .
the parameters used in the numerical simulations were similar to their nominal or estimated experimental values .
we would like to point out that we did not aim here at a comprehensive comparison of numerical modelling and experiments and intentionally considered a simplified description of some key effects .
instead , we used this simple model to highlight the main features of the generated pulse propagation regimes .
the numerical model was solved with a standard symmetric split - step propagation algorithm , and the initial field was a picosecond gaussian temporal profile .
experimentally , the spectral filter was provided by the commercially available wave - shaper fourier - domain programmable optical processor , which allowed for easy reconfiguration of the spectral filter .
a detailed description of the fourier - domain programmable optical processor is given in ref .
35 ; suffice to say here that it works by diffracting the input light onto a two - dimensional lcos array .
applying phase variations across either the horizontal or vertical dimension of the array controls the spectral phase and the intensity , respectively .
the bandwidth of the device is programmable in 1 ghz increments from 20 ghz up to the whole c + l band .

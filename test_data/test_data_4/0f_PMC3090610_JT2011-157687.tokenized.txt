glutathione ( gsh ) is a major player in cellular defense against oxidative stress .
deletion of the modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase ( gclm ) , the first and the rate - limiting enzyme in the synthesis of gsh , leads to significantly lower gsh levels in all tissues including the brain .
gclm - knockout ( gclm - / - ) mice may thus represent a model for compromised response to oxidative stress amenable to in vitro and in vivo investigations .
in order to determine whether the diminished gsh content would by itself cause behavioral alterations , a series of behavioral tests were carried out comparing young adult gclm - / - with wild - type mice .
tests included the rotarod , acoustic startle reflex and prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex , open field behavior , and the platform reversal variant of the morris water maze .
results showed no differences between gclm - / - and wild - type mice in any of the neurobehavioral tests .
however , more subtle alterations , or changes which may appear as animals age , cannot be excluded .
1. introduction oxidative stress refers to the cytotoxic consequences of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , which are generated as byproducts of normal and aberrant metabolic processes that use molecular oxygen .
the tripeptide glutathione ( gsh ; gamma - glutamyl - cysteinyl - glycine ) is one of the most abundant cellular thiols .
gsh is a major player in cellular defense against ros , because it nonenzymatically scavenges both singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals , and is used by glutathione peroxidases and glutathione transferases to limit the levels of certain reactive aldehydes and peroxides within the cell [ 1 , 2 ] .
when ros production exceeds the antioxidant defense capacity of the cell , oxidative stress ensues , leading to the damage of dna , proteins , and membrane lipids .
the first and the rate - limiting step in the synthesis of gsh is carried out by glutamate - cysteine ligase ( gcl ; [ 1 ]) .
the enzyme consists of two subunits , a larger ( 73 kd ) catalytic subunit ( gclc ) and a smaller ( 31 kd ) modifier , or regulatory , subunit ( gclm ) , which are coded by separate genes [ 3 ] .
gclc alone provides catalytic activity and is the site of gsh feedback inhibition. by lowering the k m of gcl for glutamate and raising the k i for gsh , gclm , although enzymatically inactive , plays an important regulatory function , as the holoenzyme ( gclholo ) has higher catalytic efficiency than gclc [ 3 , 4 ] .
while disruption of the gclc gene in mice is embryolethal [ 5 ] , no overt phenotype is observed upon disruption of the gclm gene in mice [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] .
in the absence of gclm , the ability of gclc to synthesize gsh is drastically reduced [ 8 ] .
in tissues from gclm - / - mice , gsh levels are only 10 - 30 % of those found in gclm +/+ animals [ 6 , 7 , 9 ] .
in brain tissue and cells , gsh levels in gclm - / - mice are 17 - 35 % of those present in wild - type mice [ 6 , 10 , 11 ] .
gclm - / - mice are more sensitive to the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen [ 7 ] , and neurons and astrocytes isolated from the brain of gclm - / - mice have been shown to be particularly susceptible to the toxicity of agents that increase oxidative stress , such as domoic acid [ 6 ] , certain organophosphorus insecticides [ 12 ] , methylmercury and pcbs [ 13 ] , and polybrominated diphenyl ethers [ 10 ] .
a relatively common c588t polymorphism has been discovered in the 5 ' - flanking region of the human gclm gene [ 14 ] .
individuals carrying the t allele have a lower promoter activity in a luciferase reporter gene assay in response to oxidants and significantly lower plasma gsh levels [ 14 ] .
these individuals are also at risk for myocardial infarction and present with impairments in nitric oxide - mediated coronary vasomotor function [ 14 , 15 ] .
an association between gclm polymorphisms and schizophrenia has also been suggested [ 16 ] but is still controversial [ 17 , 18 ] .
nevertheless , individuals with gclm polymorphisms leading to lower gsh levels would be expected to display an enhanced sensitivity to the adverse effects of oxidative stress .
the gclm - / - mouse thus represents a useful model for such gclm polymorphisms , amenable for in vitro , as well as in vivo studies .
in order to extend in vitro observations to an in vivo situation , an initial behavioral characterization of gclm - / - mice was carried out , to determine whether the genetically determined diminished gsh level would by itself affect behavioral outcomes .
indeed , glutathione dysregulation is associated with the etiology and progression of several diseases , including neurotoxic and neurodegenerative disorders [ 19 , 20 ] .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
generation of gclm - null mice and genotyping all animal use protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the university of washington , and experiments were carried out in accordance with the national research council guide for the care and use of laboratory animals , as adopted by the national institutes of health .
wild - type and gclm - null ( gclm - / - ) mice of backcrossed c57bl / 6j ( b6.129 ) strain background [ 6 , 7 ] were housed in a centralized , aaalac - accredited , and specific pathogen - free facility at the university of washington .
mice were maintained in a 12 h light - dark cycle with ad libitum access to food ( standard mouse chow ) and water .
male and female mice hemizygous for the gclm deletion ( gclm - hz ) were intercrossed , generating wild - type , gclm - / - , and gclm - hz mice , in the expected mendelian ratios [ 21 ] .
to genotype pups , genomic dna was isolated from ear punch tissue using a qiagen dneasy kit , and mice were genotyped by pcr amplification of the wild - type and disrupted gclm alleles ( i.e. , amplification of beta - geo ) , as previously described [ 6 , 7 ] .
as seen previously , all pups developed normally and exhibited no differences in phenotypic landmarks compared to wild - type littermates .
at weaning , mice were transferred to the neurobehavioral testing facility and housed two to four per cage for the duration of testing .
2.2 .
neurobehavioral assessment one wild - type ( total = 12 ) or gclm - / - ( total = 13 ) male mouse , each taken from a different litter , was used for neurobehavioral testing .
tests were chosen to investigate possible differences between the two mouse genotypes in sensory functions , motor activity and coordination , and learning and memory .
auditory startle and prepulse inhibition of startle were tested at 12 weeks of age using an automated auditory startle chamber ( san diego instruments ) .
during a 15 - minute test session , mice were placed in the startle chamber and presented with 30 stimuli at randomized intervals .
the stimuli consisted of a 120 db tone , a 120 db tone preceded by a 70 db prepulse , or a " null " stimulus involving no tone .
each type of stimulus was presented 10 times .
the order of stimulus presentation was first determined using a random number table , after which each mouse received the stimuli in the same order .
the startle chambers used a piezoelectric sensor to measure the maximum amplitude ( v max ) of the startle response after each stimulus and the latency to the maximum startle response ( t max ) .
prepulse inhibition of startle was calculated as the percent inhibition of the auditory startle response by the 70 db prepulse , after subtracting the startle response to the null stimulus [ 22 , 23 ] .
a rotarod ( coulbourn instruments ) was used to test motor coordination and cerebellar learning [ 24 , 25 ] at 13 weeks of age .
mice were placed on the rotarod cylinder , which accelerated to 5 rpm / min from a baseline rate of 3 rpm .
latency to fall off the cylinder was recorded for each of four successive trials , with a 5 min intertrial interval .
open - field behavior and locomotor activity were tested at 20 weeks of age using a tru - scan photo beam tracking system ( coulbourn instruments , whitehall pa ) .
mice were placed in an open - field arena that was 25.4 cm wide , 25.4 cm deep , and 40.64 cm high , and movements and behaviors were recorded for 15 min using dual sensor rings to measure infrared beam breaks in the horizontal or vertical plane .
beams were spaced 1.52 cm apart , providing 0.76 cm spatial resolution .
data were collected in 30 sec bins , and totals over the 15 min testing period were calculated as the sum of the 30 individual values .
data were also analyzed individually for the first 5 min period , the second 5 - min period , and the third 5 min period .
specific measures included total number of movements , total movement time , total rest time , ambulatory move time , latency to first movement , latency to first ambulatory movement , total movement distance , ambulatory distance , mean velocity , ambulatory velocity , distance traveled in arena margin and arena center , time spent in arena margin and arena center , number of entries into arena center , time spent in back half and front half of arena , number of entries into back half and front half of arena , number of entries into vertical plane , time spent in vertical plane , number of jumps from floor plane , number of movements in vertical plane , number of stereotypic movements , number of stereotypic episodes , total time of stereotypic behavior , and number of counterclockwise and clockwise center point rotations .
data were collected automatically using tru - scan 2.0 software , and raw data were exported for analysis by microsoft excel .
a platform - reversal variant of the morris water maze was used to test learning and memory [ 26 - 28 ] beginning at 14 weeks of age .
this test utilized the polytrack system above .
the maze consisted of a 165 - gallon ( 624.6 liter ) , circular , galvanized stock tank , 4 ft ( 1.22 meter ) in diameter and 2 ft ( 0.61 meter ) in height , filled with room temperature water .
a 10 cm square plexiglass stand was placed in the tank just below the water level to serve as the escape platform .
a polytrack system ( san diego instruments ) was used to track the location of the mice in the maze .
stationary objects surrounding the tank were used as spatial cues .
mice were trained for seven days , three trials per day , at 30 min intertrial intervals , to acquire the task .
on the first trial , mice were dropped randomly at one of the four drop locations and allowed to explore the tank and become familiar with swimming .
mice were then guided to the escape platform and were held on the platform for 30 seconds , and then they were taken out of the tank , dried off , and placed under a heat lamp .
on subsequent trials , mice were dropped into the tank and given 60 seconds to find the platform .
once the mice found and climbed onto the platform , the test was stopped and the latency to find the platform was recorded .
after the 21 - trial acquisition phase , the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant , and mice were tested for an additional 21 trials , with 3 trials per day separated by a 30 min intertrial interval .
latency to find the platform was measured as above .
one month following the last reversal trial , mice were tested for retention using a probe test .
the platform was removed , and mice were placed into the tank at a random drop location and allowed to swim for 2 minutes .
dwell time in each quadrant , average distance from target ( previous location of platform ) , and number of target crossings were recorded .
2.3 .
statistical analysis data were analyzed with microsoft excel .
differences between genotypes were tested for statistical significance by student 's t - test , followed in some cases by a bonferroni correction for multiple testing .
results are reported as mean +/ - se ( n = 12 - 13 ) .
3. results as previously reported [ 6 , 7 ] , gclm - / - mice and wild - type mice were born in the expected mendelian ratios and exhibited no obvious developmental differences during the postnatal developmental period .
adult male and female gclm - / - mice had slightly lower bodyweights than wild - type mice ( table 1 ) .
only male mice were used for behavioral testing .
at 13 weeks of age , motor coordination and cerebellar learning were tested using a rotarod ( figure 1 ) .
wild - type and gclm - / - mice both learned the task , and latency to fall off the rotarod increased with each successive trial ( trial 1 versus trials 2 , 3 , and 4 : wild - type , p < . 05 ; gclm - / - , p < . 01 ) .
there were no significant differences in latency between gclm - / - and wild - type mice on trials one ( p = . 27 ) , two ( p = . 24 ) , three ( p = . 13 ) , or four ( p = . 60 ) , nor when averaging latencies across all four trials ( p = . 42 ) .
auditory startle and prepulse inhibition of startle were tested at 12 weeks of age ( figure 2 ) .
there were no differences in auditory startle amplitude ( p = . 27 ) between wild - type and gclm - / - mice .
when the 120 db auditory stimulus was preceded by a 70 db prepulse , the startle amplitude was significantly reduced ( p < . 05 ) in both wild - type and gclm - / - mice ( figure 2 ) .
there were no differences between wild - type and gclm - / - mice in the magnitude of this prepulse inhibition of startle ( p = . 28 ) .
latencies to maximum startle were also similar in wild - type and gclm - / - mice for both auditory startle ( 22.6 +/ - 1.8 msec and 20.8 +/ - 1.5 msec , resp. ; p = . 46 ) and prepulse inhibition of startle ( 31.9 +/ - 4.2 msec and 25.9 +/ - 1.8 msec , resp. ; p = . 18 ) .
locomotor activity and behavior in an open field were tested at 20 weeks of age , by placing the mice in a small arena and recording movements and behaviors for 15 min ( figure 3 ) .
gclm - / - and wild - type mice were nearly identical in all measures ( p > . 18 ) , including locomotor activity , total movement time , ambulatory distance traveled , time spent in different areas of the arena , number of stereotypic movements , and number of entries into the vertical plane ( figure 3 ) .
learning and memory were tested using a platform - reversal variant of the morris water maze , beginning at 14 weeks of age .
gclm - / - mice acquired the task equally as well as wild - type mice ; latency to find the hidden submerged platform decreased ( p < . 001 ) over the seven daily testing sessions for both mouse genotypes ( figure 4 ) .
platform reversal began on the eighth day , when the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant .
both wild - type and gclm - / - mice had difficulty finding the new platform location on the first day , reflected in their increased latencies to find the platform in session eight but were able to learn the new platform location over subsequent training sessions ( figure 4 ; p < . 0001 ) .
there were no significant differences between wild - type and gclm - / - mice in either acquisition or reversal of the task ( p > . 24 ) .
while wild - type mice showed a tendency toward increased platform latency on session ten , when compared to gclm - / - mice , this difference was not statistically significant ( p = . 24 ) .
one month after the end of the platform - reversal testing , retention was tested once for each mouse , using a probe test .
mice were placed in the morris water maze and were allowed to search for two minutes in the absence of a platform .
there were no differences between genotypes ( p > . 11 ) in percent dwell time in the platform quadrant ( wild - type : 23.9 +/ - 1.9 % ; gclm - / - : 19.7 +/ - 1.8 %) , percent dwell time in the reversal quadrant ( wild - type : 27.8 +/ - 1.5 % ; gclm - / - : 34.0 +/ - 3.4 %) , or in the average distance from target ( wild - type : 38.7 +/ - 1.6 cm ; gclm - / - : 35.7 +/ - 1.6 cm ) .
swim speed was also the same in wild - type ( 19.2 +/ - 0.4 cm / sec ) and gclm - / - ( 18.5 +/ - 0.4 cm / sec ) mice .
4. discussion genetic deletion of gclm leads to low gsh levels in all tissues including the brain [ 6 , 9 - 11 ] .
neurons and astrocytes from gclm - / - mice have been shown to be particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of various chemicals , such as domoic acid , polychlorinated biphenyls , methylmercury , certain organophosphorus insecticides , and polybrominated flame retardants , known to elicit oxidative stress [ 6 , 10 , 12 , 13 ] , and preliminary in vivo experiments with the flame retardant bde - 47 ( 2,2 ' , 4,4 ' - tetrabromodiphenyl ether ) have supported these findings ( giordano and costa , unpublished ) .
in order to carry out in vivo exposure studies with such compounds , to ascertain their potential ability to disrupt normal behavior , a behavioral characterization of gclm - / - mice was first needed .
results of the present study indicate that gclm - / - mice did not differ from wild - type mice in a number of behaviors aimed at testing spontaneous motor activity , motor coordination , learning and memory , and sensory functions .
these tests are normally used in behavioral toxicology to assess adverse effects of chemicals on the nervous system upon adult or developmental exposure to chemicals [ 29 ] .
the lack of differences between gclm - / - and wild - type mice in these tests would suggest that gsh deficiency does not lead to alterations in nervous system function significant enough to be detected .
however , significant differences would be expected upon challenges with exogenous compounds , particularly those which elicit oxidative stress .
as such , gclm - / - mice would represent a good model to assess the importance of such gene - environment interactions leading to neurotoxicity .
two additional explanations for the lack of differences observed between gclm - / - mice and wild - type mice in the present study may lie in the types of behavioral tests utilized and in the age of the animals .
whilst this work was in progress , another study investigating behavioral alterations in gclm - / - mice was published [ 11 ] .
these investigators not only confirmed some of our findings , but also evidenced additional subtle alterations .
as in our study , no differences were found in spatial working memory , spatial reference and learning memory , and spatial reversal learning .
however , in other tests , gclm - / - mice ( 4 - 6 month - old ) displayed increased novelty - induced exploration , altered behavior during an object recognition task , reduced behavioral inhibition under stress , and lower response to delayed fear conditioning [ 11 ] .
these subtle behavioral alterations were attributed to oxidative changes in the ventral hippocampus , with no changes in the dorsal hippocampus , and were suggested to be potentially relevant in schizophrenia [ 11 ] .
however , while an association between gclm polymorphisms and schizophrenia had been previously suggested [ 16 ] , more recent studies have challenged this hypothesis [ 17 , 18 ] .
in addition , it is possible that there are subtle differences between these two gclm - / - models , since the strategy for gene deletion was slightly different .
in the model first published by dalton et al .
[ 5 ] and used by steullet et al .
[ 11 ] , the first exon of the gclm gene was replaced with a neomycin phosphotransferase ( neo ) in reverse orientation .
in the model we have used here , the first exon was replaced with a beta - galactosidase / neomycin phosphotransferase ( beta - geo ) fusion gene in the forward orientation .
while these two gclm - / - models appear to have essentially identical changes in gsh levels , it is still possible that the two different approaches used to construct these models might have resulted in other unforeseen differences in their biology .
mice tested in this study were young adults , between 13 and 20 weeks of age .
it has been proposed that oxidative stress may contribute to aging by progressively increasing oxidant damage to cells [ 30 , 31 ] .
in addition , oxidative stress has been suggested to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases , such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 19 , 20 , 32 ] .
it has been recently shown that fibroblasts from gclm - / - mice undergo premature senescence , as evidenced by altered cell morphology , diminished growth rate , and increased senescence - associated beta - galactosidase activity [ 33 ] .
thus , it is plausible that gclm - / - would display altered behaviors , compared to their wild - type counterparts , as they age and thus become a useful model for studies on the effects of altered antioxidant capacity on the aging of the nervous system .

a working group consensus statement ( moon 2013 ) has recommended amongst other : 1 ) use of native t1 myocardium and ecv only , avoiding partition coefficient ( lambda ) 2 ) use of gadolinium - based contrast agents ( gbca ) for ecv calculation routinely and post - gad t1 maps taken at least 15 minutes following administration 3 ) use of at least 2 different slice orientations to add diagnostic confidence we sought to investigate the reproducibility of an 11 - cycle 5 ( 3 ) 3 molli sequence ( siemens prototype wip448b ) and furthermore wished to investigate whether repeating the molli acquisition on one slice orientation twice could increase precision .
methods 15 healthy volunteers ( 31 +/ - 5 years , 8 males ) with no known medical conditions , on no medication , underwent cmr scans ( avanto , siemens , 1.5t ) on two separate attendances with an 11 heart beat molli 5 ( 3 ) 3 .
following frequency adjustment , native t1 maps were obtained twice on a basal and a mid - ventricular slice respectively .
15 mins following gbca administration ( 0.1 mmol / kg , gadobutrol , bayer , germany ) both image planes were acquired again twice .
pixel - wise t1 maps were analyzed offline by 2 independent blinded operators .
a region of interest was manually drawn in the septum for myocardium and blood in native and post gad images as shown in fig 1 .
figure 1 shows native t1 maps ( top series numbers 1 - 4 ) and post gad ( bottom series numbers 5 - 8 ) .
one basal and one mid level were selected and the acquisition repeated twice both before and after the administration of gad .
regions of interest ( roi ) were drawn in the myocardium and blood .
the scan was repeated using the same protocol within 60 days .
to mimic routine clinical practice , the staff undertaking the second scan were not aware of the slice position used for acquisition during the first scan .
there were no significant differences in heart rate between the two scans.to mimic routine clinical practice , the staff undertaking the second scan were not aware of the slice position used for acquisition during the first scan .
there were no significant differences in heart rate between the two scans .
results intrastudy and interstudy intraclass coefficient ( icc ) was assessed for various models ( model a - f ) combining an increasing number of basal and mid level acquisitions as shown in table 1 .
intrastudy icc was excellent for native t1 myocardium and ecv ( 0.94 and 0.86 ) , but not for lambda ( 0.54 ) .
interstudy icc for native t1 was very good for all the models [ highest model e ( 0.90 ) , lowest model b ( 0.77 )] .
interstudy icc for lambda was overall poor [ highest model f ( 0.79 ) , lowest model b ( 0.70 )] .
for ecv there was excellent interstudy icc when at least 2 native and 2 post - gad slices were included , best model f ( 0.93 ; with 1 basal and 1 mid level acquisition repeated , total 4 acquisitions native and 4 post gad ) .
interobserver reproducibility was excellent with intra and inter scan reproducibility across all models for t1 , lambda and ecv > 0.90 ( highest model f ecv icc 1.00 , lowest model e lambda icc 0.94 ) .
table 1 showing the 6 models and their corresponding iccs .
the average icc of the two observers was used .
native t1 and ecv have excellent reproducibility , particularly when model f is used where one mid level and one basal level are selected , and the acquisitions repeated twice both before and after gad , allowing for the generation of 4 native ( 2 basal and 2 mid ) and 4 post gad maps .
given the increased reproducibility , at the only expense of two extra short breathholds , repeating each slice twice could be routinely considered in all scans where t1 maps are undertaken .

ecv shows the best reproducibility especially when images of one basal and one mid level are repeated twice ( model f ) and that t1 native myocardium reproducibility is excellent independently of model used .
we would therefore recommend that if only 2 levels are acquired with the molli sequence a repeat acquisition should be considered at each slice , to increase precision and reproducibility .

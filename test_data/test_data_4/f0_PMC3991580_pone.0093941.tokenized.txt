human keratinocytes are able to express various antimicrobial peptides ( amp ) to protect the skin from exaggerated microbial colonization and infection .
recently , in vitro growth - inhibiting activity of the skin - derived amp psoriasin , rnase 7 and human beta - defensin ( hbd ) - 2 against dermatophytes such as trichophyton ( t. ) rubrum have been reported .
to evaluate whether keratinocytes are able to respond to t. rubrum infection by an induced expression of amp we exposed primary keratinocytes to living conidia of t. rubrum .
this led to conidia germination and mycelial growth which was paralleled by a strong gene induction of the skin - derived amp rnase 7 and hbd - 3 .
gene expression of the amp psoriasin ( s100a7 ) and hbd - 2 were only slightly induced .
the t. rubrum - mediated rnase 7 gene induction was accompanied by increased secretion of rnase 7 .
parallel treatment of the keratinocytes with t. rubrum and the cytokine combination il - 17a / ifn - gamma resulted in synergistic induction of rnase 7 and hbd - 3 expression .
since patients receiving therapy by inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) more often suffer from dermatophytoses we investigated whether egfr may be involved in the t. rubrum - mediated rnase 7 and hbd - 3 induction .
primary keratinocytes incubated with an egfr blocking antibody as well as with the egfr antagonist ag1478 showed a significantly diminished rnase 7 and hbd - 3 induction upon exposure of the keratinocytes to t. rubrum indicating that egfr is involved in the t. rubrum - mediated induction of rnase 7 and hbd - 3 .
the growth of t. rubrum in vitro was inhibited by hbd - 3 in a dose - dependent manner suggesting that hbd - 3 may contribute to cutaneous innate defense against t. rubrum .
taken together our data indicate that keratinocytes are able to initiate a fast defense response towards t. rubrum by the increased expression of amp active against t. rubrum .
a dysregulation of amp may contribute to chronic and recurring dermatophytoses .

introduction skin infections with dermatophytes belong to the most common infections worldwide [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
the resulting clinical manifestation of a skin infection with dermatophytes is called tinea .
typical causes of tinea are dermatophytes of the genera trichophyton , microsporum and epidermophyton [ 1 ] .
the pathogenesis of tinea is not completely understood .
a characteristic of dermatophytes is their ability to adhere to the skin surface and to release a panel of enzymes which degrade host lipids and proteins .
especially the capability of dermatophytes to degrade keratin and to use it as a nutrient provides dermatophytes with an advantage to colonize the uppermost skin layers [ 3 ] .
to establish an infection dermatophytes have to cope with the cutaneous innate defense system .
antimicrobial peptides ( amp ) are important effector molecules of the innate skin defense due to their broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity allowing them to rapidly kill microorganisms [ 4 ] .
although the role of amp to control the growth of bacteria on the skin surface and to protect the skin from infection is widely recognized , the role of amp in tinea is less explored .
recently , it has been reported that amp are induced in the lesional epidermis of tinea patients [ 5 ] and that the skin - derived amp psoriasin , hbd - 2 and rnase 7 are able to inhibit the growth of dermatophytes in vitro [ 6 ] .
thus , there is increasing evidence that amp may also play an important role in the innate cutaneous defense against dermatophytes .
to gain further insight into the role of amp in cutaneous innate defense against dermatophytes we analyzed whether keratinocytes challenged with the dermatophyte trichophyton ( t. ) rubrum , the main cause of persisting dermatophytosis in humans [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , respond through an induced expression of amp .
our study revealed that primary keratinocytes exposed to t. rubrum showed a significant induction of the skin - derived amp rnase 7 and hbd - 3 mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) .
in addition we report on the ability of hbd - 3 to restrict the growth of t. rubrum in vitro .
together , these data strengthen the hypothesis that amp may play a major role in cutaneous innate defense against infection with dermatophytes .
materials and methods culture and stimulation of primary keratinocytes foreskin - derived primary keratinocytes pooled from different individuals were purchased from promocell ( heidelberg , germany ) and cultured in epilife medium ( life technologies , carlsbad , usa ) at 37degreesc in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % co2 .
for stimulation experiments with conidia and cytokines , keratinocytes were seeded in 12 - well tissue culture plates ( 3.8 cm2 / well , bd biosciences ) and used at 100 % confluence .
cytokines used for stimulation were from peprotech ( rocky hill , nj ) .
the egfr - blocking antibody cetuximab was obtained from merck ( darmstadt , germany ) and ag1478 was purchased from enzo life sciences ( farmingdale , ny ) .
typical strains of t. rubrum isolates were obtained from the department of dermatology , university hospital of schleswig - holstein in kiel , germany isolated from tinea lesions of patients who have given written consent which was approved by the institutional review board of the university of kiel .
patient data were anonymized and de - identified prior to analysis .
the strains were identified by established morphologic and physiologic criteria [ 9 ] .
microconidia were prepared as recently described [ 6 ] .
rna isolation and cdna synthesis after treatment , cells were washed with pbs and cells from one well of a 12 - well plate were harvested and lysed using 500 microl crystal rnamagic reagent and total rna was isolated according to the supplier 's protocol ( biolab - products , bebensee , germany ) .
rna quantity and quality was determined photometrically using a nanodrop device ( peqlab , erlangen , germany ) and 1 microg of total rna was reversely transcribed to cdna using oligo dt - primers and 50 units maxima reverse transcriptase ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
real - time pcr real - time pcr analyses were performed in a fluorescence temperature cycler ( stepone plus , life technologies ) as previously described [ 10 ] .
the following intron spanning primers were used : rnase 7 5 ' - gga gtc aca gca cga aga cca - 3 ' ( forward primer ) and 5 ' - cat ggc tga gtt gca tgc ttg a - 3 ' ( reverse primer ) ; hbd - 2 5 ' - gcc tct tcc agg tgt ttt tg - 3 ' ( forward primer ) and 5 ' - gag acc aca ggt gcc aat tt - 3 ' ( reverse primer ) ; hbd - 3 5 ' - agc cta gca gct atg agg atc - 3 ' ( forward primer ) and 5 ' - ctt cgg cag cat ttt cgg cca - 3 ' ( reverse primer ) ; psoriasin 5 ' - aga cgt gat gac aag att gag - 3 ' ( forward primer ) and 5 ' - tgt cct ttt tct caa aga cat c - 3 ' ( reverse primer ) .
standard curves were obtained for each primer set with serial dilutions of plasmids containing the amplification product .
all quantifications were normalized to the housekeeping gene rpl38 ( ribosomal protein l38 ) using the primer pair : 5 ' - tca agg act tcc tgc tca ca - 3 ' ( forward primer ) and 5 ' - aaa ggt atc tgc tgc atc gaa - 3 ' ( reverse primer ) .
relative expression is given as a ratio between target gene expression and rpl38 expression .
elisa secreted protein levels of rnase 7 were measured by elisa as described [ 11 ] .
the detection limit of the elisa is 0.3 ng / ml. the secretion of hbd - 3 using a hbd - 3 elisa was not detectable .
this was most likely due to unspecific binding of the highly cationic hbd - 3 to the surface of the 12 - well plates because in control experiments we did not detect any hbd - 3 ( detection limit 0.4 ng / ml ) using hbd - 3 concentrations up to 100 ng / ml incubated for 24 h in the 12 - well plates ( without any cells ) .
growth inhibition assay culture of t. rubrum , isolation of conidia and analyses of growth inhibition of t. rubrum were performed as recently described [ 6 ] with minor variations .
germinating conidia were generated by incubation of conidia for 6 h at 37degreesc in sabouraud 's glucose broth ( sab b - d , biomerieux , lyon , france ) .
germinating conidia were then washed and resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 7.2 ) .
45 microl conidia suspension ( 111 conidia / microl ) were incubated for 3 h at 34degreesc in a 96 - well plate with 5 microl of 0.01 % acetic acid containing different concentrations of hbd - 3 .
after incubation , 150 microl sabouraud 's glucose broth containing 100 units / ml penicillin and 100 microg / ml streptomycin were added to each well and growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 620 nm [ 6 ] .
each hbd - 3 concentration was tested in triplicate .
recombinant hbd - 3 was expressed in e. coli and purified as described [ 12 ] and stored in 0.01 % acetic acid .
results stimulation of primary keratinocytes with t. rubrum induces the expression of rnase 7 and hbd - 3 to assess the capability of t. rubrum to induce the expression of amp in keratinocytes we stimulated keratinocytes with 1x106 / ml and 1x107 / ml conidia of t. rubrum for 24 h. incubation consistently triggered conidial germination and mycelia outgrowth as revealed by microscopic inspection .
stimulation resulted in a strong gene induction of rnase 7 and hbd - 3 ( fig. 1a,b ) .
in contrast , gene expression of hbd - 2 and psoriasin was only weakly induced ( fig. 1c,d ) .
gene induction of rnase 7 correlated with increased rnase 7 protein secretion ( fig. 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0093941.g001 figure 1 trichophyton rubrum induces the expression of amp in human keratinocytes .
primary keratinocytes were exposed to 1x106 / ml and 1x107 / ml conidia of t. rubrum for 24 h. subsequently , gene expression of rnase 7 ( a ) , hbd - 3 ( b ) , hbd - 2 ( c ) and psoriasin ( d ) was analyzed by real - time pcr .

10.1371 / journal.pone.0093941.g002 figure 2 infection of keratinocytes with trichophyton rubrum leads to increased rnase 7 secretion .
primary keratinocytes were exposed to 1x106 / ml and 1x107 / ml conidia of t. rubrum for 24 h. secretion of rnase 7 was determined by analysis of the presence of rnase 7 in the cell supernatants using elisa .
data are means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , student 's t test ). t. rubrum together with il - 17a / ifn - gamma synergistically induces the expression of rnase 7 and hbd - 3 it has been shown that the cytokine combination il - 17a / ifn - gamma is a very potent inducer of amp such as rnase 7 and hbd - 3 expression in keratinocytes [ 13 ] .
to analyze whether stimulation of keratinocytes with t. rubrum may influence the il - 17a / ifn - gamma - induced rnase 7 and hbd - 3 expression , keratinocytes were exposed to t. rubrum in the presence of il - 17a / ifn - gamma .
gene expression of rnase 7 and hbd - 3 was synergistically induced by t. rubrum and il - 17a / ifn - gamma ( fig. 3a,c ) .
accordingly , secretion of rnase 7 was also synergistically induced ( fig. 3b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0093941.g003 figure 3 trichophyton rubrum together with the cytokine combination ifn - gamma / il - 17 synergistically induce rnase 7 and hbd - 3 expression in keratinocytes .
( a ) primary keratinocytes were incubated with 1x107 / ml conidia of t. rubrum together with ifn - gamma / il - 17a ( each 20 ng / ml ) for 24 h. gene expression of rnase 7 ( a ) and hbd - 3 ( c ) was analyzed by real - time pcr .
release of rnase 7 was determined by elisa ( b ) .
data are means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , student 's t test ) .
epidermal growth factor receptor mediates the t. rubrum - induced expression of rnase 7 it has been shown that therapeutic inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) is often associated with an increased occurrence of skin infections including infections with dermatophytes [ 14 ] .
to investigate whether egfr may play a role in the observed t. rubrum - induced rnase 7 and hbd - 3 expression we used an egfr - blocking antibody ( cetuximab ) .
inhibition of the egfr by this antibody led to a significant attenuation of rnase 7 and hbd - 3 gene induction in primary keratinocytes upon stimulation with t. rubrum ( fig. 4a,c ) .
accordingly , analysis of rnase 7 secretion using elisa revealed a significant decrease of t. rubrum - mediated rnase 7 secretion ( fig. 4b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0093941.g004 figure 4 an antibody towards the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) inhibited the trichophyton rubrum - induced rnase 7 and hbd - 3 expression in keratinocytes .
primary keratinocytes were pre - incubated with the egfr - antibody cetuximab ( 20 microg / ml ) followed by treatment for 24 h with 1x107 / ml conidia of t. rubrum in the presence of cetuximab ( 20 microg / ml ) .
gene expression of rnase 7 ( a ) and hbd - 3 ( c ) was analyzed by real - time pcr .
release of rnase 7 was determined by elisa ( b ) .
data are means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , student 's t test ) .
to further evaluate the influence of egfr we used the egfr antagonist ag1478 , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective to egfr .
in concordance with the cetuximab - experiments the use of ag1478 strongly inhibited the rnase 7 gene and protein induction in primary keratinocytes following treatment with t. rubrum ( fig. 5a,b ) .
similarly , t. rubrum - mediated hbd - 3 gene induction was also inhibited by ag1478 ( fig. 5c ) 10.1371 / journal.pone.0093941.g005 figure 5 the egfr antagonist ag1478 attenuates the induction of rnase 7 and hbd - 3 in trichophyton rubrum - infected keratinocytes .
primary keratinocytes were pre - treated with ag1478 ( 10 microm in 0.1 % dmso ) followed by stimulation with 1x107 / ml conidia of t. rubrum with ag1478 ( 10 microm in 0.1 % dmso ) for 24 h. incubation with 0.1 % dmso served as a control .
gene expression of rnase 7 ( a ) and hbd - 3 ( c ) was analyzed by real - time pcr .
release of rnase 7 was determined by elisa ( b ) .
data are means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , student 's t test ) .
hbd - 3 restricts the growth of t. rubrum since we observed a strong gene expression of hbd - 3 in t. rubrum - stimulated keratinocytes and because a potential activity of hbd - 3 against t. rubrum or other dermatophytes has not yet been elucidated we questioned whether hbd - 3 may influence the growth of t. rubrum .
therefore germinated conidia of t. rubrum were incubated for 3 h with hbd - 3 followed by incubation in sabouraud 's glucose broth .
the growth of t. rubrum over time was assessed by densitometrical analysis as recently reported [ 6 ] .
the results of this experiment revealed that hbd - 3 dose - dependently inhibited the growth of t. rubrum ( fig. 6a - d ) .
concentrations of 50 microg / ml to 12.5 microg / ml hbd - 3 significantly inhibited the growth of t. rubrum monitored after 36 h ( fig. 6 a - c ) .
thus , hbd - 3 efficiently restricted the growth of t. rubrum .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0093941.g006 figure 6 hbd - 3 restricts the growth of trichophyton rubrum .
45 microl of germinating conidia of t. rubrum were incubated in a 96 - well plate for 3 h at 34degreesc in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 7.2 ) together with 5 microl of hbd - 3 ( solved in 0.01 % acetic acid ) to reach an end concentration of 50 microg / ml hbd - 3 ( a ) , 25 microg / ml hbd - 3 ( b ) , 12.5 microg / ml hbd - 3 ( c ) and 6.25 microg / ml hbd - 3 ( d ) .
incubation without hbd - 3 ( only 5 microl 0.01 % acetic acid ) served as a growth control and treatment with the antifungal drug fluconazole ( 100 microg / ml end concentration ) served as a positive control .
after 3 h incubation 150 microl sabouraud 's glucose broth containing 100 units / ml penicillin and 100 microg / ml streptomycin was added to each well and growth was monitored over time by measuring the optical density at 620 nm. data are means +/ - sd of one representative experiment of two , each performed in triplicate samples (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 compared to growth control , student 's t test ) .
discussion keratinocytes are the first cells dermatophytes have to cope with when they start to colonize and infect skin .
a main defense reaction of keratinocytes against invading microorganisms is the induced expression of antimicrobial peptides ( amp ) [ 4 ] .
amp represent an evolutionary well conserved host defense strategy to rapidly and efficiently control the growth of microbes due their broad spectrum antimicrobial activity [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
in this study we show that primary keratinocytes exposed to the most common dermatophyte t. rubrum [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] strongly boost the expression of the amp rnase 7 and human beta - defensin ( hbd ) - 3 .
these data are in concordance with a recent study reporting an increase of immunoreactivity against the amp hbd - 2 , - 3 , rnase 7 and psoriasin in the lesional epidermis of patients suffering from tinea [ 5 ] .
the t. rubrum - induced rnase 7 and hbd - 3 expression was synergistically increased in the presence of the cytokines ifn - gamma and il - 17a , a cytokine combination recently shown to be highly efficient in inducing amp in keratinocytes [ 13 ] .
these data indicate that keratinocytes are able to sense dermatophytes leading to the induction of amp .
the identity of the responsible pattern recognition receptor ( s ) remains to be shown .
toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) such as tlr - 2 may be possible candidates .
tlr - 2 has been implicated in the recognition of the yeast candida albicans [ 17 ] - [ 19 ] and the expression of tlr - 2 and tlr - 4 is upregulated in tinea [ 5 ] .
other potential candidate receptors could be the c - type lectin - like receptors dectin - 1 and dectin - 2 which both have been implicated into the recognition of fungi [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] including trichopyton rubrum [ 22 ] .
dectin - 1 mutations were described that reduce recognition of fungal beta - glucan and thereby facilitate mycotic infections including onychomycosis caused by t. rubrum [ 23 ] .
recently , in vitro experiments demonstrated that the skin - derived amp psoriasin , hbd - 2 and rnase 7 were able to restrict the growth of t. rubrum [ 6 ] .
in the present study we identified hbd - 3 as an additional potent amp to inhibit the growth of t. rubrum .
the activities of hbd - 3 and rnase 7 against t. rubrum and their induced expression in t. rubrum - treated keratinocytes as well as their upregulation in lesional skin of tinea patients suggest that amp such as rnase 7 and hbd - 3 may play a crucial role in the initial defense reaction of keratinocytes against invading dermatophytes .
deficiencies in the amp - based cutaneous innate defense against dermatophytes may increase the susceptibility to develop tinea , a hypothesis which needs to be proven in further studies .
it has been reported that patients receiving therapy by inhibition of the egfr often suffered from cutaneous infections including dermatophytoses [ 14 ] .
therefore we wondered whether an inhibition of the egfr may negatively affect amp induction in keratinocytes infected with dermatophytes .
indeed , blocking the egfr resulted in a significantly decreased hbd - 3 and rnase 7 expression in keratinocytes exposed to t. rubrum .
these results make it likely that an attenuation of amp expression through the anti - egfr therapy may contribute to the observed increased dermatophytes infection rate in these patients , a hypothesis which needs to be proven in further studies .
future studies have to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and involved signal transduction pathways leading to activation of the egfr by t. rubrum .
our results are in concordance with recent data reporting that keratinocytes treated with the egfr - inhibitor erlotinib showed a decreased expression of amp and a reduced antimicrobial activity of conditioned medium of primary human keratinocytes against staphylococcus aureus [ 24 ] .
in summary , our data indicate that an exposure of keratinocytes to t. rubrum leads to the induced expression of the amp rnase 7 and hbd - 3 in an egfr - dependent manner .
increased level of amp may help the host to control the growth and spread of t. rubrum and probably of other dermatophytes as well .
a failure to adequately induce amp to fight off dermatophytes may be responsible for the development of dermatophytosis as seen in patients with anti - egfr treatment .
future studies have to evaluate whether a correlation between dysregulation of amp expression and susceptibility to dermatophytes exists .

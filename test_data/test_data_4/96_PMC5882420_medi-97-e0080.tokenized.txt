http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract rationale : primary central nervous system lymphoma ( pcnsl ) with initial manifestations of constipation and intestinal obstruction ( io ) is rare .
patient concerns : a 50 - year - old chinese male patient was admitted to the gastroenterology department due to constipation and abdominal distention for 8 days .
he had experienced intermittent back pain for 3 years prior to admission .
based on abdominal radiography , he was initially diagnosed with io and treated with meal restriction and enemas .
however , his symptoms worsened , and progressive lower limb weakness was observed .
diagnoses : a colonoscopy was inconclusive due to the io. computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed space - occupying lesions near centrums 9 - 11 of the thoracic vertebrae .
the patient underwent spinal decompression surgery , and pathologic examination led to a diagnosis of pcnsl ( diffuse large b cell lymphoma ) .
outcomes : the symptoms of the io improved postoperatively , and the patient partially recovered his lower limb muscle strength .
he returned to his homeland for chemotherapy .
lessons : io can be an initial , unspecific symptom of spinal cord compression in patients with pcnsl .
keywords intestinal obstruction lymphoma non - hodgkin spinal cord neoplasms open - accesstrue 1 introduction intestinal obstruction ( io ) is a common acute digestive disorder .
common causes include mechanical ( tumors , volvulus , or surgical complications ) , dynamic ( paralysis or cramps ) , and ischemic factors .
primary central nervous system lymphoma ( pcnsl ) is an extremely rare form of malignant lymphoma that only occurs in < 3 % of central nervous system ( cns ) tumors. [ 1 ] the coexistence of these conditions is rare .
herein , we report a case of a male patient who initially demonstrated manifestations of io with a final diagnosis of pcnsl .
2 case report a 50 - year - old male chinese patient was admitted due to a lack of defecation for 8 days and with symptoms of abdominal distention .
his medical history included a trauma - induced fracture of the 3rd transverse process of the lumbar vertebrae 3 years earlier , after which he intermittently suffered from backache .
he received physical therapy ( cupping ) 3 days prior to admission , which effectively alleviated the pain .
his older brother had died from lung cancer .
the patient seemed well - nourished .
a physical examination was normal ; notably , although he reported feeling cold in his lower limbs , the pulse of the dorsalis pedis arteries and sensation in both legs were normal .
no enlarged superficial lymph nodes were seen .
percussion revealed a bilateral dullness in the center of his abdomen as well as tympany .
abdominal radiography indicated interspersed gas within the intestinal canal , air - fluid levels ( in the right center of the abdomen ) , and massive intestinal gas accumulation in the dilated intestinal canal ( fig. 1 ) .
laboratory data revealed a slightly elevated concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen , 3.86 ng / ml ( reference range , < 3.4 ng / ml ) .
routine blood / urine / stool tests , electrolytes , liver / renal function examinations , human immunodeficiency virus test by elisa , an upper abdominal ultrasound , and a chest radiography did not show any remarkable findings .
figure 1 abdominal radiography revealed air - fluid levels ( red arrows ) and massive gas accumulation in the dilated intestinal canal ( yellow arrow ) .
based on these test results , incomplete io was considered .
after admission , the patient continued suffering from abdominal distension as well as a lack of autonomous defecation and flatus although he received conventional therapy , including meal restriction and enemas .
three days after admission , progressive lower limb weakness was observed ; the results of the straight leg raise of the left and right legs were 45degrees (+) and 60degrees (+) , respectively , and that of the reinforced straight leg raise of both legs was (+) , with reduction of lower limb muscle strength ( left leg : grade ii ; right leg : grade iii ) and decreased muscle tension .
an axial abdominal computed tomography ( ct ) scan showed suspicious eccentric thickening of the colon walls ( fig. 2 ) , but no enlarged lymph nodes were seen .
no remarkable lesion was found in a subsequent colonoscopy ; however , the preoperative preparation was unsatisfactory due to the io ( fig. 3 ) .
therefore , the ct images were reevaluated with an expanded scope ; they revealed a space - occupying lesion to the right of centrums 9 - 11 of the thoracic vertebrae ( fig. 4 ) .
magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine scan indicated an abnormal signal in centrum 10 of the thoracic vertebrae and space - occupying lesions near centrums 9 - 11 as well as in the spinal canal ( figs. 5 - 7 ) .
accordingly , it was assumed that the io was caused by the space - occupying lesions in the centrums compressing the corresponding spinal cord sections .
figure 2 abdominal computed tomography after admission showed eccentric thickening of the colon walls ( red arrow ) .
figure 3 colonoscopy indicated no obvious space - occupying lesions .
an inadequate preparation due to the patient 's intestinal obstruction should be noted .
figure 4 computed tomography revealed a space - occupying lesion on the right side of centrums 9 - 11 of the thoracic vertebrae ( red arrow ) .
figure 5 magnetic resonance imaging ( coronal ) showed lesions near centrums 9 - 11 of the thoracic vertebrae ( red arrow ) .
figure 6 magnetic resonance imaging ( t2 - weighted ) revealed lesion near centrums 9 - 11 ( red arrow ) that invaded the vertebral body ( yellow arrow ) .
( a ) sagittal and ( b ) transversal images .
figure 7 magnetic resonance imaging ( t2 - weighted ) sagittal images revealed lesions that invaded the spinal canal ( red arrow ) .
the patient then underwent a resection of the lesions near the centrums .
a pathological examination revealed masses in the centrums and right pedicle of the vertebral arch of centrum 10 of the thoracic vertebrae as well as non - hodgkin lymphoma ( nhl ) of the diffuse large b cell lymphoma ( dlbcl ) type ( also , germinal - center type ) .
immunohistochemical analyses showed : ae1 / ae3 ( - ) , bcl - 2 ( - ) , bcl - 6 (+) , cd10 ( - ) , cd20 (+) , cd3 ( marginally +) , cd30 ( ki - 1 ) ( - ) , cd31 ( - ) , cd34 ( - ) , cd5 ( marginally +) , hmb45 ( - ) , ki - 67 ( index , 40 %) , mum - 1 ( - ) , and pax - 5 (+) ( fig. 8 ) .
the final diagnosis was pcnsl of the dlbcl type , in combination with an io caused by spinal compression .
after the surgery , the io symptoms were partially relieved , and the patient recovered some of the muscle strength in his lower limbs .
he returned to his homeland for chemotherapy and lost to follow - up. figure 8 ( a ) diffusely distributed atypical ( large ) lymphoid cells with abundant cytoplasm and visible nucleoli ( hematoxylin and eosin staining ) .
( b ) tumor cells showed strong positive staining for the cd20 b cell marker ( immunohistochemistry ) .
( c ) tumor cells were negative for cd10 ( immunohistochemistry ) .

3 discussion spinal tumors are 10 to 15 times less common than primary intracranial tumors and represent 2 % to 4 % of all primary tumors of the cns. [ 2 ] they are classified as primary versus secondary tumors , and categorized as intramedullary , intradural , extramedullary , or extradural .
the most common invasion sites of spinal tumors include the midthoracic ( 69 %) , lumbar ( 27 %) , and cervical spine ( 4 %).[ 3 ] pcnsl , defined as nhl that can invade not only the brain but also the leptomeninges , eyes , and spinal cord , is extremely rare. [ 4 ] spinal tumors can lead to spinal cord compression and result in a series of unspecific symptoms , such as io in this case .
pcnsl has specific imaging characteristics .
on ct scans , tumor lesions mainly appear as shadows of isodensity or slightly elevated density ; on magnetic resonance imaging , they show low or isosignal intensities on t1 - wi images and high signal intensities on rho - wi and t2 - wi images ; gadolinium - diethylenetriamine penta - acetic acid was reported to improve the quality of t1 - wi images by markedly enhancing the tumor. [ 5 ] molecular imaging by positron emission tomography with 18f - fluoro - 2 - deoxy - glucose is helpful for diagnosis , identification of the metabolically active tumor compartment , and prediction of the treatment response. [ 6 ] extranodal nhl accounts for 30 % to 40 % of all nhl cases in different regions. [ 7 ] spinal tumors are one of the rarest forms of nhl and are only observed in < 5 % of nhl cases. [ 8 ] leptomeningeal , epidural , and brain metastases are the most common neurologic complications of pcnsl , all of which are associated with a poor prognosis .
dlbcl is the most common type of nhl worldwide and the main type of pcnsl. [ 9 ] immunohistochemically , the large lymphoid cells were cd20 (+) and cd3 ( - ) .
spinal dlbcl can be categorized into the germinal center b cell [ cd10 (+) or cd10 ( - )/ bcl - 6 (+)/ mum1 ( - )] and nongerminal center b cell [ cd10 ( - )/ bcl - 6 ( - ) or cd10 ( - )/ bcl - 6 (+)/ mum1 ( - )] types .
it is known to initially involve the paraspinal soft tissues , such as the paravertebral ganglion or epidural lymphoid tissue , followed by invasion around the spinal cord via the vertebral foramen without destroying bony structures .
this is consistent with the findings in our case .
it has been reported that back pain [ 4,10 ] and signs of lower body motor neuron involvement [ 11 ] were the most common symptoms in patients with spinal cord compression .
in our case , the patient showed similar symptoms .
although the physical examination on admission was normal , he had complained of intermittent back pain for years , which had been assumed to be a sequelae of a past transverse process fracture ; however , the abnormal sensation in his lower limbs on admission was unexplained .
unfortunately , we missed the clues until the spinal cord compression syndrome was obvious .
in our case , the first symptom that was indicative of a spinal cord compression was the reduction of muscle strength in the lower limbs , which has been reported as a regular manifestation of spinal cord injuries. [ 12 ] due to the high mortality rate of surgery , it was debated whether surgical treatment should be performed. [ 13,14 ] the patient survived the surgical decompression , and future chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy is considered beneficial. [ 15 ] in our case , the cause of the io was revealed through surgery and pathological examination .
in summary , signs of spinal cord compression , including weakness of the lower limbs and unexplained back pain prior to admission , were observed but inadequate attention was given to these symptoms at the time .
spinal cord injury accompanied by sensory disturbance and dyskinesia of the lower limbs were useful to distinguish this case from other cases of io. innervation of the stomach , small intestine , colon , and rectum is mainly formed by the sympathetic nerves of the thoracic ( t ) 6 to lumbar ( l ) 3 spinal cord as well as the parasympathetic nerves of the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and sacral parasympathetic nucleus of the sacral ( s ) 2 to s4 spinal cord .
in this case , the spinal cord injury of the thoracic segments impaired both , sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves , and reduced gastrointestinal motility , leading to io. moreover , due to the loss of anorectal coordination resulting from forced defecation due to the spinal cord injury , the patient exhibited a lack of autonomous defecation , another reason for his constipation .
the findings of the current case can inspire gastroenterologists when seeking uncommon causes of io , which is a common disorder encountered in daily clinical practice .
a diagnosis of the functional disorder should be based on an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology .
pcnsl should be considered as an atypical cause of io .

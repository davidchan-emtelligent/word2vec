this study describes the design and construction of a subtype c founder virus consensus env immunogen derived from newly transmitted / founder virus sequences , and its immunogenicity testing in the presence or absence of liganded cd4 , in small animals .
methods monomeric ( gp120 ) , dimeric ( gp120gcn4 ) and trimeric ( gp140gcn4 +/ - ) founder virus conformations were expressed in mammalian cell culture .
unliganded or 2dcd4s60c liganded env glycoproteins were purified by lectin affinity chromatography , followed by conformation and complex purification using size exclusion chromatography .
immunogens / immune complexes were evaluated by elisa , sds - page , native page and surface plasmon resonance .
immunogenicity of each conformation alone or complexed to 2dcd4s60c was evaluated in rabbits .
breadth and potency of the rabbit sera was tested against 12 pseudoviruses ( tiers 1 - 3 ) , derived from hiv - 1 subtype b and c env , using the phenosense neutralizing antibody assay ( monogram bioscience inc. ) .
results minimal neutralizing breadth was obtained from animals immunized exclusively with env conformations .
however , animals that received the env / 2dcd4s60c complex showed extensive neutralizing capacity against all 12 viruses tested , including the tier 2 and 3 virus strains .
end - point elisa titre results revealed that the rabbits that were immunized with env / 2dcd4s60c produced both env and 2dcd4 specific titres , but those directed towards 2dcd4 were on average 10x lower than the 2dcd4 control group .
this implies a proportion of the neutralizing antibody activity is directed towards conserved epitopes exposed on the env / 2dcd4s60c immunogens .
conclusion the ability to induce bnab activity in previous immunization studies utilizing env / cd4 complexes was attributed to the induction of high anti - cd4 titres. by contrast , in our study the relatively low anti - cd4 titres compared to anti - env titres and neutralization profiles suggest an alternative mechanism of neutralization other than a response directed to cd4 alone .

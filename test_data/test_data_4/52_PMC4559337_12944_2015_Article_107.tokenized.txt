background lipoprotein lipase ( lpl ) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with a heterogeneous clinical presentation .
several mutations in the lpl gene have been identified to cause decreased activity of the enzyme .
findings an 11 - week - old , exclusively breastfed male presented with coffee - ground emesis , melena , xanthomas , lipemia retinalis and chylomicronemia .
genomic dna analysis identified lipoprotein lipase deficiency due to compound heterozygosity including a novel p.q240h mutation in exon 5 of the lipoprotein lipase ( lpl ) gene .
his severe hypertriglyceridemia , including xanthomas , resolved with dietary long - chain fat restriction .
conclusions we describe a novel mutation of the lpl gene causing severe hypertriglyceridemia and report the response to treatment .
a review of the current literature regarding lpl deficiency syndrome reveals a few potential new therapies under investigation .
keywords chylomicronemia triglyceride lipoprotein lipase deficiency issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 findings exogenous lipid metabolism involves packaging of dietary fat into chylomicrons in the small intestine , which are later transported to the bloodstream .
the initial step of endogenous lipid metabolism involves the hydrolysis of chylomicrons by lipoprotein lipase ( lpl ) [ 1 ] .
lpl deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000 in the united states and higher in other world regions , like quebec , canada due to a founder effect [ 2 ] .
the clinical presentation can include moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia in affected homozygotes or compound heterozygotes , while simple heterozygote carriers often have normal lipids [ 3 ] .
clinical features include eruptive xanthomas , abdominal pain , hepato - splenomegaly , lower gastrointestinal bleeding , recurrent pancreatitis , or lipemia retinalis [ 4 ] .
dietary fat restriction is the cornerstone of treatment , and gene therapy trials are ongoing [ 5 ] .
case report we report the case of an 11 - week - old male of puerto rican descent who presented to the emergency department with coffee - ground emesis , melena and a papular rash .
he was born full term to healthy , nonconsanguineous parents with a birth weight of 8 lb 4 oz and was exclusively breast - fed .
he had 4 - 5 episodes of coffee - ground emesis , one episode of melena and a papular rash ( fig. 1 ) that spread from his extremities to his trunk over the course of 3 weeks .
cbc revealed a hematocrit of 17 % and his blood was grossly lipemic .
a random lipid panel showed triglycerides ( tg ) of 43,980 mg / dl. fig. 1 eruptive xanthomas on the right sole the physical exam was notable for a well - appearing infant with diffuse 2 mm yellow papules consistent with eruptive xanthomas and lipemia retinalis on fundoscopic exam .
fasting lipid profile revealed total cholesterol 768 mg / dl , tg 37,695 mg / dl , and hdl < 10 mg / dl. breast - feeding was discontinued and he was placed on enfaport lipil , a formula with 84 % of fat content from medium - chain triglycerides ( mct ) and 16 % from long - chain fats .
a repeat lipid profile one month after the formula change revealed dramatic improvement in tg ( table 1 ) .
two months after treatment , xanthomas and lipemia retinalis resolved ; weight gain and linear growth were normal .
we hypothesized that this child had an autosomal recessive mutation in the lpl gene .

the parents gave their consent to publish this case .
genomic dna was isolated from whole blood using puregene dna isolation kit ( gentra systems , qiagen inc , mississauga , on , canada ) .
pcr amplifications were performed using primers covering the coding regions and ~ 100 bp of intron - exon boundaries of the lpl gene as described previously [ 3 ] .
bi - directional sanger sequencing was performed using established conditions [ 3 ] on an abi 3730 dna analyzer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
dna sequences were analyzed using seqscape v2.6 ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
results and discussion we found that the proband was a compound heterozygote for one novel and one reported mutation within exon 5 of the lpl gene ( fig. 2 ) .
the first mutation p.g215e was a heterozygous transition c.644g - - > a , resulting in a substitution of glycine to glutamic acid at amino acid 215 ( identical to residue 188 in the mature protein ) .
this mutation has been previously reported to cause lpl deficiency [ 6 ] .
the second , novel mutation p.q240h was a heterozygous transversion c.721g - - > t , causing an amino acid substitution of glutamine to histidine at residue 240 ( identical to residue 213 in the mature protein ) .
in silico software programs polyphen2 and sift both predicted that this mutation was probably damaging .
both parents' dna samples were sequenced : the lpl p.q240h mutation was found in the father and the p.g215e mutation was found in the mother. fig. 2 segregation of lpl mutations in index family .
pedigree structure and dna sequence electropherogram tracings of the lpl gene in the vicinity of codons 215 and 240 for each family member are shown .
three letter nucleotide sequences , single letter amino acid codes , and codon numbers corresponding to amino acid residues are indicated .
asterisks show heterozygosity at the specific amino acid position : the father is a simple heterozygote for the p.q240h mutation , the mother is a simple heterozygote for the p.g215e mutation and the proband is a compound heterozygote for both mutations lpl plays a role in multiple stages of lipid metabolism , including hydrolysis of chylomicrons .
lpl is primarily synthesized by myocytes and adipocytes and recent studies have identified glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored high - density lipoprotein - binding protein 1 ( gpihbp1 ) as the molecule responsible for transporting lpl to the capillary lumen [ 7 ] .
lpl deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by decreased lpl activity due to mutations in the lpl gene [ 2 ] .
the lpl gene is located on chromosome 8p21.3 and contains 10 exons , spanning ~ 30 kb and encodes a mature protein of 448 amino acids [ 8 ] .
most mutations are found in exons 4 , 5 and 6 and although missense mutations are more common , nonsense , frameshift , insertion , deletion and duplication mutations have also been described [ 9 ] .
the mutation in this patient expands the spectrum of known pathogenic lpl mutations to more than 150 .
it also occurs in a region of the protein that has to date been relatively bereft of reported mutations .
the involvement of amino acid residue 240 also highlights the functional importance of the local domain in lipolysis of triglyceride - rich lipoproteins .
to date , genotype - phenotype correlations have not been identified [ 2 , 10 ] .
patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygotes can present with marked hypertriglyceridemia .
heterozygote patients can have normal or mildly elevated tg levels [ 3 ] .
both parents of our patient are heterozygous carriers of lpl gene mutations and had normal lipids .
the clinical manifestations of lpl deficiency are heterogeneous .
eruptive xanthomas appear mostly on shoulders , buttocks and extensor surfaces of the limbs when the tg levels exceed 2000 mg / dl [ 11 ] .
lipemia retinalis involving the peripheral vessels can be seen with tg levels over 2,500 mg / dl and as the levels increase , the damage extends to the posterior pole [ 12 ] .
abdominal pain and gastrointestinal hemorrhage have been attributed to hyperviscosity secondary to elevated tg [ 13 ] .
pancreatitis is common in these patients and risk increases with tg levels over 1,000 mg / dl [ 14 ] .
therefore , the goal of therapy is to decrease tg levels < 1,000 mg / dl [ 15 ] .
dietary restriction remains the cornerstone of treatment and fat supplements using mct are useful since they are absorbed directly into the portal vein [ 15 ] .
long - term data on patients with lpl deficiency are limited but show normal linear growth and puberty despite dietary fat restriction [ 4 ] .
even with recurrent pancreatitis , this population does not demonstrate a high mortality rate [ 16 ] .
satisfactory tg levels can be difficult to achieve with diet restriction alone .
drug therapy using gemfibrozil , omega - 3 fatty acids and orlistat may decrease tg levels when combined with a fat - restricted diet however , the use of these drugs is controversial [ 3 , 17 , 18 ] .
therapy involving intramuscular introduction of a gain - of - function variant of the lpl gene is approved in europe , although is costly and has only a transient effect [ 5 ] .
a promising treatment approach currently under investigation is orally - administered diacylglycerol o - acyltransferase 1 ( dgat1 ) inhibitors targeting dgat1 , which mediates triglyceride synthesis during dietary fat absorption [ 19 ] .
our patient is a compound heterozygote who has a novel p.q240h mutation in exon 5 of the lpl gene causing severe hypertriglyceridemia .
although his tg levels are much improved with mct - based formula , the challenge will be maintaining those levels with dietary fat restriction as table foods are introduced and he grows through childhood .

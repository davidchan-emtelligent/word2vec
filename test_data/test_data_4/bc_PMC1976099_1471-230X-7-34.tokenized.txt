background portal vein thrombosis ( pvt ) is increasingly frequently being diagnosed , but systematic descriptions of the natural history and clinical handling of the condition are sparse .
the aim of this retrospective study was to describe risk factors , clinical presentation , complications and treatment of portal vein thrombosis in a single - centre .
methods sixty - seven patients were identified in the electronic records from 1992 to 2005 .
all data were obtained from the patient records .
results one or more risk factors ( e.g. prothrombotic disorder or abdominal inflammation ) were present in 87 % .
symptoms were abdominalia , splenomegaly , fever , ascites , haematemesis , and weight loss .
abdominalia and fever occurred more frequently in patients with acute pvt .
frequent complications were splenomegaly , oesophageal - and gastric varices with or without bleeding , portal hypertensive gastropathy and ascites .
varices and bleeding were more frequent in patients with chronic pvt .
patients who received anticoagulant therapy more frequently achieved partial / complete recanalization .
patients with varices who were treated endoscopically in combination with beta - blockade had regression of the varices .
the overall mortality was 13 % in one year , and was dependent on underlying causes .
conclusion most patients had a combination of local and systemic risk factors for pvt .
we observed that partial / complete recanalization was more frequent in patients treated with anticoagulation therapy , and that regression of varices was more pronounced in patients who where treated with active endoscopy combined with pharmacological treatment .
background over the last years , portal vein thrombosis ( pvt ) is increasingly frequently being diagnosed by wide use of ultrasound - doppler equipment .
recently , the lifetime risk of getting pvt in the general population is reported to be 1 % [ 1 ] .
the condition , thus , attracts more focus .
the conception of the severity of the problem among treating physicians varies between desolate and unimportant .
the recommended therapeutic approach varies between one of expectancy and active intervention aimed at supposed risk factors and complications .
accordingly , there is a need for a basis for clinical decisions .
risk factors and complications to pvt have become better defined although most of the information derives from patients with cirrhosis [ 2,3 ] .
still , the rational management of pvt is still not adequately understood , and there have been no controlled studies .
based on some case - series , anticoagulation may be associated with recanalization of both acute [ 4,5 ] and chronic thrombosis [ 6 ] .
band ligation remains central in treating acute variceal bleeding .
secondary prophylaxis of rebleeding with ligation is effective ; however , there are insufficient data on beta - blockade alone or in combination with endoscopy [ 7 - 9 ] .
pvt seems most often to develop in the presence of both systemic and local risk factors [ 10,11 ] , but the relative importance of these factors for the course and treatment strategy of the condition remains unclear .
thus , there are several unresolved issues regarding pvt that due to the rarity of the condition cannot be clarified by large trials .
therefore , the aim of this case - series was to describe risk factors , clinical presentation , complications , treatment and outcome in patients with pvt in a tertiary university hospital .
methods sixty - seven patients were identified in the computerised hospital administrative registration system by the icd10 classification code i81.9 .
all cases from january 1992 to december 2005 of extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis or intrahepatic portal vein thrombosis were included .
all registered diagnoses were based on either ultrasound with doppler , ct - angiography or mri .
diagnostic inclusion criteria were partial or complete thrombosis with the extension of the thrombus defined .
follow - up elapsed from the time of admission , and lasted to either death or december 31st 2005 .
the following data were extracted from the clinical records : sex , age , risk factors ( prothrombotic tendency , cirrhosis , cancer , abdominal inflammation , infection , surgical abdominal intervention , none ) , clinical presentation ; abdominalia (= abdominal pain , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting or diarrhoea ) , splenomegaly , fever , ascites ( tense / soft , diagnosed by clinical evaluation or ultrasound ) , haemorrhage (= haematemesis , melaena or rectal bleeding ) , presentation of pvt ( acute < 60 days or chronic > 60 days [ 4 ]) , complications ( oesophageal - and gastric varices , variceal haemorrhage , portal hypertensive gastropathy , ascites ) , extension of the thrombus ( intra - and / or extrahepatic , superior mesenteric vein or splenic vein ) , information on coagulation disorders , imaging methods ( doppler ultrasound , ct angiography , mri , and endoscopy ) , treatment ( anticoagulation , thrombolysis , sclerotherapy , banding , beta - blockade , long - acting nitrates and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting ( tips )) , the course of varices , recanalization and finally the cause of death .
diagnosis of portal hypertensive gastropathy and grading of oesophageal - and gastric varices was made by means of endoscopy .
thrombophilia investigation was performed by using citrated plasma and heparin - flouride containing plasma collected by venipuncture and kept at - 80degreesc until analysis .
the protocol for sample collection and processing , as well as data interpretation , has been reported in previous publications [ 12 - 14 ] .
thrombophilia testing included collection for antithrombin ( at ) , homocystein , protein c , free protein s , factor v ( fv ) leiden , prothrombin g20210a , von willebrand - factor , activated protein c resistance , beta - 2 glycoprotein - 1 ( apa ) , phospholipid antibody , and lupus anticoagulant ( la ) .
the spontaneous fibrinolytic capacity was determined by a routine fibrin plate technique .
due to the severity of cancer and cirrhosis , we stratified the patients in two groups : 1 .
patients without cancer or cirrhosis and 2 .
patients with cancer or cirrhosis .
data from the two groups were analysed separately .
results for the group of patients without cancer and cirrhosis ( n = 48 ) will be presented and compared with results for the group of patients with cancer or cirrhosis ( n = 19 ) .
all analyses were done using stata version 9.2 .
significance was calculated with student 's t - test or chi squared test .
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in a two - sided test .
ethical consideration the central denmark region committee on biomedical research ethics confirmed that no approval was required for this study .
results basic data for patients without cancer and cirrhosis , mean age at time of admission was 44 +/ - 17 sd ( range 15 - 74 ) .
the group included 23 women and 25 men .
seventeen had acute pvt and 31 chronic pvt .
there was no difference in age between genders , but higher age in patients with acute ( 51 +/ - 16 ) compared to chronic ( 40 +/ - 16 ) pvt at time of diagnosis .
mean time elapsed from time of admission was 39 +/ - 41 months ( range 0 - 158 ) .
for patients with cancer and cirrhosis , mean age at time of admission was 57 +/ - 12 sd ( range 34 - 78 ) .
six were women and 13 men .
ten had acute pvt and 9 chronic pvt .
there was no difference in age between genders , or between acute and chronic pvt at time of diagnosis .
mean time elapsed from time of admission was 26 +/ - 27 months ( range 0 - 92 ) .

patients can have more than one risk factor .
risk factors were established in 58 cases ( 87 %) .
twenty - nine cases ( 43 %) had two risk factors , and 14 ( 21 %) had three risk factors .
when including all risk factors , 43 cases ( 64 %) had a local risk factor , and 28 cases ( 42 %) had a systemic risk factor .
analyses of patients without cancer or cirrhosis showed a difference of risk factors : 27 cases ( 56 %) had a local risk factor , and 24 cases ( 50 %) a systemic risk factor .
imaging methods in 51 ( 76 %) patients , diagnosis was established by means of doppler ultrasound. of 12 patients with a negative ultrasound , 11 were diagnosed by ct angiography and one by mri - scanning .
in four patients , the diagnosis was initially established with ct or mri .
in all patients diagnosed by means of doppler ultrasound , ct angiography was later performed .
mri - scanning was only performed in five of the patients with a positive doppler ultrasound , and supported the diagnosis in all five cases .
sensitivity was calculated to be 81 % ( 51 / 63 ) for doppler ultrasound and 94 % ( 51 / 54 ) for ct. anatomical location was in 65 cases ( 97 %) extrahepatic , and in two cases ( 3 %) intrahepatic .
in addition , patients with extrahepatic pvt also had intrahepatic thrombosis ( 54 %) and / or in the splenic vein ( 42 %) , and / or in superior mesenteric vein ( 31 %) , and one patient also had thrombosis of the inferior mesenteric vein .

fifty - nine patients had one or more complications .
among patients without cancer or cirrhosis , 72 % had oesophageal varices , 42 % gastric varices , 44 % portal hypertensive gastropathy , 29 % variceal haemorrhage , and 42 % ascites. of 36 patients with oesophageal varices , 20 ( 56 %) also had gastric varices .
oesophageal varices and bleeding were more frequent in patients with chronic pvt .
among patients with cancer or cirrhosis , 63 % had oesophageal varices , 42 % gastric varices , 37 % portal hypertensive gastropathy , 43 % variceal bleeding , and 42 % ascites. of 12 patients with oesophageal varices , six also had gastric varices .
treatment twenty - seven ( 56 %) of the patients without cancer or cirrhosis received anticoagulation therapy ( vitamin k - antagonist , low molecular weight heparin or heparin ) , compared with only 32 % of the patients with cancer or cirrhosis .
one patient with extensive thrombosis received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator , and in three patients , transjugular ( or transhepatic ) intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was established .
forty - five percent ( 10 acute and five chronic ) of the patients without cancer or cirrhosis who received anticoagulation therapy ( 16 acute and 11 chronic ) improved their portal flow with partial or complete recanalization during follow up. all four patients with cancer or cirrhosis and acute pvt ( 67 %) who received anticoagulation therapy had partial or complete recanalization .
among such patients who did not receive anticoagulation therapy ( n = 34 ) , only 15 % improved their portal flow and had any degree of spontaneous resolution of the thrombosis. of patients with oesophageal varices ( n = 48 ) , 60 % of the patients without , and ( n = 12 ) 75 % of patients with cancer of cirrhosis were treated endoscopically with band ligation ( vbl ) and / or sclerotherapy , in 24 % as primary prophylaxis .
forty - two percent of patients without and 17 % of patients with cancer or cirrhosis were treated with beta - blockers as primary prophylaxis. of patients with one or more variceal bleeding episodes ( n = 24 ) , 92 % of patients without and 80 % with cancer or cirrhosis were treated with vbl or sclerotherapy , and 88 % with and 90 % without cancer or cirrhosis with beta - blockers ( 24 % of these also with long - acting nitrates ) as secondary prophylaxis. of the patients with varices who were treated endoscopically , 90 % of patients with and 100 % without cancer or cirrhosis also received medical treatment with beta - blockers , and of these , respectively 58 % and 63 % showed regression of varices during follow - up. seven patients with varices received no treatment , and their varices remained unchanged or progressed .
mortality of patients without cancer or cirrhosis , eight ( 17 %) died during follow up. the causes of death were variceal bleeding ( n = 1 ) , profuse intrahepatic bleeding after trombolysis ( n = 1 ) , infection ( n = 1 ) , pulmonary embolism ( n = 1 ) , acute myocardial infarction ( n = 1 ) , florid pseudomembraneous colitis ( n = 1 ) and unknown ( n = 2 ). of patients with cancer and cirrhosis , six ( 32 %) patients died during follow - up ; causes of death were renal insufficiency ( n = 2 ) , liver failure ( n = 2 ) , cancer ( 1 ) and unknown ( 1 ) .
risk factors of pvt were cirrhosis ( n = 4 ) , prothrombotic disorder ( n = 4 ) , cancer ( n = 2 ) , unknown ( n = 2 ) , splenectomy ( n = 1 ) and chronic pancreatitis ( n = 1 ) .
within the first year after diagnosis of pvt ( and admission to our hospital ) , four ( 8 %) of the patients without cancer or cirrhosis died , and five ( 26 %) of the patients with cancer or cirrhosis died .
discussion retrospectively , we report risk factors and prognostic data on 67 patients with pvt referred to a single centre university hospital in denmark between 1992 and 2005 .
the main limitation of this study is lack of generalizability due to its retrospective nature ; however , large - scale randomised trials of such rare conditions can not be conducted , and , to our knowledge , this is one of the larger retrospective studies of pvt .
in accordance with previously published studies , we found that pvt developed because of several risk factors [ 9,15,16 ] .
in the restricted analysis , we found a combination of local ( 56 %) and systemic risk factors ( 50 %) .
denninger et al .
[ 17 ] reported a higher incidence of systemic factors ( 72 %) .
only 11 % of our pvt patients with cirrhosis and none of those with cancer were screened for coagulation disorders .
however , it is important systematically to screen patients with a life expectancy of more than 3 - 6 months and where anticoagulation therapy is considered relevant , and particularly cirrhosis patients , since 70 % of these reportedly have a genetic thrombogenic predisposition [ 18 ] .
the typical presentation of acute pvt was abdominalia , splenomegaly , fever and ascites , while the presentation of chronic pvt was abdominalia and splenomegaly together with gastrointestinal haemorrhages and ascites .
we found a higher frequency of abdominalia and fever in patients with acute pvt than in those with chronic pvt .
other studies report the same presentation , though ascites is described only in few cases of acute pvt [ 9,15 ] .
the high presenting occurrence of ascites among our patients may be due to the fact that we registered ascites both when detected by physical examination and by ultra sound , so that cases of slight ascites were included .
the ascites was in no case tense ( although some were treated with paracentesis to speed up recovery ) .
ascites in such patients is most likely caused by intestinal venous congestion , whereas the mechanisms leading to massive fluid retention are not activated as at sinusoidal portal hypertension .
frequent complications during follow - up were oesophageal - and gastric varices , portal hypertensive gastropathy , bleeding from varices and ascites .
a larger part of patients with chronic pvt developed oesophageal varices in comparison with patients with acute pvt .
thus , the development of varices is a time dependent phenomenon , and it is advisable to screen all pvt patients endoscopically .
twenty - nine percent of patients without cancer or cirrhosis experienced variceal bleeding ( in patients with cancer or cirrhosis 53 %) , in only one patient fatal , in accordance with other reports [ 6,19 ] .
spontaneous resolution of the thrombosis did happen in some cases , but the frequency of partial / complete recanalization seemed to be higher in patients treated with anticoagulation therapy .
the effect was seen in patients with both acute and chronic pvt .
the aim of anticoagulation therapy is both to prevent further thrombosis , and potentially lead to recanalization , thereby preventing the development of portal hypertension and its complications .
it has been suggested that interventional recanalization should be performed whenever the result of anticoagulation is unsatisfactory , and furthermore , that portal stents should be implanted in patients with cirrhosis [ 20 ] .
one study showed no increased rate of bleeding episodes in patients with established pvt who received anticoagulant therapy [ 6 ] .
however , to our knowledge , there is yet no consensus on the indication for anticoagulant therapy [ 9 ] .
for primary prophylaxis , beta - blockade is standard for cirrhotic portal hypertension , but the effect is not documented in pvt , and vbl may be preferable .
in the acute management of variceal bleeding , vasoactive substances , antibiotics , and vbl remain central .
for secondary prophylaxis of re - bleeding we used combined vbl and beta - blockade +/ - long - acting nitrates [ 7,8,21,22 ] although evidence to support beta - blockers is sparse [ 9 ] .
in any case , our patients showed regression of their varices when given this combination preventive treatment .
in accordance with others , we found that the outcome of pvt in general is good , and that mortality primarily was associated to underlying cause and less to the consequences of portal hypertension [ 6,20,23,24 ] .
mortality in one year was highest in patients with cancer or cirrhosis , 26 % compared with only 8 % in patients without these diseases .
conclusion in conclusion , most patients had a combination of local and systemic risk factors for pvt .
we observed that partial / complete recanalization was more frequent in patients treated with anticoagulation therapy , and that regression of varices was more pronounced in patients who were treated with active endoscopy combined with pharmacological treatment .

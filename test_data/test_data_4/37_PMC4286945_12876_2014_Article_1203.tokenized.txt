background helicobacter pylori ( hp ) and epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) have been associated with cancer development .
we evaluated the prevalence of hp , hp caga + and ebv infection in gastric cancer ( gc ) samples from adults and in gastric tissues from patients who underwent upper endoscopy ( ue ) .
methods samples from ue and gc were collected to investigate the presence of hp infection and the hp virulence factor caga by a urease test and pcr .
the presence of ebv was detected by eber - 1 in situ hybridization .
results in ue , 85.5 % of juvenile patients showed some degree of gastritis ( 45.3 % of patients with mild gastritis and 54.7 % with moderate / severe gastritis ) and patients with mild gastritis were younger than patients with moderate / severe gastritis .
among adults , 48.7 % presented mild gastritis and 51.3 % moderate / severe gastritis .
hp infection was detected in 0 % of normal mucosa , 58.5 % of juvenile gastritis patients , 69.2 % of adult gastritis patients and 88 % of gc patients .
in these same groups , hp caga + was detected in 0 % , 37.7 % , 61.5 % and 67.2 % of tissue samples , respectively .
in juvenile patients , hp infection was more common in those with gastritis than in normal samples ( p = 0.004 ) .
the patients with either hp or hp caga + were older than patients without these pathogens ( p < 0.05 ) .
in juvenile patients , hp infection was more frequent in cases of moderate / severe gastritis than in cases of mild gastritis ( p = 0.026 ) .
moreover , in patients with gc , hp infection was more frequent in males than in females ( p = 0.023 ) .
gc patients with hp caga + were older than patients with hp caga - ( p = 0.027 ) .
hp caga + was more common in intestinal - type than diffuse - type gc ( p = 0.012 ) .
hp caga + was also associated with lymph - node ( p = 0.024 ) and distal ( p = 0.005 ) metastasis .
no association between ebv infection and hp infection or any clinicopathological variable was detected .
conclusions our results suggest that hp is involved in the pathophysiology of severe gastric lesions and in the development of gc , particularly when caga + is present .
ebv was not the primary pathogenic factor in our samples .
keywords helicobacter pylori epstein - barr virus gastritis gastric cancer issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background gastric cancer ( gc ) and other gastrointestinal diseases occur at high rates worldwide [ 1 ] , and infections involving viruses and bacteria have been associated with these diseases .
recently , several studies have been performed to understand the role of pathogens that infect the human stomach , particularly helicobacter pylori ( hp ) and epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) , in gastric carcinogenesis [ 2 - 5 ] .
hp , a gram - negative spiral bacterium , is considered a public health problem .
in 1994 , the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc ) defined hp as a group 1 carcinogen [ 6 , 7 ] .
this bacterium colonizes the gastric mucosa of more than 50 % of the world 's population [ 8 ] .
however , only approximately 20 % of infected individuals develop severe gastric diseases such as gc. among the factors - that have been suggested to contribute to development of gastric disease in hp - infected patients are the virulence of hp strains , the permissiveness of the gastric environment and the host genetic background [ 9 ] .
the hp cytotoxicity associated gene a ( caga ) is one of the most significant virulence factors of this bacteria , and it has been associated with risk for gc [ 10 ] .
ebv infects more than 90 % of the global adult population , and most individuals are infected during childhood .
upon infection , the virus remains latent in b lymphocytes throughout life [ 5 ] .
to be oncogenic , ebv must maintain its genome inside host cells to avoid cell death and to evade recognition by the immune system .
the contribution of ebv to gastric carcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated [ 11 , 12 ] .
ebv infects epithelial cells from the oropharynx and subsequently spreads to the lymphoid tissues where it infects b lymphocytes [ 13 - 15 ] .
atrophic gastritis may induce the infiltration of ebv - carrying lymphocytes and increase the chance of their contact with the gastric epithelial cells .
on the other hand , the gastric inflammation may also produce a cytokine - rich microenvironment to support clonal growth of ebv - infected epithelial cells [ 16 ] .
in developing countries such as brazil , hp and ebv infections are particularly prevalent within lower socioeconomic populations .
furthermore , infection occurs at earlier ages in these populations compared to developed countries [ 17 - 19 ] .
studies are needed to determine these pathogens' association with and influence on the development of gastric diseases at earlier ages , where they could initiate or promote carcinogenic processes .
additionally , the role of hp and ebv in the development of gastric adenocarcinoma in the elderly , the population where this disease is most prevalent , remains unclear .
therefore , this study aimed to assess the prevalence of hp and ebv infection , as well as the caga - positive status of hp , in gastric tissues from juvenile and adult patients undergoing upper endoscopy ( ue ) and in tumor specimens from adult patients with gc. methods samples the present study included : ( i ) gastric tissue samples from 62 juvenile patients ranging from 12 months to 18 years old , referred for ue to clarify clinical manifestations within the upper gastrointestinal tract , ( ii ) gastric tissue samples from 39 adult patients ranging from 19 to 61 years old , referred for ue to clarify clinical manifestations within the upper gastrointestinal tract , and ( iii ) tumor samples from 125 adults , 26 to 89 years old , with primary gastric adenocarcinoma .
samples were randomly collected during the period of 2005 - 2013 in belem city of para state , northern brazil .
informed consent was obtained prior to sample collection from all adult patients or from the parents or guardians of all juvenile patients .
sample collection was carried out with the approval of the ethics committee of the human institute of health sciences of the federal university of para ( protocol # 35 / 2010 ) and joao de barros barreto university hospital ( protocol # 142004 ) .
all patients had negative histories of exposure to chemotherapy and radiotherapy prior to sample collection , and no patient presented with co - occurrence of diagnosed cancers .
data on the clinical features of patients were collected from medical records .
histopathology endoscopic findings were classified according to the updated sydney system [ 20 ] which considers the degree of inflammation , activity , atrophy and intestinal metaplasia .
for each patient , 5 biopsies of gastric tissues were evaluated : 2 from the antral region of the stomach , 1 from the incisura angularis , and 2 from the oxyntic mucosa .
chronic gastritis was designated as mild , moderate or severe .
gastric tumors were classified according to the lauren classification [ 21 ] and staged using standard criteria by ptnm staging [ 22 ] .

hp and cagadetection the presence of hp was detected by a commercially available rapid urease test ( promedical , brazil ) , and the negative results were confirmed by pcr using the oligonucleotides described by covacci et al .
[ 23 ] .
all gastric samples were placed in a tube containing 2 % christensen 's urea agar and examined for urea hydrolysis after 24 h of incubation at 37degreesc .
in the presence of urease produced by hp , the urea is converted to ammonia , resulting in a change of ph and , consequently , the color of the solution .
the detection of the caga gene was carried out by pcr in the gastric mucosa of all patients , using the oligonucleotides described by covacci et al .
[ 23 ] .
all reactions were performed in duplicate .
a sample was considered positive if a visible and clear band was observed on a 2 % agarose electrophoresis gel .
ebv detection ebv was detected by rna in situ hybridization ( ish ) with a 30 - bp biotinylated probe ( 5 ' - agacaccgtcctcaccacccgggacttgta - 3 ') complementary to ebv - encoded small rna - 1 ( eber1 ) , the most abundant viral product in latently infected cells [ 24 ] .
signal amplification was achieved with a mouse anti - biotin antibody ( clone bk , 1:20 dilution ; dakocytomation ( r ) , ca , usa ) and biotinylated rabbit anti - immunoglobulin antibody ( polyclonal , 1:100 dilution ; dakocytomation ( r ) , ca , usa ) .
the reaction was detected with streptavidin - biotin peroxidase complex ( dakocytomation ( r ) , ca , usa ) and diaminobenzidine chromogen ( dakocytomation ( r ) , ca , usa ) .
the slides were counterstained with harris 's hematoxylin .
cell analysis was performed by 2 independent investigators using light microscopy , at 40x or 20x magnification .
a total of 10 representative microscopic fields were evaluated , and fields containing less than 5 cells were not considered .
a gastric cancer sample positive for ebv was included as a positive control , and two slides treated without probe were used as negative controls .
samples where 5 % or more of the epithelial cells contained brown / red staining were considered positive .
although lymphocytes were also found to be infected by ebv , we did not include infected lymphoid cells in our analysis .
statistical analyses the shapiro - wilk test was used to evaluate the distribution of age data and to determine the appropriate subsequent test for statistical comparison .
the mann - whitney test ( non - parametric ) or t - test for independent samples ( parametric ) was used to compare ages between the groups .
associations between hp or ebv and other clinicopathological features were analyzed using chi - square ( chi2 ) and logistic regression .
a p - value less than 0.05 was considered significant , and the confidence interval was 95 % .
results we investigated 226 individuals , including 92 women and 134 men , divided into three groups .
the percentage of men was 38.7 % , 64.1 % and 68 % for juvenile ue patients , adult ue patients and gc patients , respectively .
the proportion of males was higher in the cohort of gc patients ( p < 0.001 , or = 3.365 , 95 % ci = 1.784 - 6.345 ) and adult ue patients ( p = 0.014 , or = 2.827 , 95 % ci = 1.233 - 6.485 ) than among juvenile ue patients .
among juvenile ue patients , 40 patients presented gastritis by ue. however , 59 % of patients without ue - diagnosed gastritis presented mild gastritis by histopathological analysis .
therefore , 53 ( 85.5 %) patients showed some degree of gastritis in the group of juvenile ue patients .
the age of patients without gastritis did not differ from that of patients with gastritis [ median +/ - interquartile range ( iqr ) : 7.33 +/ - 8 vs 10.23 +/ - 8 years old ; p = 0.080 , mann - whitney test ] .
however , patients with mild gastritis were younger than patients with moderate or severe gastritis ( mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) : 8.25 +/ - 4.30.90 vs 11.86 +/ - 4.27 years old ; p = 0.004 , t - test ) .
the gender breakdown did not differ between juvenile patients with and without gastritis ( p = 0.725 ) , as well as between juvenile patients with mild gastritis and moderate or severe gastritis ( p = 0.097 ) .
among adult ue patients , all of the evaluated individuals presented gastritis , including 19 ( 48.7 %) with mild gastritis and 20 ( 51.3 %) with moderate or severe gastritis .
patients with mild gastritis were younger than patients with moderate or severe gastritis ( mean +/ - sd : 37.47 +/ - 7.20 vs 46.50 +/ - 12.07 years old ; p = 0.003 , t - test ) .
the gender breakdown did not differ between juveniles patients with mild gastritis and moderate or severe gastritis ( p = 1 ) in this group of analysis.hp infection was detected in 0 % of normal gastric mucosa samples , 58.5 % of samples from juvenile gastritis patients , 69.2 % of adult gastritis samples and 88 % of gc patients ( figure 1a ) .
in juvenile individuals , hp infection was more frequently observed in gastritis samples than in normal samples ( p = 0.004 , yates correction ) .
the frequency of hp in adult gastritis did not differ from the observed frequency of gastritis in juvenile patients ( p = 1.000 , after adjustment for age and gender ) or in the gc samples ( p = 0.335 , after adjustment for age and gender ) .

in juvenile patients who underwent ue , gastritis patients with hp infection and with hp caga + were older than those without this pathogen ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.005 , respectively , t - test ; table 1 ) .
in this group of patients , hp infection was more prevalent in cases of moderate or severe gastritis than in those of mild gastritis ( p = 0.026 ; or = 5.136 , 95 % ci = 1.220 - 21.611 , after adjustment for age and gender ; table 1 ) .
as observed in juvenile patients , adults with gastritis who were also positive for hp infection and hp caga + were older than those without this pathogen ( p = 0.011 and p = 0.039 , respectively , t - test ; table 2 ) .
in tumor samples , patients with hp caga + were older than patients without hp caga - ( p = 0.027 , mann - whitney test ; table 3 ) .
hp caga + was more prevalent in intestinal - type than diffuse - type gc ( p = 0.012 ; or = 2.741 , 95 % ci 1.252 - 6.001 , after adjustment for age and gender ; table 3 ) .
the presence of hp caga + was also associated with lymph node metastasis ( p = 0.024 ; or = 5.611 , 95 % ci = 1.255 - 25.097 , after adjustment for age and gender ) and distal metastasis ( p = 0.005 ; or 3.299 , 95 % ci = 1.441 - 7.556 , after adjustment for age and gender ; table 3 ) .
ebv infection was detected in 0 % of normal gastric mucosa samples , 3.8 % of samples from juvenile gastritis patients , 5.1 % of samples from adult gastritis patients and 9.6 % of gc patients ( figure 1c and figure 2 ) .
in the gastric mucosa , we found that 5 - 15 % of cells were infected .
rates of ebv infection did not differ among normal gastric mucosa and mucosa from juvenile patients with gastritis ( p > 0.05 , yates correction ) .
moreover , the frequency of ebv infection in the gastritis of adults did not differ from that observed in the gastritis of juvenile patients and gc samples ( p > 0.05 , after adjustment for age and gender ) .
no association between ebv infection and hp infection or any clinicopathological variable was found ( p > 0.05 , table 1 , 2 and 3 ) .
figure 2 detection of ebv by in situ hybridization .
strong nuclear staining was observed in infected nuclei in a a ) mild gastritis ( 40x ) and b ) adult moderate gastritis .
although we did not observe a statistically significant association between the two pathogens , only one ebv - positive case was found without concomitant hp infection .
this case was an 18 - year - old female with no sign of gastric disease by ue evaluation and mild gastritis by histopathological analysis .
discussion infection by hp and ebv occurs most often during childhood , and both viruses can synergistically enhance the alteration of gastric mucosa to chronic gastritis and gc [ 6 , 17 , 19 , 25 ] .
gastritis is more likely to occur in older adults but can affect people of all ages , including children .
many studies [ 26 , 27 ] have attempted to understand the development of gastritis in children .
souza et al .
[ 28 ] , identified endoscopic abnormalities in 74 % of the children and adolescents studied .
among these , 26 % ( 7 / 21 ) had gastritis as determined by ue. in our study , gastritis was identified by ue in a larger number of juvenile patients ( 40 / 62 ) .
however , finding an apparently normal mucosa by endoscopy does not exclude the possibility of pathological change , as biopsy is required for a definitive determination .
our results confirm this assertion because in 22 normal endoscopic exams , only 9 showed a normal histological pattern .
in addition , patients with mild gastritis were younger than patients with moderate or severe gastritis , perhaps because they had not yet been exposed to many aggressive agents that can lead to gastritis [ 6 ] .
in the present study , hp infection was detected in most of the ue patients and gc samples , although the techniques used may underestimate the presence of the bacteria .
other studies in brazil , such as those by gatti et al .
[ 29 ] and souza et al .
[ 28 ] , reported the prevalence of hp infection in juveniles to be 51 % and 60 % , respectively .
these results are consistent with our findings .
an investigation in other developing countries also showed a similar frequency ( 61.8 %) [ 30 ] .
in adults , a slightly higher frequency was found in other studies in brazilian ( 88.4 %) [ 31 ] and african ( 70 - 97 %) populations [ 32 ] .
these numbers most likely reflect the social and health conditions of the studied populations because infections by hp are more common in developing countries than in developed countries [ 19 ] .
in our study , hp infection was more common in cases of moderate or severe gastritis than in juveniles with mild gastritis .
similarly , alvarez et al .
[ 31 ] found a higher frequency of moderate and severe gastritis in patients infected by hp. additionally , we observed that the prevalence of hp , particularly hp caga + , increased with age , corroborating previous investigations in populations from northeastern brazil , china , and japan [ 31 - 33 ] .
it has been suggested that the earlier hp infection occurs , the greater the risk for gc due to chronic inflammatory reactions to the infection [ 34 ] .
in the population studied here , the frequency of infection by hp or hp caga + in gc patients did not differ from that observed in adults patients with gastritis .
however , some studies have found that the spontaneous disappearance of hp during malignant transformation of gastric epithelia is possible [ 35 , 36 ] .
nevertheless , cancer still occurs after successful eradication of hp ; therefore , eradication of hp does not lead to a significant decrease in the incidence of gastric cancer [ 37 ] .
furthermore , it has been observed that the eradication of hp must occur before carcinomatous change develops [ 38 ] .
this finding highlights the necessity of epidemiological studies to understand the incidence and prevalence of hp in a population and to help in the development of population - specific strategies to prevent and control hp. the prevalence of hp in gastric tumors varies with the country being analyzed [ 39 ] .
in brazil , a previous study detected this bacteria in 85.7 % of gastric tumor samples [ 40 ] , which is similar to the frequency observed in our study ( 88 %) .
in addition , we observed that the frequency of hp was 1.5 - times greater in gc samples than in juvenile gastritis samples , and almost ninety times higher than in normal gastric mucosa , highlighting a strong association between hp and the process of gastric carcinogenesis .
after initial infection by hp , patients develop acute gastritis .
this may resolve spontaneously , but the majority of cases progress to chronic gastritis [ 41 ] .
the clinical outcome of hp infection is determined by the complex interaction between host factors and bacteria [ 42 ] .
caga is likely the most significant virulence factor [ 43 ] and is strongly associated with the risk for gc [ 42 ] .
it is known that the basic caga genotype acquired in childhood remains throughout life [ 44 ] .
hp caga + strains have been associated with more intense inflammation and greater bacterial density , as well as progression to gastric atrophy , peptic ulcer and gastric cancer [ 43 ] .
however , the involvement of hp caga + in gastric carcinogenesis in brazilian individuals is still controversial .
oliveira et al .
[ 45 ] found an association between the presence of caga with more marked antral inflammation in duodenal ulcers ( 90 %) and gastric carcinoma ( 94.23 %) in brazilian adults .
in another study of the brazilian population , gatti et al .
[ 29 ] found a slightly greater frequency ( 69 %) of caga + in patients with chronic gastritis .
however , the authors did not find any association between caga + strains and chronic gastritis , suggesting that other bacterial factors are involved in disease genesis .
consistent with this , in our study we did not find an association between hp caga + and the presence of gastritis .
however , hp caga + was associated with poor prognostic variables in gc cancer .
here , the caga + genotype was associated with the age , histological subtype and metastatic process of gc patients .
unlike kuo et al .
[ 46 ] , we found a higher frequency of caga + patients in the older cohort of our brazilian population .
moreover , the presence of hp caga + was higher in intestinal - type than in diffuse - type gc. the transformation in gastric mucosa induced by hp caga + is similar to the alterations that occur in the intestinal - type of gc [ 2 , 47 ] ; thus , finding the highest frequency ( 84.6 %) of caga + in intestinal - type gc is reasonable .
additionally , the presence of hp caga + may induce tumor alterations that lead to metastasis .
kong et al .
[ 48 ] observed that hp stimulates the synthesis of cacul1 in a gastric tumor cell line , which in turn promotes the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and increases invasion and metastasis .
approximately 7 % of our patients presented ebv infection in gastric tissue samples .
none of these patients presented symptoms of mononucleosis .
therefore , ebv infection in gastric mucosa is not necessarily associated with infection in lymph nodes or tonsils .
the frequency of infection by ebv in gc ( 9.6 %) was similar to the frequency previously described in other populations ( approximately 7.3 - 13 %) [ 49 - 51 ] .
however , the prevalence of ebv infection in patients with gastritis ( 3.8 % among juvenile and 5.1 % among adults ) was reduced in comparison to the prevalence reported in the literature .
ryan et al .
[ 25 ] found ebv sequences in 83 % ( 5 / 6 ) of adult and 30 % ( 15 / 50 ) of pediatric gastritis lesions .
the low frequency identified in gastric mucosa of the younger patients may be because the stomach is not the primary location for b lymphocytes immortalized by ebv infection .
the gastric mucosa does not seem to possess the necessary homing mechanism for settlement by these infected lymphocytes [ 5 ] .
although our results suggest that ebv is not critical for the initial steps of gastric mucosal injury in the brazilian population , the presence of ebv genomes and their expression in gastric carcinoma cells raises the possibility that this virus may contribute to neoplastic transformation .
notably , ebv was found within the malignant cells in approximately 10 % of gastric adenocarcinomas , and this infection seems to precede malignant transformation [ 52 ] .
additionally , a previous in vitro study reported that reactive products from hp infection trigger ebv reactivation in latently infected gastric epithelial cells [ 53 ] .
inflammatory stress that occurs during the malignization of gastric cells may lead to infiltration of lymphocytes carrying ebv .
this process may increase the possibility of contact with epithelial cells , or it may produce a rich medium that supports the cytokine - stimulated clonal replication of ebv - infected epithelial cells [ 16 ] .
recently , cardenas - mondragon [ 54 ] reported that co - infection with ebv and hp caga + was associated with the presence of severe gastritis , reveling a critical role for ebv in gastric mucosal alterations .
here , we did not find an association between ebv and hp or the presence of caga in our gastritis or cancer samples , most likely due to the low frequency of ebv .
the main limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size .
therefore , some of the statistical analyses presented reduced the power to detect significant differences between groups .
therefore , further investigations are still necessary to fully understand the roles of ebv and hp in gastric carcinogenesis in the brazilian population .
conclusion our results strongly suggest that hp is involved in the pathophysiology of severe gastric lesions and development of gc in infected juveniles and adults .
furthermore , the frequency of these pathologies increases with age .
hp caga + was associated with greater inflammation and more advanced stage of cancer .
ebv was not the primary pathogenic factor in our sample .
additionally , a better understanding of the most prevalent strains of pathogens , and their associated antigens , will be valuable for the development of vaccines clinical protocols for screening and treating infection .

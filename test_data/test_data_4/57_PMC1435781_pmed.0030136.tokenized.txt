universities allied for essential medicines , a coalition of students and faculty across north america , focuses on how academic research institutions can help to improve access to essential medicines .
according to the world health organization , about 10 million people - - most of them in low - and middle - income countries - - die needlessly every year because they do not have access to existing medicines and vaccines [ 1 ] .
countless others suffer from neglected tropical diseases , such as sleeping sickness , lymphatic filariasis , and blinding trachoma , for which there are still too few safe or effective medicines [ 2 ] .
drug companies have traditionally been reluctant to develop drugs for neglected diseases because the patients are too poor to pay for them , so there is no financial incentive for drug development .
comprehensive solutions are thus needed to increase both access to existing medicines and research on neglected diseases .
these solutions must involve strengthening health - care systems in poor countries , increasing financial flows for the most pressing public health crises , and better matching our research and development efforts to the needs of the poor .
the challenges of making such wholesale changes are daunting [ 3 ] .
our organization , universities allied for essential medicines ( uaem ) ( box 1 ) , a coalition of students and faculty at about 25 universities across north america , focuses on the role of academic research institutions as a starting point for closing the access and research gaps .
to be sure , much of the recent progress in global health research and awareness can be attributed to universities .
yet we must go further .
as medical students , we have a unique ability to " turn the spotlight inward " by calling attention to our universities' responsibilities when it comes to essential medicines .
why universities ?
university research is vital to the development of new medicines ; total biomedical research expenditures at universities were us $ 19.6 billion in 2002 [ 4,5 ] .
meanwhile , the principles that guide universities - - creating and disseminating knowledge for public benefit - - are well aligned with the goal of improving access to medicines globally .
in addition , many universities have offices responsible for transferring academic innovations ( those arising from university research ) to the commercial sector .
such transfer allows these innovations to be further developed and marketed so that they can benefit the public ; universities rarely have the resources to do such development and marketing themselves .
university technology transfer offices aim to embody the same guiding principles as those of the university itself .
for example , the center for technology transfer at the university of pennsylvania explicitly states that its chief objective is to " commercialize penn research discoveries for the public good " ( see http :// www.ctt.upenn.edu /) .
university research is vital to the development of new medicines .
in most instances , the transfer of an innovation from a university to a for - profit company means that the university relinquishes control over the subsequent development and marketing of a medicine .
this raises the possibility that the company will put the medicine out of reach of poor patients , either by charging prices that poor patients cannot afford or through legal maneuvers that otherwise restrict access in poor countries .
however , two recent cases demonstrate that universities can influence access to such medicines .
first , in 2001 , the humanitarian organization medecins sans frontieres sought the permission of yale university to use a generic version of zerit ( stavudine ) , an antiretroviral drug for hiv infection , to treat south african patients .
medecins sans frontieres made this request because it had gathered evidence that generic stavudine could be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the expensive branded version available in south africa ; the cost savings would permit an expansion in the number of patients who could be treated for hiv .
yale university owned the patent for stavudine , but the university had granted an exclusive license that conferred intellectual property rights for the medicine to the drug company bristol - myers squibb ( new york , new york , united states of america ) .
the request from medecins sans frontieres prompted global attention and intense discussions between the university and bristol - myers squibb [ 6 ] .
the result was the first patent concession on an hiv drug - - that is , bristol - myers squibb allowed generic stavudine to be bought and sold within south africa - - and a 30 - fold reduction in the price of the patented drug in south africa .
the impact of this intervention from medecins sans frontieres , and from yale 's negotiations with the drug company , was indisputable .
rapid expansion of hiv - treatment programs in sub - saharan africa would not have been possible without the widespread availability of generic stavudine , a treatment recommended by the world health organization as first - line therapy for hiv / aids [ 7 ] .
a second example further demonstrates the leverage universities can have in improving access to medicines .
scientists at emory university ( atlanta , georgia , united states of america ) had conducted research that contributed to the development of the antiretrovirals , emtriva ( emtricitabine ) and truvada ( emtricitabine and tenofovir ) .
these discoveries were transferred to industry through an intellectual property agreement that stipulated that the university would receive royalty payments for any drugs developed from the emory research .
last year , in a deal with gilead sciences ( foster city , california , united states of america ) and royalty pharma ( new york city , new york , united states of america ) , emory sold its rights to those royalties for a lump sum payment of us $ 525 million [ 8 ] .
the magnitude of the deal , which was the largest - ever transaction of its kind for an academic institution , caught the attention of student activists at emory , who investigated gilead 's provisions for access to emtriva and truvada in poor countries and found them lacking [ 9 ] .
emory students are currently engaged in discussions with the university administration about gilead 's access practices , armed with a straightforward but cogent argument : emory could have received the same royalty payment while advocating for greater access to emtriva and truvada for patients in poor countries. that is , expanding access does not require that universities sacrifice their bottom line .
the reason for this is simple : the patients who are n't currently able to afford the drugs they so desperately need do not factor into either gilead 's revenue or ( by extension ) emory 's royalties .
closing the access and research gaps : policy proposals for universities the case of emory and the two medicines emtriva and truvada highlights the difficulty of crafting retrospective solutions to problems that should have been foreseen .
ideas on how to prevent similar situations from arising in the future have been circulating in academic and policy circles over the past two years .
for instance , in 2005 the american academy of arts and sciences ( cambridge , massachusetts , united states of america ) published a report exploring how to license university discoveries to drug companies in a way that still ensures that the drugs can be accessed for humanitarian uses [ 10 ] .
the report argued that humanitarian licensing practices would involve " a provision in a license whereby inventors and technology suppliers protect in advance the possibility of sharing their proprietary technology with third parties for the benefit of people in need. " the association of university technology managers ( northbrook , illinois , united states of america ) has convened a group known as technology managers for global health to look at how university research can be optimally exploited to advance global health outcomes ( http :// www.tmgh.org ) .
our own organization , uaem , has drafted recommendations that we advocate for individual institutions through our university - based chapters [ 11 ] .
uaem proposes that universities make changes in both their principles and policies in order to improve access to medicines in poor countries .
we recommend that universities adopt an official resolution that improving global human welfare is the most important goal of university technology transfer .
to satisfy this principle , we put forward two specific policy proposals : ( 1 ) universities should adopt licensing provisions that facilitate access to their health - related innovations in poor countries , and ( 2 ) universities should promote research on neglected tropical diseases and find ways to work with nontraditional partners ( such as developing - world research institutions and public - private partnerships ) that seek to develop medicines for these diseases .
we advocate a set of humanitarian licensing provisions known as " equitable access licensing ," which is designed to do a number of things that traditional university licenses typically do not do. for example , under the equitable access license ( eal ) , when certain conditions in the license are met ( e.g. , when a generic pharmaceutical company in a poor country notifies the university that a key medicine is overpriced there ) , patent barriers are lifted .
under the eal , the intellectual property required to make that product is open to anyone that wants to use it to increase access in poor countries. and so a generic pharmaceutical company wanting to produce a medicine in a poor country wo n't get sued for doing so , as long as the conditions that trigger the license are met .
beyond humanitarian licensing , we advocate the institution of policies to promote neglected - disease research .
specifically , we recommend that the universities facilitate participation in innovative research activities such as public - private partnerships ( in which the public sector teams up with the commercial sector ) .
we also recommend that universities promote projects that hold potential for neglected - disease drug development [ 12 ] .
such promotion includes removing any barriers that prevent university scientists from accepting research funding from public - private partnerships , proactively monitoring university innovations for potential neglected - disease applicability , and ensuring that university intellectual property does not serve as an impediment for scientists working on neglected diseases , either within universities or elsewhere .
full details of both the eal and our neglected - disease policies have been laid out elsewhere [ 13 ] .
addressing counterarguments the unique appeal of an eal is that it promotes true generic competition in poor countries .
we anticipate , however , that the feasibility of our proposal will raise a number of doubts , some of which we attempt to address here .
first , it is important to note that for any given product , a pharmaceutical company 's bottom line would remain relatively intact .
equitable access licensing works by dividing the world pharmaceutical market between rich and poor countries .
consider , for example , any university innovation that has been developed into a drug. that drug can remain under patent protection in high - income countries , where the pharmaceutical industry earns the vast majority of its revenue .
generic competition is allowed only in markets where there is little access - - and , therefore , little revenue - - in the first place .
logo of universities allied for essential medicines ( image : uaem ) licensees may express disquiet about cheaper generic products overcoming regulatory ( customs ) barriers and entering high - income markets illegally .
however , there is no empirical evidence of any substantial flows of medicine from poorer countries to high - income countries [ 14 ] .
insofar as such diversion is a concern , eal signatories can address it in the same manner that the world trade organization has - - by requiring the use of different packaging , pill color , and pill shape in different countries to facilitate the identification of illegal imports [ 15 ] .
another concern universities may have is whether the eal is financially viable for universities .
this concern is not justified , because pharmaceutical companies would not lose a significant amount of revenue as a result of the eal , and any decrease in licensing revenue at a given university would be vanishingly small .
the fact that licensing revenues typically account for about 4 % of university research funds underscores the point that universities would not suffer ill effects from implementing equitable access licensing [ 16 ] .
finally , aside from any intangible benefits research institutions might derive from being leaders in responding to an important humanitarian issue , there are reasons to believe that pioneering universities stand to gain financially by adopting our proposals .
combining accessoriented licensing policies with an augmented neglected - disease research agenda can help universities position themselves as research centers for foundation - sponsored partnerships .
the burgeoning field of public - private partnerships for global health research has attracted over us $ 1.2 billion in funding from sources such as the gates foundation , the vast majority of which is contracted out to research scientists [ 17 ] .
the university of california berkeley ( berkeley , california , united states of america ) has recently begun marketing its " socially responsible licensing initiative " as a way to attract some of this nontraditional funding and has already signed a handful of deals with foundations and other nonprofits under that licensing rubric [ 18 ] .
in our role as students , uaem members have even loftier aspirations : to foment a collective movement that ensures that our universities' innovations reach those who need them the most .
box 1 .
universities allied for essential medicines who we are uaem is a coalition of students and faculty at about 25 research universities across north america .
our goal is to improve access to medicines in poor countries through university action .
what we do our activities take place at both the chapter level and the international level .
at the chapter level , we petition for changes in the policies and practices at the universities we attend .
for example , at the university of california berkeley , administrators announced a socially responsible licensing initiative ( http :// ipira.berkeley.edu / docs / sociallyresponsible.pdf ) that arose in part through discussions with the berkeley uaem chapter .
at the international level , we convene groups of students - - in consultation with faculty members and other experts - - to determine how best to improve access to medicines in poor countries through research and policy analysis .
for example , a consensus uaem policy statement was released in october 2005 after a meeting at georgetown university ( washington , d. c. , united states of america ) that brought together more than 75 students representing 28 universities ( see http :// www.essentialmedicine.org / oct2005policystatement.pdf ) .

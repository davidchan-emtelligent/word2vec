here we show that mice with a adipocyte - specific deletion of the sumo - specific protease senp1 gene develop symptoms of type - 1 diabetes mellitus ( t1dm ) , including hyperglycaemia and glucose intolerance with mild insulin resistance .
peri - pancreatic adipocytes from senp1 - deficient mice exhibit heightened nf - kappab activity and production of proinflammatory cytokines , which induce ccl5 expression in adjacent pancreatic islets and direct cytotoxic effects on pancreatic islets .
mechanistic studies show that senp1 deletion in adipocytes enhances sumoylation of the nf - kappab essential molecule , nemo , at lysine 277 / 309 , leading to increased nf - kappab activity , cytokine production and pancreatic inflammation .
we further show that nf - kappab inhibitors could inhibit pre - diabetic cytokine production , beta - cell damages and ameliorate the t1dm phenotype in senp1 - deficient mice .
feeding a high - fat diet augments both type - 1 and type - 2 diabetes phenotypes in senp1 - deficient mice , consistent with the effects on adipocyte - derived nf - kappab and cytokine signalling .
our study reveals previously unrecognized mechanism regulating the onset and progression of t1dm associated with adipocyte dysfunction .
pro - inflammatory nf - kappab signalling is regulated by protein sumoylation .
here the authors show that lack of the desumoylating protease senp1 in fat tissue induces nf - kappab activity and inflammation in peri - pancreatic adipocytes , leading to symptoms of type 1 diabetes in mice .
one of the key phenotype of type - 1 diabetes mellitus ( t1dm ) is characterized by the autoimmune - mediated destruction of the pancreatic beta cells .
the autoimmune attack on the pancreatic beta cells can be detected years before clinical onset of t1dm - related autoantibodies in the blood123 .
prospective studies of t1dm have established that t1dm exhibits the elevated levels of inflammatory markers before diagnosis of diabetes .
there is a significant elevation in the interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) , c - reactive protein ( crp ) , tumour necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) and il - 1beta levels in preclinical diabetes samples .
these cytokines can induce beta - cell death in t1dm4 .
the autoimmunity may occur because of instructive immune responses23 .
persistent elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in the body can be defined as a risk factor that , either alone or in combination with other environment factors , may predispose to the loss of self - tolerance and the onset of t1dm - related autoantibodies .
adipose tissue functions are closely linked to development of diabetes , particularly type - 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2dm ) .
the roles of adipose tissue in glucose metabolism , lipodystrophy and insulin resistance are well known56 .
recent studies indicate that adipose tissue is not simply the organ that stores fat and regulates lipid metabolism but also is the largest endocrine organ with immune functions5 .
adipocytes produce several mediators , such as adiponectin , resistin , il - 6 , tnf - alpha , leptin , monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 ( or ccl2 ) and il - 1beta , all of which participate in the immune response as proinflammatory mediators .
it is reported that adipocytes are responsible for almost one - third of the il - 6 concentration in diabetic patients5 .
one of the critical activators of inflammatory genes is nf - kappab78 .
experimental evidences have suggested that sumoylation components regulate nf - kappab signalling and transcriptional activity910 .
nemo is part of the cytoplasmic ikappabalpha kinase ( ikk ) complex that is critical for nf - kappab activation not only by the majority of extracellular signals , including tnf - alpha and il - 1beta , but also in response to many genotoxic stress agents .
nemo is sumo1 modified on k277 / k309 with the help of sumo e1 / e2 and an e3 ( piasy ) 11 .
the reverse sumoylation of nemo by sumo endopeptidases ( senps ) plays an important role in inhibiting nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells ( nf - kappab ) activity and nf - kappab - dependent transcriptional activation1213 .
as a post - translational modification , sumoylation is involved in various cellular processes , such as nuclear - cytosolic transport , transcriptional regulation , apoptosis , protein stability , response to stress and cell cycle progression .
sumoylation is a dynamic process that is mediated by activating , conjugating and ligating enzymes , and is readily reversed by a family of desumoylating proteases senps1415 .
senp1 is a desumoylating protease that deconjugates a large number of sumoylated proteins14 .
previously , we and others have observed that a global deletion of senp1 causes deficient haematopoiesis and prenatal lethality1617 , therefore excluding further studies on the role of senp1 in inflammation and diabetes .
interestingly , several components in sumoylation have been identified as candidate genes implicated in t1dm susceptibility1819 .
however , the underlying mechanism by which sumoylation pathway regulates t1dm , and whether or not the sumoylation signalling play a role in adipocyte is unclear .
therefore , in the present study , we attempt to address whether persistent protein sumoylation in adipocytes affects t1dm onset and progression .
we have created genetically modified mice with an adipocyte - specific deletion of senp1 with three different adipocyte - specific cre deleter lines .
our present data show that adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice are viable but develop the major phenotypes of t1dm , including hyperglycaemia , glucose intolerance , increases in cytotoxic t cells and autoantibody production .
this diabetic phenotype observed in senp1 - deficient mice is associated with high sumoylation of nemo , a key component regulating nf - kappab , in pancreatic adipocytes .
our data suggest that nemo sumoylation in adipocytes is a strong risk factor in t1dm .
results senp1 - deficient mice exhibit t1dm phenotype to investigate possible function of senp1 in inflammation and diabetes , we created genetically modified mice with an adipocyte - specific deletion of senp1 with three different deleter lines carrying the cre recombinase driven by the adiponectin , pdgfralpha or ap2 / fabp4 gene promoter ( named as senp1 - adipoqko , senp1 - pdgfrko and senp1 - ap2ko , respectively ; supplementary fig. 1a ) .
while the pdgfralpha - cre is predominantly expressed in bipotent progenitor adipocytes ( white and beige adipocytes ) 2021 , the adipoq - cre has high efficiency and specificity in mature adipocytes2223 .
the ap2 - cre has a moderate efficiency in adipocytes242526 with variable degrees of target gene recombination in macrophages27 or capillary endothelium in a floxed gene locus - dependent manner2223 .
senp1 expression ( messenger rna ( mrna ) and protein ) was diminished in isolated adipocytes from interscapular brown adipose tissue , perigonadal white adipose tissue and peri - pancreatic adipose tissue ( pat ) of senp1 - adipoqko , senp1 - pdgfrko ( with less efficiency in brown adipose tissue ) and senp1 - ap2ko mice compared with the control senp1lox / lox ( ctrl ) .
in contrast , senp1 expression was intact in isolated macrophages ( cd11b + f4 / 80 +) and pancreatic islets from these mice ( supplementary fig. 1b - c ) .
moreover , enhanced green fluorescent protein was detected in pats but not in pancreatic islets when ap2 - cre deleter mice mating with mt / mg reporter mice ( supplementary fig. 1d ) .
senp1 - adipoqko , senp1 - pdgfrko and senp1 - ap2ko mice were viable after birth .
however , these adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice all developed a diabetic phenotype ( fig. 1a - c ) .
an age - dependent increase in glucose levels was observed in senp1 - adipoqko , senp1 - pdgfrko and senp1 - ap2ko mice compared with the control senp1lox / lox mice with an early onset of diabetes in senp1 - pdgfrko at the age of 6 weeks ( blood glucose level > 225 mg dl - 1 ) ; this earlier onset of hyperglycaemia is consistent with the high efficiency of pdgfralpha - cre in adipocyte progenitors .
we observed similar phenotypic changes in both male ( fig. 1a - c ) and female with or without fasting , and we focused on male mice for further studies .
we measured glucose levels in senp1 - smko and senp1 - ecko mice , in which the senp1 gene was specifically deleted in smooth muscle cells / pericytes by sm22alpha - cre ( senp1 - smko ) and in vascular endothelial cells by ve - cadherin - cre ( senp1 - ecko ) , respectively2829 .
unlike senp1 - ap2ko mice , senp1 - smko and senp1 - ecko mice did not develop a high - glucose phenotype even at the age of 14 weeks ( fig. 1d ) .
insulin levels in plasma were measured at various ages , and insulin secretion in senp1 - adipoqko and senp1 - ap2ko mice was significantly declined after the ages of 8 and 10 weeks , respectively ( fig. 1e,f ) .
glucose tolerance test ( gtt ) and insulin tolerance test ( itt ) were performed at the age of 14 weeks to evaluate diabetes and insulin resistance .
the level of hyperglycaemia observed with the gtt was prolonged in senp1 - adipoqko and senp1 - ap2ko mice compared with ctrl mice ( fig. 1g - j ) .
however , similar insulin responses were observed between senp1 - deficient mice and ctrl in the itt assays ( fig. 1k,l for ap2ko mice ) .
we then performed glucose - stimulated insulin assay with isolated islets .
glucose - stimulated insulin secretion from senp1 - deficient islets was significantly reduced ( fig. 1m ) .
these data suggest that the high glucose level in senp1 - deficient mice was due to reduced insulin secretion .
the body weight and body mass are associated with the development of diabetes and increases in glucose levels .
all senp1 - deficient mice had lower body weights compared with the control mice after onset of diabetes ( fig. 2a - d ) .
however , adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice exhibited normal lipid profiles up to the age of 14 weeks , including total cholesterol , low - density lipoprotein , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) , triglyceride ( tg ) and free fatty acid ( ffa ) .
cholesterol and tg , but not hdl or ffa , were slightly reduced in senp1 - ap2ko mice after the age of 18 weeks ( fig. 2e - g ) .
water consumption and food - intake monitoring showed that senp1 - ap2ko mice had increased water consumption with similar dairy food uptake compared with ctrl mice ( fig. 2h - i ) .
taken together , the assays described above suggest that type - 1 - like diabetic phenotypes developed in the adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice .
senp1 deficient mice show autoimmune mediated damages insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus results from t - cell - mediated destruction of insulin - producing pancreatic islet beta cells123 .
to determine the pathogenesis of diabetes in senp1 - deficient mice , we examined pancreatic development and pathology by haematoxylin and eosin stain and immunostaining for pancreatic beta - cell number , mass and morphology changes , as well as immune cell invasion , indicative of insulitis .
at early ages before the onset of hyperglycaemia , no significant differences were detected in pancreatic mass , beta - cell number between the ctrl and senp1 - deficient mice .
however , the structures of pancreatic islets in senp1 - adipoqko , senp1 - pdgfrko and senp1 - ap2ko mice were drastically disrupted with increased tdt - mediated dutp nick end labelling ( tunel ) - positive apoptosis of beta cells after onset of diabetes and more severe at late stages ( fig. 3a - c for senp1 - ap2ko ; supplementary fig. 2 for senp1 - adipoqko and senp1 - pdgfrko ) .
there was a sharp decline in insulin staining and cd31 + vascular area in the islets in senp1 - ap2ko mice ( fig. 3d with quantifications in fig. 3e ) , indicating a loss of function in the beta cell with disrupted vasculatures .
these data provide direct evidence in support of apoptosis as the mechanism of beta - cell death in senp1 - deficient mice .
immune cell - specific effector t - cell invasion in the pancreatic tissue attacks the islets and induces cell death .
we observed an accumulation of white blood cells invasion into the islets in senp1 - deficient mice .
in t1dm , beta cell and islets are attacked by activated cytotoxic t cells3031 .
the section staining in the pancreases demonstrated that cd8 + t cells were absent from the islets of ctrl mice .
no pancreatic infiltrations of immune cells were detected in the senp1 - ap2ko mice under the age of 7 weeks .
however , cd8 + t cells infiltrated into the islets of senp1 - ap2ko mice by the age of 12 weeks ( fig. 3f,g ) .
similar results were observed for cd4 + t cells ( supplementary fig. 3a - b ) .
these data strongly suggest a t - cell dominant mechanism for beta - cell destruction .
the pre - diabetic phase of the disease usually begins several years before the clinical onset of the disease .
during this phase , autoantibodies , mainly insulin autoantibody ( iaa ) , are directed against beta cells .
iaa levels , along with other clinical information , aid in the diagnosis of t1dm3233 .
crp and beta - hydroxybutyrate are important clinical parameters for the diagnosis of diabetes34 .
individuals who develop diabetes typically have higher crp levels .
beta - hydroxybutyrate is classified as ketones that are produced in the body when the body loses its ability to absorb glucose properly .
senp1 - ap2ko mice had increased levels of iaa in the blood as measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) with an iaa - specific antibody .
greater levels of crp and beta - hydroxybutyrate were also observed in the blood of senp1 - ap2ko mice ( fig. 3h - j ) .
all of the above data support the appearance of typical t1dm in senp1 - ap2ko mice .
we then fully characterized the immune system in the senp1 - deficient mice .
we transplanted skin from mice ( balb / c ) to ctrl senp1lox / lox and senp1 - ap2ko mice ( c57bl / 6 background ) .
severe skin - rejection response appeared in both ctrl and senp1 - ap2ko mice at an equal level , indicating senp1 - ap2ko mice are not immunodeficient ( supplementary fig. 3c ) .
we examined the immune cell populations in pancreas , pancreatic lymph nodes and spleen of senp1 - deficient mice .
the distribution of immune cells in the pancreases was determined by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) analyses with specific surface markers .
mhcii + cd11b + cd11c - macrophages , cd3e + t cells and cd19 + b cells were markedly increased in the pancreases of senp1 - ap2ko versus the ctrl mice ( supplementary fig. 3d for facs and fig. 3k for quantifications ) .
subset t cells play a key role in regulation of inflammation and immune tolerance35 .
we observed that th1 ( ifn - gamma + cd4 +) and th17 ( il - 17 + cd4 +) effector t - cell subsets expanded concomitant with reduction of regulatory t - cell subset ( cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 +) in the pancreatic lymph nodes of senp1 - ap2ko mice ( supplementary fig. 3e - g for facs and fig. 3l for quantifications ) .
we also observed an increase in activated dendritic cells in the lymph node of pancreases ( fig. 3m ) .
moreover , an autoantigen nrp - v7 - positive cd8 + t cells , targeting a peptide from islet - specific glucose - 6 - phosphatase catalytic subunit - related protein36 , were detected in the pancreatic lymph nodes and the spleen of senp1 - ap2ko mice at the age of 12 weeks ( supplementary fig. 3h for facs and fig. 3n,o for quantifications ) .
all of the events suggest autoimmune responses occur in the pancreases of senp1 - deficient mice , consistent with that t1dm is an autoimmune disease in which insulin deficiency is a consequence of immunological destruction of the pancreatic beta cells123 .
pats secret cytokines the proinflammatory cytokines overproduction in early phase of disease could serve as a main reason for immunologic tolerance break and immune cell expansion in diabetes123 .
we found that the circulating proinflammatory cytokines il - 6 , tnf - alpha and il - ibeta , but not ifn - gamma , were significantly elevated in the senp1 - deficient mice before the onset of diabetes at the age of 7 weeks ( fig. 4a ) .
however , the levels of circulating cytokines might be too low to induce systemic autoimmune responses .
consistently , senp1 - deficient mice had normal cardiac function and vascular reactivity .
these mice exhibit increased systemic cytokines and cardiac myocarditis at the age of 14 weeks or older , indicating a prevalence of diabetic phenotype in the senp1 - deficient mice .
adipose tissue has been recognized as the largest endocrine organ and produces a large amount of cytokines5 .
we reasoned that pats might express high levels of cytokines to induce local ( pancreas ) inflammatory responses and diabetic phenotype in senp1 - deficient mice .
indeed , pats from senp1 - ap2ko mice expressed high levels of il - 6 , tnf - alpha and il - 1beta at the age of 7 weeks ( fig. 4b ; supplementary fig. 4a ) .
we also compared cytokine transcripts expressed in the adipocytes from pats , subcutaneous ( inguinal ) and gonadal and peri - renal adipose tissues at the age of 7 weeks .
ctrl mice expressed little basal cytokines in all adipose tissues .
we did not observe significant differences for senp1 deletion in different adipose depots .
however , senp1 deletion strongly enhanced gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the pats compared with other adipose depots ( fig. 4c ) .
to exclude the impact of macrophages or t cells affects the cytokine concentration , we examined immune cell numbers and cell - type - specific cytokine expression in the pancreas and pats .
we did not detect significant differences in cell numbers of macrophages and t cells in pats ( fig. 4d ) or pancreas of ctrl and senp1 - ap2ko mice at the age of 7 weeks .
moreover , expression levels of il - 6 , tnf - alpha and il - 1beta by isolated pancreatic t cells and macrophages were > 10 - fold lower than isolated pat adipocytes as measured by elisa ( fig. 4e ) .
similar results were obtained from measuring intracellular cytokine levels in adipocytes , t cells and macrophages within pats by facs on intracellular staining of single cells ( supplementary fig. 4b ) , suggesting that peri - pancreatic adipocytes primarily contribute to cytokine production in senp1 - ap2ko mice before the onset of diabetes. of note , we detected macrophages infiltration into the pancreases of senp1 - ap2ko mice at later phases ( 14 weeks ) , and these macrophages expressed high levels of proinflammatory cytokines ( supplementary fig. 4c - d ) .
we reasoned that the local high concentrations of cytokines might induce chemokine expression in adjacent pancreatic islets to recruit immune cells .
it is known that ccl5 ( rantes , the ccr5 ligand ) can direct recruitment of immune cells to inflammation sites or to autoimmune targets that may contribute to type - 1 diabetic development37 .
we analysed gene expression of chemokines that had been reported to be expressed in the pancreas .
we found that ccl5 was strongly upregulated in the pancreatic islets of senp1 - ap2ko mice at the age of 7 weeks before disease the onset .
ccl2 , ccl21 , cxcl19 and cxcl10 were weakly upregulated in pancreatic islets of senp1 - ap2ko mice ( fig. 4f ) .
expression of ccl5 in islet beta cells was confirmed by co - staining of ccl5 with insulin ( fig. 4g ) .
however , upregulation of ccl5 was not detected in other tissues of senp1 - ap2ko mice at the age of 7 weeks ( supplementary fig. 4e ) , suggesting a specific effect of pat - derived cytokines on adjacent islets .
this is consistent with human protein expression database that ccl5 is only detected in pancreas but not in other tissues except blood and immune cells ( genecards ; http :// www.genecards.org / cgi - bin / carddisp.pl ? gene = ccl5 ) .
we then directly tested whether proinflammatory cytokines secreted from pats could induce ccl5 expression in isolated islets .
ccl5 mrna in islets was significantly upregulated by conditional media of senp1 - ap2ko pancreatic adipocytes , and this upregulation was reduced by a neutralizing antibody to il - 6 , tnf or il - 1beta , and blunted by a combination of the three antibodies ( fig. 4h ) .
these data suggest that high levels of local proinflammatory cytokines secreted from pats induces ccl5 expression in islets , which in turn recruits immune cells into pancreas , causing damages of beta cells .
we also tested a direct effect of adipocyte - derived cytokines on the pancreatic islets .
to this end , isolated normal mouse pancreatic islets were incubated with culture supernatant of adipocytes from ctrl or senp1 - ap2ko , and islet structure and apoptosis were monitored by live / dead viability / cytotoxicity assays .
we found that culture supernatant from adipocytes of senp1 - ap2ko strongly induced beta - cell death and pancreatic disruption ( fig. 4i,j ) , suggesting that cytokines from peri - pancreatic adipocytes of senp1 - ap2ko mice have direct cytotoxic effects on pancreatic islet .
taken together , these results indicate that high local concentrations of cytokines derived from pats not only upregulate ccl5 expression and ccl5 - mediated infiltration of immune cells in pancreas but also directly induce cytotoxic damages on pancreatic islets .
senp1 deletion augments nf - kappab dependent inflammation it has been proposed that adipose tissue depots originate from distinct precursor cells are functionally diverse , and modulate disease processes in a depot - specific manner3839 .
we observed that peri - pancreatic adipocytes from senp1 - ap2ko exhibit 1.8 - fold smaller cell sizes ( fig. 5a,b ) with two - to three folds more cell numbers than the ctrl adipocytes ( supplementary fig. 5a - b ) .
moreover , peri - pancreatic adipocytes from senp1 - ap2ko mice expressed reduced differentiation markers including fatty acid synthase , adipose triglyceride lipase and lipoprotein lipase ( fig. 5c ) .
in contrast , gonadal and subcutaneous inguinal adipocytes in senp1 - ap2ko mice exhibited a much weaker phenotype ; they showed a smaller size at old ages ( 14 weeks ) without significant increases in cell numbers ; these phenotypes likely contribute to the reduced fat pad weight ( supplementary fig. 5c - h ) and total body weight of senp1 - ap2ko mice ( fig. 2 ) .
similar results were obtained in senp1 - adipoqko and senp1 - pdgfrko mice .
these data are consistent with the notion that a reduced state of adipocyte differentiation correlates with enhanced proinflammatory phenotype in some adipose depots383940 .
peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( ppargamma ) is not only the master regulator of adipogenesis but also plays a critical role in repressing inflammatory responses in a sumoylation - dependent manner1241 .
therefore , we first examined whether ppargamma was a senp1 target in adipocytes .
we found that expression of total ppargamma mrna and protein levels were similar in ctrl and senp1 - deficient adipocytes ( supplementary fig. 5i,j ) .
although ppargamma was sumoylated in both ctrl and senp1 - null adipocytes , no significant difference was detected between ctrl and senp1 - deficient cells ( supplementary fig. 5k,l ) .
these results suggest that sumoylation of ppargamma may not contribute to the reduced adipogenesis and enhanced cytokine production in pats of senp1 - deficient mice .
nf - kappab is a critical activator of genes for inflammation and immune regulation42 .
we observed that phosphorylations of ikk , ikappabalpha and nf - kappab subunit p65 / rela were increased with concomitant reduction of total ikappabalpha in the adipose tissues of senp1 - ap2ko mice .
in contrast , phosphorylation and total levels of erk1 / 2 in adipose tissues were not affected by senp1 deletion ( fig. 5d ) .
nf - kappab was further determined by intracellular staining for phosphor - p65 / rela in pat sections .
we observed phosphor - p65 / rela positive staining in the pat , but not in the pancreas ( fig. 5e ) .
the phosphor - p65 / rela was much stronger in senp1 - ap2ko adipocytes , marked by adipocyte - specific marker fabp4 ( fig. 5f,g ) .
however , phosphor - p65 / rela was not localized with a macrophage marker f4 / 80 ( fig. 5h ) .
we further performed p65 / rela chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) assays in ctrl and senp1 - deficient cells isolated from ctrl and senp1 - ap2ko mice .
we observed increased p65 / rela bindings to the il - 6 , il - 1beta and tnf - alpha promoters in senp1 - ap2ko adipocytes ( fig. 5i,j ) .
to directly test whether senp1 deficiency regulates the nf - kappab activation and cytokine production in adipocytes in vitro , 3t3 - l1 preadipocytes were first differentiated into the mature adipocytes and then transfected with a ctrl or senp1 short interfering rna ( sirna ) .
in the adipocytes with the senp1 knockdown , phosphorylated ikk , ikappabalpha and nf - kappab p65 / rela levels were increased markedly ( fig. 5k ) .
the gene expressions of proinflammatory cytokines ( il - 6 , tnf - alpha and il - 1 beta , but not ifn - gamma ) from adipocytes were significantly higher in senp1 knockdown cells ( fig. 5l ) , which concurs with our observations in senp1 - adipoqko and senp1 - ap2ko mice , as well as in adipocytes isolated from these mice .
conversely , overexpression of senp1 into senp1 - deficient adipocytes markedly decreased phospho - p65 / rela and cytokine productions .
taken together , our results suggest that senp1 directly regulates the activation of nf - kappab and cytokine production in adipocytes .
senp1 deletion augments nemo sumoylation in adipocytes of the nf - kappab components , sumoylation of ikk subunit nemo and nf - kappab p65 / rela are thought to be critical events for the activation of ikk - nf - kappab signalling9104344 .
senp2 can efficiently desumoylate nemo to blunt nf - kappab activation in a 293t overexpression system45 and senp1 was proposed to have a similar role46 .
to determine the role of senp1 in pancreatic proinflammatory phenotype and nf - kappab regulation , we first examined expression of senps in pats .
the senps can be divided into three families .
the first family members senp1 and senp2 have broad specificity for the three mammalian sumos ( sumo1 - 3 ) , while the second family ( senp3 and senp5 ) and the third family ( senp6 and senp7 ) prefer sumo2 / 3 as substrates14 .
we found that senp1 , but not senp2 , was abundantly expressed in mouse adipose tissues .
deletion of senp1 had no effects on expression of other senps ( supplementary fig. 6 ) .
sumoylations of nemo and p65 / rela were determined by co - immunoprecipitation from the denaturing adipocyte extracts with specific antibodies followed by western blotting with anti - sumo1 .
no difference in p65 / rela was detected between ctrl and senp1 - ap2ko mice ( fig. 6a ) .
however , an extra band appeared ~ 70 kda in the senp1 - ap2ko adipocyte extracts for nemo ( fig. 6b ) .
increased nemo sumoylation in senp1 - ko adipocyte was further confirmed by overexpression of flag - nemo ( fig. 6c ) .
it is reported that nemo sumoylation and ikk activation are enhanced by stress responses such as oxidative stress , inflammatory stimuli and dna damage in different cell types947 .
we observed that dna damage agent etoposide vp16 induced phosphorylation of ikk and p65 / rela in adipocytes , and senp1 deletion enhanced both basal and stress - induced ikk and p65 / rela activation ( fig. 6d ) .
senp1 deletion also enhanced both basal and stress - induced nemo sumoylation in adipocytes as detected by co - immunoprecipitation with anti - nemo followed by immunoblotting with anti - sumo1 ( fig. 6e ) .
it has been reported that nemo can be sumoylated at k277 and k309 ( ref. 9 ) .
to determine the functional importance of sumo modifications in regulating nf - kappab signalling in adipocytes , a single ( k277r or k309r ) and double lysine to arginine mutants ( dm ) were constructed as flag - nemo .
wild type ( wt ) or mutant flag - nemo was then was expressed in peri - pancreatic adipocytes isolated from senp1 - ap2ko mice , and the exogenous nemo versus endogenous nemo was about 1:1 ratio ( fig. 6f ) .
while phosphorylation of nf - kappab p65 / rela was slightly increased by nemo - wt , it was mildly decreased by nemo k277r and strongly decreased by nemo k309r or the double mutant as detected by immunoblotting ( fig. 6f ) and intracellular staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) - conjugated p - p65 / rela ( fig. 6g,h ) .
these data suggest that sumo - deficient nemo mutants ( nemo k309r and nemo - dm ) function as dominant negative forms .
nf - kappab - dependent cytokine expression was then determined by elisa in the nemo - transfected cells .
nemo mutants had similar effects on the protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines in adipocytes ( fig. 6i ) , supporting that sumoylated nemo enhances cytokine expression .
clinical relevance of adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice to determine whether our studies from the adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice have clinical relevance , we first investigated whether there is a correlation between senp1 expression in adipocytes of non - obese diabetic ( nod ) mice and human t1dm patients .
the nod mouse , a popularly used model for t1dm , developed diabetes with a late onset at the age of 14 weeks48 .
consistent with reports , we observed the incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the nod mouse was 60 - 80 % in females and 20 - 30 % in males ( fig. 7a ) .
mouse strains with an adipocyte - specific deletion of senp1 appeared more severe in hyperglycaemia and islet disruption compared with nod mice at the same age ( fig. 7b versus fig. 3a ; supplementary fig. 2 ) .
importantly , we observed an age - dependent reduction of senp1 expression in pats of nod mice ( fig. 7c ) , correlating with the t1dm progression in nod mice .
we next investigated a correlation between senp1 expression and proinflammatory cytokines in nod model and human t1dm patients .
to this end , venous blood was drawn from consenting volunteers ( healthy and diabetic subjects ; supplementary table 1 ) .
plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in t1dm patients compared with the normal cohorts ( fig. 7d ) .
the levels of cytokines from senp1 - ap2ko at the age of 12 weeks are at similar ranges as human serum with t1dm .
nod develops diabetes as a result of th1 dominant ifn - gamma - induced insulitis and leukocyte infiltrations of the pancreatic islets48 .
consistently , nod mice exhibit increased plasma ifn - gamma with lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared with senp1 - ap2ko mice and serum from human t1dm patients ( fig. 7e versus fig. 7d ) .
we then tested whether serum could directly induce beta - cell death and pancreatic disruption .
to this end , isolated normal mouse pancreatic islets were cultured with serum collected from ctrl , senp1 - ap2ko and nod mice , or collected from normal human and t1dm patients .
islet structure and apoptosis was monitored by live / dead viability / cytotoxicity assays .
serum from senp1 - ap2ko mice , nod mice and human t1dm all induced disruption and pancreatic cell death ( fig. 7f,g ) .
taken together , our results support that senp1 - ap2ko mice is a clinically relevant model for human diabetes .
we also tested whether insulin could prevent or delay t1dm progression in senp1 - ap2ko mice .
since t1dm is an islet - reactive t - cell - mediated autoimmune disease and insulin and its precursor ( pre ) proinsulin are major targets of islet - reactive t cells , both in humans and in nod mice49 .
it has been hypothesized that that repeated subcutaneous insulin administration prevents disease by acting as a vaccination protocol potentially restoring immune tolerance50 .
recent data suggest that short - term subcutaneous insulin administration delays but does not prevent diabetes in nod mice , likely by inducing a state of ' beta - cell rest ' that would make beta cells less vulnerable to metabolic stress , apoptosis and possibly to immune - mediated destruction4951 .
our results indicated that prophylactic insulin therapy in senp1 - deficient mice at the age of 5 weeks for 9 weeks only partially ameliorates development of diabetes phenotypes including immune cell infiltration , beta - cell apoptosis and islet disruptions ( supplementary fig. 7a - f ) .
nf - kappab inhibitors ameliorate diabetes progression to establish a causative link between senp1 - dependent nf - kappab activation and type 1 diabetes , senp1 - ap2ko mice were treated at the age of 5 weeks with intraperitoneal injection of nf - kappab activation inhibitor ii jsh - 23 ( 2 mg kg - 1 in 10 % dimethylsulphoxide ( dmso ) diluted with pbs ) twice a week for 6 weeks .
jsh - 23 had no effects on body weight , blood glucose and lipid profile in the ctrl mice .
however , administration of jsh - 23 in senp1 - ap2ko mice diminished senp1 deletion - induced elevation of blood glucose ( fig. 8a ) and reduction of insulin levels in blood ( fig. 8b ) concomitant with attenuated islet damages ( fig. 8c ) .
these normalized phenotypes in jsh - 23 - treated senp1 - ap2ko mice correlated with basal levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the pats of these mice ( fig. 8d ) .
no ccl5 expression in islets ( fig. 8e,f ) and apoptotic beta - cells ( fig. 8g ) were detected in the jsh - 23 - treated group .
these results support a critical role of senp1 - dependent nf - kappab activity in t1dm progression in senp1 - ap2ko mice .
hfd augments diabetic phenotype in senp1 deficient mice to determine the role of the senp1 - nemo - nf - kappab - pathway in adipocyte inflammation and its link to both t1dm and t2dm , we have examined the phenotype of senp1 - ap2ko mice under high - fat diet ( hfd ) conditions .
hfd increased fat weight in all adipose depots including epididymal fat and pats in ctrl and senp1 - ap2ko mice ( fig. 9a,b ) .
pats from senp1 - ap2ko exhibit 1.8 - fold smaller cell sizes with 2 - 3 - fold more cell numbers than the ctrl adipocytes under normal chow and this phenotype was more marked under hfd ( fig. 9c ) , suggesting that hfd may stimulate adipogenesis in pats of senp1 - ap2ko .
pats from senp1 - ap2ko mice expressed high levels of il - 6 , tnf - alpha and il - 1beta at the age of 7 weeks before the onset of diabetes , and these proinflammatory cytokines were higher in the pats compared with other adipose depots ( fig. 4 ) .
hfd significantly augmented the cytokine production in pats ( fig. 9d ) and subsequent disruption of islet structures in senp1 - ap2ko ( fig. 9e ) .
consistently , hfd increased body weight ( fig. 9f ) and accelerated hyperglycaemia with an onset at the age of 8 weeks ( versus 12 weeks under chow ) in senp1 - ap2ko mice ( fig. 9g ) .
basal and glucose - stimulated insulin levels were significantly reduced in senp1 - ap2ko mice .
moreover , hfd caused further reduction of insulin levels in senp1 - ap2ko mice , but not in ctrl mice ( fig. 9h - j ) .
although similar insulin responses were observed between senp1 - deficient mice and ctrl under standard chow in the itt assay , hfd significantly induced insulin resistance in ctrl mice and more severe phenotype was observed in senp1 - ap2ko mice ( fig. 9k,l ) .
moreover , liver insulin resistance , a hallmark of obesity - linked t2dm development , was detected under basal but more pronounced under hfd conditions in senp1 knockout ( ko ) mice ( fig. 9m,n ) .
taken together , our data demonstrate that hfd augments both t1dm and t2dm phenotypes in senp1 - ap2ko mice .
discussion in the present study , we have employed three different adipocyte - specific cre deleter lines ( adipoq - cre , pdgfralpha - cre and ap2 / fabp4 - cre ) and demonstrated that adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice gradually develop a t1dm phenotype , including hyperglycaemia , reduced insulin secretion , glucose intolerance and weight loss .
the adipocyte - specific senp1 deletion induces nf - kappab activation and nf - kappab - dependent proinflammatory cytokine production in the pats .
these cytokines induce high levels of ccl5 expression in adjacent islets to recruit ccr5 + immune cells .
subsequently , the cytokines and activated immune cells , especially cd8 + and cd4 + t cells , attack the pancreases , leading to the chronic destruction of the islet structures , damaged beta cells , autoantibody onset and diabetes progression in the senp1 - deficient mice ( fig. 10 ) .
local and circulating proinflammatory cytokines may serve as a mechanism to break self - tolerance and augment cytotoxic immune response in pancreases islets , contributing to the onset of t1dm .
the nod mouse is a popularly used model for t1dm and develops diabetes as a result of th1 dominant ifn - gamma - induced insulitis and leukocytic infiltrations of the pancreatic islets48 .
therefore , th1 and ifn - gamma play the key role in the disease onset in nod mice , which can capture some characteristics of human t1dm , but not the whole disease progression processes .
our adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice recapitulate the evolution process of t1dm from preclinical stage to later phase of t1dm , and therefore may provide a unique model for human t1dm .
unlike nod mice , both male and female senp1 - deficient mice exhibit similar diabetic phenotype .
it is worthy to mention that adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice exhibit normal lipid profiles in total cholesterol , low - density lipoprotein , hdl , tg and ffa upto the age of 14 weeks , suggesting that inflammation , but not lipotoxicity52 , induced beta - cell damages contribute to diabetic phenotype in senp1 - ap2ko mice. of note , peri - pancreatic adipocytes from senp1 - deficient mice exhibit reduced differentiation markers with a heightened proinflammatory state compared with other tissues , supporting the profound diabetic phenotype in these mice .
mechanistic studies suggest that senp1 deletion in adipocytes causes nf - kappab activation and nf - kappab - dependent cytokine expression .
the high sumoylation of the nf - kappab component nemo at lysines - 277 / 309 is the key factor in inducing nf - kappab activation and cytokine expression in senp1 - deficient adipocytes .
importantly , nf - kappab inhibitors ameliorate diabetes progression .
our data support that senp1 - mediated nemo desumoylation in the peri - pancreatic adipocytes limits inflammatory responses and diabetes progression .
it is conceivable that nemo sumoylation and nf - kappab activation in pats is more susceptible to alterations of senp1 expression / activity versus other adipose depots .
alternatively , pancreas and pancreatic beta - cells are more sensitive to local and systemic cytokine - mediated immune responses .
it has been reported that ap2 - cre deletion is floxed gene loci specific23 .
the majority of studies have reported highly adipocyte - specific recombination of the ap2 / fabp4 promoter - driven cre strain ( ap2 - crebi ) 24252653 .
a couple of reports have shown variable degrees of target gene recombination in macrophages2754 .
a recent study suggested that the ap2 - cre induces recombination in the capillary endothelium in the heart and in intermyofibrillar cells in the skeletal muscle , but not in macrophages in adipose tissue23 .
interestingly , they have found that different floxed gene loci display differential sensitivity to cre - mediated recombination and that different adipose depots recombine to different extents .
therefore , it is necessary that one should carefully examine the specific gene deletion in their study .
we did not detect significant differences in senp1 expression in brain , muscle and liver tissues between wt and senp1 - ap2ko mice .
therefore , the deletion of senp1 was limited to the adipose tissues in the senp1 - ap2ko mice .
our results are consistent with a recent report55. with the same ap2 - cre strain as in our study , the authors have shown that ap2 - cre expression is highly specific for adipocytes , and they found no cre - mediated target gene recombination in muscle , liver , brain , adipose stromal vascular cells or adipose macrophages .
a novel mechanistic insight from our study is the ability of senp1 to control nf - kappab - dependent proinflammatory cytokine secretion in adipocytes .
it has been shown that only senp2 , but not other senps , can efficiently desumoylate nemo and enhance nf - kappab activation induced by dna damage in a hek 293t overexpression system45 .
our data indicate that senp1 expression is sixfold higher than senp2 in mouse adipose tissues .
moreover , our studies using sirna knockdown , senp1 - ko adipocytes and reconstitutions of senp1 into senp1 - ko cells clearly demonstrate that senp1 , by desumoylating nemo at k277 and k309 , plays a pivotal role in regulating nf - kappab activation and cytokine production in adipocytes .
given that senp1 and senp2 are two members of senps with broad specificity for sumos1415 , it is conceivable that senp1 and senp2 regulate nemo sumoylation and nf - kappab activation in different tissues and / or cell types .
our data is in line with the report that components in sumoylation are associated with t1dm susceptibility .
interestingly , a variant of sumo4 ( m55v ) strongly associated with t1dm results in 5.5 times greater nf - kappab transcriptional activity by conjugating to nf - kappab inhibitor ikappabalpha1819 .
although a genetic mutation of senp1 has not been identified thus far , our study suggests that reduced senp1 expression and enhanced nf - kappab activity in adipose tissues may represent a common mechanism for the role of sumoylayion in the pathogenesis of t1dm. of clinical significance of our current work , we observe an age - dependent reduction of senp1 expression in pats of the diabetic nod mice , correlating with the diabetic progression in these mice .
typical features of human t1dm include hyperglycaemia , cytotoxic effector cell - mediated attack on beta cell , beta - cell death and generation of autoantibodies123 .
these phenotypes are evidently observed in the adipocyte - specific senp1 - deficient mice , suggesting that senp1 in adipocytes plays a pivotal role in preventing autoimmune diabetes .
although previous research focuses on lipid metabolism in the adipocytes , it is now recognized that adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ that could play an important role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines , such as il - 1beta , il - 6 and tnf - alpha , to regulate immune responses556 .
our data demonstrate that t1dm onset in the senp1 - deficient mice is strongly associated with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by pats , underlying a mechanistic link between peri - pancreatic adipocytes and diabetes .
first , proinflammatory cytokines have direct effects on islet immunogenicity and islet beta - cell survival .
we show that the high concentrations of pat - derived cytokines directly induce expression of ccl5 and other chemokines ( such as ccl2 , ccl21 , cxcl9 and cxcl10 ) in adjacent pancreatic islets , chemokines responsible for recruitment of immune cells .
it needs to further investigate if and how ccl5 and other chemokines directly contribute to t1dm progression .
the inflammatory cytokines have direct cytotoxic effects on islet beta cells .
second , proinflammatory cytokines have direct effects on various immune cell types , specifically t cells .
these immune cells further release more innate inflammatory cytokines , which damage beta cells and break tolerance through activation of adaptive responses .
indeed , we observe that th1 and th17 effector t - cell subsets expanded in senp1 - deficient mice .
third , proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic t cells triggers beta - cell turnover257 , resulting in the release of autoantigens and endogenous ' danger signals' capable of promoting pathologic self - antigen presentation58 .
we observe massive apoptosis of beta cells in our mouse model , accompanying with infiltrations of cd8 + and cd4 + t cells .
indeed , we detect iaa in the senp1 - ap2ko mice at old ages , indicative of autoimmune disease t1dm in these mice .
a reduced number of foxp3 + regulatory t cells are also observed in senp1 - deficient mice .
moreover , islet - specific autoimmune nrp - v7 - positive cd8 + t cells could be detected in the pancreatic lymph nodes and the spleen of senp1 - deficient mice .
taken together , our study provides a strong mechanistic link between adipose - secreted proinflammatory cytokines and t1dm .
it will be important to test whether blockade of proinflammatory cytokines or blockade of cytotoxic t cells could block t1dm pathogenesis development in the senp1 - deficient mouse model .
it worth mentioning that type - 1 and type - 2 diabetes are systemically linked .
specifically , the accumulation of activated innate immune cells in metabolic tissues results in release of inflammatory mediators , in particular , il - 1beta and tnf - alpha , which promote systemic insulin resistance and beta - cell damage6 .
our data demonstrate that senp1 - ap2ko mice have strong t1dm phenotypes concomitant with mild t2dm , which can be exacerbated by hfd .
specifically , hfd augments pat morphological change , cytokine production and pancreatic damage in senp1 - ap2ko mice , and hfd augments hyperglycaemia and insulin reduction in senp1 - ap2ko mice .
moreover , a moderate insulin resistance in the liver of senp1 - deficient mice is observed under standard chow .
however , hfd augments liver insulin resistance , a hallmark of obesity - linked t2dm development , in senp1 - ap2ko mice .
taken together , our data demonstrate that the increased cytokines in senp1 - ap2ko mice contribute not only to t1dm progression but also to hfd - induced t2dm phenotypes in these mice .
in summary , our experiments define the role of the senp1 - mediated protein sumoylation in pancreatic immune responses , beta - cell damages and consequently diabetes progression .
our study has provided a molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of diabetes , and may help to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes .

rescue of diabetic phenotype by nf - kappab inhibitor nf - kappab activation inhibitor ii jsh - 23 is an inhibitor of nf - kappab transcriptional activity ( half - maximal inhibitory concentration = 7.1 mum ) by inhibiting the mechanism of transcription , without affecting the process of ikappabalpha degradation .

figure 10 a model for the role of senp1 in t1dm .
senp1 keeps nf - kappab and inflammation in quiescent in adipose tissues .
here we show that adipocyte - specific senp1 deletion induces nemo sumoylation , nf - kappab activation and nf - kappab - dependent proinflammatory cytokine production in adipose tissues , profoundly in the peri - pancreatic adipose tissue ( pat ) .
these cytokines induce high levels of chemokine ccl5 expression in adjacent islets to recruit ccr5 + immune cells .
subsequently , the cytokines and activated immune cells , especially cd8 + and cd4 + t cells , attack the pancreases , leading to the chronic destruction of the islet structures , damaged beta cells , autoantibody onset and type - 1 diabetes progression in the senp1 - deficient mice .
therefore , nf - kappab inhibitors block inflammation and ameliorate diabetes progression in the senp1 - deficient mice .
senp1 expression in pats of the diabetic nod mice is reduced in an age - dependent manner , correlating with the diabetic progression in these mice .
our current study demonstrates that reduced senp1 expression and enhanced nf - kappab activity in pats may represent a common mechanism for the role of protein sumoylayion in the pathogenesis of t1dm .

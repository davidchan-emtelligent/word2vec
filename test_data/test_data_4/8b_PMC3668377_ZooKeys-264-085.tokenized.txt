the type locality of gortyna intermedia barnes & benjamin is restricted to lundbreck , municipality of crowsnest pass , alberta , canada .
keywords canada united states alaska co1 mitochondrial dna barcodes introduction a website devoted to the macromoths ( excluding the geometridae ) of the pacific northwest was recently created by a team that includes the authors of the current paper .
the pacific northwest ( pnw ) is defined as all of idaho , oregon , and washington and the western part of montana in the united states and all of british columbia in canada .
this site , called pacific northwest moths ( http :// pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu / ) , has been available to the public since july 2012 .
the internet format - as opposed to a book or journal article - lends itself to continuous updating of things such as additional species , range extensions and life histories .
however , it is not an appropriate format for taxonomic work intended for a larger audience , nor does it satisfy the requirements for the description of new taxa .
we are aware of several undescribed species of erebidae and noctuidae in the pacific northwest ( pnw ) .
three of these are described here so that they can be included on the website .
the thorough vetting of pnw moth collections that was part of the website work confirmed that three superficially distinctive populations of previously named moths are isolated segregates .
these are sufficiently different to warrant recognition as subspecies , a taxonomic category that we reserve for populations that are both geographically isolated and differ significantly in appearance from other populations of their species .
three subspecies are named in this paper .
one of the new pnw species is in the genus resapamea varga & ronkay ( noctuidae ) .
this presents an opportunity to name two additional species in this genus even though they are from parts of western north america outside the pnw .
a large number of taxonomic changes in the superfamily noctuoidea have recently been advanced in a new check list for north america north of mexico ( lafontaine and schmidt 2010 ) and in the first update to this list ( lafontaine and schmidt 2011 ) .
additional synonyms to those published by these authors were discovered during the website work , usually because a pnw species is known by more than one name .
the new synonyms that are discussed in this paper are in the genera chytolita grote ( erebidae ) and hydraecia guenee ( noctuidae ) .
the genus hydraecia is represented by hydraecia perobliqua hampson and the hydraecia obliqua species - group in the pnw .
the number of species in the latter group is confusing to collectors , with seemingly more names than species .
an attempt by the senior author to revise it in the late 1990s was never published because of difficulties in assigning species boundaries using standard morphological methods .
more recent dna data allows many of these issues to be resolved .
the pnw species hydraecia obliqua ( harvey ) and hydraecia medialis smith are discussed and illustrated herein , and the type locality of the third north american species in the species - group , hydraecia intermedia ( barnes & benjamin ) , is restricted .
this paper is arranged in check list order following lafontaine and schmidt ( 2010 ) .
materials and methods genitalia were prepared using standard methods for inflating the male vesica and female bursa ( lafontaine 2004 ) .
terminology for wing markings and anatomy also follows lafontaine ( op. cit. ) except in drasteria hubner ( erebidae ) where they are modified from metlevski and zolnerowich ( 2009 ) .
the term ductus bursae is used herein for the entire length of the tube connecting the ostium bursae to the corpus bursae .
metlevski and zolnerowich ( op. cit. ) divide this structure into two parts - the ductus bursae and antrum - restricting the use of ductus bursae to the anterior sclerotized portion .
in resapamea , a stout process extending dorsad from the base of the sacculus is herein named the basal saccular process .
this structure was called the clavus by zilli et al .
( 2005 ) , a term that is potentially confusing because the term clavus has been used previously for a rod - like sensory organ with apical setae located adjacent to the base of the valve in some noctuid genera ( forbes 1954 , lafontaine 2004 ) .
the sequence of the 658 base pair " barcode " region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 ( hereafter called co1 or barcode ) were obtained from the barcodes of life initiative through the courtesy of dr. j. donald lafontaine .
only pre - existing data were used during this study .
the barcode sequences were compared using phylograms constructed using the kimura - 2 - parameter distance model as implemented on the bold systems website ( ratnasingham and hebert 2007 ) .

distribution and biology .
this subspecies is restricted to gravel prairies south of puget sound , washington .
these prairies were created by the outwash from the vashon lobe of the pleistocene glaciation , and might have been maintained as open prairies by burning by native humans to promote the growth of camas lilies ( camassia spp. , liliaceae ) as a food source .
the moth is associated with dogbane ( apocynum spp. , apocynaceae ) , the known foodplant of camassia oregonensis elsewhere in north america ( tietz 1972 ) .
this is almost certainly the larval foodplant of camassia oregonensis tristis , although this has not been confirmed .
this moth flies during june and july. remarks .
cycnia oregonensis is found in a large part of north america , occurring from coast to coast and from the border with mexico north to central saskatchewan and nova scotia ( covell 1984 , ferguson et al. 2000 ) .
this range includes much of the pnw , including western oregon and the area east of the cascade range as far north as south - central british columbia .
throughout most of its range it is nearly uniform in color and pattern .
cycnia oregonensis tristis is limited to a small area near olympia , washington and is the only known population of this species in washington west of the cascades .
it is distinctly grayer and less patterned than all other populations , but has an identical co1 barcode sequence .
the type specimen of euchaetes oregonensis stretch was collected by lord walsingham on a trip through oregon during 1871 - 1872 ( stretch 1872 - [ 1874 ]) .
comparison of his itinerary ( essig 1941 ) with the flight period of the moth suggests strongly that it was collected in the southwestern corner of the state between roseburg and the california border .
cycnia oregonensis tristis is separated from the closest west - side populations in western oregon by 225 kilometers .
all of the specimens of camassia oregonensis oregonensis examined from near the likely type locality are similar to those from elsewhere in north america .
the puget prairies where camassia oregonensis tristis flies are inhabited by several other distinctive lepidoptera with limited distributions , including the noctuid moth apamea inordinata olympia crabo and several uncommon butterflies .

two species of chytolita grote have until now been recognized for north america ( lafontaine and schmidt 2010 ) : chytolita morbidalis ( guenee ) and chytolita petrealis grote .
both species names have at various times been used for material collected in the pnw ; however , only a single species with slight variation in size and darkness exists in this region .
material from eastern north america , the type specimens of the available names , and material previously submitted for co1 sequencing were therefore examined to attempt to elucidate the correct name for the pnw species .
it was found that there is virtually no variation in barcodes in this genus despite the fact that the sample is diverse and includes larger light - colored specimens identified as chytolita morbidalis and smaller dark ones submitted as chytolita petrealis from a large portion of eastern north america .
the two previously recognized species have been described as " identical in pattern " ( forbes 1954 ) and were only distinguished by size and darkness without structural differences .
the dark small forms known as chytolita petrealis are from swamps and acid bogs ( forbes op. cit. ) and are consistent with an ecophenotype .
this evidence indicates that chytolita petrealis grote is a synonym of herminea morbidalis guenee .
the two syntypes of herminea morbidalis guenee could not be located and might be lost ; however , the original description is sufficient to identify the species and associate it with the genus chytolita based on features of the labial palpus and the presence of an accessory cell on the forewing .
a neotype designation is not necessary since there is only one chytolita species in north america .

the type series is restricted to oregon and washington. etymology .
the name refers to the parallel lines across the pale medial area of the forewing of this species .
this name perpetuates the geometry references of the related species drasteria divergens ( behr ) and drasteria convergens mustelin. diagnosis .
drasteria parallela is most closely related to drasteria convergens ( fig. 4 ) , a species that occurs to the south of its range in california as far north as mono county .
both have a medial line comprised of distinct parallel components , but the dorsal hindwing of drasteria convergens is light red rather than orange .
in the pacific northwest drasteria parallela is most likely to be confused with drasteria divergens ( fig. 5 ) , which is similar in size and has a similarly colored orange hindwing .
they can be distinguished without dissection by the pattern of the medial areas of both wings .
the forewing medial line of drasteria parallela is double with parallel component , whereas drasteria divergens has a single broader medial line .
on the hindwing , the discal spot of drasteria parallela is nearly rectangular and the veins between it and the postmedial line are dark and contrasting .
the discal spot of drasteria divergens is joined broadly to the postmedial line giving it a long curved c - shape and the adjacent veins are orange .
they also differ in other features of the maculation , including a smoother subterminal line in drasteria parallela .
structurally , the valves of drasteria parallela and drasteria convergens ( fig. 34 ) can be distinguished from those of drasteria divergens by the nearly equal lengths of the two claspers and more rounded valvulae .
in drasteria divergens ( fig. 35 ) the right clasper is longer and more slender than the left and the posterodorsal valvulae are angular .
drasteria parallela has a relatively short and wide costal process of the right valve compared to that of drasteria convergens in which it is long and narrow .
in the vesica , the posteriorly - directed process arising from the glove - like diverticulum on the left side of the dorsal vesica is conical in drasteria parallela and conical with two small finger - like projections in drasteria convergens .
the female genitalia of drasteria parallela and drasteria convergens ( fig. 46 ) are told easily from those of drasteria divergens ( fig. 47 ) by their much shorter antevaginal plates , which are rectangular and over half the length of the ductus bursae in drasteria divergens , and by the presence of a narrow curved extensions of the pseudobursae that is absent in drasteria divergens .
the female genitalia of drasteria parallela differ from those of drasteria convergens by the size of the antrum of the ductus bursae , which is similar in length to the colliculus in drasteria parallela , but twice as long in drasteria convergens , and by the shape of the corpus bursae , which is rounded in drasteria parallela , but ovoid in drasteria convergens ( ratio of width : length 0.87 and 0.7 , respectively ). description .

basal , antemedial , and postmedial lines similar , wide , partially double , black with chestnut - brown filling ; basal line oblique from medial costa near wing base toward outer margin , fading at mid - wing ; antemedial line complete , convex toward outer margin , drawn strongly toward wing base on costa , mid - wing , and posterior margin ; postmedial line complex , costal origin near reniform spot , anterior portion strongly oblique toward outer margin to strong tooth on m1 , slightly concave between m1 and m3 , less strongly toothed on m3 and cua1 , then drawn strongly toward base and bending slightly anteriorly to posterior end of reniform spot , then bending sharply to meet posterior margin at a slight angle toward outer margin , portion posterior to reniform spot appearing to form a continuous line with medial margin of spot .
medial line dark gray , double , with nearly parallel components of equal strength across width of wing .
subterminal line double with dark brown to black inner and gray outer components , filled with tan , smooth with slight undulations , slightly offset toward base below the costa and convex toward outer margin elsewhere , preceded by a black line or series of black wedges or smudged marks between veins .

distribution and biology .
drasteria parallela is found in the cascade mountains of washington , the klamath and siskiyou mountains of southwestern oregon and northern california , and the northern sierra nevada in california .
it is most commonly collected on exposed ridges in forests at middle elevations .
it flies during july .
the early stages and foodplant are unknown .
barcodes suggest a close relationship of drasteria parallela and drasteria convergens to drasteria howlandii ( grote ) , which feeds on eriogonum michaux ( polygonaceae ) ( powell and opler 2009 ). remarks .
this species has until now been called drasteria convergens in the pnw .
the barcode of a single sample of this species from plumas county , california ( boldsystems sample id : cncnoctuoidea7767 ) differs by 1.3 % from that of drasteria convergens from mono county , california .

this glacial lake covered much of utah and southern idaho during the late pleistocene epoch .
the distribution of this moth is in the lake bonneville basin and along its historic flood path along the snake river. diagnosis .
no other pacific northwest noctuid is likely to be confused with this brightly colored moth .
eudryas brevipennis bonnevilleis superficially nearly identical to eudryas unio ( hubner ) ( fig. 8 ) , which occurs in eastern north america as far west as the eastern great plains and texas , but the genitalia of eudryas brevipennis bonneville are indistinguishable from those of eudryas brevipennis brevipennis stretch from california .

distribution and biology .
eudryas brevipennis bonnevilleoccurs near large rivers and lakes in the northern intermountain region .
most specimens have been collected near the snake river in south - central idaho .
the moth flies during late spring and summer and has been collected from late may through early august .
the early stages are unknown .
california populations of eudryas brevipennis feed on the willowherb epilobium ciliatum raf. and evening primroses ( oenothera spp . )
( comstock and dammers 1938 ) , all in the evening primrose family ( onagraceae ) .
it is likely that eudryas brevipennis bonneville utilizes similar plants in this family. remarks .
eudryas brevipennis , including the utah populations , is considered to be conspecific with eudrya unio by poole on the website nearctica.com .
these taxa differ in the structure of the genitalia of both sexes indicating that they are distinct species .
the identical male and female genitalia of the california and intermountain populations of eudryas brevipennis suggest strongly that they are the same species despite the differences in wing pattern and the 700 kilometer gap that separates them .
a single specimen from modesto , california in the cnc resembles subspecies bonneville more than other california populations .
eudryas should be sought in riparian habitats in the area between california and the range of eudryas brevipennis bonneville to see if this subspecies has a larger range than is known currently .
there is no barcode data for either subspecies of eudryas brevipennis .

the name is derived from the latin diluvium meaning deluge or flood .
the columbia basin where this moth occurs in washington was scoured repeatedly by cataclysmic floods at the end of the ice age. diagnosis .
resapamea diluvius is most likely to be confused with resapemea passer ( guenee ) ( figs 12 - 14 ) , a common and widespread moth in north america .
resapamea passer is found in the pacific northwest where it flies on both sides of the cascade mountains , including at the type locality of resapamea diluvius .
resapamea diluvius is less variable than resapamea passer , which comes in a range in colors and patterns that includes dark brown , reddish brown , dull light yellow brown , or a mixture of light - and dark - brown forms .
resapamea diluvius is dark hoary gray brown or red brown , grayer than resapamea passer on both wings , with a more streaky pattern distal to the cell due to pale - gray veins .
a few specimens of resapamea passer have streaky distal forewings , but this is due to dark veins against a lighter ground ( the veins of most resapamea passer are dark gray under magnification but do not contrast with the ground color ) .
most specimens of resapamea diluvius have the streaky pattern accentuated by black between the veins in the distal subterminal area and terminal area across the width of the wing .
in resapamea passer , black scaling on the distal wing is uncommon , and is usually limited to the area distal to the cell and in the fold .
finally , white or cream in the lateral reniform spot is typical in resapamea diluvius , whereas pale scales in the spot are variable in resapamea passer : absent , darker yellow or tan if limited to the lateral portion , or filling the entire spot .
habitat association with dunes and early flight period are also characteristic of resapamea diluvius , whereas resapamea passer is found in a variety of wetland and agricultural habitats and usually flies later in the summer with a peak during late june and july .
the male genitalia of resapamea diluvius are similar to those of resapamea passer ( fig. 39 ) .
the cucullus of the valve is more massive than that of resapamea passer , especially relative to the width of the valve , and the anal margin is more rounded .
in the vesicas , the diverticulum bearing a ridge of spines ( cock 's comb ) on the ventral surface is positioned slightly closer to the base in resapamea diluvius , is smaller in size , and has a less pronounced ridge of spines than in resapamea passer .
the female genitalia of these species are also similar .
the bursa copulatrix of resapamea diluvius is rounder than that of resapamea passer ( fig. 51 ) , with the ratio of length to width approximately 1.5 in resapamea diluvius and 1.75 in resapamea passer. description .

basal and antemedial lines similar , gray , faint and incomplete , partially double filled with ground or a slightly lighter shade thereof ; basal line evident as patches of gray scales on costa and near base of cubital line ; antemedial line usually evident as a faint gray spot on costa and a strongly zigzag gray line posterior to cubital vein .
medial line gray to dark gray , diffuse , gently excurved , variable in prominence from absent , a faint shade on mid - wing , or complete .
postmedial line double with consistent medial black component and variable absent to faint - gray lateral component , filled with a light shade of ground color , drawn sharply basad to level of mid - reniform spot on costa , smoothly excurved around reniform spot with lateral apex on r5 or m1 , then oblique and slightly concave toward base from near subterminal line to junction of basal two - thirds and distal third of posterior margin , very weakly toothed on veins except for a stronger tooth on 1a + 2a .

distribution and biology .
this species occurs in the columbia basin in washington and northern oregon .
specimens from dunes in northern nevada and the northern great plains have been examined but the limits of its distribution are not well known .
the early stages of resapamea diluvius are unknown .
the larvae most likely feed on rumex venosus pursh ( polygonaceae ) based on their close association with this plant in the columbia basin .
this rue is abundant on the dunes where resapamea diluvius occurs ( fig. 53 ) and the moth has not been found in columbia basin dune systems from which the plant is absent .
some other resapamea species such as resapamea passer are known to feed on rumex species ( tietz 1972 ) .
adults fly from late april to early june .
no specimens have been found at the type locality during summer or fall , although resapamea passer occurs there during the summer .
resapamea diluvius is local but is often abundant where it occurs. remarks .
the co1 sequences of resapamea diluvius and resapamea passer are nearly uniform within each species but differ from each other by over 3.5 % .
hadena hulstii grote , hadena morna strecker , and hadena virguncula smith are considered to be synonyms of mamestra passer guenee ( lafontaine and schmidt 2010 ) .
all were described from colorado .
the holotype of hadena hulstii could not be located and is presumed lost ( lafontaine jd pers. comm. 2012 ) .
the holotypes of the other two were examined ( hadena virguncula from a photograph ) to exclude the possibility that they refer to resapamea diluvius .

the name is derived from the type locality at angel lake , nevada. diagnosis .
resapamea angelika is a distinctive resapamea species due to the combination of large size , even dark red - brown forewing color , small or absent orbicular spot , and narrow reniform spot with well - demarcated thin black outline and prominent cream to light orange filling .
it is most likely to be confused with resapamea passer ( figs 12 - 14 ) and resapamea innota ( smith ) ( fig. 16 ) .
resapamea passer is variable , usually brown or mottled tan and brown , but is not dark red brown like resapamea angelika .
resapamea innota has red - brown or orange - brown forewings and could potentially be confused with resapamea angelika on this basis .
its orbicular spot is similar to the reniform spot , not very small or absent as in resapamea angelika , and the reniform spot is broader , lacks a black outline and is filled with uniform light ochre , unlike that of resapamea angelika .
the dorsal hindwing of resapamea innota is darker gray than in resapamea angelika .
resapamea angelika appears to be a significantly larger moth ( fw length 19 mm ) compared to resapamea innota ( fw length 14 - 17 mm ) . the male genitalia of resapamea angelika are similar to those of resapamea passer ( fig. 39 ) .
based on the holotype , resapamea angelika has a slightly broader distal uncus , a more v - shaped inferior juxta , and a larger and more angular basal saccular process .
in the vesica , the ridge of spines with a sclerotized base ( cock 's comb ) adorning a ventral diverticulum is smaller than in resapamea passer. description .

distribution and biology .
this species is only known from the vicinity of angel lake in the east humboldt range of northeastern nevada .
the habitat is sedge meadows along tributaries of angel creek .
these meadows appear to lack rumex but harbor dense stands of an iris ( iris spp. , iridaceae ) which might be the larval foodplant .
the early stages of resapamea angelika are unknown .
the few known specimens have been collected during late july and early august. remarks .
the co1 sequence of the female paratype differs from those of all other north american resapamea , including resapamea passer and resapamea innota,by over 3.4 % .
the holotypes of luperina innota smith , type locality wyoming , yellowstone park , and luperina enargia barnes & benjamin , type locality california , tulare county , monachee meadows , were examined from photographs to ensure that neither name is referable to resapamea angelika .
these specimens are superficially very similar to each other and may represent the same species .
somewhat variable resapamea populations resembling these types are found at mid - elevations in a large portion of the western united states and require further study to determine the number of species that are involved .
because of this , we feel that it is premature to consider resapamea innota and resapamea enargia to be synonyms .

the holotype was collected during early july .
the early stages are unknown. remarks .
two unidentified resapamea females in the cnc , one from unalakleet , alaska ( fig. 19 ) and the other from reindeer station , aklavik , northwest territories ( fig. 20 ) , resemble resapamea mammuthus and resapamea hedeni .
we exclude them from the type series of resapamea mammuthus because their identity is uncertain until either population can be associated with males or until females of the old crow population of resapamea mammuthus are found .
their superficial appearances suggest that the aklavik specimen is the female of resapamea mammuthus and that the unalakleet specimen is resapamea hedeni or a closely related species .

more than a decade ago , prior to the availability of mitochondrial dna , the senior author conducted a study of the genus hydraecia guenee focusing on the western north american species related to hydraecia obliqua ( harvey ) , herein referred to as the hydraecia obliqua species - group for convenience .
these moths occur over a large area spanning the pacific coast to the great plains west to east and british columbia , alberta , and saskatchewan to southern california , northeastern arizona , and northern new mexico north to south .
this study included examination of all primary types , assembling over 600 specimens from most large institutional and many private north american collections , and examination of over 60 genitalia preparations .
the conclusion was that hydraecia intermedia ( barnes & benjamin ) , known only from the holotype from fort calgary , is distinct but that all other populations in the species - group exhibit nearly continuous clinal variation in maculation and genitalia to form a circle of races ( rasenkranz ) from california , across montana , and ending in the montane forests of the southwest .
this work was accepted for publication but was withdrawn because of the author 's concern that somewhat distinctive populations on the pacific coast and in the southwest might be different species from the widespread intervening population but that the genitalia structure lacked differences sufficient for resolving the species .
since then , barcodes have demonstrated a consistent 2 % difference between populations from near the pacific coast ( northern california , washington , and british columbia ( n = 6 )) and those from farther inland ( colorado , washington , wyoming , alberta , and british columbia ( n = 7 )) that along with slight differences in maculation suggest that they are best treated as distinct species .
the western species is hydraecia obliqua and the eastern one is hydraecia medialis smith .
hydraecia obliqua occurs east to the sierra nevada in california and the crest of the cascade range in oregon and washington .
it occurs continuously on the coast north to southwestern british columbia , with a disjunct northern population at terrace , british columbia .
its forewing is warm orange brown , varying considerably in darkness from dark brown on the california coast ( fig. 21 ) , lighter orange brown in the pacific northwest ( figs 22 - 23 ) , and pale yellow brown in the sierra nevada .
the hindwing is pale with a yellow tint , usually with dark veins and a gray suffusion in the submarginal area .
the forewing pattern is similar to that of hydraecia medialis , especially where they approach each other in the pnw , with slight differences that are described under hydraecia medialis .
an area of possible intergradation between hydraecia obliqua and hydraecia medialis in oregon is discussed under hydraecia medialis .

type locality : [ usa ] , colorado .

type locality : [ canada ] , alberta , calgary. syn. n. remarks .
hydraecia medialis is the widespread and variable species that occurs east of the range of hydraecia obliqua .
it is similar to it in size and pattern but is duller gray brown in the pnw , ranging from very pale ( fig. 24 ) to darker gray brown ( figs 25 - 26 ) .
the forewing postmedial line tends to be more angled relative to the posterior margin than in hydraecia obliqua and usually lacks a slight bend in or near the fold that is found commonly in that species .
the hindwing ground color is variable , most commonly off - white , but lacks a yellow tint .
gray scaling on the hindwing varies from absent to covering the entire wing .
when present on the distal portion , it often forms a band to the outer margin , whereas in hydraecia obliqua gray shading usually leaves the outer edge of the wing pale .
specimens of hydraecia medialis from forests tend to be darker than those from open sage steppe habitats , especially in southern british columbia and western montana .
its northern limit in the pnw is at 100 mile house in south - central british columbia .
specimens of hydraecia medialis from the great plains are similar to those in the pnw but tend to be more uniform with dull gray - tan color , smooth lines , and less contrast between the antemedial and medial areas on the inner third of the forewing .
populations from the southern rocky mountains have a similar pattern to those from the great plains but are more colorful and variable , with gray or red - brown individuals and paler gray - white subterminal areas .
those from utah and arizona are red brown , darkest in arizona .
as mentioned under hydraecia obliqua , the barcodes of hydraecia obliqua and hydraecia medialis differ by 2 %. a third barcode haplotype differing from both of these by slightly more than 2 % exists for a single specimen of hydraecia medialis from wyoming ( boldsystems sample id : cncnoctuoidea6703 ) .
this specimen is superficially indistinguishable from two other wyoming specimens with barcodes that match those of other hydraecia medialis and this haplotype is therefore interpreted as a dna polymorphism rather than evidence of a cryptic species .
a discussion of hydraecia intermedia - known only from the holotype - is warranted in this section because its type locality of fort calgary suggests that it should be sympatric with hydraecia medialis near present - day calgary in southwestern alberta .
its forewing is warm yellow brown unlike those of hydraecia medialis , with markings that are more like those of hydraecia obliqua than hydraecia medialis .
structurally , its digitus is shorter and more bluntly rounded than those of all other populations in the hydraecia obliqua species - group ( n = 45 ) .
the following discussion regarding its type locality is contributed by b. c. schmidt : " hydraecia intermedia is an enigmatic taxon that has not been recorded near the stated type locality , nor anywhere else in alberta ( pohl et al .
2010 ) , since the collection of the type specimen about a century ago .
in barnes and mcdunnough 's ( 1924 ) original description , the type specimen data is given as " ft. calgary , n. w. brit .
columbia " and " viii , 16 " without a mention of year or collector .
virtually all of the moth specimens originating from the calgary area in the early 1900 's were collected by the well - known pioneer lepidopterist frederic hova wolley dod who resided in the foothills just west of calgary ( bird et al .
1995 ) , and who was the source of many moths named by j. b. smith ( todd 1982 ) .
however , dod 's specimens were never labelled as " ft. calgary " nor " n. w. brit .
columbia " - this convention appears to have been used solely by j. gamble geddes , who made extensive lepidoptera collections in south - western alberta during his visits in 1883 and 1884 ( geddes 1889 ) .
it is not clear why geddes referred to the region as north west british columbia , as the modern boundaries of british columbia were already established at that time , while southern alberta was known as the district of alberta and was part of the north west territories .
a subsequent note on his collecting again shows that he referred to the region as british columbia ( geddes 1889 ) , possibly because he considered the mountains and passes he visited to be part of b.c .
( the passes indeed straddling the alberta - b.c. boundary ) .
several butterflies ( lycaena dorcas florus w. h. edwards , colias elis strecker ) and moths collected by geddes during these trips were named as new species .
geddes' handwritten catalogue of butterflies in the cnc entomology library indicates that geddes collected butterflies in the crowsnest pass area in august of 1883 , and was collecting in the crowsnest pass proper on august 16th , corresponding to the " viii 16 " of the intermedia holotype .
as there was no direct rail line between the crowsnest pass and calgary , some 350 km distant , it is very unlikely that the intermedia type could have been collected on the same day in calgary , and it appears that geddes simply recorded the nearest major settlement before distributing the specimens and associated label data .
a week earlier , geddes collected the type specimens of lycaena dorcas florus ( w. h. edwards ) at " garnett 's ranche " near lundbreck at the mouth of the crowsnest pass ( bird and ferris 1979 ) .
as geddes visited and likely also stayed at garnett 's ranch , which served as a base for geology field parties ( inglis 1978 ) , geddes undoubtedly also collected moths at the ranch .
the type locality of gortyna intermedia barnes & benjamin is therefore restricted to lundbreck , municipality of crowsnest pass , alberta .
the diverse montane fauna of southwestern alberta continues to yield previously undocumented moth species ( schmidt 2007 ) , and the persistence of an undiscovered population of hydraecia intermedia is certainly possible. " the holotype of hydraecia intermedia resembles the single specimen of hydraecia obliqua in the cnc from terrace in west - central british columbia .
this locality is far north of the continuous distribution of hydraecia obliqua , which ends near vancouver , british columbia .
this specimen is structurally similar to other hydraecia obliqua populations , not hydraecia intermedia .
all british columbia hydraecia obliqua species - group specimens from east of the cascade mountains and british columbia coast ranges are typical hydraecia medialis , including from cranbrook which is the closest locality to the crowsnest pass locality of hydraecia intermedia .
nonetheless , it is interesting to speculate that hydraecia intermedia could be an eastern population of hydraecia obliqua .
we retain hydraecia intermedia as a species because of the structural differences between it and hydraecia obliqua , and because there are no records of similar specimens in central british columbia between terrace and crowsnest pass .
although the present reduction of this species - group to three species - hydraecia intermedia , hydraecia medialis , and hydraecia obliqua - is best supported by the available data there are two remaining issues that cannot be solved with the information at hand .
a large series of specimens from the east slope of the cascades at camp sherman , jefferson county , oregon at osac show possible intergradation between hydraecia obliqua and hydraecia medialis , with some specimens that are difficult to assign to either species .
this raises the possibility that the original hypothesis that hydraecia obliqua and hydraecia medialis are the same species could be correct despite the different barcodes in coastal and interior populations .
barcode or other dna data from this population might help to elucidate its significance but is not available .
similarly in the southwest , at the other end of the rasenkranz , more dna samples from colorado , utah , and arizona would be helpful to exclude the presence of an undiscovered species amongst the colorful populations that occur there. of these , a dusky red - brown population from east - central arizona is the most distinctive .

the name is derived from the latin niger meaning black or dusky .
it refers to the forewing color of the moth. diagnosis .
fishia nigrescens is distinguished from other north american fishia species by the charcoal - gray forewing without warm brown or reddish shades .
other western north american species are either much lighter gray ( fishia yosemitae ( grote ) ( fig. 29 )) or have brown color on the forewing ( fishia discors ( grote ) and fishia connecta ( smith )) .
the reniform spot of fishia nigrescens is arrowhead shaped with a deep lateral indentation. that of fishia yosemitae is an upright ovoid shape with only a weak lateral indentation .
in the male genitalia , the valve of fishia nigrescens can be told from that of fishia yosemitae by the shape of the digitus .
in fishia nigrescens the two prongs of the bifid digitus are unequal in length with a long dorsal and short ventral process .
in fishia yosemitae these processes are shorter and of similar length .
the female genitalia of fishia nigrescens differ from those of fishia yosemitae in the shape of the left posterior projection of the corpus bursae , blunter and more conical in fishia nigrescens and rounder in fishia yosemitae .
the bursa of fishia nigrescens has five signa whereas that of fishia yosemitae has three , lacking two small signa at the anterior end. description .

distribution and biology .
fishia nigrescens occurs in central and eastern oregon , nevada , eastern california , and arizona .
its flight season is late fall , usually during october .
the habitat is sage steppe , often in open juniper forest in oregon .
a specimen of this species was reared from rabbitbrush ( ericameria nauseosa ( pallas ex pursh ) g.l. nesom & baird ) ( asteraceae ) in oregon .
the larva was collected in may , pupated in june , and emerged in late september of the same year .
it was described as green with a white lateral band. remarks .
fishia yosemitae was described as cucullia yosemitae grote .
the extant type at the amnh and those of its synonyms described from western north america , fishia exhilarata smith and fishia betsia smith , were examined from photographs to exclude the possibility that one of them could be the correct name for fishia nigrescens .
specimens of fishia nigrescens from oregon are darker than those from nevada and eastern california , whereas those from arizona are slightly lighter gray .

wfbm , gpc , lgcc , oda , osac. etymology .
the subspecies name is derived from orcinus orca , the killer whale , and is a noun in apposition .
it refers to the moth 's pacific coast distribution , large size , and nearly black and white forewing. diagnosis .
subspecies orca is larger than other populations of xestia perquiritata ( morrison ) .
it is the only subspecies in which the wing is uniform black with unmarked white filling of the lines and spots .
the western mountain subspecies xestia perquiritata partita ( mcdunnough ) ( fig. 31 ) has occasional melanic specimens .
these are smaller than xestia perquiritata orca ( forewing length 16 - 20 mm for subspecies partita ; 21 - 23 mm for xestia perquiritata orca ) and differ in having light gray forewing lines and spots as well as darker gray scales in the central reniform spot .
these markings are pure white or cream in subspecies orca .
the valve of the male genitalia of xestia perquiritata orca is more massive than that of subspecies partita , reflecting the larger size of the moth .
the female genitalia of xestia perquiritata orca were not examined but are unlikely to differ significantly from those of other xestia perquiritata populations illustrated in lafontaine ( 1998 ). description .

clasper shark - fin shaped , oriented slightly mesially at origin and curved nearly 90degrees laterally to project dorsolaterally with tip slightly dorsal to costa .
digitus weak , broadly triangular .
apex of valve as described above without an expanded cucullus or corona .
aedeagus long and tubular , 8 x as long as wide , gradually widening from mid - shaft to apex , bearing patches of fine spinules on left side of mid - portion and on right side of apex .
vesica a simple membranous tube , 0.8 x as long as aedeagus and 0.3 x as wide as long ; basilar vesica recurved 180degrees dorsad and rightward so that mid - vesica projects toward base of aedeagus and distal portion curved additional 45degrees leftward to overlap aedeagus .
female genitalia - not examined .
distribution and biology .
this moth is restricted to the immediate pacific coast of oregon and washington , usually within several hundred meters of the shore .
it has been collected from the vicinity of newport on the central oregon coast north to neah bay on the northwest tip of the olympic peninsula in washington .
subspecies xestia perquiritata orca flies during late july and august .
the food plant is unknown , but other subspecies of xestia perquiritata have been reared from conifers in the family pinaceae , particularly firs ( abies spp. ) and spruces ( picea spp . )
( lafontaine 1998 ) .
based on the composition of the forests where xestia perquiritata orca occurs the most likely food plant is sitka spruce ( picea sitchensis ( bong. ) carr. ) , although grand fir ( abies grandis ( dougl. ) forbes ) is possible. remarks .
the genus xestia was revised for north america by lafontaine ( 1998 ) .
he considered a specimen in the cnc from newport , oregon to be a melanic xestia perquiritata partita ( mcdunnough ) , the western north american subspecies of this boreal and montane moth .
at the time , the coast population was only known from a few specimens from this locality and only one of these was at the cnc .
it is now apparent that distinct coastal populations of xestia perquiritata have a range that extends at least as far north as the olympic peninsula and are nearly uniform in appearance .
this subspecies might have a wider distribution on the coasts of northwestern california , british columbia , and alaska .

discussion the taxonomic changes and new taxa descriptions in this paper are part of an ongoing effort to understand fully the macromoth fauna of the pnw .
once published , these changes will be added to the website pacific northwest moths ( http :// pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu / ) .
although the focus of this work is regional , the genera resapamea and hydraecia in the tribe apameini of the noctuidae are partially revised herein .
this piecemeal approach may be less optimal than an all - encompassing generic revision , however , there are at present barriers that preclude satisfactory completion of such a study in both genera .
resapamea and thespecies in the hydraecia obliqua species - group are similar in that structural differences between species are slight ( e. g. , figs 38 - 41 ) .
therefore , other distinguishing features such as differences in biology or dna sequences , like barcodes , assume greater importance for defining species boundaries .
the most readily available dna sequencing techniques require recently collected material , preferably less than ten years old .
most north american museum material is significantly older than this and fresher material is not currently available for these species from areas that are likely to be critical to solving the remaining quandaries .
collectors are encouraged to seek out and submit specimens for dna sequencing of hydraecia from the east slope of the cascades in oregon and the southwest , and resapamea innota and resapamea enargia from any part of the western united states .
any hydraecia specimens from central british columbia or near the border of alberta and british columbia might shed light on the relationship of hydraecia intermedia to hydraecia obliqua .

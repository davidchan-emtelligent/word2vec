to consider the impact of ageing requires some useful means of measuring variability in health in animals of the same age .
in humans , this variability has been quantified by counting age - related health deficits in a frailty index .
here we show the results of extending that approach to mice .
across the life course , many important features of deficit accumulation are present in both species .
these include gradual rates of deficit accumulation ( slope = 0.029 in humans ; 0.036 in mice ) , a submaximal limit ( 0.54 in humans ; 0.44 in mice ) , and a strong relationship to mortality ( 1.05 [ 1.04 - 1.05 ] in humans ; 1.15 [ 1.12 - 1.18 ] in mice ) .
quantifying deficit accumulation in individual mice provides a powerful new tool that can facilitate translation of research on ageing , including in relation to disease .
in biological systems , mortality risk typically ( if not universally ) 1 increases with age .
even so , that risk does not increase uniformly .
in clinical medicine , frailty , the noun , refers to this heterogeneity in risk amongst people of the same age2 .
frail , the adjective , is used to describe those ( mostly older people ) at increased risk3 .
understanding frailty is important clinically , and not just in defining who is at greatest risk .
frailty also strongly influences what a given disease might look like .
for example , in younger people or fit older adults , a heart attack is commonly signaled by chest pain .
in frail older adults with a heart attack , chest pain is less common than are symptoms such as acute confusion , or being " generally unwell " or taking to bed4 .
the risk from frailty is thereby compounded by the adverse consequences of delay in diagnosis .
such considerations mean that understanding frailty is important in understanding age - related disease .
across the adult lifespan , the risk of most diseases increases with age , meaning that most diseases occur most often in older adults .
even so , for reasons of convention , convenience , cost and clarity of focus ( or so it is claimed ) , most medical research is done on models that use young animals , which have not lived long enough to accumulate other health deficits5 .
under - representation of ageing is important because " the problems of old age come as a package " 56. that package appears to influence both disease expression and disease risk .
for example , in blood vessels , age - dependent cellular / tissue damage that goes unrepaired gives hypertension , a measurable ( if asymptomatic ) health deficit .
hypertension , in turn , increases the risk of clinically evident diseases such as chronic kidney injury , congestive heart failure and stroke .
it is becoming clear that a range of subclinical and clinical age - related deficits , that are themselves not recognized as disease - specific risks , are associated with a greater chance of common age - related illness in older adults .
one such example is the risk of dementia , which increases more in relation to the combined effects of several age - related health deficits ( e.g. problems with teeth , feet , bowels ) than it does in relation to such traditional risk factors as hypertension or diabetes7 .
similarly , the risk of osteoporotic fracture is more closely related to such age - related health deficits ( known as " non - traditional risk factors ") than it is to traditional risk factors such as body mass index and bone mineral density8 .
the same is true for non - traditional risk factors associated with coronary heart disease hospitalization and death9 .
together these results suggest that seemingly unrelated items which manifest as age - related health deficits might reflect more widespread processes of ageing , which , as they accumulate , influence late - life illness510 .
this is why it is of some consequence that the problems of old age do not travel alone : to understand disease risk and expression , we must consider otherwise unmeasured heterogeneity in the health status of the organism / people so affected10 .
to reduce unmeasured heterogeneity , we quantify how the package of age - related deficits influences the overall state of health .
in humans we pioneered the concept of a " frailty index " .
in a single variable , it measures a wide range of age - related health deficits ( e.g. symptoms , signs , laboratory abnormalities ) 111213. with a frailty index , the actual number of health deficits in an individual is counted and divided by the total number of potential health deficits that were considered , to yield a number between 0 ( no deficits ) and 1 ( all possible deficits ) .
for example , where 50 health deficits were considered ( as with a health record or epidemiological survey ) , the frailty index score of someone with 5 deficits would be 5 / 50 = 0.10 .
remarkably , even when differing health deficits , and differing numbers of health deficits are considered , their age - related accumulation shows significant stochastic dynamics , which for populations give characteristic rates of increase across the life course1214 .
further , people with high frailty index scores are at greatly increased risk of adverse outcomes , including death12 .
the force of mortality in relation to deficit accumulation gives a limit to frailty , such that the highest value of the frailty index score is not the arithmetic limit of 1 .
instead , people with high frailty scores cannot survive additional health deficits ; in almost every report , > 99 % of observed frailty index scores are < 0.71516 .
in these ways , a frailty index based on deficit accumulation allows ageing itself to be investigated17 .
it can aid understanding for both specific age - related processes ( e.g. cellular mechanisms related to myocyte hypertrophy18 and at larger scales , such as the health span response to calorie restriction or resveratrol19 or the network dynamics of ageing20 ) .
here , to evaluate whether quantifying deficit accumulation in humans can be translated to mice , we first replicated a frailty index analysis across the life course in humans .
we then translated a life course frailty index in a naturally ageing colony of a common mouse model , the c57bl / 6 strain , which we followed to extinction .
we demonstrate similar properties of the frailty index in both humans and mice , including a characteristic distribution , similar values at similar life stages , a dose - response relationship with mortality and a submaximal limit .
these properties arise even though individual deficits vary in how they accumulate .
together , these properties of age - related deficit accumulation allow a better way to understand disease mechanisms in the context of the overall extent of ageing in given subjects , including through the use of powerful genetic interventions .
the approach can also improve the cost - effectiveness of studying ageing animals , thereby facilitating translational research across a range of illnesses .
results individual deficits accumulated variably in both humans and mice individual age - related deficits accumulated variably in humans of both sexes ( fig. 1a , upper panels 1 - 3 ) , men only ( fig. 1b , middle panels 1 - 3 ) and in male mice ( fig. 1c , lower panels 1 - 3 ) .
some deficits increased slowly at a near - constant rate ( panels 1a1 , 1b1 , 1c1 ) .
other deficits showed negative curvature ( panels 1a2 , 1b2 and 1c2 ) or upward curvature ( panels 1a3 , 1b3 and 1c3 ) .
in humans and in mice the mean frailty index increased with age in humans , the mean value of the frailty index increased from 0.08 +/ - 0.07 in younger people ( 20 - 44 years ) to 0.16 +/ - 0.11 in the middle - aged ( 45 - 64 years ) to 0.24 +/ - 0.13 in those aged 65 + years ( table 1 ) .
for men , the corresponding numbers were younger = 0.07 +/ - 0.06 ; middle aged = 0.14 +/ - 0.11 and ; older = 0.23 +/ - 0.12 .
in mice , the mean for the whole set of observations ( n = 1074 ) increased from 0.05 +/ - 0.05 in the younger mice ( 30 - 299 days ) to 0.21 +/ - 0.04 in the middle - aged mice ( 300 - 599 days ) to 0.29 +/ - 0.07 in the older mice ( 600 + days ) .
the mean value (+/ - standard deviation ) of the frailty index for all observations in humans ( n = 9179 ) was 0.15 +/ - 0.12 ; for men ( n = 4405 ) , the mean frailty index was 0.14 +/ - 0.12 ( fig. 2a,b ) .
for mice , for all observations ( n = 1032 ) , the mean frailty index was 0.16 +/ - 0.12 .
the mean frailty index increased across the life course ( fig. 2c ) .
the slope of the natural logarithm of the frailty index versus age , which has been shown to correspond to the rate of deficit accumulation in animals and in people12 , was 0.029 in humans ( 0.029 in men ) and 0.036 in mice .
in humans and mice the frailty index distribution broadened with age the ranges differed only a little by age .
in humans , the younger subjects' frailty index range was 0.00 - 0.65 ( fig. 3 , panel a1 ) , compared with 0 - 0.68 in the middle aged ( fig. 3 , panel a2 ) and 0.01 - 0.77 in the older group ( fig. 3 , panel a3 ) .
in men , the corresponding ranges were 0.00 - 0.55 ( younger ; fig. 3 , panel b1 ) ; 0.00 - 0.59 ( middle - aged ; fig. 3 , panel b2 ) and 0.03 - 0.77 ( older ; fig. 3 , panel b3 ) .
the ranges in mice were 0.00 - 0.22 ( younger ; fig. 3 , panel c1 ) ; 0.13 - 0.32 ( middle - aged ; fig. 3 , panel c2 ) and 0.16 - 0.55 ( older ; fig. 3 , panel c3 ) .
even though the absolute range differed little with age , the 99 % limit ( i.e. the highest frailty index scores that encompassed 99 % of the observations ) showed a noticeable difference across the life course .
for the younger groups , the 99 % limit was lowest ( humans = 0.35 ; men only = 0.34 ; mice = 0.18 ) .
the middle - aged groups showed the next largest ( humans = 0.51 ; men only = 0.49 ; mice = 0.31 ) .
the largest was seen in the older groups ( humans = 0.59 ; men only = 0.58 ; mice = 0.49 ) .
in short , the distribution of frailty index scores broadened in all groups with age ( fig. 3 ) .
greater frailty shortens survival in mice and humans higher frailty index scores were associated with reduced survival in all groups ( fig. 4 ; table 2 ) .
deficits were less lethal in women than in men , so that the survival for the whole human sample ( fig. 4a , table 2 ) was greater than for men ( fig. 4b ) .
deficits were most lethal in mice ( fig. 4c ) .
for all groups , more information was provided by frailty for older subjects ( fig. 4a,b,c panels 2,3 ) than for the youngest ones ( fig. 4a,b,c panel 1 ) .
the hazard ratios for mouse survival were higher for any 0.01 frailty index increment than they were for the human samples ( table 2 ) .
discussion if research on the diseases of ageing is lagging by neglecting the other problems that come with age56 , any remedy requires that those other problems be quantified172122 .
here we have shown that such a quantitative measure , a clinical frailty index based on health deficit accumulation , can be translated into mice and used to follow them across the life course ; this last was endorsed as greatly preferable in a recent multidisciplinary report21 .
the mouse frailty index showed several essential features seen with human ageing .
although individual deficit accumulation patterns varied , the distribution of the frailty index broadened with age and mean deficit accumulation increased .
at all ages , greater deficit accumulation was associated with reduced survival in age - adjusted models .
the frailty index approach offers a probe by which the impact of individual problems can be understood in the context not just of chronological ageing , but of the increased hazard that goes with greater deficit accumulation23 .
the approach has been extended to demonstrate that , across a spectrum from subcellular to clinically detectable changes , frailty correlates with the degree of myocyte hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction18 as well as sinoatrial node dysfunction , myocardial interstitial fibrosis and altered expression of matrix metalloproteinases24 in the ageing heart .
given the potential repurposing of existing , approved medications such as rapamycin and metformin25 , and pending the development of a comprehensive system of ageing biomarkers26 , it also is a ready - made candidate for understanding how interventions to modify aspects of ageing processes might be evaluated27 .
a parallel approach and terminology can also facilitate clinician - researcher interactions , the relative lack of which is seen as an important barrier in translational research in ageing28 .
employing a frailty index can facilitate insights into how ageing works .
here , even amongst mice of similar genetic backgrounds , raised under similar circumstances , the level of deficit accumulation varied .
reflected in the broadening of the distribution of the frailty index with age , the stochasticity of frailty dynamics is significant as deficits accumulate20 .
given that some degree of deficit accumulation is reversible29 , understanding factors that allow deficits to decrease , even in old age , is important .
a 2016 report showed that the increase in deficit accumulation can be modelled solely on the basis of deficit interaction , without invoking time - dependent damage20 as has classically been done in studying age and mortality3031 .
here , deficits were both relatively higher and more lethal in mice , suggesting that their interactions are more damaging .
if we accept that the accumulation of deficits reflects damage that goes unremoved or unrepaired2029 then it follows that , even in an animal care facility environment in which the animals are relatively protected from predation , greater levels and lethality of age - related deficits likely reflect differences in investment in repair between mice and people .
a frailty index is especially useful in increasing the amount of data that can be collected on ageing animals .
the high cost of ageing research reflects in part that unexpected death results in no data being available on that animal .
in contrast , tracking frailty scores can allow at least some features of age - related change associated with specific conditions to be investigated , even when animals die ahead of planned experimental evaluation .
where death occurs before an experiment can be conducted , frailty index data can be compared with necropsy findings .
our data must be interpreted with caution .
the human data included men and women .
the mouse data are for males only .
we recognize the great virtue in studying ageing and frailty in female animals32 ; some data collection with female mice is ongoing and we plan to collect more .
we also lack data on very frail mice ( e.g. the 99 % frailty index limit was 0.44 ) compared with very frail people .
this reflects good animal husbandry practices .
indeed , we were intrigued that the veterinarians and animal care attendants who observed the mice , but who did not score a frailty index , the animals which they identified as needing to be sacrificed due to age - related debility had frailty index scores between 0.50 - 0.54 .
tracking changes in the degree of deficit accumulation might provide some remedy against unexpected death and loss of animals before planned experiments .
the designs of the two data sources are also different .
the mouse data represent a small cohort followed to extinction , whereas we have only cross - sectional data with necessarily time - limited mortality follow - up on the humans , albeit with a much larger sample size .
we attempted to mitigate the small mouse sample size by multiple observations .
we were careful not to double - count mice in the same age range .
translation here was from human studies that then were employed in mice .
" back translation " is now under way .
the version of the mouse frailty index used here was modelled on a comprehensive geriatric assessment , and is suitable for longitudinal use .
in contrast , the initial mouse frailty index chiefly used laboratory test data , arising in the context of terminal experiments18 .
more recently , we have developed a version of the frailty index for use in humans that employs only laboratory test data , as a means of understanding subclinical aspects of frailty3334 .
frailty is also now a target for treatment in and of itself35 , arguing further for integrative methods for its measurement .
for these reasons , combining the clinical and laboratory - based versions , in both humans and in mice , is motivating additional inquires by our group .
methods study design and sample : mice two hundred fifty - seven male c57bl / 6j mice were purchased from charles river laboratories ( st. constant , quebec ) at 3 to 4 weeks of age .
six mice died before any frailty assessments were completed , so these mice were excluded from the analysis for a final sample size of 251 mice ( table 1 ) .
mice were housed in the carleton animal care facility in groups of three to five mice per microisolator cage and followed throughout their lives in a longitudinal study .
they were kept on a 12 - hour light / dark cycle and had free access to water and food ( prolab rmh 3500 , purina labdiet , aberfoyle , ontario , canada ) .
animal protocols followed the canadian council on animal care guide to the care and use of experimental animals ( ccac , ottawa , on : vol. 1 , 2nd ed .
1993 ; vol. 2 , 1984 ) and were approved by the dalhousie university committee on laboratory animals .
no randomisation was used .
for all experiments , the investigator knew the age of the animal , but not its current or prior frailty scores .
study design and sample : humans secondary data for the human sample were acquired from the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) , a series of cross - sectional surveys investigating the health status of a nationally representative sample with examination , questionnaire and laboratory data36 .
here , the 2003 - 2004 and 2005 - 2006 cohorts were amalgamated to give 20470 potential participants , of whom 10020 individuals were aged 20 and older. of these 10020 , we excluded 841 subjects due to missing frailty data and 10 additional subjects with missing mortality data for a final sample size of 9169 ( table 1 ) .
criteria for a valid frailty score are detailed below .
the nhanes survey protocol was approved by the national center for health statistics research ethics review board of the centers for disease control and prevention , protocol 98 - 12 for the 2003 - 2004 sample and protocol 2005 - 2006 for the 2005 - 2006 cohort37 .
all participants provided written informed consent .
all methods were performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki regarding ethical standards for research involving human subjects .
data availability data were accessed through a public access data file available on the nhanes website http :// www.cdc.gov / nchs / nhanes.htm36 .
follow up mortality data were available using public - use linked mortality files , where mortality assessment was based on a probabilistic match between the nhanes records and the death certificate records of the national death index using available identifying information ( i.e. , social security number , first name , middle initial , last name , month of birth , year of birth , day of birth , sex , father 's surname , state of birth , race , state of residence , marital status ) ( http :// www.cdc.gov / nchs / ndi / index.htm ) 38 .
time to death was calculated using person years of follow - up from the examination date until date of death or until the subject was censored on december 31st 2011 .
the datasets generated and / or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request .
frailty index construction in humans the frailty index , as originally developed for use in humans , operationalizes frailty by dividing the number of deficits in an individual by the total number of deficits considered39 .
here , the human frailty index comprised 46 deficits .
all deficits were coded so that the presence of a deficit was scored as 1 and its absence was scored as 0 .
for variables with an intermediate response , a score of 0.5 was assigned .
the frailty index was calculated by dividing the number of deficits present by the total number of deficits considered .
for example , a subject with 25 of a possible 50 deficits would have a frailty index score of 25 / 50 = 0.5 a score of 0 represents full health , whereas a score of 1 represents a theoretical ' complete ' frailty .
the human frailty index has been validated previously in the nhanes population40 .
a complete list of the deficits , procedures used and the coding guide has been published elsewhere40 .
briefly , to be included in a frailty index , a deficit must meet the following criteria39 : ( 1 ) it must increase with age ; ( 2 ) it must be health - related ; ( 3 ) it must be present in at least 1 % of the study population ; ( 4 ) it must not be present in 80 % of the study population before age 80 ; ( 5 ) it must not be missing in more than 5 % of the study population .
continuous variables were coded using cut - points proposed in the literature , as described in our previous work34 .
empirically , > 99 % of people have frailty index scores < 0.715 .
a frailty score was only calculated for participants in whom < 20 % of the variables were missing .
to calculate the frailty index in those missing fewer than 20 % of variables , the denominator was reduced to reflect the number of available variables .
frailty index construction in mice our group has adapted this method to create a frailty index tool based on the accumulation of clinically apparent health deficits in naturally ageing mice4142 .
a published checklist4142 was used to evaluate 31 parameters that assessed deficits in the integument , musculoskeletal system , vestibulocochlear and auditory systems , ocular and nasal systems , digestive system , urogenital system , respiratory system and signs of discomfort .
mice were also weighed and body surface temperature measured with an infrared probe ( infrascan ; la crosse technology ) .
body weight ( g ) and body surface temperature ( degreesc ) were scored based on deviation from the study average for that age and described previously4142 .
frailty was assessed at approximately 1 , 6 , 12 and 18 months and at varying ages thereafter .
we also recorded the time to death for each mouse .
mortality occurred when animals either died suddenly or were euthanized due to illness .
statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted using spss 20 , r 3.2.4 , matlab and sigmaplot .
an alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance .
demographic characteristics of the sample were expressed using mean frailty index scores +/ - sd , range ( min and max ) and 99th percentiles .
the 99 % limit was defined as the highest frailty index score that encompassed 99 % of the observations .
the association between age and the prevalence of selected individual deficits were graphed for mouse and human data .
density distribution curves were created for all frailty index scores .
curve estimation was used to assess the relationship between age and frailty score .
to examine frailty across the life course , analyses were stratified by age group ( 20 - 44 , 45 - 64 , 65 + years of age for humans ; 30 - 299 , 300 - 599 , 600 + days for mice ) .
for the mouse frailty measurements , which were longitudinal , each mouse is represented only once in each age stratum , with the exception of the cox regression described below .
to investigate the classification and predictive ability of the frailty index score on mortality , we employed aucs and age - and sex - adjusted cox regression models .
for the mouse data , frailty was treated as a time - dependent covariate in cox regressions .
time was used as a time - variable in the cox model .
for these cox regression models , power was high for both the mice data and the human data ( 1 - beta > 0.95 at alpha < 0.05 ) .
time intervals were created based on the time between the relevant frailty assessment and the death of each mouse .
obviously , each mouse death can be counted only once , but each mouse was assessed over their life span .
the frailty index at the beginning of each age interval ( young , middle - aged , old ) was related to survival within that interval .
each hazard ratio represents the increased risk of mortality for every 0.01 increase in frailty index score .
for the analysis by age group , a variable was calculated for each of the three age groups ( i.e. , 30 - 299 , 300 - 599 , 600 +) .
similar to a dummy variable , when the young group was the target , each mouse was represented by its frailty index value for time intervals ending at < 300 days ; values higher than this were scored as 0 .
similarly , when the target was middle age , each mouse between 300 and 599 days was represented by its frailty index score , and was scored 0 otherwise .
likewise , the old variable had the corresponding frailty index values for intervals > 600 days and was scored 0 otherwise .
the three variables were included in a single cox regression .
kaplan meier survival curves demonstrated differences in mortality rates between frailty groups .

figure 1 individual deficits accumulate at varying rates in people and in mice .
( a ) mean scores from pooled data from men and women show examples of individual deficits that exhibit different patterns of accumulation with age ( n = 9169 people ) .
difficulty dressing ( panel 1 ) , high blood pressure ( panel 2 ) and cataract surgery ( panel 3 ) accumulated at different rates over time .
( b , panels 1 , 2 , 3 ) rates of deficit accumulation were similar for men only when compared to the sample shown in a ( n = 4383 men ) .
data were binned and averaged each year for a and b .
( c , panels 1 , 2 , 3 ) tumours ( panel 1 ) , gait ( panel 2 ) and tremor ( panel 3 ) are shown as examples of deficits that demonstrate different progressions with age in male mice .
longitudinal data for each deficit were obtained from the entire cohort of mice and binned in 100 day increments ( n = 251 mice ) .
figure 2 mean +/ - sd frailty index ( fi ) scores increase at similar rates in people and in mice .
( a ) data from 46 individual deficits were used to calculate a fi score for each person .
fi scores increased with age in the pooled sample of men and women ( n = 9169 ) .
data were binned in one year increments and fi scores were averaged at each age .
( b ) similar results were seen in men only , using the same increments , averages and binning ( n = 4383 ) .
( c ) an fi score was calculated from 31 individual mouse deficits for all 251 mice .
data were binned in 100 day increments and fi scores were averaged for each age group (+/ - sd ) .
in each panel , the essential idea of frailty - unmeasured heterogeneity in the health status of organisms of the same age - is evident in the standard deviations .
even so , the fits to a linear model for the mean values were r2 = 0.97 for humans , 0.96 for men only and 0.93 for mice .
the fits to an exponential model were r2 = 0.98 for humans , 0.96 for men only and 0.87 for mice .
all the fits were significant for p < 0.0001 .
figure 3 mean frailty index ( fi ) scores increased and their distribution broadened with age in humans and in mice .
( a ) frequency distributions of fi scores for younger ( 20 - 44 years ; panel 1 ) , middle - aged ( 45 - 64 years ; panel 2 ) and older people ( 65 + years ; panel 3 ) are illustrated .
the frailty distribution moved right and broadened with age .
( b , panels 1 , 2 , 3 ) results were similar in men only when compared to the pooled sample shown in a .
( c , panels 1 , 2 , 3 ) frequency distributions of the fi scores for male mice also shifted to the right and broadened with increasing age .
data were stratified by age into three groups ; younger ( 30 - 299 days old , panel 1 ) , middle - aged ( 300 - 599 days old , panel 2 ) and old mice ( 600 + days old , panel 3 ) .
figure 4 high frailty index ( fi ) scores predict mortality at all ages both in humans and in mice .
( a ) kaplan meier survival curves stratified by 0.1 increments of the fi for younger ( 20 - 44 years ; panel a1 , n = 4083 ) , middle - aged ( 45 - 64 years ; panel a2 , n = 2642 ) and older people ( 65 + years ; panel a3 , n = 2444 ) are illustrated .
at any age , higher frailty scores were associated with reduced survival .
( b ) results were similar for men , ( younger , panel b1 , n = 1867 , middle - aged , panel b2 , n = 1292 , older , panel b3 , n = 1242 ) although mortality was higher in men than in the whole human sample .
( c ) kaplan meier survival curves were also constructed for younger ( 30 - 299 days ; panel c1 , n = 251 ) , middle - aged ( 300 - 599 days ; panel c2 , n = 229 ) and older ( 600 + days ; panel c3 , n = 158 ) mice .
each mouse is represented only once in each age stratum .
in general , as fi scores increased survival declined in all three age groups of mice .
mortality was high in one fi stratum in the older group ( e.g. fi = 0.1 - 0.2 ) .
this reflected a small number of very old mice with low fi scores and severe deficits that required immediate euthanasia .

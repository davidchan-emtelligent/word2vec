background dengue epidemics have been reported in brazil since 1981 .
in manaus , a large city in the amazon region , dengue is endemic with all four - virus serotypes ( denv - 1 , - 2 , - 3 , and - 4 ) simultaneously causing human disease .
in 2008 , during a surveillance of dengue virus in mosquitoes in the district of tancredo neves in manaus , 260 mosquitoes of aedes genus were captured , identified and grouped into pools of 10 mosquitoes .
findings rna extracts of mosquito pools were tested by a rt - hemi - nested - pcr for detection of flaviviruses .
one amplicon of 222 bp , compatible with dengue virus serotype 4 , was obtained from a pool of aedes aegypti .
the nucleotide sequence of the amplicon indicated that the mosquitoes were infected with denv - 4 of genotype i. this virus of asian origin has been described in manaus in 2008 infecting acute febrile illness patients .
conclusion this is the first report of dengue virus serotype 4 genotype i infecting aedes aegypti in the americas .
emerging flavivirus dengue serotype 4 in brazil rt - hemi - nested - pcr for flavivirus findings dengue virus serotypes 1 through 4 ( denv - 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) are the most important arboviruses worldwide based on number of cases and mortality .
denv infects approximately 50 million of people per year in 100 countries [ 1 ] .
in brazil , the incidence of dengue has been on an upward trend , and in the last decade 700,000 cases have been reported per year .
most brazilian states are infested by aedes aegypti and endure dengue transmission .
the average age of dengue hemorrhagic fever patients has decreased in the last years , affecting a rising proportion of children .
in recent years dengue outbreaks have included many atypical cases , including myocarditis , hepatitis , meningoencephalitis and acute kidney failure , and fatality rates have also increased [ 2,3 ] .
denv is transmitted to humans mainly by aedes aegypti mosquitoes , which acquire the infection throught blood feeding on infected individuals or by transovarial transmission [ 4 ] .
the first isolation of a denv ( denv - 1 and - 4 ) in brazil occurred in 1981 , in the northern state of roraima , from acute febrile patients [ 5 ] .
then , denv - 4 had disappeared from the country until 2008 , when it was found infecting acute febrile patients in the city of manaus , the capital of amazonas state , which is located in the middle of the rain forest [ 6 ] .
a phylogenetic analysis showed that the denv - 4 isolated in manaus belonged to the genotype i , which has never been described in the american continent [ 7 ] .
in 2010 , another denv - 4 genotype was detected in roraima state ; the genotype ii , which has been circulating in central america , the northern of south america and the caribbean [ 8 ] .
this denv - 4 genotype ii rapidly spread through brazil , producing outbreaks in the most populated areas of the northeastern and southeastern of the country ( ministry of health of brazil , 2012 ) .
recently , the origin and evolution of denv - 4 genotypes ( i and ii ) from northern and northeastern brazil were analyzed [ 9 ] .
we report here the first detection of denv - 4 genotype i infecting aedes aegypti in the city of manaus .
in 2008 , as a part of a vector surveillance program for dengue virus detection , 203 aedes aegypti and 57 aedes albopictus were captured using adult mosquito traps in tancredo neves , a poor district of manaus city .
the mosquitoes were identified based on morphological characteristics in co2 atmosphere and those from the same specie or genus , captured in the same place , were pooled (~ 10 adults / pool ) based on day of collection .
a volume of 1.5 ml pbs ( ph7.8 ) containing 4 % bovine albumin was added to each pool of mosquito .
the insects were crushed using plastic pistils , and centrifuged at 2500x g for 30 minutes , at 4degreesc , to pellet the carcasses .
the supernatant was split in 2 aliquots and stored at - 80degreesc until use .
the rna from macerates of all mosquito pools was extracted using the qiamp viral rna mini kit ( qiagen , germany ) .
a rt - hemi - nested - pcr for detection of flaviviruses was used for testing these rna extracts as previously reported by bronzoni et al , 2005 [ 10 ] .
this test allows virus preliminary identification based on amplicon size : 472 base pair ( bp ) for denv - 1 , 316 bp for denv - 2 , 628 bp for denv - 3 , 222 bp for denv - 4 , 253 bp for yfv and 232 bp for slev [ 10 ] .
all molecular biology procedures were performed in order to avoid any type of contamination ; different rooms were used for rna purification , flavivirus genome amplification and pcr product analysis .
a number of 21 pools of aedes aegypti and 6 pools of aedes albopictus were tested .
one amplicon of 222 bp , compatible with denv - 4 , was obtained from a pool of aedes aegypti ( figure 1 ) .
the nucleotide sequence of 172 bp , of the amplicon obtained from rt - pcr , confirmed it was denv - 4 .
this amplicon was recovered from the agarose gel with the quiaquick gel extraction kit ( qiagen , usa ) and subjected to nucleotide sequencing with the abi prism ( r ) 3500 genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca - usa ) .
this sequence was named br / am / 5b / 2008 and registered in the european nucleotide archive ( embl nucleotide sequence database ) with the accession number he994136 .
the br / am / 5b / 2008 sequence was aligned with other 40 sequences belonging to denv - 4 isolated worldwide using the clustal w software [ 11 ] .
this alignment was used for phylogenetic inference using the neighbor - joining method included in the mega 5 software [ 12 ] .
the phylogenetic tree showed that the virus detected in this study belong to denv - 4 genotype i. figure 1 agarose gel electrophoresis 1.8 % showing amplicons obtained by flavivirus rt - pcr and hemi - nested - pcr from mosquitoes samples .

vector surveillance is at the root of dengue control and prevention , with many methods available for detecting the presence of the mosquito vectors , aedes aegypti and ae. albopictus , in or around human residences .
we show here an important result from a vector surveillance work performed in the city of manaus where dengue is hyperendemic and has an almost continuous circulation of all 4 dengue virus serotypes [ 13 ] .
denv - 4 was firstly described in manaus in 2008 infecting patients with acute febrile illness [ 6 ] .
curiously it was found that this denv - 4 belonged to the genotype i , which is of asian origin and was never described in the american continent [ 6,7 ] .
phylogenetic analysis of core - prm junction of denv - 4 genotype i isolates from manaus city showed that these isolates are grouped together with philippines / 1956 / h241 ( ay947539 ) and china _ guangzhou _ b5 ( af289029 ) strains [ 7 ] .
the report of denv - 4 genotype i in manaus was seen with skepticism by the brazilian ministry of health .
however , probably , this virus might have been present in the region for some time , infecting patients and producing acute febrile illness but not spreading to other parts of brazil [ 6 ] .
the infection of aedes aegypti captured in 2008 by denv - 4 of genotype i reported here support previous finding that this new virus was really presented in manaus .
the topology of the phylogenetic tree suggests the existence of two clades within genotype i , represented by philippines and thailand strains , respectively .
the phylogenetic tree shows that the virus from manaus reported here is closely related to those found in china and philipines ( figure 2 ) .
recently , 16 full - length sequences of denv - 4 from brazilian isolates were obtained [ 9 ] .
we include the new sequences of denv - 4 from brazilian isolates available in gene bank .
in our phylogenetic analysis we observed that bhi _ 3681 ( jq513345 ) strain , isolated from human ( autochthonous febrile patient in 2011 in salvador , bahia state ) is phylogenetically related with our mosquitoes sample .
figure 2 denv - 4 phylogenetic tree based on the ns5 partial gene sequences .
the three was constructed using the neighbor - joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications .
denv - 1 to 3 was used as outgroup .
branch lengths are proportional to percentage of divergence .
tajima - nei nucleotide substitution model was used with a gamma distribution ( shape parameter = 1 ) .
the genbank accession numbers , species , the country of origin , and year of isolation are shown .
interestingly , the topology of phylogenetic tree showed that bhi _ 3681 ( jq513345 ) strain is most closely related to thailand isolates .
the introduction of denv - 4 genotype i might be related to trading among oriental companies that have facilities in the city of manaus and receive company worker visits and imported containers from asia .
denv - 4 of genotype ii has been also introduced in 2010 and presently , genotypes ( i and ii ) of the virus are circulating in manaus .
this work also showed that the rt - pcr and hemi - nested - pcr allowed the diagnosis of dengue virus infecting mosquitoes [ 4,10 ] .
therefore , it is a helpful tool for surveillance of dengue and other flaviviruses in vectors .

a sialic acid - targeted near - infrared profluorophore with ph - responsive fluorescence and photothermal properties was developed for fluorescence - guided staging and photothermal therapy of viable tumors exposed during surgery .
agents enabling tumor staging are valuable for cancer surgery .
herein , a targetable sialic acid - armed near - infrared profluorophore ( sa - pnir ) is reported for fluorescence guided tumor detection .
sa - pnir consists of a sialic acid entity effective for in vivo tumor targeting and a profluorophore which undergoes lysosomal acidity - triggered fluorogenic isomerization .
sa - pnir displays a number of advantageous biomedical properties in mice , e.g. high tumor - to - normal tissue signal contrast , long - term retention in tumors and low systemic toxicity .
in addition , sa - pnir effectively converts nir light into cytotoxic heat in cells , suggesting tumor - activatable photothermal therapy. with high performance tumor illumination and lysosome - activatable photothermal properties , sa - pnir is a promising agent for detection and photothermal ablation of surgically exposed tumors .
introduction with the increasing morbidity and mortality imposed by cancers , approaches that could improve the outcome of existing treatment modalities are of significance.1 surgical resection is a mainstay for solid tumor treatment , whereupon residual tumors due to incomplete resection often result in tumor relapse .
the utility of fluorescence guided surgery is demonstrated by recent clinical treatment of ovarian cancer with the aid of fluorescein - conjugated folate.2 recently , optical agents that could direct surgeons to tumor foci evasive to visual inspection have been intensively explored.2,3 high tumor - to - background signal contrast is paramount for tumor imaging .
as such , optical probes that could be activated to a " signal - on " state within tumors while remaining silent in off - target settings are critical to achieve low background signals.3,4 rhodamine derivatives with intramolecular spirorings are poised for proton - triggered fluorogenic opening of the intramolecular rings within acidic lysosomes , enabling high performance tumor imaging in mice models.5 relative to rhodamines , near - infrared ( nir ) dyes are advantageous for in vivo imaging as biological tissues display the least optical absorption and autofluorescence in the nir window ( 650 - 900 nm ). 6 nanomaterials that could convert nir irradiation into cytotoxic heat are being actively explored for photothermal cancer therapy.7 given concerns regarding the biosafety of nanomaterials , small molecular nir dyes could be biocompatible .
for instance , indocyanine green ( icg ) has been approved for clinical applications.8 analogous to acid - responsive rhodamines , probes displaying lysosomal acidity - activatable nir fluorescence and photothermal properties have been largely unexplored for intraoperative tumor therapy .
to achieve the high tumor - to - background signal contrast required for in vivo tumor imaging , dyes are often deliberately armed with tumor - homing entities , such as monoclonal antibodies , folates , aptamers , etc .
9 sialic acids ( sa ) are anionic monosaccharides commonly located at termini of cell surface glycans,10 and hypersialylation of cell surface constituents has been identified in a broad spectrum of cancers,11 suggesting enhanced metabolic demand for sa by these tumors cells .
fluorescein isothiocyanate - labelled sialic acid ( sa - fitc ) was recently employed for high performance tumor detection in mice , showing effective uptake of sa monosaccharide by metabolically active tumor cells.12 albeit selectively accumulated in tumors , sa - fitc suffers from " always - on " green fluorescence which has limited tissue penetration , and quick in vivo clearance which might lead to fast attenuation of tumor - associated signals during surgery.12 herein , we report a sialylated ph - activatable nir profluorophore ( sa - pnir ) for targeted tumor imaging and photothermal therapy in mice with dramatically improved pharmacokinetics critical for clinical translation .
sa - pnir consists of a sialic acid entity for effective in vivo tumor uptake and an activatable nir profluorophore which becomes photothermal and fluorescent within acidic lysosomes .
results and discussion acidic ph mediated fluorescence activation of sa - pnir optical probes with turn - on fluorescence inside tumors while being silent in off - target settings are beneficial for low - background tumor imaging.3,4 we recently reported the use of rhodamines with intramolecular spirorings for in vivo tumor detection via lysosomal acidity - triggered fluorogenic opening of the rings to give rhodamines.5 relative to red - emissive rhodamines , nir dyes are advantageous for bioimaging due to the enhanced tissue penetration of nir fluorescence and the minimal light absorption and autofluorescence of biological tissues in the nir region.6 hence , we set out to develop a nir probe , akin to rhodamine - lactams , for tumor imaging via lysosomal acidity - mediated fluorescence activation within tumors ( fig. 1b ). fig. 1 schematic of tumor illumination with a targetable sialic acid - conjugated nir profluorophore ( sa - pnir ) activatable to lysosomal acidity ( a ) ; nonfluorescent sa - pnir undergoes acidic ph - mediated fluorogenic opening of the intramolecular lactam to give fluorescent and photothermal sa - nir ( b ) .
(( e ) - 2 - ( 2 - ( 9 - ( 2 - carboxyphenyl ) - 6 - ( diethyl - amino ) - 2,3 - dihydro - 1h - xanthen - 4 - yl ) vinyl ) - 1,3,3 - trimethyl - 3h - indol - 1 - ium perchlorate ) , a nir dye reported by lin et al. , 13 was first amidated with ethylenediamine and then conjugated with 9 - amino - 9 - deoxy - 5 - n - acetylneuraminic acid to afford the desired sa - pnir in 32 % overall yield ( esi +) .
to probe its ph responsiveness , sa - pnir was spiked into buffers of ph 4.0 - 8.0 and the fluorescence emission and uv - vis - nir absorption of the solutions were recorded over the buffer ph range .
as shown in fig. 2 , sa - pnir exhibits nir absorption and fluorescence emission in acidic media , proving the proton - mediated isomerization of sa - pnir into fluorescent sa - nir as shown in fig. 1b .
ph titration shows that sa - pnir is weakly fluorescent at cytosolic ph ( ph 7.2 ) and yet exhibits enhanced fluorescence at ph 4.5 - 6.0 , which ideally matches the lysosomal ph window ( ph 4 - 6 ) .
these results indicate the applicability of sa - pnir to illuminating acidic lysosomes in living cells. fig. 2 ph responsiveness of sa - pnir .
sa - pnir was spiked into sodium phosphate buffer ( 100 mm , ph 4.0 - 8.0 ) containing 10 % acetonitrile ( v / v ) to give a final concentration of 10 mum .
fluorescence emission of the solutions was recorded using lambda ex @ 715 nm ( a ) and the fluorescence intensities at 740 nm were plotted against buffer ph ( b ) .
uv - vis - nir absorption spectra of the solutions were collected over the buffer ph range ( c ) and the absorbance at 715 nm was plotted as a function of buffer ph ( d ) .
illumination of acidic lysosomes in cells by sa - pnir lysosomes are the major intracellular acidic compartments and the number and acidity of lysosomes could be significantly boosted in cancer cells.14 to determine the performance of intracellular signal activation , hela cells , u87 - mg cells and raw 264.7 cells were cultured in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) supplemented with sa - pnir and then stained with lysotracker green dnd - 26 , referred to herein as lysotracker green .
confocal microscopy images show that nir fluorescence is clearly observed within all the three cell lines tested and colocalizes with lysotracker green specific for acidic lysosomes ( fig. 3 ) .
the colocalization confirms that sa - pnir could be taken up by these cells and then activated to fluorescent sa - nir within lysosomes .
to probe cellular uptake kinetics , hela , u87 - mg and raw 264.7 cells were loaded with sa - pnir and then stained with dii specific for plasma membranes .
the intracellular nir signals were determined after incubation for 1 h , 4 h and 24 h. it was revealed that the intracellular nir fluorescence intensified upon prolonged incubation ( fig. s1 , esi +) , suggesting continuous uptake of sa - pnir from the surrounding medium by these cell lines. fig. 3 lysosome illumination with sa - pnir .
hela , u87 - mg and raw 264.7 cells were cultured for 1 h with sa - pnir ( 100 mum ) in dmem and then stained with lysotracker green ( 1 mum ) for 20 min .
the cells were probed by confocal fluorescence microscopy .
merging of the sa - nir signal ( shown in red ) and that of lysotracker green ( shown in green ) revealed colocalization , as indicated by the yellow areas .
bars , 10 mum .
to assess the dependence of intracellular nir fluorescence on lysosomal acidity , we measured sa - pnir signals in cells treated with bafilomycin a1 ( bfa ) , which is a potent inhibitor of v - atpase and effectively alkalinizes lysosomes in bfa - treated cells.15 as shown in fig. 4 , the intracellular signals of sa - pnir largely vanished in hela , u87 - mg and raw 264.7 cells pretreated with bfa compared to the cells in the absence of bfa .
the bfa - and sa - pnir treated cells that displayed markedly decreased nir signals within the cells were further incubated in a phosphate buffer of ph 4.0. fig. 4 revealed the recovery of intense intracellular nir signals in the aforementioned hela , u87 - mg and raw 264.7 cells in acidic buffer , excluding the loss of intracellular sa - pnir in bfa - treated cells and further confirming the lysosomal ph dependent " turn - on " fluorescence of sa - pnir in cells .
solid tumors are hallmarked by acidic microenvironments due to metabolically accumulated lactic acid.16 the acidic microenvironment has been widely targeted for tumor therapy and imaging .
the recovered nir fluorescence of bfa - treated cells in acidic buffer strongly indicates that the acidic tumor microenvironments and tumor lysosomes might exert synergistic effects on signal activation of sa - pnir endocytosed into tumor cells in vivo. fig. 4 acidic ph - mediated fluorescence - on of sa - pnir within cells .
hela ( a ) , u87 - mg ( b ) and raw 264.7 ( c ) cells with or without bfa ( 50 nm ) pretreatment were cultured with sa - pnir ( 100 mum ) in dmem for 1 h and then stained with lysotracker green ( 1 mum ) in dmem for 20 min .
for the control experiment , cells loaded with bfa and sa - pnir were resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 4 , 100 mm ) for 10 min .
the cells were visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy .
the intracellular nir signals were merged with lysotracker green and the colocalization is shown by the yellow areas .
bars , 10 mum .
illumination of subcutaneous tumors in mice with sa - pnir shown to fluoresce in lysosomes , sa - pnir was further evaluated for its efficacy and selectivity in illuminating subcutaneous tumors in mice .
nude or icr mice were inoculated subcutaneously with h22 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and then maintained for 5 - 10 days to allow the development of tumor xenografts .
sa - pnir were intravenously administered into the tumor - bearing nude mice via tail vein .
the mice were imaged for whole body nir fluorescence over the course of 144 h after injection .
no nir signal was observed in mice 30 min after administration ( fig. 5 ) , demonstrating that sa - pnir remained silent during circulation in the blood stream ( ph 7.4 ) .
intense nir fluorescence was identified in subcutaneous tumors at 48 h postinjection and the signal contrast between tumor and normal tissues remained high up to 144 h postinjection ( fig. 5 ) .
the tumor - associated fluorescence validates that sa - pnir is effectively accumulated in tumors , where it is activated to the " signal - on " state. fig. 5 time - lapse illumination of subcutaneous tumors with sa - pnir .
nude mice bearing subcutaneous tumors were intravenously injected with sa - pnir ( 40 mg kg - 1 ) via tail vein and then imaged for in vivo nir fluorescence emission at the indicated time points .
to further determine the biodistribution of sa - pnir in subcutaneous tumors and healthy tissues , the tumor and representative organs were dissected from tumor - bearing icr mice pretreated with sa - pnir for 48 h and then probed by ex vivo fluorescence analysis .
consistently , intense signals were observed in the tumor whereas moderate to low levels of nir fluorescence were present in the kidney , heart , spleen , lung and liver ( fig. 6b ) , validating effective tumor uptake and activation of sa - pnir within tumors .
the liver - and kidney - associated nir fluorescence suggests renal and hepatic clearance of injected sa - pnir , which is beneficial for clinical translation .
collectively , these data confirm preferential in vivo tumoral uptake of sa - pnir and ensuing fluorescence activation of sa - pnir , which correlate well with the aforementioned whole body imaging studies ( fig. 5 ). fig. 6 biodistribution of sa - pnir in tumor - bearing mice .
icr mice bearing subcutaneous tumors were intravenously injected with sa - pnir ( 40 mg kg - 1 ) or pbs ( 100 mul ) and then sacrificed 48 h postinjection .
the tumor and representative organs were dissected and then imaged for ex vivo fluorescence emission ( a ) .
the bar graph shows the tissue - specific nir fluorescence intensity ( b ) .
in previous tumor imaging studies , the fluorescence of sa - fitc within tumors reached maxima at 20 min postinjection and then quickly decreased by 80 % at 1 h postinjection.12 the long - term retention of sa - pnir within tumors together with the preferential tumor accumulation of sa - pnir and the high tumor - to - healthy tissue signal ratios suggest the potential utility of sa - pnir for low background intraoperative tumor detection .
to probe the impact of the sialic acid domain of sa - pnir on in vivo tumor targeting , d - glucosamine conjugated with the nir profluorophore ( glu - pnir ) was prepared and then administered into tumor - bearing icr mice via tail vein ( esi +) .
in contrast with mice treated with sa - pnir , whole body imaging revealed no significant nir signal in subcutaneous tumors from mice treated with glu - pnir at 48 and 144 h postinjection ( fig. 7 and s3 , esi +) , demonstrating the critical role of sialic acid for tumor targeting .
historically , monoclonal antibodies , folates , peptides and aptamers have often been used to direct dyes to target tumors.9 the demonstrated high performance tumor illumination with sa - pnir shows that sialic acid with a c - 9 conjugated theranostic entity is an attractive warhead for targetable cancer imaging. fig. 7 sialic acid - mediated tumoral accumulation of sa - pnir in mice .
tumor - bearing icr mice were intravenously injected with sa - pnir or glu - pnir with doses of 7.5 mg kg - 1 ( a ) or 35 mg kg - 1 ( b ) and then imaged 48 h postinjection .
hypersialylation of cell surface glycoconjugates is a hallmark of a broad spectrum of cancers11 and often correlates with their metastatic potentials.17 the tumor - associated over - sialylation suggests enhanced metabolic demand for sa by tumors .
historically , metabolic engineering of cell surface sialosides has been achieved with exogenous n - acyl mannosamines , the metabolic precursor of sa.18 however , this approach is limited by low cell type - or tissue - specificity , as demonstrated by broad expression of metabolically synthesized sa in different tissues from supplemented n - acyl mannosamines in animals.19 in contrast , sa - fitc displays a high tendency to recognize liver tumors in mice.12 albeit preferentially and quickly accumulating in tumors in mice , sa - fitc undergoes quick in vivo clearance , leading to significant fluorescence - off within tumors .
the distinct biomedical properties of sa - pnir as compared to sa - fitc , e.g. long - term tumoral retention , clearly demonstrate the beneficial effects of the pnir moiety on in vivo tumor illumination .
these observations reveal that the in vivo pharmacokinetics of sialic acid - conjugated theranostics could be effectively modulated with substituents of appropriate hydrophobicity ( i.e. pnir vs. fitc ) at the c - 9 position of sialic acid .
cytotoxicity of sa - pnir low toxicity is a prerequisite for imaging agents aimed at in vivo administration .
we first examined the effects of sa - pnir on the survival of hela cells by trypan blue exclusion test .
no obvious detrimental effects on cell viability were observed on cells treated with sa - pnir for 24 h at doses up to 100 mug ml - 1 ( fig. 8 ) , suggesting low cytotoxicity of sa - pnir .
to probe the systemic toxicity , sa - pnir was injected into healthy mice by tail vein at doses of 150 mg kg - 1 .
the mice were regularly monitored for adverse effects following injection .
no signs of abnormality , including death , pain or fatigue , were observed in the probe - treated mice up to 10 days after injection .
ex vivo analysis revealed low levels of nir fluorescence in the organs excised from the mice ( esi ,+ fig. s5 and s6 ) , suggesting that sa - pnir could be effectively cleared from the body .
taken together , these results suggest that sa - pnir is of low biotoxicity. fig. 8 cytotoxicity of sa - pnir .
hela cells were cultured in dmem containing various levels of sa - pnir ( 0 - 100 mug ml - 1 ) for 24 h. cell number and cell viability were determined by trypan blue exclusion assay .
acidic ph dependent photothermal effects of sa - pnir reagents that could convert optical energy into cytotoxic heat are attractive tools for light - mediated photothermal tumor therapy.7 as such , intense investigations have been devoted to the development of various nir - absorbing nanomaterials.7 given long - standing concerns regarding the in vivo biosafety of nanoscaled materials , small molecule theranostics are suitable for in vivo studies , as demonstrated by the approval of indocyanine green dye ( icg ) for clinical applications .
inspired by the emerging use of nir dyes in photothermal therapy,20 we proceeded to examine the capability of sa - pnir as a ph - responsive photothermal agent .
sa - pnir was spiked into buffers of ph 7.5 and 4.5 .
the solutions were exposed to 660 nm laser illumination at a power density of 0.5 w cm - 2 and the temperature of the solutions was monitored over the irradiation time. fig. 9 clearly shows temperature elevation dependent on the acidic ph , demonstrating that sa - pnir effectively converts nir irradiation into heat in acidic media. fig. 9 acidic ph - dependent photothermal properties of sa - pnir .
the temperature of sodium phosphate buffer ( 100 mm , ph 4.5 or 7.5 ) containing sa - pnir ( 0 or 0.1 mg ml - 1 ) was recorded over the time of irradiation with an nir laser ( 660 nm , 0.5 w cm - 2 ) .
sa - pnir mediated photothermal killing of cells sa - pnir was then evaluated for its photothermal effects on host cells .
hela , u87 - mg and raw 264.7 cells pre - loaded with sa - pnir or sa were either irradiated with an nir laser , or not subjected to irradiation .
the viability of these cell populations was assayed using 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2,5 - diphenyltetrazolium ( mtt ) .
cells treated with sa - pnir and light illumination display further decreased viability relative to that of cells treated with nir laser irradiation or sa - pnir alone ( fig. 10 ) , demonstrating the synergistic effects of sa - pnir and light irradiation for detrimental effects on host cells .
sa - pnir has a maximal absorption at 715 nm ( fig. 1 ) .
the molecular extinction coefficient at 715 nm is 2 - fold higher than that at 660 nm. given the suboptimal wavelength used for photothermal evaluation of sa - pnir ( 660 nm , fig. 9 and 10 ) , it can be anticipated that the efficacy of sa - pnir mediated photothermal killing of tumor cells could be further increased with an appropriate instrumental laser ( 715 nm ). fig. 10 photothermal effects of sa - pnir on live cells .
hela , u87 - mg and raw 264.7 cells were cultured for 24 h with sa - pnir ( 0 or 100 mug ml - 1 ) or sa ( 0 or 100 mug ml - 1 ) in dmem and then either irradiated with an nir laser ( 660 nm , 0.5 w cm - 2 ) , or not subjected to irradiation , in fresh dmem for 10 min , and then further cultured for 24 h. cell viability was determined by mtt assay .
complete manual cytoreduction of small - sized or embedded tumor foci is often challenging during surgery .
photothermal tumor ablation during surgery is applicable due to surgical exposure of cancerous tissues that are otherwise inaccessible to exogenous laser irradiation .
theranostics allowing intraoperative tumor staging and simultaneous photothermal tumor therapy are of clinical significance to complement surgical dissection .
the lysosomal acidity - triggered photothermal effect of sa - pnir on targeted cells supports the potential utility of sa - pnir as a theranostic probe for dual imaging and photothermal killing of tumor foci in intraoperative settings .
conclusions sa - pnir , a sialylated lysosome - activatable nir dye , has been developed for intraoperative tumor therapy .
the sialic acid entity enables effective tumor targeting in mice and the nir profluorophore undergoes lysosomal ph - triggered isomerization to give an nir signal .
in contrast with sa - fitc which is compromised by " always - on " green fluorescence and quick in vivo clearance , sa - pnir displays signal activation in viable tumor cells , high tumor - to - normal tissue signal contrasts , and long - term retention in tumors , rendering optical imaging over an adequate duration which is critical for practical surgical intervention .
in addition , sa - pnir effectively converts nir irradiation into heat in acidic lysosomes and leads to obvious cell death upon nir irradiation , suggesting its utility for photothermal ablation of surgically exposed tumor foci that are otherwise inaccessible to exogenous light. with superior in vivo pharmacokinetics , high performance tumor illumination , and acid - responsive photothermal properties , sa - pnir is a promising small molecular theranostic for fluorescence guided tumor detection and possibly photothermal tumor therapy in intraoperative settings .

endophytic bacteria are microorganisms residing in plant tissues without causing disease symptoms .
here , we provide the high - quality genome sequence of curtobacterium sp. strain s6 , isolated from grapevine plant .
the genome assembly contains 2,759,404 bp in 13 contigs and 2,456 predicted genes .
cover - datejuly / august 2014access - typefree genome announcement the genus curtobacterium belongs to the family microbacteriaceae and includes a wide range of bacteria isolated from soil , cheese vat , residential carpet , and plants .
curtobacterium - related strains were isolated as endophytes from sweet - orange , coffee , grapevine , and poplar ( 1 - 4 ) .
some curtobacterium - related bacteria were reported as etiological agents of plant diseases ( 5 ) , while curtobacterium flaccumfaciens protected cucumber plants from pathogens ( 6 ) and led to induced systemic resistance ( isr ) in other plant hosts ( 7 ) .
we sequenced the complete genome of curtobacterium sp. strain s6 , previously isolated as an endophyte from grapevine plant ( 4 ) .
curtobacterium sp. strain s6 was cultivated in luria - bertani ( lb ) liquid medium at 37degreesc overnight .
its genomic dna was extracted using the genelute bacterial genomic dna kit ( sigma - aldrich ) , with some modification .
dna libraries were prepared using the truseq dna sample prep kit ( illumina ) , quality checked by analysis with a bioanalyzer dna high - sensitivity kit , quantified by real - time pcr , and sequenced as 100 - bp paired - end ( x2 ) reads using an illuminahiseq 1000 system within a single lane .
a total of 5.8 gb with 2,099 - fold coverage of the genome was generated from a 400 - bp paired - end ( 100 - nucleotide [ nt ] x2 ) library .
sequenced reads were preprocessed by removing low - quality reads ( undetermined bases > 10 % total length ; > 50 bp with quality score of < 7 ) , clipping adapters ( scythe 0.980 ) ( https :// github.com / vsbuffalo / scythe ) , trimming low - quality read ends ( quality score , < 20 ) , and discarding reads with a final length of < 20 nt ( sickle 0.940 ) ( https :// github.com / najoshi / sickle ) .
genome assembly was performed using soapdenovo2 software ( 8 ) .
the genome assembly contains 2,759,404 bp in 13 contigs ( minimum contig length , 200 bp ; maximum contig length , 1,587,751 bp ) , with an average gc content of 65 % .
gene annotation was performed using the rast server ( 9 ) , revealing 2,456 predicted protein - coding genes .
genes were functionally annotated using blast2go software ( 10 ) .
the curtobacterium sp. strain s6 genome was characterized for the presence of beneficial traits related to plant mineral nutrition ( phosphate solubilization and siderophores ) , development ( indolacetic acid [ iaa ] synthesis ) , stress relief ( 1 - amino - cyclopropane - 1 - carboxylate [ acc ] deaminase and catalase activity ) , and disease control ( chitinase activity and siderophores ) .
in vitro assays showed that curtobacterium sp. strain s6 solubilizes phosphate and produces iaa , and it showed catalase and acc deaminase activity .
despite its biological significance and its possible involvement in plant defense responses against pathogens ( 11 ) , complete genome sequence information for the curtobacterium genus is still limited .
thus , our work may lead to curtobacterium genome - based biotechnological applications for developing sustainable biocontrol strategies against plant diseases .

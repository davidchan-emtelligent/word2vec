background intussusception refers to a condition in which a segment of the intestine invaginates into the lumen of an adjacent segment of the intestine .
postoperative intussusception after gastrointestinal surgery is an uncommon clinical condition , and there is only one case report of small bowel intussusception after rectal cancer surgery .
here , we report a case of spontaneous small bowel intussusception following laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer .
case presentation a 56 - year - old female military officer was referred to the colorectal surgical department for mid - rectal cancer , 8 cm from the anal verge .
the patient underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection and diverting loop ileostomy .
on postoperative day 3 , the patient complained of vomiting and abdominal pain , and a follow - up abdomino - pelvic computed tomography scan showed an ileo - ileal type intussusception .
after two days of surgical observation , her clinical symptoms were not resolved .
the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy .
on exploration , intussusception was found 40 cm proximal to the loop ileostomy site .
segmental resection of the ileum was carried out , and there was no pathological leading point on the resected ileum .
the patient was discharged on postoperative day 14 after the second operation and has remained in good health for two years .
conclusion we present a case of spontaneous small bowel intussusception after laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer that was treated by surgical resection 5 days after the index surgery .

intussusception in pediatrics ranks second to appendicitis as a cause of acute abdominal surgery , and most cases are idiopathic .
however , the incidence of adult intussusception is approximately 5 % of all cases of intussusception , and most cases have an underlying cause , such as malignancy [ 1 ] .
postoperative intussusception after gastrointestinal surgery is an uncommon clinical condition with a reported incidence of less than 0.1 % in patients undergoing gastric resection [ 2 ] , and atolagbe et al .
[ 3 ] recently reported a rare case of retrograde intussusception of the roux limb following laparoscopic roux - en - y gastric bypass surgery .
there is only one case report of small bowel intussusception after rectal cancer surgery [ 4 ] .
here , we report a case of spontaneous small bowel intussusception after laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer .
case presentation a 56 - year - old female military officer was referred to the colorectal surgical department for mid - rectal cancer 8 cm from the anal verge .
the patient had no past medical history .
her physical examination and routine laboratory studies were unremarkable .
her carcinoembryonic antigen level was 5.93 ng / ml , and an abdomino - pelvic computed tomography ( ct ) scan showed no intra - abdominal metastasis .
pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed a clinical t2n0 tumor .
the patient underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection and diverting loop ileostomy .
the operation time was 310 min .
the pathologic results showed that the adenocarcinoma had infiltrated the proper muscle layer ( t2 ) with no lymph node metastasis ( 0 / 17 ) .
on postoperative day 3 , the patient complained of vomiting and abdominal pain , and a follow - up abdomino - pelvic ct scan showed an ileo - ileal type intussusception ( fig. 1 ) .
two days of surgical observation were unsuccessful , and her nausea and abdominal pain continued .
the patient then underwent exploratory laparotomy .
on exploration , intussusception was found 40 cm proximal to the loop ileostomy site .
the proximal ileum ( p , intussusceptum ) had invaginated into the distal segment ( d , intussuscipiens ) , and segmental resection of the ileum was carried out ( fig. 2 ) .
there was no pathological leading point on the resected ileum ( fig. 3 ) .
the patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 14 after the second operation .
the patient has remained in good health for two years. fig. 1 a follow - up abdominal computed tomography ( ct ) scan after laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer on postoperative day 3 .

there was no pathological leading point on the resected ileum conclusions postoperative intussusception is a distinct clinical condition , and in terms of rectal surgery , only one study to date has described small bowel intussusception following laparoscopic low anterior resection , which was in a 75 - year - old man [ 4 ] .
the pathogenesis of postoperative intussusception is unclear , and pathologic examination usually reveals no identifiable cause or pathologic leading point following surgery for the postoperative intussusception [ 5 ] , as in our case .
there are several hypotheses regarding potential causes including extensive handling of the small bowel , prolonged ileus , increased abdominal pressure , peristalsis , and / or fibrous adhesions around the suture site [ 6 ] .
the clinical manifestations are similar to those of postoperative small bowel obstruction .
nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain are frequent symptoms , but a palpable mass and / or currant jelly stools are infrequent [ 5 ] .
it is difficult to differentiate postoperative intussusception from paralytic ileus in patients experiencing mild clinical symptoms such as abdominal discomfort and failure to pass a flatus .
indeed , hussain , et al .
[ 4 ] warned of delayed diagnosis of postoperative intussusception .
their case was diagnosed 22 days after the index surgery because the patient presented with non - specific abdominal symptoms such as obstipation , mild abdominal bloating , and emesis .
in our case , the diagnosis was made on postoperative day 3 , based on ct scans .
intussusception can be diagnosed using imaging studies such as ct or abdominal ultrasonography ( us ) .
given that there is a postoperative abdominal wound , ct may be more useful than us. a us probe may cause severe wound pain , and the surgical wound may disturb the ultrasound [ 7 ] .
thus , to prevent a delay in diagnosis , a high index of suspicion is required during the postoperative period .
once suspected , ct scans can be beneficial for differential diagnosis .
differential diagnosis with paralytic ileus is difficult in patients with small bowel obstruction , but vomiting and abdominal pain are rare in patients with paralytic ileus .
ct scans can reveal whether a complete small bowel obstruction is present .
in addition , adhesion - related obstructions and non - adhesional pathology can be observed on ct scans .
ct estimates the presence of strangulation with sensitivity and specificity over 90 % and a negative predictive value of approximately 100 % [ 8 ] .
the treatment is usually surgical resection .
however , spontaneous reduction has been reported in some cases [ 9 ] .
in our case , two days of surgical observation were not successful , and the patient 's symptoms were not resolved .
given that a natural course of postoperative intussusception is not clearly defined , surgical treatment should be decided upon carefully .
the prognosis is usually excellent unless the patient has a pathologic condition such as polyps or lipoma [ 10 ] .
in our institution , a protective stoma was not routinely constructed .
low - level colorectal anastomosis (< 5 cm from the anal verge ) , the presence of air leakage , and an incomplete donut were the main indications for the de - functioning ileostomy [ 11 ] .
in summary , we present a case of spontaneous small bowel intussusception after laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer that was treated by surgical resection 5 days after the index surgery .

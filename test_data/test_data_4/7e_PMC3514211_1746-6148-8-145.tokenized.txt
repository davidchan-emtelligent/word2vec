background development of a method for long - term labeling of cells is critical to elucidate transplanted cell fate and migration as well as the contribution to tissue regeneration .
silica nanoparticles have been recently developed and demonstrated to be biocompatible with a high labeling capacity .
thus , our study was designed to assess the suitability of silica nanoparticles for labeling canine mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) and the fluorescence afficiency in highly autofluorescent tissue .
results we examined the effect of silica nanoparticle labeling on stem cell morphology , viability and differentiation as compared with those of unlabeled control cells .
after 4 h of incubation with silica nanoparticles , they were internalized by canine mscs without a change in the morphology of cells compared with that of control cells .
the viability and proliferation of mscs labeled with silica nanoparticles were evaluated by a wst - 1 assay and trypan blue exclusion .
no effects on cell viability were observed , and the proliferation of canine mscs was not inhibited during culture with silica nanoparticles .
furthermore , adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of silica nanoparticle - labeled canine mscs was at a similar level compared with that of unlabeled cells , indicating that silica nanoparticle labeling did not alter the differentiation capacity of canine mscs .
silica nanoparticle - labeled canine mscs were injected into the kidneys of balb / c mice after celiotomy , and then the mice were sacrificed after 2 or 3 weeks .
the localization of injected mscs was closely examined in highly autofluorescent renal tissues .
histologically , canine mscs were uniformly and completely labeled with silica nanoparticles , and were unambiguously imaged in histological sections .
conclusions the results of the current study showed that silica nanoparticles are useful as an effective labeling marker for mscs , which can elucidate the distribution and fate of transplanted mscs .
background adult mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) are a cellular tool with promising application in both veterinary and human medicine .
mscs have the potential to repair tissues [ 1 - 4 ] and improve the function of damaged organs .
thus , many clinical trials are in progress to evaluate the therapeutic potentials of mscs for treating renal failure , diabetes mellitus and heart failure [ 5 - 9 ] .
tracking of stem cells is essential for evaluating cell replacement and therapeutic strategies [ 10 ] .
in addition , long - term labeling of stem cells is critical to elucidate their fate , migration , and contribution to regenerating tissues .
conventional labeling methods used in cell and developmental biology include bromodeoxyuridine , chloromethyl dye , fluorescent in situ hybridization , 4 ' - 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( dapi ) , and green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) .
however , these conventional labeling methods have limitations for use in labeling of stem cells [ 9,11 ] .
labeling methods using chemicals may affect stem cell functions [ 7 ] , and most fail to fluoresce for a long period owing to photobleaching [ 12 ] .
moreover , secondary staining is sometimes needed for amplifying fluorescence to identify transplanted cells in tissue sections , and these protocols may produce false - positive results [ 7,13 ] .
to overcome these issues , different kinds of nanomaterials have been created to track stem cells .
silica is a suitable nanomaterial for bifunctional or multifunctional cellular labeling because it is biocompatible , resistant to biodegradation in cellular environments and can be easily functionalized for bioconjugation [ 14,15 ] .
nanoparticles are coated with a shell of silica to avoid potential toxic effects .
the silica shell contains luminescent organic dyes ( ods ) such as rhodamine b isothiocyanate ( ritc ) or fluorescein isothiocyanate , resulting in a fluorescent and magnetic nanomaterial .
in particular , incorporated ods are more available than commercial od products owing to their resistance to photobleaching .
because silica is stable under strong basic and acidic conditions , the fluorescent properties also remain stable [ 16 ] .
in addition , many approaches involve endocytosis that contributes to higher uptake and retention of silica nanoparticles in mscs [ 14,17 ] .
however , no study has investigated the effects of silica nanoparticles as a labeling reagent for mscs .
therefore , we examined whether silica nanoparticles affected cell viability and the differentiation potential of mscs , and evaluated the fluorescence efficiency in highly autofluorescent renal tissues .
results mscs internalize silica nanoparticles and maintain typical msc morphology as shown in figure 1 , silica nanoparticles were taken up by cells , and concentrated fluorescence was observed inside canine mscs with increasing incubation time .
after 4 h of incubation , silica nanoparticles were visible in the cytoplasm of mscs at labeling concentrations of 200 and 400 mug / ml. using sufficient concentrations , silica nanoparticles were completely internalized by mscs within 4 h ( figure 1 ) .
thus , we used 200 mug / ml silica nanoparticles for subsequent experiments .
figure 1 optimal concentration and incubation time of silica nanoparticles for labeling of mscs .
ucbmscs were incubated for more than 4 h with 200 or 400 mug / ml silica nanoparticles , which yielded visible fluorescent signals .
however , no effective fluorescence occurred at 100 mug / ml. the majority of cells showed cytoplasmic fluorescence after 4 h of incubation .
magnification , x400 .
the morphology of canine umbilical cord blood ( ucb ) mscs and adipose tissue - derived ( at ) mscs was typical with fibroblastoid and spindle shapes , and the cells remained adherent ( figure 2b , h ) .
after 4 h of incubation , silica nanoparticles were internalized by canine atmscs and ucbmscs ( figure 2d , j ) without altering the morphology of cells ( figure 2e , i ) , compared with that of control cells .
the overlay ( merged ) images revealed co - localization of fluorescent cells in paired differential interference contrast ( dic ) images ( figure 2c , f , i , l ) .

silica nanoparticles were internalized after 4 h of incubation with canine atmscs and ucbmscs ( c , h ) .
labeled canine mscs ( c , d ) spread well on the dish , and showed fibroblastoid and spindle shapes .
no notable differences in morphology were observed compared with that of unlabeled canine mscs ( a , b ) .

silica nanoparticles do not affect canine msc viability or proliferation to evaluate potential cytotoxicity of silica nanoparticles in canine mscs , a wst - 1 assay , which measures cell viability relative to the metabolic activity , was performed after culturing the cells with the nanoparticles for 24 h. figure 3a shows the effect of silica nanoparticles on the viability and metabolic activity of canine mscs .
the percentage of viable canine mscs was not significantly different in the presence of increasing concentrations of silica nanoparticles , and was not significantly different from that of the control ( p > 0.05 , analysis of variance ) .
figure 3 determination of cell viability and proliferation in the presence of silica nanoparticles for labeling of canine mscs .
( a ) canine mscs were incubated without ( control ) or with 100 , 200 , 300 , or 400 mug / ml silica nanoparticles ( np ) for 24 h , and then cell viability was measured by a wst - 1 assay .
no significant differences in metabolic activity were observed compared with that of the control during culture with silica nanoparticles .
each concentration was assayed in triplicate .
( b , c ) trypan blue exclusion showed that the proliferation of canine mscs was not inhibited .
no significant differences in cell number were observed compared with that of the control during culture with silica nanoparticles .
each concentration was evaluated in triplicate .
data are the means +/ - standard deviations ( p > 0.05 , analysis of variance ) .
because the wst - 1 assay does not distinguish between the induction of cell death and the inhibition of proliferation , cell viability was measured by counting cells using trypan blue exclusion following exposure of the cells to silica nanoparticles .
silica nanoparticles at concentrations of 100 , 200 , 300 and 400 mug / ml had no significant effect on the cell viability of canine mscs and their proliferation ( figure 3b , c ) .
this result indicates that the presence of nanoparticles did not interfere with the viability or proliferation of canine mscs .
silica nanoparticles do not inhibit the differentiation potential of canine mscs to assess the effect of silica nanoparticles on canine msc differentiation , silica nanoparticle - labeled canine atmscs and ucbmscs were cultured for 3 weeks under adipogenic and osteogenic induction conditions .
strong staining of oil red o or alizarin red s can interfere with the red fluorescence even in fluoroscope , we induced respectively for examination of oil red o or alizarin red s staining and red fluorescence .
adipogenic induction of canine mscs labeled with silica nanoparticles resulted in expanded cell morphology .
staining with intracellular oil red o , a commonly used lipid dye ( figure 4 ) , indicated that lipids had accumulated within the cells in small vacuoles , which appeared as droplets in canine atmscs and ucbmscs .
adipogenic differentiation of silica nanoparticle - labeled canine atmscs and ucbmscs was at a similar level as that of unlabeled cells .
however , lipid accumulation in ucbmscs was lower than that in atmscs , because of the canine ucbmsc characteristics [ 18 ] .
when mscs underwent osteogenic differentiation , they proliferated rapidly and formed tightly packed colonies .
cells were then stained with alizarin red s to assess mineralization ( figure 5 ) .
osteogenic differentiation of canine atmscs and ucbmscs labeled with nanoparticles occurred at a similar level as that of unlabeled cells .
using a fluoroscope , differentiated mscs labeled with silica nanoparticles showed cytoplasmic retention of fluorescence ( figures 4 and 5 ) .
these results show that adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of canine mscs was not inhibited by silica nanoparticles .

ucbmscs and atmscs were cultured in adipogenic differentiation medium for 21 days .
cells were then stained with oil red o. red lipid droplets were visible in ucbmscs and atmscs , indicating adipogenic differentiation .

mscs labeled with silica nanoparticles are unambiguously detected in renal tissue approximately 2 x 105 mscs labeled with silica nanoparticles were injected into a mouse kidney after celiotomy .
all treated mice remained healthy and gained weight normally .
mice were sacrificed after 2 or 3 weeks , and the gross appearance of the kidneys was normal except for mild hemorrhaging in the renal capsule at the injection site .
histological sections ( 4 mum thick ) of renal tissue were prepared and examined for fluorescence .
the renal cortex and medullary region were necrotic owing to the injection , which caused mechanical injury ( figure 6c ) .
silica nanoparticle - labeled mscs were found predominantly in the corticomedullary and medullary regions that mainly consist of the proximal and distal tubules and the loop of henle ( figure 6a ) .
co - localization of fluorescent silica nanoparticles and dapi nuclear staining was observed ( figure 6b ) .
this result indicates that silica nanoparticle - labeled mscs were easily tracked , and silica nanoparticle fluorescence remained in canine mscs for more than 3 weeks .

discussion our study demonstrated that canine mscs can be effectively labeled by incubation with silica nanoparticles without impairing the cell morphology , viability or metabolic activity .
in addition , silica nanoparticle - labeled mscs exhibited a similar level of differentiation into adipocytes and osteocytes compared with that of unlabeled mscs .
moreover , silica nanoparticle - labeled mscs were uniformly visualized in the kidney at more than 3 weeks after transplantation .
these results demonstrate obvious benefits compared with other nanomaterials .
recently developed quantum dots show strong luminance and high photostability compared with those of conventional organic fluorophores [ 19 ] .
however , the toxic potential of cadmium nanoparticles has remained a concern [ 20 ] .
boddington et al. reported [ 21 ] that the iron oxide nanoparticle ferucarbotran may impair msc differentiation , which hinders their potential use as fluorescence tracers for stem cells .
in contrast , the toxicological effects of amorphous silica have been characterized reasonably well , and this form has been found to be less toxic in animal experiments than that of other nanomaterials .
although some studies suggest that inhaling of materials such as colloidal silica by mice induces dose and size - dependent pulmonary effects [ 22,23 ] , silica nanoparticles demonstrate no apparent toxicity in mice when injected via the tail vein [ 24 ] .
similarly , the safety of silica nanoparticles was confirmed in our study .
the viability of unlabeled and silica nanoparticles - labeled cells , as measured by the wst - 1 assay and trypan blue exclusion , was not significantly different , suggesting that silica nanoparticles are cytocompatible and do not induce cell death .
moreover , the differentiation capacity of mscs toward multiple cell lineages was not affected by silica nanoparticle labeling .
labeled mscs showed similar elaboration of mineralized matrix and accumulation of lipid droplets , compared with those of unlabeled mscs during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation , respectively .
we also demonstrated that silica nanoparticle - labeled mscs can be histologically located in the kidney and tracked .
endocytosed silica nanoparticles persisted in expanded canine mscs for up to 3 weeks .
this 3 week period was sufficient for transplanted mscs to migrate and differentiate in the host tissue .
furthermore , the fluorescence was not weakened until 3 weeks after transplantation .
in contrast , superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles show significant decreases in fluorescence after 1 month [ 25 ] .
such long - term labeling of stem cells will be beneficial for elucidating the relative contributions of native and engineered tissues to morphogenesis .
furthermore , silica nanoparticles can be imaged in renal tissue without additional staining .
the kidney is a highly autofluorescent tissue owing to its extremely high metabolic rate , accumulation of flavins and lipofuscins , and vascularization [ 26 ] .
tissue autofluorescence has long posed a problem for studies of immunofluorescence labeling , and particularly for direct staining .
because it has been difficult to reduce autofluorescence in tissues , efficient labeling methods should be used to overcome this issue .
we demonstrated that silica nanoparticles can be used as a reliable long - term tracking agent in autofluorescent tissues .
thus , we believe that this labeling method can track transplanted cells for extended periods in other autofluorescent tissues ( e.g. , liver , and pancreas ) .
we used an invasive method of injecting directly into the renal cortex after celiotomy to infuse stem cells into the kidney .
after the abdominal incision surgery , the mice recovered immediately and gained weight normally , and no other complications were observed .
abdominal incisions can mobilize leukocytes and neutrophils to surgical areas , which is usually normalized within 7 days .
in addition , we administrated broad - spectrum antibiotics to prevent infection from the surgery .
therefore , we believe that the effect of surgery on the mice and transplanted mscs was insignificant .
renal tissues exhibited mechanical damage as shown by hemorrhaging and mild necrosis after the injection .
the injury site may have been exposed to a number of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines owing to tissue inflammation .
this microenvironment may be activated to enhance the homing of stem cells to these sites [ 27 ] .
in the case of systemic msc infusion , although some transplanted cells are located in the pathogenic area , most cells are trapped in the liver or enter systemic circulation [ 25 ] .
in contrast , the detection rate of mscs following intra - renal injection is much higher ( 20 - 50 %) than that following systemic injection [ 28 ] .
thus , we chose direct renal injection to avoid systemic circulation of labeled mscs , and most mscs were observed in the corticomedullary junction and the medullary region at 2 or 3 weeks after injection ( figure 6 ) .
the medullary region consists of the proximal and distal tubules and the loop of henle , in which the main functions involve regulation of water and electrolyte reabsorption .
we presume that mscs gradually moved to the damaged tubular regions and participated in tissue reconstitution .
this relationship between msc migration and their therapeutic effect needs further investigation .
in any case , we expect that silica nanoparticle labeling will help elucidate the distribution and fate of transplanted mscs .
frangioni et al .
[ 29 ] reported the following criteria to show that an ideal agent for tracking stem cells must ( 1 ) be biocompatible and safe ; ( 2 ) not require any genetic modification or perturbation of the stem cells ; ( 3 ) permit single cell detection in any anatomical location ; ( 4 ) allow quantification of cell number ; ( 5 ) have minimal or no dilution following cell division ; ( 6 ) have minimal or no transfer to non - stem cells ; ( 7 ) permit non - invasive imaging in the living subject over months to years ; and ( 8 ) require no injectable contrast agent for visualization .
our study demonstrated that silica nanoparticles satisfied most of these criteria .
however , we used only one cell line each for ucbmscs and atmscs .
multiple cell lines will need to be tested with silica nanoparticles because of possible differences among cell lines .
based on our study , we suggest that silica nanoparticles represent a viable approach for labeling and tracking of mscs .
conclusions our data demonstrate that silica nanoparticles uniformly and completely label canine mscs in a biocompatible manner , resulting in unambiguous imaging with long - term persistence , even in highly autofluorescent tissues .
fluorescent silica nanoparticles are useful for labeling cells and may help identify the molecular mechanisms of mscs , thereby contributing to the development of therapeutic methods .

introduction the concept of immune contexture is mainly emerged based on studies that are mostly performed with human colorectal cancer ( crc ) [ 1 ] .
study of pages et al. showed that high density of intratumoral memory t cells was closely associated with the disease free time and overall survival rate of crc patients [ 2 ] .
in addition to the findings in crc , becht and his colleagues also proved the beneficial effect of high densities of t cells with a th1 orientation and of cytotoxic cd8 + t cells in non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) [ 3 , 4 ] .
therefore , harnessing the immune system of cancer patients ( immunotherapy in oncology ) has been proposed as promising therapeutic approach for treatment of types of cancers .
generally , the immune system can prevent the development and progression of cancer through a mechanism called immune surveillance .
however , once the process of immune surveillance fails due to variable causable factors [ 5 ] , it will lead to the immune selection of tumor cell variants with reduced immunogenicity and allow progression of tumors [ 6 , 7 ] .
currently , it is commonly recognized that functioning of an effective immunotherapy majorly depends on the roles of immune cells playing in the development of tumors , especially those with antigen presentation capability , that is , dendritic cells ( dcs ) [ 8 ] , and those with cytolytic activity , that is , cytotoxicity t lymphocytes ( ctls ) [ 9 ] .
thus , efficient induction of antitumor immunity via dc - based methods is emerging in recent decades [ 10 - 12 ] .
however , induced maturation of dc by microbial products ( such as lps ) or inflammatory cytokines ( such as tnf ) [ 13 - 15 ] is toxic and application limited .
therefore , exploration of nontoxic vehicles that are capable of inducing dc maturation and immunogenicity is imperative .
lycium barbarum l. is a well - recognized east asia herbal medicine used for treatment and prevention of disease such as insomnia , liver dysfunction , diabetes , visual degeneration , and cancer [ 16 ] .
the bioactivity of lycium barbarum l. is mainly attributed to its polysaccharide - protein complex [ 17 - 19 ] .
the major component of lycium barbarum polysaccharide ( lbp ) consists of six monosaccharides ( galactose , glucose , rhamnose , arabinose , mannose , and xylose ) and 18 amino acids [ 16 ] .
recent studies infer that lbp can also enhance the immune function of patients [ 18 , 19 ] .
verified by several studies , administration of lbp can induce the phenotypic and functional maturation and immunogenicity of dcs as well as activating t lymphocytes [ 16 , 20 , 21 ] .
nevertheless , even with the confirmation of the potency of lbp in promoting efficiency of immunotherapy , the underlying mechanism through which lbp modulates the function of dcs and ctls remains unrevealed .
thus , in the current study , the impact of lbp on the phenotype , maturation , and immunogenicity of dcs isolated from mice was investigated .
to reveal the pathways involved in the regulating effect of lbp on dcs , the expression of notch pathway members was quantified .
the notch pathway is reported to be a key signaling transduction in the differentiation of dcs [ 22 , 23 ] .
thereafter , the influence of lbp on cytotoxicity of dc - mediated ctls to ct26 - wt colon cells was further assessed .
findings outlined in the current study showed that administration of lbp promoted the maturation and immunogenicity of dcs via notch signaling , which strengthened the cytotoxicity of dc - mediated ctls to tumor cells .

3. results 3.1 .
morphology and surface antibody characteristics of dcs morphology of dcs was shown in figure 1 ( a ) .
three days after culture , dcs were grown from confluence into suspension .
thereafter , cell colonies were formed by cells with processes on the surface .
seven days after culture , cells were characterized by long dendrites which are typical features of dcs. by employing flow cytometry , the antibodies presented on the surface of the cells were also detected .
the administration of lbp further increased the expression of the two antibodies on the cell surface , and the effect was both dose - and time - dependent : with 48 h administration of 100 mug lbp had the strongest inducing effect ( figures 1 ( b ) and 1 ( c ) ; figure s1 , in supplementary material available online at https :// doi.org / 10.1155 / 2018 / 2305683 ) .
therefore , the subsequent assays were performed by incubating dcs with 100 mug lbp for 48 h. the results showed that the dcs were successfully induced from bmcs and that lbp could further promote the maturation process .
3.2 .
administration of lbp induced the production of il - 12 and suppressed the production of il - 10 as well as tgf - beta the levels of il - 10 and tgf - beta in the supernatants of dcs were decreased by administration of lbp , and the differences between dc and lbp groups were statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) ( figures 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b )) .
in contrast , the levels of il - 12 in the supernatants of dcs were significantly increased ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 2 ( c )) .
3.3 .
administration of lbp initiated notch signaling in dcs to uncover the mechanism which drives the function of lbp on dcs , the expression of notch and jagged was detected both at mrna and at protein levels .
the expression of targets of notch , including hes1 and hes5 , was detected with rt2 - pcr .
it was found that incubation with lbp enhanced the expression of all indicators ( figures 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b )) .
given the fact that notch signaling is crucial to the differentiation of dcs , the results of molecular detection confirmed the conclusion that lbp was capable of inducing the differentiation of dcs as illustrated by morphology and antibodies expression detection , which depended on notch signaling activation .
3.4 .
administration of lbp strengthened the cytotoxicity of dc - mediated ctls on colon cancer cell ct26 - wt ctls were successfully induced by dc incubation and the cytotoxicity characteristics of dc - mediated ctls were even strengthened by administration of lbp : the proportion of cd3 + cd8 + cells significantly increased after being subjected to lbp for 4 days ( 54.5 +/ - 4.26 versus 80.9 +/ - 7.93 ) ( figure 4 ( a )) .
moreover , the production of ifn - gamma by ctls was also augmented by administration of lbp , representing the promising potential of lbp to promote immunologic cytotoxicity ( figure 4 ( b )) .
as a result , the cytotoxicity of ctls on ct26 - wt cells was increased : the total apoptotic rates of ct26 - wt cell in lbp treated group and the nk activity of lbp treated ctls were significantly increased compared with normal ctls ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 5 ) .
additionally , effector - target ratio also served as a factor that influenced the cytotoxicity of ctls : although no significant difference was detected between effector - target ratios 10 : 1 and 20 : 1 , the apoptotic rate and nk activity in 40 : 1 group were dramatically higher than the other two groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
4. discussion the application of natural compounds as potential improvements for human health keeps increasing in popularity in recent years .
since ancient years , oriental herbal medicine has been used for treatment of malignancy in eastern countries .
lbp , which is the biologically active compounds of lycium barbarum l. , is proved to have biological activities such as anticancer , antioxidant , hypoglycemic , and immunological activities [ 24 - 26 ] .
previous studies have shown that administration of lbp induces cell cycle arrest in colon cancer [ 27 ] and promotes the maturation of dcs as well as increasing cytotoxicity of ctls [ 16 , 20 , 21 ] .
the findings of the previous studies took a step further in the current study : after confirming the inducing effect of lbp on dcs , the mechanism involved in the function of lbp on dcs and its effect on dc - mediated ctl cytotoxicity on tumor cells were also explored .
our results showed that lbp treatment activated the notch signaling in dcs , representing the pathway through which lbp promoted dcs maturation .
moreover , the effect of lbp on the production of il - 10 , il - 12 , and tgf - beta might explain the mechanism driving the lbp function on activation and function differentiation of ctls .
it was demonstrated in the current study that lbp treatment upregulated the expression of cd80 and cd86 on bmc derived dcs , suggesting that lbp induced the phenotypic maturation of dcs .
moreover , lbp also promoted function maturation of dcs , which was validated by the augmented production of il - 12 and suppressed production of il - 10 and tgf - beta .
il - 12 is a functional dc maturation marker with a molecular mass of 70 kda , which is a potent ifn - gamma inducer for ctls [ 28 , 29 ] .
to the contrary , il - 10 and tgf - beta mediate active suppression of specific t lymphocytes responses as an essential mechanism in immune response [ 30 ] .
the increased il - 12 and decreased il - 10 and tgf - beta , along with the enhanced dc activation by lbp treatment , would promote the ifn - gamma - secreting t cell differentiation following t cell activation [ 9 ] .
indeed , in elsia assay , the production of ifn - gamma was significantly upregulated .
previous studies have demonstrated that ifn - gamma + ctls are critical for antitumor immunotherapies [ 9 ] .
therefore , the enhanced dc activation and higher frequency of ifn - gamma + ctls evidently indicated that lbp was a promising adjuvant therapeutic modality along with immunotherapies .
the pathway through which lbp exerted its function on dc maturation was also preliminarily investigated in the current study .
it was found that administration of lbp would induce the activation of notch signaling .
the differentiation of dc is modulated via a network of soluble and cell - bound factors in stroma [ 22 ] .
notch signaling is one of the most major components of the process .
generally , notch signaling is initiated upon the binding of the extracellular domain of notch receptors to notch ligands : jagged and delta. with regard to dc differentiation , function of notch signaling is exerted through its cooperation with wnt pathways [ 22 ] .
then the activated wnt pathway will result in sustained upregulation of il - 12 [ 31 ] .
however , the inhibition of il - 10 and tgf - beta associated with the activated notch signaling is confusing in that the activation of notch signaling in dcs always induces the production of il - 10 by th1 cells. and activated wnt signaling due to notch activation is also reported to upregulate tgf - beta signaling during myofibroblast differentiation [ 32 - 34 ] .
subjecting dcs to lbp in the current study seemed to lead to a contrary conclusion to previous studies , which made it hard to evidently elaborate the mechanism through which lbp affected dc maturation and cytokines secretion .
given that the activated notch signaling was associated with decreased il - 10 and tgf - beta , it was likely that the modulating effect of lbp on dcs comprised more complicated pathways as we had expected in the first place .
5. conclusions being widely used as an injection in clinical patients in china to improve immune functions , lbp has showed its promising potential for further exploration as an effective adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy .
in the current study , administration of lbp not only induced the phenotypic and functional maturation of dcs but also promoted the cytotoxicity of dc - mediated ctls .
we also attempted to preliminarily study the pathways involved in the effect of lbp on dc , but the activated notch signaling due to lbp treatment introduced more questions to the mechanism related to lbp function on dcs .
to comprehensively understand the effect of lbp on immune responses , more work will be needed in the future .

prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men and shows a predilection for metastasis to distant organs .
bradykinin ( bk ) is an inflammatory mediator and has recently been shown to mediate tumor growth and metastasis .
the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( icam - 1 ) plays a critical role during tumor metastasis .
the aim of this study was to examine whether bk promotes prostate cancer cell migration via icam - 1 expression .
the motility of cancer cells was increased following bk treatment .
stimulation of prostate cancer cells with bk induced mrna and protein expression of icam - 1 .
transfection of cells with icam - 1 small interfering rna reduced bk - increased cell migration .
pretreatment of prostate cancer cells with b2 receptor , phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) , akt , and activator protein 1 ( ap - 1 ) inhibitors or mutants abolished bk - promoted migration and icam - 1 expression .
in addition , treatment with a b2 receptor , pi3k , or akt inhibitor also reduced bk - mediated ap - 1 activation .
our results indicate that bk enhances the migration of prostate cancer cells by increasing icam - 1 expression through a signal transduction pathway that involves the b2 receptor , pi3k , akt , and ap - 1 .
thus , bk represents a promising new target for treating prostate cancer metastasis .
bradykinin migration icam - 1 prostate cancer 1 .
introduction prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the usa and other western countries [ 1 ] .
surgical treatment alone ( i.e. , radical prostatectomy ) often successfully improves the prognoses of patients at early stages of prostate cancer and it is the most frequent therapeutic intervention .
as in many cancers , systemic interventions to inhibit the growth and spread of secondary metastasis are necessary for the treatment of advanced patients with disease state [ 2 ] .
the complex and multi - stage process of formation of secondary tumors at distant sites , called metastasis , is the major cause of mortality in cancer patients [ 3 ] .
typically , several steps are involved in the metastasis process , including cellular transformation and tumor growth , angiogenesis , lymphangiogenesis , entry of cancer cells in the circulation by intravasation , invasion of the target organ by extravasation , anchorage and / or attachment to the target organ , and proliferation within the organ parenchyma [ 4 ] .
the relationship between the migration activity of cancer cells and many of these steps is close and , therefore correlated with tumor metastasis .
the inducible surface glycoprotein intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( icam - 1 , also called cd54 ) belongs to the immunoglobulin supergene family and mediates adhesion - dependent cell - to - cell interactions [ 5 - 7 ] .
the extracellular domain of icam - 1 is crucial for leukocytes and has been shown to be correlated with the transendothelial migration of leukocytes from the capillary bed to the surrounding tissue [ 8 ] .
icam - 1 may also promote the migration of other cell types [ 9 - 11 ] .
previous studies have shown that icam - 1 is involved in breast and lung cancer cell invasion [ 12,13 ] .
knockdown of the icam - 1 expression decreased the invasive activity of breast cancer cells [ 12 ] .
thus , icam - 1 may play a critical role in tumorigenesis , and determining the critical role of icam - 1 disruption may prevent cancer cell metastasis in disease development .
bradykinin ( bk ) will be produced immediately in case of inflammation or injury [ 14 ] .
it is known that levels of bk may mediate many types of proinflammatory effects , including the contraction of smooth muscles , eicosanoid synthesis , enhanced vascular permeability , vasodilation , and the release of neuropeptides [ 14,15 ] .
the effects of bk are mediated via 2g - protein - coupled receptors , b1 and b2 , which have been pharmacologically characterized and defined by molecular cloning [ 16,17 ] .
several recent studies indicated that bk can promote proliferation , invasion , and migration in different cell types via bk receptors , suggesting that bk receptors play critical roles in tumor metastasis [ 18 - 20 ] .
interestingly , the b2 receptor , rather than the b1 receptor , is commonly involved in most biological actions that are bk - mediated [ 20,21 ] .
previous studies have reported that bk mediated the invasion and migration of human cancer cells [ 19,22 ] .
we reported previously that bk promotes migration of human prostate cancer cells through up - regulation of matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) - 9 [ 23 ] .
here , we further examined whether icam - 1 expression is involved in bk - mediated motility of human prostate cancer cells .
our results suggest that bk enhanced cell migratory ability and icam - 1 expression in human prostate cancer cells .
furthermore , bk - mediated cell migratory ability and icam - 1 expression may be regulated via the b2 receptor , pi3k , akt , c - jun , and ap - 1 signaling pathways .
2. results 2.1 .
involvement of icam - 1 up - regulation in bradykinin promotes cell motility we previously reported that bk increases cell migration of prostate cancer cells by using a transwell assay [ 23 ] .
in this study , the motility of prostate cancer cells was examined by using wound - healing migration and transwell migration assays .
stimulation of human prostate cancer cells ( pc3 , du145 , and lncap cells ) with bk promoted wound - healing migration activity ( figure 1a,b ) .
icam - 1 activation has been reported to mediate prostate cancers motility [ 24,25 ] .
therefore , we hypothesized that icam - 1 may be also involved in the bk - induced migratory ability of human prostate cancer cells .
incubation of cells with bk increased the mrna and protein expressions of icam - 1 dose dependently ( figure 1c,d ) .
to confirm that icam - 1 plays an important role in bk - induced cell migration , icam - 1 sirna was used .
transfection of cells with icam - 1 sirna blocked icam - 1 expression and bk - mediated cell migration , which was demonstrated in wound - healing and transwell assays ( figure 1e,f ) .
therefore , these results indicate that icam - 1 up - regulation is involved in bk - promoted cell migration of human prostate cancer cells .
2.2 .
involvement of the b2 receptor in bk - mediated migration and icam - 1 up - regulation of human prostate cancer cells it has been reported that the expression of b2 is associated with a metastatic phenotype of prostate cancer cell lines [ 23 ] .
therefore , we investigated whether the b2 receptor mediates bk - induced prostate cancer cell migration and icam - 1 expression .
pretreatment of cells with the b2 receptor antagonist hoe140 abolished bk - mediated cell migration ( figure 2a ) .
to further confirm the role of the b2 receptor in bk - mediated motility , b2 specific sirna was used .
the protein level of the b2 receptor and bk - mediated cell migration decreased when cells were transfected with sirna against the b2 receptor ( figure 2b ) .
furthermore , pretreatment of cells with hoe140 or transfection with b2 receptor sirna also reduced the bk - mediated expression of icam - 1 ( figure 2c - e ) .
next , we examined the expression of b1 receptor in human prostate cancer cell lines .
we found that all three prostate cancer cell lines expressed the b1 receptor ( figure 2f ) .
however , transfection of pc3 cells with b1 sirna did not affect bk - induced cell migration ( figure 2g ) , suggesting that b1 is involved in bk - mediated cell motility .
therefore , the bk / b2 interaction is involved in cell migration and icam - 1 expression in human prostate cancer cells .
2.3 .
pi3k and akt signaling pathways are involved in bk - induced cell migration and icam - 1 expression pi3k / akt activation has been reported to occur in bk - mediated cell functions [ 26,27 ] .
to examine whether pi3k is involved in bk - induced cell migration , the pi3k inhibitor ly294002 was used .
pretreatment of cells with the pi3k inhibitor ly294002 blocked bk - mediated migration and icam - 1 expression ( figure 3a - d ) .
to confirm the role of pi3k in bk - mediated motility , we transfected cells with a p85 mutant , which also reduced bk - increased cell migration and expression of icam - 1 ( figure 3a - c,e ) .
direct incubation of cells with bk increased the phosphorylation of p85 ( figure 3f ) .
the pi3k - dependent signaling pathway causes enzymatic activation of akt via phosphorylation at ser473 residue [ 28 ] .
we next examined whether pi3k - dependent akt activation is involved in bk - induced cell migration and icam - 1 expression .
pretreatment of cells with akt inhibitor or transfection of cells with akt mutant antagonized bk - promoted cell migration and icam - 1 expression ( figure 4a - e ) .
in addition , treatment of pc3 cells with bk promoted akt ser473 phosphorylation time dependently .
our data suggest that bk increases the expression of icam - 1 and cell motility through pi3k and akt signaling pathways in human prostate cancer cells .
2.4 .
ap - 1 is involved in bk - mediated migration and icam - 1 expression a previous study has shown that ap - 1 activation mediates icam - 1 expression and metastasis in human prostate cancer cells [ 29 ] .
to examine whether ap - 1 activation is involved in the signal transduction pathway leading to bk - induced increased icam - 1 expression and cell motility , the ap - 1 inhibitor curcumin [ 30 ] was used .
curcumin antagonized the increase in the migration and icam - 1 expression induced by bk ( figure 5a - d ) .
ap - 1 activation was further evaluated by analyzing c - jun activation .
transfection of cells with c - jun sirna reduced the bk - mediated increase in cell migration and icam - 1 expression ( figure 5a - c,e ) .
stimulation of cells with bk increased c - jun phosphorylation ( figure 5f ) .
furthermore , pretreatment of cells with ly294002 or an akt inhibitor reduced the bk - induced c - jun phosphorylation ( figure 5g ) .
these data indicate that ap - 1 is involved in bk - mediated cell migration and expression of icam - 1 in human prostate cancer cells .
the in vivo recruitment of c - jun to the icam - 1 promoter was assessed via a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay [ 31 ] .
in vivo binding of c - jun to the ap - 1 element of the icam - 1 promoter occurred after bk stimulation ( figure 6a ) .
the binding of c - jun to the ap - 1 element in the presence of bk was reduced by hoe140 , ly294002 , or an akt inhibitor ( figure 6a ) .
stimulation of cells with bk also increased c - jun translocation to the nucleus ( figure 6b ) .
in addition , pretreatment of cells with hoe140 , ly294002 , or an akt inhibitor decreased bk - induced c - jun translocation ( figure 6b ) .
furthermore , bk increased ap - 1 luciferase activity , which was used as an indicator of ap - 1 activation ( figure 6c ) .
pretreatment of cells with hoe140 , ly294002 , an akt inhibitor , or curcumin antagonized the bk - mediated ap - 1 - luciferase activity ( figure 6c ) .
in addition , the bk - induced increase in ap - 1 - luciferase activity was also abolished by co - transfection of cells with p85 and akt mutants or b2 and c - jun sirnas ( figure 6d ) .
therefore , the b2 receptor , pi3k , and akt are upstream molecules for the bk - mediated activation of ap - 1 in human prostate cancer cells .
3. discussion a characteristic of prostate cancer cells is their striking tendency to undergo metastasis [ 3,32 ] .
a analysis of trophic signals that control metastasis of prostate cancer is crucial for the identification of new molecular targets for anti - metastasis therapies .
we previously reported that bk promotes cell migration of human prostate cancer cells through mmp - 9 expression [ 23 ] .
in this study , we further investigated whether icam - 1 up - regulation is also involved in bk - promoted cell motility of human prostate cancer cells .
here , we reported that bk enhanced cell migration and icam - 1 expression of human prostate cancer cells .
one of the mechanisms underlying bk - mediated migration is activation of the b2 receptor , pi3k , akt , and ap - 1 signaling pathways .
it has been reported that mmp - 9 cleaves icam - 1 and participates in tumor cell resistance to natural killer cell - mediated cytotoxicity [ 33 ] .
in the current study , we did not examine whether mmp - 9 also cleaved icam - 1 in bk - mediated cell motility of prostate cancer cells .
therefore , whether mmp - 9 degrades icam - 1 after bk stimulation is needs further examination .
recently , bk has been reported to mediate the invasion and migration of human cancer cells [ 19,22 ] .
here , we exogenously applied bk to prostate cancer cell lines and observed induced cell motility .
exogenously applied bk is representative of the in vitro endocrine effect of bk. previous studies used bk ( 3 - 10 nm ) as a pathological condition [ 20,34 ] .
in the current study , we also applied bk at a concentration of 10 nm to induce icam - 1 expression and cell motility .
therefore , 10 nm bk represents a pathological condition in prostate cancer metastasis .
icam - 1 is an important adhesion molecule during the adhesion between endothelial cells and cancer cells which is an essential step in cancer invasion [ 35 ] .
several lines of evidence in this study show that icam - 1 is involved in bk - induced cell migration of human prostate cancer cells .
first , bk increased icam - 1 mrna and protein expressions .
second , bk - induced cell migration was inhibited by using specific icam - 1 sirna .
this is not the first proof that icam - 1 is an important mediator in cancer metastasis .
in oral cancer , prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) induced cell motility through icam - 1 up - regulation [ 36 ] .
on the other hand , interleukin ( il ) - 6 enhanced osteosarcoma migration involves icam - 1 expression [ 37 ] .
furthermore , ccn3 also promoted icam - 1 expression and cell motility of human prostate cancer cells [ 25 ] .
collectively , these results suggest that icam - 1is an important target to treat cancer metastasis .
two types of bk receptors , b1 and b2 have been defined and cloned [ 38 ] .
we previously reported that the expression of b2 was associated with a metastatic phenotype of prostate cancer cell lines [ 23 ] .
in addition , blocking of the b2 receptor abolished bk - induced cell migration [ 23 ] .
here , we also confirmed this phenomenon , i.e. , a b2 receptor antagonist and sirna reduced bk - induced increased cell motility in a wound - healing assay .
furthermore , pretreatment of cells with a b2 receptor antagonist or transfection of cells with b2 sirna also decreased bk - mediated icam - 1 expression .
in the current study , we also found that all three prostate cancer cells used expressed the b1 receptor .
however , transfection with b1 sirna did not affect bk - mediated cell migration .
therefore , the b1 receptor is not involved in bk - induced cell motility .
collectively , the results of our previous study and this study suggest that mmp - 9 and icam - 1 expression are involved in bk - mediated cell migration through the b2 receptor .
pi3k - dependent akt activation has been shown to play an important role in bk - mediated cellular functions [ 26,27,39 ] .
we demonstrated that treatment with a pi3k inhibitor and akt inhibitor inhibited bk - induced cell motility and icam - 1 expression , suggesting that pi3k / akt activation is a requisite event in bk - increased cell migration in prostate cancer cells .
this was confirmed by the observation that p85 and akt mutants inhibited the increased migration and icam - 1 expression in human prostate cancer cells .
these results suggest that the pi3k - dependent akt activation is required for bk - induced expression of icam - 1 and cell migration .
in contrast , we previously reported that bk increased prostate cancer migration through the protein kinase cdelta ( pkcdelta )/ c - src signaling pathway [ 23 ] .
in this study , we also provide evidence that pi3k / akt is involved in bk - increased prostate cancer cell migration .
previous studies have reported that the pkcdelta / c - src pathway interacts with the pi3k / akt pathway in different cell types [ 40,41 ] .
however , we did not examine the interaction between the pkcdelta / c - src and pi3k / akt pathways in prostate cancer cells. whether pkcdelta / c - src interacts with pi3k / akt after bk stimulation needs further examination .
there are different binding sites for a number of transcription factors in the human icam - 1 promoter , including nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kappab ) , ap - 1 , sp , and ccaat / enhancer - binding protein binding sites [ 7 ] .
in this study , we found that ap - 1 activation is involved in bk - mediated migratory ability and icam - 1 expression in prostate cancer cells .
the ap - 1 sequence binds to many members of transcription factor families including the jun and fos families .
these nuclear proteins interact with the ap - 1 site as jun homodimers or jun - fos heterodimers formed by protein dimerization through their leucine zipper motifs .
the results of this study show that bk induced c - jun phosphorylation .
furthermore , c - jun sirna abolished bk - induced cell migration and icam - 1 expression in prostate cancer cells .
in addition , bk also enhanced the binding of c - jun to the ap - 1 element in the icam - 1 promoter , as shown in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay .
phosphorylation of c - jun and binding of c - jun to the ap - 1 element as well as c - jun translocation to the nucleus were blocked by treatment with hoe140 , ly294002 , or akt inhibitor .
these results indicate that bk might act through the b2 receptor , pi3k , akt , c - jun , and ap - 1 pathways to induce the expression of icam - 1 and cell migratory ability in human prostate cancer cells .
taken together , our results provide evidence that bk up - regulates migration and icam - 1 expression of human prostate cancer cells via the b2 receptor / pi3k / akt signaling pathway .

5. conclusions here , we present a new mechanism for the bk - mediated migratory ability of prostate cancer cells , i.e. , by up - regulation of icam - 1 .
bk increased the expression of icam - 1 through the b2 receptor , pi3k , akt , and ap - 1 - signaling pathway and migration of human prostate cancer cells ( figure 6e ) .
in addition , the discovery of the bk - mediated signaling pathway may lead us to understanding the mechanism of human prostate cancer metastasis and to help us to develop effective therapies in the future .

novel applications based on the bacterial crispr system make genetic , genomic , transcriptional and epigenomic engineering widely accessible for the first time .
a significant advantage of crispr over previous methods is its tremendous adaptability due to its bipartite nature .
cas9 or its engineered variants define the molecular effect , while short grnas determine the targeting sites .
a majority of crispr approaches depend on the simultaneous delivery of multiple grnas into single cells , either as an essential precondition , to increase responsive cell populations or to enhance phenotypic outcomes .
despite these requirements , methods allowing the efficient generation and delivery of multiple grna expression units into single cells are still sparse .
here we present stagr ( string assembly grna cloning ) , a single step grna multiplexing system , that obtains its advantages by employing the n20 targeting sequences as necessary homologies for gibson assembly .
we show that stagr allows reliable and cost - effective generation of vectors with high numbers of grnas enabling multiplexed crispr approaches .
moreover , stagr is easily customizable , as vector backbones as well as grna structures , numbers and promoters can be freely chosen and combined .
finally , we demonstrate stagr 's widespread functionality , its efficiency in multi - targeting approaches , using it for both , genome and transcriptome editing , as well as applying it in vitro and in vivo .

introduction the adaptation of crispr as a molecular tool has been the most recent revolution in synthetic biology [ 1 ] , since several groups have transformed components of this prokaryotic immune system to acquire programmable genomic targeting [ 2 - 4 ] .
the nuclease cas9 , the only protein component in crispr , has the extraordinary feature of finding and binding those sequences in the genome , that are encoded in a small rna , the guide or grna .
while originally developed to induce double strand brakes on single sites [ 4 ] , several refinements and modifications of both the protein as well as the rna part allow at present a large spectrum of experimental strategies ranging from epigenome engineering to transcriptional activation / repression [ 5 , 6 ] .
many of these are , however , strictly dependent on the simultaneous delivery and expression of multiple grnas .
this includes , for example , the use of cas9 nickases [ 7 ] , the induction of translocations [ 8 , 9 ] , medium scale deletions [ 10 ] , larger genomic alterations [ 11 , 12 ] , crispr mediated generation of conditional alleles [ 10 , 13 ] , generation of concomitant mutations [ 14 ] and long term lineage tracing using crispr [ 15 ] .
furthermore , a large number of crispr strategies rely on multiple targeting sites , sometimes in proximity to each other , to obtain maximal effect sizes ; for example when fusion proteins of the enzymatically dead dcas9 with transcriptional activators [ 16 - 18 ] or chromatin enzymes [ 19 ] are used for transcriptional engineering , epigenome editing [ 20 ] or cellular reprogramming [ 16 , 21 ] .
however , combining multiple individual grna expression vectors to achieve expression of multiple grnas in single cells has its limits , in vitro , as well as in vivo , as the fraction of cells expressing a complete set of grnas is decreasing with the number of grnas used , and those that do , rarely receive stoichiometric levels .
besides these approaches , which are strictly depending on the availability of multiple grnas in single cells , there is also a more general need for quick and cost - effective vector generation .
due to differences in targeting efficiencies and chromatin topology , testing a significant number of potential grna sequences is advisable for most experimental setups .
thus , the availability of customization strategies would constitute decisive advantages .
here we report a simple and cost - effective one step method to generate functional expression vectors for multiple grna delivery with high reliability and a large number of options for customization .
materials and methods a detailed protocol for stagr cloning is available supplementary ( s1 file ) .
hela cells ( gift from stephan beck ) were cultured in dmem medium ( dulbecco 's modified eagle medium ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fcs and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( 10000 u / ml penicillin , 10000 mug / ml streptomycin ) .
cells were grown in a monolayer in cell culture dishes at 37degreesc and 5 % co2 .
p19 ( obtained from atcc ) were cultured in identical conditions , but supplemented with 1 % neaas ( gibco ) .
for each transfection 250,000 cells / well were seeded into 6 - well plates .
2 mug of each stagr and control plasmid was transfected per sample using lipofecatmin2000 according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
seven days after the transfection cells were analysed by flow cytometry or qpcr respectively .
for flow analysis , cells have been trypsinized , washed once with pbs and directly analyzed on a facsariaiii ( tm )( becton dickinson ) flow cytometer .
for each sample , gfp signal of 10000 cells has been recorded .
rna was extracted from p19 cells using the quiagen rnaeasy mini kit according the manufacturer 's instructions .
100 ng rna was reverse transcribed using the thermo fisher cdna first strand kit .
qpcr reactions were performed on an applied biosystems ( tm ) quantstudio ( tm ) 6 flex real - time pcr system .
each 10 - mul reaction consisted of 5 mul of cdna , 5mul powerup ( tm ) sybr ( tm ) green master mix ( thermo scientific ) , and appropriate amount of primers .
the amount of the target transcript was quantified relative to gapdh as a reference .
each sample was assayed at least in triplicates .
for in vivo experiments stagr plasmids and a wildtype cas9 expression construct were mixed with fast green dye ( 0.3 mg ml - 1 ; sigma ) .
400ng ( stagr plasmids ) and 800ng ( expression plasmid containing a cas9 expression cassette derived from [ 22 ]) in 1 mul artificial csf solution have been injected per fish representing a molar plasmid ratio of approximately 1:1 .
to conduct the injections fish were anaesthetized in 0.02 % ms222 and immobilized in a sponge .
a small hole was generated in the skull using a micro - knife to expose the brain tissue between the telencephalon and the optic tectum ( fine science tools ) .
subsequently , ventricular injections of the plasmid dna were performed as previously described [ 23 ] using a glass capillary ( harvard apparatus ) and a pressure injector ( 200hpa , femtojet ( r ) , eppendorf ) .
five electrical pulses ( amplitude : 65v ; duration : 25ms ; intervals : 1s ) were delivered with a square - wave pulse generator tss20 ovodyne ( intracel ) or by using the ecm830 square wave electroporator ( btx harvard apparatus ) .
after the electroporation , fish were awakened in aerated water and kept in their normal husbandry conditions for 7 days until sacrifice and immunohistochemical analysis .
all included animal work ( and protocols ) have been approved by the goverment of upper bavaria ( az 55.2 - 1 - 54 - 2532 - 09 - 16 ) .
for anesthesia , 0.02 % ms222 and for euthanasia , an ms222 overdose ( as approved in the above mentioned protocol ) was used .
results and discussion an optimal method for the routine generation of multiplex grna vectors would combine simplicity with speed , would be cost - effective , efficient and highly customizable .
aiming to meet these requirements we designed a cloning strategy ( stagr ) based on enzymatic assembly of short grna expression units , amplified from a single dna fragment as a template , the string ( s1 fig ) .
to avoid the need to purchase new strings for each individual grna , we omitted the n20 targeting sequence on the dna fragment , containing only the grna hairpin , a transcriptional stop signal ( poly dt ) and a human u6 promoter .
instead , we provide the individual n20 sequences by short overhang primers used to amplify the string by pcr ( fig 1 ) .
in contrast to existing cloning strategies stagr provides three distinct advantages : ( 1 ) any chosen grna expression unit can be amplified from the same dna string ; ( 2 ) any specific number or chosen combination of grna transcription units can be cloned using one single string , since the n20 targeting sequences provides the necessary homology for gibson assembly [ 24 ] ; ( 3 ) substitution and combination of different strings as pcr template allows straight - forward customization to different cas9 - or expression - systems .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0196015.g001 fig 1 the stagr protocol .
( a ) an overview over stagr procedure .
stagr allows simple and fast generation of multiplexing vectors in one overnight reaction .
stagr is also highly customizable as diverse strings and vectors can be used to assemble expression cassettes with different promoters and grna scaffolds .
( b ) sequences of overhang primers used for generation of stagr vectors .
first , we tested the feasibility of stagr by aiming to clone three different sets of four individual grnas into a standard grna expression vector , pgrna1 [ 25 , 26 ] .
following a standard pcr and gibson assembly protocol ( s1 file , s1 fig ) , we routinely achieved hundreds of bacterial ampicillin resistant colonies , indicating a large number of transformation events .
to avoid unnecessary time - and cost - consuming vector preparation and sequencing , we devised a robust pcr strategy to quickly characterize the accuracy of the transformed vectors in individual bacterial colonies ( s1 file , fig 2a ) .
this enabled us not only to concentrate downstream analysis on a distinct set of vectors , but also to comprehensively characterize stagr efficiencies .
the quantification presented in fig 2b and the example of an analytical gel in fig 2a shows that the tested stagr strategy is successful in generating individual multiplexed grna vectors .
indeed , over a third ( 34 % , ( n = 130 )) of bacterial clones possessed the envisaged four grna expression units , which , as confirmed by subsequent sanger sequencing , have been matching the in silico designed grna vector perfectly in most tested cases ( 90 % , 5 clones each sequenced in 8 independent experiments ; n = 40 ) .
this indicated that likely a small number of bacterial clones are sufficient to routinely retrieve immediately at least one impeccable plasmid .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0196015.g002 fig 2 functional validation of stagr .
( a ) colony pcr of a 4xstagr reaction ( using a string sequence containing a hu6 promoter and a canonical grna scaffold ) .
24 bacterial colonies are shown , of which six present the amplicon size indicative of the full length reaction ( 1596 bp ) .
additionally marked are amplicon sizes indicative of two ( 823 bp ) and single grnas ( 458 bp ) .
( b ) quantification of cloning efficiencies from three different 4xstagr reactions ( n = 130 ) .
( c ) a schematic showing constructs used for functional validation of stagr grnas .
a grna targeting the gfp orf was either delivered in a single grna expression vector or on each of four different positions in stagr vectors .
( d ) functional validation of stagr vectors shown in fig 2c .
hela cells stably expressing d2gfp and cas9 have been transfected with vectors depicted above .
flow cytometry indicates that stagr constructs are similarly efficient in mutating the orf of gfp compared to a single grna vector .
( e ) colony pcr of a 4xstagr reaction using four different promoters and sam loop scaffolds .
24 bacterial colonies are shown , of which seven colonies incorporated the amplicon size indicative of the full length reaction ( 2043 bp ) .
shorter amplicons are indicative of grna subsets , which vary in size , depending on the incorporated promoter .
vectors containing multiple grna expression cassettes in close proximity are crucially dependent on efficient promoter and terminator sequences as transcriptional interference and / or transcriptional run - through hamper the functionality of individual grna sequences .
since it is still a complicated task to characterize these undesirable effects , as well as to determine the integrity and expression of individual grnas directly , we instead employed instead a genetic assay to quantify whether the effectiveness of a grna cassette changes with its position on an otherwise identical stagr plasmid .
we incorporated a single gfp - targeting grna into four stagr plasmids and compared them directly to standard vectors containing only one single grna expression unit .
we chose the assembly in such a way , that the gfp - targeting grna becomes incorporated on four different positions between three non - gfp - targeting control grna units ( fig 2c and 2d ) .
we transfected human hela cells , stably expressing cas9 and gfp , with the above mentioned grna expression plasmids and found that when using a single grna expression vector 72 % of cells lost gfp expression after eight days , indicating the creation of detrimental orf mutations .
reassuringly , stagr plasmids containing the same gfp targeting grna on any of the four positions ( next to non - gfp - targeting control grnas ) triggered comparable gfp loss in site - by - site experiments , indicating similar functionality to single grna expression plasmids and suggesting absence of transcriptional interference or read - through in the stagr vectors .
to demonstrate the customizability of the presented stagr protocol , we generated a series of strings to be used as alternative templates ( fig 1 ) .
we tested not only the adaptability of stagr to different promoters , but also structurally different grna sequences .
shown as an example in fig 2e is the assembly of four grnas , driven by four different promoter ( human u6 , mouse u6 , 7sk and h1 ) and each containing additional rna structures ( one or two sam loops ) 3 ' from the grna hairpin to allow the targeting of ms2 - fusion proteins to chosen genomic sites in addition to cas9 fusion proteins [ 27 ] .
one step stagr assembly of this highly customized and combinatorial strategy proofed to be of similar efficiency as the stagr strategy described before ( ca .
30 % , fig 2e ) and indicates a decisive advantage for the use of this method when combining different cas9 variants , ms2 fusion proteins or dcas9 effectors to further investigate the limits of the stagr protocol we increased the number of grna cassettes to be incorporated in one single reaction step .
as depicted in fig 3a , increasing the number of individual grna cassettes to six did not change the efficiency of the stagr approach .
a significant proportion of bacterial colonies were indicative of full grna incorporation in the pcr assay ( 30 % , n = 24 ) and all those tested were revealing perfect assembly when sequenced ( s2a fig ) .
following the stagr protocol we routinely generate vectors with up to eight expression units , the maximum number of units we have tested so far ( fig 3b ) and to our knowledge amongst the highest number of grna units generated on single crispr vectors by any method .
moreover , colony pcrs also reveal , that those stagr clones , which apparently do not contain all grna expression units in completion , possess mostly insert sizes representing integer multiples of single grna expression units , something we have observed in each experiment we have conducted so far ( figs 2a , 2e and 3a ) .
thus we employed sanger sequencing to investigate , the origin of the assembly failure and the sequences of the resulting plasmids .
interestingly , nearly all ( 87 % , n = 15 ) of those truncated plasmids contained in silico designed sequences without a cloning scar , breakage points or sequence repetition , but were entirely lacking one or more grna expression units ( for examples see s2b - s2e fig ) .
this surprising result is due to a low - probability alignment of string sequences during assembly and offers the unexpected possibility to use stagr not only for the generation of multiplex grna vectors , but also for the simultaneous obtainment of grna subsets .

the gel shows a colony pcr of 22 bacterial colonies , of which seven showed the amplicon indicative of the full length stagr reaction ( 2444bp ) .
( b ) exemplary colony pcr of stagr constructs with 0 to 8 grna expression cassettes .
( c ) a stagr plasmid containing four grnas or a mixture of four single grna plasmids have been transfected into p19 cells expressing dcas9 - vpr .
( d ) after 7 days mrna was extracted and transcript levels of target genes have been compared via qpcr .
error bars depict standard errors of the mean .
to demonstrate the added value of combining multiple grnas on single vectors , we produced a stagr plasmid containing four grnas , of which one is targeting the promoter of the neuronal gene satb2 , one is targeting the promoter of the cardiac muscle actin gene actc1 and the last two are binding the promoter region of the gene ttn1 ( fig 3c ) .
dcas9 - vpr expressing p19 cells transfected with this stagr plasmid upregulate two of three of these genes substantially stronger than cells receiving only a mixture of single grnas , indicating a distinct advantage for the use of stagr in transcript activation over conventional approaches ( fig 3d ) .
to test whether the in vivo use of stagr plasmids allows efficient simultaneous disruption of multiple genes in individual cells , we employed expression vectors commonly used in zebrafish and used the protocol at hand to incorporate three grnas targeting gfp and sox2 or a control stagr vector .
subsequently , we electroporated ependymoglia in the brains of three and a half months old gfap - gfp transgenic zebrafish , tg ( gfap : gfp ) ( n = 6 ) , as previously done [ 28 , 29 ] in three independent experiments using stagr plasmids and a wildtype cas9 expression construct ( fig 4 [ 22 ]) .
seven days later we analyzed the outcome , which proved to be highly reproducible over animals and experiments .
as depicted in fig 4 , a large number of ependymoglia lost gfp and sox2 expression , while in the control electroporated brains ependymoglia cells continuously express both proteins .
to our knowledge this represents the first crispr mediated gene knockout in adult fish brains .
moreover , most cells negative for one protein were also devoid of the other , certifying an efficient accomplishment of multiple gene targeting using stagr in vivo .

conclusions efficient multi - gene and - locus targeting provides a critical bottleneck for the implementation of the ever increasing toolbox of crispr based methods .
combinations of a large number of grna expression vectors have the disadvantage that only a subset of cells receives all grna sequences .
furthermore , the limited number of available antibiotic and fluorescent selection markers makes this subset not even accessible for selective analysis .
the synthesis of multi - grna expression vectors is slow and expensive and thus impedes the comprehensive validation of different targeting efficiencies and grna sequences , as well as a straight forward customization of vector backbones and crispr systems for most experimental setups .
in contrast to this , stagr is fast , cheap and highly efficient .
employing the protospacer sequences of the grnas as sources of homology for gibson assembly enables simple and customizable vector generation for multi - gene and multi - locus targeting .
following the attached protocol , vectors allowing the simultaneous targeting of high numbers of genes or loci can be generated efficiently in one over - night reaction .
moreover , the stagr protocol does not depend on expensive or restricted materials or skill sets ; its simplicity makes the application universally available ( see detailed supplementary manual , s1 file ) .
only few strategies have been published so far which allow the multiplexed generation of multiple grna vectors [ 30 - 34 ] .
these methods have much practical value , but they either lack the simplicity of vector generation in a single step , the high number of individual grna expression cassettes that can be combined , the customizability and / or the independence from purchasing new large dna fragments for each individual grna sequence .
stagr , a one - step method for the generation of functional grna vectors , is reliable , highly customizable , simple and efficient , to prove its effectiveness we used it to generate the first in vivo gene targeting in the adult fish brain .

aberrant transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) plays an important role in the development of cancer such as tumor metastasis and invasion .
tgf - beta - responsive gene signature is highly activated in chemotherapy - treated triple negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) .
here , we investigated the effect of zerumbone ( zer ) on tgf - beta1 signaling pathway and tumorigenecity of tnbc cells .
our results showed that the level of tgf - beta1 mrna expression and cell invasiveness were higher in tnbc cells than in non - tnbc cells .
on the other hand , the cell motility of tnbc cells was completely suppressed by ly2109761 , a novel selective tgf - beta receptor type i / ii ( tbetari / ii ) dual inhibitor .
in addition , fn and mmp - 2 expression , which play an important role on cell motility in various cancer cells , were dose - dependently decreased by ly2109761 .
tgf - beta1 increased fn , mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 expression in hcc1806 tnbc cells .
tgf - beta1 - induced mmp - 9 expression was decreased by both a mek inhibitor , uo126 , and a smad3 inhibitor , sis3 .
induction of fn and mmp - 2 by tgf - beta1 was just decreased by sis3 .
overexpression of smad3 significantly increased fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression .
interestingly , zer significantly suppressed tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression in hcc1806 cells .
in addition , zer completely decreased tgf - beta1 - induced the phosphorylation of smad3 .
finally , we observed that zer suppressed the tumorigenecity such as tumor volume , weight , ki67 expression , and metastasis in tnbc cells xenograft models .
taken together , we demonstrated that zer suppresses tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression through the inactivation of smad3 and inhibits the tumorigenecity of tnbc cells .
therefore , we suggest that zer may act as a promising drug for treatment of tnbc .
zerumbone tgf - beta1 smad3 cell invasion triple negative breast cancer introduction triple - negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) accounts for 15 % to 20 % of breast cancers and is a heterogeneous disease [ 1 , 2 ] .
tnbc are defined by their failure to express the estrogen receptor ( er ) , progesterone receptor ( pr ) , and human - epidermal growth factor receptor - 2 ( her2 ) proteins [ 3 ]. of all subtypes of breast cancer , tnbc tends to occur in younger age with pre - menopausal women and occurs more frequently in african american women [ 4 , 5 ] .
in addition , tnbc is typically associated with poor prognosis when compared with other breast cancer subtypes [ 4 - 7 ] .
especially , highly recurrent rate of tnbc is associated with aggressive phenotype , chemotherapy resistance , and the lack of clinically therapeutic targets [ 6 , 8 ] .
to date , no therapeutic agents have been clinically approved for treatment of tnbc .
thus , many researchers focus on the development of new therapeutic agents for treatment of tnbc .
transforming growth factor - betas ( tgf - beta ) are multifunctional growth factors that play particularly complex roles in the growth , progression , and metastatic potential of cancers [ 9 ] .
tgf - beta1 is highly expressed in a various cancers such as tnbc , prostate , and lung cancer and leads to tumor promotion and metastasis [ 10 , 11 ] .
in late - stage human tumors , the level of tgf - beta1 expression frequently increases and aberrant tgf - beta1 expression is associated with more aggressive tumors and poor prognosis [ 10 , 12 ] .
one of several targeted strategies for the treatment of patients with tnbc is the neutralization of tgf - beta [ 13 ] .
nam et al. reported that treatment of mice with a monoclonal anti - tgf - beta antibody strongly suppresses development of either lung - or bone metastases in 4t1 syngeneic mammary tumor models [ 13 ] .
in addition , induction of epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) by tgf - beta facilitates the invasiveness of breast cancer cells [ 14 - 16 ] .
fn is a large adhesive glycoprotein and plays an important role on cell migration , invasion , and differentiation [ 17 ] .
fn augments human carcinoma cell growth through upregulation of inflammatory factors such as cox - 2 and il - 8 in lung cancer cells [ 18 , 19 ] .
in addition , fn triggers mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 expression which are involved with cell invasion and migration through binding of rgd sequence of alpha5beta1 integrin in several human carcinoma cells , including breast cancer cells [ 18 , 19 ] .
aberrant mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 expression is apparent in breast cancers and these proteins release often associated with tumor invasion and metastasis [ 20 ] .
zerumbone ( zer ) was first isolated from a southeast asian ginger sesquiterpene and has a wide range of pharmacologic effects , such as anti - inflammation , antioxidant agent , and anti - carcinogenic agents in a variety of tumor cells including breast , colon , and gastric cancer [ 21 - 23 ] .
we also reported that zer suppresses il - 1beta - induced cell invasion by inhibiting il - 8 expression and mmp - 3 expression in tnbc cells [ 24 ] .
in addition , zer completely reduces angiogenesis through the inhibition of nf - kappab activity and nf - kappab - dependent proangiogenic genes such as vegf and il - 8 [ 25 , 26 ] .
zer inhibits cell growth of various cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis via the down - regulation of surviving and bcl2 [ 21 ] .
abdelwahab et al. has suggested that zer is a promising chemotherapeutic agent through the cell cycle of g2 / m phase and the suppression of il - 6 secretion in cervical and ovarian cancer cells [ 27 ] .
in this study , we evaluated the inhibitory effect of zer on tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression in tnbc cells .
we found that the level of tgf - beta1 expression was higher in tnbc than in non - tnbc .
the activation of smad3 by tgf - beta1 was closely associated with the induction of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression .
in contrast , blocking of smad3 significantly declined tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression .
we found for the first time that zer completely abolished tgf - beta1 - induced smad3 phosphorylation and then , reduced tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression as well as the tumorigenecity of tnbc cells .
results the level of tgf - beta1 expression and cell invasion is higher in tnbc than in non - tnbc elevated tgf - beta1 is correlated with a high incidence of distant metastasis of various tumor cells and promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) , ecm degradation , cell migration , cell invasion , and angiogenesis [ 11 , 28 ] .
thus , we investigated the level of tgf - beta1 mrna expression between in non - tnbc cells and in tnbc cells .
interestingly , our results showed that tgf - beta1 mrna and protein expression was significantly increased in tnbc cells compared with non - tnbc cells ( figure 1a and 1b ) .
the level of tgf - beta1 mrna expression in mda231 and hs578t cells was significantly increased by 9.0 - fold and 20.2 - fold of the level of zr75 - 1 cells , respectively ( figure 1a ) .
in addition , the levels of fn and mmp - 2 mrna expression were also increased in tnbc cells , although mmp - 9 expression did not show a sharp difference ( figure 1c ) .
especially , the levels of fn and mmp - 2 protein expression were significantly increased in hs578t cells ( figure 1d ) .
furthermore , we observed that the invasion capacity of tnbc cells also was far superior to non - tnbc ( figure 1e ) .
therefore , we demonstrated that the increasing amount of tgf - beta1 may be correlated with the invasion and migration of tnbc cells .
figure 1 the level of tgf - beta1 expression and cell invasion is higher in tnbc cells than in non - tnbc cells after serum - starvation for 24 h , breast cancer cells were harvested for detection the levels of tgf - beta1 mrna a. and protein b. expression using the real - time pcr and elisa , respectively. c. the levels of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 mrna expression were analyzed by real - time pcr in breast cancer cells. d. the levels of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 protein expression were analyzed by western blotting and zymography , respectively. e. after seeding of 5x105 cells / well , breast cancer cells further incubated for 48 h. after 48 h incubation , cells on the bottom side of filter were fixed and stained .
cell morphology was analyzed using a ck40 inverted microscope .
the results are representative of three independent experiments .

the migration and invasion of tnbc cells is suppressed by ly2109761 treatment to verify the co - relation between tgf - beta and motility of tnbc cells , we treated with a dual tgf - beta receptor i / ii inhibitor , ly2109761 , for 24 h in hs578t and mda231 cells .
as expected , our results showed that the migration of tnbc cells was significantly decreased by ly2109761 in both hs578t and mda231 cells ( figure 2a ) .
in addition , invasion capacity of tnbc cells was also suppressed by ly2109761 treatment ( figure 2b ) .
in previous studies , highly expressed fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 trigger cell invasion and migration in several human carcinoma cells , including breast cancer cells [ 18 , 19 ] .
so , we investigated the level of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression by ly2109761 in hs578t cells .
our result showed that the levels of fn and mmp - 2 protein expression were decreased by ly2109761 in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 2c ) .
here , we cannot detect endogenous mmp - 9 expression of hs578t cells ( data not shown ) .
the levels of fn and mmp - 2 mrna were decreased to 0.63 +/ - 0.07 - fold and 0.33 +/ - 0.01 - fold of the control level , respectively , at 20 mum ly2109761 treatment ( figure 2d ) .
furthermore , we investigated the effect of tgf - beta receptor i ( tgfbri ) and tgf - beta receptor ii ( tgfbrii ) sirna on fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 mrna expression .
as shown in supplement figure 1 , the levels of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 mrna expression were decreased by tgfbri or tgfbrii sirna overexpression , respectively , in a cell - specifically .
therefore , we demonstrated that elevated tgf - beta expression may increase the cell invasion and migration through the induction of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 in tnbc cells .

fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression is increased by tgf - beta1 treatment in a dose - and time - dependent manner in hcc1806 breast cancer cells to investigate the regulatory mechanism of cell invasion and migration by tgf - beta1 in tnbc cells , we chosen the hcc1806 triple negative breast cancer cells .
as shown in figure 1a , the level of tgf - beta1 mrna expression was relatively lower than other tnbc cells .
in addition , sum159 and hcc1806 cells have been known very high tgf - beta sensitivity [ 29 ] .
thus , we treated hcc1806 cells with tgf - beta1 for the indicated dose and time .
the levels of fn , mmp - 9 , and mmp - 2 protein expression were dose - and time - dependently increased by tgf - beta1 ( figure 3a and 3b ) .
in addition , we observed that the activity of smad3 and erk was significantly increased by tgf - beta1 ( figure 3c ) .
based on these results , we demonstrated that tgf - beta1 directly augments the levels of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 through the activation of various signaling molecules in tnbc cells .

tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression is decreased by smad3 - dependent pathway to investigate the regulatory mechanism of tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expressions , we treated hcc1806 cells with 10 ng / ml tgf - beta1 for 24 h after pretreatment with uo126 ( a mek inhibitor ) and sis3 ( a smad3 inhibitor ) for 30 min , respectively .
to assess the levels of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 mrna and protein expression , we harvested the cell lysates and culture media , respectively .
as shown in figure 4a , tgf - beta1 - induced fn mrna expression was decreased by sis3 ( 1.4 +/ - 0.05 - fold of the control level ) .
induction of mmp - 9 mrna by tgf - beta1 also significantly decreased by uo126 ( 11.5 +/ - 1.8 - fold of the control level ) and sis3 ( 9.2 +/ - 3.2 - fold of the control level ) , respectively ( figure 4b ) .
in addition , tgf - beta1 - induced mmp - 2 mrna expression was decreased by sis3 ( 0.24 +/ - 0.02 - fold of the control level ) but not by uo126 ( figure 4c ) .
under the same conditions , our results showed that tgf - beta1 - induced fn and mmp - 2 protein expressions were markedly decreased by sis3 treatment ( figure 4d ) .
however , tgf - beta1 / erk signaling pathway was not affected on tgf - beta1 - induced fn and mmp - 2 protein expressions ( figure 4d ) .
tgf - beta1 - induced mmp - 9 protein expressions were decreased by uo126 and sis3 treatment , respectively ( figure 4d ) .
here , we confirmed the effect of each inhibitor on tgf - beta1 - induced the phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 and smad3 .
as expected , tgf - beta1 - induced the phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 and smad3 was well abolished by uo126 and sis3 , respectively ( figure 4e ) .
based on these results , we demonstrated that tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expressions were regulated through the smad3 - dependent pathway in tnbc cells .

the effect of zer on cell viability , the level of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 mrna and cell migration to verify the effect of zer on cell viability , fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expressions , we treated hcc1806 cells with 10 and 20 mum zer for 24 h , respectively .
the chemical structure of zer was indicated in figure 5a .
our results showed that cell viability had no significant change by 10 and 20 mum zer treatment in tnbc ( figure 5b ) .
however , we observed that zer triggered the cell cycle arrest at g2 / m phase in hcc1806 cells ( figure 5c ) whereas , cell cycle of mda - mb231 cells did not affect by zer ( data not shown ) .
in previous study , xian et al. reported that zer was sensitive to nb4 and u937 leukemic cells but resistant to molt4 and kt - 1 leukemic cells [ 30 ] .
therefore , we also suggested that hcc1806 cells were more sensitive to zer than mda - mb231 cells .

to investigate the effect of zer on the basal level of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 mrna expressions in hcc1806 cells , we treated with 10 and 20 mum zer , respectively , for 24 h. our results showed that zer decreased the levels of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 protein and mrna expression in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 5d and 5e ) .
the basal levels of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 mrna expression were reduced to 0.18 +/ - 0.03 - fold , 0.28 +/ - 0.04 - fold , and 0.35 0.02 - fold of the control level at 20 mum zer treatment ( figure 5e ) .
in addition , we examined the effect of zer on cell migration of hcc1806 .
as expected , we observed that the migration rate of hcc1806 cells was significantly decreased by zer ( figure 5f ) .
therefore , we suggested that zer suppressed migration of tnbc cells through the down - regulation of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 .
zer treatment suppresses tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression through the inhibition of smad3 activity next , we investigated whether zer regulates tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expressions .
after pretreatment with 10 and 20 m zer for 16 h , hcc1806 cells with 10 ng / ml tgf - beta1 for 24 h. we observed that fn mrna expression by tgf - beta1 was increased by 11.6 +/ - 1.5 - fold of the control level ( figure 6a ) .
in contrast , tgf - beta1 - induced fn mrna expression was suppressed to 1.5 +/ - 0.1 - fold of the control level at 20 mum zer treatment ( figure 6a ) .
furthermore , tgf - beta1 - induced mmp - 9 and mmp - 2 mrna expression was completely decreased to 3.1 +/ - 1.3 - fold and 0.76 +/ - 0.07 - fold of the control level at 20 mum zer treatment , respectively ( figure 6b and 6c ) .
as expected , our results also showed that tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 protein expressions were abolished by zer treatment in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 6d ) .
therefore , we demonstrated that zer downregulates the levels of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression through the inhibition of tgf - beta signaling pathway in tnbc cells .
figure 6 zer suppresses tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression through the inhibition of smad3 activity after serum - starvation for 24 h , hcc1806 cells were pretreated with 10 and 20 mum zer , respectively , for 16 h and then they were treated with 10 ng / ml tgf - beta1 for 24 h. the levels of fn a. , mmp - 2 b. , and mmp - 9 c. mrna were analyzed by real - time pcr. d. under the same condition , the levels of fn protein expression were analyzed by western blotting .

next , we studied the effect of zer on tgf - beta1 - induced the phosphorylation of smad3 in hcc1806 breast cancer cells .
after pretreatment with 10 and 20 mum zer for 16 h , the cells were treated with 10 ng / ml tgf - beta1 for 30 min .
here , we observed that tgfbeta1 - induced the phosphorylation of smad3 was completely suppressed by 20 mum zer treatment ( figure 6e ) .
however , tgfbeta1 - induced the phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 did not affect by zer treatment ( figure 6e ) .
to verify the alteration of fn , mmp - 9 , and mmp - 2 expression by smad3 overexpression , hcc1806 cells were transfected with adenoviral vec ( ad - vec ) and smad3 ( ad - smad3 ) , respectively , for 48 h. as shown in figure 6f , the levels of fn , mmp - 9 , and mmp - 2 expression were significantly increased by smad3 overexpression .
therefore , we demonstrated that zer may suppress tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression through the inhibition of smad3 - dependent pathway in tnbc cells .
zer suppresses the growth and metastasis of tnbc xenograft tumors next , we investigated the antitumor potential of zer in vivo via oral administration in an orthotopic xenografts model using mda - mb231 - luc cells .
we injected mda - 231 - luc cells ( 5 x 106 cell / 100 mul ) into the right secondary mammary fat .
in the orthotopic model , tumor volume was suppressed by zer treatment compared with vehicle - treated mice ( figure 7a ) .
in addition , mice treated with 20 mg / kg zer ( 4.7 +/ - 2.8 x 109 photons / sec ) developed significantly smaller tumors than the control mice treated with vehicle ( 70.4 +/ - 3.1 x 109 photons / sec ) as measured by in vivo luciferase activity ( figure 7b ) .
we checked that the tumor weight level of zer treated mice ( 1.22 +/ - 0.35 g ) also decreased in compared with vehicle treated mice ( 2.56 +/ - 0.68 g ) ( figure 7c ) .
finally , we further evaluated the effect of zer on the expression of ki - 67 which is a marker of proliferation .
as shown in figure 7d , the expression of ki - 67 was downregulated in zer treated mice as compared with vehicle treated mice .
the positivity of ki - 67 decreased to 37.5 +/ - 5.1 % of the vehicle level at 20 mg / kg zer treatment ( figure 7d ) .
in addition , we observed that fn expression was significantly decreased by zer treated mice , although tgf - beta1 expression did not change ( supplement figure 2 ) .
finally , we investigated the effect of zer on metastasis using the 4t1 mammary carcinoma cells which are highly tumorigenic and invasive model .
as shown in supplement figure 3a , we observed that zer completely suppressed the metastatic potential of 4t1 cells xenograft tumors .
vehicle treated mice manifested large metastatic nodules in the lung , whereas these metastatic nodules significant decreased in zer treated mice ( supplement figure 3a ) .
especially , the number of metastatic nodules of zer treated mice ( 9.6 +/ - 2.7 nodules ) also decreased in compared with vehicle treated mice ( 27.1 +/ - 4.9 nodules ) ( supplement figure 3b ) .
based on these results , we demonstrated that zer significantly suppresses the growth and metastatic potential of tnbc xenograft tumors .

discussion tgf - betas can modulate a variety of biological events such as cell growth , extracellular matrix formation , angiogenesis , and cancer progression [ 31 , 32 ] .
plasma levels of tgf - betas are elevated in patients with breast cancer whereas after surgical removal of the primary tumor , highly expressed tgf - beta1 levels normalize in the majority of patients [ 33 , 34 ] .
in addition , elevated tgf - beta1 is correlated with increased tumor invasiveness and disease progression in a variety of tumors such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer [ 34 , 35 ] .
tgf - beta - responsive gene signature is highly activated in chemotherapy - treated triple negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) when compared to other subtypes [ 29 ] .
consistent with these reports , we found that the level of tgf - beta1 expression and invasiveness is higher in tnbc cells than in non - tnbc cells .
on the other hand , the motility of tnbc cells , including invasion and migration is significantly decreased by ly2109761 , a novel selective tgf - beta receptor type i / ii ( tbetari / ii ) dual inhibitor .
therefore , we demonstrate that aberrant tgf - beta1 expression directly or indirectly regulates the aggressive and invasive properties of tnbc cells .
tgf - beta1 is also regarded as a metastasis inducer and promotes emt associated the induction of various genes such as fn and mmps with increased tumor cell motility [ 36 , 37 ] .
increased fn expression level is associated with tumor progression and poor prognoses in breast cancer patients [ 38 ] .
fn expression is closely involved with the growth and / or metastasis of surrounding tumor cells through the induction of emt [ 39 , 40 ] .
we have also reported that fn treatment significantly augmented the rates of invasion and adhesion while fn - induced cell invasion was suppressed by the fn inhibitor ( rgd tetrapeptide ) in breast cancer cells [ 41 ] .
consistent with these reports , we also found that basal level of fn is augmented in tnbc cells .
in contrast , highly expressed fn level is decreased tgf - beta receptor type i / ii dual inhibitor in a dose - dependent manner in hs578t cells .
therefore , we demonstrate that blocking of tgf - beta1 signaling pathway by tgf - beta receptor type i / ii dual inhibitors mediates the downregualtion of fn expression and then may directly or indirectly affect the motility of tnbc cells .
although we could not fine the relationship between fn and mmps expression in recent study [ 41 ] , secreted fn enhances mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 expression through the mapk and the pi3 - k / akt - dependent pathways in breast and ovarian cancer cells [ 19 , 42 ] .
elevated expression of mmp - 2 or mmp - 9 is associated with human cancer invasion and metastasis [ 20 ] .
in this study , we observed that the invasiveness of tnbc cells is significantly increased when compared to that of non - tnbc cells .
especially , the level of mmp - 2 mrna expression is higher in tnbc cells than in non - tnbc cells .
on the other hand , elevated mmp - 2 expression was decreased by tgf - beta receptor type i / ii dual inhibitors .
therefore , we suggest that mmp - 2 expression is also regulated through the tgf - beta dependent signalling pathway .
in addition , increased mmp - 2 as well as tgf - beta1 - induced mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 expression is associated with tnbc progression and metastasis .
tgf - beta1 can stimulate the motility of many cancer cells such as prostate and breast cancer through in a variety of signaling pathway [ 15 , 28 , 34 ] .
the activation of mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) such as the extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( erk1 / 2 ) and the p38 map kinase ( p38 mapk ) in response to tgf - beta1 triggers cellular migration and invasion [ 43 ] .
consistent with these reports , our results showed that tgf - beta1 induces the activity of erk and smad3 in hcc1806 tnbc cells .
interestingly , tgf - beta1 - stimulated fn and mmp - 9 expression is suppressed by uo126 but not mmp - 2 .
however , the induction of fn , mmp - 9 and mmp - 2 by tgf - beta1 is suppressed by sis3 treatment .
therefore , we demonstrate that tgf - 1 / smad3 signaling pathway is regarded as a metastatic modulator on the induction of fn , mmp - 9 , and mmp - 2 by tgf - beta1 in tnbc cells .
zerumbone ( zer ) , a sesquiterpene in subtropical ginger , has been reported to inhibit tumor growth and to induce apoptosis against a wide variety of tumor cells , including colon cancer and leukemia cells [ 23 , 30 ] .
murakami et al. reported that zer suppresses 7,12 - dimethylbenz [ alpha ] anthracene - and tpa - induced initiation and promotion of skin tumors [ 44 ] .
consistent with these reports , we observed that the tumorigenecity of mda - mb231 cells and the ki67 positivity were also decreased by zer treatment .
in addition , zer inhibits the de novo synthesis of inos and cox - 2 through the suppression of nf - kappab and ikappa - balpha kinase activation [ 21 ] .
recently , we reported that zer abolishes cd44 expression through the inhibition of egf / stat - 3 pathway in breast cancer cells [ 45 ] .
furthermore , zer significantly decreased cell invasion of tnbc through the suppression of il - 8 and mmp - 3 expression [ 24 ] .
in this study , we found for the first time that zer significantly suppresses tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression through the inhibition of smad3 phosphorylation .
therefore , we demonstrate that zer acts as a novel drug for suppression of cell motility and tumor growth of tnbc cells .
here , we investigated the effect of zer as a therapeutic drug for treatment of tnbc .
we found for the first time that the levels of tgf - beta1 mrna expression significantly increased in tnbc cells compared with other subtypes .
in addition , tnbc cells highly expressed the invasion related genes , including fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 as well as the invasion rates is also significantly increased in tnbc cells compared with other subtypes .
as expected , tgf - beta receptor i / ii inhibitor , ly2109761 significantly decreased not only the invasion and migration of tnbc cells but also the level of fn and mmp - 2 expression .
therefore , our data establish that aberrant tgf - beta1 expression influences the invasion and migration of tnbc cells through the induction of fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 .
interestingly , zer dose - dependently suppressed the levels of basal - and tgf - beta1 - induced fn , mmp - 2 , and mmp - 9 expression in hcc1806 tnbc cells through the inhibition of smad3 activity .
in addition , zer effectively suppresses the growth and metastatic potential of tnbc xenograft tumors .
so , we suggest that zer can be considered a promising targetable drug for tnbc treatment .

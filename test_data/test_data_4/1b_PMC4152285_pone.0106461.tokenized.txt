background in the us , denormalizing tobacco use is key to tobacco control ; less attention has been paid to denormalizing tobacco sales .
however , some localities have placed limits on the number and type of retailers who may sell tobacco , and some retailers have abandoned tobacco sales voluntarily .
understanding community norms surrounding tobacco sales may help accelerate tobacco denormalization .
methods we conducted 15 focus groups with customers of california , new york , and ohio retailers who had voluntarily discontinued tobacco sales to examine normative assumptions about where cigarettes should or should not be sold , voluntary decisions to discontinue tobacco sales , and government limits on such sales .
results groups in all three states generally agreed that grocery stores that sold healthy products should not sell tobacco ; california groups saw pharmacies similarly , while this was a minority opinion in the other two states .
convenience stores were regarded as a natural place to sell tobacco .
in each state , it was regarded as normal and commendable for some stores to want to stop selling tobacco , although few participants could imagine convenience stores doing so. views on government 's role in setting limits on tobacco sales varied , with california and new york participants generally expressing support for restrictions , and ohio participants expressing opposition .
however , even those who expressed opposition did not approve of tobacco sales in all possible venues .
banning tobacco sales entirely was not yet normative .
conclusion limiting the ubiquitous availability of tobacco sales is key to ending the tobacco epidemic .
some limits on tobacco sales appear to be normative from the perspective of community members ; it may be possible to shift norms further by problematizing the ubiquitous presence of cigarettes and drawing connections to other products already subject to restrictions .

introduction denormalizing tobacco use through social norm change that " pushes tobacco use out of the charmed circle of normal , desirable practice " [ 1 ] , p .
225 has been a key component of tobacco control , motivating smokers to quit [ 2 ] and protecting nonsmokers from second - hand smoke [ 3 ] .
yet , in the u.s. , tobacco products remain ubiquitous , available 24 hours a day , 7 days a week from numerous retail outlets , helping to sustain the ongoing tobacco epidemic [ 4 ] , p .
307. some localities have limited the number and type of retailers that sell tobacco [ 5 ] - [ 6 ] , and some retailers have voluntarily stopped selling tobacco altogether [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] , including most recently cvs , the national pharmacy chain [ 10 ] .
these developments may foreshadow the beginning of the denormalization of retail tobacco sales .
recently , the u.s. surgeon general 's report on the health consequences of smoking identified restrictions on sales as one of two promising " endgame " strategies for the tobacco epidemic [ 11 ] .
understanding community norms surrounding tobacco sales can help accelerate this process , by identifying aspects of tobacco sales on which denormalization efforts might most productively focus .
a handful of studies have examined public opinion regarding tobacco sales in various venues , particularly pharmacies and grocery stores [ 12 ] - [ 15 ] .
these showed that slightly more than half of san franciscans ( 56 %) and new yorkers ( 57 %) sampled favored banning tobacco sales in pharmacies [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] , and half of new yorkers favored banning sales in grocery stores [ 12 ] .
support for both policies is lower nationally [ 15 ] .
this study draws on focus group discussions among customers of california , new york , and ohio retailers that had voluntarily ended tobacco sales to examine normative assumptions concerning where cigarettes should or should not be sold , voluntary decisions to discontinue tobacco sales , and government limits on such sales .
methods from 2009 - 2013 , we conducted 15 focus groups ( moderated group interviews useful in exploring variability in poorly understood phenomena ) [ 16 ] - [ 17 ] with 84 patrons of california , new york , and ohio grocery stores and pharmacies that had voluntarily discontinued tobacco sales in the seven years prior to data collection ( table 1 ) .
we identified these businesses through media accounts , information obtained from tobacco control organizations and departments of public health , and telephone inquiries to grocery stores and pharmacies ; details have been previously published [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] .

*** 1 member of this group had missing data for former tobacco use .
the study was approved by ucsf 's committee on human research , irb # 10 - 00850 .
we recruited participants by posting ads on craigslist , a classified ads website ; we also sent flyers to community centers and libraries for posting , and to members of tobacco control organizations , who agreed to post flyers in or near tobacco - free retailers on our behalf .
( for businesses in the san francisco bay area , we posted flyers ourselves in or near tobacco - free retailers. ) eligibility requirements were age 18 and above , ability to speak and read english , and patronage of a particular tobacco - free retailer .
participants called a toll - free number and were screened to ensure that they met these requirements .
see table 1 for information on the demographics of group participants .
focus group sessions typically took place in meeting rooms at public libraries located near the particular tobacco - free retailer under study .
they lasted 1.5 hours .
after a brief introduction , participants read and signed a consent form and agreed to audiotaping .
the discussion was moderated by one of three experienced researchers , including the first author , using a low moderator involvement approach ( i.e. , open - ended questions and minimal moderator - initiated direction ) [ 17 ] .
one other researcher was also typically present , sitting with participants , taking notes , and occasionally asking clarifying questions .
questions focused on participants' opinions about why a retailer would voluntarily end tobacco sales , characteristics of retailers that might choose to do so , and potential impacts of the decision , as well as participants' support for voluntary versus mandatory policies governing tobacco sales .
participants also completed a short survey that included demographic and tobacco use questions .
participants were compensated $ 40 .
audiotapes were transcribed by a professional transcribing service .
the first author checked the transcripts for accuracy , then coded them through a collaborative , inductive process involving data review and discussion of key points with two other researchers .
we created an initial set of codes collectively ; as data review progressed , we refined and added codes , re - coding earlier transcripts to reflect changes .
we used the software package nvivo9 for data management [ 18 ] .
both authors analyzed and interpreted the data using qualitative content analysis , which involves identifying themes or patterns in systematically coded text [ 19 ] .
we chose quotes that were illustrative of the themes we identified .
we identify speakers as male ( m ) or female ( f ) , a current tobacco user ( ctu ) , former tobacco user ( ftu ) , or never tobacco user ( ntu ) , and identify their particular focus group by number ( e.g. , fg1 ) .
results norms regarding where cigarettes are / should be sold participants considered cigarettes to be more or less integral to the identity of certain types of retailers , with california residents making the most distinctions .
participants in california focus groups generally agreed that it was inappropriate for pharmacies to sell tobacco products " because they 're supposed to promote health " ( f - ctu , fg1 ) .
several noted the contradictions between a pharmacy , which they saw as akin to a " doctor " or a " hospital " selling medicines to " cure people " while also " selling poison " that " ruin [ s ] people 's lives " or " kills you " ( m - ntu , fg7 ; m - ctu , fg3 ; f - ntu , fg5 ) .
one participant explained that " if i was a pharmacist , i would n't want to practice ...
in the same business that sold junk food and tobacco and alcohol ...
because it seems contradictory " ( f - ntu , fg2 ) .
it seemed " logical " then for pharmacies to choose not to sell tobacco products ( f - ntu , fg5 ) .
some new york and ohio focus group participants shared this view , but it was typically the minority opinion in these groups .
instead , these groups saw no particular difference between pharmacy and grocery store tobacco sales .
as one focus group participant explained , " i think the issue is still just the cigarettes .
i do n't think what else [ is ] in the store is really affecting [ it ]" ( m - ctu , fg12 ) .
a voluntary end to tobacco sales in a pharmacy - particularly , a large , chain pharmacy - was significant , if at all , for its impact on tobacco product accessibility , because " rite aid and cvs are almost on every single corner " ( f - ntu , fg15 ) .
if they were to end sales , smokers would have fewer places to buy cigarettes , and , according to some participants , " might be upset " ( f - ntu , fg15 ] .
grocery stores had a more complex relationship to tobacco sales .
although some focus group participants in all three states characterized grocery stores as " one stop shops " for convenient purchase of both food and tobacco ( m - ntu , fg7 ) , smokers ( or nonsmokers with friends who smoked ) pointed out that few people actually purchased tobacco at grocery stores because it was " really expensive " ( f - ntu , fg9 ; f - ftu , fg14 ; f - ctu , fg14 ; f - ctu , fg1 ; m - ctu , fg3 ) .
smokers also pointed out that it was actually inconvenient to purchase both tobacco and food at grocery stores , because it typically involved " two steps " : shoppers had to stand in one line to purchase food and another ( at the customer service counter ) to purchase tobacco ( f - ftu , fg13 ) .
regardless of their perspective on the convenience of purchasing tobacco in grocery store , focus group participants in all three states typically did not associate tobacco sales with grocery stores that sold organic , " fresh " , or other " healthy " products because , much like pharmacies and tobacco , those foods and tobacco did n't " go together " ( f - ctu , fg1 ; f - ntu , fg15 ; f - ntu , fg10 ; f - ntu , fg4 ; m - ftu , fg2 ) .
many participants ( including smokers ) were surprised to learn that the " healthy " grocery store they patronized had , until relatively recently , sold tobacco products , because , they said , doing so was inconsistent with the stores' apparent focus on healthy living .
they also explained that they had never noticed tobacco products for sale at these stores in the past , due , in part , to a lack of in - store advertising ; as one focus group participant pointed out , he had never seen " a big marlboro sign " at his grocery store when it still sold tobacco ( m - ntu , fg10 ) .
there was near universal agreement , however , that cigarettes were integral to the identity and perhaps the continued existence of convenience stores .
most participants could not imagine a convenience store not selling tobacco products , given how many shoppers bought cigarettes at such stores : " it 's almost unthinkable .
i just think that convenience stores would n't be around if they were n't selling cigarettes " ( f - ntu , fg2 ) .
if a convenience store were to end tobacco sales , it would " lose a lot of money " ( f - ftu , fg 11 ) or " have a going out of business sale " ( f - ctu , fg1 ) .
typically , at least one person in each group stated that smokers would be " upset " , ( m - ftu , fg14 ; m - ctu , fg12 ; f - ctu , fg10 ; f - ctu , fg8 ; m - ntu , fg7 ; f - ctu , fg6 ) " indignant " ( m - ntu , fg13 ) or possibly even " riot "( f - ntu , fg15 ) if a convenience store stopped selling tobacco products .
several went further , arguing that convenience stores " should " sell cigarettes : convenience stores should sell cigarettes because that 's your quick stop , and you go in there and get what you need and you go out .
facilitator : but may i ask why you used the word " should " - - they " should " sell cigarettes ?
because that 's where you go for such things , and you just know you go in there and you get your coffee and your newspaper - - if anyone still reads newspapers - - and your cigarettes .
it 's the american way .
( f - ntu fg4 ) in contrast to other focus group members who thought that convenience stores ought to sell tobacco products if they wanted to stay in business , this participant explicitly suggested that they should sell tobacco because people expected it. in discussing where cigarettes might or might not be sold , focus group participants also drew connections between neighborhood types and the likelihood of cigarette sales .
residents of predominantly poor or minority neighborhoods in california pointed out that nearly every corner featured a convenience store selling tobacco : we can literally walk from one store . .
.
one closes at 4:30 .
...
we have the schedules down pat. and there 's another store : if you want your cigarettes before 11:00 then you have to go there. and if not , if you miss the 11:00 , then there 's another one up the street .
( f - ctu , fg6 ) to " walk to [ a ] corner store and [ find ] they did n't sell tobacco " was simply a " dream " for some members of these communities ( m - ntu fg3 ) .
in addition , all but one focus group agreed that retailers who chose to no longer sell tobacco would likely be located in wealthier communities , as highlighted in this exchange among fg7 participants : speaker # 1 : i think [ a retailer who ends tobacco sales ] is not going to be [ in ] a real low - end area .
...
( m - ntu ) speaker # 2 : there 's probably a lot more [ tobacco ] sales in the lower end areas .
...
so they 'd be hurt more by not selling [ tobacco ] ( m - ntu ) .
speaker # 3 : yeah , ...
it would not be in the inner cities .
it 'd be [ affluent places ] like , ...
woodland hills or brentwood or beverly hills , ...
pacific palisades , people more upper class ( m - ntu ) .
indeed , studies have shown that tobacco retailers are concentrated in economically and socially deprived communities , and in neighborhoods with high proportions of african americans and hispanics [ 20 ] - [ 25 ] .
ending tobacco sales voluntarily is a normal and commendable practice california , new york and ohio focus group participants could easily imagine that retailers might choose to discontinue tobacco sales , with such a decision seemingly in the range of accepted practice .
they offered a variety of reasons why a retailer might do so , ranging from the pragmatic to the idealistic ; most were consistent with reasons offered by retailers themselves [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
pragmatic reasons for voluntarily ending tobacco sales included declining tobacco sales ; avoiding the regulations or other " hassles " associated with tobacco sales ( i.e. , checking id , controlling access , facing censure for getting caught selling tobacco to minors , or being drawn into future lawsuits against the tobacco industry ) ; responding to community pressure or local government incentive ; or trying to enhance the store 's image ( e.g. , by appealing to parents or health - conscious customers , or differentiating the store from larger corporate - owned chains ) .
idealistic reasons included retailers' concern for the health of the community ; personal experience with a tobacco - caused disease ; religious beliefs ; a desire to prevent children 's exposure to tobacco advertising ; or " guilt " over their association with the tobacco industry .
despite california participants' view of pharmacies and tobacco as incompatible for health reasons , like their counterparts in other states , they did not consider pharmacies more likely than grocery stores to end tobacco sales for idealistic reasons .
retailers' decision was also " normal " in the sense that it would most likely maintain the status quo for the business itself .
most focus group participants believed that customers who were smokers would continue to shop at tobacco - free retailers because tobacco products were unlikely to be the primary draw .
focus group members also argued that the new policy was unlikely to attract many new customers ; they assumed that most people were unaware of the policy ( just as many focus group members were ) , or , if people were aware , would not base decisions about where to shop on a store 's tobacco - free status .
as one california focus group participant explained , " i think most people are practical .
they go to the store they feel comfortable with , that 's close to them .
all these things that are pluses ...
like if cigarettes are gone , they either do n't know about it or they do n't really care " ( f - ftu , fg2 ) .
asked about the possible impact on smokers of a retailer voluntarily ending tobacco sales , participants typically focused on the inconvenience of having to shop elsewhere for cigarettes .
however , most groups did not consider this to be especially burdensome , as smokers were " used to being inconvenienced " ( m - ntu fg2 ) .
" what are you going to do ?
you 're going to go somewhere else , to another store that does have [ cigarettes ] .
so i do n't think it 's that big of a deal " ( f - ctu , fg6 ) .
nearly everyone regarded retailers' decision to discontinue tobacco sales as commendable .
many focus group participants saw the decision as good for public health in general , noting , for example , that " any institution or place that sells less poison is ...
good for the overall public " ( f - ftu , fg2 ) .
another participant saw the decision as a choice for the " greater good " , because " all of society pays for the burdens of people who are sick or afflicted " by tobacco - caused disease ( f - ntu fg10 ) .
deciding to end tobacco sales was seen as reflecting business owners' concern for customers' health .
these businesses were " not taking advantage of smokers who are addicted " ( f - ntu , fg9 ) ; they cared " more about health than making money " ( f - ntu , fg4 ) .
among the handful of people who did not voice support , most had no opinion , or expressed indifference , viewing it as a " nice gesture " that was not " particularly meaningful " ( m - ntu , fg7 ) .
only a small number were opposed , believing that it would spark a trend that would make cigarettes harder to find and more expensive , or rejecting the policy as overly paternalistic .
government limits on tobacco sales are ( mostly ) a normal and commendable practice most ( 11 of 15 ) focus groups supported laws like those passed in san francisco and several massachusetts localities prohibiting pharmacy tobacco sales .
some participants saw such laws as leveling the playing field for all pharmacies , preventing pharmacies that voluntarily chose to stop selling tobacco from losing customers to pharmacies that continued to sell .
others thought these laws would make it harder for kids and adults to obtain tobacco , " kind of like raising the taxes on [ cigarettes ]" ( f - ctu , fg8 ) , and thereby have a broader impact on smoking prevalence than strictly voluntary policies .
smokers in these groups also supported mandatory policies partly because they knew they would not impede their ability to buy tobacco ; one explained that " if there 's prohibition lurking , then i 'll have a different tune to sing to you .
but i like it because it protects the youth " ( m - ctu , fg7 ) .
these groups also agreed with the broader proposition that it made sense for governments to determine where cigarettes were sold , making comparisons to existing laws governing alcohol sales or public place smoking with which they were familiar and comfortable .
in four focus groups , two in california and two in ohio , opposition to laws prohibiting pharmacy tobacco sales dominated discussions , primarily based on " slippery slope " fears .
for example , one california smoker stated that i do n't like it. i think it 's infringing on my personal choice , and my freedom , and ...
pursuit of happiness .... first they 're starting with pharmacies , then after that 's rolled in and everyone 's accepting that , they 're going to start doing more , grocery stores and convenience stores and everything .
san francisco is a trend - maker , and ...
i believe that 's what they 're going to ... do .
( f - ctu , fg1 ) ultimately , she feared , smoking itself would be outlawed .
an ohio participant asked " what 's the next ban going to be ? ?
( f - ntu , fg 15 ) , and another suggested it would be a ban on " 16 ounce or whatever it is " sodas , as proposed in new york ( f - ctu , fg15 ) .
another commonly voiced objection was the belief that such a law " infring [ ed ] on ...
public rights " ( m - ftu , fg1 ) or was an example of " the government sticking their nose in and taking more of our rights away " ( f - ntu , fg15 ) .
these groups thought that the decision to sell or not to sell tobacco should rest entirely with the retailer , as illustrated in the following discussion among participants of fg15 : moderator : does it make sense to have some sort of law or regulation that says you can sell tobacco here , but not here ? or should it just be completely up to the retailer ?
speaker # 1 : retailer ( f - ntu ) .
speaker # 2 : retailer ( m - ctu ) .
speaker # 3 : i 'm going with the retailer , yeah ( f - ctu ) .
speaker # 4 : retailer ( f - ntu ) .
moderator : okay .
so , if you want to sell it in a furniture store , you should - - speaker # 4 : that 's up to the business .
speaker # 2 : i believe it should be up to the business .
speaker # 4 : you have a right to sell whatever is legal in a business .
moderator : all right .
the baby clothes store , they could sell ?
speaker # 4 : if they wanted to sell cigarettes , it does n't mean i 'll shop there , but that 's their right to sell them .
speaker # 2 : that 's a bit of a stretch !
i do n't think they would have many customers .
speaker # 4 : but it 's their right to decide as a business if they want to do it or not .
even within this discussion in which participants supported the idea that there should be no government limits on tobacco outlets , community norms regarding what type of product cigarettes were and where they should and should not be sold were implied .
the speakers' responses suggested that cigarettes and baby things were , in fact , incompatible products to sell together , and that a baby clothes shop breaching this norm might risk failure .
banning tobacco sales is not a community norm the idea of a community banning tobacco sales entirely typically brought much more mixed responses within focus groups ( although 3 groups - 2 in california and 1 in new york - - were uniformly enthusiastic about the idea , and 2 - both in ohio - - were uniformly opposed ) .
for many , whether they supported the idea or not , it was impossible to imagine a community banning tobacco sales .
some simply asserted that it " sounds like a fairytale " ( f - ftu , fg2 ) or was " not possible " ( f - ntu , fg2 ) .
others offered reasons why a tobacco sales ban was unimaginable , including a sense that a ban was an extreme step that had the potential to create " chaos " or " anarchy " ( f - ftu , fg4 ) .
for example , a smoker stated that " because ...
nicotine is so addictive , it just does n't seem realistic that they could just completely ban the selling of tobacco products .
...
i think a lot of people would be running around , you know , complete chaos. and it just would n't be a pretty sight " ( m - ctu , fg9 ) .
others thought that a ban would " never happen " because governments made too much money from tobacco taxes or because politicians relied on tobacco industry campaign contributions ( f - ftu , fg4 ; f - ftu , fg9 ) .
some focus group participants were willing to accept that a community might ban tobacco sales , but expressed reservations about such a step , believing that a ban would not work as intended , or that it should be introduced gradually , after a " national dialogue " ( f - ntu , fg3 ) .
among those who saw a ban as ineffective , several drew parallels with the failure of alcohol prohibition in the 1920s to curb alcohol consumption , or simply asserted that people would " still smoke " ( m - ntu , fg3 ) finding " a way to get around [ the law ] in one way , shape , or form " ( m - ntu , fg8 ) .
those who expressed unmitigated support for the idea of a community banning tobacco sales tended to be nonsmokers ; several justified their support by drawing parallels to the acceptability of banning illicit drugs .
for example , one participant noted that " we 're not allowing heroin to be sold " ( f - ntu , fg9 ) , while another argued that " the little disclaimer on the [ cigarette ] packs about '[ smoking ] causes this and this and this ,' that does n't seem to sway anybody .
...
you have to force them for the greater good just like drugs " ( m - ntu , fg13 ) .
those who rejected the idea of a tobacco sales ban were a mix of smokers and nonsmokers ; the reasons for their opposition centered on a dislike of " big government " , a denial of " choice " , or a conviction that a ban would lead to black markets and possibly violence .
limitations this study has several limitations .
focus group members were a self - selected , non - representative sample ; thus , our findings cannot be generalized to all customers of retailers who voluntarily ended tobacco sales .
focus groups were also conducted in only three states , with approximately half of the groups based in california .
our choice of states was influenced both by our awareness of particular retailers who had ended tobacco sales voluntarily , and the willingness of those retailers to be interviewed .
thus , customers of tobacco - free retailers in other states may have different perspectives .
discussion this study suggests that there are existing community norms regarding where cigarettes should or should not be sold , even in states with very different political climates regarding government regulation .
the notion that cigarettes should not be sold in stores focused on healthy products was strongest in california , where focus group participants considered both pharmacies and grocery stores selling organic foods to be incompatible with selling cigarettes .
however , in new york and ohio , pharmacy sales were not consistently regarded as violating community norms .
since a recent , hard - fought battle to ban cigarette sales in all san francisco pharmacies garnered considerable media coverage , it may be that the vigorous debates around this policy initiative , including coverage of the tobacco industry lawsuit challenging it , shifted opinions in california .
california residents already have been exposed to two decades of mass media campaigns aimed at changing views of both smoking and the tobacco industry [ 26 ] , and generally have negative perceptions of tobacco companies [ 27 ] .
in addition , california has the second lowest adult smoking prevalence in the united states [ 28 ] , which itself influences broader community norms about tobacco use .
even when participants argued against any government limits on tobacco sales , they made distinctions indicating that cigarettes were not appropriate products to sell everywhere .
this suggests that targeted media campaigns problematizing the ubiquitous presence of cigarettes , especially in stores frequented by children or selling products for children , may be helpful in shifting norms and consistent with community expectations .
in each state , it was regarded as " normal " and acceptable for some stores ( particularly pharmacies and grocery stores ) to want to stop selling tobacco .
participants were able to readily identify and support possible rationales for doing so , including contributing to public health and to the image of the stores as retailers who cared about their customers .
even smokers indicated acceptance of such voluntary decisions .
however , for convenience stores to stop selling tobacco was widely regarded as improbable , even unimaginable at this point .
if jurisdictions wish to work to reduce the number and density of tobacco outlets , starting with pharmacies and grocery stores seems the most expedient route .
in addition to likely community support , these retailers may be the most receptive to removing tobacco from their shelves .
pharmacists have long favored ending tobacco sales [ 13 ] , [ 29 ] - [ 34 ] , and cvs' decision to do so ( and the positive press it has generated for the company ) [ 35 ] can be held up as a model .
for grocery stores , tobacco may no longer be a major profit item [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] ; owners may be readily persuaded to replace it with a potentially more lucrative product. by contrast , community acceptance of tobacco sales in convenience stores , coupled with such stores' reliance on tobacco sales to generate profits [ 36 ] and strong relationship with the tobacco industry [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] , may engender more opposition to efforts to limit their sales .
views on government 's role in setting limits on where cigarettes could be sold varied by state , with the more pro - regulatory politics of california and new york and the more anti - regulatory politics of ohio reflected in group discussions .
as with other tobacco control policies [ 39 ] , states with pro - regulatory climates are likely to take the lead on addressing the retail sales of cigarettes , with others following ( if at all ) after the policies have been tested in several states and survived any legal challenges from tobacco companies .
for example , limiting tobacco sales to state - run outlets , as has been done with alcohol in some states [ 40 ] may be an acceptable extension in such states .
banning tobacco sales entirely is not yet normative .
this finding is not surprising , as it is very rare that any public health or government official has suggested such a thing , and to do so has in the past been to court censure [ 41 ] .
focus group participants for the most part could not even imagine it. however , some did suggest that after more public " dialogue " , such a step might be introduced in a phased way .
as the u.s. moves toward planning for a tobacco endgame , the idea of " phasing out cigarettes " may be a way to shift social norms by comparing cigarettes with other deadly products that have been phased out of use .
fear of extreme reactions (" riots ") has been raised in conjunction with the introduction of almost every important tobacco control policy to date , and has never materialized , partly because most smokers want to quit .
there is emerging evidence that smokers support such policies because they help them stop smoking [ 42 ] .
conclusion excluding tobacco sales from the " charmed circle " of desirable , socially acceptable retail practice and thereby limiting the ubiquitous availability of tobacco products is key to ending the tobacco epidemic [ 4 ] .
some limits on tobacco sales appear to be normative from the perspective of community members ; others may become so by drawing connections to products that are already subject to restrictions or that have been eliminated entirely .
the " national dialogue " about how to bring the tobacco epidemic to an end should include discussion of how to further reduce the number of tobacco retail outlets .

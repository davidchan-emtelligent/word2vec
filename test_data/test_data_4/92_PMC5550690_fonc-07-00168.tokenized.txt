pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against her2 .
diarrhea and abdominal pain are common adverse events of pertuzumab - based therapy , occurring in almost 70 % of patients .
the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicities intensifies when pertuzumab is given in combination with chemotherapy .
rifaximin , a non - absorbable oral antibiotic , may provide symptomatic relief in patients with refractory gastrointestinal toxicities from pertuzumab - based therapy beyond standard routine antidiarrheal medications .
we present a case of her2 - related therapy - induced diarrhea and abdominal pain managed successfully with rifaximin .
her2 positive breast cancer rifaximin pertuzumab trastuzumab diarrhea gastrointestinal toxicities introduction a 53 - year - old woman was diagnosed with stage iia ( pt2 n0 m0 ) grade 3 invasive ducal carcinoma measuring 3 cm with lymphovascular invasion but negative four resected axillary lymph nodes .
further immunohistochemistry showed that both estrogen and progesterone receptors were focally positive at 10 % and her2 was overexpressed (+ 3 ) .
since the tumor was larger than 2 cm and her2 was overexpressed , treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy with tch + p regimen as described in the tryphaena trial was recommended ( 1 ) .
this regimen included docetaxel 75 mg / m2 , carboplatin auc 6 , trastuzumab loading dose 8 mg / kg followed by 6 mg / kg every 3 weeks , and pertuzumab 840 mg loading followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks .
after the first cycle of tch + p , she developed severe abdominal pain and cramping ( 7 - 8 / 10 pain scale ) and profuse grade 3 watery diarrheas .
despite alternating loperamide and diphenoxylate / atropine , her symptoms continued to worsen , and she had to visit the emergency department .
these symptoms , particularly abdominal cramping , continued to worsen during the subsequent cycles of chemotherapy .
she was also started on hyoscyamine and probiotics with minimal relief .
given the fact that she did not respond to standard antidiarrheal and antispasmodic therapies , the patient was started on rifaximin 550 mg oral daily for 7 days .
within a few days of initiation of rifaximin , her abdominal pain , cramping , and diarrhea improved .
the patient was able to continue and complete her planned six cycles of tch + p adjuvant chemotherapy without dose reduction or delay .
written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report .
background her2 - directed therapies have revolutionized the treatment outcome for patients with her2 - positive breast cancer ( 2 ) .
one such successful therapy is pertuzumab , a monoclonal antibody that disrupts heterodimerization of her2 ( 3 ) .
however , gastrointestinal toxicities are common adverse events of pertuzumab .
these toxicities can be debilitating and lead to unnecessary dose reduction , treatment interruption , and premature discontinuation , which can result in detrimental outcome .
the pharmacologic approaches commonly used to treat pertuzumab - induced gastrointestinal toxicities ( pigt ) include general antidiarrheal and antispasmodic agents , such as loperamide , diphenoxylate - atropine , hyoscyamine , etc .
rifaximin is a non - absorbable oral antibiotic currently approved to be used for irritable bowel syndrome ( ibs ) with diarrhea ( 4 ) .
we present a case with early stage her2 - positive breast cancer , with pigt refractory to standard antidiarrheal and antispasmodic agents , who was successfully treated with rifaximin .
discussion pertuzumab - induced gastrointestinal toxicities are common adverse events of pertuzumab reported in almost 70 % of patients receiving pertuzumab , which appear to intensify when pertuzumab is given in combination with chemotherapy .
in the pivotal phase iii cleopatra trial , which evaluated pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in patients with metastatic her2 - positive breast cancer , all - grade diarrhea was reported in 66.8 % of patients receiving pertuzumab compared to 46.3 % of patients receiving docetaxel and trastuzumab with placebo .
most diarrheas were grade 1 or 2 , and the incidence of grade 3 or higher diarrhea only occurred in 7.9 % of patients receiving pertuzumab compared to 5 % receiving placebo ( 5 ) .
incidence of all - grade diarrheas was lower after docetaxel was discontinued , with 28.1 % in pertuzumab group compared to 14.2 % in placebo group ( 6 ) .
among patients with early stage her2 - positive breast cancer , all - grade diarrheas have been reported in the range of 43 - 72.4 % in patients receiving pertuzumab combination ( 1 , 7 ) .
incidence of all - grade diarrheas was highest in the tch + p regimen in the tryphaena trial , 72.4 % had all - grade diarrhea and 11.8 % of those patients had grade 3 diarrhea or higher .
incidence of all - grade diarrheas in the other two arms was 61.1 % ( 4.2 % >= grade 3 ) with 5 - fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide ( fec ) followed by docetaxel ( t ) , with trastuzumab ( h ) and pertuzumab ( p ) given concurrently throughout ( fec + h + p x 3 - - > t + h + p x 3 ) and 61.3 % ( 5.3 % >= grade 3 ) with fec followed by t + h + p ( fec x 3 - - > t + h + p x 3 ) arm .
incidence of diarrhea in the phase ii neosphere trial was similar to that in the tryphaena trial .
incidence of all - grade diarrheas was 51 % ( 7 % >= grade 3 ) with pertuzumab , trastuzumab , and docetaxel and 56 % ( 5 % >= grade 3 ) with pertuzumab and docetaxel compared to 38 % ( 4 % >= grade 3 ) with trastuzumab and docetaxel without pertuzumab .
however , incidence of all - grade diarrheas was relatively higher at 43 % ( 3 % >= grade 3 ) with pertuzumab and trastuzumab without chemotherapy .
the recent combined analysis of the cleopatra , neosphere , and tryphaena trials demonstrated that the incidence of all - grade diarrheas across all studies ranged from 28 - 72 % in the pertuzumab - based treatment arms ( 8 ) .
most diarrheal episodes were grade 1 ( range 21 - 54 %) and grade 2 ( range 8 - 37 %) .
incidence of grade 3 ( range 0 - 12 %) was rarer ; there were no grade 4 reported in these 3 trials .
incidence of diarrhea was highest during the first pertuzumab - containing cycle and decreased in subsequent treatments .
there was no relationship between pre - existing gastrointestinal comorbidities , such as ibs , colitis , and crohn 's disease , and diarrheal episodes were observed across all studies .
however , only 2 % of patients enrolled in these three trials had pre - existing gastrointestinal comorbidities .
in the cleopatra trial , incidence of all - grade diarrheas was reported to be similar among patients younger than 65 years vs. those 65 years or older .
however , grade 3 or higher diarrhea was higher among patients 65 years old or older ( 19 %) than in patients younger than 65 ( 8 %) .
elderly patients were more likely to delay treatment ( 15 % pertuzumab arm vs. 5 % control arm ) or discontinue treatment ( 5 % pertuzumab arm vs. 1 % control arm ) .
generally , chemotherapy - induced diarrhea is believed to result from mucosal injury .
however , there are several potential mechanisms for diarrhea associated with epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr )/ her2 signaling blockade , including dysregulation of ion channels in intestinal epithelial cells , which leads to excess chloride secretion ; altered gut motility ; changes in intestinal microbiome , including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( sibo ) ; and altered nutrient metabolism ( 9 , 10 ) .
pharmacologic approaches to treat pigt are not specific and mainly focus on symptomatic relief .
in the previous combined analysis of the cleopatra , neosphere , and tryphaena trials , the majority of patients who developed pertuzumab - induced diarrhea were treated with loperamide ( 8 ) .
besides loperamide , other managements recommended by the national comprehensive cancer network and standard practice guidelines ( 11 , 12 ) for treating chemotherapy or anti - egfr - associated diarrhea , are aggressive rehydration , codeine , and stool culture to rule out the possibility of infection .
despite these interventions , dose delays or discontinuations due to diarrhea still occurred in up to 8 % of patients receiving pertuzumab .
importantly , dose reductions of pertuzumab were not permitted in the cleopatra , neosphere , and tryphaena trials and have not been recommended for treatment of pigt ( 8 ) .
rifaximin is a semisynthetic derivation of rifampin that inhibits bacterial rna synthesis by binding to beta - subunit of bacterial dna - dependent rna polymerase ( 13 ) .
rifaximin inhibits bacterial growth and modulates gut microbiota composition and is currently approved for treatment of ibs with diarrhea ( 4 ) , hepatic encephalopathy ( 14 ) , and traveler 's diarrhea .
additionally , rifaximin is being used off - label for clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea .
sibo is a condition in which abnormally large amounts of non - native or native bacteria are present in the small intestine (> 105 coliforms / ml ) ( 15 ) .
similar to what has been reported in ibs literature , gastrointestinal problems with diarrhea , flatulence , bloating , and pain in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy are believed to be commonly caused by sibo ( 16 ) .
however , the mechanisms of pigt remain largely unknown .
several possible mechanisms have been proposed for egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor - induced diarrhea , including negative regulation of chloride secretion causing secretory diarrhea ( 17 ) , inhibition of egfr signaling reducing the growth and impairing intestinal epithelium causing mucosal atrophy ( 18 ) , altered gut motility , colonic crypt damage , changes in the gut microbiome , and altered colonic transport ( 19 ) .
interestingly , in the skin toxicity evaluation protocol with panitumumab trial , prophylactic use of oral antibiotic ( doxycycline 100 mg twice daily ) to prevent skin toxicity from panitumumab , a monoclonal antibody against egfr , also showed a significant reduction in all - grade diarrhea ( 56 vs. 85 % with doxycycline ) ( 20 ) .
these data support the possibility of sibo as a mechanism of diarrhea associated with panitumumab .
based on these data and the fact that pigt are much more common when given in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy , we hypothesize that sibo may be a main mechanism of pigt .
here , we report a case of a patient with severe , refractory pigt despite standard antidiarrheal and antispasmodic therapies , who was successfully treated with rifaximin .
more importantly , the patient was able to complete her necessary therapy as planned without further dose reduction or delay .
additional studies are needed to evaluate the role of rifaximin in treating or preventing pigt .
concluding remarks pertuzumab - induced gastrointestinal toxicities are common adverse events , affecting up to two - thirds of patients receiving this therapy .
the incidence of pigt is higher when pertuzumab is given in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy .
despite standard interventions , dose delays or discontinuations due to diarrhea still occurred in a significant number of patients receiving pertuzumab .
studies suggest that sibo may be one of the mechanisms for pigt .
rifaximin may provide a treatment option for patients with refractory pigt .
further studies are needed to determine its safety , tolerability , efficacy , and ability to prevent dose reduction or delay in patients receiving pertuzumab - based chemotherapy .

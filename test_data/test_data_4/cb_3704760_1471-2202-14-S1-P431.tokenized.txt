how are estimates of neural circuits impacted by neuronal biophysics and particular stimuli employed in experiments [ 1 ] ?
what is a suitable metric to assess the goodness of the identified circuit parameters [ 1,2 ] ?
how can this metric be extended from a single neuron to a circuit consisting of thousands of neurons ?
we report new insights obtained by asking these questions in the rigorous context of channel identification / time encoding and the massively parallel models of biophysical circuits of the early visual system [ 3,4 ] .
our approach builds on the observation that during an experiment , an entire neural circuit is projected onto the space of input signals , with the circuit projection intuitively determined by the way the input stimuli explore the functional characteristics of that circuit .
assuming the general outline of the circuit architecture is known , we identify the projection of the encoding circuit whose receptive fields and parameters of individual neurons are unknown .
we demonstrate that the projection ( i.e. , each identified parameter ) is stimulus - dependent and derive a quantitative description of this dependence in the parameter space .
we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis and derive conditions under which the distance between the original and identified parameters can be made arbitrarily small .
after identification , one typically evaluates the estimated parameters by how well individual model neurons predict recorded responses [ 1,2 ] .
although such evaluation in the spike - train domain ( space ) can be useful , it is often insufficient , especially in a population encoding setting .
we argue that it is beneficial to evaluate the identified circuit in the stimulus space by looking at the amount of information that the spike train ensemble retains about the stimulus .
specifically , by employing a nonlinear decoder , we reconstruct novel stimuli sensed by the circuit ( i.e. , not necessarily the original stimuli ) .
in contrast to linear decoders applied to firing rates of a small population of neurons [ 5,6 ] , our nonlinear decoder works directly with spike times produced by thousands of neurons and is capable of high - fidelity reconstruction of the sensed stimulus .
thus , evaluation of the entire identified neural circuit is reduced to intuitive comparisons in the stimulus space , thereby augmenting the usual neuron - by - neuron comparison in the spike - train space .
for images and video , such an evaluation can be visually performed .
we present extensive simulation results for massively parallel neural circuits that were identified using natural video with the aid of gpu computing .
first , we show that for a faithful encoding model , high quality reconstruction of visual stimuli from spike trains of biophysical neurons is possible .
the quality of the decoded video improves with the length of stimuli used in identification , implying a higher accuracy of neural circuit identification. by comparing the reconstructed stimulus with the original , we then demonstrate an algorithm for determining if additional experiments need to be carried out .
finally , we explore the use of the latter algorithm in the case of unobservable / missing circuit outputs and as a means of exploring the circuit function .

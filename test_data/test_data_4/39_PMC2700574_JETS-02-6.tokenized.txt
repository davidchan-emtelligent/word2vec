study objective : despite causing significant morbidity throughout the mountainous regions of the world , the pathophysiology of acute mountain sickness ( ams ) remains poorly understood .
this study aims to improve the understanding of altitude illness by determining if vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) plays a role in the development of ams .
the purpose of this study was to determine if elevated plasma vegf correlates with increased symptoms of ams at high altitude .
patients and methods : this is a prospective study of a cohort of healthy climbers on denali ( mount mckinley ) in alaska at 14 , 200 feet .
baseline demographics , medications , rates of ascent , and ams scores were recorded .
pulse oximetry measurements and venous blood samples were obtained .
comparisons were made between mountaineers with and without ams .
results : seventy - two climbers were approached for participation in the study ; 21 ( 29 %) refused. of the 51 climbers participating in the study , 14 subjects ( 27.5 %) had symptoms of ams and 37 subjects ( 72.5 %) were free of symptoms of ams .
plasma vegf levels were 79.14 pg / dl ( sd : 121.44 ) and 57.57pg / dl ( sd : 102.71 ) in the ams and non - ams groups , respectively .
these results were nonsignificant .
similarly , comparison of sex , age , rate of ascent , pulse oximetry values , or history of altitude illness did not reveal significant differences between the ams and non - ams groups .
conclusion : this study does not provide evidence in support of the theory that plasma vegf correlates with symptoms of ams .
acute mountain sickness high altitude illness vascular endothelial growth factor introduction during ascent to high altitudes , climbers , skiers , trekkers , and other outdoor enthusiasts experience a variety of high altitude illnesses .
these include acute mountain sickness ( ams ) , high - altitude cerebral edema ( hace ) , and high - altitude pulmonary edema ( hape ). by far the most common of these conditions , ams is a clinical syndrome characterized by headache , nausea , vomiting , lethargy , irritability , and sleep disturbances ; on occasion , it leads on to hace .
although the diagnosis , treatment , and prevention of this illness are quite well described , the pathophysiology of ams remains poorly understood. [ 1 ] hace and ams are closely related illnesses , with hace being the clinical and pathophysiologic end - stage of ams .
like the initial stages of hace , moderate and severe ams is characterized by progressive vasogenic cerebral edema. [ 2 ] this is an important distinction , for while vasogenic cerebral edema is secondary to capillary leak , cytotoxic ( intracellular ) cerebral edema is secondary to cell injury and death .
cerebral hemodynamic dysregulation , leading to increased cerebral capillary pressures and depression of normal cerebral vascular auto - regulation , likely plays an important role in the development of cerebral edema. [ 3 ] however , these factors alone are not considered sufficient ,[ 4 ] and additional neurohumoral mediators are believed to play a prominent role in the development of increased capillary permeability. [ 1 ] speculation has focused on several possible mediators , most notably inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) .
this study focuses on the role of vegf in ams .
vegf , previously known as vascular permeability factor , is an endothelial - specific mitogen essential for the process of angiogenesis .
vegf exerts its effect by disrupting basement membrane ligans , thus increasing capillary permeability and leading to plasma leak from capillaries. [ 5 ] as has been documented widely in the literature , animal and in vitro studies demonstrate a consistent up - regulation of vegf in endothelial tissues that are subject to hypoxic conditions. [ 6 - 8 ] also of interest is the finding that corticosteroids , which are potent down - regulators of vegf expression in vitro ,[ 9 ] are highly effective in the prevention and treatment of ams and hace. [ 10 ] the aim of this study was to determine if vegf levels at high altitude are increased in individuals with symptoms of ams as compared to individuals without ams .
patients and methods study design this was an observational , prospective cohort study utilizing a convenience sample of subjects .
the study was conducted from may 23rd to june 23rd , 2002 .
the institutional review board ( irb ) of yale university approved the study .
the united states department of the interior and the national park service authorized a scientific research permit .
study setting and participants climbers were invited to participate in the study while acclimatizing at the 14,200 - foot camp on the west buttress route of denali ( mount mckinley , alaska ) .
all climbers were on their way up the mountain and had been acclimatizing at this elevation for a minimum of 24 h to avoid confusing symptoms of ams with that of dehydration or exhaustion .
no climbers descending the mountain were included in the study .
all subjects signed irb - approved consent forms .
exclusion criteria included self - reported pregnancy , concurrent illness ( other than altitude - related illnesses ) , age less that 18 years , and recent corticosteroid use .
study protocol subjects provided demographic data and completed a standard lake louise ams score worksheet as described by the lake louise consensus on the definition and quantification of altitude illness. [ 11 ] ascent profile , i.e. , the time taken for ascent from the 7,200 - feet base camp to 14,200 feet , was self - reported .
oxygen saturation was determined using a portable pulse oximeter .
each subject provided 5 ml of venous blood , which was collected in citrate - containing phlebotomy tubes .
using a national park service ( nps ) solar energy source , which could only be utilized during sunny weather , the samples were centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min .
the serum supernatant was decanted into clean phlebotomy tubes and kept frozen .
plasma vegf , rather than serum vegf , was measured to avoid cross - contamination with leukocyte or platelet vegf. [ 12 ] the samples were kept frozen until analysis in new haven , ct. free plasma vegf levels were determined using a standard commercial vegf enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( r and d systems inc. , minneapolis , mn , usa ) .
all sample assays were run in duplicate .
statistical analysis spss , version 12.0 , was used for data analysis .
categorical data were compared using chi - square analysis .
continuous data means were compared using independent samples t - tests .
p - values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
results there were 51 subjects enrolled in the study , 14 with ams and 37 without ams .
twenty - one climbers refused enrollment .
the reasons for refusal were twofold : dislike of venipuncture and concerns regarding subsequent decreased oxygen - carrying capacity .
the mean age , sex , rate of ascent , incidence of prior high altitude illnesses , and plasma vegf levels are presented [ table 1 ] .
the 95 % confidence limits for the difference in mean vegf levels between the ams and non - ams groups were not statistically significant .
similarly , none of the other measured variables including sex , age , rate of ascent , oxygen saturation , or history of previous symptoms were significantly different between the ams and non - ams groups table 1 demographics and data analysis of subjects ams n = 14 non - ams n = 37 significance sex n (%) females 1 ( 7.1 ) 8 ( 21.6 ) ns males 13 ( 92.9 ) 29 ( 78.4 ) ns age m years ( sd ) 34.4 ( 7.29 ) 32.9 ( 8.51 ) ns rate of ascent m days ( sd ) 7.57 ( 2.43 ) 8.68 ( 2.64 ) ns pulse oximetry m % ( sd ) 83.3 ( 4.54 ) 85.8 ( 3.59 ) ns previous sx n (%) 8 ( 57.2 ) 11 ( 29.7 ) ns vefg m pg / ml ( sd ) 79.14 ( 121.44 ) 57.57 ( 102.71 ) ns we also did a review of subjects taking prophylactic acetazolamide ( n = 5 ) , but this did not reveal a statistically significant difference in their plasma vegf levels .
twenty percent ( 1 / 5 subjects ) of these climbers developed symptoms of ams .
similarly , subjects taking prophylactic ginkgo biloba ( n = 3 ) did not reveal any significant difference in their plasma vegf levels .
sixty - six percent ( 2 / 3 subjects ) had symptoms of ams although , clearly , little generalization can be made .
discussion this study fails to identify an increase in plasma vegf levels in subjects with ams ; this finding echoes several other small studies that reached similar conclusions. [ 14 - 16 ] these human studies conducted at high altitudes have failed to reach a consensus regarding the role of vegf in ams and , further , whether vegf levels do actually increase at high altitude .
maloney et al. showed a trend toward decreased plasma vegf levels at high altitude , but they did not document any significant difference in vegf levels between subjects with and without ams .
gunga et al. showed a significant decrease in plasma vegf levels in marathon runners following a high - altitude marathon to an elevation of 4722 meters .
this study did not evaluate for presence of ams .
walter et al. found a significant increase in both arterial and mixed venous vegf levels in 14 subjects ascending to an elevation of 4,559 meters .
however , there was no significant difference in vegf levels between the ams and non - ams groups .
in summary , despite the mixed results regarding changes in plasma vegf levels at high altitude , no study has documented a statistically significant correlation between ams and elevated plasma vegf , the primary point of interest in this study .
these reports are of interest given the otherwise robust evidence supporting the theories that hypoxia stimulates vegf production and , further , that vegf is a powerful mediator of capillary permeability .
possible explanations for the contradictory nature of these findings include , most notably , the questionable validity of the assumption that peripheral ( or even central ) plasma vegf levels reflect local intracerebral vegf concentrations .
as was elegantly determined by walter et al. , circulating vegf levels can be highly variable depending upon the vascular site from which blood was obtained , with arterial blood having consistently higher levels than either mixed venous or capillary samples .
thus , a reasonable question would be whether cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) would better reflect local intracerebral vegf concentrations ; however , there are obvious difficulties associated with conducting a study to determine this in humans .
the pre - study assumption of this author was that despite the possibility of a poor correlation between intracerebral vegf and serum vegf concentrations , a discernable and consistent relationship may exist and would provide supporting evidence for a role of vegf in ams ( and thus , presumably , in hace ) .
a single previous study supports the assumption that local tissue and circulating vegf levels are correlated [ 17 ] ; it is questionable , however , whether these findings could be extrapolated to the central nervous system .
another possible , and interesting , explanation for the lack of in vivo hypoxia - induced plasma vegf production is based on several studies that indicate that acidosis plays a role in the stimulation of vegf synthesis and expression. [ 18 - 21 ] in fact , these studies promote the theory that acidosis and hypoxia independently up - regulate vegf production .
given that hyperventilation , and the subsequent respiratory alkalosis , is an integral part of human high - altitude physiology , one may speculate on an inhibitory role of alkalemia on vegf expression .
examining venous ph in concert with serum vegf may shed light on the role alkalemia plays in the in vivo production of circulating vegf. of course , this would not answer the question of whether local , intracerebral ph levels are significantly different from the serum ph and whether local intracranial vegf production is significantly different from systemic production .
the majority of the vegf - related literature provides promising theoretical evidence for a role of vegf in moderate to severe ams and hace .
however , the few high - altitude human studies that have been conducted have failed to support this assumption .
certainly , this may be due to the fact that vegf does not , in fact , play a role in the pathophysiological changes in ams and hace .
however , there are other factors to be considered before discarding the theory of vegf as a central mediator in this process .
these considerations have been described above , but all rest on the assumption that current human studies lack the methodological sophistication necessary to adequately assess vegf levels in the region of interest , namely the brain .
limitations there are several limitations to this study .
first , 21 of 72 climbers ( 29.2 %) refused enrollment in the study .
the lack of consecutive enrollment may have selected for healthier subjects , i.e. , those less likely to have symptoms of ams .
second , our dependence on solar energy to power the centrifuge meant that subjects could only be enrolled during periods of sunny weather .
due to the unstable weather during the 2002 climbing season , 16 of 25 days ( 64 %) were partially or completely unsuitable for subject enrolment .
third , despite an attempt to standardize the documentation of the symptomatology , self - reporting of ams symptoms is subjective and , given the small study population , the findings may not be generalizabile .
finally , given the large range , and thus standard deviation , of serum vegf in healthy subjects at sea level ,[ 13 ] it may be difficult to determine significance without a large study size or matched controls .
conclusion this study does not support the hypothesis that serum vegf levels correlate with symptoms of ams .
source of support : nil .
conflict of interest : none declared .

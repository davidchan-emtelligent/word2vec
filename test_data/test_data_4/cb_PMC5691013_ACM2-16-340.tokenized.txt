this work describes the replacement of tissue phantom ratio ( tpr ) measurements with beam profile flatness measurements to determine photon beam quality during routine quality assurance ( qa ) measurements .
to achieve this , a relationship was derived between the existing tpr15 / 5 energy metric and beam flatness , to provide baseline values and clinically relevant tolerances .
the beam quality was varied around two nominal beam energy values for four matched elekta linear accelerators ( linacs ) by varying the bending magnet currents and reoptimizing the beam .
for each adjusted beam quality the tpr15 / 5 was measured using an ionization chamber and solid water phantom .
two metrics of beam flatness were evaluated using two identical commercial ionization chamber arrays .
a linear relationship was found between tpr15 / 5 and both metrics of flatness , for both nominal energies and on all linacs .
baseline diagonal flatness ( fdn ) values were measured to be 103.0 % ( ranging from 102.5 % to 103.8 %) for 6 mv and 102.7 % ( ranging from 102.6 % to 102.8 %) for 10 mv across all four linacs .
clinically acceptable tolerances of +/ - 2 % for 6 mv , and +/ - 2 % for 10 mv , were derived to equate to the current tpr15 / 5 clinical tolerance of +/ - 0.5 % .
small variations in the baseline diagonal flatness values were observed between ionization chamber arrays ; however , the rate of change of tpr15 / 5 with diagonal flatness was found to remain within experimental uncertainty .
measurements of beam flatness were shown to display an increased sensitivity to variations in the beam quality when compared to tpr measurements .
this effect is amplified for higher nominal energy photons .
the derivation of clinical baselines and associated tolerances has allowed this method to be incorporated into routine qa , streamlining the process whilst also increasing versatility .
in addition , the effect of beam adjustment can be observed in real time , allowing increased practicality during corrective and preventive maintenance interventions .

routine linac quality assurance ( qa ) testing is , therefore , recommended to ensure that the produced physical beam properties are maintained within specified tolerances of the baseline values assumed by the tps .
1 , 2 the beam quality , as characterized by its penetrative ability in water , is one such fundamental property .
the current standard metric for beam quality measurements is percentage depth dose ( pdd ) in water .
during a commissioning process , a high resolution pdd plot will be captured using a full water phantom. from this pdd , a tissue phantom ratio ( tpr ) value may be derived as a beam quality constancy check parameter .
this commonly adopted method is often used during routine qa due to its simplicity and practicability , with only dual - depth , isocentric , ionization chamber measurements being required .
at brighton and sussex university hospitals ( bsuh ) , routine measurements are made at 5 cm and 15 cm depth within a solid water - equivalent plastic ( wep ) phantom , and a tpr15 / 5 constancy parameter is derived from their ratio , as described in the materials & methods section a. during the production of a clinically useful x - ray photon beam , a flattening filter is typically used within the linac to produce a beam profile which is flat at a given depth in water .
due to the conical shape of the flattening filter , the energy spectrum of the beam varies across the beam profile with a unique dependence upon the individual filter .
if changes arise within the input beam energy spectrum , the interactions with this filter will also vary and modify the flatness of the profile at a given depth .
it has been shown that these changes in flatness can be used to monitor changes in beam quality with an increased sensitivity over traditional pdd techniques .
3 , 4 at bsuh , two ic profiler ( sun nuclear corporation ( snc ) , melbourne , fl ) multi - axis ion chamber array devices , ( 5 ) referred to locally as icp1 and icp2 , are currently used to monitor the symmetry of photon beams when located within a linac gantry head attachment .
if the beam quality could also be validated from the profile flatness data acquired during these measurements , the additional time and equipment required for tpr measurements could be removed , allowing the qa process to be streamlined .
in addition , the placement of the icp within the linac head attachment allows the icp surface to remain perpendicular to the central beam axis as the gantry rotates .
this , in turn , permits an assessment of the beam flatness to be made with ease at any gantry angle or during arc deliveries .
the aim of this work was therefore to establish the relationship between tpr15 / 5 values and beam flatness for the four clinical elekta linacs at bsuh. from this relationship , baseline flatness values may be derived alongside tolerances which equate to those currently implemented .
this will , in turn , allow tpr15 / 5 measurements to be replaced by flatness measurements on a routine basis , streamlining the qa process and improving versatility. ii. materials and methods measurements were made on four matched linacs : linacs 1 - 3 ( precise , elekta ltd. , crawley , uk ) and linac 4 ( synergy , elekta ltd. ) .
linacs 2 - 4 were dual - photon energy with 6 and 10 mv photon beams available , whilst linac 1 was single - photon energy with only a 6 mv photon beam available .
measurements of tpr15 / 5 were made using a 0.6 cm3 ionization chamber positioned within a wep phantom , and beam flatness was measured using one of the two available icp devices .
each icp was calibrated using the recommended wide - field calibration technique and associated software .
( 6 ) the additional steps suggested by goodall and morgan ( 7 ) were also applied to improve cross - device calibration consistency .
to capture flatness and tpr15 / 5 measurements for a range of photon beam qualities extending beyond clinically acceptable values , the bending magnet system was progressively adjusted .
the bending coarse and bending fine magnets were both altered from the clinical values , maintaining the relative ratio between them and hence the achromatic setup .
for each new set of bending magnet currents , the electron gun current servo and automatic frequency control systems were optimized so as to restore a maximum dose rate , and beam steering corrections were made to achieve optimal symmetry .
measurements were then made on each linac of tpr15 / 5 , the diagonal and the axial normalized flatness for all variations around the two nominal energies. a. tpr15 / 5 measurements of tpr15 / 5 were made based on the techniques described in the ipsm code of practice for high - energy photon therapy dosimetry .
( 8 ) the ionization chamber was placed at the isocenter , defining a constant source to chamber distance of 100 cm , during measurements at depths of 15 cm and 5 cm in wep .
readings were taken at each depth with a symmetric 10x10 cm2 field and the tpr15 / 5 was then calculated as ( 1 ) tpr15 / 5 = r15 r5 where r15 and r5 are the average ionization chamber readings at depths of 15 cm and 5 cm , respectively .
the temperature , pressure , and ion recombination corrections were assumed to be equal at both depths .
at our institution , the baseline values for tpr15 / 5 , when measured using the technique described above , are 0.703 and 0.752 for 6 and 10 mv beams , respectively .
on monthly testing of the tpr15 / 5 , a clinical tolerance of +/ - 0.5 % is applied locally to surpass the recommendations of the guidance .
1 , 2 b. beam flatness the icp was positioned with an ssd of 100 cm and a 1 cm slab of perspex was added to provide buildup in addition to the intrinsic 0.9 cm within the device .
( 5 ) the source - to - chamber distance was therefore set to 100.9 cm. all measurements were made by integrating the dose of a 30x30cm2 field over a 100 mu exposure .
two definitions of the beam flatness were investigated : the diagonal normalized flatness , fdn , as described by gao et al. , ( 3 ) and the axial normalized flatness , fan. from the captured profile the beam flatness values were calculated as ( 2 ) fdn =( sumi = 14rdi )/ 4rcax and fan =( sumi = 14rai )/ 4rcax where rdi are the corrected readings from the chambers situated on the positive and negative diagonal axes at +/ - 17.0 cm , rai are the readings from the chambers situated on the x - and y - axes at +/ - 12.0 cm , and rcax is the reading from the central beam axis ion chamber .
for all readings , the derived chamber specific calibration factors were applied and the background was accounted for. iii .
results for each linac and nominal energy value , both fdn and fan were found to vary linearly , with the tpr15 / 5 percentage error arising from an investigative range of bending magnet settings .
figure 1 shows the relationship between tpr15 / 5 percentage error and flatness for the measurements performed at 6 mv on linac 3 , extending across the clinically acceptable range of beam quality .
when varying the bending magnets settings , a greater response was displayed by the diagonal flatness data ( fdn ) for every linac and energy combination when compared to the equivalent axial flatness data ( fan ) .
for the 6 mv beams , the mean rate of change in fdn across all four linacs was calculated to be - 4.2 %+/ - 0.2 % per 1 % change in the tpr15 / 5 percentage error .
for fan , this value was calculated to be - 3.3 %+/ - 0.2 % per 1 % change in the tpr15 / 5 percentage error .
additionally for all linacs , when adjusting the bending magnet current for the 10 mv nominal energy setting , a more rapid change in flatness with tpr15 / 5 percentage error was demonstrated as compared to the 6 mv results given above .
for 10 mv , the overall mean rate of change in fdn across all four linacs was calculated to be - 6.1 %+/ - 0.2 % per 1 % change tpr15 / 5 percentage error .
figure 2 shows the individual data for linac 2 .
using icp1 , the mean baseline fdn value was calculated across all four linacs to be 103.0 % for a nominal energy of 6 mv with a range of 102.5 % to 103.8 % .
for a nominal energy of 10 mv , the mean fdn value was calculated to be 102.7 % with a range of 102.6 % to 102.8 % .
when using the icp2 device , the rates of change of fdn with tpr15 / 5 percentage error for 6 and 10 mv were found to be equal to those measured using icp1 within the experimental error of a +/ - 0.2 % variation in the rate of change of fdn with tpr15 / 5 percentage error .
small discrepancies were measured between the baseline fdn values derived for each icp which were greater than the fdn repeatability of +/ - 0.2 % .
these variations were found to have a mean magnitude of 0.5 % and a maximum magnitude of 0.8 % .

the dotted lines show the +/ - 0.5 % clinical tolerance applied locally to the tpr15 / 5 measurements. iv. discussion these results provide similar findings for elekta precise and synergy linacs to those which were shown for a varian medical systems clinac 2100 by gao et al .
( 3 ) the fdn was shown to always provide a more sensitive measure of photon beam quality than either fan or the traditional measurement of tpr15 / 5 .
as a result of this work , it has been possible to implement this measurement technique on a routine basis , and streamline the routine and corrective qa processes by maximizing the amount of information which can be captured from a single exposure .
in addition , the photon beam quality may easily be assessed with respect to clinically relevant tolerances under more varied conditions , including alternative gantry angles and during arc deliveries .
for the linacs that were investigated , it can be suggested that , when measuring at the 80 % width points for a 30x30 cm2 field , applying fdn tolerances of +/ - 2 % or +/ - 3 % , for 6 or 10 mv photons , respectively , would ensure that the tpr15 / 5 was correct within the local tolerance of +/ - 0.5 % .
it can also be estimated that , if the beam profile maintains less than a +/ - 2 % variation from the baseline value , the tpr15 / 5 will remain correct within approximately +/ - 0.25 % or +/ - 0.20 % for 6 and 10 mv photons , respectively .
a device such as the icp also allows the user to view the beam profile in a real - time mode .
when carrying out corrective action , any changes to the beam quality may therefore be immediately observed and assessed without the need to complete time - consuming ionization chamber measurements within a phantom .
although the rate of change of fdn with tpr15 / 5 percentage error was shown to be comparable between linacs , offsets were measured between the baseline values .
these differences may arise from the accuracy with which individual linacs are matched to one another and within the manufacturing process of the linac components , such as the flattening filter .
this technique must , therefore , be commissioned for each individual linac and energy combination .
variations in the baseline values were also observed between icp devices , which may be due to residual uncertainties within the calibration process , despite the additional steps to minimize these .
7 , 9 considerations should therefore be given to establishing separate baselines for each device , or to reduce tolerances , if interchangeability is desired .
using the methods described here , it is suggested that approximately 90 min would be required , per energy , to capture a sufficient quantity of tpr15 / 5 data and corresponding profiles in order to derive the required relationships for two icp devices .
once baseline and tolerance values have been established , two key points should be addressed before implementing this technique on a routine basis .
firstly , although the fdn measurement is largely unaffected by errors within the beam symmetry , ( 3 ) it is suggested that a value of tpr15 / 5 is only interpreted from the fdn value when the beam symmetry is within locally applied tolerances ; at bsuh this tolerance is +/ - 2 % , based on guidance .
1 , 2 secondly , it is important to ensure the ongoing consistency and reproducibility of the beam profiling device .
to ensure this is adequate , an assessment of the accuracy of each profiling device in use should be considered against a full water phantom on an annual basis or following a device recalibration. v. conclusions a strong linear correlation was shown between tpr15 / 5 and fan , and also between tpr15 / 5 and fdn values for 6 and 10 mv photon beams across multiple elekta linacs .
measurements of fdn were shown to have an increased sensitivity to changes in beam quality compared to fan which , in turn , was more sensitive than the current constancy check parameter of tpr15 / 5 .
the use of flatness measurements in place of tpr15 / 5 may , therefore , allow beam quality tolerances to be reduced , whilst simultaneously providing a means to more easily achieve them through direct observation of live beam profiles during corrective action .
in addition , flatness measurements have an increased versatility when compared to tpr15 / 5 determination by allowing the beam quality to be validated under varying conditions , such as alternative gantry angles .
following an initial commissioning time investment of approximately 90 min per nominal energy for two profiling devices , this technique can allow streamlining of the qa process by minimizing the number of exposures and quantity of equipment which is required .
the method also presents opportunities for maintaining an improved level of consistency in machine performance due to its enhanced sensitivity and improved practicality , as compared with traditional methods of beam quality determination .

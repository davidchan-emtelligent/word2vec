objective : to investigate the prognostic significance of cytogenetic abnormalities , staging , patient factors , and the serum p53 protein concentration in chinese non - hodgkin lymphoma ( nhl ) patients .
material and methods : the study included 43 patients with nhl that were identified between august 2003 and december 2008 .
patient clinical characteristics patients were determined based on morphological , immunohistochemical , and cytogenetic analysis , and the serum p53 protein concentration was measured quantitatively .
results : following conventional chemotherapy , the complete / partial remission ( cr / pr ) rate was significantly higher and overall survival ( os ) was significantly longer in the patients with early - stage ( stage i - ii ) lymphoma , normal karyotype , and a low serum p53 protein concentration than in those with advanced - stage ( stage iii - iv ) lymphoma , cytogenetic abnormalities , and a high serum p53 protein concentration (>= 0.35 u / ml ) .
bone marrow infiltration was also a predictor of poor response and os. there were n't any significant differences in disease remission between the male and female patients , older and younger patients ( aged < 70 years vs. >= 70 years ) , or b - cell lymphoma and t - cell lymphoma patients .
conclusion : staging is an effective means of assessing the severity of nhl .
cytogenetic examination can provide useful information for diagnosis , staging , and prognostication .
the serum p53 protein level may be a potential prognostic marker in patients with nhl .
conflict of interest : none declared .

non - hodgkin lymphoma p53 protein karyotype introduction non - hodgkin lymphoma ( nhl ) is a heterogeneous disease that is generally categorized as indolent or aggressive , based on the morphology and proliferation of cancerous cells [ 1,2 ] .
differences in clinical features and treatment responses are evaluated based on the morphological , histological , immunophenotypic , cytogenetic , genetic , and molecular features that affect and indicate the aggressiveness of the disease .
nonetheless , the critical events associated with disease progression remain poorly understood , and their prognostic relevance has yet to be fully validated .
in addition , p53 protein is known to be a tumor suppressor that maintains genomic stability - - either by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis .
although some studies have proposed that p53 protein expression is involved in lymphomagenesis , no study has analyzed the serum p53 protein level in chinese nhl patients .
as such , the present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the karyotype detected at the time of diagnosis , staging , patient factors , and the serum p53 protein concentration , according to the complete / partial remission ( cr / pr ) rate and overall survival ( os ) in a cohort of chinese nhl patients .
in addition , the potential relationships between these factors were also evaluated .
materials and methods patients of the 43 chinese nhl patients included in this study , 37 had b - cell neoplasm and 6 had t - cell neoplasm .
all the patients were admitted to our hospital between august 2003 and december 2008 .
at the time of diagnosis the median age of the 30 male and 13 female patients was 51 years ( range : 10 - 81 years ) .
nhl was diagnosed according to the world health organization ( who ) classification system , based on morphological , immunophenotypical , and clinical features [ 3 ] .
initial clinical data for all patients were recorded , including age , sex , disease classification and stage , bone marrow infiltration , karyotype , serum p53 protein concentration , mortality , and follow - up. the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee and was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
all the patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study .
enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and research into nhl blood samples were collected from each patient .
peripheral blood and / or bone marrow aspirate smears stained with wright - giemsa were analyzed and classified according to the who classification for nhl [ 3 ] .
suspensions were collected from bone marrow aspirate material and cultured in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 20 % fetal calf serum , penicillin - streptomycin , minimum essential medium vitamins , and glutamine at 37 degreesc for 24 h. cells were exposed to colcemid overnight , followed by hypotonic treatment ( kcl 0.075 m ) for 30 min , and then fixation in ethanol and acetic acid ( 3:1 ) .
chromosome analysis was based on reverse heat giemsa ( rhg ) - banded metaphases .
chromosomal abnormalities were defined according to the 2005 international system for human cytogenetic nomenclature [ 4 ] .
the immunophenotype of each patient was confirmed via paraffin section immunoperoxidase , as previously described [ 5 ] .
serum samples were collected upon admission - - prior to the administration of any treatment .
enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) for quantitative detection of human serum p53 protein was performed , according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( bender medsystems , germany ) .
stage - modified international prognostic index ( ipi ) the stage - modified ipi was designed according to the ipi for which the original ann arbor stage ii was substituted by the lugano staging system for nhl .
response criteria response to treatment was evaluated based on imaging studies .
response criteria were defined according to international working group recommendations .
cr was defined as the complete disappearance of all physical and radiological evidence of disease for >= 4 weeks .
biopsies of lymphomas were performed to confirm cr. patients without cr at the end of treatment were considered treatment failures .
os was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of the final follow - up or time of death due to any cause .
statistical analysis fisher 's exact test and logistic regression models were used to determine if any of the study parameters ( age , sex , disease classification and stage , bone marrow infiltration , karyotype , and serum p53 protein ) were independent prognostic factors of the overall response rate ( cr + pr ) .
survival data were analyzed according to the kaplan - meier method , and were compared using the log - rank test .
multivariate regression analysis using the cox proportional hazard model was used to identify risk factors on os. data were analyzed using spss v.12.0 .
a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results cytogenetic findings chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 19 patients and are summarized in table 1 .
abnormalities were taken into consideration if they were observed in a majority of abnormal cells or were known to be associated with a particular subtype of nhl .
the main abnormalities showed a degree of association with the underlying diagnosis , although a few exceptions were apparent .
the following translocations were observed : t ( 14 ; 18 )( q32 ; q2l ) in 6 of 15 patients with diffuse large b - cell lymphoma ( dlbcl ) ; t ( 14 ; 18 ) in 3 of 7 patients with follicular lymphoma ( fl ) ; ( q32 ; q21 ) t ( 11 ; 14 ) in 2 of 3 patients with mantle cell lymphoma ( mcl ) ; t ( 11 ; 18 )( q21 ; q21 ) in 2 of 5 patients with marginal zone b - cell lymphoma ( mzbl ) ; de1 ( 13 )( q14q31 ) in 1 of 6 patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma ( sll ) ; t ( 8 ; 14 )( q24 ; q32 ) in the 1 patient with burkitt 's lymphoma ( bl ) ; + 3 , + 5 , and + x in 2 of 3 patients with angioimmunoblastic lymphoma ( ail ) ; t ( 2 ; 5 ) ( p23 ; q35 ) in 1 of 2 patients with ki - l + anaplastic large - cell lymphoma ( ki - 1 alcl ) ; inv ( 14 )( q11 ; q32 ) in the 1 patient with adult t - cell lymphoma .
figure 1 shows the dlbcl karyotypes .
in this case , the histology of the lymph node predominantly showed the presence of small - cleaved cells with sparsely spaced large cells ( 14 ; 18 ) was detectable cytogenetically .
p53 expression and nhl in total , p53 protein expression < 0.35 u / ml was observed in 1 of the 6 cases ( 16.7 %) of t - cell nhl and in 14 of the 37 cases ( 37.8 %) of b - cell nhl .
according to real classification , p53 protein expression < 0.35 u / ml was observed in 6 of the 15 dlbl patients , 3 of the 6 ( 50 %) sll patients , the 1 ( 100 %) bl patient , 2 of the 6 ( 33.3 %) peripheral t - cell lymphoma ( ptcl ) patients , 1 of the 3 ( 33.3 %) mcl patients , 3 of the 7 ( 42.9 %) fl patients , and 1 of the 3 ail patients ( table 2 ) .
there was n't a correlation between p53 protein expression status , and age , sex , disease stage , t / b - cell type , or ipi score .
analysis of short - term curative effect following conventional chemotherapy , 9 patients achieved cr and 14 patients achieved pr. the overall response rate ( cr + pr ) was 53.49 % .
in all , 20 patients had disease progression during treatment .
significantly more patients with early - stage ( stage i - ii ) lymphoma , normal karyotype , and a low p53 protein level had cr / pr than did those with advanced - stage ( stage iii - iv ) lymphoma , cytogenetic abnormalities , and a high serum p53 protein level .
bone marrow infiltration was also a predictor of poor response , as indicated by fisher 's exact test , although there was n't a significant difference in the rate of disease remission between male and female patients , younger and older patients ( aged < 70 vs. >= 70 years ) , or b - cell lymphoma and t - cell lymphoma patients .
table 3 summarizes patient characteristics and fisher p values associated with the overall response rate .
advanced - stage , bone marrow infiltration , and cytogenetic abnormalities were observed to be adverse prognostic factors based on univariate analysis , but not according to multivariate analysis ; however , the serum p53 protein level was an independent prognostic factor for disease remission , based on the logistic regression model .
the most likely cause of this is the existence of multicollinear relationships ( high degree of correlation [ correlation coefficient > 0.7 ] between these independent variables ) between the 4 variables mentioned above .
as such , tumor stage , karyotype , and bone marrow infiltration might be considered prognostic factors that affect the overall response rate and the p53 protein level .
the results of multivariate analysis using the logistic regression model are summarized in table 4 .
analysis of long - term curative effect os was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the last follow - up evaluation or time of death due to any cause .
median survival time ( mst ) was 33 months .
bone marrow infiltration , cytogenetic abnormalities , and a low serum p53 protein level were all strongly associated with os ( figures 2,3,4 ) .
the log - rank p values for os are shown in table 5 .
log - rank testing showed that being female had a positive effect on prognosis ( p = 0.0107 ) .
os was significantly longer in patients with early - stage ( stage i - ii ) lymphoma than in those with advanced - stage ( stage iii - iv ) lymphoma ; however , there was n't a significant difference in os between younger (< 70 years ) and older (>= 70 years ) patients , or between patients with t - cell and b - cell lymphoma .
multivariate analysis using the cox proportional hazard regression model was performed to assess the effect of the factors mentioned above on os ( table 6 ) .
the data showed that sex and the p53 protein concentration affected os , whereas advanced - stage lymphoma , bone marrow infiltration , and cytogenetic abnormalities were not significant prognostic factors .
multicollinearity may be the most important reason , and therefore the 3 variables were still significantly associated with tumor - related os. discussion a number of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities associated with histopathological subtypes and clinical outcomes have been identified in nhl [ 6 ] .
translocation t ( 14 ; 18 ) and t ( 8 ; 14 ) are strongly associated with fl and bl , t ( 11 ; 14 ) is associated with mcl , and t ( 2 ; 5 ) is associated with anaplastic large - cell lymphoma , and 3q27 abnormalities are associated with dlbcl [ 7 ] .
some chromosomal aberrations are associated with significantly poor prognosis ; for example , rearrangement of 8q24 , + 7q , and del ( 13q ) are independently associated with significantly shorter event - free survival in dlbcl , whereas del ( 13q ) and + 7q have a similar effect in dlbcl and bl [ 8 ] .
in the present study 19 of the 43 nhl patients had cytogenetic abnormalities .
it is difficult to assess the prognostic significance of individual cytogenetic alterations in a small patient cohort with a short follow - up period ; however , the present findings strongly support the concept that chromosomal aberrations noted at the time of diagnosis are useful for predicting the overall response rate and / or os using univariate and multivariable analysis .
chromosomal abnormalities were also observed in some patients with normal morphological characteristics , suggesting that bone marrow aspirate smears from a single puncture site may be of limited value in determining if the bone marrow is involved .
chromosomal analysis could be used as a supplementary technique .
another advantage of cytogenetic analysis is its ability to detect balanced translocations that would otherwise be missed by some dnabased techniques [ 9 ] .
thus , it is necessary to perform cytogenetic examination to obtain useful information for diagnosis , staging , and prognostication .
molecular analysis of chromosome rearrangements has resulted in identification of several genes directly implicated in the biology of nhl ; however , only with cytogenetic analysis will it become possible to identify additional events that could lead to further characterization of these genetic transpositions .
studies based on chromosome painting and in situ hybridization with breakpoint - specific probes may help elucidate the nature of these complex translocations and the genes involved in the secondary events .
a sequential study may also establish the relative importance of these rearrangements to different stages of the lymphoma - leukemia development process and define the roles of the additional abnormalities described herein .
the p53 gene is a cancer suppressor gene located at chromosome 17p13.1 .
it encodes a 53 - kda nuclear phosphoprotein ( p53 protein ) .
it acts as a negative regulator of the cell cycle [ 10 ] .
it has been shown that p53 protein is activated in response to dna damage and oncogenic stress via 2 distinct signaling pathways involving kinase - mediated phosphorylation of p53 protein by atm / chk2 / 1 cascade and inhibition of mdm2 via p19arf , which results in p53 protein stabilization [ 11,12,13,14 ] .
solid tumors , including non - small - cell lung cancer , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , osteosarcoma , bladder cancer , and prostate cancer , exhibit increased apoptosis in response to advexin [ 15 ] .
because serum p53 protein can be found in a small percentage of normal controls , its presence is not considered a diagnostic marker of cancer. whether its serum concentration should be used as a screening marker or a predictive factor for the development of cancer remains to be determined .
it has been reported to be variably present in the sera of patients with various malignancies .
several investigators have reported that the mean preoperative serum concentration of p53 protein in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was significantly higher than that in healthy controls .
higher serum p53 protein levels were also observed in lung cancer , pancreatic carcinoma , and colorectal cancer patients than in normal controls [ 16,17,18,19 ] .
in the present study p53 protein was observed in the sera of nhl patients , which confirmed its value as a marker of the p53 concentration in nhl .
the present data show that over - expression of p53 protein (>= 0.35 u / ml ) was associated with a lower cr / pr rate and poor os. although the following conclusion cannot be considered definitive because of the small sample size , the findings suggest that serum p53 protein may be a potential prognostic marker for nhl .
unlike staging , sex is not a conventional means of assessing disease severity , and there is no consistent concept of its role in the prognosis of nhl .
the present data show that female gender was positively correlated with longer os than male gender , but this gender difference must be investigated further by studies with larger samples .

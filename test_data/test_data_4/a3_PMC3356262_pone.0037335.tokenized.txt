flight is one of the energetically most costly activities in the animal kingdom , suggesting that natural selection should work to optimize flight performance .
the similar size and flight speed of birds and bats may therefore suggest convergent aerodynamic performance ; alternatively , flight performance could be restricted by phylogenetic constraints .
we test which of these scenarios fit to two measures of aerodynamic flight efficiency in two passerine bird species and two new world leaf - nosed bat species .
using time - resolved particle image velocimetry measurements of the wake of the animals flying in a wind tunnel , we derived the span efficiency , a metric for the efficiency of generating lift , and the lift - to - drag ratio , a metric for mechanical energetic flight efficiency .
we show that the birds significantly outperform the bats in both metrics , which we ascribe to variation in aerodynamic function of body and wing upstroke : bird bodies generated relatively more lift than bat bodies , resulting in a more uniform spanwise lift distribution and higher span efficiency .
a likely explanation would be that the bat ears and nose leaf , associated with echolocation , disturb the flow over the body .
during the upstroke , the birds retract their wings to make them aerodynamically inactive , while the membranous bat wings generate thrust and negative lift .
despite the differences in performance , the wake morphology of both birds and bats resemble the optimal wake for their respective lift - to - drag ratio regimes .
this suggests that evolution has optimized performance relative to the respective conditions of birds and bats , but that maximum performance is possibly limited by phylogenetic constraints .
although ecological differences between birds and bats are subjected to many conspiring variables , the different aerodynamic flight efficiency for the bird and bat species studied here may help explain why birds typically fly faster , migrate more frequently and migrate longer distances than bats .
introduction the independent evolution of powered flight in birds and bats begs the question of whether the apparent convergence in size , shape and flight style has resulted in the same overall flight performance , or if they differ in any aspect .
most birds and bats operate in the same reynolds number regime ( re = uc / nu ~ 104 , where u is the flight speed , c is the wing chord length and nu is the kinematic viscosity of air ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , which indicates an overall fluid dynamic similarity [ 3 ] .
thus , any difference in flight performance would be due to variation in ecological requirements or phylogenetic constraints on morphology [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
for example , night - active bats have protruding ears required for echolocation , which affects the drag generated by the body [ 6 ] .
bats have wings formed by skin membranes stretched between elongated finger bones , while bird wing surfaces are formed of adjacent feathers radiating from reduced skeleton bones .
to date , there are a few studies that suggest possible differences in flight efficiency between birds and bats , but with conflicting results [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
thus , the available data on flight performance in birds and bats are too limited to draw any general conclusions on differences in relative flight performance as a result of differences in phylogeny .
in the present study , we studied the effect of phylogenetic origin of flight on performance by comparing the aerodynamic flight performance for two passerine bird species and two new world leaf - nosed bat species , flying across a range of flight speeds under similar conditions in a wind tunnel [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
flight performance was measured by studying the aerodynamic wake produced by the flying animals using time - resolved particle image velocimetry ( piv ) [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] .
since these types of studies are relatively time consuming and labor intensive , the number of species that can realistically be studied is limited .
therefore , it is important to select the study species as carefully as possible such that a bias due to differences in ecology is reduced .
we studied three pied flycatchers ( ficedula hypoleuca ) ( body mass 14 g ) , one blackcap ( sylvia atricapilla ) ( 16 g ) , two pallas' long - tongued bats ( glossophaga soricina ) ( 10 g ) , and two lesser long - nosed bats ( leptonycteris yerbabuenae ) ( 22 g ) , table 1 .
the flight dynamics data for each species that this study was based on are reported elsewhere [ 12 ] - [ 15 ] .
the species studied are similar in size and thus fly at similar re (~ 104 ) , which might lead to similar aerodynamic performance [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
the selected bird and bat species also partly overlap in feeding and migration behavior , which are ecological factors potentially influencing flight performance [ 2 ] ( see discussion for more detail ) .
for the species studied , we determined two independent quantitative measures of the relative flight performance : the span efficiency , a measure for the efficiency of lift production [ 13 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] and the effective lift - to - drag ratio for flapping flight , a metric associated with energetic flight efficiency [ 12 ] , [ 18 ] .
the results were compared among the species , and differences in performance between the birds and bats were related to differences in morphology , kinematics , ecology and fluid dynamics , to identify the effect of phylogenetic origin of flight on the performance of vertebrate flight .

materials and methods ethics statement the experiments were carried out in accordance with university guidelines and approved by the malmo / lund animal research ethics committee of the counties of blekinge , skane and halland ( malmo / lunds djurforsoksetiska namnden , blekinge , skane och hallands lan ) .
experimental animals three pied flycatchers , one blackcap , two pallas' long - tongued bats , and two lesser long - nosed bats were used for the experiments .
morphological data for all experimental animals are in table 1 .
experiments the experimental setup consisted of the lund university low - turbulence , low - speed wind tunnel [ 10 ] , [ 19 ] , a high - speed ( 200 hz ) stereo particle image velocimetry system ( piv ) , and two high - speed kinematics cameras running at 250 hz ( fig. s1 ) [ 11 ] .
for the nectar - feeding bats , we used a honey - water feeder to position them in the tunnel .
when a bat was flying steadily at the feeder , we sampled the wake behind the animal using the piv system .
the birds were trained to perch in the test - section of the wind tunnel .
when the perch was lowered , the bird took off .
if the bird flew steadily in the correct position , piv measurements were performed , after which the perch was presented again .
the temperature ranged between 20 - 25degreesc during experiments .
using this experimental procedure , we did experiments at a wind tunnel speed range of u = 2 - 9 m / s , in increments of 1 m / s. for the pied flycatchers , measurements were done for flycatcher # 3 at 2 , 4 , and 7 m / s and for flycatcher # 1 and # 2 at all flight speeds between u = 2 - 7 m / s. for the blackcap , measurements were done at u = 7 , 8 and 9 m / s. for the bats , piv was measured at all flight speeds from 2 m / s to 7 m / s. for each measured individual - speed combination , piv data of at least 10 wingbeats was analyzed .
piv analysis the stereo piv data was analyzed using davis ( lavision , davis 7.2.2.110 ) , resulting in three - dimensional velocity vectors { u,v,w } within each node point { y,z } in each piv frame [ 11 ] .
the piv frames within one wingbeat were given a frame number n = [ 1 - n ] ( n = 1 for the beginning of the downstroke and n = n at the end of the upstroke ) , a non - dimensional time stamp tau = [ 0 - 1 ] , and a streamwise position x = [ 0 - lambda ] ( lambda is the wingbeat wavelength ) .
the non - dimensional time stamps are defined as tau = t / pi , where pi is wingbeat period .
t is the timing within the wingbeat where t = 0 corresponds to the start of the downstroke , t = pi is at the end of the upstroke , and t = rdspi is at the end of the downstroke , where rds is the wingbeat downstroke ratio .
for the frames in between , t was linearly interpolated .
assuming that the wake convects statically downstream with the forward flight speed , the streamwise position of each piv frame is x = ( n - 1 ) udeltat , where deltat is the inverse of the piv frame rate ( 1 / 200 hz ) [ 12 ] , [ 15 ] .
the piv results were analyzed by identifying the main vortices in the wake : the tip vortex , root vortex , tail vortex and reversed vortex loops [ 14 ] , [ 20 ] .
in each piv frame , the position { x,y,z } and circulation gamma of the present vortex structures were measured using a custom - made matlab ( 7.7.0.471 , r2008b ) piv analysis program [ 12 ] , [ 15 ]. from this , the resultant normalized aerodynamic lift of each vortex structure was calculated using basic vortex theory [ 3 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] as ( 1 ) where w is the weight of the animal , rho is the air density and bw ( tau ) is the wake span determined from the y - position of the vortex structure ( fig. s2a ) [ 15 ] .
the normalized thrust component of the aerodynamic force of each vortex structure is determined by ( 2 ) where is the mean streamwise vortex system angle .
for the tip vortex system , it is determined by ( 3 ) where gammatip ( tau ) is the spanwise tip vortex angle ( fig. s2 ) [ 12 ] , [ 15 ] .
atip and abody are the vertical wingbeat amplitude of the wingtip and body , respectively , determined from kinematics measurements [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
there is a minus sign in front of abody / atip because the vertical body movement is in anti - phase with the wing movement ( body moves up when wings move down ) .
for the root vortex system , it is determined by ( 4 ) where abody / aroot is estimated abody / aroot = abody / atip.atip / aroot , and atip / aroot is determined from the relative movement of tip and root vortex .
for the reversed vortex loop and tail vortex we assume [ 12 ] , [ 15 ] .
the vertical induced velocity distribution w ( y *) along the normalized span y * was measured in each piv frame along a straight line from the position behind the animal 's body center line to the spanwise most distal vortex structure [ 13 ] .
the non - dimensional span is defined as y * = y / b , where b is the wingspan .
average wingbeats we determined the average wingbeat for a certain species - speed combination by averaging the results of all measured wingbeats for that species - speed combination , using smoothing splines .
the average wingbeat wake consists of the average temporal normalized lift and thrust of all vortex structures [ 12 ] , [ 15 ] and the average spanwise and temporal downwash distribution [ 13 ] , for each species - speed combination .
the relative variation in the spanwise downwash distribution was estimated by determining a sliding 95 % confidence interval of m local data points , with m the amount of analyzed wingbeats [ 13 ] .
aerodynamic forces and performance by integrating and throughout the wingbeat we determined the wingbeat average lift - to - weight ratio l / w , the effective lift - to - drag ratio l / d ( d = t for steady flight [ 12 ]) , and the normalized cost - of transport cot = 1 /( l / d ). by integrating and throughout the downstroke and upstroke we determined l / wdown , t / wdown , l / wup , and t / wup , respectively. from the average spanwise and temporal downwash distribution , the real induced power pi and ideal induced power pi ideal were estimated .
pi is the induced power for generating l and pi ideal is the minimum induced power required to generate l , based on the equivalent uniform spanwise downwash .
the effective span efficiency for a complete wingbeat is defined as ei = pi ideal / pi [ 13 ] , [ 17 ] .
statistical analysis to control for differences in weight between species , which is expected to affect the characteristic flight speed according to w 1 / 6 [ 18 ] , [ 25 ] , we used normalized flight speeds for the statistical analyses .
the normalized flight speed for a certain individual is defined as u * = u ( w ref / w ) 1 / 6 , where w is the weight of the individual and w ref is the average weight of the pallas' long - tongued bats [ 12 ] .
the results for the different animals were compared using mixed linear models .
l / d ; cot ; ei ; l / wdown ; t / wdown ; l / wup or t / wup was set as the dependent variable .
for all tests bird / bat ; u * ; u * xbird / bat were set as factors , while only for l / d , and cot we added ( u *) 2 ; ( u *) 2 xbird / bat as factors .
species nested within bird / bat was set as a random variable .
results the aerodynamic wakes generated by a representative wingbeat were visualized for the different species studied flying at u = 7 m / s ( fig. 1 and fig. s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 ) .
for both the birds and bats , each wing generates a wing ' tip vortex ' and a wing ' root vortex ' at the start of the downstroke .
for the birds , the root vortices disappear immediately after the start of the downstroke , while for the bats the root vortices are present throughout the complete wingbeat .
the stronger root vortices during the downstroke in the bats result in a reduction in downwash behind the body compared to the birds ( fig. 2a - b ) .
the tip vortices are present throughout the complete downstroke , but disappear during the upstroke .
for the birds , the tip vortices consistently disappear earlier within the upstroke than for the bats ( fig. s7a - b ) .
for the birds , but not the bats , a new vortex pair appears closer to the body about the same time as when the tip vortex disappears ( fig. 1 ) .
we assume that these are shed from the body / tail configuration , so they are labeled ' tail vortices' [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
the tail vortices are present until the end of the upstroke and add to lift ( fig. s7a - b ) [ 15 ] .
the bats , but not the birds , generate a vortex loop behind each wing during the latter part of the upstroke ( fig. 1 ) [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 28 ] - [ 30 ] .
these vortex loops result in a negative lift signified by an upwash at the outer wing ( fig. 2c - d , fig. s7c - d ) , and are therefore labeled ' reversed vortex loops' [ 12 ] .
thus , the bats generate a more complex wake , including stronger root vortices and reversed vortex loops , than the birds [ 20 ] .
for more details on the wake structure we refer to previous studies of the wake dynamics for these species [ 12 ] - [ 15 ] , [ 20 ] .

the dotted lines show the average downwash for all measurements and the bars around the dotted lines are the sliding 95 % confidence interval .
the wingbeat average lift - to - weight ratio across the measured flight speed range was l / w = 0.99 +/ - 0.03 ( mean +/ - standard deviation ) for the pallas' long - tongued bat ; l / w = 0.95 +/ - 0.04 for the lesser long - nosed bat ; l / w = 0.93 +/ - 0.10 for the pied flycatcher ; and l / w = 1.14 +/ - 0.11 for the blackcap .
the two independent aerodynamic performance metrics , the lift - to - drag ratio l / d and span efficiency ei were significantly higher for the birds compared to the bats , throughout the complete measured flight speed range ( p = 0.0088 and p < 0.0001 , respectively , table 2 ; fig. 3a - b ) .

to test how the difference in l / d for the bats and the birds affects the flight dynamics , we consider the normalized lift and thrust production during the downstroke and upstroke separately ( l / wdown , t / wdown , l / wup and t / wup , respectively ; fig. s8 ) .
note that , for steady flight , the mean thrust throughout the wingbeat is equal to the mean total drag d [ 12 ] .
during the downstroke , both lift and thrust production increased with flight speed ( fig. s8a - b ) , similarly for the birds and bats ( p = 0.9954 and p = 0.1266 for l / wdown and t / wdown , respectively ; table s1 ) .
during the upstroke , however , the lift and thrust production scale very differently with flight speed in the birds and bats ( p = 0.0002 and p < 0.0001 for l / wup and t / wup , respectively ; table s2 and fig. s8c - d ) .
l / wup decreases with flight speed for the bats , while it increases for the birds , and t / wup is close to zero for the birds , while it varies significantly with flight speed for the bats .
the normalized mechanical cost - of - transport cot is a non - dimensional variable that represents the amount of mechanical energy required to transport a unit weight across a unit distance ( cot = e /( wd ) , where e is energy required and d is distance ) [ 18 ] , [ 31 ] .
for flying animals , the cost - of - transport can be estimated by cot = 1 /( l / d ) .
the cot distribution across flight speeds shows the familiar u - shaped curve for both the birds and the bats ( fig. 3c ) , but the values for the bats are significantly higher than for the birds ( p = 0.0248 , table 2 ) .
we estimated migratory flight performance based on the average cot distributions for bird and bat , by assuming equal energy available for mechanical work in the birds and bats .
we analyzed two scenarios : ( 1 ) if a bird and bat fly at the same flight speed of u * = 6 m / s , the bird can fly 28 % further than an equally sized bat ( dbird = 1.4 dbat , fig. 3c ) .
( 2 ) if the migration distance is the same for a bird and a bat and the bat operates at minimum cot ( cot = 0.15 at u * = 4.0 m / s , fig. 3c ) , the bird can fly 41 % faster than the bat ( u * = 6.7 m / s for the bird , fig. 3c ) .
discussion the energetic cost of flight is directly related to the amount of drag produced by a flying animal [ 1 ] .
this drag can be divided into drag produced by the wing ( profile drag ) , drag produced by the body ( parasite drag ) , and drag resulting from the downwash generated behind the animal ( induced drag ) .
the span efficiency ei is related to the induced drag , since it is a measure of the deviation from a constant spanwise downwash distribution associated with an elliptic lift distribution , which results in minimum induced drag ( ei = 1 ) [ 13 ] , [ 17 ] .
our bats deviated more from a constant spanwise downwash distribution than our birds ( fig. 2 ) , mainly due to reduced downwash behind the body ( fig. 2a - c ) , which is a result of lower body lift in the bats [ 13 ] .
thus , since our bats generate less body lift than our birds , their span efficiency is lower ( fig. 3a ) and consequently also l / d is lower [ 3 ] , [ 17 ] .
the fact that the bats generate less body lift could be a result of having less streamlined bodies than the birds , e.g. due to the presence of the protruding nose leaf and ears required for echolocation [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 32 ] .
the protruding ears can be expected to also increase the parasite drag , as was found in a model of a brown long - eared bat ( plecotus auritus ) [ 6 ] , and since concave shapes such as these ears are known to be the most drag producing bluff bodies [ 33 ] .
the differences in wake dynamics between the birds and bats during the upstroke are mainly a result of the presence of reversed vortex loops in the bats and tail vortices in the birds ( fig. 1 ) .
the reversed vortex loops in the bats are generated by moving the wing upwards at a negative angle - of - attack resulting in production of positive thrust and negative lift [ 12 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 28 ]. with increasing flight speed this negative lift and positive thrust also increase ( fig. s8c - d ) [ 12 ] .
the birds , on the other hand , make their wings inactive ( feathered ) during the latter part of the upstroke by retracting them and by spreading the primary wing feathers [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
therefore the birds primarily generate body lift during the latter part of the upstroke , resulting in tail vortices ( fig. s8c - d ) [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 26 ] .
hence , there is a clear qualitative and quantitative difference in the function of the upstroke between the passerine birds and the leaf - nosed bats studied here , which could be directly related to the difference in l / d. hall and colleagues [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] modeled flight efficiency in large - amplitude flapping wing configurations relevant for flapping flight of birds and bats .
they found that for flapping wings with relatively low l / d ( l / d = 5 , i.e. similar to that of the bats ) , the energetically optimal flapping kinematics generate thrust in combination with negative lift during the upstroke ( i.e. resulting in reversed vortex loops ) [ 36 ] .
achieving this wake thus require wing kinematics to have negative angles - of - attack of the outer wing during the upstroke .
for configurations with higher l / d ( l / d = 10 , i.e. similar to that of the birds ) the upstroke should optimally generate positive lift [ 36 ] .
so , both the birds and bats have wake topologies that are near the optima for the respective l / d regime they operate at [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
the lift - to - weight ratios determined from the vortex wake dynamics are close to one , and hence we can assume that the majority of the wake dynamics forces are captured ( fig. s5 ) , resulting in a realistic estimate of l / d and cot .
the fact that l / w for the blackcap was on average higher than one , can be explained by the fact that the blackcap sporadically bounded during the experiments ( as they also naturally do ) , particularly at the highest measured flight speed .
to compensate for the low lift produced during these bounds the bird enhanced its lift during the flapping phases , resulting in l / w > 1 [ 26 ] , [ 38 ] .
although the analysis of the results can be considered solid , we caution against over - generalizing the results considering the small number of species in this study ( total of eight individuals from four species ) .
however , previous studies have also hinted at similar differences in aerodynamic performance between birds and bats [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , while results based on physiological measurements are less conclusive [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
the generality of our results are further supported by results from the larger dog - faced fruit bat cynopterus brachyotis ( megachiroptera ) [ 29 ] and the insectivorous tadarida brasiliensis ( microchiroptera ) [ 30 ] , which have different flight ecology than the bats used here .
the latter species has relatively high aspect ratio wings and feeds on insects in the open airspace .
despite the difference in flight ecology and morphology they have wake patterns strikingly similar to that of our leaf - nosed bats , including the main characteristics responsible for the lower performance of our bats , i.e. the reversed vortex loops during the upstroke and root vortices throughout the wingbeat as a result of relatively low body lift [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
additionally , to the best of our knowledge , all kinematics studies of flying bats to date [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 39 ] - [ 43 ] have found the upstroke wing movement responsible for generating the negative lift ( i.e. negative angle - of - attack at the hand wing section ) that produces reversed vortex loops [ 20 ] .
the upstroke wake topology for our passerine birds , consisting of primarily tail vortices , is likewise similar to the upstroke wake found in other birds , including non - passerines ( for the longitudinal piv measurements , spanwise circulation during the upstroke was maximum behind the body suggesting minimum influence of root vortices ) [ 22 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
taken together , these studies suggest that the results presented here are representative for at least new world leaf - nosed bats and passerine birds , and that further testing if the results hold for birds and bats in general should be fruitful .
there is a possibility that other factors than phylogenetic origin could explain the results found here , such as the fact that bats flew behind a feeder , which induces station - holding flight , while the flying birds were only restrained within the test section .
however , station - holding flight was also observed in the slow - flying flycatcher .
in addition , as mentioned above , the wake structures found in the bats ( strong root vortices and reversed vortex loops at the end of the upstroke ) have also been found in other species of bats not flying behind a feeder [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
the wingbeat kinematics differs between birds and bats , which may introduce a bias in the results .
however , we argue that the differences in kinematics are directly related to the differences in morphology between our birds and bats rather than being independent characteristics .
if , for example , the negative angle - of - attack at the hand wing section found in bats was undesired ( since it results in negative lift ) the bats could hold their wings at zero angle - of - attack and avoid generating the vortex .
however , if , as we argue , generating the vortices is improving performance when l / d is relatively low ( due to higher induced and parasite drag ) [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , the kinematic differences between birds and bats are a direct result of the differences in morphology .
separating the effect of kinematics and morphology is thus difficult since it is the combination of the two that generate the resulting aerodynamics .
to further explore the separate effect of kinematics and morphology we suggest studying flight dynamics in mechanical flappers where the kinematics can be altered independent of morphology [ 46 ] .
another important question is how much of the variation in flight performance between the birds and bats that was found here is due to differences in ecology .
the two ecological factors that are expected to influence flight performance most directly are movement and feeding ecology. with respect to feeding ecology , both bat species are nectarivorous glossophaginae bats that hover in front of flowers when feeding [ 32 ] , [ 47 ] .
the pied flycatcher is an insectivorous passerine that catches insects mostly during short flights involving slow flight and hovering , but also gleans from leaves and twigs [ 48 ] .
the blackcap primarily finds its food without flying at all , by gleaning insects and berries from leaves and twigs among shrubs [ 48 ] .
thus , the foraging niches of the pied flycatcher and the bats are partly overlapping , although the bats fly continuously during foraging while the birds do not .
this might result in a slight bias towards higher flight efficiency in the bats compared to the birds , especially at low flight speeds [ 9 ] .
as this was not supported by our data ( fig. 3 ) , we conclude that feeding ecology cannot explain the difference in flight performance found between our birds and bats. with respect to movement ecology , the pallas' long - tongued bat is a residential species with a relatively small home range [ 47 ] , while the lesser long - nosed bat is migratory [ 49 ] .
in fact , its migratory route is among the longest found in bats and it is therefore regarded as a long - distance migratory bat species [ 49 ] .
additionally , the lesser long - nosed bat commutes every night up to 100 km from its roost site to different feeding patches [ 50 ] .
the pied flycatcher is a long - distance migratory bird , with its breeding range throughout europe and wintering grounds in western and central africa [ 48 ] .
the blackcap is a partially migratory european passerine , where some individuals migrate and others do not .
among the migrating individuals , some stay within europe , while others migrate annually to africa and back [ 48 ] .
thus , based on the movement ecology of our birds and bats we may expect a slight bias towards higher flight performance in the birds at high flight speeds .
should this bias be the primary factor for explaining the differences in aerodynamic efficiency between our bats and birds in general , then the wake dynamics and the resulting aerodynamic performance should be more similar among migrants ( both birds and bats ) than between migrants and non - migrants .
this was not supported by our data , as the two studied bat species , although being positioned at least close to the two extremes in the movement ecology landscape for bats ( residential species versus a long - distant migrant ) , have much more similar wake patterns ( fig. 1 - 2 ) and maximum flight performance ( fig. 3 ) than compared to those of the birds .
note that there are significant differences in flight performance between our two bat species that can be related to movement ecology , as the migratory lesser long - nosed bat flies most efficiently ( highest l / d ) at a significantly higher speed than the non - migratory pallas' long - tongued bat [ 12 ] , but the maximum performance values ( l / d ) are very similar between the two species ( fig. 3 , table 2 ) , for details see [ 12 ] .
thus , the variations in aerodynamic flight performance due to differences in movement ecology , although significant for the bats , are much smaller than the variations found between our birds and bats .
therefore , we conclude that movement ecology is not the main explanatory variable for the difference between our birds and bats .
this is further supported by the fact that , as discussed above , kinematics and wake dynamics are more similar among all currently studied birds and bats than between birds and bats [ 12 ] - [ 15 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 22 ] - [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] - [ 30 ] , [ 39 ] - [ 45 ] , independent of movement ecology .
taken together , this suggests that our birds and bats may not be able to reach the same level of performance primarily due to phylogenetic constraints [ 4 ] .
however , to test this hypothesis more thoroughly , we suggest future studies to estimate the aerodynamic flight performance of additional bird and bat species that span larger ecological and morphological ranges , and for additional flight modes such as in gliding and maneuvering flight .
due to the higher flight efficiency in our birds compared to our bats , the birds have a lower mechanical cost - of - transport cot ( fig. 3c ) .
the flight speed at which cot is minimum for the bats ( u * = 4.0 m / s ) is similar to the average natural flight speed of lesser long - nosed bats when commuting over land ( u * = 3.7 m / s for u = 4.3 m / s ) [ 50 ] , suggesting that the estimated cot curves are relevant for predicting optimal flight speeds .
however , the difference in mechanical cot does not need to be followed by a similar difference in the actual energetic cot .
there is a possibility that the higher mechanical cot in bats could be compensated for by higher energy conversion efficiency in the bats [ 7 ] , as suggested by the similar power consumption in birds and bats [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
the independent evolution of flight in birds and bats has resulted in two different wing designs .
in this study we show that the feathered avian wing is made inactive during the upstroke and body lift is produced , while the membranous bat wing generates significant flight forces during the upstroke .
both sets of wingbeat kinematics are close to optimal for the relative flight performance regime [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , suggesting that evolution has optimized performance relative to the respective conditions of birds and bats , but that maximum performance is limited by phylogenetic constraints on wing and body morphology [ 4 ] .
although optimal migration strategies depend on many conspiring variables [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , the differences in flight performance between the birds and bats found here may help explain why bats typically fly slower , migrate less frequently and shorter distances than birds [ 32 ] , [ 52 ] - [ 55 ] .

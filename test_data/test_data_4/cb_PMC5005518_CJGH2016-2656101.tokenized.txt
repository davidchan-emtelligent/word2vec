background and aims .
we initiated peroral endoscopic myotomy ( poem ) utilizing a two - person technique with combination of an advanced endoscopist and a thoracic surgeon with complementary skills .
our aim was to determine the feasibility and outcomes in initial 20 patients. methods .
in this observational study , main outcomes measured were therapeutic success in relieving symptoms ( eckardt score < 3 ) , decrease in lower esophageal sphincter ( les ) pressures , improvement in emptying on timed barium esophagogram ( tbe ) , and complications. results .
poem was successful in all 20 patients with a mean operative time of 140.1 + 32.9 minutes .
eckardt symptom scores decreased significantly at two - month follow - up ( 6.4 + 2.9 versus 0.25 + 0.45 , p < 0.001 ) .
both basal and residual les pressures decreased significantly ( 28.2 + 14.1 mmhg versus 12.8 + 6.3 and 22.4 + 11.3 versus 6.3 + 3.4 mmhg , p = 0.025 and < 0.001 , resp. ) .
barium column height at 5 minutes on tbe reduced from 6.8 + 4.9 cm to 2.3 + 2.9 cm ( p = 0.05 ) .
two patients ( 10 %) had mucosal perforations and one had delayed bleeding ( 5 %). conclusions .
two - person technique of poem with combination of an advanced endoscopist and a thoracic surgeon is highly successful with low risk of complications .
1. introduction achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by esophageal aperistalsis and incomplete lower esophageal sphincter ( les ) relaxation during swallowing .
classical symptoms include dysphagia , regurgitation , chest pain , and weight loss .
goal of current treatment modalities of achalasia is to decrease the lower esophageal sphincter pressure , thereby relieving the symptoms .
standard treatments include pneumatic dilation , heller myotomy , and botulinum toxin injection into les [ 1 ] .
pneumatic dilation and heller myotomy have comparable midterm efficacy , and botulinum toxin injection provides only temporary relief [ 1 , 2 ] .
peroral endoscopic myotomy ( poem ) is the new kid on the block and is evolving as a very promising treatment modality for achalasia .
poem is a novel , incisionless treatment modality that combines the efficacy of a surgical myotomy with the convenience of an endoscopic procedure .
the concept of poem is derived from natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( notes ) and advances in endoscopic submucosal dissection ( esd ) techniques .
feasibility of endoscopic esophageal myotomy in an animal model was initially described by pasricha et al. and it was refined and translated into clinical practice by inoue et al .
[ 3 , 4 ] .
performing a poem requires technical skills that encompass both endoscopy and surgery .
it requires advanced endoscopic skills similar to esd , surgical skills including thorough knowledge of surgical anatomy of esophageal and mediastinal structures , and the ability to manage adverse events [ 5 ] .
hence , we started poem program at our institution in 2014 , utilizing a two - person technique with combination of an advanced gastrointestinal endoscopist and a thoracic surgeon with complementary skill sets .
our multidisciplinary approach encompasses standardized protocol , including careful patient selection after thorough diagnostic evaluation , standardized poem technique , immediate post - poem care , and subsequent follow - up care .
poem is rapidly gaining popularity and is being performed at increasing number of tertiary centers around the world [ 6 ] .
currently , most of the reported outcomes of poem for achalasia are from those performed by either foregut surgeons , thoracic surgeons with endoscopic training , or gastroenterologists with training in poem and / or esd [ 6 ] .
there are reports of two operators performing the procedure together ; however , both of the operators are usually from the same specialty [ 7 , 8 ] .
aim of this study was to report the short - term outcomes from our initial 20 consecutive achalasia patients who underwent poem by our two - person technique with combination of an advanced gastrointestinal endoscopist and a thoracic surgeon .
2. methods data on initial 20 consecutive patients who underwent poem for achalasia by our two - person technique at our institution from april to october 2014 were collected .
patients were identified from our institutional review board approved prospective poem registry .
patient demographics , clinical history , preoperative and procedural data , complications , and follow - up data were collected from our secure redcap database .
2.1 .
our standard poem protocol 2.1.1 .
procedure training and credentialing poem operators at our institution ( ms , sr , and sm ) received adequate training and practice of poem in ex vivo porcine model , attended live poem courses , and observed poem procedures performed by experienced operators before starting human cases .
ms has also visited japan for 2 weeks and obtained training in esd and poem by observership before starting poem at our institution .
each of our poem operators performed at least 15 poem procedures in ex vivo porcine esophageal model before performing human cases .
credentialing process at out institution involved at least two proctored cases initially by an experienced poem operator before performing the poem independently .
hence , our first two cases were proctored by an external experienced operator .
2.1.2 .
initial evaluation and patient selection all patients were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team comprising gastroenterologists with expertise in esophageal diseases , thoracic surgeons , and radiologists .
patients had a standard diagnostic work - up prior to poem including an upper endoscopy , tbe , hrem , and eckardt symptom scoring and staging of achalasia .
achalasia was staged according to the eckardt score as stage 0 ( score 0 - 1 ) , stage 1 ( score 2 - 3 ) , stage 2 ( score 4 - 6 ) , and stage 3 ( score > 6 ) [ 9 ] .
initially the following subsets of patients were considered for poem : ( a ) patients in whom laparoscopic heller myotomy is technically difficult or less desirable such as obese patients , patients with multiple upper abdominal surgical scars , that is , hostile abdomen , and those with prior failed heller myotomy and ( b ) patients over 60 years of age ( not younger patients since long - term cumulative effects of gerd after poem are not yet known ) .
selected patients underwent poem based on the consensus reached at the multidisciplinary meeting and after discussion with the patient about the alternatives such as heller myotomy and pneumatic dilation .
2.1.3 .
pre - poem preparation all patients were instructed to be on clear liquid diet for 3 days prior to procedure .
nystatin oral suspension ( 100,000 units / ml ) was prescribed for 3 days prior to procedure at a dose of 2 ml every 6 hours to swish and swallow orally .
they were given half a gallon of golytely ( peg - electrolytes ) oral solution for bowel cleansing on the night before the procedure similar to those undergoing heller myotomy at our institution .
patients fasted past midnight on the day prior to the procedure .
all patients received antibiotic prophylaxis with 1500 mg of intravenous cefuroxime and 200 mg of intravenous fluconazole 30 minutes prior to poem .
2.1.4 .
poem procedure all procedures were performed in an operative room under general anesthesia by standard technique similar to that described by inoue et al .
[ 4 ] .
carbon dioxide insufflation was used instead of room air with a carbon dioxide insufflator ( ucr , olympus co. , tokyo , japan ) .
all procedures were performed with a high - definition endoscope ( gif h - 190 , olympus co. , tokyo , japan ) .
after insertion of an endoscope , esophageal mucosa on the anterior wall ( posterior wall in patients with prior hellers myotomy ) , 10 - 14 cm proximal to gastroesophageal junction ( gej ) , was lifted with submucosal injection of 10 ml of indigo carmine stained normal saline .
a 2 cm longitudinal mucosotomy incision was performed with a triangle - tip knife ( tt - knife , olympus co. , tokyo , japan ) with the endocut current , setting 2 - 1 - 3 ( vio300d , erbe , elektromedizin gmbh , tubingen , germany ) .
then , submucosal tunnel was created using spray coagulation ( effect 2 , 50 watts ) and extended 2 - 4 cm onto the gastric side .
selective myotomy of inner circular muscle fibers ( at times resulting in complete myotomy including longitudinal fibers ) was performed using spray coagulation starting 5 - 8 cm proximal to gej and extending 2 - 4 cm onto the gastric wall .
any large bleeding vessels were coagulated using coagrasper forceps ( fd 410 - lr , olympus co. , tokyo , japan ) .
before the end of the procedure , 40 mg of gentamycin mixed with 20 ml of normal saline was sprayed into the submucosal tunnel .
finally , the mucosotomy was closed with endoscopic clips ( instinct clips , cook endoscopy , winston - salem , nc , usa ) .
during the procedure , if there was significant capnoperitoneum as evidenced by increase either in plateau pressure on mechanical ventilator or on subjective palpation of abdomen , an 18 - gauge angiocath needle ( or veress needle ) was placed in the right subcostal area to decompress the peritoneum .
during our lab experience / practice we found that having a second operator holding and stabilizing the endoscope shaft while the primary operator was controlling the dials and devices was very helpful .
hence , we adopted the two - person poem technique .
in our two - person technique , both the advanced endoscopist and the thoracic surgeon performed the procedure together with each one performing certain portions of the procedure alternatively .
the primary operator worked with the endoscope dials and catheters / devices .
the second operator held and stabilized the endoscope shaft while applying constant tension at the submucosa - muscularis propria interface for faster and safer dissection .
mucosotomy , submucosal tunneling , and endoscopic clipping were mostly performed by the advanced endoscopist .
thoracic surgeon mostly performed myotomy and ensured adequacy of myotomy in terms of both completeness and appropriate length onto the gastric side .
however , these steps were interchangeable and arbitrary between the two operators in different procedures .
operative time was measured from initial insertion of endoscope until the end of the procedure .
2.1.5 .
perioperative care all patients were kept nil per os ( npo ) and were observed overnight in the hospital on intravenous fluids , intravenous proton pump inhibitor , and an intravenous antibiotic , cefuroxime .
a gastrografin swallow study was performed next day and patients were started on clear liquid diet if the swallow study did not show a leak and were discharged home .
the diet was gradually advanced over next several days .
a proton pump inhibitor was prescribed to all patients for at least 2 months .
2.1.6 .
follow - up care a follow - up was arranged in 1 - 2 weeks to evaluate for any adverse events .
then another follow - up visit was arranged at about 2 months after procedure .
at that time , evaluations included eckardt symptom scoring , timed barium esophagogram ( tbe ) , 24 - hour esophageal ph study of medications , and a high - resolution esophageal manometry ( hrem ) study .
patients with either gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) symptoms or abnormal 24 - hour ph study were continued on ppi therapy indefinitely .
a 24 - hour ph study was considered abnormal if esophageal acid exposure was greater than 4.5 % of the total time .
an eckardt symptom score of <= 3 was considered as therapeutic success or remission .
2.1.7 .
statistical analysis data are presented as mean +/ - standard deviation , median [ p25 , p75 ] , or n (%) .
a subgroup analysis was performed in subjects who had 2 - month postprocedure follow - up. differences between pre - and postprocedure were assessed with one - sample t - test or the nonparametric wilcoxon signed rank test for continuous factors and test of symmetry for categorical factors .
a p <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
all analyses were performed using sas ( version 9.4 , the sas institute , cary , nc ) .
3. results the mean age of this patient cohort was 56.7 years (+/ - 18.1 ) .
the male to female ratio was 14 to 6 .
most of the patients were caucasian ( 17 / 20 , 85 %) and the mean bmi was 28.6 (+/ - 5.9 ) .
asa class was ii in 7 patients , iii in 11 patients , and iv in 2 patients , respectively .
preprocedural characteristics including achalasia types , findings on hrem , tbe , eckardt symptom scores and stage , and details of prior treatments received for achalasia are shown in table 1 .
only 30 % of the patients were treatment naive and the rest received either one or multiple standard treatments of achalasia prior to poem .
more than 50 % of patients had advanced stage 3 achalasia .
one patient ( 5 %) had sigmoid esophagus .
poem procedural data are summarized in table 2 .
poem was successfully performed in all 20 patients ( 100 %) .
mean operative time was 140.1 +/ - 32.9 minutes .
five patients ( 25 %) needed veress needle placement to decompress capnoperitoneum .
six patients ( 30 %) with history of prior heller myotomy had mucosotomy and submucosal tunnel created on the posterior esophageal wall while the rest of the 14 patients ( 70 %) had standard anterior wall procedure .
two patients with prior heller myotomy had inadvertent mucosal perforations near the gej .
one of them could be closed with one endoscopic clip and the other one was larger than 1 cm and was not amenable to clipping .
both of these patients were kept npo for two days after poem ( instead of our standard 1 day ) and then had a barium swallow study which was negative for a leak .
they were started on clear liquids and were discharged home .
median length of hospital stay of our patients after poem was 1 day ( 1.00 and 2.5 ) and return to activities of daily living ( adl ) was 5 days ( 5.0 and 7.0 ) .
one patient ( one of the two patients with a large mucosal perforation at gej during poem ) required hospitalization on 19th postoperative day , due to melena with a 4 gram drop in hemoglobin level .
he was noncompliant with the prescribed proton pump inhibitor .
an upper endoscopy performed showed a 1 cm clean based ulcer at the gej , most likely source of bleeding .
he did not require any blood transfusion and was discharged home within 2 days .
comparative data between pre - and post - poem at two - month follow - up are summarized in table 3 .
all 12 patients with a two - month follow - up had remission of symptoms with reduction in eckardt score to 0.25 +/ - 0.45 post - poem versus 6.4 +/ - 2.9 pre - poem .
there was significant improvement in hrem parameters including resting les pressure ( 12.8 +/ - 6.3 versus 28.2 +/ - 14.1 mmhg ) and integrated residual les pressure ( irp ) ( 6.3 +/ - 3.4 versus 22.4 +/ - 11.3 mmhg ) .
most of the parameters at both one minute and 5 minutes improved significantly in tbe as well .
gerd symptoms were reported by 4 out of 11 patients ( 36.4 %) .
twenty - four - hour esophageal ph study was abnormal with increased acid exposure in 5 out of 10 patients ( 50 %) .
4. discussion our study showed that performance of poem with two - person technique by an advanced endoscopist and a thoracic surgeon was highly successful with excellent short - term outcomes in our initial 20 patients .
this was despite our patients being more complex compared to other reported early series , with majority of them with advanced achalasia and failure of other standard treatment modalities .
this study 's findings are similar to previous reported studies in terms of short - term outcomes including treatment success and low risk of complications [ 8 , 10 - 12 ] .
most of our patients had significant improvement in symptoms reflected by significant reductions in eckardt scores .
there was also physiological improvement in esophageal function as evidenced by decreased les pressures on follow - up hrem and improved esophageal emptying on tbe .
gerd symptoms were reported by 36 % of patients and this is similar to other published studies from the western world [ 8 , 11 , 12 ] .
two patients ( 10 %) with prior heller myotomy had mucosal perforations near gej on the gastric side during poem .
inadvertent mucosal perforations are known to occur and our incidence is similar to other reported studies [ 8 ] .
one patient had delayed bleeding , most likely from a gej ulcer .
noncompliance with proton pump inhibitor might have contributed to this complication .
gej ulcers were reported in about 20 % of patients after poem probably related to thermal injury during poem or due to ischemia [ 8 ] .
our study patients were more complex compared to other reported early series .
only 30 % of our patients were treatment naive and the rest of the patients have failed other treatment modalities of achalasia .
some of them have received multiple treatments prior to poem .
since poem is a complex procedure requiring high technical skills and a long learning curve , many experts recommend beginners to perform treatment naive cases for up to 20 procedures before taking on complex cases [ 13 , 14 ] .
however , this was not feasible as most of the achalasia patients referred to us have failed prior treatments .
despite this , we were able to perform poem successfully in these complex patients using our meticulous combined approach. from our study experience , we recommend that complex poem cases should be performed only in tertiary care centers with availability of expertise to handle untoward complications .
although poem can be performed by a single operator , we believe our two - person technique has several inherent advantages .
the main advantage is the constant tension applied to the submucosa - muscularis propria interface by the second operator in the two - person technique , which is not easily accomplished by the single operator technique .
this facilitates safer and faster dissection with more control .
additionally , in complex poem procedures such as those performed after numerous endoscopic interventions or after failed heller myotomy , the added experience of two physicians over that of the single operator has value in appropriately identifying planes when they are not very clear .
this is especially important in the early experience of operators in this relatively new technique .
having a second operator might also help in reducing operator fatigue and ensuring that each step is done thoroughly .
if two - person technique is not feasible and poem is to be performed by a gastroenterologist , we suggest having a thoracic or foregut surgery backup available as needed .
some of our study limitations include small sample size and short follow - up. we do not know if these outcomes persist in the long run .
however , it should be noted that poem was successfully performed in advanced achalasia patients that have failed other conventional treatment modalities including heller myotomy .
treatment options for such patients are limited and include morbid redo heller myotomy or esophagectomy .
poem is an excellent minimally invasive rescue option for them .
another limitation of our two - person technique is the need to coordinate the schedules of the two operators to perform the procedure .
at our institution , both operators bill the procedure as cosurgeons and share the revenue .
we plan to continue this approach at our institution due to the complimentary skill sets of the operators and excellent outcomes .
however , this approach might be very useful for initiating a poem program until the operators get through the initial learning curve of 20 cases or so. this study is from a tertiary care referral center in which two experienced operators performed all the procedures , hence these findings may not be generalizable to general community practices .
however , since achalasia is a rare condition , we do not foresee community practitioners performing this procedure .
in conclusion , our findings suggest that two - person technique of poem by an advanced gastrointestinal endoscopist and a thoracic surgeon is highly successful with excellent short - term outcomes .
although poem is a low risk procedure , serious complications such as severe bleeding , mediastinitis , and potential damage to surrounding vital structures can occur [ 15 ] .
poem is still an evolving treatment for achalasia with unknown long - term side effects , especially from gerd such as possible barrett 's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma .
these possibilities should be discussed with patients before considering poem .

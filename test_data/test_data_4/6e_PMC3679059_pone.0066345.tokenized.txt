the clavata ( clv ) signaling pathway is essential for shoot meristem homeostasis in arabidopsis .
clv acts to limit the expression domain of the stem cell - promoting gene wuschel ( wus ) .
the closely related receptor - kinases clv1 and bam1 are key components in this pathway ; however , the downstream factors that link the receptors to wus regulation are poorly understood .
the arabidopsis gene at5g65480 was recently identified as a direct transcriptional target up - regulated by wus .
we have independently identified this gene which we term cci1 as a clv1 and bam1 interacting protein in vitro and in transient expression .
cci1 has phosphatidylinositide - binding activity in vitro and localizes to the plasma membrane in transient expression .
furthermore , clv signaling components and cci1 both partition to detergent - resistant membrane microdomains characterized as lipid rafts .

introduction the aerial organs of the adult plant body are reiteratively initiated from a tightly maintained population of stem cells found at the shoot and flower meristems .
each meristem maintains a small number of stem cells in the center , surrounded by the more rapidly dividing and differentiating daughter cells [ 1 ] .
the shoot meristems maintain a strict balance between proliferation and differentiation of stem cells throughout the life of the plant .
the shoot meristem ( sm ) in arabidopsis is composed of three stem cell layers ( l1 , l2 , and l3 ) .
directly beneath l3 stem cells is the organizing center ( oc ) defined by the expression of the transcription factor wuschel ( wus ) [ 2 ] current evidence indicates that wus protein moves from the oc to the overlying stem cell layers to maintain stem cell identity [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
the components of the clavata signaling transduction pathway act to spatially restrict wus expression .
the clv pathway components include the clv3 ligand , the leucine - rich repeat ( lrr ) receptor - kinase clv1 , the lrr receptor protein clv2 , and crn , a transmembrane kinase - related protein .
mutations in the clv components result in expanded wus expression and enlarged meristem [ 5 ] .
in addition , the clv1 - related bam1 , bam2 and bam3 proteins fulfill both redundant and unique roles .
in the meristem center , the weakly expressed bam proteins act redundantly with clv1 to limit meristem size .
however , bam1 and bam2 are predominantly expressed in the meristem periphery [ 6 ] .
loss of bam receptors results in a reduction in stem cell accumulation [ 7 ] .
in addition to their complex roles in meristem development , bam receptors are expressed throughout the plant , and bam1 bam2 double mutants exhibit pleiotropic developmental defects ranging from seedling lethality , to reduced vascular branching to male sterility [ 6 ] , [ 8 ] .
critically , clv1 and bam receptors can cross - complement each other , indicating that the biochemical function of the individual receptors is largely interchangeable .
several receptor complexes have been identified by various studies using both transient expression and in vivo analysis .
the most commonly detected complexes are clv1 and clv1 / bam multimers and a complex of clv2 and crn [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] .
higher ordered interactions between clv1 and clv2 complexes have only been detected in transient expression .
the ligand , clv3 , is proteolytically processed to release the cle peptide , which can then bind the extracellular domain of all of the detected receptor complexes [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
clv1 , bam1 , bam2 and clv2 all have nearly identical binding affinities to the mature clv3 ligand in vitro [ 11 ] .
there is a conspicuous lack of understanding of signaling intermediates between the known clv components and wus .
the only known verified signaling intermediates are the phosphatases pol and pll1 .
identified in a suppressor screen of the clv mutant phenotype , pol pll1 double mutants lack all stem cells and aerial tissues phenocopy wus mutants [ 13 ] - [ 16 ] .
pol and pll1 act downstream of clv1 to maintain wus expression .
pol / pll1 are plasma membrane localized in a fashion dependent on n - terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation [ 17 ] .
this localization is required for protein function as the mutant phenotype can only be complemented by expression constructs with both of these acylation sites intact .
in addition , pol and pll1 are phospholipid binding proteins whose phosphatase activity is stimulated by pi ( 4 ) p. in this study , we describe a novel protein cci1 identified through interaction screens with both clv1 and bam1 .
we present evidence of cci1 receptor interactions when transiently overexpressed in tobacco , plasma membrane localization , phospholipid binding , and membrane microdomain partitioning .
results identification of a novel clv1 - interacting protein we performed a protein interaction screen using the yeast cytotrap system that involves interactions at the yeast plasma membrane ( supporting figure 1 ) [ 18 ] .
yeast at the restrictive temperature require that hsos ( a ras gef ) localize to the plasma membrane to replace the temperature sensitive cdc25 isoform .
hsos was fused to the clv1 and bam1 kinase domain and placed into yeast along with cdna library from arabidopsis meristem tissue placed behind a n - terminal myristoylation tag to drive plasma membrane localization .
only those yeast with a cdna - encoded protein that bound to clv1 or bam1 would localize the hsos tag to the plasma membrane and survive at the restrictive temperature .
the kinase domains used in this screen corresponded to residues 697 - 980 for clv1 and 699 - 1003 for bam1 .
each bait was screened separately .
because clv1 and bam1can replace each other 's function in arabidopsis [ 6 ] , we hypothesized that proteins interacting with both kinase domains were more likely to represent physiologically relevant partners .
we sequenced 32 putative positive lines from yeast with the clv1 bait protein and 52 lines from yeast with the bam1 bait ( supporting tables 1 and 2 ) .
among these positives , two were identified from both clv1 and bam1 screens and only one , at5g65480 , was identified multiple times in both screens .
all positives for at5g65480 were full - length cdnas , suggesting that interaction with clv1 and bam1 required the full - length protein .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0066345.g001 figure 1 alignment of cci1 - related proteins from land plants .
an alignment of arabidopsis thaliana cci1 , cci2 and related proteins from various plant species is shown .
conserved residues are shaded at 75 % .
basic - rich regions are underlined .
the top and bottom segments of cci1 sequence correspond to the n and c - terminal half constructs used in the lipid - binding assays .
at5g65480 , which we have named cci1 ( inspired from clavata complex interactor ) encodes a small protein of 153 amino acids .
while having no known motifs , the genomes of all land plants we analyzed contained homologues of cci1 ( figure 1 ) .
arabidopsis contains a second related protein encoded by at4g38060 which we named cci2 ( figure 1 ) .
expression profile mapping of the sm identified cci1 as differentially up - regulated in cells of the central zone of the meristem , suggesting an overlap with clv1 expression and function [ 19 ] .
very recently , a screen for direct transcriptional targets of wus identified at5g65480 as one of the genes most highly induced by wus activation .
[ 20 ] .
we first tested whether cci1 directly interacts with the clv1 kinase domain by expressing the corresponding proteins in e. coli as epitope - tagged fusion proteins .
in pull - down experiments , gst - cci1 showed direct interaction with the clv1 kinase domain , but not in control reactions ( figure 2a ) .
cci2 also showed direct interaction with clv1 ( figure 2a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0066345.g002 figure 2 cci1 interactions with clv signaling components in vitro and in transient expression. a. purified clv1kd - gfp , gst , gst - cci1 and gst - cci2 proteins were mixed in various combinations , immunoprecipitated ( ipd ) with anti - gst antibodies , and the resulting immunoprecipitates were assayed on a protein gel blot probed with anti - gfp .
the first lane shows clv1kd - gfp input. b. total membrane extracts from n. benthamiana leaves expressing cci1 - flag and full - length clv1 - gfp and bam1 - gfp ipd with anti - gfp antibodies and co - ip detected with anti - flag antibodies .
lanes 1 , 2 and lanes 4 , 5 are replicates .
note , clv1 - gfp did not express detectably in the lane 4 replicate , nor was there co - ip detected .
experiments represented by lanes 1 - 3 used an aliquot from the lane 7 expression of cci1 - flag alone (*) .
co - ip was detected when both cci1 and bam1 were co - expressed in the same leaf ( cci1 co ) , but not when mixed post expression ( cci1 post ). c. total membrane extracts from n. benthamiana leaves expressing cci1 - flag and full - length bri1 - gfp , bam2 - gfp , clv2 - gfp and crn - gfp ipd with anti - gfp antibodies and co - ip detected with anti - flag antibodies .
experiments represented by lanes 1 - 4 used an aliquot from the lane 9 expression of cci1 - flag alone (*) .
coip was detected when cci1 and the receptors were co - expressed in the same leaf ( cci1 co ) , but not when mixed post expression ( cci1 post ) .
we next sought to determine whether the clv1 - cci1 and bam - cci1 interactions could be replicated in a plant system .
because efforts to detect epitope - tagged cci1 expressed in transgenic arabidopsis were unsuccessful , we used transient expression in n. benthamiana to express the proteins [ 21 ] .
we have successfully used this system to characterize clv1 interactions both with clv3 and with other signaling components [ 11 ] , [ 22 ] .
to test the interactions between cci1 and bam1 / clv1 , the full - length proteins were expressed as epitope tagged fusions under the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s cis elements .
two days after infiltration , leaf proteins were extracted and co - immunoprecipitation experiments were performed .
when cci1 - flag and bam1 - gfp or cci1 - flag and clv1 - gfp were co - expressed in the same leaves we detected robust co - immunoprecipitation , suggesting a protein - protein interaction between cci1 - flag and the gfp - tagged full - length receptors ( figure 2b ) .
in addition to gfp - tagged bam1 and clv1 , gfp - tagged full - length crn , clv2 and bri1 were also tested for interaction with cci1 - flag .
unexpectedly , we observed co - immunoprecipitation between cci1 - flag and all of the tested proteins ( figure 2c ) .
co - immunoprecipitations were also detected when the epitope tags were switched ( i.e. , cci1 - gfp with bam1 - flag and clv1 - flag ) ( supporting figure 2 ) .
additional control reactions demonstrated that proteins interactions were not a result of non - specific antibody interactions ( figure 2c ) .
hypothesizing that these associations might be formed spuriously after membrane isolation , we next tested whether the associations of cci1 with clv signaling components required co - expression , or could occur by mixing membrane extracts expressing the corresponding proteins .
these experiments revealed that co - expression is necessary for any interaction to occur , indicating that the cci1 - receptor interactions were not formed through spurious post - isolation interactions , but instead required that the proteins were expressed simultaneously in the same cells ( figure 2c ) .
cci1 is plasma - membrane localized and binds phosphatidylinositols in vitro because cci1 interacts with clv1 , which acts at the plasma membrane [ 23 ] , we next tested whether cci1 co - localized to the same subcellular compartment .
cci1 has no identifiable localization motif , nor any predicted transmembrane domain .
both cci1 - gfp and cci1 - flag were transiently expressed and localization was determined both by confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation .
the localization of cci1 - gfp was consistent with that of plasma membrane localization , with signal exclusively at the cell periphery ( figure 3a ) .
however , the cytoplasm of these cells is largely appressed to the cell periphery , so that we could not exclude partitioning between the membrane and the cytoplasm .
to resolve this issue , we fractionated extracts , separating membrane and soluble fractions .
for cci1 - flag , we detected localization exclusively in the membrane fractions ( figure 4a ) .
in addition , when these n. benthamiana leaf protein extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation and fractionation by two - phase partitioning , cci1 - flag was detected in the plasma membrane - enriched peg phase , and was absent from the plasma membrane - depleted dextran phase [ 24 ] , ( figure 3b ) .
this localization of cci1 is consistent with the plasma membrane - localized h + - atpase pma2 , used as a control .
these data collectively indicate cci1 is plasma membrane bound .

endoplasmic reticulum marker bip2 and plasma membrane marker pma2 are used to mark the lower and upper phases , respectively .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0066345.g004 figure 4 clv pathway components partition to drm / raft fractions. a. partitioning of cci1 - flag protein transiently expressed in n. benthamiana leaves into soluble membrane and drm fractions. b. partitioning of bam1 - flag , bam2 - flag and clv2 - myc proteins in stable arabidopsis transgenic lines into soluble membrane and drm fractions is shown. c. sucrose gradient sedimentation of solubilized membrane extracts of clatharin ( as a control ) , clv2 - myc and crn - gfp from stable transgenic arabidopsis meristem tissue .
lipid - associated proteins will float to the lighter fractions. d. co - ip of transiently expressed bam2 - gfp and cci1 - flag was detected in both total membrane fraction (+) and membrane fraction after drm depletion ( - ) .
co - ip of transiently expressed crn - gfp and cci1 - flag depended on the presence of drms .
these results raised the question of what motif ( s ) within cci1 were driving exclusive plasma - membrane localization .
as mentioned , neither cci1 nor any analyzed homologue contains a known membrane - localization motif .
furthermore , cci1 membrane localization was independent of clv1 co - expression .
one possibility emerged from attempts to use cci1 as a bait protein in the cytotrap yeast system .
here we observed that cci1 alone localized to the yeast plasma membrane ( as evidenced by auto - activation , data not shown ) .
as shown previously for the animal protein tubby , cytotrap auto - activation can result from lipid binding activity of the bait protein [ 25 ] .
furthermore , the clv1 downstream signaling phosphatases pol and pll1 autoactivate in the cytotrap system , localize to the plasma membrane , and bind to phospholipids [ 17 ] .
to test whether cci1 has lipid - binding activity , e.coli expressed gst - cci1 was incubated with lipid strips blotted with phosphatidylinositides and other lipids .
the human fapp protein , which has been shown to specifically bind phosphatidylinositol - 4 phosphate ( pi ( 4 ) p ) , was used as a positive control [ 26 ] .
full - length cci1 bound pi - monophospates and cardolipin , with weak association observed to some pi - di - and tri - phosphates ( figure 5 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0066345.g005 figure 5 the n - terminal portion of cci1 binds phospholipids .
echelon membrane lipid strips and pip strips probed with purified n - terminal gst tagged proteins at a concentration of 1 nm. the ph domain of the human fapp protein which specifically binds pi ( 4 ) p was used as a positive control .
the gst tag alone was used as a negative control .
n - terminal cci1 corresponds to the first 83 amino acids of the protein and c - terminal cci1 corresponds to the remaining 70 ( see figure 1 ) .
examination of the protein revealed the n - terminal half contains several polybasic stretches of amino acids , conserved across most plant species , while the c - terminal domain has more extensive conservation across land plants ( figure 1 ) .
several phosphatidylinositol - binding domains utilize polybasic patches to interact with negatively charged phosphates on the inositol head group of pi - mono and di - phosphates [ 27 ] .
when the n - and c - terminal regions were expressed separately as fusion proteins , the n - terminal 83 amino acids of cci1 were sufficient to bind a similar profile of lipids , while the c - terminal 70 amino acids showed no detectable binding ( figure 5 ) .
deletion constructs targeting individual polybasic regions in the n - terminal portion appeared to attenuate but not abolish lipid binding activity ( supporting figure 3 ) .
plasma membranes are not homogeneous with respect to protein and lipid - type distribution [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
isolation and visualization of membrane raft microdomains have suggested that specific protein and lipid enrichments in microdomains in the plasma membrane act as hubs to recruit signal transduction pathway components .
some microdomains are sufficiently enriched in sterols , phosphatidylinositols and saturated lipids that they become insoluble to specific detergent treatments [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
relative to the total plasma membrane , detergent - resistant membranes ( drms ) are enriched in phosphatydylinositides , such as pi ( 4 ) p and pi ( 4,5 ) p2 , over structural phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine [ 32 ] .
furthermore , we have previously observed that clv3 binding to the clv1 , bam and clv2 receptors could only be detected for receptors in drm fractions , potentially reflecting lipid raft localization [ 11 ] .
taken together , we hypothesized cci1 lipid binding might be associated with membrane microdomain partitioning of as part of signaling complexes .
cci1 was found in both the soluble membrane and detergent - resistant membrane fractions from n. benthamiana transient expression ( figure 4a ) .
clv2 partitions in a similar pattern in arabidopsis , while bam1 and bam2 are found predominantly in the soluble membrane fraction with detectable partitioning to the drm fraction ( figure 4b ) .
to test if these receptors were truly localized to lipid rafts , we assayed their sedimentation in sucrose gradients .
while the control clatharin was found exclusively in denser soluble membrane fractions , a portion of clv2 and all detectable crn from arabidopsis meristems were found in lighter fractions consistent with lipid raft partitioning ( figure 4c ) .
the potato sucrose transporter stsut1 partitions to a drm fraction of the membrane .
immunoprecipitation of stsut1 from potato tissue co - immunoprecipitated over 40 associated proteins [ 33 ] .
this broad array of interactions is thought to result from co - localization to the drm fraction .
in other words , immunoprecipitating a raft - localized protein can pull down the membrane microdomain and all of their associated proteins .
similarly , the co - immunoprecipitation of cci1 with clv signaling components could result from their co - localization to drms and not necessarily from direct protein - protein interactions .
to test this hypothesis , co - ip experiments were performed on both total membrane and drm - depleted soluble membrane fractions from n. benthamiana co - expressing cci1 - flag and crn - gfp , as well as cci1 - flag and bam2 - gfp .
when the drm fraction was removed from the membrane fraction , the cci1 / bam2 interaction was still detectable while the cci1 / crn interaction was not ( figure 4d ) .
this suggests the interaction between cci1 and crn depends on co - localization to the drm and does not necessarily reflect a direct protein - protein interaction .
genetics analysis of cci1 function we have characterized all three available alleles for at5g65480 .
cci1 - 1 is a jic sm line ( gt _ 5 _ 40258 ) , which contains an enhancer / suppressor - mutator mobile element inserted into at5g65480 [ 34 ] .
the insertion in cci1 - 1 is located 33bp after the start atg ; however , rt - pcr analysis readily detected transcripts from the downstream portion of the gene ( supporting figure 4 ) .
sequencing the insertion junction revealed that the insertion created an in - frame methionine , leading to a potentially functional protein that was transcribed ( supporting figure 5 ) .
thus , we conclude that cci1 - 1 is not a null allele and may not be hypomorphic .
cci1 - 1 plants lacked any identifiable mutant phenotype .
cci1 - 2 ( gabi _ 541d11 ) is a gabi - kat line inserted near the end of the first exon , interrupting the 124th codon , leaving intact the phospholipid binding domain and the conserved domain in the c - terminal portion [ 35 ] .
thus , it is not possible to conclude that cci1 - 2 is a null allele because the bulk of the coding sequence is left intact .
cci1 - 2 homozygous mutant plants had no identifiable phenotype .
cci1 - 3 ( gabi _ 102g06 ) is also a gabi - kat line inserted into the intron between the first and second exons .
homozygous cci1 - 3 plants could not be identified in segregating populations from heterozygous parent plants .
sequencing the right border of the t - dna insertion indicated centromeric satellite sequences , suggesting a possible chromosomal aberration .
analysis of progeny of cci1 - 3 heterozygotes indicated a 1:1 ratio of wild - type to heterozygous plants ( 32:30 ) , consistent with lethality due to chromosomal abnormalities .
to test this hypothesis , reciprocal crosses were performed between wild - type and cci1 - 3 heterozygous plants .
among the f1 progeny , we observed transmission of the cci1 - 3 allele through both the male and female gametes .
thus , the failure to observe cci1 - 3 homozygous progeny is readily explained by the chromosomal rearrangement associated with the t - dna insertion , although we cannot rule out the possibility that the cci1 - 3 homozygous plants are unviable due to the loss of cci1 function .
cci1 - 1 was also combined with a t - dna allele of cci2 ( salk _ 088916 ) from abrc .
the double mutant had no identifiable mutant phenotype .
in addition , cci1 - 1 was also combined with clv1 - 11 , clv2 - 1 and clv3 - 1 .
none of the double mutants had an apparent modified meristem phenotype as a result of the cci1 - 1 allele ( supporting figure 6 ). whether the lack of interactions reflect the nature of the cci1 - 1 allele or the function of the cci1 gene is unclear .
discussion we have identified cci1 , a novel clv1 and bam1 interacting partner .
in this study , cci1 localized to membranes apparently as a result of phospholipid binding activity .
cci1 partitioned to the plasma membrane , where a significant portion was detected in detergent - resistant microdomains .
consistent with this , clv signaling components also partitioned to lipid rafts in arabidopsis .
cci1 not only co - immunoprecipitated with clv1 and bam1 when transiently overexpressed in tobacco , but also with other clv pathway components in a manner dependent on co - localization to the drm suggesting a role for cci1 in signaling complexes located in membrane microdomains .
cci1 is the first protein identified to interact with both the clv1 and bam1 kinase domains .
cci1 is a protein with no identifiable domains or motifs .
because prediction programs do not identify any transmembrane domains or lipid modification sites within cci1 , it is likely that the phospholipid binding activity of cci1 is responsible for its localization .
other studies have shown polybasic regions are sufficient for pip binding and plasma membrane localization [ 27 ] .
for example , the c2 domain binds to pips by forming a positively charged pocket that interacts with the negatively charged inositiol head group [ 36 ] .
interestingly , cci1 has a very similar in vitro binding profile as the c2 domain of yeast rsp5p , which is sufficient to drive membrane association [ 37 ] .
the cci1 n - terminal pip - binding domain contains several such basic - rich regions .
although deletion constructs were unable to abolish phospholipid binding activity , it is possible that the multiple , positively charged basic rich regions contribute to electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged phosphate groups .
because pi ( 4 ) p is the only phosphatidylinositol isomer cci1 binds that is found at significant concentration at the plasma membrane , this is likely to be the pip cci1 is binding in vivo .
pi ( 4 ) p is the most abundant phosphatidylinositol monosphosphate found in plants [ 38 ] .
pi ( 4 ) p is important for pi ( 4,5 ) p2 synthesis , serving as the substrate for pi ( 4 ) p 5 - kinase .
the pol / pll1 phosphatases , which act as clv signaling intermediates , are also plasma - membrane localized and bind pi ( 4 ) p , suggesting an important regulatory role for this phospholipid .
the drm partitioning of cci1 could be driven by its pi - binding activity and / or protein interactions .
drms are enriched in sphingolipids , sterols , gpi - anchored proteins and glycerophospholipids , including pips , compared to the plasma membrane as a whole [ 39 ] .
drms isolated from nicotiana tabacum plasma membrane are enriched for pips when compared to total plasma membrane fractions [ 32 ] .
although pi ( 4 ) p is found in both plasma membrane and golgi pools , cci1 is only detectable in the plasma membrane fraction .
in addition , cci1 is found in both the soluble membrane and the detergent - resistant membrane fractions .
this suggests that cci1 has specificity determinates beyond simply pi ( 4 ) p. in addition , cci1 may traffic between microdomains of the plasma membrane .
cells use these raft microdomains in pathogen response , protein trafficking and they are the site of signaling hubs in the plasma membrane .
lipid rafts can both concentrate signaling components while at the same time insulating the raft members from negative signaling regulators such as phosphatases [ 28 ] .
signal transduction pathways utilizing membrane rafts have been well - characterized in animal immune response and g - protein signaling [ 28 ] , [ 40 ] .
membrane rafts in plants are enriched in proteins associated with signaling including lrr receptor kinases [ 41 ] .
auxin signaling and redox systems in membrane rafts in plants have also been characterized [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
we have presented evidence supporting drm partitioning and possible lipid raft association for several clv pathway components , including cci1 .
in addition , cle binding to clv2 , bam and clv1 can only be detected in drm fractions , suggesting clv signaling depends on receptor localization to membrane microdomains [ 11 ] .
the expression profiling data compiled by yadav et al. and the direct interaction of cci1 with the partially raft - associated kinases clv1 and bam1 combined with the co - immunoprecipitation of cci1 with drm - associated proteins when transiently overexpressed in tobacco suggest a role for cci1 in lipid - raft based signal transduction in the shoot meristem .
while we provide evidence of the biochemical properties of cci1 in transient expression , the physiological role of cci1 in the arabidopsis meristem remains an open question .
this is in part due to the lack of a clear cci1 null allele as well as the lack of phenotypes in the homozygous alleles that can be identified .
independent evidence , however , suggest a role for cci1 in meristem function .
first , cci1 is preferentially expressed within the central zone of the meristem , overlapping clv1 expression .
second , cci1 was recently identified as one of the most highly induced gene by wus activation and identified as a direct wus target [ 20 ] .
interestingly , wus also represses clv1 transcription [ 44 ] suggesting that there may be several layers to the feedback regulation in the clv / wus pathway , including a potential role for cci1 .
methods lipid binding sequences encoding cci1 , cci2 and the last 70 amino acids of cci1 ( c - term cci1 ) were amplified from cdna and inserted into pgex5x - 1 with bamhi and noti sites .
the sequence encoding the first 83 amino acids of cci1 ( n - term cci1 ) was inserted using bamhi and sali sites .

co - immunoprecipitation and fractionation of transiently expressed and arabidopsis proteins binary vectors containing 35s : bri1 , clv1 , bam1 , bam2 , clv2 , crn c - terminal gfp and clv1 and bam1 c - terminal fusion constructs , as well as bam1 - flag , bam2 - flag and clv2 - myc have been previously described [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 45 ] .
cci1 - gfp was generated by replacement of the clv1 coding sequence in the 35s : clv1 - gfp construct .
to generate the 35s : flag - cci1 cassette , the cci1 coding sequence was amplified and cloned into pentr / d - topo to create entry vectors for subcloning into pearleygate 202 via lr clonase reaction .
for transient expression , binary vector constructs were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain gv3101 and infiltrated along with p19 , a viral silencing suppressor [ 21 ] , into nicotiana benthamiana leaves .
after 48 hours , proteins were extracted in buffer ( 50 mm tris - hcl , 150 mm nacl , 10 mm edta , 10 % glycerol , 10 mm naf , 10 mm navo3 , 2 % plant specific protease inhibitor cocktail ( sigma ) , 10 ug / ml chymostatin and 2 ug / ml aprotinin ) .
for stable expression lines , 8 - 10 arabidopsis meristems were used for protein extraction .
extracts were centrifuged twice at 5,000 g for 10 minutes at 4degreesc to remove flocculate .
supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 hour at 4degreesc to separate soluble microsomal fractions .
the microsomal fractions were then solubilized using 1 % triton x - 100 with gentle agitation at 4degreesc .

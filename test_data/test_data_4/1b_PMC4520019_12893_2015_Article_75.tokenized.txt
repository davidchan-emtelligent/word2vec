background in plastic surgery , skin damage induced by ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) is a multifactorial process that often occurs .
methane gas has been reported to be a new therapeutic gas for attenuating i / r injury .
in this study , we assessed the effects of methane - rich saline ( mrs ) in regulating apoptosis on skin flap i / r injury .
methods male sprague - dawley rats , 6 - 8 weeks old , were divided randomly into three groups : one sham surgery group ( sh ) and two surgery groups .
after undergoing 6 h of i / r management of an abdominal skin flap , surgery groups were treated with physiological saline ( i / r - p ) or methane - rich saline ( i / r - m ) .
on the 3rd postoperative day , a laser doppler flowmeter was used to measure flap blood supply , and hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) staining was used to observe morphological changes .
tdt - mediated dutp - x nick end labeling ( tunel ) staining was also used to observe early apoptosis and is presented as the percentage of tunel - positive cells .
moreover , pask - 1 , pjnk , bcl - 2 and bax were detected by immunohistochemical technology .
caspase - 3 activity was also measured to evaluate the effects of mrs .
results compared to the i / r - p group , the flaps in the i / r - m group presented a larger survival area and better blood perfusion with less inflammatory infiltration and cell apoptosis , a higher expression of bcl - 2 , a lower expression of pask - 1 , pjnk and bax , and a lower caspase - 3 activity .
conclusion according to the results , mrs attenuated i / r injury by regulating apoptosis and has the potential to be applied as a new therapy for improving skin flap survival .
keywords methane - rich saline ischemia / reperfusion injury skin flaps apoptosis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background skin flap transfer is a basic plastic surgery method used for wound repair and reconstruction .
alhough surgical principles and technologies have improved significantly , flap loss caused by i / r injury after transplantation is still a serious problem to be solved [ 1 ] .
during i / r injury , many cytological and morphological changes like infiltration of neutrophils happen , among which apoptosis is one of the worst outcome .
the infiltration of neutrophils brings more free radicals and exacerbates the flap injury [ 2 ] .
however , burns believes that i / r injury is due to cell apoptosis [ 3 ] .
particular proteins , signal pathways and enzymes are involved leading to cell apoptosis , among which bcl - 2 / bax [ 4 ] , ask - 1 / jnk [ 5 ] pathway and caspase - 3 [ 6 ] are common factors .
methane is a chemical compound that is commonly used as a type of attractive fuel .
in recent years , many researchers have focused on the biological characteristics of methane , showing that methane can slow intestinal transit , augment small intestinal contractile activity [ 7 ] and increase the contraction amplitude of the guinea pig ileum , although the bioactivity of methane is not a newly discovered phenomenon in medicine [ 8 ] .
moreover , davide roccarina also noted the role of methane in intestinal diseases .
according to roccarina 's study , it is possible to detect intestinal methane with no specific clinical relevance among 1 / 3 of healthy adult individuals .
he also demonstrated that gas metabolism disorders and abnormal methane production are considered factors in many intestinal diseases , including colon carcinoma , diverticulosis , inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome [ 9 ] .
in a study from 2012 , boros showed the protective effect of methane on oxidative stress and the inflammation of intestinal injury caused by ischemia and reperfusion [ 10 ] .
alhough methane has been studied in many medicinal fields , no studies have examined the protective effect of methane on skin flap injury .
the flammability and explosiveness of methane gas limits its clinical use , but methane can be dissolve in physiological saline at the proper concentration without any changes to its chemical qualities .
based on all of these theories , this study aimed to test whether methane - rich saline could have any protective effect on the attenuation of i / r injury to decrease apoptosis level and improve skin flap survival in rats .
methods animals and grouping this animal experiment was approved by the experimentation ethics committee on animal rights protection of peking union medical college hospital .
all procedures strictly followed the national institutes of health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals .
before and after surgery , 18 male sprague - dawley ( sd ) rats , 6 - 8 weeks old and weighing 280 - 320 g , were raised in comfortable cages at 22 - 25 degreesc with adequate food and drink .
before the operation , 18 qualified laboratory rats were randomly divided into 3 groups : a sham surgery group ( sh ) ; a 6 - h ischemia group followed by physiological saline management ( i / r - p ) ; and a 6 - h ischemia group followed by methane - rich saline ( mrs ) management ( i / r - m ) .
surgical procedure this surgical procedure was modified based on the method reported by kuntscher [ 11 ] with some modifications [ 12 , 13 ] .
laboratory rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 40 mg / kg pentobarbital .
we designed and marked a rectangular 6 cm x 9 cm flap area on the abdomen and elevated it along a marked line based on the right superficial epigastric artery , and the left superficial epigastric artery was ligated .
flap ischemia of 6 h was induced in the i / r - p and i / r - m groups by clamping the right superficial epigastric artery with a microvascular clamp .
the sh group was free from ischemia induction , but the left superficial epigastric artery was still ligated .
a silicone sheet of 0.3 mm thickness was then placed between the flap and the recipient bed to prevent revascularization .
reperfusion was initiated by removing the clamp and was confirmed by the return of pulsation to the vascular arcade .
mrs production methane ( beiyang special gas research institute company , beijing ) was dissolved in 20 ml of physiological saline for 20 min at a speed of 0.2 l / min to reach a supersaturated level [ 12 ] .
mrs was freshly prepared every time to ensure that the proper concentration was reached .
intrapaeritoneal injection , instead of oral way or being exposed in methane directly , was applied to make sure each animal received equal mrs or physiological saline amount in surgery groups .
fifteen minutes before and after the reperfusion was initiated , rats in the surgery groups were injected intraperitoneally with 5 ml / kg physiological saline or mrs .
after that , the injection was performed once every 12 h until sacrifice .
evaluation of skin flap perfusion flap perfusion after the management above was measured on the 3rd postoperative day using a laser doppler flowmeter ( ldf , perimed ab , stockholm , sweden ) and laser speckle contrast analysis ( lsca , perimed ab , stockholm , sweden ) .
at an environmental temperature of 22 - 25 degreesc , the laboratory rats were anesthetized and secured on the operating table to expose the entire flap , including a part of the normal abdominal skin .
then , capillary blood flow in the dermis layer of the rats was measured by ldf .
perfusion in the necrotic and surviving abdominal flap areas was obtained automatically by delineating the specific area in the image with lsca .
h & e staining the laboratory rats were sacrificed by high - dose pentobarbital in the 72nd hour after reperfusion .
pieces of abdominal skin flap 1 x 1 cm2 in area were removed from the proximal side of the vascular axis ( fig. 1a ) for h & e staining , an apoptosis assay , immunohistochemical studies and a caspase - 3 activity assay .
the same sampling position could avoid bias caused by different sampling position .
for h & e staining , the specimens were fixed with formalin buffer .
after the tissues were paraffin - embedded , sectioned , and mounted on a slide , the tissue slides were stained with h & e for histological examination. fig. 1 the condition of the abdominal skin flaps 72 h after i / r. the red frame represents the sampling position .
the white arrow point to black zones represents the lowest blood perfusion .
the red arrow point to red , yellow and the adjacent blue areas represent surviving areas with rich blood perfusion .
( a ) representative photographs of abdominal skin flap microcirculation in the three groups are shown .
( b ) the survival rate of the total flap area .
flap survival rates were markedly higher in the i / r - m group .
( c ) the average blood perfusion of total skin flaps .
the average blood perfusion of the total flap was greater in the i / r - m group than in the i / r - p group .
the values are the means +/ - sem ; ( n = 6 for each group ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 versus the sh group ; # p < 0.05 versus i / r - p group ) apoptosis assay programmed cell death was assessed with the in situ cell death detection kit ( pod .
roche , basel , switzerland ) which catalytically incorporates fluorescent dutp at 3 ' - oh dna ends using a recombinant enzyme and terminal deoxynucleotidyl ( tdt ) transferase .
the prepared paraffin - embedded sections were dewaxed and rehydrated and , then , incubated with proteinase k ( 20 mug / ml in 10 mm tris / hcl , ph7.4 ) for 15 min at 37 degreesc .
after these slides were rinsed with pbs ( 3 min , three times ) , they were incubated in tdt - mediated dutp - x nick end labeling ( tunel ) reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 degreesc .
the samples were cleared and 50 mul of converter - pod was added for 30 min at 37 degreesc .
after rinsing with pbs ( 3 min , three times ) , sections were developed in the dark with 100 mul dab reaction mixture ( 5 mul 20 x dab , 1 mul 30 % h2o2 , 94 mul pbs ) for 10 min at room temperature .
negative ( by omitting tdt ) and positive ( by pretreating the sections with dnase i for 15 min at 37 degreesc ) controls were used for contrast .
for quantitative analysis , tunel - positive cells in three different slides from different skin tissues were randomly examined using a defined rectangular field area under 40x magnification .
cells were then counted under 400x magnification .
the data are presented as the percentage of tunel - positive cells in the total number of cell nuclei per field .
immunohistochemical studies paraffin - embedded sections were routinely dewaxed and rehydrated and then incubated for 10 min with 3 % h2o2 to block endogenous catalase .
antigen retrieval was performed by heating the unstained slides in citrate buffer to 95 degreesc for 15 min .
incubation with normal goat serum at 37 degreesc for 30 min blocked nonspecific staining .
sections were placed in a humidified chamber at 37 degreesc for 2 h with anti - bcl - 2 , anti - bax or anti - pjnk , and anti - pask - 1 antibody ( santa cruz biotechnology , dallas , texas , usa ) at a 1:50 dilution .
horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( zsgb - bio , beijing , china ) was used to mark the primary antibody .
then , the samples were flushed with pbs , stained with dab and afterwards counterstained with hematoxylin .
a brown color implied the presence of antibody bound to antigen and was detected by light microscopy with a computer - controlled digital camera and imaging software .
caspase - 3 activity assay caspase - 3 activity was detected using a fluorometric assay kit ( bivision research products , mountainview , ca , usa ) .
in brief , 50 mg of tissue was homogenized in 2x reaction buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 degreesc with caspase - 3 substrate ( devd - apc )( 1 mm ) .
substrate cleavage was measured with aspectrofluorometer at 400 nm. statistical analysis in this study , all data are reported as the mean +/ - standard error of the mean ( sem ) .
significant differences were determined via one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
all analyses were conducted using spss 17.0 .
results flap survival necrotic flap tissues were inelastic and brown , grey or black in color on the 3rd postoperative day .
in contrast , the surviving tissues were pink and elastic ( fig. 1a ) .
statistical results are shown in fig. 1b .
the total flap area considered to have survived was 22.59 +/ - 6.94 % in the i / r - p group , whereas 36.66 +/ - 10.90 % of the area was found to be living in the i / r - m group and 73.12 +/ - 6.41 % in the sham group .
in the i / r - m group , the skin flaps did not present petechiae or full - thickness necrosis like the flaps in the i / r - p group did .
flap perfusion on the 3rd day after surgery , the average blood perfusion in the ir - p group was 26.25 +/ - 6.18 pu ( ml . 100 g - 1 . min - 1 ) .
the average blood perfusion was 49.44 +/ - 9.21 pu in the i / r - m group and 85.15 +/ - 10.51 pu in the sham group ( fig. 1c ) .
the difference in average blood perfusion was obvious between the two groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
the blood perfusion results support the vitality of the flaps with the mrs treatment .
histological analysis h & e stained tissue slices were used to assess ischemic injury ( fig. 2a ) .
h & e staining marks inflammatory cells to reflect infiltration .
inflammatory infiltration could be observed among the surgical groups , but more inflammatory cells were found in the dermal and subcutaneous layer of the skin tissue slices from the i / r - p group .
according to the results above , mrs decreased inflammatory infiltration , showing that mrs was able to attenuate the inflammatory response induced by i / r injury. fig. 2 the results of h & e and tunel staining and the apoptosis index 72 h after i / r .
( a ) the morphological observation of flap tissue by h & e - staining in all groups .
the number of infiltrated cells ( red arrow ) was much lower in the i / r - m group than in the i / r - p group ; ( big images : 200x , small image : 400x ) .
( b ) the evaluation of apoptotic cell death by tunel staining in all groups .
compared to i / r - p , mrs treatment remarkably decreased tunel - positive cells in the i / r - m group ( brown staining indicates apoptotic cells ( red arrow ) ; big images : 200x , small image : 400x ) .
( c ) the apoptosis index of all groups .
the data are the percentage of tunel - positive cells and the total cell nuclei per field , and three different slide fields from different skin tissues were counted .
values are the means +/ - sem ; ( n = 6 for each group ; ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 versus the sh group ; # p < 0.05 ) detection of positive apoptotic cells tunel - positive cells were mainly stained brown as shown in fig. 2b .
few apoptotic cells ( 5.08 +/ - 1.90 %) were observed in the sham group .
compared to the i / r - p group ( 45.83 +/ - 5.61 %) , the mrs management of skin flaps clearly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells ( 34.47 +/ - 4.46 %) ( fig. 2c ) .
bcl - 2 , bax , pask - 1 and pjnk immunohistochemical studies immunohistochemical studies reflect the expression of target proteins , such as bcl - 2 , bax , pask - 1 and pjnk which have been shown to be key proteins in apoptosis .
the results showed that the expression of bcl - 2 was much higher in the i / r - m group , whereas the expression of bax , pask - 1 and pjnk was lower in the i / r - m group than in the i / r - p group ( fig. 3 ). fig. 3 an analysis of apoptotic factors 72 h after i / r. representative micrographs ( 400x ) of flap tissue immunohistochemistry for pask - 1 , pjnk , bcl - 2 and bax in all groups are presented above .
brown staining indicates positive expression areas , and the shade of color represents the expression level of the target protein .
the levels of pask - 1 , pjnk and bax were lower in the i / r - m group than in the i / r - p group , with bcl - 2 displaying the opposite pattern caspase - 3 activity caspase - 3 activity was clearly upregulated into the reperfusion process in the i / r - p group .
the rats subjected to skin flap i / r followed by mrs ( 0.63 +/ - 0.17 ) presented decreased in caspase - 3 activity compared with the i / r - p group ( 1.12 +/ - 0.25 ) rats ( fig. 4 ) .
in sham group , caspase - 3 activity was ( 0.032 +/ - 0.09 ) .
these data revealed that methane suppressed cell apoptosis via attenuated caspase - 3 activity. fig. 4 caspase - 3 activity in all groups 72 h after i / r. compared to the i / r - p group , caspase - 3 activity was significantly inhibited in the i / r - m group .
values are the means +/ - sem ;( n = 6 , * p < 0.05 , *** p < 0.001 versus the sh group ; ## p < 0.01 ) discussion in the plastic surgery field , flap complications often occur in flap transfer operations .
although many strategies , including pharmaceutical agents , preconditioning and postconditioning , have been investigated to prevent such unwanted outcomes , the total loss of skin flaps in microsurgical transplantation is approximately 1 % to 5 % in experienced hands , partial flap loss is 7 % to 20 % of free flaps and 20 % to 30 % of pedicled flaps [ 12 ] .
there are many reasons for flap failure , among which i / r injury is an important one .
neutrophil infiltration is a classic characteristic of acute inflammation during i / r injury , and has been shown to worsen reperfusion injury by leukocyte activation [ 2 ] .
in addition , apoptosis is induced by i / r process in skin - flap tissue and leads to cell shrinkage , nuclear condensation and cell death [ 3 ] , which is one of the worst outcomes for a skin flap .
many researchers have agreed that methane is a therapeutic agent .
according to the occupational safety and health administration of united states , methane has been regarded as a simple asphyxiant that is intrinsically nontoxic .
many antioxidants have limited therapeutic utility because of the impermeability of membranes [ 14 ] .
methane , which is a type of gas with small molecules , has the proper distribution characteristics to penetrate membranes and diffuse into organelles [ 7 , 15 ] .
in addition , in boros [ 10 ] and varga 's study [ 16 ] , data demonstrate the anti - inflammatory profile of methane during i / r process .
but there is no study about methane and skin flap research especially on apoptosis aspect .
therefore , our study focused on the protective effects of methane in regulating apoptosis level on i / r injury to rat abdominal skin flaps .
in our study , an abdominal - island skin - flap ischemia and reperfusion model induced by ligating the left superficial epigastric artery was used to investigate cellular and molecular changes after mrs treatment .
according to professor sun 's study [ 17 ] , methane is more effective in attenuating hepatic ischemia - reperfusion injury through injection than inhalation .
like hydrogen , methane is small molecules , which means most methane molecules could be released though interstitial space to the external besides the absorbed ones .
in this case , the injection of mrs was performed once every 12 h , which could not only maintain the effect of mrs but also avoid the intra - abdominal infection induced by repeated intraperitoneal injection .
after 6 h of ischemia and reperfusion , i / r injury was observed as large necrotic areas and low levels of flap blood perfusion .
intraperitoneal injection of mrs improved flap blood perfusion to increase the flap survival rate and attenuated cell apoptosis level and infiltration of inflammatory cells .
the mechanisms of cell apoptosis induced by i / r injury is still complicated with many signal pathways , proteins and enzymes involved .
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generated by tnf - alpha can oxidize the reduced thioredoxin - apoptosis signal - regulating kinase 1 complex ( trx ( sh ) 2 - ask - 1 ) , then activate ask - 1 and its downstream stress signaling targets , such as jnk [ 18 - 21 ] , and initiate the apoptosis procedure .
many proteins regulate the apoptosis process , among which one pair of proteins is paramount , the anti - apoptotic protein bcl - 2 and the pro - apoptotic protein bax .
these two proteins can combine to form a heterodimer and its ratio determines the fate of cells [ 22 ] .
caspase - 3 plays an irreplaceable role in facilitating the apoptosis process .
caspase - 3 can be activated by many factors , such as reactive oxygen species and the low expression of bcl - 2 .
activated caspase - 3 can cut parp ( poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase ) and increase the activity of ca2 +/ mg2 + - dependant endonuclease to destroy dna molecules [ 23 ] .
most studies explain the mechanisms of protective effects in terms of flap survival area , histological examination and other aspects .
however , our study focused not only on skin flap survival evaluation , but it also analyzed the results from the perspective of apoptosis , which offers a new approach to explaining the protective effects of mrs against i / r injury .
tunel staining and the expression of the bcl - 2 , bax , pask - 1 and pjnk proteins reflect the apoptotic condition .
moreover , caspase - 3 can be activated by reactive oxygen species and the low expression of bcl - 2 during i / r injury and promote the apoptosis .
in our results , bcl - 2 was expressed more highly in the i / r - m group than in the i / r - p group .
bcl - 2 was the first anti - apoptosis gene found and is a proto - oncogene .
bcl - 2 , known as a mitochondrial anchoring protein , may prevent a reputed reactive - oxygen - species - induced step during apoptosis by working like an antioxidant partner and regulating the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane [ 24 ] .
during apoptosis procedure , bcl - 2 inhibits bax relocalization , mitochondrial membrane depolarization , nuclear fragmentation , caspase activation and cytochrome - c release [ 25 , 26 ] .
the decline of active jnk and ask - 1 may have caused the bcl - 2 upregulation phenomenon in the i / r - m group .
the anti - apoptotic effects of bcl - 2 can be inhibited by enhanced bcl - 2 phosphorylation under certain specific stimuli [ 27 ] .
methane may improve the level of bcl - 2 indirectly through an unknown pathway .
in the i / r - p group , bax in the extracellular matrix formed homodimers and anchored on the outer mitochondrial membrane to build channels that released cytochrome - c and consequently induced apoptosis [ 28 ] .
compared with the i / r - p group , the expression level of bcl - 2 was higher and bax was markedly lower in the i / r - m group , so the formation of bax homodimer could be inhibited by a heterodimer of bcl - 2 and bax [ 29 ] .
the caspase - 3 activity results also indicated that apoptosis was clearly attenuated in the i / r - m group .
compared with former studies of apoptosis , our findings show similar results .
according to the immunohistochemical studies , the protective effect of mrs was revealed by the decreased expression levels of activated ask - 1 , jnk and bax , and the increased expression of bcl - 2 .
in addition to methane , many other gases have been discovered to have therapeutic effects , such as hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide [ 30 , 31 ] .
their protective effects are accepted and have been shown in animal models [ 31 - 33 ] .
however , the application of therapeutic gases in clinical work is still difficult because of their explosive and flammable properties and the difficulty of transportation .
however , these types of gases can dissolve in physiological saline at the proper concentration without any changes in their chemical properties .
thus , normal saline rich in therapeutic gas may be prepared as an injection which would be more practical and safer to use .
compared with hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide , methane is much cheaper and more easily produced , and moreover , methane can reach a higher concentration when dissolved in physiological saline [ 34 ] .
however , methane has been received much attention recently as a contributor to climate change and global warming .
therefore , the recycling of methane should be considered .
moreover , methane may be regarded as a factor in some gastrointestinal disorders [ 9 ] .
therefore , much more investigation is still needed before methane can be used in gastrointestinal diseases [ 15 ] .
conclusion according to the results of our study , compared with the i / r - p group , the skin flap survival rate was improved and the cell apoptotic condition was notably attenuated in the i / r - m group .
therefore , we postulate that mrs could be a novel anti - apoptotic agent with a promising role in decreasing i / r injury in rat abdominal skin flaps .

background : the global burden of conduct disorder is a major public health concern .
although there are different reports on the prevalence of conduct disorder in different middle eastern countries , to date , no research has reviewed them .
therefore , we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta - analysis on the literature and present the prevalence of conduct disorder among children and adolescents in middle eastern countries .
methods : those cross - sectional studies with any type of random or non - random sampling , which described the prevalence of conduct disorder prior to age of 18 , for at least one gender in the general or school - based populations who resided in middle eastern countries were included in this review .
the scientific databases of pubmed , scopus , google scholar , index medicus for the eastern mediterranean region ( imemr ) , islamic world science citation center ( isc ) , and grey literature including conference proceedings , and hand searching of key journals were searched from 1995 to the end of 2014 .
two reviewers assessed the quality of the included studies independently and extracted the relevant data .
discussion : this review provided a picture of different frequencies of conduct disorder in middle eastern countries and analyzed the sources of heterogeneity .
systematic review registration : prospero crd42014014996 key words conduct disorder the middle east systematic review prevalence conduct disorder is characterized by aggressive behaviors towards people and animals , deceitfulness or theft , destruction of property and serious violations of rules which persist in the child or adolescent during the past 12 months prior to age 18 ( 1 ) .
the global burden of conduct disorder is a major public health concern , particularly in males ( 2 ) .
the worldwide prevalence of conduct disorder was reported to be 3.6 % for males and 1.5 % for females , which was consistent in three time periods of 1990 , 2005 and 2010 ( 3 ) .
risk factors of conduct disorder include individual , family and social factors .
individual factors consist of impulsiveness , low autonomic baseline arousal , reduced excitability particularly to punishing stimuli , accelerated habituation , poor verbal skills , impairment in executive functioning , low orienting reaction , low iq and low educational achievement ; family factors involve poor parental supervision , inconsistent , neglectful or harsh discipline , authoritarian style of parenting , child abuse , parental conflict and disrupted families , antisocial parents and large family size ; and social factors include low socioeconomic level , delinquent peers , schools with high delinquency rate and high crime neighborhoods ( 4 - 7 ) .
several psychological interventions were suggested to reduce conduct disorder symptoms such as family and parenting interventions , multi - systemic therapy , parent management training , functional family therapy , various behavioral management strategies , multidimensional treatment foster care and cognitive - behavior skills building programs ( 8 - 10 ) .
several studies reported the prevalence of conduct disorder in different middle eastern countries ; for instance , mohammadi et al .
( 2014 ) revealed a prevalence rate of 32.9 % for conduct disorder in iranian children and adolescents ( 11 ) .
another research which was conducted on 6 - 12 - year - old children in egypt reported the prevalence of conduct disorder to be 25.3 % ( 12 ) .
in this systematic review , we aimed to investigate the prevalence of conduct disorder in the middle east .
although there are different reports of prevalence of conduct disorder in different regions of the middle east , to date , no research has reviewed them .
therefore , we conducted a systematic review and meta - analysis on the literature and presented the prevalence of conduct disorder among children and adolescents in the middle east .
also , the heterogeneity of conduct disorder frequencies in the various countries of the middle east was assessed , and the potential sources of heterogeneity were analyzed .
methods inclusion and exclusion criteria cross - sectional studies including descriptive and survey studies , with any type of random or non - random sampling were included in this systematic review .
the included studies described the prevalence of conduct disorder among children and adolescents prior to age of 18 for both genders , and at least one gender , in the general or school - based populations , residing in middle eastern countries .
moreover , the included studies defined conduct disorder based on the third , fourth and fifth versions of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm ) .
we excluded clinical or interventional studies , and researches reporting the prevalence of conduct disorder with comorbidities , and we also excluded those studies conducted on single or high - risk groups .
search strategy to identify the included studies , we systematically searched five databases including pubmed , scopus , google scholar , index medicus for the eastern mediterranean region ( imemr ) , and islamic world science citation center ( isc ) .
we also searched grey literature including conference proceedings .
moreover , hand searching of key journals and reference lists of all the included studies were reviewed .
moreover , we searched all studies from 1995 to the end of 2014 .
the following key - terms were included : conduct disorder , prevalence , and the middle eastern countries ( table 1 ) .
also , title and abstract tags were used for " conduct disorder " , and " prevalence " search terms .
each member of the " middle eastern countries " was searched by title and abstract , place of journal publication , and affiliation tags .
search terms were combined with " or " and " and " operators .
the two authors selected the included studies independently based on the full texts .
data collection and analysis data extraction relevant data were independently extracted from the included studies and entered into the data extraction form by the two reviewers , who resolved the inconsistencies of the extracted data through consensus .
the extracted data included the followings : the first author , publication year , journal , survey years , study design , name and population of the study location ( country , province / state , city ) , district of study location ( urban / rural ) , sample size , response rate , gender , age , type of sampling , sample population ( general / school - based ) , type of school ( state / private ) , instruments , paternal and maternal occupation , level of paternal and maternal education , number of siblings , family income , maternal and paternal loss , addiction and crime of family .
quality assessment for this review , we used the method and result sections of the strobe checklist for quality assessment of the selected cross - sectional studies ( 13 ) .
this tool evaluates the quality of included studies across six core components including study design , participants , bias , measurement , descriptive and outcome data .
this review was done according to prisma checklist .
two reviewers assessed the quality of included studies independently .
statistical analysis and data synthesis we used graphical methods and fixed or random effect models for the statistical analysis of the data .
sub - groups analysis or meta - regression was used to assess the sources of heterogeneity .
also , sensitivity analysis was performed , and publication bias was assessed using graphical methods and statistical tests .
discussion in this review , we investigated the studies conducted on the prevalence of conduct disorder in middle eastern countries from 1995 to the end of 2014 in order to analyze the sources of heterogeneity .
the findings revealed a picture of different frequencies of conduct disorder in middle eastern countries , and contributed to a better understanding of the heterogeneities among the various reported prevalence rates of conduct disorder .
the findings of this review may improve policy decisions , leading to a reduction in conduct disorder symptoms and providing improved special services for children and adolescents with conduct disorder .
limitation we will not be able to combine or meta - analyze the results , if there is methodological heterogeneity between the studies .
also , we may not be able to access to all gray literature in our review .
conclusion this review provided a picture of different frequencies of conduct disorder in middle eastern countries and analyzed the sources of heterogeneity .

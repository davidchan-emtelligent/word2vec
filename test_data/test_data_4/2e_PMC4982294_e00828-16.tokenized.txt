members of the escherichia coli bacterial family have been grouped as eskape ( enterococcus faecium , staphylococcus aureus , klebsiella pneumoniae , acinetobacter baumannii , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and enterobacter species ) pathogens because of their extensive drug resistance phenotypes and increasing threat to human health .
the genomes of six extended - spectrum beta - lactamase ( esbl ) - producing e. coli strains isolated from wounded military personnel were sequenced and annotated .
the u.s. department of defense ( dod ) http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 100000005w81xwh - 12 - 2 - 0035luis a. actiscover - datejuly / august 2016 genome announcement escherichia coli is a gram - negative bacillus that is a component of the normal bacterial flora of the human colonic tract ( 1 - 3 ). e. coli within the intestinal tract is typically nonpathogenic unless the intestinal tract barriers have been violated or the host has been immunocompromised ; however , there are also several highly adapted e. coli clones that have evolved to cause human diseases including meningitis , diarrhea , sepsis , and urinary tract infections ( 3 ) .
in fact , e. coli is the most common gram - negative pathogen associated with nosocomial infections , and isolates with the ability to produce extended - spectrum beta - lactamase ( esbl ) continue to increase in frequency and severity ( 4 , 5 ) .
the genomes of six esbl - producing isolates obtained from wounded soldiers at the walter reed army medical center ( wramc ) were sequenced using next - generation sequencing methods for future analyses to elucidate their virulence mechanisms .
as described previously , strains were routinely stored at - 80degreesc in 10 % glycerol ( 6 ) .
dna was isolated from overnight lb cultures grown with agitation at 37degreesc using the dneasy blood and tissue kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca , usa ) .
absorption at 260 nm and 280 nm was measured for each sample to determine dna quantity and quality using a nanodrop 2000 ( thermo scientific , wilmington , de , usa ) .
dna concentrations for library preparation were determined by the sybr green ( life technologies , grand island , ny , usa ) standard curve method in black 96 - well plates ( corning , tewksbury , ma , usa ) using a filtermax f5 spectrophotometer with multi - mode analysis software version 3.4.0.25 ( molecular devices , sunnyvale , ca , usa ) .
whole dna was sheared to approximately 500 bp in a microtube - 50 using the m220 focused - ultrasonicator ( covaris , woburn , ma , usa ) .
fragmentation of resultant libraries was examined with a bioanalyzer 2100 high sensitivity dna analysis kit ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca , usa ) using version b.02.08.si648 software .
individual libraries were normalized , pooled , and then sequenced using miseq v3 600 - cycle kit ( illumina , san diego , ca , usa ) to perform 300 - bp paired - end sequencing on a miseq instrument ( illumina ) per manufacturer 's instructions .
de novo assembly was performed using genomics workbench 8.0 with the bacterial genome finishing module ( clc bio , boston , ma , usa ) on a workstation with an amd opteron 2.10 ghz 16 - core processor with 128 gb ddr3 ecc ram .
prokka version 1.10 on a quadcore i7 workstation with 32 gb ddr3 running ubuntu 14.04 lts ( 7 ) was used for genome annotation .
the de novo assembly statistics for the sequenced e. coli isolates are shown in table 1 .

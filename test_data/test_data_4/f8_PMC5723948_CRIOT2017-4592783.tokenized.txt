background thyroid carcinoma complicated by hemiagenesis is very rare , and previous reports have not described this cancer on the side of the absent lobe .
methods and results we report the case of a 64 - year - old woman in whom left thyroid hemiagenesis was discovered incidentally during investigations of abnormal sensation during swallowing .
a tumorous 1.4 cm lesion was also found on the side of the absent lobe , left of the isthmus .
fine - needle aspiration biopsy revealed class v papillary carcinoma , but no lymph node metastases .
total thyroidectomy was performed for stage ct1bn0m0 carcinoma .
histopathology revealed normal thyroid tissues in the right lobe and isthmus , while the left lobe was absent .
the mostly papillary carcinoma was adjacent to the truncated thyroid tissue , with a portion histologically consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma .
conclusions all previously reported cases of thyroid cancer complicated by hemiagenesis have represented carcinoma occurring within the present lobe .
this case is extremely rare .
1. introduction thyroid hemiagenesis is an extremely rare congenital abnormality , with a reported prevalence of 0.02 - 0.2 % [ 1 , 2 ] .
this pathology is often discovered during detailed examinations for abnormal thyroid function and thyroid diseases such as goiter .
only 13 previous cases of thyroid cancer concurrent with thyroid hemiagenesis have been reported .
tumors in each of those cases occurred in the remaining thyroid tissue ; no previous reports have described thyroid carcinoma occurring on the side of the absent thyroid lobe .
we report a case of thyroid carcinoma arising on the side of the absent lobe .
to the best of our knowledge , this represents the first report of its kind .
although the cause of onset is unclear , we discuss our hypotheses regarding the tumorigenic mechanisms of thyroid carcinoma in this case .
2. case presentation a 64 - year - old woman was referred to our department for evaluation of a thyroid mass discovered incidentally during examinations for symptoms of abnormal sensation during swallowing .
the patient had no history of previous surgery or radiotherapy to the neck .
she had no significant past medical history .
no family history of thyroid disorders was elicited .
examination of the neck revealed a firm mass with irregular edges and little mobility .
no cervical lymphadenopathy was evident .
examination of the oral cavity , pharynx , and larynx showed findings within normal limits , with mobile vocal cords .
ultrasonography and computed tomography ( ct ) did not show a left lobe of the thyroid , but the right lobe and isthmus were identified .
a 0.7 x 0.8 x 1.4 cm hypoechoic nodule with small calcifications and attenuation of posterior echo and a 0.8 x 0.7 cm enhanced nodule with clear borders were identified on the left side of the isthmus ( figure 1 ) .
ultrasonography and ct did not reveal enlarged lymph nodes on either side of the neck .
ct also did not reveal metastatic tumors in the lungs .
serum thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) was 1.35 muiu / ml ( normal range : 0.35 - 4.94 muiu / ml ) , free triiodothyronine ( ft3 ) was 2.87 pg / ml ( normal range : 1.71 - 3.71 pg / ml ) , free thyroxine ( ft4 ) was 1.43 ng / dl ( normal range : 0.70 - 1.48 ng / dl ) , and thyroglobulin was 12.93 ng / ml ( normal range : 0 - 32.7 ng / ml ) .
ultrasonography - guided fine - needle aspiration cytology identified the nodule as papillary thyroid carcinoma .
the patient underwent surgery using a standard collar incision .
intraoperative findings confirmed the presence of the right lobe and isthmus , the absence of the left lobe , and the presence of a firm nodule with infiltration into the muscle tissue surrounding the site of the absent lobe on the left of the isthmus after abduction of the anterior cervical muscles .
total right thyroid lobectomy isthmectomy , resection of the tumor , and central neck dissection were performed concurrently .
the tumor had invaded the lateral branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve , which was also resected , but the medial branch of the recurrent nerve was preserved ( figure 2 ) .
on the side of the absent thyroid , the superior thyroid artery , superior thyroid vein , middle thyroid artery , inferior thyroid artery , inferior thyroid vein , and parathyroid glands were in the normal locations .
no abnormality was evident in the pathway of the recurrent laryngeal nerve .
postoperative histopathological examination found that the right lobe and isthmus were present and the left lobe was absent .
the tumor was adjacent to the left side of the isthmus ( figure 3 ) , and a clear demarcation was evident between the thyroid and tumor ( figure 4 ) .
most of the tumor was consistent with thyroid papillary carcinoma with a funicular - and microfollicular - shaped ductal structure , and nuclear grooves were observed within the tumor cells at high magnification ( figures 5 and 5 ) .
a honeycomb structure and necrosis were observed in a section of the infiltrating tumor , and a marked difference was seen in the sizes of nuclei , indicative of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma ( figure 5 ) .
in addition , immunohistochemical staining showed that both the papillary and poorly differentiated carcinomas were thyroid transcription factor - ( ttf - ) 1 - positive , suggesting that the carcinomas originated from thyroid tissue ( figures 5 and 5 ) .
the final diagnosis was concomitant papillary thyroid carcinoma and poorly differentiated carcinoma pt4pn0pex2 , with recurrent laryngeal nerve invasion .
at 3 months postoperatively , the patient underwent 131i ablation on an outpatient basis .
subsequent thyroid scintigraphy indicated no accumulation of radioactive iodine .
the patient has remained recurrence - free as of 3 years postoperatively , and observation is continuing .
3. discussion thyroid hemiagenesis was first reported by henle in 1866 [ 3 ] .
the thyroid develops via epithelial cell proliferation from the foramen cecum of the tongue between the tuberculum impar and copula linguae in week 5 of gestation .
the gland subsequently descends as a diverticulum dividing into right and left lobes , reaching the anterior of the trachea in week 7 of gestation [ 4 ] .
thyroid hemiagenesis is postulated to be caused by failure of the diverticulum to divide , but some reports have also described associations between a lingual thyroid and hemiagenesis [ 5 , 6 ] .
confirmation that other locations remain free of abnormal accumulation on thyroid scintigraphy is therefore necessary , even if thyroid hemiagenesis is observed on ultrasonography , ct , or other modalities .
in this case , thyroid scintigraphy was not performed before surgery .
however , no abnormal accumulation was detected at other sites on thyroid scintigraphy performed postoperatively following 131i ablation .
only 13 cases of thyroid cancer complicated by thyroid hemiagenesis have been reported [ 7 - 18 ] .
these cases included 11 female and two male patients , ranging between 14 and 74 years in age .
in eight of these 13 cases , the tumors were discovered by palpation following cervical swelling or nodule detection .
five cases , including ours , were asymptomatic .
papillary carcinoma was the most common histology in 10 cases , with one case of follicular carcinoma , one of medullary carcinoma , and one of combined papillary and follicular carcinoma .
our case showed a combination of papillary and poorly differentiated carcinomas , representing the first case in which poorly differentiated carcinoma was identified .
among cases reported to date , the left side of the thyroid was absent in eight patients , and the right side was absent in five .
tumors in all cases except ours arose in the existing parts of the thyroid ( i.e. , in the lobe or isthmus ) .
in our case , however , the tumor arose on the side of the absent thyroid .
the fact that positive results for ttf - 1 were obtained for both the papillary and poorly differentiated carcinoma sites suggested that the cancer originated in the thyroid .
however , checking for thyroid tissues on the side of the absent thyroid was not possible , so the origin of the thyroid cancer in our patient could not be confirmed .
we formulated three hypotheses regarding thyroid carcinogenesis in our patient ( figure 6 ) , as outlined below .
theory 1 .
hypoplasia of the left thyroid lobe plus thyroid cancer arising on the hypoplastic side .
this hypothesis was ruled out , as the cancer was not contiguous with thyroid gland tissue on histopathological examination .
theory 2 .
thyroid hemiagenesis plus thyroid microcancer plus lymph node metastasis .
an extremely small primary lesion could have been present within thyroid tissue in the right lobe , with further lymph node metastasis to the site of the absent gland on the left resulting in the lesion .
multiple reports have described thyroid microcancer and lymph node metastasis to date , as reviewed by anastasilakis et al .
[ 19 ] even a primary as small as 2 mm can lead to cervical lymph node metastasis .
in our case , pathological examination of the residual thyroid using 5 mm thick slices found no microcancer .
in addition , we were unable to confirm the existence of lymph tissue on the tumor side .
this hypothesis thus does not seem to be supported .
theory 3 .
thyroid hemiagenesis plus ectopic thyroid carcinoma .
ectopic noncontiguous thyroid could have been present with residual thyroid on the absent side , where the cancer originated and eventually replaced the ectopic thyroid .
this is very rare , as only five cases have been reported in which thyroid hemiagenesis was complicated by an ectopic thyroid [ 5 , 6 , 13 , 20 , 21 ] , and none involved cancer .
in addition , ectopic thyroids are mainly observed originating from the tongue , in front of the larynx , or ( rarely ) at the paratrachea , esophagus , or within the mediastinum [ 22 ] .
in the present case , the cancer could have developed in an ectopic thyroid arising paratracheally following thyroid hemiagenesis .
however , the lack of thyroid tissue on the tumor side makes this hypothesis difficult to substantiate .
although we consider hypothesis 3 as the most likely , the mechanism of onset in this case of thyroid carcinoma on the side of the absent thyroid cannot be confirmed .
in summary , this case report appears to represent the first to describe thyroid hemiagenesis complicated by thyroid carcinoma occurring on the side of the absent thyroid and is therefore extremely rare .
conflicts of interest the authors have no conflicts of interest to declare .

http :// journalrip.com introduction : thrombotic microangiopathy ( tma ) is a serious complication of renal transplantation and is mostly related to the prothrombotic effect of calcineurin inhibitors ( cnis ) .
a subset of tma ( 29 % - 38 %) is localized only to the graft .
case 1 : a young woman suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( adpkd ) underwent kidney transplant .
after 2 months , she showed slow renal deterioration ( serum creatinine from 1.9 to 3.1 mg / dl ) , without hematological signs of hemolytic - uremic syndrome ( hus ) ; only ldh enzyme transient increase was detected .
renal biopsy showed tma : temporary withdraw of tacrolimus and plasmapheresis was performed .
the renal function recovered ( serum creatinine 1.9 mg / dl ). from screening for thrombophilia , we found a mutation of the leiden factor v gene .
case 2 : a man affected by adpkd underwent kidney transplantation , with delay graft function ; first biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis , but a second biopsy revealed tma , while no altered hematological parameters of hus was detected .
we observed only a slight increase of lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) levels .
the tacrolimus was halved and plasmapheresis was performed : ldh levels normalized within 10 days and renal function improved ( serum creatinine from 9 to 2.9 mg / dl ) .
we found a mutation of the prothrombin gene .
only a renal biopsy clarifies the diagnosis of tma , but it is necessary to pay attention to light increasing level of ldh .
conclusion : prothrombotic effect of cnis and mtor inhibitor , mutation of genes encoding factor h or i , anticardiolipin antibodies , vascular rejection , cytomegalovirus infection are proposed to trigger tma ; we detected mutations of factor ii and leiden factor v , as facilitating conditions for tma in patients affected by adpkd .

doi : 10.12861 / jrip.2015.28 implication for health policy / practice / research / medical education : thrombotic microangiopathy ( tma ) is a serious complication of renal transplantation and is mostly related to the prothrombotic effect of calcineurin inhibitors ( cnis ) .
a subset of tma ( 29 % - 38 %) is localized only to the graft .
anomalies of coagulation can be permissive for the development of tma .
introduction thrombotic microangiopathy ( tma ) is a pathological process of microvascular thrombosis , thrombocitopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , with ischemia and occasionally infarction , affecting particularly the kidney and the brain ( 1 ) .
tma is a recognized and destructive process in renal transplantation , affecting 3 % to 14 % of patients on calcineurin inhibitors ( cnis ) therapy ( 2 - 5 ) .
it produces narrowing or occlusion of capillaries , fibrinoid change in the intima of small arteries and subendothelial accumulation of amorphous material in glomeruli .
a subset of tma ( 29 % - 38 %) is localized only to the graft and patients do not show the classical signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome .
the clinical presentation of tma is variable , often shows systemic signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome ( hus ) , with findings of hemolytic - anemia , rapid deterioration of renal function , peripheral schistocytes , and thrombocytopenia , but cases of tma only localized to the allograft do not present systemic manifestation of hus .
cnis , mtor inhibitors , viral infections , ischemia - reperfusion injury , acute rejection , mutation of genes encoding factor h or i , anticardiolipin antibodies predispose to post - transplant tma ( 6,7 ) , but no coagulation genetic alterations were described to facilitate this serious complication of renal transplantation .
we describe two cases of de novo tma localized only to the graft in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( adpkd ) with thrombophilia .
case i a 39 - year - old - woman , suffering from adpkd , diagnosed at 14 - year - old owing to gross hematuria , was on hemodialysis for one year before the transplant .
the patient received a kidney transplantation from a 52 years - old deceased due to cerebral hemorrhage with 14 hours of cold ischemic time .
the hla mismatch was 1 and his immunosuppression consisted of two intravenous doses of basiliximab , the first dose ( 20 mg ) preoperatively and the second dose ( 20 mg ) on postoperative day 4 , a methyprednisolon taper to 5 mg daily , mycophenolate and tacrolimus as maintenance .
we observed an incomplete recovery of renal function ( serum creatinine : 1.9 mg / dl ) .
after 2 months from kidney transplantation , she showed a slow renal deterioration ( until serum creatinine ; 3.9 mg / dl ) , without humoral signs of hemolytic syndrome .
however only a transient increase of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme ( ldh ) was seen ( figure 1 ) .
an allograft kidney biopsy was performed and renal biopsy specimen showed fragmented red blood cells in the glomeruli , partial occlusion of capillaries , fibrinoid change in the intima of small arteries and subendothelial accumulation of amorphous material ( figure 2a - c ) .
c4d was negative .
immediately , temporary withdraw of tacrolimus was performed and a plasmapheresis cycle ( five sessions of plasma - exchanges ) was made .
the renal function slowly recovered and it was stabilized ( serum creatinine : 1.8 mg / dl ) after two years from the de novo tma .
genetic coagulation abnormality study was performed and we found a heterozygous mutation of factor v leiden gene .
search for mutations of gene encoding factor h and i was negative .
figure 1 case i. lactate dehydrogenase enzyme ( ldh ) value , haptoglobin level and platelets count before and after biopsy , that showed localized thrombotic microangiopathy after two months from kidney transplant .
figure 2 case i. renal biopsy specimen demonstrated histopathological glomerular characteristics of tma ( 400x ) . a ) dilatation of capillaries , stasis and thrombosis ( masson 's trichrome ) .
b ) thrombosis in dilated capillary lumina ( periodic schiff - methenamine ) .
c ) mesangiolysis and dilated capillary lumina ( periodic acid schiff ) .
case ii in a 68 - year - old man , adpkd was diagnosed at 57 - year - old .
in 2012 , he underwent kidney transplantation from a 60 - year - old woman deceased due cerebral hemorrhage , with 15 hours of cold ischemic time .
the hla mismatch was 4 and the immunosuppression consisted of two intravenous doses of basiliximab ( 20 mg ) , a methylprednisolon taper to 5 mg daily , mycophenolate and tacrolimus as maintenance .
a prolonged delay graft function with oligo - anuria characterized the clinical course .
a first biopsy after 10 days showed an acute tubular necrosis .
a second biopsy does not contain glomeruli , and a third biopsy , done at day 45 showed an extensive tma .
the renal biopsy specimen demonstrated arteriolar thrombi , occlusion of glomerular capillaries by amorphous material , fragmented red blood cells in glomeruli ( figure 3a - c ) .
no signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome were detected .
again , we observed only a persistent slight increase of ldh .
the tacrolimus was interrupted and ldh levels , in addition to renal function , were strictly observed .
ldh level normalized within 10 days , diuresis increased and became effective with partial , but satisfactory recovery of renal function ( serum creatinine ; 2.9 mg / dl ) .
after four years from the de novo tma , we observed further amelioration ( serum creatinine : 1.5 mg / dl ) .
also for this patient , genetic coagulation abnormality study was performed , and we found a heterozygous mutation of the prothrombin gene ( factor ii ) .
figure 3 case ii. renal biopsy specimen showed glomerular lesions in thrombotic microangiopathy ( tma ) ( 400x ) . a ) focal fibrinoid necrosis .
( masson 's trichrome ) .
b ) most capillary lumina closed ( pas ) .
c ) thickening of the capillary walls and thrombosis ( pasm ) .
discussion tma is a serious complication of renal transplantation , affecting 3 % to 14 % of patients .
it can occur as a recurrent or de novo disease .
in a retrospective review by schwimmer et al ( 2 ) between 21 of 742 kidney transplant recipients suffering from tma , 38 % showed localized tma .
patients with systemic and localized tma did not differ significantly with respect to age , sex , race , type of donor and pre - transplant diagnosis , and despite systemic and localized tma have different characteristics and clinical course , long - term graft survival was similarly poor ( graft loss 14 % to 57 % in published case series ) .
conversely , in other published studies ( 8,9 ) , a high proportion of patients suffering from localized tma showed lower rates of tma - related graft loss ( 0 % to 12 %) .
we have described two cases of kidney transplantation suffering from tma due cnis , facilitated by genetic coagulation abnormalities , with a favorable outcome and a very good follow - up. toxicity by cnis is the main etiologic factor of the disease , because cnis induce arteriolar vasoconstriction due to production of vasoconstrictive factors , for increased sensitivity to endothelin - i and low synthesis of prostacyclin or nitric oxide .
furthermore , cnis could promote a pro - coagulant state by enhancing platelet aggregation ( 10 ) .
moreover , mtor inhibitor , viral infection , ischemia - reperfusion injury , viral infection ( cmv , parvovirus b19 and polioma bk ) antibody - mediated rejection and antiphospholipid antibodies are other frequent etiologic agents .
the coagulation abnormality is not investigated enough in this disease , although microvascular thrombosis is the hallmark of tma .
we have described two different anomalies of coagulation state in apkd patients .
the mutation of factor v leiden ( three heterozygous , and one homozygous ) was described by raife et al ( 11 ) in a white tma patient , who had normal von willebrand factor - cleaving protease ( vwcp ) .
on the other hand , no factor ii allele abnormality was detected in patients suffering from tma with normal or deficient vwcp .
inactivation of factor va by activated protein c is impaired in patients with factor leiden mutation .
it is possible that , it is implicated in the thrombomodulin / protein c anticoagulant pathway in tma .
in conclusion , factor v leiden may be among a constellation of genetic risks permissive of the development of tma , when cnis exposition is present , as in the cases we have described here .
localized tma has a variable clinical presentation , as no signs of hemolytic anemia , schistocytes , thrombocytopenia and low haptoglobin level was observed .
only a moderate increase of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme was seen and only renal biopsy is really diagnostic .
conclusion tma is a complication of renal transplantation and is mostly related to the prothrombotic effect of cni .
a subset of tma ( 29 % - 38 %) is localized only to the graft , and only slight elevation of ldh level can be seen .
anomalies of coagulation in patients suffering from adpkd can be permissive for the development of tma .

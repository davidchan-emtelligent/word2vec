chronic mastitis is a prolonged inflammatory breast disease , and little is known about its etiology .
we identified 85 cases and 112 controls from 5 hospitals in morocco and egypt .
cases were women with chronic mastitis ( including periductal , lobular , granulomatous , lymphocytic , and duct ectasia with mastitis ) .
controls had benign breast disease , including fibroadenoma , benign phyllodes , and adenosis .
both groups were identified from histopathologically diagnosed patients from 2008 to 2011 , frequency - matched on age .
patient interviews elicited demographic , reproductive , breastfeeding , and clinical histories .
cases had higher parity than controls ( or = 1.75 , 1.62 - 1.90 ) and more reported history of contraception use ( or = 2.73 , 2.07 - 3.61 ) .
cases were less likely to report wearing a bra ( or = 0.56 , 0.47 - 0.67 ) and less often used both breasts for breastfeeding ( or = 4.40 , 3.39 - 5.72 ) .
chronic mastitis cases were significantly less likely to be employed outside home ( or = 0.71 , 0.60 - 0.84 ) and more likely to report mice in their households ( or = 1.63 , 1.36 - 1.97 ) .
this is the largest case - control study reported to date on risk factors for chronic mastitis .
our study highlights distinct reproductive risk factors for the disease .
future studies should further explore these factors and the possible immunological and susceptibility predisposing conditions .
1. introduction chronic mastitis ( cm ) is a group of diseases characterized by chronic inflammation of the breast , affecting mainly women of reproductive age in their fourth decade [ 1 - 3 ] .
cm is histopathologically defined as inflammation of the breast , with the microabscess formation and / or the presence of granulomas [ 1 ] .
this disease generally involves the breast unilaterally and may affect every quadrant region except for the subareolar area [ 2 ] .
cases mainly present with a breast mass , which may involve the overlying skin or penetrate the underlying pectoralis muscle with nipple retraction , sinus formation , and axillary lymphadenopathy [ 1 ] .
other symptoms may include galactorrhea , inflammation , pain , peau d'orange , tumorous indurations , nipple retraction and / or discharge , diffuse heaviness and enlargement , and ulcerations of the skin [ 4 ] .
the disease may be locally aggressive with a recurrence rate between 16 % and 50 % [ 1 ] .
due to this variable clinical presentation and these similarities in symptoms as well as clinical and radiological findings with inflammatory breast cancer , diagnosis is difficult and must be confirmed histopathologically after surgical excision or core biopsy [ 1 ] .
diagnosis of cm should be done after exclusion of other causes of infective lesions of the breast including brucellosis , filariasis , actinomycosis , sarcoidosis , histoplasmosis , wegner 's granulomatosis , giant - cell arteritis , duct ectasia , fat necrosis , and breast cancer [ 2 , 4 ] .
known etiologies of cm are diverse and include diabetes , lupus erythematosus , mycobacterium tuberculosis , staphylococcus aureus , and candida albicans , as well as several species of corynebacterium and other rare syndromes and infections [ 3 - 5 ] .
several other suspected predisposing or related diseases have been mentioned in the literature , including weber - christian disease , sjogren 's syndrome , hyperprolactinemia , igg4 sclerosing disease , immune response to local trauma , and even cat scratch disease [ 6 - 10 ] .
however , many cases of cm are idiopathic , presenting difficulties for determining the etiology and optimal treatment .
nearly all published case series on cm find that the average age of women at presentation is in their fourth decade [ 1 - 4 , 11 - 14 ] .
studies have suggested risk factors involving parity , breastfeeding habits , contraception use , socioeconomic status , and treatment patterns ; however , all of these stated risks are based on physicians' observations in small case series reports and have not been studied epidemiologically .
the prevalence of cm is generally reported at less than 1 % worldwide among women presenting with breast problems in studied hospitals ; however , reports vary greatly by country and ethnic group .
reports from pakistan show prevalence at less than 1 % among women undergoing biopsy for breast diseases [ 15 ] , and a study of granulomatous mastitis ( gm ) in the united states demonstrated a prevalence of less than 1 % among women who underwent biopsy for breast diseases [ 11 ] .
in the uk , periductal mastitis was found in 0.98 % of patients presenting at the breast unit [ 16 ] .
a second us - based study of gm found a prevalence of 2.4 / 100,000 women ; however , the prevalence was 12 times higher among hispanic women [ 17 ] .
a study in saudi arabia found idiopathic granulomatous mastitis ( igm ) , one form of chronic mastitis , to be 1.8 % of cases presenting with breast diseases [ 12 ] ; likewise , a study in turkey found that 6.8 % of patients undergoing surgery for benign breast diseases had gm [ 18 ] .
initial reports from hospitals in morocco [ 19 ] and egypt [ 20 ] , as well as our review of chronic mastitis diagnoses at the department of pathology at the national cancer institute of cairo university , indicate that the disease may be less rare than in the developed countries , with prevalence rates estimated between 1 % and 10 % .
however , due to the lack of access to specialized care , cases captured in tertiary hospitals and cancer centers are likely to be a very low estimate of total prevalence within these countries .
given the rarity of cm worldwide , little is known about etiology , risk factors , and treatment .
a thorough literature review of pubmed , scopus , and isi web of knowledge using the search term " breast disease or mastitis or chronic mastitis or granulomatous mastitis " and covering 1960 through 2011 revealed that almost all published studies are hospital - based case - series reports .
the largest series we identified involved 54 patients with cm [ 11 ] .
the only exception is one small retrospective case - control study of 18 cases of gm [ 14 ] .
therefore , a major gap seems to exist in the literature regarding epidemiological study of chronic mastitis .
the current state of knowledge on cm is inadequate to inform treatment protocols , prevention efforts , or patient education .
no risk factors are statistically shown to be associated with cm , severely limiting the potential prevention efforts .
the lack of information , combined with the relatively high estimated prevalence in north africa , created an optimal setting for the study of a neglected rare disease .
the aim of this study was to identify potential risk factors for cm to inform future clinical research and possible prevention interventions .
based on a previous case - series work , we hypothesized that breastfeeding and reproductive factors would have important associations with diagnosis of cm .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
study population we preformed a retrospective hospital - based case - control study and identified 85 cases of cm and 112 controls from 5 hospitals in morocco and egypt .
the hospitals in morocco included l'hopital ibn rochd , hassan ii university , in casablanca , and l'hopital ibn tofail in marrakech .
the hospitals in egypt were cairo university medical school in cairo , the mansoura university oncology center in mansoura city ( in the east nile delta region ) , and the tanta cancer center in tanta , in the center of the nile delta region .
these hospitals were chosen because of their relatively high reported number of cm cases .
cases were defined as any female patient with histopathological diagnosis of chronic mastitis ( periductal , lobular , granulomatous , lymphocytic , and duct ectasia with mastitis ) seen at the study hospitals between 2008 and 2011 .
the only exclusion criterion was previous diagnosis of malignancy .
controls were women with histopathologic diagnoses of other forms of benign breast diseases , excluding mastitis and malignancy , and including fibroadenoma , benign phyllodes , and adenosis , diagnosed at the same hospitals during the same period .
the control conditions were chosen based on no suspected association with breast cancer .
cases and controls identified from pathology records of each collaborating hospital were frequency age - matched within +/ - 5 years .
pathological records of the study subjects were linked to their medical records , and both were abstracted for relevant information .
any contact information available from medical records was used to contact and obtain consent from patients , as well as to conduct a follow - up interview .
the consent process and interview were generally conducted in tandem by an arabic - speaking interviewer over the telephone .
at the mansoura study site in egypt , interviews were conducted in a face - to - face format at the hospital .
no incentive was provided to interview , and the overall response rate among those contacted was 89 % .
the 2008 - 2011 databases of the pathology departments of the participating hospitals included 204 cases and 419 controls meeting the study criteria ( figure 1 ). of these subjects originally identified , 165 cases and 251 controls were linked to existing medical records .
seventy - four cases and 79 controls had working contact information and were contacted for interviews. of these subjects , 66 cases and 78 controls gave interview responses .
an additional 19 cases and 34 controls had sufficient information contained in their records to complete the interview questions and were included in the analysis , for a total of 85 cases and 112 controls .
2.2 .
data collection interviewer - administered questionnaire included questions on demographics , reproductive history , breastfeeding history , hormone use , menstrual and menopause history , and occupational history , as well as a section on description of symptoms and treatment for their breast diseases .
this questionnaire was a shortened version of a risk - factor assessment that was pilot - tested for reliability and validity in morocco and egypt [ 21 ] and is currently in use in our ongoing study of the epidemiology of breast cancer in north africa .
the study questionnaire was translated from english into arabic by an experienced native - speaking translator .
the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the university of michigan , as well as by ethics boards at all collaborating institutions .
2.3 .
statistical analysis data were compiled and imported into sas , version 9.1 , statistical software ( sas institute , car , nc , usa ) for statistical analysis .
crude associations were assessed by frequency tables and descriptive statistics , and differences between cases and controls were tested by chi - square tests or fisher 's exact tests for categorical variables and by student 's t - tests for continuous variables , with a two - sided significance level of alpha = 0.05 .
bivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression , adjusted for age and hospital site in the model to control matching factors , to assess significance of variables as risk factors for case status .
due to the small sample size and the large number of strata created in the presence of two matching factors , conditional logistic regression was not used .
the dataset was then imputed twenty times to allow for complete - case analysis by logistic regression .
imputation was carried out using iveware , imputation and variance estimation version 0.2 , survey methodology program ( survey research center , institute for social research , university of mi , usa ) .
following imputation , the complete set of twenty datasets was used to conduct bivariate analyses and multivariate analyses , adjusted for age and study site , to model predictors of the dichotomous outcome cases status and create an integrated predictive model .
in the crude modeling of variables , 10 factors were shown to be significant at alpha <= 0.05 .
these variables were then included in an adjusted model , and all but 1 variable remained significant .
this variable was " breastfed at least one child ," as its significance was accounted for in the variables " breastfed all children " and " did not breastfeed. " additionally , 3 interaction terms were shown to significantly predict case status in the fully adjusted model , and these were included in the final analysis .
3. results table 1 provides information on the sociodemographic characteristics of the study population , divided by case status and compared by chi - square or fischer 's exact tests .
nineteen cases were recruited from morocco and 66 cases from egypt .
the median age of cases at presentation was 33 ( range : 17 - 59 years ) .
cases and controls had similar rates of urban versus rural residence ( 63 % and 61 % , resp. ) ; however , controls were significantly more likely to be employed outside home ( 32 % of controls versus 11 % of cases , p = 0.005 ) .
table 2 compares reproductive characteristics between cases and controls .
significantly larger numbers of cases ( 96 %) were parous , compared to only 67 % of controls ( p < 0.0001 ) .
additionally , cases had a higher average parity of 3.46 births than controls , 2.30 births ( p = 0.0002 ) .
median ages at first birth ( 22 years ) and last birth ( 29 years ) were the same for cases and controls .
similar frequencies of miscarriage ( 12 %) , irregular menstruation ( 18 %) , and infertility ( 13 %) were seen among cases and controls .
a significantly higher proportion of cases reported past use of contraceptive methods ( p = 0.005 ) , but when broken down by type of contraception used , no difference was seen .
for those for whom information was available , 76 % of cases were pre - menopausal ; the distribution between menopausal statuses did not differ significantly for cases and controls .
however , average age at menopause was 1.25 years lower for cases than for controls .
table 3 shows information on breastfeeding characteristics of the study population .
among parous women , no significant differences were seen between cases and controls regarding the number of those who breastfed all of their children or who breastfed at least one child .
however , significant differences were seen in the history of always using both breasts in feeding , with significantly lower rates among cases ( 51 %) than controls ( 83 %) ; p = 0.0019 .
cases were less likely to wear a bra ( 78 %) than controls ( 90 %) ; p = 0.071 .
table 4 depicts information on the characteristics of the breast problems experienced by subjects in the study .
average age at breast problem was 35.44 for cases and 35.70 for controls .
cases were more likely to experience their breast problem in the left breast ( 55 %) than the right breast ( 34 %) ; however , this information was reported for too few of the cases for the finding to be significant .
the majority of the cases were granulomatous mastitis ( n = 37 , 43.5 %) , one of the types of chronic mastitis included .
in terms of temporal proximity to lactation ( defined as problem within 6 months of lactation ) , no significant differences were seen between cases and controls ; however , information was missing for the majority of both cases and controls .
the main symptom of the breast problem was most likely to be swelling for both cases ( 40.0 %) and controls ( 74.6 %) , but cases were more likely to report abscess , secretions , and redness .
treatment administered to cases was most likely to be antibiotics or radiation ; controls reported other treatments or radiation as most common .
too little clinical information was reported for these differences to be significant .
results from the adjusted bivariate analysis and fully adjusted logistic regression model , completing postimputation , are shown in table 5 .
the bivariate analysis found 10 variables to be significant : 9 of these were included in the fully adjusted model after stepwise addition .
in the multivariate analysis , several potentially important predictors were found to be significantly associated with an outcome of cm. parity was significantly associated with an outcome of cm ; cases experienced a 75 % increase in odds of each additional birth .
cases were more likely to have a history of contraception use ( or = 2.73 , 2.07 - 3.61 ) , but this significance could not be related to type of contraception .
postmenopausal status was found to be protective against chronic mastitis when compared to premenopausal status ( or = 0.62 , 0.49 - 0.79 ) .
a case of cm was 3.76 times more likely to have breastfed all of her children than a control , and cases who breastfed were 4.40 times more likely to have not alternated breasts when breastfeeding .
cases wore a bra less often than controls ( or = 0.56 , 0.47 - 0.67 ) .
temporal proximity of problem to pregnancy and lactation was also found to be significant in the final model , with cases being 67 % more likely than controls to have experienced their breast problem during pregnancy , lactation , or within 6 months after lactation .
a woman with cm was found to have 0.71 times lower odds of maintaining employment outside home than a control subject .
additionally , variables associated with reporting mice in the study subject 's neighborhood or household were found to be risk factors ; cases had a 47 % increase in odds of reporting a campaign to control mice in their neighborhoods and a 63 % increase in odds of reporting attempts to control mice in their households .
interactions between parity and contraception were found to be significant ; likewise , the effect of whether or not a woman breastfed all of her children varied across levels of parity .
both effects were less than additive ( or = 0.86 , 0.80 - 0.93 , and or = 0.80 , 0.73 - 0.87 , resp. ) , with the effect of breastfeeding all children decreasing with each additional birth .
use of only one breast as a risk factor appeared to have a significant interaction with whether or not the breast problem was associated with lactation ( or = 0.32 , 0.22 - 0.46 ) .
4. discussion previous studies have suggested risk factors for cm involving parity , breastfeeding habits , contraception use , socioeconomic status , and treatment patterns ; however , ours is the first study to present statistically significant findings [ 3 , 17 , 22 ] .
our results indicate that the strongest measured risk factors for cm are breastfeeding all children and not alternating breasts when breastfeeding .
these risks match observations made by clinicians and reported in published case - series [ 3 , 4 , 17 ] .
several additional factors in this study appear to be associated with chronic mastitis , including premenopausal status , employment , higher parity , use of contraceptives , not wearing a bra , and reporting mice in one 's household .
some of these coincide with factors that have been previously identified as potential risk factors , and all can potentially lead to hypothesis - based testing for mechanisms of etiology .
history of contraception has been suggested in previous studies as a potential risk factor [ 4 , 7 , 11 , 22 ] .
in our study , any history of contraceptive use was found to be statistically more common in cases than controls , adding evidence to the importance of contraceptive use as a risk factor for cm. however , individual types of contraceptives could not be associated with case outcome , indicating that further research should be done to establish risk behavior .
suspected associations with pregnancy have been reported previously in case - series [ 3 , 4 , 7 , 11 , 14 , 17 ] .
even after controlling for breastfeeding , parity was associated with cm in our study , indicating that it has a statistical significance outside its relation to breastfeeding .
interactions between parity and any history of contraception were found to be significant , indicating that the effect of history of contraception use varied across levels of parity .
specifically , the effects of parity and contraception were less than additive ( or = 0.86 ) .
this indicates that there is only so much explanatory power that can be attributed to contraception with each increasing birth - - for each additional child that a woman has , the added importance of history of contraception use decreases .
this concept of less - than - additive interaction is illustrated in figure 2 ( a ) .
breastfeeding has previously been correlated with cm in several case - series [ 4 , 7 , 17 , 22 ] ; however , in another study , no association was found [ 13 ] .
in our study , breastfeeding all children was found to be very significant in the full model , accounting for the significance of breastfeeding at least one child .
this finding is probably related to the fact that cases were more likely than controls to experience their breast problem during or within 6 months after lactation , although it was independently significant .
however , this strong effect of breastfeeding all children decreases with increasing parity , as the interaction between parity and breastfeeding all children is less than additive ( or = 0.80 , figure 2 ( b )) .
the association of breastfeeding all children is seen to decrease with each additional birth , tempering the effect of breastfeeding all children in the presence of high parity .
further research is needed to understand the mechanism of this effect .
one of the main expected risk factors , as communicated by clinicians and reported in the literature , is the failure to alternate between breasts when breastfeeding [ 12 ] .
this practice was found to be highly significant as a predictor of cm in our study .
however , among those with a problem during lactation , the importance of using both breasts or not breastfeeding at all decreases in explaining case status .
this interaction indicates that the present study cannot separate cause and effect - - whether a woman experiences a problem because she is breastfeeding from only one breast or whether she breastfeeds in this pattern due to a breast problem .
this problem has been described elsewhere , in the use of mastitis - related terms such as " milk stasis ," " retention ," " obstruction ," or " breast engorgement ," since these processes are considered as both predisposing factors and direct consequences of the disease [ 23 ] .
nearly all published reports [ 1 - 4 , 11 - 14 ] on cm find that the average age of women at presentation is in their fourth decade .
our study likewise found the average age at presentation to be 35 years .
additionally , menopausal status was also found to be significant in the final model , with postmenopausal status seen to be protective .
this finding correlates with the view of cm as a reproductive - age problem often associated with pregnancy and lactation .
other protective factors seen in this study include being employed outside home and wearing a bra , both of which could potentially be related to higher socioeconomic status .
these associations have not been previously reported in the literature .
we included the condition of having mice in one 's household on the basis of a hypothesis relating mouse mammary tumor virus ( mmtv ) to breast cancer [ 24 ] .
the results from the modeling of this variable indicate that there may be a dose - response relationship with the odds of case status increase .
therefore , exposure to mice may be related to an important risk factor for disease .
however , the relationship to mice could also indicate lower socioeconomic status of cases , which is unlikely .
while presentation and treatment were not included in the final predictive models , due to temporal occurrence after presentation with disease , differences in presentation and treatment between cases and controls were seen .
the main symptom of the breast problem was most likely to be swelling for both cases and controls , but cases were more likely to report abscess , secretions , and redness .
this fits within descriptions of cm in the literature .
treatment administered to cases was most likely to be antibiotics or radiation ; controls reported other treatments or radiation as most common. from the published literature , the optimal treatment of cm is still unclear [ 18 , 25 ] .
reported case - series have described treatment with antibiotics , steroids , abscess drainage , wide surgical resection , and even mastectomy , with variable results [ 2 , 25 - 30 ] .
there are currently insufficient data to make definitive recommendations , but conservative treatment with steroids and surgery only if necessary is generally agreed upon , following the exclusion of infection [ 1 , 2 , 11 , 25 ] .
successful treatment with prednisolone , methotrexate , and azathioprine has been reported [ 13 , 25 - 29 ] .
antibiotics should only be used in the treatment of cm if a bacterial infection is identified [ 1 ] , despite the prevalent use of antibiotics seen in this study and reported elsewhere [ 6 ] .
no information was available on the identification of infection before prescription of antibiotics .
in the presence of abscess , drainage is the first choice of treatment [ 1 ] .
data and prior studies on cm are extremely limited ; however , when compared with the previously published associations , our results reveal similar findings .
the majority of published papers and case reports have come from the developing countries , which has been hypothesized to be due to lower prevalence of cm in the developed countries , overdiagnosis in the developing countries , or underdiagnosis of tuberculosis mastitis in the developing countries [ 3 , 7 ] .
additionally , this differential in reporting could reflect true differences in risk factors worldwide .
a preponderance of reports have been documented as coming from mediterranean countries and asia [ 12 ] .
a study in the usa found that hispanic women had 12 times the risk of cm as non - hispanic women [ 17 ] , and a study in the uk found that women with cm were significantly less likely to be caucasian [ 14 ] .
this indicates that the disease may be more common in minority or developing - country settings , an idea that correlates with our findings in morocco and egypt .
the study has a limitation .
among those for whom medical records were available , many did not have working contact information .
however , response rates were high among those we were able to contact .
conclusions drawn from this study therefore require an assumption of nondifferential missingness patterns between cases and controls , along with an assumption that those who could be contacted were a representative sample of all cases and controls .
the case definition used in this study was wider than that commonly used to study cm , as the vast majority of the published literature studies specific types of cm. due to the rarity of the disease and the commonalities in presentation and treatment , as well as a general lack of knowledge , we felt that it was appropriate to study these conditions together .
while recall bias is often a concern in case - control studies , the fact that both our case and control populations experienced past breast disease potentially mitigates this concern .
there is still some temporal ambiguity ; however , many of the potential risk factors surround pregnancy and lactation , and dates of pregnancy were known , eliminating some ambiguity .
despite these limitations , this study is a landmark picture of the epidemiology of cm. clinical observations long reported in the literature but never studied broadly now have statistical significance , opening the way for future studies .
chronic mastitis is a rare inflammatory disease of the breast .
little is known about the etiology or risk factors for the disease .
because studies on risks , etiologies , and treatments are lacking , women experiencing cm are often incorrectly treated .
despite its relatively severe presentation and lack of standard treatment protocol , we are unaware of any controlled analytic studies modeling risk factors for cm to date .
therefore , we believe that we have conducted the largest case - control study of cm in the literature , investigating the epidemiology and potential risk factors for the disease .
our findings indicate that the disease typically occurs in the fourth decade of life and has a statistically significant association with pregnancy / parity , lactation , breastfeeding patterns , menopausal status , employment status , history of use of contraception , having mice in one 's household , and not wearing a bra .
particularly strong associations were found between cm and breastfeeding patterns and cm and parity .
these data provide the first comprehensive statistical analysis of potential risk factors for cm. further studies are required to parse out understandings of mechanisms , establish temporality , and further understand risks and etiologies of chronic mastitis .
conflict of interests the authors declare that they have no conflict of interests .

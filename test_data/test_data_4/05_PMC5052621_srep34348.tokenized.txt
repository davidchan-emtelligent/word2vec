perceiving nano - inspired interface functionalities from their rough morphologies , we demonstrate interface - induced liquid refreshing is essential to improve heat transfer by intrinsically avoiding leidenfrost phenomenon .
high liquid accessibility of hemi - wicking and catalytic nucleation , triggered by the morphological and hydrodynamic peculiarities of nano - inspired interfaces , contribute to the critical heat flux ( chf ) and the heat transfer coefficient ( htc ) .
our experiments show chf is a function of universal hydrodynamic characteristics involving interfacial liquid accessibility and htc is improved with a higher probability of smaller nuclei with less superheat .
considering the interface - induced and bulk liquid accessibility at boiling , we discuss functionalizing the interactivity between an interface and a counteracting fluid seeking to create a novel interface , a so - called smart interface , for a breakthrough in boiling and its pragmatic application in energy systems .
economic growth and technological advancement have relied on the availability of efficient , cost - effective , sustainable energy ; indeed , the development of sustainable energy sources continues to be pressing issue for humankind1 .
various engineering approaches have attempted to enhance the efficiency of existing power generation systems based on fossil fuel and nuclear fission plant ; the issue has also triggered research into a challenging nuclear fusion plant as an alternative and ultimate energy source .
taking into account principal rules in thermodynamics , however , higher operating temperature conditions are essential for achieving higher efficiency in the thermodynamic cycle of most gas - turbine systems .
moreover , nuclear fusion requires high - temperature plasmas , resulting in significant thermal loads of over a few megawatts per square meter in a tokamak system .
thus , there is a need for technology breakthroughs for highly efficient thermal energy transfer schemes and subsequent high technology for cooling .
convection in heat and mass transfer , defined in terms of the energy transfer via the movement of groups or aggregates of molecules within a fluid , is widely used to describe various cooling and thermal energy transfer processes due to its efficiency and applicability .
as a pragmatic convection scheme , boiling heat transfer may be a promising solution to technical demands due to its outstanding heat / energy transfer ability2 .
a goal in boiling research is to maximize this ability , which can be specifically indicated by the allowable heat dissipation capacity ( i.e. , the critical heat flux , chf ) and the heat dissipation efficiency ( i.e. , the heat transfer coefficient , htc ) .
boiling is a thermo - fluidic phenomenon accompanying the heterogeneous phase change of a working fluid on a surface and multiphase flow , involving cascading ebullition and , subsequently , intricate convective behavior34 .
on these phenomenological grounds , which reach back to the historic discovery of leidenfrost in 17565 , boiling performance is governed primarily by the hydrodynamic balance between vaporization and the counteracting liquid accessibility at a heat - dissipating hot surface .
thus , the major research streams for boiling enhancement have pursued how to manipulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a working fluid and to functionalize interface - inspired characteristics with respect to interfacial hydrodynamic interactivity67 .
figure 1 shows schematically the principal factors in the bulk and interface - inspired hydrodynamic aspects and subsequent boiling characteristic curves .
the bulk fluidic accessibility is related to the hydrodynamic balance between vapor and counteracting liquid , and the interface - inspired accessibility is explained with morphology - induced interfacial effects involving static and dynamic wetting8 .
novel nano / material technologies for nano - inspired functional interfaces have triggered a possible leap in boiling research , due to their unique characteristics910 ; these features originate from the intrinsic functionality of extremely rough morphologies and associated fluidic interactivity11121314 .
extremely high surface roughness , via nanoscale structures , such as vertically aligned nanowires10141516 and micro / nano - hierarchical structures1317 , greatly expand the interfacial contact area , allowing greater heat dissipation than macroscale structures do. additionally , surface roughness accompanies the intensification of hydrophilicity , towards a superhydrophilic regime , which is clearly favorable to wetting or refreshing of the interface by a liquid - phase working fluid .
although boiling performance has been improved markedly by the use of novel nanomaterial technologies , there are unresolved issues regarding chf212 .
what are the direct grounds for the recent breakthroughs in enhancing chf using nano - inspired surfaces ?
can we suggest a plausible and universal chf model predicting the chf as a physical function of the design variables of the interfacial surfaces ?
in particular , previous approaches primarily considered the two factors of surface roughness and static wetting characteristics , which are not independent factors but tied up each other .
the factors were unable to provide a plausible physical demonstration revealing peculiar contributions of nanoscale structures to boiling enhancement101218 .
this raises questions as to whether the principal factors considered so far are indeed independent and whether other as - yet undiscovered factors may explain the phenomenon .
in considering this , we bring up an additional peculiarity from nano - inspired functionality : that is , the interfacial hydrodynamics regarding dynamic wetting by morphologically driven hemi - wicking21519202122 .
beyond intuitive concepts regarding surface roughness and static wettability , morphologically driven hemi - wicking , which can be an integrative index of the intuitive features , has proven to be a governing factor determining the interfacial hydrodynamic status1519202122 .
in this study , we provide a plausible answer to the question as to whether interfacial hemi - wicking is an appropriate factor describing the peculiar role of nano - inspired surfaces and suggest a prerequisite for a future boiling technique .
we confirm that the initiation of hemi - wicking , which must be differentiated from unconditional surface roughening , contributes greatly to the enhancement of chf by reinforcing interfacial re - wetting21223 .
moreover , the causative nano - inspired functionality , which especially accompanies apparent superhydrophilicity , leads to an increase in htc by catalyzing heterogeneous nucleation , due to the higher probability of smaller nuclei with less wall superheat demanded .
for the demonstration of separate role of intrinsic liquid accessibility and morphologically - driven accessibility , we use a surfactant in order to strengthen bulk spreading of fluid on nano - treated surfaces .
we demonstrate the independent impacts of interface - induced and bulk liquid accessibilities on boiling and examine their superpositioning effects for heat dissipation performance and their limitations .
bulk fluidic accessibility is controlled by the surface tension sigma of the working fluid ( here , deionized ( di ) water ) without affecting other bulk properties using a surfactant additive ( fs - 3100 , dupont ) .
local heal transfer characteristics are evaluated by a sensor ( fig. 2 ( a,b )) devised with different type of in situ nanostructures of vertically aligned silicon nanowires ( sinws , fig. 2 ( c,d )) and silicon nanopillars ( sinps , fig. 2 ( e - h )) .
the local temperature measuring sensors are just below the heating area ( 1 x 0.5 cm2 ) and an indium tin oxide layer is for a thin film heater .
randomly dispersed sinws and regular sinps are confined by a universal factor of the solid fraction ( phi ) defining morphology , which remains dry when the structures contact a liquid droplet .
( see methods section and supplementary information for material preparations , experimental procedure and data reduction ) .
results and discussion chf convective boiling behavior is explained by a fluidic aspect characterizing the phase change of a fluid and sequential multiphase flow48 .
figure 3 ( a ) shows typical behavior in terms of the fluidic resistance and hydrodynamic stability between up - flowing vapor columns and counteracting down - flowing liquids towards the boiling surface6724 .
when stability cannot be maintained , resulting in a lack of refreshing liquids , devastating performance degradation and critical surface burnout will eventually occur due to a vapor blanket on the surface .
here , the surface tension of a bulk fluid is an important parameter affecting liquid accessibility and subsequent convective fluidic behaviors25 .
thus , it is desirable to establish a quantitative relationship between the depression in liquid surface tension and the increase in the rate of heat transfer in the nucleation boiling regime2627 .
however , nano - inspired interfaces can trigger peculiar near - surface hydrodynamic behavior ( i.e. , hemi - wicking ) inducing morphology - induced liquid refreshing against vaporization just above a solid - liquid interface , as described in fig. 3 ( b ) .
as it is already classified by previous study8 , roughness and its impact on dynamic wetting of the hemi - wicking , which are not highlighted by bulk so - called far - field hydrodynamic mechanisms , can be covered by a near - surface mechanism31213182829 .
figure 4 shows boiling curves that are dependent on the bulk and the interface - induced liquid accessibilities , according to the variation in surface tension of the working fluid and the application of interfacial hemi - wicking , respectively .
chf occurs when the liquid cannot be sufficiently refreshed to maintain a balance against vigorous vaporization at a boiling site .
thus , chf can be characterized in terms of hydrodynamic performance .
the liquid accessibility against vaporization of a working fluid can be intrinsically forced by lowering its surface tension to be favorable for convective boiling303132 .
however , excessive depression of surface tension over a critical point of additive concentration ( i.e. , the critical micelle point ) can cause convective boiling performance to deteriorate because a further increase in additive materials , lowering sigma , causes an increase in viscosity , which paradoxically hinders liquid accessibility towards a boiling surface262730313233 .
this indicates the presence of an optimal condition for the manipulation of the bulk accessibility , presented in fig. 4 as parabolic asymptotic distributions of chfs with variation of concentration on a plain surface .
however , hemi - wicking , driven by morphology manipulation , can reinforce liquid refreshing of heterogeneous boiling interfaces ; as a factor characterizing the near - field hydrodynamic status on solid - liquid interfaces , it directly contributes to the enhancement of chf .
its impact can be seen in fig. 4 as a chf increase , by more than 100 % , on a wicking - inducing surface versus non - wicking conditions on a plain surface1234 .
considering the two hydrodynamic aspects , we demonstrate a theoretical chf model based on hydrodynamic instability between upward vapor columns and downward liquid flow ( fig. 3 ( a )) and interfacial liquid refreshing by hemi - wicking ( fig. 3 ( b )) 12 .
especially for defining the interfacial liquid refreshing via an interface manipulation , we attempt to formulate a model with a universal variable of the solid fraction ( phi ) .
the stability from bulk hydrodynamics should be guaranteed by balancing the down - flowing liquid and up - flowing vapor columns .
when the helmholtz instability of vapor columns leaving the surface distorts and blocks liquid accessibility to a boiling surface , critical heat dissipation will be attained3536 .
as vaporization continues , the surface becomes deprived of liquid refreshing and an insulating vapor layer impedes heat dissipation by covering the surface .
based on helmholtz stability , the allowed maximum heat dissipation capacity within a stable regime can be defined as the chf () 837 , and it can be postulated by considering the available gravitational energy to drive liquid into the boiling surface , resulting from the body force and the static wetting characteristics of the surface29 : where l , rho , theta , and g are the latent heat of vaporization , density , ca on a boiling surface , and gravitational acceleration , respectively .
the subscripts v and l indicate the vapor and liquid phases , respectively .
the upward bubble column should be regarded with helmholtz stability against downward liquid accessibility , and the characteristic length of the bubble column can be substituted by the rayleigh - taylor wavelength , lambdart , which defines the critical distance of a stable interface between two fluids of different densities ( here , up - flowing vapor and down - flowing liquid , fig. 3 ( a )) 243839 .
the rayleigh - taylor wavelength is given as 2pi ( sigma /( g ( rhol - rhov ))) 1 / 2 for the most critical cases in boiling analysis242940 .
taking into account interface - induced hydrodynamics , we can build a supplementary model , which reflects the interfacial dynamic re - wetting and consequent heterogeneous phase change .
the driving force of interfacial liquid refreshing is morphologically induced hemi - wicking ; thus , we can deduce the refreshing rate of a liquid , i.e. , its wickability , w4142 .
( see supplementary information for characterization of the wickability. ) here , the volumetric refreshing rate of a porous interface filled by hemi - wicking is expressed as h. ( 1 - phi ) w2 with the geometrical variables of the height of the employed interfacial structures ( h ) and the solid fraction ( phi ) of the wicking - inducing interface .
the total amount of heat dissipation by interfacial re - wetting and the sequential phase - change () is then specified for the near - field .
then the critical amount of subsequent heat dissipation can be estimated by adopting the prerequisite stable boiling area with the critical characteristic length of lambdart as follows12 : where the shape factor c1 is a correlating coefficient with regard to h , defined as the specific wicking space12 .
herein , we assume that the hydrodynamic refreshment is uniform on a confined area ( lambdart2 ) preventing a local gradients that may occur due to the size effects4344 .
this converging approach predicting chf () on a blend of the bulk and the interface - induced hydrodynamics is consistent with experimental results12 .
if we can define surface status with a framed value of the solid fraction , as shown in fig. 5 , it can be a universal one which enables to cover various types of interfacial structures. from the demonstration , we find that morphological design variable phi and the sequential capillary momentum of wickability over a manipulated interface are the principal factors determining the chf .
this model shows that hemi - wicking may be an unrevealed clue2 , providing a plausible physical demonstration of the peculiar contributions of nanoscale structures and a possibility to be a universal model covering the advantages obtainable from various types of nanostructures to boiling enhancement .
interfacial hemi - wicking is generated by the morphology - induced capillary pressure on the roughened surfaces and the consequential stronger interfacial refreshing leads to a greater liquid supply directly to the boiling surface .
on this basis , it explains that the amount of critical heat dissipation can be increased by reinforcing capillary flow momentum through a structured forest , as well as by decreasing counteracting fluidic resistance with a lower phi12224142 .
considering these aspects of boiling surface design , wickability ( w ) , subordinate to a universal factor of the solid fraction ( phi ) defining interface characteristics15 , can be decisive for the plausible extension of chf according to the suggested model .
htc this peculiarity of nano - inspired functionality can also be highlighted in convective heat dissipation efficiency in boiling .
as a heat / mass transfer mechanism , boiling heat dissipation is governed thoroughly by ebullition behavior : nucleation , growth , release , and mixing of the two phase fluids .
liquid accessibility is also a significant factor characterizing ebullition on a heterogeneous liquid - solid interface .
liquid accessibility can be manipulated passively by controlling surface tension , because lowering the surface tension of a bulk fluid leads to a weaker cohesive force between molecules and , consequently , favors accessibility to a boiling surface7 .
this tangible property of a liquid affects embryo evolution into bubble nucleation .
for the range of active nucleation sites , vapor nuclei should form with an elevated pressure , higher than that of the surrounding liquid .
the pressure difference between the nuclei and surrounding liquid is explained by the young - laplace equation ( incrementp = 2sigma / rb , where rb is a bubble radius ) , and the pressure elevation can be obtained by superheat , which is a thermal energy source that results in a temperature gradient in a hypothetical thermal boundary layer on a boiling surface4546 .
in the presence of superheat and the consequent temperature gradient across the layer , the range of active nucleation cavities rc can be given as a function of the wall superheat by4546 : where deltat , tsat , and incrementtw are the thermal boundary layer thickness , saturation temperature of the liquid , and wall superheat , respectively .
the two terms d1 and d2 reflect the hydrostatic wetting characteristics of the surface .
the effective cavity radius reff can be defined as the minimum wall superheat ( incrementtw , min ) condition that meets the criterion for nucleation initiation , which can be expressed as reff = rc ( sigma , theta , incrementtw , min ) .
the decrease in reff is attributable to the lowering of the liquid surface tension , as shown in fig. 6 , for both surfaces with and without hemi - wicking .
on interfaces with and without hemi - wicking , reinforcing direct liquid accessibility by lowering sigma attenuates the effective cavities .
according to this approach , we can further demonstrate its impact on convective heat dissipation and heat transfer stability1114 .
small nuclei can be dispersed evenly on a roughened heating surface910 , and a liquid with lower sigma can readily access a boiling surface through the secured vacant space between restrained - nuclei ; small nuclei can be released more readily and more rapidly , which will consequently lead to enhanced convective heat transfer .
it has been demonstrated that convective heat dissipation is more stable and effective with small nuclei than with large bubble formation , because the latter retards the ebullition process from nucleation to release and causes straightforward aggregation into an insulating vapor - film layer1126273233 .
as shown in the inset of fig. 6 , highly accessible liquids reinforced by passive sigma lowering via higher surfactant concentration are thus effective in stabilizing temporal wall temperature fluctuations ( i.e. , tstd , the standard deviation of transient wall temperature variations ) during nucleation .
in the nucleate boiling regime , we confirm that local surface temperature was more stable with attenuated temperature fluctuation by improving liquid accessibility through bulk hydrodynamic aspects even on the nano - treated surfaces. from lowering the surface tension on an untreated surface without any effects of nano - inspired functionality , a dramatic superheat decrease was observed as a left - shifting of the boiling curves ( fig. 4 ) .
however , wall superheat variations were insensitive to nano - inspired surfaces .
this different influence of passive liquid feeding from the lowered surface tension of a fluid is more evident if the experimental results are expressed as a plot of htcs. from fig. 7 , the differential convective boiling characteristics can be found according to the superpositioning of the two strategies : passive ( bulk ) liquid feeding by lowering surface tension of a fluid and interfacial liquid refreshing by morphologically - induced hemi - wicking .
although the absolute htcs are improved by lowering sigma in every case without regard to the presence of hemi - wicking ( inset of fig. 7 ) , the enhancement ratio of htci / htcdi ( subscripts i and di indicate the sigma - manipulated cases via a surfactant and di water , respectively ) weakens comparatively on a surface with hemi - wicking than without hemi - wicking by lowering the surface tension .
this can be demonstrated based on the degree of reff variation ( fig. 6 ) according to lowering sigma ( from 59.0 to 16.0 mn / m ) : specifically , a decrease by 4.0 mum on a plain surface without hemi - wicking and by 0.41 mum with hemi - wicking , an order of magnitude difference .
the near - field interfacial liquid accessibility by hemi - wicking is also feasible for making nucleation effective before bulk liquid feeding , by lowering sigma47 .
because the hemi - wicking surface initially confines reff to 0.88 mum due to subsequent superhydrophilic characteristics with a ca below 8.9degrees , it significantly cancels out the direct effects of lowered surface tension on reff attenuation .
the weakening of the enhancement ratio , when we directly reinforce bulk liquid accessibility , can also be demonstrated intuitively with the wall superheat characteristic and its impact on local marangoni flow .
nucleated bubbles themselves act as a thermal insulating layer , with a lower thermal conductivity of 0.016 w / m.k , resulting in a considerable wall superheat increase during the nucleate boiling process .
however as discussed previously , superhydrophilic characteristics accompanied by hemi - wicking generate predominantly small nuclei ebullition11 , which constrains the effect of sigma - dependent nuclei attenuation .
consequently , there is a diminished influence of sigma on the reduction of wall superheat , which translates into a reduction in temperature deviation between the boiling surface and a saturated bulk fluid .
this indicates that marangoni flow induced by local temperature gradient around the nuclei should be attenuated , when we superpose the two strategies for liquid accessibility .
in the case of upward surface and wall - heating conditions , upward liquid flows around the nucleated bubble generated by the thermal marangoni force ( fig. 8 ) , proportional to ( dsigma / dt ). incrementtw , which is caused by a surface tension differential along the bubble interface .
this marangoni flow originally prohibits the growth and detachment of nucleated bubbles , resulting in a flow opposite to the thermocapillary convection for an upward facing heater against buoyancy484950 .
regarding boiling performance , the marangoni force is known to be an undervalued force , because there is a dominant buoyancy acting on nucleating bubbles in a gravitational environment48495051 .
however , small bubbles , of the order of a few tens of microns , can be dominated significantly by the marangoni effect because the gravitational force is comparatively dominant for larger bubbles52 .
thus , we speculate that the marangoni effect can contribute to convective boiling with small nucleation sites resulting from sigma lowering .
the sequential dramatic wall superheat decrease can significantly attenuate the detrimental marangoni force on a surface without dominant hemi - wicking effects .
however , on a nano - inspired surface with hemi - wicking , the degree of marangoni attenuation must be less dependent on sigma lowering than on a non - wicking surface due to insensitivity to the shrinkage of nuclei ( as discussed in fig. 6 ) and subsequent lower variation in wall superheat , resulting in a temperature gradient along the nuclei .
thus , the improvement of htci / htcdi can be weakened when we superpose the two strategies of enhancing bulk liquid accessibility and using near - field interfacial liquid refreshing by hemi - wicking .
conclusions enhancement of boiling , a powerful and feasible heat - and energy - transferring technology , is a challenging issue for the development of higher - efficiency and next - generation energy systems .
perceiving the peculiarities of nano - inspired interfaces and their functionalities , we demonstrated the independent and synergetic impact of interface - induced liquid accessibility via nanostructures on boiling enhancement and examined the combined effect with bulk liquid accessibility controlled by a surfactant .
the role of interfacial hemi - wicking , a hydrodynamic functionality inspired by nanostructures , can be a plausible clue to answering remaining questions related to chf improvement .
the chf on nano - inspired surfaces could be well predictable as a function of the characteristics of the intrinsic morphology and corresponding wickability .
differing from unconditional surface roughening , morphologically driven hemi - wicking can lead to dramatic chf enhancement even with passive liquid accessibility reinforcement by lowering the surface tension of a working fluid .
moreover , the strategies of surface roughening for interfacial hemi - wicking and surface tension control for passive liquid supply were separately and simultaneously beneficial for the decrease in wall superheat .
in particular , there was a unique behavior whereby comparative htc enhancement was attenuated when we superposed far - field liquid feeding with interfacial liquid refreshing with superhydrophilicity due to the difference in effective cavity size reduction and its consequent impact on wall superheat variation .
manipulations of the hydrodynamics as a strategy for possible further improvement of liquid accessibility can be a promising approach for enhancement .
as such , novel nano - and material technologies can be adopted to provide the required interfacial functionality , a so - called smart interface , for breakthroughs in boiling performance and their application in various heat - and energy - transferring systems .
methods local temperature sensor with in situ nanostructures the devised local temperature sensor ( fig. 2 ( a,b )) consisted of five sets of four - wire resistance temperature detectors ( rtds ) , a thin film heater , and nanostructures synthesized in situ on the bare surface of the sensor1112 .
the sensor was fabricated on a 500 - mum - thick p - type silicon substrate ( boron - doped , ( 100 ) orientation , 1 - 10 omega.cm resistivity ) .
the substrate was cleaned in piranha solution ( 3:1 mixture of h2so4 and h2o2 by volume ) for 40 min and was further sequentially cleaned with acetone and methanol for 5 min each using a sonicator .
after cleaning , serpentine - shaped platinum ( pt ) rtds with a line width of 6 mum were formed by lift - off .
an insulating oxide - nitride - oxide multilayer was deposited on the rtds .
after removal of the insulating layer from the rtd electrodes , an 800 - nm - thick indium tin oxide ( ito ) layer was deposited with sequential etching of the ito for a 0.5 x 1.0 cm2 heater formation .
gold electrodes were formed on both tips of the ito by au lift - off .
an ~ 1.5 omega difference was observed for each rtd with a 1 degreesc change .
in this study , the local wall temperature from a rtd in the center of the heating area was evaluated for boiling characterizations .
synthesis of nanostructures a silicon substrate was cleaned by sequential sonication in acetone and methanol solutions , and was further cleaned in piranha solution175354 .
to synthesize sinws , the substrate was immersed in 5 mm agno3 and 4.8 m f solution for 1 min to form a ag + coating .
after rinsing the substrate with di water , the sensor was dipped into a solution of 4.8 m hf and 0.1 m h2o2 .
the si coated by reduced ag was oxidized to sio2 , and the hf solution selectively dissolved the sio2 .
the si substrate coated by ag was then selectively etched , and the remaining portions formed vertically aligned sinws .
the reduced ag on the substrate was finally removed with nitric acid .
for sinp synthesis , we used the langmuir - blodgett method with 610 - nm - diameter polystyrene ( ps ) nanospheres ( invitrogen , usa ) and obtained a hexagonally close - packed monolayer of ps on the air - water interface12 .
the monolayer of ps nanospheres was transferred to the target si substrate by scooping it up55 .
ps nanospheres on the substrate were converted into non - close - packed ones by shaving their external surfaces with an o2 plasma , and a gold layer was deposited by e - beam evaporation .
the substrate underneath the gold layer was etched in a mixture of 5 m hf and 0.5 m h2o2 .
after etching , the gold layer and remaining ps were removed .
the characteristic lengths of sinps were controlled by the initial diameter of ps for the pitch of sinps and the diameter of the remaining ps for that of sinps .
the heights of these structures were controlled by etching time , and the sinws ( fig. 2 ( c,d )) and sinps ( fig. 2 ( e - h )) had heights of 15 mum and 2 mum , respectively , which met the corresponding hemi - wicking criteria ( see supplementary information ) .
morphology characterization morphological characteristics of the nanostructures were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) measurement and image processing .
the measurements and data reduction were conducted using field - emission sem ( fe - sem , jsm - 7001f , jeol , japan ) .
evaluation of static contact angle and hemi - wicking static cas were measured with a goniometer ( ksv cam - 200 , ksv ins. , finland ) .
droplet images were collected with a high - speed camera using a frame interval of 2 ms and a resolution of 512 x 480 pixels , and static cas were analyzed automatically with a calibrating program .
measurements were conducted using a 2.5 - mul droplet of di water , and were repeated at least seven times for averaging characteristics in each case .
for the hemi - wicking evaluation , the substrate was located on a horizontal plate , and 5 mul of di water was dropped on the substrate .
the liquid propagation was recorded with a high - speed camera ( m310 , dantec dynamic , denmark ) at 100 fps .
the displacement between the wicking - front line and droplet contact line was evaluated in a post - imaging process , and the consequent wicking coefficients , w , were evaluated by averaging eight wicking distances measured along octagonal radial lines1215 .
pool boiling experiments for boiling performance evaluation , we conducted pool boiling experiments using the devised sensor with in situ sinws or sinps .
deionized ( di ) water was used as the working fluid , and all experiments were conducted at saturation conditions under ambient pressure ( i.e. , 100 degreesc of di water at 1 atm ) .
for manipulation of bulk liquid accessibility , the surface tension characteristics of the di water were changed using a nonionic surfactant ( fs - 3100 , dupont , usa ) , which caused no significant change in physical properties except for surface tension .

figure 1 descriptions of bulk and interface - inspired hydrodynamic behaviors in boiling heat transfer and associated boiling performance .
the bulk hydrodynamic aspect is determined by liquid surface tension , sigma , and the rayleigh - taylor wavelength , lambdart , confining the characteristic distance between upward vapor columns and counteracting downward liquids , which is related to the bulk hydrodynamic balance .
otherwise , interface - induced near - field hydrodynamics can be explained with an intuitive roughness effect and its subsequent static and dynamic wetting characteristics on an interface .
here , static and dynamic wetting can be indicated by the apparent static contact angle ( ca ) and morphologically induced hemi - wicking , respectively , which affect effective nucleation sizes ( r ) .
boiling curves represent performance factors , including the critical heat flux ( chf ) , the heat transfer coefficient ( htc ) and the onset of nucleate boiling11 .

donald redelmeier and colleagues conducted a population - based case - control study of 16 - 19 - year - old males hospitalized for road trauma or appendicitis and showed that disruptive behavior disorders explained a significant amount of road trauma in this group .
background teenage male drivers contribute to a large number of serious road crashes despite low rates of driving and excellent physical health .
we examined the amount of road trauma involving teenage male youth that might be explained by prior disruptive behavior disorders ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , conduct disorder , oppositional defiant disorder ) .
methods and findings we conducted a population - based case - control study of consecutive male youth between age 16 and 19 years hospitalized for road trauma ( cases ) or appendicitis ( controls ) in ontario , canada over 7 years ( april 1 , 2002 through march 31 , 2009 ) .
using universal health care databases , we identified prior psychiatric diagnoses for each individual during the decade before admission .
overall , a total of 3,421 patients were admitted for road trauma ( cases ) and 3,812 for appendicitis ( controls ) .
a history of disruptive behavior disorders was significantly more frequent among trauma patients than controls ( 767 of 3,421 versus 664 of 3,812 ) , equal to a one - third increase in the relative risk of road trauma ( odds ratio = 1.37 , 95 % confidence interval 1.22 - 1.54 , p < 0.001 ) .
the risk was evident over a range of settings and after adjustment for measured confounders ( odds ratio 1.38 , 95 % confidence interval 1.21 - 1.56 , p < 0.001 ) .
the risk explained about one - in - 20 crashes , was apparent years before the event , extended to those who died , and persisted among those involved as pedestrians .
conclusions disruptive behavior disorders explain a significant amount of road trauma in teenage male youth .
programs addressing such disorders should be considered to prevent injuries .
please see later in the article for the editors' summary editors' summary background in the latest world health organization ( who ) global burden of disease list , road traffic crashes are currently ranked eighth but are predicted to take fourth place by 2030 ( by which time , road traffic deaths are likely to increase by more than 80 % in developing countries and to decrease by nearly 30 % in industrialized countries. ) every year , road traffic crashes kill an estimated 1.2 million people world - wide and injure or disable a further 20 - 60 million .
furthermore , the economic consequences of road traffic crashes account for about 2 % of the gross national product of the entire global economy .
90 % of road traffic deaths occur in developing countries where pedestrians , cyclists , and users of two - wheel vehicles ( scooters , motorbikes ) are the most vulnerable .
in industrialized countries , teenage male drivers are the single most risky demographic group , with an incidence of road traffic crashes of twice that of the population average .
also , male teenagers are sometimes a hazard to other road users and contribute to more fatalities in older pedestrians than older drivers .
furthermore , teenage male drivers involved in serious crashes can have ongoing health care needs but are often resistant to standard road safety advice .
why was this study done ?
previous studies have suggested that disruptive behavior disorders might contribute to the risk of road traffic crashes in male teenagers but methodological problems with these studies make these results unclear .
given the importance of this topic , authorities have called for more research into the full range of behavioral disorders and relevant populations .
this study attempted to avoid the methodological problems of previous studies and to rigorously assess whether disruptive behavior disorders predispose male teenagers to road traffic crashes .
what did the researchers do and find ?
the researchers conducted a 7 - year population - based case - control study in ontario , canada of consecutive male teenagers aged between 16 and 19 years who were admitted to a hospital due to a road traffic crash , including those who were pedestrians .
for the controls , the researchers used consecutive males in the same age range who were admitted to the same hospitals during the same time interval for acute appendicitis ( which is common and generally unrelated to traumatic injury ) .
for each participant in the study , the authors used universal health care databases in canada 's single - payer health care system to identify relevant psychiatric diagnoses ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , conduct disorder , and oppositional defiant disorder ) during the decade before admission .
during the study period , 3,421 male teenagers were admitted to hospital as the result of a road traffic crash and 3,812 male teenagers were admitted to hospital for appendicitis .
a history of disruptive behavior disorders was significantly more frequent among male teenagers admitted for road traffic crashes than controls ( 767 of 3,421 versus 664 of 3,812 ) giving an odds ratio 1.37 .
this higher risk was still present after the researchers adjusted for possible confounding factors ( such as age , social status , and home location ) and accounted for about one - in - 20 road traffic crashes , including male teenagers who had died and those involved as pedestrians .
what do these findings mean ?
the results of this study suggest that disruptive behavior disorders explain a significant amount of road traffic crashes experienced in male teenagers .
overall , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , conduct disorder , and oppositional defiant disorder are associated with about a one - third increase in the risk of a road traffic crash ( which is similar to the relative risk among individuals treated for epilepsy. ) as in previous studies in this area , some methodological problems may affect the interpretation of these findings .
as this study did not document who was " at fault ," an alternative interpretation might be that behavioral disorders impair a teenager 's ability to avoid a mishap initiated by someone else .
most importantly , the observed increase in risk as pedestrians indicates that male teenagers who abstain from driving do not escape the danger of road traffic crashes .
the researchers stress that any increased risk of road traffic crashes associated with disruptive behavior disorders in male teenagers does not justify withholding a driver 's license , especially as many such disorders can be effectively treated or , indeed , because it does not address the issue of the increased risk for those teenagers who were pedestrians .
instead , they suggest that disruptive behavior disorders could be considered as contributors to road traffic crashes - - analogous to seizure disorders and some other medical diseases .
therefore , greater attention by primary care physicians , psychiatrists , and community health workers might be helpful since interventions can perhaps reduce the risk including medical treatments and avoidance of distractions .

the world health organization has information on road traffic crashes the us national institutes of health has information about behavior disorders in children as well as uk - based kids development the ontarion ministry of transportation has information on annual roadway collisions in ontario introduction road crashes are a common cause of death , disability , and property loss throughout the world equating to around 2 % of the gross national product of the entire global economy [ 1 ] .
teenage male drivers are the single most risky demographic group , with an incidence twice the population average [ 2 ] - [ 4 ] .
teenage male drivers involved in serious crashes can also have especially devastating outcomes related to ongoing needs for health care as well as foregone future productivity [ 5 ] .
in addition , young drivers are sometimes a hazard to other road users and contribute to more fatalities in older pedestrians than older drivers themselves [ 6 ] - [ 8 ] .
unfortunately , teenage male drivers are often remarkable in risk attitudes and resistant to standard safety advice [ 9 ],[ 10 ] .
safety regulation is a countermeasure for preventing road trauma in drivers .
for example , most countries prohibit driving before age 16 y [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] .
some regions have further restrictions using graduated licensing programs that disallow young drivers from night driving , high - speed roadways , and additional hazardous settings [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] .
regulations based on age are often supplemented by restrictions related to diabetes mellitus , seizure disorders , or other medical illnesses [ 17 ] .
regulations have generally not been feasible , however , for curbing many forms of driver inattention contributing to crashes [ 18 ] .
as a consequence , road trauma is a common cause of death and disability until about age 40 y and indicates that prevailing regulations ( and self - restrictions ) are insufficient [ 19 ],[ 20 ] .
past research has suggested that disruptive behavior disorders might contribute to the risk of serious road trauma in teenage males [ 21 ] - [ 24 ] .
the evidence suggests that these disorders are frequent during childhood and adolescence , characterized by impulsivity with rule infringement , and identified in some cases of trauma [ 25 ] - [ 29 ] .
past studies , however , raise uncertainties because of small sample size , referral bias , surrogate outcomes , inadequate controls , and self - report bias [ 30 ] , .
authorities , therefore , have called for more research stressing that the full range of disorders is understudied and misunderstood [ 32 ] - [ 34 ] .
the purpose of this study was to avoid such biases and assess how much disruptive behavior disorders predispose teenage males to serious road trauma .
methods setting ontario was one of the largest canadian provinces in 2005 ( study midpoint ) and had 16,599.8 km of roadway , 246 acute care hospitals , 766 roadway fatalities , and a total population of 12,160,280 individuals ( of whom 664,865 were between age 16 and 19 y ) [ 35 ] - [ 40 ] .
in this study we used universal health care databases in canada 's single - payer health care system to conduct a population - based retrospective case - control analysis of teenagers involved in serious road trauma between april 1 , 2002 and march 31 , 2009 , representing all years available for analysis .
these databases have been validated in past medical research and prior analyses have used these databases to provide measures of relative risks , absolute risk , and attributable risk [ 41 ] - [ 43 ] .
the study was approved by the research ethics board of sunnybrook health sciences center .
patients cases were identified as consecutive males between age 16 and 19 y admitted to an acute care hospital for motor vehicle related trauma ( codes v01 to v99 ) .
controls were identified as consecutive males in the same age range admitted to the same hospitals during the same time interval for acute appendicitis ( codes k35 to k38 ) .
we chose this control condition because it was frequent , clearly coded in hospital records , generally unrelated to traumatic injury , not known to protect against other childhood disorders , and has served as a standard for other research [ 44 ] - [ 49 ] .
we excluded teenage girls from both groups to avoid simpson 's paradox ( a spurious association created by loading on a null - null position ) since this group has much lower rates of crash involvement [ 50 ],[ 51 ] .
driving we directed special attention to distinguish different patterns of road trauma .
in accord with prior research [ 52 ] , we characterized each case using four categories : driver , passenger , pedestrian , and miscellaneous .
the pedestrian category also included other vulnerable road users ( e.g. , bicyclists ) and the miscellaneous category included unusual events ( e.g. , skateboards and snowmobiles ) .
we also stratified trauma severity according to medical management by following each patient during hospitalization for surgery , critical care treatment , or death .
the available databases contained no data on crash hour , other people in the same collision , or at - fault determinations by police .
disorders we focused on selected disorders relevant to childhood , defined by the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , and associated with inattention or distraction .
the specific disorders were attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , conduct disorder , and oppositional defiant disorder ( codes 312 to 314 ) [ 53 ] - [ 56 ] .
others use the term " attention deficit related disorders ," " childhood behavioral disorder ," or " externalizing disorder " to denote these conditions since combinations are frequent , exact diagnoses are not always possible , and diagnostic criteria change over time [ 57 ] - [ 60 ] .
we did not examine internalizing disorders characterized by anxiety or excess deliberation such as social phobia , obsessive compulsive disorder , or anorexia nervosa .
ascertainment for both cases and controls , we searched outpatient database records for a decade prior to admission to identify any disruptive behavior disorder diagnosed earlier ( after age 5 y ) .
this strategy assured that ascertainment was blind to outcome status , free of reporting bias , and avoided reverse - causality artifacts [ 61 ],[ 62 ] .
this strategy also allowed us to examine complex combinations occurring together , such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder combined with substance abuse or another neuropsychiatric condition .
these methods have been validated extensively in past research in canada 's single - payer universal health insurance system and were conducted using privacy safeguards of the institute for clinical evaluative sciences in ontario [ 63 ] .
severity we used multiple measures to gauge the severity of each disorder because the available records did not contain results from psychological testing .
age at onset of the disorder was defined as the date first diagnosed by a physician .
intensity of care was defined as the mean number of physician visits per year as well as the total years of treatment for the disorder .
case complexity was also characterized by the total number of visits to a board - certified psychiatrist as well as any mention of substance abuse , learning disorders , depression , personality disorders , epilepsy , movement disorders , or mental developmental delay .
the available databases did not contain information on drug therapy , patient adherence , social services , school performance , or special resources .
validation we conducted secondary analyses to examine the robustness of our findings .
we used three separate tracer conditions to explore whether the risk associated with psychiatric disorders was distinct and not shared by other childhood illnesses ; namely , asthma ( code 493 ) , contact dermatitis ( code 692 ) , and otitis media ( codes 381 to 382 ) .
the purpose of these analyses was to check for the absence of an association where no association would be expected [ 64 ] .
in addition , we stratified patients according to their short - term medical outcomes ; namely , those patients who had a prolonged length of stay (> 7 d ) , critical care unit admission , surgical operation , or death .
the purpose of these analyses was to check how findings extended across a spectrum of increasing trauma severity .
statistics the primary analysis examined the prevalence of prior disruptive behavior disorders among cases involved in a crash compared to controls not involved in a crash using an unpaired chi - square test congruent with the case - control design [ 65 ] .
logistic regression was used to further quantify associations using odds ratios to adjust for imbalances in demographic characteristics ( age , social status , home location ) and prior neuropsychiatric diagnoses ( each coded separately ) .
logistic regression was also used to explore additional risk factors among patients positive for a prior disorder .
calculations of attributable risk and attributable fraction were conducted using population - based methods [ 66 ] .
results during the 7 - y interval a total of 3,421 emergency admissions occurred for 3,421 teenage male patients involved in road trauma over 146 hospitals and 1,445 attending physicians .
we observed no major trends over the years .
the typical patient had a mean age of 17.6 y , was a driver ( 71 % , n = 2,443 ) , and had been traveling on a public roadway ( 61 % , n = 2,070 ) .
almost all had visited a physician during the decade before hospital admission ( 98 % , n = 3,356 ) .
a large number lived in rural areas ( 29 % , n = 978 ) , crashed on a weekend ( 39 % , n = 1,334 ) , involved another vehicle ( 40 % , n = 1,368 ) , and presented in the summer ( 37 % , n = 1,277 ) .
in comparison , 3,812 control patients were admitted for acute appendicitis over the same interval and same hospitals ( table 1 ) .

a history of a prior disruptive behavior disorder was significantly more common among cases than controls ( table 2 ) .
based on the case - control design , this association was equal to a one - third increase in the risk of road trauma ( odds ratio 1.37 , 95 % confidence interval 1.22 - 1.54 , chi - square = 28 , p < 0.001 ) .
the increased trauma risk was evident for those with a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , a history of other disruptive behavior disorder , or both types of histories clustered together ( table 3 ) .
in contrast , no adverse association was observed with a history of asthma ( odds ratio 0.97 , 95 % confidence interval 0.87 - 1.07 ) .

a from univariate analysis correlating cluster with increased crash risk .
the association of disruptive behavior disorders and increased risk of trauma was consistent for patients with different characteristics ( figure 1 ) .
most subgroups overlapped the primary analysis and no subgroup showed a contrary pattern .
the increased risk was apparent in crashes that did or did not involve another vehicle and was not accentuated for crashes during weekends or summer months ( unlike crashes due to alcohol ) .
the largest increase was observed in the subgroup analysis of pedestrians that showed a doubling of risk .
multivariable analysis adjusting for demographic characteristics ( age , social status , home location ) and neuropsychiatric comorbidities showed a somewhat larger increase in the risk of road trauma associated with prior disorders ( odds ratio = 1.38 , 95 % confidence interval 1.21 - 1.56 , p < 0.001 ) .

two aspects of the patient history accentuated the observed association as independent risk factors for trauma among those with prior disruptive behavior disorders .
those in rural settings with prior disorders had double the risk of those in urban settings with no prior disorders ( odds ratio = 2.35 , 95 % confidence interval 1.83 - 3.01 ) .
similarly , those treated for five or more years had higher risks compared to those with no prior disorders ( odds ratio = 1.43 , 95 % confidence interval 1.26 - 1.63 ) .
age at first diagnosis , number of specialist visits , and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities were not particularly ominous or reassuring ( table s1 ) .
the increased risk was apparent multiple years before the crash as measured either by time from birth or time before crash ( figure 2 ) .

discussion we studied teenage male youth admitted to hospital for road trauma .
we found high rates of disruptive behavior disorders evident years before the crash .
overall , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , conduct disorder , and oppositional defiant disorder were associated with about a one - third increase in the risk of serious road trauma , which is similar in magnitude to the relative risk documented for individuals treated for epilepsy [ 67 ],[ 68 ] .
collectively , the attributable risk associated with these disorders explained about 1 - in - 20 crashes observed in this study .
these findings were prevalent throughout the years , accentuated in rural settings , evident in the most severe cases , and difficult to attribute to chance .
one limitation in our study relates to the retrospective design .
teenagers and their families are aware of diagnoses , may self - restrict driving , and thereby attenuate all observed risks [ 69 ] .
in addition , childhood psychiatric diagnoses can be mistaken and the misdiagnoses also bias our relative risk estimates toward the null [ 55 ],[ 70 ] .
for example , if diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were each 95 % , the true odds ratio would be about 2.0 rather than 1.3 .
our controls , furthermore , were not immune to psychiatric illness , so that the attributable risk estimates are also conservative .
if our study presumed a disease prevalence of 10 % from population surveys [ 71 ] , for example , the estimated odds ratio would be about 2.5 and the attributable risk would account for about 1 - in - 9 observed crashes .
another large limitation in our study is that all patients diagnosed with disruptive behavior disorders had access to care and received treatment .
because care is effective , the observed increase in risk is smaller than would occur in patients with missed diagnoses , no access to care , or poor adherence to treatment .
the canadian setting also had multimodal social services during this interval devoted to educating families of affected children , adapting school programs for special needs , curbing alcohol drinking in youth , and subsidizing medications for children in poverty [ 72 ],[ 73 ] .
if 50 % of eligible patients received treatment and 50 % of treated patients responded with positive benefits , for example , the true unmeasured baseline risk would equal an odds ratio of about 1.5 rather than 1.3 .
a third limitation that causes our study to underestimate the association of disruptive behavior disorders with road trauma is that the data excluded girls [ 74 ] .
to address this issue we retrieved the original databases , replicated our methods in girls rather than boys , and conducted a post hoc analysis .
as anticipated , the results yielded a smaller sample ( n = 4,156 ) and about the same estimated risk ( odds ratio 1.31 , 95 % confidence interval 1.07 - 1.61 , chi - square = 6.8 , p = 0.010 ) .
hence , the association of disruptive behavioral disorders with road trauma extended to both teenage boys and girls. of course , many issues remain for future research including medication level at time of injury , amount of driving , extent of brain trauma , and sequelae among those not hospitalized [ 75 ],[ 76 ] .
universal health care databases have strengths because they are the antithesis of small surveys using self - report .
the sample size is substantial and represents a 100 % response rate - - thereby avoiding referral bias , selective participation , range restrictions , and other threats to validity .
outcomes reflect serious crashes and are not extrapolations based on surrogate tests of driving risk .
ascertainment of prior diagnoses is conducted in an objective manner blind to outcomes , free of recall bias , and comprehensive over a decade .
the downside , however , is a lack of data from prospective observation of lifestyle , alcohol , drugs , speeding , distractions , impulsivity , undiagnosed internalizing disorders , and other mechanisms or mediators in the causal pathway to driver error [ 77 ] .
the increased risk of road trauma associated with disruptive behavior disorders in male youth does not by itself justify withholding a driver 's license .
many disorders can be treated effectively , so that well - managed patients could have outcomes similar to the population average [ 78 ],[ 79 ] .
this study , as well , has no at - fault data so an alternative interpretation might be that such disorders merely impair a person 's ability to avoid a mishap initiated by someone else .
our analysis could also be explained by a hidden third factor linked to both the disorder and crash risks ; for example , undocumented head injuries .
most importantly , the observed increase in risk as pedestrians indicates that those who abstain from driving do not escape the danger of serious road trauma .
the strongest argument in favor of regulations is that bad driving imposes risks on other people and can destroy whole lives in a moment .
the main rebuttal against regulations involves the reduced quality of life and increased workload for innocent individuals .
reporting by physicians of unfit drivers to vehicle licensing authorities is one policy option , particularly since the average patient in our study had multiple visits to a physician in the year before the trauma [ 80 ] .
regulations of psychiatric diagnoses , however , would be controversial given the unfair stigma and social discrimination that surrounds mental disorders [ 81 ] .
a further caveat is that disruptive behavior disorders are sometimes overdiagnosed , open to debate , and could be abused by vehicle insurers [ 82 ],[ 83 ] .
roadway engineering is a different alternative for mitigating driver error by making the environment more forgiving .
however , such well - intentioned policies sometimes lead to greater dangers for younger drivers [ 84 ] .
a classic example involves designing the approach paths to road intersections with generous sight lines to accommodate drivers with slow reaction times ( e.g. , older drivers ) .
this safety cushion , ironically , can tempt drivers who have quick reaction times to approach at faster speeds ( e.g. , younger drivers ) [ 85 ] .
as such , a policy of creating " forgiving roads " can ironically create " permissive roads " for those who are impulsive and have imperfect rule adherence .
the underlying error is that drivers sometimes overestimate their skills and underestimate their risks [ 86 ] .
the findings call attention to a widespread , preventable , and costly cause of death and disability .
specifically , disruptive behavior disorders could be considered as contributors to road trauma - - analogous to seizure disorders , refraction errors , and some other medical diseases [ 17 ] .

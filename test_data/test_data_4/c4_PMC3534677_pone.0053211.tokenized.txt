a shared characteristic of tumor cells is their exacerbated growth .
consequently , tumor cells demand high rates of phospholipid synthesis required for membrane biogenesis to support their growth .
c - fos , in addition to its ap - 1 transcription factor activity , is the only protein known up to date that is capable of activating lipid synthesis in normal and brain tumor tissue .
for this latter activity , c - fos associates to the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) through its n - terminal domain and activates phospholipid synthesis , an event that requires it basic domain ( bd ) ( aa 139 - 159 ) .
fra - 1 , another member of the fos family of proteins , is over - expressed in human breast cancer cells and its bd is highly homologous to that of c - fos with two conservative substitutions in its basic amino acids .
consequently , herein we examined if fra - 1 and / or c - fos participate in growth of breast cancer cells by activating phospholipid synthesis as found previously for c - fos in brain tumors .
we found both fra - 1 and c - fos over - expressed in > 95 % of human ductal breast carcinoma biopsies examined contrasting with the very low or undetectable levels in normal tissue .
furthermore , both proteins associate to the er and activate phospholipid synthesis in cultured mcf7 and mda - mb231 breast cancer cells and in human breast cancer samples .
stripping tumor membranes of fra - 1 and c - fos prior to assaying their lipid synthesis capacity in vitro results in non - activated lipid synthesis levels that are restored to their initial activated state by addition of fra - 1 and / or c - fos to the assays .
in mda - mb231 cells primed to proliferate , blocking fra - 1 and c - fos with neutralizing antibodies blocks lipid - synthesis activation and cells do not proliferate .
taken together , these results disclose the cytoplasmic activity of fra - 1 and c - fos as potential targets for controlling growth of breast carcinomas by decreasing the rate of membrane biogenesis required for growth .

introduction the fos and jun oncogenes are members of the family of immediate early genes ( iegs ) ap - 1 transcription factors that are rapidly and transiently expressed in different cell types in response to a myriad of stimuli , such as growth factors , neurotransmitters , etc .
[ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
the fos proteins ( c - fos , fra - 1 , fra - 2 and fos - b ) and the jun proteins ( c - jun , junb and jund ) share homologous regions containing a basic dna - binding domain ( bd ) and a leucine zipper dimerization motif .
jun proteins form homo - and heterodimers whereas fos proteins only form heterodimers with other ieg 's , mostly jun proteins , thus originating the variety of ap - 1 transcription factors that regulate target genes expression in response to growth factors [ 1 ] , [ 4 ] .
although c - fos was described as an ap - 1 transcription factor more than 20 years ago , the complex consequences of its induction on cell physiology have still not been fully elucidated .
it has been proposed that , upon mitogenic stimuli , c - fos triggers and controls cell growth , differentiation and apoptosis by regulating key genes [ 5 ] .
however , we have shown that in addition to its nuclear ap - 1 activity , c - fos associates to the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) and activates phospholipid synthesis as an additional response to mitogenic stimuli [ 6 ] .
this cytoplasmic activity of c - fos has been observed in vivo in light - stimulated retina ganglion and photoreceptor cells [ 6 ] - [ 9 ] , in culture in nih3t3 fibroblasts induced to re - enter growth [ 10 ] , in pc12 cells induced to differentiate [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , in actively growing and proliferating t98g glioblastoma multiforme - derived cells [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , and in human and mouse tumors from the peripheral and central nervous systems [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
although the mechanism by which c - fos associates to the er and activates phospholipid biosynthesis is currently not fully elucidated , it is known that c - fos physically associates with specific , key enzymes of the pathway of phospholipid synthesis in the er [ 17 ] .
c - fos / er association is regulated by the phosphorylation state of c - fos - tyrosine residues # 10 and # 30 whereas its activation capacity depends on its bd ( 20 amino acids spanning from 139 - 159 ) [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 17 ] .
the expression of fra - 1 ( the fos - related antigen - 1 ) , another member of the fos family of proteins , is encoded by the fos - like - 1 gene ( fosl1 ) is also induced by mitogenic stimuli [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] ; its role in cell growth is also not well understood .
fra - 1 - ap - 1 transcriptional activity is regulated both transcriptionally [ 20 ] - [ 22 ] and post - translationally [ 22 ] .
in exponentially growing cells , fra - 1 expression is elevated and it is hyper - phosphorylated on c - terminus ser and thr residues [ 23 ] .
these phosphorylation sites seem to play a role both in stabilizing fra - 1 and on its ap - 1 activity [ 22 ] - [ 26 ] .
in spite that the leucine zipper domain of fra - 1 is homologous to that of other fos family members , transcriptional activation studies suggest that fra - 1 is a negative regulator of ap - 1 activity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
among the fos family members , fra - 1 is probably the most frequently expressed in different forms of human cancer [ 22 ] , [ 27 ] : its over - expression has been reported in proliferative disorders such as breast , lung , colon , oesophageal , brain and thyroid cancer [ 22 ] , [ 27 ] - [ 38 ] .
fra - 1 has also been shown as a feature of hyperplastic and neoplastic breast disorders [ 31 ] - [ 33 ] with capacity to regulate proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
a positive correlation has been found between fra - 1 expression and an aggressive phenotype in breast invasive ductal carcinoma [ 34 ] .
however , most work has focused on studying the nuclear activity of fra - 1 in spite that its cytoplasmic over - expression has been reported in breast , lung and thyroid cancer [ 31 ] , [ 33 ] - [ 35 ] , [ 38 ] .
tumor cells demand high rates of phospholipid synthesis to support membrane biogenesis for their exacerbated growth .
in mice knock - out for c - fos and knock - in for fra - 1 under the c - fos promoter , fra - 1 rescues and substitutes for growth - dependent functions of c - fos but not for its ap - 1 activity [ 39 ] , suggesting that fra - 1 and c - fos may substitute each other in some of their biological functions .
herein we examined fra - 1 and c - fos expression in growing breast cancer cells and their capacity to activate phospholipid synthesis .
it is shown that both fra - 1 and c - fos are over - expressed in > 95 % of ductal breast carcinoma tissue samples contrasting with very low or undetectable levels in normal tissue .
both fra - 1 and c - fos were found associated to the er and activating phospholipid synthesis in breast cancer cells in culture and in human breast cancer tissue samples , thus disclosing this activity of these proteins as a potential target for controlling growth of breast carcinomas .

results fra - 1 and c - fos expression is up - regulated in the cytoplasm of growing beast cancer cells and both proteins co - localize with er markers fra - 1 and c - fos expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence and immunoblot in mda - mb231 and mcf7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines .
mda - mb231 are highly invasive , estrogen receptor alpha negative , e - cadherin negative and vimentin positive cells whereas mcf7 are weakly invasive , estrogen receptor alpha positive , e - cadherin positive and vimentin negative cells [ 28 ] .
in quiescent mda - mb231 ( figure 1a ) or mcf7 cells ( figure 1b ) ( - fbs : grown in the absence of fbs ) , low levels of both fra - 1 ( upper panels ) and c - fos ( lower panels ) were detected .
however , upon induction of cells to re - enter growth by feeding with fbs (+ fbs ) , a marked up - regulation of fra - 1 ( upper panel ) and c - fos ( lower panel ) expression was observed in both mda - mb231 ( a ) and mcf7 ( b ) cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0053211.g001 figure 1 mda - mb231 and mcf7 cells show abundant fra - 1 and c - fos expression , which co - localizes with the er marker calnexin .
expression of fra - 1 ( upper left columns ) , c - fos ( lower left columns ) and the er marker calnexin ( middle columns ) are shown in mda - mb231 cells ( a ) , and mcf7 cells ( b ) .
cells were immunostained for fra - 1 ( top panels , green ) or c - fos ( lower panels , green ) and for calnexin ( red ) .
the top rows of each panel show quiescent cells ( - fbs ) while those in the second row correspond to growing cells (+ fbs ) .
the last column of each panel is the merge image of the previous two columns .
yellow color evidences fra - 1 / er ( top panels ) or c - fos / er ( lower panels ) co - localization sites .
clear co - localization is evidenced for both fra - 1 and c - fos with the er marker calnexin as determined by confocal immunofluorescence analysis .
( c ) .
fra - 1 ( upper panel ) and c - fos ( lower panel ) content was determined by wb in total homogenate ( th ) and in the microsomal ( mf ) and supernatant ( sf ) fractions obtained after centrifuging mda - mb231 ( left panel ) or mcf7 ( right panel ) cells at 100,000xg for 1 h. in addition , fra - 1 and c - fos content was examined in mf and sf obtained after stripping mf with 1m kcl prior to centrifugation .
results shown are from one representative experiment out of three performed with essentially the same results .
interestingly , in growing cells , c - fos and fra - 1 were present both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm although both were more abundant in the cytoplasm .
when cells were immuno - stained for the er marker calnexin , the cytoplasmic fraction of both proteins clearly co - localized with the er marker ( figure 1 a - b , middle columns and merged images to the right ) .
this sub - cellular localization was confirmed by wb after subjecting total homogenate ( th ) from quiescent ( - fbs ) and growing cells (+ fbs ) to sub - cellular fractionation by centrifugation at 100,000xg for 1 h to isolate the microsomal ( mf ) and the supernatant ( sf ) fractions .
both mda - mb231 ( figure 1c , left panel ) and mcf7 cells ( figure 1c , right panel ) clearly showed higher fra - 1 and c - fos immuno - reactivity in total homogenate ( th ) from growing cells (+ fbs ) as compared to quiescent ( - fbs ) cells and both proteins were recovered in the mf. when the mf was stripped of its associated proteins by treatment with 1m kcl , fra - 1 and c - fos were no longer recovered in mf but rather were recovered in the sf ( figure 1c , last two lanes ) .
both fra - 1 and c - fos activate phospholipid synthesis in mda - mb231 and mcf7 cells we previously showed that the bd of c - fos ( amino acids 139 - 159 ) is required to activate phospholipid synthesis [ 11 ] , [ 17 ] .
considering that the bd of fra - 1 and c - fos are conserved showing only two conservative substitutions in their bd 's ( see schematic representation in figure 2 ) and that both proteins co - localize with the er marker calnexin , we next studied if fra - 1 , as previously described for c - fos in other cells [ 6 ] - [ 17 ] , activates phospholipid synthesis in actively growing cells .
32p - labeling of phospholipids was determined in vitro using th prepared from quiescent and growing mda - mb231 and mcf7 cells .
th and the mf of growing mda - mb231 cells (+ fbs , second column ) showed a significant increase in 32p - phospholipid labeling as compared to quiescent cells ( - fbs , first column )( figure 3a ) .
furthermore , a comparable activation of 32p - phospholipid labeling was observed when recombinant fra - 1 ( third column ) or c - fos ( fourth column ) ( 1.5 or 1.0 ng / microg of th protein , respectively ) were added to th of quiescent ( - fbs ) cells .
similarly , when the th from growing cells (+ fbs ) was stripped with 1m kcl ( thus containing negligible levels of c - fos and fra - 1 as shown in figure 1 ) , 32p - phospholipid labeling decreased markedly mirroring the levels in th from quiescent cells .
addition of recombinant fra - 1 or c - fos to these stripped membranes restored 32p - phospholipid synthesis to the initial activated levels ( last two columns ) .
similar results were observed with mcf7 cells ( figure 3b ) .
altogether , these results show that fra - 1 is capable of activating phospholipid synthesis to levels comparable to those obtained with c - fos .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0053211.g002 figure 2 schematic representations of c - fos and fra - 1 and comparison of their basic domains ( bd ) .
c - fos is a 380 amino acid ( aa ) protein whereas fra - 1 contains 271 aa. the bd of c - fos spans from aa 139 to 159 whereas that of fra - 1 spans from aa 107 to aa 127 .
comparison of both bds shows that of the 12 basic aa that each contain ( schematized in bold letters ) , these are highly homologous showing only two conservative substitutions of the basic aa that are underlined in the scheme .
c - fos contains a c - terminal trans - activating domain ( tad ) that is not present in fra - 1 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0053211.g003 figure 3 phospholipid synthesis is activated in membranes from mda - mb231 and mcf7 cells containing fra - 1 or c - fos .
mda - mb231 ( a ) and mcf7 ( b ) cells were used to prepare total homogenate ( th ) , microsomal fraction ( mf ) and the 1m kcl - stripped microsomal fraction ( mf + 1m kcl ) , as indicated under figure 2 .
these fractions and the stripped mf plus 1.5 ng of recombinant fra - 1 or 1 ng of c - fos / microg of th were assayed for phospholipid synthesis capacity .
results are the mean cpm incorporated into phospholipids / mg protein +/ - sd of 3 experiments performed in triplicate .
* : p < 0.01 .
blocking fra - 1 and c - fos abrogates phospholipid synthesis activation and cell proliferation the participation of nuclear and cytoplasmic c - fos in driving tumor cell proliferation and growth was examined in growing mda - mb231 cells cultured in the presence or the absence of an ap - 1 nuclear localization sequence peptide ( nlsp ) that blocks the nuclear import of c - fos and fra - 1 as ap - 1 dimers [ 42 ] .
figure 4a shows that after culturing cells + fbs for 36 h , cell number roughly doubled .
however , as described previously [ 14 ] , adding nlsp to the cultures at 0 or 6 h after priming cells to proliferate (+ fbs ) blocks cell proliferation , whereas at later times ( 16 h ) it is no longer effective ( column 5 ) , indicating that nuclear ap - 1 - c - fos / fra - 1 is required to trigger proliferation at early stages. by contrast , cytoplasmic c - fos and fra - 1 are required at all time points because blocking their activity with specific neutralizing antibodies delivered at any time after feeding fbs ,+ or - nlsp , specifically blocks proliferation ( figure 4a , columns 6,7,8 ) .
these results highlight the need of ap - 1 to trigger the genomic events for proliferation and growth and that of cytoplasmic fra - 1 and c - fos to activate lipid synthesis required for membrane biogenesis to sustain growth .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0053211.g004 figure 4 nuclear ap - 1 - fra - 1 / c - fos and cytoplasmic fra - 1 / c - fos are required at early and late stages of cell proliferation , respectively .
( a ) mda - mb231 cells were cultured + or - nlsp that blocks ap - 1 nuclear import , in the presence or the absence of anti - fra - 1 or anti - c - fos antibodies added at the indicated times ( 0 h or 16 h ) after fbs addition and examined for proliferation .
controls were performed that received fitc - igg antibody ( last column ) .
proliferation was determined as indicated under materials and methods and expressed as arbitrary fluorescent units of dna .
results are the mean +/ - sd of 3 experiments performed in quintuplicate ; 10,000 cells were plated for each proliferation assay .
note that nuclear import of fra - 1 / c - fos - ap - 1 is required only during the first 16 h after fbs addition whereas cytoplasmic fra - 1 / c - fos are required at all time points ( compare column 5 with columns 6,7 or 8 ) .
( b ) th form mda - mb231 cells cultured as in ( a ) were assayed for phospholipid synthesis capacity .
results are the mean cpm incorporated into phospholipids / mg protein +/ - sd of 3 experiments performed in triplicate .
* : p < 0.001 .
to confirm the importance of fra - 1 / c - fos - dependent phospholipid synthesis activation during proliferation and growth , this was assessed in fbs - stimulated mda - mb231 cells cultured + nlsp or - nlsp and transfected with c - fos and fra - 1 neutralizing antibodies at different times .
accordingly , higher rates of 32p - phospholipid labeling were detected in growing cells (+ fbs ) when compared to quiescent cells ( - fbs ) ( figure 4b ) .
feeding cells with nlsp at 0 h or 6 h after fbs priming , abrogated 32p - phospholipid labeling activation , whereas primed cells - activated levels were observed when nlsp was added at 16 h. these results further support that nuclear ap - 1 is needed to trigger the genomic events for proliferation and growth whereas cytoplasmic fra - 1 and c - fos are required to sustain growth .
taking into consideration that mda - mb231 and mcf7 cells contain both c - fos and fra - 1 , it was deemed of interest to determine if both proteins are required to support cell proliferation or if one is enough and can substitute for the other .
for this , quiescent mda - mb231 cells were transfected with sirna against c - fos or against fra - 1 or both .
at 96 h of transfection , cells were induced to proliferate by the addition of fbs to the culture medium and proliferation determined 36 h later .
figure 5a shows that proliferation of mock - transfected cells was essentially the same as that of non - transfected cells whereas transfection of sirna against either c - fos or fra - 1 partially blocked proliferation .
however , blocking the expression of both proteins completely blocks proliferation indicating that either c - fos or fra - 1 can support proliferation provided that protein expression levels are high enough. fig. 5b shows that treatment of cells with sirna effectively blocked c - fos and fra - 1 expression as determined by wb assays .

malignant human breast tumors show abundant fra - 1 and c - fos expression associated to the er and activated phospholipid synthesis considering the results described above , we analyzed fra - 1 and c - fos expression and phospholipid synthesis activation capacity in malignant human breast tumor samples .
immunohistochemistry assays revealed a marked over - expression of fra - 1 and c - fos in 100 % of 210 tissue samples from different human breast tumors [ invasive ductal carcinoma ( n = 200 ) , medullary carcinoma ( n = 2 ) , phyliodes sarcoma ( n = 2 ) , mucinous carcinoma ( n = 2 ) , lobular carcinoma in situ ( n = 2 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( n = 2 )] , contrasting with the low or undetectable levels of fra - 1 and c - fos detected in the non - pathological samples ( n = 37 ) .
noteworthy , both proteins were over - expressed in 95 % of the tumor samples analyzed , which also showed significant pcna staining which evidenced their active proliferative status .
when assessing the subcellular localization of these proteins , fra - 1 was found mainly in the cytoplasm : 69 % of tumor samples showed only cytoplasmic fra - 1 whereas the remaining tumor samples contained both nuclear and cytoplasmic - localized fra - 1 ( 31 %) .
c - fos was also preferentially present in the cytoplasm of the tumor samples : 100 % showed cytoplasmic c - fos whereas , of these , 63 % also contained nuclear c - fos .
remarkably , in all cases cytoplasmic fra - 1 and c - fos co - localized with the er marker calnexin ( figure 6a , b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0053211.g006 figure 6 human malignant breast carcinomas show abundant fra - 1 and c - fos expression co - localizing with the er marker calnexin .
expression of fra - 1 ( a ) , c - fos ( b ) , the er marker calnexin , and the nuclear marker of proliferating cells pcna was examined by triple labeling in malignant human breast tumor specimens ( n = 210 ) and non - pathological samples ( n = 37 ) .
six representative samples of invasive ductal carcinomas from a tissue array immunostained for fra - 1 ( a , green ) or c - fos ( b , green ) , calnexin ( red ) and pcna ( blue ) and three non - pathological samples ( bottom row ) are shown for each onco - protein examined .
note that all actively proliferating cells ( pcna positive cells ) show abundant fra - 1 and c - fos expression which in all cases is observed co - localizing with the er marker as evidenced by the yellow color of the merged , triple - labeled images .
figure 7a shows immunoblot experiments of 5 normal ( n1 to n5 ) and 8 tumor samples ( t1 to t8 ) randomly selected from the breast tissue collection .
fra - 1 and c - fos over - expression is clearly observed in actively proliferating tumor samples ( as evidenced by the high levels of pcna immuno - reactivity ) as compared to their non - pathological counterparts .
tubulin staining was used as a loading control ( figure 7a ) .
subjecting tumor samples 5 and 6 to subcellular fractionation and wb confirmed that fra - 1 and c - fos expression is associated to mf and that this association is reversed by 1m kcl - treatment ( figure 7b ) .

( b ) th , mf and sf obtained as described under figure 2 from tumors # 5 ( left panel ) and # 6 ( right panel ) were examined for fra - 1 and c - fos content .
in addition , fra - 1 and c - fos content was examined in mf and sf obtained after stripping mf with 1m kcl prior to centrifugation .
results shown are from one representative experiment out of three performed with essentially the same results .
fra - 1 and c - fos activate phospholipid biosynthesis in human breast tumors 32p - phospholipid labeling was assayed in vitro using fresh human breast tumor and non - pathological samples .
figure 8a shows high 32p - phospholipid labeling in th from all the tumor samples as compared to the mean value from the non - pathological samples ( figure 8a ) .
this elevated phospholipid synthesis correlates with the elevated content of c - fos / fra - 1 and the highly proliferative status of tumor cells ( figure 7a ) .
subcellular fractionation of tumors 5 and 6 confirmed that the activated - 32p - phospholipid labeling capacity was preponderantly present in mf and that this activity was abrogated when membranes were stripped with 1m kcl ( figure 7b - c , fourth columns ) .
both , fra - 1 and c - fos activate phospholipid synthesis as the addition of either fra - 1 or c - fos to these stripped membranes restores phospholipid synthesis to the initial rates observed in the untreated tumor mf ( figure 8b - c ) .
these results confirm data obtained with mda - mb231 and mcf7 cells and further support the role of fra - 1 and c - fos as activators of phospholipid synthesis to support membrane biogenesis for tumor cell growth .

discussion fra - 1 is a fos family member that is over - expressed in diverse types of human cancers including brain [ 37 ] , [ 43 ] , lung [ 44 ] , oesophagus [ 36 ] , thyroid [ 38 ] , colorectal , skin , ovary , etc .
( reviewed in [ 24 ] , [ 27 ]). of the four fos family members , fra - 1 is likely to be the most frequently expressed in different forms of human cancer [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] .
several studies have shown that fra - 1 over - expression in breast tumor cell lines is associated with an aggressive behavior of these cells [ 28 ] , [ 45 ] .
although only a few reports have addressed fra - 1 over - expression in clinical tumors , this was found in all malignant breast tissues [ 31 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
furthermore , in all these studies , nuclear and cytoplasmic fra - 1 was found although in many cases only nuclear - containing fra - 1 cells were considered as fra - 1 - positive cells [ 34 ] .
it was reasoned that only nuclear - localized fra - 1 is important due to its transcription factor function , disregarding the possibility of other functions for this protein. by contrast , song et al .
[ 31 ] found that 90.2 % of all breast carcinomas analyzed ( n = 445 ) showed nuclear and cytoplasmic fra - 1 over - expression whereas only 9.2 % of the samples ( n = 41 ) showed only nuclear fra - 1 over - expression ; of the 20 benign tumors examined , only 3 showed weak cytoplasmic immuno - reactivity that co - existed with the nuclear reactivity that was present in all samples .
however , a clear shift from nuclear to a simultaneous nuclear / cytoplasmic localization of fra - 1 was noticed in ~ 90 % of breast carcinomas examined which led them to conclude that a non - transcriptional function of fra - 1 remained to be demonstrated [ 31 ] .
we previously showed that over - expressed , cytoplasmic c - fos activates phospholipid synthesis in brain tumor cell lines and in human brain tumors thus supporting the elevated rates of membrane biogenesis required for the exacerbated growth of these tumors [ 15 ] .
to activate phospholipid synthesis , the basic domain of c - fos ( aa 139 - 160 ) is required [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
furthermore , point mutations of this conserved bd in basic amino acids # 139 or # 144 ( k139n , r144n ) has no effect on bd 's lipid synthesis activating capacity whereas that of basic amino acid # 146 ( r146n ) completely abolishes this activity further supporting the importance of bd for the activation of specific enzymes in the pathway of synthesis of lipids [ 17 ] .
consequently , considering the results described above regarding fra - 1 cytoplasmic over - expression and the fact that fra - 1 and c - fos share their basic domains , we herein addressed the possibility that fra - 1 may also activate phospholipid synthesis in growing human breast tumors .
using breast tumor cell lines and clinical tumor samples , it is demonstrated that this is indeed the case .
briefly , we found that growing mda - mb231 and mcf7 cells exhibit high rates of phospholipid biosynthesis as compared with quiescent cells .
furthermore , stripping membranes prepared from growing cells of its non - integral proteins by 1m kcl - treatment resulted in quiescent cell phospholipid synthesis rates , which was restored to its initial activated rates by the addition of recombinant fra - 1 or c - fos to the assay medium .
these results were mirrored when analyzing human breast tumor samples : phospholipid synthesis was also significantly higher in tumors as compared to normal tissue and was significantly reduced when subjecting tumor samples to 1m kcl - treatment .
addition of fra - 1 or c - fos to stripped samples restored phospholipid synthesis activation to initial rates .
finally , the previously shown dual function ( nuclear and cytoplasmic ) of c - fos ( 14,11 ) was also demonstrated for fra - 1 in experiments in which cells were fed nlsp at different times after inducing them to re - enter growth .
ap - 1 - fra - 1 and / or ap - 1 - c - fos were required to trigger proliferation only at early stages of cell proliferation .
in contrast , at later stages of cell proliferation ( 16 h after priming cells ) , cytoplasmic fra - 1 and / or c - fos ( that activate phospholipid biosynthesis ) were necessary to sustain proliferation .
blocking fra - 1 and c - fos with intracellular neutralizing antibodies abrogated both phospholipid synthesis activation and cell proliferation .
the cytoplasmic regulatory role of c - fos or fra - 1 is not the only ap - 1 independent activity of an ieg .
c - jun was also shown to protect cells from apoptosis independently of its ap - 1 activity [ 46 ] .
in addition , cytoplasmic p53 is capable of triggering apoptosis in the absence of transcription [ 47 ] whereas translocation of nuclear p21cip1 / waf1 to the cytoplasm promotes resistance to apoptotic stimuli [ 48 ] .
consequently in light of these results and of ours shown herein , a new concept is emerging in which the biological activity of these proteins results from the combination of their nuclear and cytoplasmic activities [ 49 ] .
these data may highlight the significance of therapy based on the blockade of fra - 1 and / or c - fos functions in breast cancer .
therapies directed towards blocking fra - 1 and c - fos expression are promising moreover if it is considered that these proteins are normally down - regulated in normal breast cell growth but become up - regulated during , and are causally related to , breast cancer progression .

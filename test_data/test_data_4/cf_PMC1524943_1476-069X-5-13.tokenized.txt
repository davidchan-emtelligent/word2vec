background the national institute for occupational safety and health previously reported mortality for a cohort of workers considered highly exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) between 1939 and 1977 at two electrical capacitor manufacturing plants .
the current study updated vital status , examined liver and rectal cancer mortality previously reported in excess in this cohort and evaluated mortality from non - hodgkin 's lymphoma ( nhl ) and cancers of the stomach , intestine , breast , prostate , skin ( melanoma ) and brain reported to be in excess in other cohort and case - control studies of pcb - exposed persons .
methods mortality was updated through 1998 for 2572 workers .
age - , gender - , race - and calendar year - adjusted standardized mortality ratios ( smrs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) were calculated using u.s. , state and county referent rates .
smrs using u.s. referent rates are reported .
duration of employment was used as a surrogate for exposure .
results consistent with the previous follow - up , mortality from biliary passage , liver and gall bladder cancer was significantly elevated ( 11 deaths , smr 2.11 , ci 1.05 - 3.77 ) , but mortality from rectal cancer was not ( 6 deaths , smr 1.47 , ci 0.54 - 3.21 ) .
among women , mortality from intestinal cancer ( 24 deaths , smr 1.89 , ci 1.21 - 2.82 ) and from " other diseases of the nervous system and sense organs " , which include parkinson 's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , ( 15 deaths , smr 2.07 , ci 1.16 - 3.42 ) were elevated .
there were four als deaths , all women ( smr 4.35 , ci 1.19 - 11.14 ) .
mortality was elevated for myeloma ( 7 deaths , smr 2.11 , ci 0.84 - 4.34 ) , particularly among workers employed 10 years or more ( 5 deaths , smr 2.80 , ci 0.91 - 6.54 ) .
no linear associations between mortality and duration of employment were observed for the cancers of interest .
conclusion this update found that the earlier reported excess in this cohort for biliary , liver and gall bladder cancer persisted with longer follow - up. excess mortality for intestinal cancer among women was elevated across categories of duration of employment ; myeloma mortality was highest among those working 10 years or more .
the small numbers of deaths from liver and intestinal cancers , myeloma and nervous system diseases coupled with the lack of an exposure - response relationship with duration of employment preclude drawing definitive conclusions regarding pcb exposure and these causes of death .
background polychlorinated biphenyls ( pcbs ) are synthetic chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons produced commercially in the u.s. from 1929 to 1977 and used as electrical insulating and heat exchange fluids due to their high stability , dielectric properties , resistance to oxidation , and incombustibility [ 1,2 ] .
peak production of pcbs occurred in the early 1970s .
pcbs were banned in 1977 from u.s. production and distribution because of concern about the persistence of pcbs in the environment and potential health risks [ 2 ] .
pcbs remain a potential occupational exposure , especially to persons who repair electrical equipment .
the purpose of this study was to update the mortality experience of a cohort of electrical capacitor manufacturing workers considered highly exposed to pcbs and to re - examine the increased risks for mortality from cancers of the liver and rectum previously observed in this cohort , primarily among women employed in one plant [ 3,4 ] .
these excesses had not been found to be related to duration of employment or time since first exposure in pcb - exposed jobs .
other a priori outcomes of interest for which previous studies indicated increased risks with respect to pcb exposure included mortality from all cancers [ 5 ] , non - hodgkin 's lymphoma ( nhl ) [ 6 ] , and breast [ 7 ] , skin ( melanoma ) and brain cancer [ 8 ] .
recent studies have also associated pcb exposure with risk of prostate [ 9,10 ] and stomach and intestinal cancer [ 11 ] .
methods the study plants have been described previously [ 3,4 ] .
briefly , workers were employed for at least 90 days in electrical capacitor manufacturing at a new york plant ( plant 1 ) between january 1 , 1946 , and june 30 , 1977 , or at a massachusetts plant ( plant 2 ) between january 1 , 1939 , and march 29 , 1976 )[ 3,4 ] .
the study cohort for this analysis was restricted to 2572 workers ( plant 1 : 973 ; plant 2 : 1599 ) who held jobs identified as having the highest , most direct exposure to pcbs ( e.g. , impregnation , sealing and testing capacitors ) and excluded workers confirmed at the time of the original study to be solvent exposed [ 4 ] .
pcbs at both plants included , at various times , aroclor 1254 ( 54 % chlorine ) , aroclor 1242 ( 42 % chlorine ) , and aroclor 1016 ( 41 % chlorine ) [ 4 ] , with less chlorinated varieties used more recently .
at any given time , it is likely that more than one aroclor was in use .
at plant 1 , use of aroclor 1254 was phased out in the 1950s and aroclor 1016 was first used beginning in 1971 [ 12 ] ; at plant 2 , specific dates are not known .
niosh conducted exposure surveys at both plants in the spring of 1977 .
at plant 1 the time - weighted average ( twa ) air samples ranged from 24 - 476 mug / m3 .
pcb levels were generally higher at plant 2 , with twas from 50 - 1260 mug / m3 [ 4 ] .
vital status was updated through december 31 , 1998 .
vital status was ascertained by linking with records of the social security administration , the internal revenue service , the national death index ( ndi ) [ 13 ] , the u.s. postal service and credit bureaus .
causes of death were obtained from ndi plus and from death certificates .
a qualified nosologist coded causes of death from death certificates according to the international classification of diseases ( icd ) revision in effect at the time of death .
the mortality experience of the cohort was analyzed using the niosh personal computer life - table analysis system ( pc - ltas ) [ 14,15 ] .
each cohort member accumulated person - years at risk ( pyar ) beginning on january 1 , 1940 , or the date the worker achieved 90 days of potential pcb exposure , whichever was later .
person time ended at the date of death , the date the worker was lost to follow - up , or the end date of the study ( december 31 , 1998 ) , whichever was earliest .
person time was first stratified into gender , race , 5 - year age and 5 - year calendar time strata and then multiplied by the appropriate u.s. death rates to generate expected numbers of deaths for each stratum .
the resulting expected numbers of deaths were summed across strata to generate the expected number of deaths for each cause of death category and overall .
ny county rates were created by combining three counties ( washington , warren , and saratoga ) , where 85 % of plant 1 workers resided ( as of last known address ) , and ma county rates by combining two counties ( bristol and plymouth ) , where 89 % of plant 2 workers resided .
the mortality analysis was repeated using these county death rates , death rates from the state of new york ( excluding new york city ) for plant 1 and death rates for massachusetts for plant 2 .
in addition to analyses using underlying cause of death , " multiple cause " of death ( mcod ) rates were also used to examine non - cancer outcomes and cancers having high survival rates ( e.g. , prostate and breast cancers ) [ 16 ] .
for myeloma , nhl and melanoma , u.s. rate files begin on january 1 , 1960 , as do multiple cause , state and county rate files .
for other causes of death , u.s. rate files begin on january 1 , 1940 .
the ratio of observed to expected number of deaths was expressed as the standardized mortality ratio ( smr ) .
smr 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) were computed assuming a poisson distribution for the observed number of deaths .
statistical significance of the smrs was computed using exact methods for 5 or fewer deaths .
for greater numbers of observed deaths , the approximation method of rothman and boice [ 17 ] was used .
duration of employment was used as a proxy for exposure to evaluate whether mortality was associated with length of exposure .
duration of employment was calculated , using re - coded work histories , by considering all time worked at the plant during the period of pcb use , not just time spent in jobs with the highest , most direct exposure to pcbs , as was done in the previous studies of this cohort [ 3,4 ] .
the list of the job codes designated in the previous studies as having the highest and most direct pcb exposure was not available for this update .
results are presented overall and stratified by gender , plant , duration of employment and time period of follow - up. three duration of employment groups (< 5 , 5 - 9 and >= 10 years ) were selected to allow comparisons with the previous update of this cohort [ 3 ] .
for results stratified by time period of follow - up ( original time period through 1982 and updated time period 1983 - 1998 ) , we considered causes of death considered important by brown and reported in his table 3 [ 3 ] .
trend tests were conducted for selected outcomes using methods specified in breslow et al .
[ 18 ] , but only for those outcomes with at least 10 observed deaths .
there was some ambiguity as to the racial composition of the plant 2 cohort , for which race was not coded in company records .
in ltas analyses , workers of " unknown " race are usually recoded ' white ' for the analysis , and white - race rate files are used .
however , the plant 2 cohort , like the surrounding community , included many immigrants from the cape verde islands and the descendants of those immigrants [ 4 ] .
most cape verdeans are considered to be multiracial )[ 19 ] and therefore possibly ' non - white ' .
however , because many death certificates that listed the decedent 's or decedent 's parents' place of birth as cape verde listed race as " white " and because many cohort women , interviewed in 1997 - 2001 for an ancillary study , identified themselves as " white " , we did not change the default ltas recoding .
results the previous update examined the mortality experience of 2588 workers ( plant 1 : 981 ; plant 2 : 1607 ) .
work histories were recoded for the present update .
sixteen workers ( 8 from each plant ) were found to have worked fewer than 90 days and were excluded .
gender was corrected for 34 workers .
the present update included 2572 workers. with 16 additional years of follow - up , 503 additional deaths ( plant 1 : 194 ; plant 2 : 309 ) and 38,078 additional pyar ( plant 1 : 14,742 ; plant 2 : 23,336 ) were observed .
cohort demographics and employment characteristics are presented in table 1 .
at plant 1 , more workers were male ( 61 %) .
at plant 2 , the proportion of male workers increased over time from a minimum of around 10 % in the early 1940s to about 37 % in 1976 .
because turnover was greater among men , men represent 41 % of the total number of workers ever employed at plant 2 .

b employment refers to time worked during the time period when pcbs were in use at the plants .
women and men worked in different jobs , especially at plant 1 .
at plant 1 , the top three job categories were : for male workers , plant engineering craftsman , tool and die maker , and treat room operator ; for female workers , assemble capacitors , tester , and check worker .
at plant 2 , the top three job categories were : for male workers , pre - assembly , post - assembly , and oven and kettle operator ; for female workers , post - assembly , pre - assembly , and electrical work .
smrs are presented for all workers combined and stratified by gender and plant in table 2 , for selected outcomes stratified by duration of employment in table 3 , and for selected outcomes stratified by time period of follow - up ( original time period through 1982 and update time period 1983 - 1998 ) in table 4 .
all tables present results based on u.s. mortality rates since results were similar using state and county rates , except as noted below .
for 94 % of the workers in this cohort , 20 years or more had elapsed since first employment ; therefore , results were not stratified by time since first employment ( tsfe ) when examining trends with duration of employment .

a results for vital status follow - up from 1940 through 1982 based on 2588 workers in jobs with the potential for the highest , most direct exposure to pcbs and computed from observed and expected deaths reported in table 3 of brown ( 1987 ) .
b results for vital status follow - up from 1983 through 1998 based on 2257 pcb exposed workers ( current cohort of 2572 workers [ 2588 workers less 16 with < 90 days of employment based on the recoded work histories ] in jobs with the potential for the highest , most direct exposure to pcbs less 291 workers who died and 24 workers lost to follow - up prior to 1983 ) .
a priori causes of interest overall mortality was similar to expected ( 798 deaths , smr 0.99 , ci 0.92 - 1.06 ) as was all cancer mortality ( 218 deaths , smr 1.01 , ci 0.88 - 1.15 ) ; however , cancer mortality was significantly elevated in the update time period ( 157 deaths , smr 1.18 , ci 1.00 - 1.38 ) .
cancers of the biliary passages , liver and gall bladder ( henceforth referred to as liver cancer ) were significantly elevated in the cohort ( 11 deaths , smr 2.11 , ci 1.05 - 3.77 ) .
elevations in liver cancer were observed for both genders and both plants .
the liver cancer elevation persisted across duration of employment categories but did not increase with duration of employment .
six new liver cancers were observed in the updated time period .
mortality from rectal cancer remained elevated in the cohort ( 6 deaths , smr 1.47 , ci 0.54 - 3.21 ) , although only 2 new rectal cancers were observed in the updated time period and the elevation was somewhat reduced from the original study .
the excess was largely due to an excess of rectal cancer deaths among women at plant 2 in the original follow - up period .
mortality from nhl was moderately elevated in the cohort ( 10 deaths , smr 1.31 , ci 0.63 - 2.41 ) , especially among women at plant 2 , but the highest nhl mortality was observed among workers with less than 10 years of employment .
results for other a priori outcomes were not remarkable .
breast cancer was reduced in the cohort overall ( 15 deaths , smr 0.59 , ci 0.33 - 0.98 ) and did not increase with duration of employment .
two deaths from skin cancer ( one malignant melanoma ) and three deaths from brain cancer were observed in the cohort .
other cancer mortality prostate cancer was not elevated in the cohort ( table 2 ) , but a modest elevation was observed among workers with 10 years or more of employment ( 6 deaths , smr 1.58 , ci 0.58 - 3.44 ) .
mortality from cancer of the intestine was elevated , but only among women ( 24 deaths , smr 1.89 , ci 1.21 - 2.82 ) .
the intestinal cancer elevation among women persisted in each duration of employment category but did not increase with duration of employment .
the excess was primarily due to intestinal cancer deaths among women at plant 2 in the updated time period .
other cancer outcomes to note include myeloma and cancers of the kidney and female genital organs .
mortality from myeloma was somewhat elevated ( 7 deaths , smr 2.11 , ci 0.84 - 4.34 ) , and , although there were too few deaths to test for a trend in mortality , the highest elevation was among workers employed for 10 years or more .
mortality from kidney cancer was somewhat elevated ( 8 deaths , smr 1.82 , ci 0.79 - 3.60 ) .
mortality from cancers of the female genital organs was elevated in the time period since the last update ( 14 deaths , smr 1.85 , ci 1.01 - 3.11 ) .
other causes of death other disease outcomes to note include diseases of the nervous system and sense organs , ischemic heart disease , and diseases of the digestive system .
mortality from other diseases of the nervous system and sense organs , a cause of death category that includes parkinson 's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , was elevated , particularly among women ( 15 deaths , smr 2.07 , ci 1.16 - 3.42 ) .
there were four als deaths , all women ( smr 4.35 , ci 1.19 - 11.14 ) .
in the multiple cause of death analysis , which considered all causes listed on the death certificate , an additional 23 deaths were observed for other diseases of the nervous system and sense organs and an increasing trend was observed with duration of employment .
a more detailed analysis can be found in steenland et al [ 20 ] mortality from ischemic heart disease was elevated , particularly among men ( 120 deaths , smr 1.20 , ci 0.99 - 1.43 ) ; however , the elevation was limited to workers with less than 10 years of employment .
mortality from diseases of the digestive system was reduced , particularly among plant 1 workers ( 6 deaths , smr 0.41 , ci 0.15 - 0.89 ) .
mortality from accidents , primarily transportation accidents , was elevated among plant 1 workers , especially when state rates were used ( 12 deaths , smr 2.01 , ci 1.04 - 3.51 ) ; however , mortality from accidents was reduced among plant 2 workers ( 13 deaths , smr 0.53 , ci 0.28 - 0.91 ) .
mortality from suicide was elevated among plant 1 workers , with the elevation even more pronounced when state rates were used ( 11 deaths , smr 2.79 , ci 1.39 - 4.99 ) .
discussion an additional 16 years of mortality experience has been examined in this study , totalling 59 years of observation time since 1940 .
the main goal of the study was to examine mortality from liver and rectal cancers previously found to be in excess among workers exposed to pcbs .
mortality patterns within this cohort corroborated other studies showing excesses of liver cancer [ 21 ] and intestinal cancer [ 5,11 ] among pcb - exposed workers , but this study did not show that these excesses were related to duration of employment .
in contrast to other studies of pcb exposure , only moderate excesses were found for nhl [ 6,22,23 ] and prostate cancer [ 9,10 ] , and none for cancers of the skin [ 8,24 ] , brain [ 8,25 ] , or breast [ 26 ] .
results cannot confirm whether observed excesses in mortality for liver and intestinal cancers , myeloma , and diseases of the nervous system are related to pcb exposure due to limited sample sizes , lack of exposure - response with duration of employment , and lack of information on potential confounders .
although data on smoking and alcohol use are not available for this cohort , there is some suggestion that these factors may not significantly contribute to the observed excesses of liver and intestinal cancers or myeloma .
mortality from some diseases associated with smoking and alcohol ( cirrhosis of liver and respiratory diseases ) was not elevated , although heart disease mortality , particularly ischemic heart disease in men , did not show a " healthy worker " effect [ 27 ] .
myeloma risk has not been associated with smoking and alcohol use [ 28,29 ] , but it has been linked to occupational chemical exposures [ 30,31 ] .
it is also unlikely that regional differences contributed to the observed excesses in mortality from intestinal and liver cancers or myeloma since state - and county - based smrs ( not shown ) were similar to those using u.s. referent rates .
we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors , including ethnic differences , may have contributed to the observed excesses of intestinal and liver cancers and myeloma [ 32 ] .
the ethnic make - up of the plant 2 workforce reflected that of the general population in the area , which was largely cape verdean and portuguese [ 4 ] .
the cape verde population was reported to be 71 % creole ( mulatto ) , 28 % african , and 1 % european [ 19 ] .
cape verde may share with other countries of west africa a substantial risk of liver cancer , due in large part to hepatitis infection [ 33 ] .
first - generation emigrants from west africa retain an increased risk of liver cancer [ 34 ] .
if most of the cape verdean workers at plant 2 were born in the united states , their baseline rates of liver cancer ( absent exposure ) would be similar to those in the u.s. , as liver and intestinal cancer rates in the offspring of immigrants are closer to those in their parents' adopted country than in their ancestral country [ 35 ] .
it is unlikely that ethnic differences account for our results because additional liver cancer deaths have occurred among plant 1 workers and males during the update period , suggesting that any initial differences in risk by plant and gender may have diminished over time with increased follow - up and latency ( table 4 ) .
exposure to pcbs appears to have been higher in plant 2 than plant 1 [ 3,4 ] and both plants used the same aroclor formulations .
if pcbs have a causal relationship with liver cancer one would expect more cancer in a more highly exposed population .
in the current update , new findings include observed excesses of myeloma and diseases of the nervous system among women , neither of which has been reported in other studies of pcb - exposed workers .
associations have been reported between pcb exposure and parkinson 's or other neuropathology [ 36,37 ] and between dioxin , structurally similar to some pcb congeners , and myeloma [ 38 ] .
although based on small numbers of deaths , smrs for myeloma were consistently elevated among men and women at both plants .
the excess in mortality from diseases of the nervous system requires further exploration in other pcb - exposed cohorts , in light of the fourfold excess in als mortality as well as excess parkinson 's and dementia deaths in this highly exposed cohort .
our separate mortality analysis of neurodegenerative disease mortality among a large ( n = 17,247 ) cohort of pcb - exposed workers which included all the workers in this study as well as other workers at these plants and workers at a third capacitor manufacturing plant found additional excess deaths among the workers with relatively higher cumulative exposure [ 20 ] .
this study cannot fully evaluate any association between pcb exposure and breast cancer , a subject of ongoing interest in the environmental exposure literature [ 39,40 ] , absent data on generally acknowledged breast cancer risk factors , such as parity and ages at menarche , first birth , and menopause .
we have initiated a study of breast cancer among women occupationally exposed to pcbs with an interview component to obtain information on known risk factors .
study limitations include the small cohort size and low number of deaths , lack of data on potential confounders and possible misclassification of exposure due to use of duration of employment as a surrogate for cumulative pcb exposure .
internal analyses using an internal referent group were not performed , since the cohort , by definition , included only workers who were highly exposed .
given these limitations , we will explore exposure - response relationships in an expanded cohort of workers at these plants with a wider range of potential pcb exposures .
these analyses , which will be reported elsewhere , will use newly created job exposure matrices developed to estimate cumulative exposure to pcbs for workers at the two plants .
conclusion our results are consistent with previous studies of this cohort which also reported significantly elevated mortality from liver cancers , which was not found to be associated with duration of employment .
in this update , the smr for rectal cancer was elevated but lower than that observed in the last update and was not related to duration of employment .
increased mortality was also observed for myeloma and intestinal cancer ( among women ) , but these elevations were not associated with duration of employment in a linear fashion .
mortality from diseases of the nervous system was associated with duration of employment .
nhl and prostate cancer mortality were only moderately elevated .
there was no evidence of increased mortality risk from cancers of the breast , skin or brain due to pcb exposure in this cohort .

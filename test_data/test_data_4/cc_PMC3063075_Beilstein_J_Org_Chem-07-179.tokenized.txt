this review focuses on the biological properties associated with this system .
various synthetic methods developed up to 2010 for these compounds are described , particularly those that involve the reactions of beta - ketonitriles , malononitrile , alkylidenemalononitriles and their derivatives with hydrazines , as well as some novel miscellaneous methods .
alkylidenemalononitriles 5 - aminopyrazoles hydrazines beta - ketonitriles malononitriles review the 5 - aminopyrazole system represents an important heterocyclic template that has attracted considerable interest because of its long history of application in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries [ 1 - 4 ] .
these compounds have been extensively investigated over the past one hundred years and their chemistry has been reviewed in two books published in 1964 [ 5 ] and in 1967 [ 6 ] .
structurally simple 5 - amino - 1 - tert - butylpyrazole - 4 - carboxamide i was found to inhibit p56 lck [ 7 ] ( fig. 1 ) .
5 - amino - 1 - ( 4 - methylphenyl ) pyrazole ii has been tested as an npy5 antagonist [ 8 ] .
5 - amino - 4 - benzoyl - 3 - methylthio - 1 - ( 2,4,6 - trichlorophenyl ) pyrazole iii has been reported as a potent corticotrophin - releasing factor - 1 ( crf - 1 ) receptor antagonist [ 9 ] .
5 - amino - 1 - ( 2,6 - dichloro - 4 - ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ) - 4 - ( 3 - methoxyphenyl ) - 3 - methylthiopyrazole iv has been described as a potent gaba inhibitor with selectivity towards insect versus mammalian receptors [ 10 ] .

recently , components of the mitotic machinery have been targeted in an attempt to develop novel anticancer agents .
these include critical signaling kinases such as the aurora , plk , and the cyclin - dependent kinases ( cdk ) .
compound vii ( azd1152 ) is the first aurora - b selective inhibitor to enter clinical trials [ 13 ] ( fig. 1 ) .
figure 1 pharmacologically active 5 - aminopyrazoles .
besides the importance of 5 - aminopyrazoles as biologically active agents , they are also useful synthons and building blocks for many heterocyclic products and can act as a binucleophile [ 14 - 18 ] .
cyclocondensation of 5 - aminopyrazoles with 1,3 - dielectrophiles has been extensively used for the preparation of bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles , especially in the preparation of condensed heterocycles such as pyrazolo [ 3,4 - d ] pyrimidines , pyrazolo [ 3,4 - b ] pyridines , imidazopyrazoles etc .
in view of significant interest in the synthesis of these heterocyclics , we herein report a detailed account of the synthetic methods available for 5 - aminopyrazoles .
as pyrazole derivatives do not exist in nature , probably , due to the difficulty in the construction of n - n bond by living organisms , their availability depends on the synthetic methods .
a large number of synthetic methods have recently appeared .
some of the important methods are outlined below .
1. reaction of beta - ketonitriles with hydrazines the most versatile method available for the synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazoles involves the condensation of beta - ketonitriles with hydrazines .
beta - ketonitriles 1 react smoothly with hydrazines to yield 5 - aminopyrazoles 3 [ 19 - 28 ] .
the reaction apparently involves the nucleophilic attack of the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazine on the carbonyl carbon with the formation of hydrazones 2 , which subsequently undergo cyclization by the attack of the other nitrogen on the nitrile carbon to produce 5 - aminopyrazoles 3 ( scheme 1 ) .
utilizing this reaction , a large number of 5 - amino - 1 - heteroarylpyrazoles have been synthesized in our laboratory by the reaction of several heteroarylhydrazines with alpha - cyanoacetophenones [ 29 - 30 ] .
the intermediate hydrazones 2 are rarely isolated , though their formation has been reported in the reaction of 2 - nitro / 2,4 - dinitrophenylhydrazines and aryl - alpha - cyanoacetaldehydes 1 ( r2 = aryl , r1 = h ) [ 31 ] .
scheme 1 general equation for the condensation of beta - ketonitriles with hydrazines .
recently , the synthesis of biologically active 5 - amino - 1 - heteroaryl - 3 - trifluoromethylpyrazoles 6 has been achieved by us by the reaction of trifluoroacetylbenzyl cyanide 4 with heteroarylhydrazines [ 32 ] .
the reaction of 2 - hydrazino - 4 - methylquinoline with alpha - trifluoroacetylbenzyl cyanide ( r = cf3 ) ( 4 ) at room temperature afforded the intermediate hydrazone 5 .
the hydrazone 5 was characterized by ir and nmr spectroscopy .
the ir spectrum of 5 showed a fundamental stretching band due to c = n at 2179 cm - 1 .
the 19f nmr spectrum of compound 5 showed fluorine signal at delta - 65 ppm due to cf3 group confirming the formation of hydrazone 5 , which exists as the z - isomer. from the literature [ 33 ] , the signal for the cf3 group in trifluoromethylhydrazones appears at delta - 64 to - 66 ppm for z - isomers and at delta - 67 to - 71 ppm for e - isomers .
as expected , 5 underwent cyclization in refluxing ethanol to give the corresponding 5 - aminopyrazole 6 [ 32 ] .
alpha - acetyl / formylbenzyl cyanide ( r = h / ch3 ) 4 on reaction with heteroarylhydrazines in refluxing ethanol yielded the corresponding 5 - amino - 4 - phenylpyrazoles 6 .
these compounds were found to be good antibacterial agents ( scheme 2 ) [ 34 ] .
scheme 2 reaction of hydrazinoheterocycles with alpha - phenyl - beta - cyanoketones ( 4 ) .
the isolation of hydrazones 8 has also been reported during the condensation of cyanoacetaldehyde ( 7 ) with hydrazines [ 35 ] .
these hydrazones 8 were cyclized to the corresponding 5 - aminopyrazoles 9 under basic conditions ( scheme 3 ) .
scheme 3 condensation of cyanoacetaldehyde ( 7 ) with hydrazines .
recently , kordik et al [ 36 ] treated alpha - cyano - 4 - nitroacetophenone ( 10 ) with aryl hydrazines in the presence of triethylamine and obtained the corresponding 5 - aminopyrazoles 11 in excellent yields .
the latter were further converted into their sulfonamide derivatives 12 by reducing the nitro group to an amino group by catalytic hydrogenation followed by treatment with an arylsulfonyl chloride ( scheme 4 ) .
scheme 4 synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazoles and their sulfonamide derivatives .
alternatively , 5 - aminopyrazoles 17 containing a cyclohexylmethyl - or phenylmethyl - sulfonamido group at position - 3 were prepared by treating beta - ketonitriles 16 with a substituted hydrazine in the presence of et3n in ethanol under reflux conditions .
the intermediate 16 was obtained from beta - ketoester 15 on treatment with tfa , which in turn was synthesized by condensing 4 - ( phenylsulfonamidomethyl ) cyclohexane carboxylic acid or benzoic acid 13 , respectively , with tert - butyl cyanoacetate ( 14 ) , as illustrated in scheme 5 [ 36 ] .
scheme 5 synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazoles , containing a cyclohexylmethyl - or phenylmethyl - sulfonamido group at position - 3 .
baraldi et al .
[ 37 ] utilized this method for the regioselective synthesis of 2 - alkyl - or 2 - aryl - 3 - aminothieno [ 3,4 - c ] pyrazoles 19 .
several alkyl - or arylhydrazine hydrochlorides on condensation with 4 - cyano - 3 - oxotetrahydrothiophene ( 18 ) in refluxing ethanol gave the thienopyrazoles in excellent yields .
the regioselectivity of this process has been confirmed by the treatment of 18 with phenylhydrazine , which generated a mixture of intermediate hydrazone 20 and 2 - phenyl - 3 - aminothieno [ 3,4 - c ] pyrazole ( 21 ) ( scheme 6 ) .
hydrazones 20 on treatment with 5 % hcl in ethanol underwent cyclization to afford 21 .
scheme 6 regioselective synthesis of 3 - amino - 2 - alkyl ( or aryl ) thieno [ 3,4 - c ] pyrazoles 19 .
a novel solid phase synthesis of some 5 - aminopyrazoles 24 and their n - acyl and n - sulfonyl derivatives has recently been reported by watson et al .
[ 38 ] via the resin supported beta - ketonitriles 22 ( scheme 7 ) .
the resin supported aminopyrazoles 23 were hydrolysed to yield 24 in excellent yields .
the synthesis is versatile and affords compoundswith a known pharmacophoric template ideally suited for combinatorial library generation .
scheme 7 solid supported synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazoles .
another solid phase synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazoles has been reported [ 39 ] by utilizing enamine nitrile 25 as the starting material ( scheme 8 ) .
in this reaction , compound 25 was readily hydrolyzed to afford the beta - ketonitrile derivative , i.e. , 4 - ( 1 - cyano - 2 - oxoethyl ) benzamide 26 which reacted efficiently with hydrazines to give the corresponding 5 - aminopyrazoles 27 .
subsequent cleavage from the resin afforded 5 - aminopyrazoles 28 .
this new 5 - aminopyrazole synthesis is more versatile and efficient than its predecessor as it avoids the use of troublesome beta - ketonitrile functionality .
this new route is also ideally suited for the synthesis of combinatorial libraries for drug target screening .
scheme 8 synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazoles from resin supported enamine nitrile 25 as the starting material .
in 2009 , an efficient three - component , two - step " catch and release " solid - phase synthesis of 3,4,5 - trisubstituted pyrazoles was reported which involved a base - promoted condensation of a 2 - sulfonyl - or a 2 - carbonyl - acetonitrile derivative ( 29 or 33 ) with an isothiocyanate and in situ immobilization of the resulting thiolate anion ( 30 or 34 ) on merrifield resin in the first step .
reaction of the resin - bound sulfonyl intermediate 31 with hydrazine , followed by release from the resin and intramolecular cyclization , afforded 4 - arylsulfonyl - 3,5 - diamino - 1h - pyrazoles 32 .
reaction of the resin - bound carbonyl intermediate 35 with hydrazine , on the other hand , led to 5 - aryl - 3 - arylamino - 1h - pyrazole - 4 - carbonitriles 36 , instead of the 5 - aminopyrazole 37 , which can be rationalized in terms of the higher reactivity of the carbonyl group of 35 toward hydrazine compared to the cyano group ( scheme 9 ) [ 40 ] .
scheme 9 two - step " catch and release " solid - phase synthesis of 3,4,5 - trisubstituted pyrazoles .
gao and lam recently reported a solid - phase synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazoles 42 which were used as precursors for the preparation of pyrazolo [ 5,1 - d ][ 1,2,3,5 ] tetrazine - 4 ( 3h ) - ones 43 .
resin 39 , obtained from wang resin 38 and a 5 - 10 fold excess of 1,1 ' - carbonyldiimidazole ( cdi ) , was treated with hydrazine hydrate in thf at room temperature to give hydrazide resin 40 , which on further treatment with 2 - ( 1 - ethoxyethylidene ) malononitrile in ethanol - ch2cl2 ( v / v 1:1 ) mixture at room temperature for 5 h provided resin bound 5 - aminopyrazole 41 .
resin 41 was easily cleaved with isopropylamine to give crude 42 , which was diazotized with 4 m hcl and sodium nitrite in water at 0 - 5 degreesc to provide an intermediate diazonium salt .
the latter underwent cycloaddition with an isocyanate in a one - pot reaction to give compound 43 ( scheme 10 ) [ 41 ] .
scheme 10 synthesis of pyrazolo [ 5,1 - d ][ 1,2,3,5 ] tetrazine - 4 ( 3h ) - ones .

scheme 11 synthesis of the 5,5 - ring system , imidazo [ 1,2 - b ] pyrazol - 2 - ones .
3 - oxopropanenitriles 16 on coupling with aromatic diazonium salts gave the corresponding 2 - arylhydrazones 47 , which on treatment with hydrazine hydrate formed the 5 - amino - 4 - arylazopyrazoles 48 .
3 - oxo - 3 - ( pyrrol - 2 - yl ) propanenitrile ( 16 ) reacted with trichloroacetonitrile to yield enamine 49 , which on further treatment with hydrazine hydrate afforded 5 - amino - 3 - ( pyrrol - 2 - yl ) pyrazole - 4 - carbonitrile ( 50 ) ( scheme 12 ) [ 43 ] .
scheme 12 synthesis of 5 - amino - 3 - ( pyrrol - 2 - yl ) pyrazole - 4 - carbonitrile .
synthesis of 5 - amino - 3 - aryl - 1h - pyrazoles 53 has been reported using benzoylacetonitrile 51 as starting material .
substituted phenylhydrazines on reaction with substituted 1 - aminocinnamonitriles 52 , obtained from base catalyzed reaction of benzoylacetonitrile 51 and acetonitrile , yielded 5 - amino - 3 - aryl - 1h - pyrazoles 53 .
corresponding amide derivatives , i.e. , n - ( 1,3 - diaryl - 1h - pyrazol - 5 - yl ) benzamides 54 were prepared by further treating aminopyrazoles 53 with substituted benzoyl chlorides in dcm ( scheme 13 ) [ 44 ] .
scheme 13 synthesis of n - ( 1,3 - diaryl - 1h - pyrazol - 5 - yl ) benzamide .
3 - iminobutyronitrile ( 55 ) couples with aromatic diazonium salts in a similar manner to yield 2 - arylhydrazono - 3 - iminobutyronitriles 56 .
treatment of hydrazones 56 with hydrazine hydrate in refluxing ethanol afforded the corresponding 5 - amino - 4 - arylazo - 3 - methylpyrazoles 57 in good yields [ 45 ] .
pyrazoles 57 further reacted with n - aryl - 2 - oxo - 2 - phenylethanehydrazonoyl bromides 58 to yield 3,7 - bis ( arylazo ) - 6 - methyl - 2 - phenyl - 1h - imidazo [ 1,2 - b ] pyrazoles 59 ( scheme 14 ) .
scheme 14 synthesis of 3,7 - bis ( arylazo ) - 6 - methyl - 2 - phenyl - 1h - imidazo [ 1,2 - b ] pyrazoles .
2. reaction of malononitrile and its derivatives with hydrazines malononitrile ( 60 ) and its derivatives have been shown to react smoothly with hydrazines to yield 3,5 - diaminopyrazoles that possess a wide spectrum of biological activity .
as early as in 1884 , rothenburg [ 46 ] reported the simplest reaction , i.e. , the condensation of malononitrile with hydrazine to give 3,5 - diaminopyrazole ( 61 ) ( scheme 15 ) .
scheme 15 synthesis of 3,5 - diaminopyrazole .
the work was subsequently reinvestigated by sato [ 47 ] who found that instead of 3,5 - diaminopyrazole , two other products were produced .
these compounds were characterized as 5 - amino - 4 - cyanopyrazole 64 and 5 - amino - 3 - hydrazinopyrazole ( 65 ) .
it was suggested that the formation of 64 resulted when two moles of malononitrile condensed with one mole of hydrazine .
in this reaction dimerization of malonitrile 62 occurs before the reaction with hydrazine to give 63 .
however , when one mole of malononitrile condenses with two moles of hydrazine , the formation of 65 takes place via the mechanistic pathway outlined in scheme 16 .
scheme 16 synthesis of 5 - amino - 4 - cyanopyrazole and 5 - amino - 3 - hydrazinopyrazole .
the reaction of substituted hydrazines with malononitrile follows a similar course to yield 67 , [ 48 - 49 ] which is the 1 - substituted analog of 64 ( scheme 17 ) .
however , with substituted malononitriles 66 no such dimerization is possible and the condensation with hydrazine hydrate results in the smooth formation of 3,5 - diaminopyrazoles 68 ( scheme 17 ) [ 50 - 53 ] .
scheme 17 synthesis of 3,5 - diaminopyrazoles with substituted malononitriles .
arulsamy and bohle [ 54 ] have reported that the reaction of oximinomalononitrile ( 69 ) with hydrazine gives 3,5 - diamino - 4 - oximinopyrazole ( 70 ) as the sole product ( scheme 18 ) .
scheme 18 synthesis of 3,5 - diamino - 4 - oximinopyrazole .
shvekhgeimer and ushakova [ 55 ] have reported the synthesis of 4 - arylazo - 3,5 - diaminopyrazoles 73 starting from substituted sulfonamides 71 .
sulfonamides 71 after diazotization undergo a coupling reaction with malononitrile to generate the hydrazones 72 , which on cycloaddition with hydrazine hydrate give the corresponding pyrazoles ( scheme 19 ) .
scheme 19 synthesis of 4 - arylazo - 3,5 - diaminopyrazoles .
reaction of ketenes , particularly those with a cyano group at one end and a leaving group such as alkoxy , alkylthio or halogen at the other , with hydrazine and its derivatives has assumed great importance in the synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazoles [ 56 - 57 ] .
the advantage of this procedure resides in the frequent possibility of forecasting the structure of the reaction product .
cheng and robins [ 58 ] have reported the synthesis of 5 - amino - 4 - cyanopyrazoles 76 by the reaction of hydrazines with alkoxymethylenemalononitriles 74a ( y = or ' , scheme 20 ) .
similar results were obtained when aminomethylenemalononitriles 74b ( y = nhr ') were treated with hydrazine indicating that reaction is initiated on the vinyl ether ( vinylamine ) group of 74a / b to give 5 - aminopyrazole - 4 - carbonitrile 76 through the intermediacy of 75 [ 59 ] .
however , elnagdi et al .
[ 60 ] have reported that when ethyl hydrazinoacetate condenses with 74a or b , a change in regiochemistry occurs to yield 3 - amino - 4 - cyanopyrazoles 77 ( scheme 20 ) .
scheme 20 synthesis of 3 - or 5 - amino - 4 - cyanopyrazoles .
ethoxymethylenemalononitrile ( r = oc2h5 , r1 = h ) 74c and bis ( methylthio ) - methylenemalononitrile ( r = r1 = sch3 ) 74d on condensation with hydrazine hydrate yield 5 - aminopyrazole - 4 - carbonitrile 76 ( r1 = h ) and 5 - amino - 3 - methylthiopyrazole - 4 - carbonitrile 76 ( r1 = sch3 ) , respectively .
these compounds were further treated with nitrous acid and coupled with different secondary amines to yield the triazenopyrazoles 78 .
compounds 78 were tested for biological activity against hiv - 1 and herpes simplex viruses , and showed moderate activity against hiv - 1 virus ( scheme 21 ) [ 61 - 62 ] .
scheme 21 synthesis of triazenopyrazoles .
an interesting synthesis of 5 ( 3 ) - aminopyrazoles 81 and 82 [ 63 ] has been developed using thioacetals 79 and 80 of malononitrile , which are conveniently obtained by the reaction of aniline and diethyl phosphite with bis ( methylthio ) methylenemalononitrile 74d , respectively .
reaction with hydrazine monohydrate was thought to occur with loss of the methylthio group by nucleophilic attack of hydrazine and subsequent cyclization by attack on the cyano group ( scheme 22 ) .
scheme 22 synthesis of 5 ( 3 ) - aminopyrazoles .
the synthesis of a few 3 - substituted 5 - amino - 4 - cyanopyrazoles 84 has recently been reported by the treatment of 1,1 - dicyano - 2 - methoxy - 3 - substituted propenes 83 with hydrazine hydrate in ethanolic tea ( scheme 23 ) [ 64 - 65 ] .
scheme 23 synthesis of 3 - substituted 5 - amino - 4 - cyanopyrazoles .
acylated hydrazine , as expected , reacts with ethoxymethylenemalononitrile 74a in a similar manner .
however , the reaction proceeds only in refluxing phosphorus oxychloride to produce compound 85 with a vinylated amino group ( scheme 24 ) [ 66 ] .
scheme 24 synthesis of 2 - {[( 1 - acetyl - 4 - cyano - 1h - pyrazol - 5 - yl ) amino ] methylene } malononitrile .
ketene dithioacetals 86 were utilized for the synthesis of corresponding pyrazole carbodithioates 88 by cyclization with methyl - or benzylhydrazine carbodithioate 87 in ethanolic tea at room temperature .
as before , the reaction proceeds via the nucleophilic substitution of the alkylthio group by the unsubstituted nitrogen of the hydrazine .
the reaction of bis ( methylthio ) methylenecyanoacetamide 86 ( r = ch3 , x = conh2 ) with aromatic amines gave the corresponding 3 - n - substituted aminoacrylamides 89 , which on further treatment with phenylhydrazine furnished the corresponding 5 - amino - 3 - arylamino - 1 - phenylpyrazole - 4 - carboxamides 90 ( scheme 25 ) [ 67 ] .
scheme 25 synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazole carbodithioates and 5 - amino - 3 - arylamino - 1 - phenylpyrazole - 4 - carboxamides .
ketene s,s - and s,n - acetals or tetracyanoethylene 91 on reaction with 3 - hydrazino - 6 - ( p - tolyl ) pyridazine afforded the 5 - amino - 4 - cyanopyrazoles 92 ( scheme 26 ) [ 68 ] .
scheme 26 synthesis of 5 - amino - 4 - cyanopyrazoles .

scheme 27 synthesis of thiazolylpyrazoles .
synthesis of 5 - amino - 1 - heteroaryl - 3 - methyl / aryl - 4 - cyanopyrazoles 102 has been carried out by us by treating various heteroarylhydrazines with alkylidenemalononitriles 101 in refluxing ethanol ( scheme 28 ) [ 70 ] .
the starting material 101a ( r = c2h5 , r1 = ch3 ) was obtained by the reaction of malononitrile with triethyl orthoacetate in acetic anhydride whilst methoxyarylmethylidenemalonitriles 101b,c were obtained via a two step procedure involving the aroylation of the malonitrile with aroyl chlorides in the presence of nah , followed by the treatment of the resulting intermediate with dimethyl sulfate .
scheme 28 synthesis of 5 - amino - 1 - heteroaryl - 3 - methyl / aryl - 4 - cyanopyrazoles .
nilov et al .
[ 71 ] have reported that the reaction of alpha - cyano - beta - dimethylaminocrotonamide ( 103 ) with hydrazine hydrate yields 5 - amino - 3 - methylpyrazole - 4 - carboxamide ( 104 ) .
the reaction proceeds by loss of dimethylamine in first step followed by cyclization via nucleophilic attack on cyano group ( scheme 29 ) .
scheme 29 synthesis of 5 - amino - 3 - methylpyrazole - 4 - carboxamide .
3. miscellaneous in addition to methods involving the reaction of hydrazine with beta - ketonitriles , malononitrile and its derivatives , a number of other procedures have also been developed for the synthesis of 5 - aminopyrazoles .
these methods are summarized below .
synthesis of 4 - acylamino - 3 ( 5 ) - amino - 5 ( 3 ) - arylsulfanylpyrazoles 107 by the reaction of 2 - acylamino - 3 - arylsulfanyl - 3 - chloroacrylonitriles 106 with hydrazine hydrate has been described .
compounds 106 were readily obtained from 105 , the addition products of carboxylic acid amides and trichloroacetaldehyde , by the reaction sequence shown in the scheme 30 [ 72 ] .
scheme 30 synthesis of 4 - acylamino - 3 ( 5 ) - amino - 5 ( 3 ) - arylsulfanylpyrazoles .
the reaction of 2 - chloro - 2 - chlorodifluoro / trifluoromethyl - 1 - cyano - 1 - diethoxy phosphorylethylene 108 with arylhydrazines in refluxing carbon tetrachloride results in the rapid replacement of the chlorine atom with the terminal nh2 group of arylhydrazines to give intermediates 109 , which is slowly transformed into 5 - amino - 1 - aryl - 4 - diethoxyphosphoryl - 3 - halomethylpyrazoles 110 .
2,6 - dichloro - 4 - trifluoromethylphenylhydrazine undergoes this reaction under more drastic conditions , i.e. , prolonged refluxing ( 16 - 20 h ) in carbon tetrachloride ( scheme 31 ) [ 73 ] .
scheme 31 synthesis of 5 - amino - 1 - aryl - 4 - diethoxyphosphoryl - 3 - halomethylpyrazoles .
heterocyclization reactions of trifluoromethylcyanovinyl phosphonates ( tfmcps ) 111 with arylhydrazines have been studied : tfmcps 111 can be used as precursors of 2,3 - dihydro - 1h - pyrazoles 114 modified by both trifluoromethyl and diethoxyphosphoryl groups .
arylhydrazines add rapidly to the alkene double bond of 111 ( x = cf3 ) at room temperature to produce an adduct which slowly cyclizes to afford 2,3 - dihydro - 1h - pyrazoles 113 in good yields .
4 - trifluoromethylphenylhydrazine also adds to ethylene 111 ( x = co2et ) , however , the resulting adduct 112 is formed primarily as a single diastereomer and does not undergo intramolecular cyclization to pyrazoline 113 even in refluxing benzene .
further , the reaction of isomeric alkene 115 with an arylhydrazine initially forms the unstable pyrazoline 116 that transforms into pyrazole 118 .
firstly , the c - p bond apparently undergoes hydrolysis and the resulting 117 is slowly oxidized by atmospheric oxygen to yield pyrazole 118 ( scheme 32 ) [ 74 ] .
scheme 32 synthesis of substituted 5 - amino - 3 - trifluoromethylpyrazoles 114 and 118 .
dodd et al .
[ 75 ] have reported an efficient solid - support synthesis of 5 - n - alkylamino and 5 - n - arylaminopyrazoles 123 .
heating the beta - ketoesters 120 with resin - bound amines 119 in resin - compatible solvents , such as nmp or toluene , in the presence of dmap gave the corresponding resin - immobilized beta - ketoamides 121 .
the latter beta - ketoamides 121 , aryl - or alkylhydrazines and lawesson 's reagent were suspended in a mixture of thf / py and heated at 50 - 55 degreesc to afford resin - bound 5 - aminopyrazoles 122 .

treatment of 148 with phenyl isothiocyanate in dmf in the presence of potassium hydroxide at room temperature , followed by treatment with methyl iodide afforded the novel ketene n,s - acetal 149 .
reaction of 149 with hydrazine in refluxing ethanol gave the corresponding 5 - aminopyrazole derivative 150 .
the reaction proceeds in the usual manner , i.e. , loss of methylthio group by nucleophilic attack of hydrazine in the first step followed by the cyclization ( scheme 41 ) [ 83 ] .

when a good nucleofugal group ( e.g. , cl , br and i ) is present at c - 3 in the isothiazole 165 , it is replaced by an amino group and 5 - aminopyrazoles 166 are obtained .
however , when the 3 - substituent is not a good leaving group it is retained in the pyrazole product 167 .
a series of 3 - chloro - 5 - substituted isothiazole - 4 - carbonitriles 168 bearing steric and / or electronic constraints at c - 5 were also treated with anhydrous hydrazine and the corresponding 3 - aminopyrazoles 169 were obtained in varying yields .

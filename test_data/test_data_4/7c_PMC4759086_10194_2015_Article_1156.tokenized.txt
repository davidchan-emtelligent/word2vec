when found in the cerebellopontine angle or the meckel cave [ 2 ] , the differential diagnosis includes meningioma , trigeminal neurinoma or epidermoid carcinoma .
correlated painful symptoms are often atypical , mimicking trigeminal neuralgia , cluster headache or trigeminal autonomic cephalgias ( tacs ) .
recommended therapy involves : chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide , high dose cytarabine , steroid ( dexamethasone ) , etoposide , and rituximab ( chaser ) followed by whole - brain irradiation .
we describe the case of a young man who came to our observation for excruciating headache related to mediastinal lymphoma with bilateral infiltration of the the ganglion of gasser .
case report a 30 - year - old man came to our attention suffering for the past 3 months of left fronto - orbital - zygomatic headache with intense pain , mainly nocturnal , subcontinuous , initially with nasal congestion and conjunctival injection , unresponsive to fans , triptans and oxygen therapy .
brain mri showed a lesion in the left meckel cave suggestive of trigeminal neuroma .
the patient was treated with carbamazepine and steroids .
radiosurgical treatment was advised .
waiting for surgery , the patient was admitted to our department because of inadequate pain control .
the neurological examination and serological tests were normal .
follow - up brain mri ( two months later ) revealed the presence of pathologic tissue with homogeneous enhancement in both ganglia of gasser cisterna along the course of the trigeminal nerve , associated with thickening of the dural surface and adjacent the temporal pole , suggesting granulomatous or lymphoproliferative disease .
cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) examination showed hyperproteinorrachia and non - neoplastic cells .
the chest and abdominal ct showed a mediastinal and pancreatic mass , confirmed by pet total body .
histological examination of mediastinal lesion confirmed diffuse large b cell lymphoma .
the patient is now in treatment with high - dose mtx infusion .
discussion our case emphasises the need for proper and timely diagnosis of the " trigeminal neuralgia - like " symptoms. with a lesion in the meckel cave , biopsy is mandatory for a more precise diagnosis and targeted therapy [ 3 ] .
written informed consent to publication was obtained from the patient ( s ) .

background previous one - dimensional network modeling of the cerebellar granular layer has been successfully linked with a range of cerebellar cortex oscillations observed in vivo .
however , the recent discovery of gap junctions between golgi cells ( gocs ) , which may cause oscillations by themselves , has raised the question of how gap - junction coupling affects goc and granular - layer oscillations .
to investigate this question , we developed a novel two - dimensional computational model of the goc - granule cell ( gc ) circuit with and without gap junctions between gocs .
results isolated gocs coupled by gap junctions had a strong tendency to generate spontaneous oscillations without affecting their mean firing frequencies in response to distributed mossy fiber input .
conversely , when gocs were synaptically connected in the granular layer , gap junctions increased the power of the oscillations , but the oscillations were primarily driven by the synaptic feedback loop between gocs and gcs , and the gap junctions did not change oscillation frequency or the mean firing rate of either gocs or gcs .
conclusion our modeling results suggest that gap junctions between gocs increase the robustness of cerebellar cortex oscillations that are primarily driven by the feedback loop between gocs and gcs .
the robustness effect of gap junctions on synaptically driven oscillations observed in our model may be a general mechanism , also present in other regions of the brain .
background oscillations provide a temporal framework for coordination of neural assemblies [ 1,2 ] , and slow movement , tonic contractions and motor commands are correlated with oscillatory patterns of activity at low frequencies in sensorimotor areas and cerebellum [ 3,4 ] .
indeed , local field potential ( lfp ) oscillations in the 5 to 30 hz range have been recorded in the hemispheric regions of the cerebellar cortex [ 5 - 8 ] , and previous one - dimensional network modeling of the cerebellar granular layer has been successfully linked with a range of in vivo oscillation data from the cerebellar cortex [ 9 - 12 ] .
in vivo , 5 to 30 hz lfp oscillations are accompanied by phase - locked bursts of multiunit activity representing granule cell ( gc ) firing , and appear to be generated at the level of the granular layer [ 6 ] .
the basic cerebellar cortex circuitry responsible for the generation of oscillations is driven by mossy fibers ( mf ) that excite both gcs [ 13,14 ] and golgi cells ( gocs ) [ 15 - 17 ] .
the axons of the gcs form ascending fibers that bifurcate in both directions in the parallel fiber ( pf ) layer [ 18,19 ] .
these pfs excite gocs along their way. by contrast , gocs are the only source of inhibition for the gcs in their vicinities [ 20 ] .
two inhibitory loops driven by the excitatory mf inputs emerge from this synaptic organization [ 21 ] ( figure 1b ) : a feedforward ( ff ) inhibitory loop and a feedback ( fb ) one .
the ff loop works through the mf - goc - gc pathway .
mfs excite gocs that then inhibit gcs .
the fb loop works through the mf - gc - pf - goc - gc pathway .
mfs excite gcs that then excite gocs that will inhibit gcs .

these pfs excite the gocs along the way. by contrast , gocs inhibit the gcs in their vicinities .
two inhibitory circuits driven by the excitatory mf inputs emerge from this synaptic organization .
one is a feedforward ( ff ) inhibitory circuit and the other is a feedback ( fb ) inhibitory circuit .
the ff circuit works through the mf - goc - gc pathway , whereas the fb circuit works through the mf - gc - pf - goc - gc pathway .
( c ) inset showing the neurotransmitters and synaptic receptors used by each modeled synaptic connection .
the goc model has alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid receptors ( ampar ) , which are activated by mf or pf glutamatergic ( glu ) terminals .
the gc model has ampar and n - methyl - d - aspartic acid receptors ( nmdar ; activated by mf glu terminals ) , and gabaa receptors ( gabaar ) ( activated by gabaergic terminals ( gaba ) coming from the nearby gocs ) .
because golgi interneurons do not inhibit each other , they were considered as independent units until the discovery that they express connexins and pannexins [ 22 - 27 ] and are electrically coupled by gap junctions [ 28,29 ] .
many functions have been attributed to gap junctions in neural networks in general [ 30 - 32 ] .
in particular , they are known for generating synchrony in networks of inhibitory neurons [ 33 - 37 ] , but it has also been suggested that they could desynchronize under particular conditions , such as in the presence of sparse mf inputs [ 29 ] .
the recent discovery that gap junctions between gocs receiving excitatory drive by intrinsic or tonic depolarization may cause oscillations by themselves [ 28 ] raises the question of how gap - junction coupling affects synaptically driven goc and granular - layer oscillations , an issue that has not yet been addressed in modeling or experimental studies .
to investigate this question , we developed a novel two - dimensional computational model of the goc - gc circuit , with and without gap junctions between gocs .
we systematically explored the behavior of these networks for different input and synaptic feedback loop strengths .
methods the model was constructed and numerically solved with the neuron simulator ( version 7.1 ) [ 38 ] .
the neuron code used to generate the network is available at the modeldb database http :// senselab.med.yale.edu / modeldb / .
model gocs the goc model is identical to a previously published model [ 39 ] , but without the compartmental axon .
it consists of four compartments including a soma and three dendrites , with an input resistance measured at the soma of 159 momega .
it has 12 voltage - dependent ionic channels reproducing goc intrinsic firing and responsiveness to somatic current injection [ 40 ] .
we adopted a resting membrane potential of - 60 mv and a passive leakage current with reversal potential at - 44.5 mv. the frequency versus current ( f / i ) curve of a single goc model is shown in figure 2a .
note that gocs have spontaneous ( pacemaking ) firing at 0 pa , and increasing firing rates upon strong current injections .

( a ) golgi cell ( goc ) frequency versus current ( f / i ) curve ; ( b ) granule cell ( gc ) f / i curve .
mean firing frequency was measured over a 10 second simulation .
model gcs the gc model is based on previously published models [ 41 - 44 ] .
briefly , we reduced a multicompartmental model [ 44 ] to a single compartment model that is suitable for use in the neural network model .
the gc model is a spherical compartment with a diameter of 11.8 mum and input resistance of 1.62 gomega .
it is somewhat similar to a previous single - compartment model [ 41 ] , but using upgraded channel densities and ionic channels [ 42,43 ] .
the f / i curve response of the gc model is shown in figure 2b .
note that gcs have no spontaneous firing , and their firing threshold is around 10 pa. these electrotonic compact neurons can fire at 150 hz in response to a current injection of 50 pa. the model neurons were validated to reproduce in vitro preparations at room temperature [ 40,41 ] .
because we verified that the neuron models work best in that temperature range [ 41 - 43 ] and do not have robust behavior at higher temperatures , we used a temperature of 23degreesc for all model neurons .
network description the model has a spatial dimension of 0.15 x 1.5 mm , and it is composed of three two - dimensional ( 2d ) matrices , respectively representing the mf , gc and goc layers ( figure 1 ) .
we choose a 2d structure as an intermediate level between the one - dimensional ( 1d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) approaches , allowing us to run computationally less expensive simulations while preserving the basic characteristics of the biological networks .
the 2d structure is more accurate than the previously used 1d approach [ 9 ] , allowing us to connect gocs along multiple axes by gap junctions .
it also has a smaller number of cells than in the 3d approach [ 45,46 ] , allowing us to simulate larger pieces of cerebellar tissue ( 0.15 x 1.5 mm ) .
in this way , the synaptic weights , delays , and gap - junction conductances ( gj ) can still be associated with realistic euclidian distances between the neurons .
the network model has a total of 9,225 cellular units and 935,063 synaptic connections distributed along the layers .
the three layers are composed of 900 ( 10 x 90 ) spike - generator mfs , 8100 ( 30 x 270 ) conductance - based gcs and 225 ( 5 x 45 ) conductance - based gocs .
there are 32,547 mf synapses on gc alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid receptors ( ampar ) and n - methyl - d - aspartic acid receptors ( nmdar ) , 20,822 mf synapses to goc ampar , 783,017 gc synapses to goc ampar , and 66,130 goc synapses to gc gamma - aminobutyric acide ( gaba ) a receptors .
these numbers arise from several parameters based on published data available [ 13,14,17,47,48 ] or from previous computational models [ 9 ] , as described in more detail below .
some parameters were adopted because of computational limitations .
for example , there are about 400 gcs for every goc in the rat cerebellum [ 49,50 ] , but for modeling long pieces of the cerebellar cortex ( 1.5 mm ) it is not practical to simulate 90,000 gcs .
therefore , we used a more reasonable ratio of 36 gcs for every goc , which was sufficient for obtaining synaptically driven oscillations .
to avoid artificial synchrony in the network , several model parameters were randomized .
this included the leak current , membrane area and initial membrane potential of each neuron , which were varied by +/ - 20 % around their mean value .
the x and y spatial coordinates of the neurons were also randomized by +/ - 20 % to obtain more physiological spatial distributions and cause an effective randomization of distance - dependent synaptic and gap - junction strengths ( see additional file 1 , figure s1 and figure s2 ) .
synaptic conductances and spike conduction times synaptic conductances were modeled by double exponential functions according to maex et al .
[ 9 ] .
the ampar conductance model has a rise time constant tau1 = 0.03 ms , decay time constant tau2 = 0.5 ms and reversal potential erev = 0 mv [ 51,52 ] ; the nmdar conductance model has tau1 = 1 ms , tau2 = 13.3 ms , erev = 0 mv [ 53 ] ; and the gabaar conductance model has tau1 = 0.31 ms , tau2 = 8.8 ms and erev = - 75 mv [ 54 ] .
the activation of at least two mfs was required to elicit a gc spike [ 53 ] .
the spike - conduction time defines the delay that a presynaptic spike takes to propagate from the axon hillock to the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron and then activate the postsynaptic neuron , and it depends on the speed of the propagation and the distance between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons .
the propagation delays and the synaptic conductances were scaled according the distance between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron .
delays increased linearly with the euclidian distance of the fibers , assuming a uniform speed of action potential propagation of 0.5 m / s [ 55,56 ] .
the mean +/ - sd delay was 0.026 +/ - 0.009 ms for mf to gc ampar and nmdar , 0.312 +/ - 0.148 ms for mf to goc ampar , 1.308 +/ - 0.695 ms for gc to goc ampar , and 0.0758 +/ - 0.028 ms for goc to gc gabaar ( see additional file 1 , figure s3 ) .
the macroscopic conductance calculated from inhibitory / excitatory postsynaptic currents ( ipscs / epscs ) recorded from voltage - clamp experiments to monosynaptic stimulation is around 124 picosiemens ( ps ) for mf to gc [ 14 ] , 833 ps for mf to goc [ 17 ] , and between 137 ps [ 14 ] and 420 ps [ 17 ] for goc to gc. the estimated pf to goc macroscopic conductance is around 666 ps [ 17 ] .
except for the pf to goc connections , which were constant along pfs [ 52 ] , all other synaptic conductances decreased exponentially with the euclidian distance ( decay parameter ) being equal to 0.01 / mum , which implied a glomeruli - like pattern of connectivity [ 57 ] .
the scaled mean +/ - sd synaptic conductances for mf to gc ampar and nmdar were 2.28 +/ - 0.11 ns and 0.198 +/ - 0.009 ns , mf to goc ampar 0.706 +/ - 0.506 ns , goc to gc gabaar 0.968 +/ - 0.140 ns , and pf to goc ampar 2.588 ns ( see additional file 1 , figure s4 ) .
network connectivity the connectivity of the network is based on the convergence and divergence patterns of the cerebellar cortex neurons ( see additional file 1 , figure s5 ) [ 48,58 - 60 ] .
we adopted a mean convergence of four mf on each gc [ 13,14 ] .
for mf to goc , the numbers are not well known , but are > 4 [ 17 ] .
considering the large goc dendritic tree [ 20,52 ] , we selected an average of 100 .
one mf can supply excitatory synapses to about 400 gcs [ 60 ] , but because we used smaller gcs : goc ratios , then each mf diverged to 39 gcs and 25 gocs .
the mean convergence of pf to goc was 4000 [ 58,60 ] , and about eight goc connections were made on each gc [ 13 ] .
gocs extend broadly branching axons to up to around 5700 gcs in cats [ 49 ] , and single gocs presumably can trigger inhibition in thousands of gcs [ 17,47 ] , but , once again , because of our reduced gcs : goc ratios , every modeled goc diverged to about 350 gcs , and each pf diverged to 100 gocs .
gap junctions the membrane potential response of a non - spiking goc coupled by gap junctions to a spiking goc is composed of a depolarizing component related to the rising and falling phases of the action potential , and a hyperpolarizing component linked to the undershoot phase [ 28 ] .
this coupling effect of gap junctions is illustrated by two coupled goc models showing one spiking goc stimulated either by mf input ( figure 3a ) or by a current pulse ( figure 3c ) , and transmitting the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing components of spikes to another goc ( figure 3b , d ) , replicating experimental observations .
note that gap junctions placed between dendrites ( figure 3 , black lines ) or between somata ( figure 3 , red lines ) produced the same effect in our goc models .
figure 3 electrical coupling between two golgi cells ( gocs ) connected by gap junctions either on the soma ( red ) or on the dendrite ( black ) .
membrane potentials recorded from the soma of two gap junction - coupled gocs in response to either ( a , b ) mossy fiber ( mf ) synaptic input at 10 hz or ( c , d ) to a depolarizing current pulse .
goc1 and goc2 were coupled by gap junctions either on the soma ( red ) or in the dendrite ( black ) .
( a , c ) on the top , goc1 is spiking and transmits to ( b , d ) thenon - spiking goc2 below .
in ( c ) , pacemaker firing in goc1 was suppressed with a hyperpolarizing current of - 0.1 na and a spike was evoked by a 100 ms pulse of 0.5 na at 1500 ms. the spikes of goc2 were always suppressed by setting all the sodium channel conductances to zero .
note ( b , d ) that the fast components of the spike ( rising phase , peak and falling phase ) are filtered more than the slower ones ( undershoot ) , and that gap junction location does not matter much ( red and black curves are superimposed ) .
dotted lines indicate the goc resting membrane potential .
the gap junctions show low - pass filtering effects [ 28 ] : fast components of the spike ( rising phase , peak and falling phase ) are more filtered than the slower ones ( undershoot ) by the non - spiking goc coupled by gap junctions ( figure 3b , d ) .
moreover , in accordance with experimental data [ 28 ] , we modeled the gj decaying with distance between the soma of gocs in the network ( decay parameter 0.03 / mum ) .
in addition , we randomized the gj by 60 % to reproduce the physiological variability [ 28 ] .
for short distances between gocs , the ( gj ) ranged from 0.25 to 1.25 ns [ 28 ] ( see additional file 1 , figure s1 ) .
stimulation pattern the network was stimulated with spatially uniform random mf spikes .
the mf input firing rates followed a normal distribution with center at a given stimulation frequency .
in this way , the network was stimulated with mf mean firing rates ranging from 1 to 100 hz. for each simulation , the model ran without mf inputs for 1 second , and then mf inputs were presented for another 1 second .
the specific mean +/ - sd of the gaussian distributions for the mf firing rates were 1 +/ - 0.71 , 5 +/ - 1.90 , 10 +/ - 3.00 , 15 +/ - 3.33 , 20 +/ - 4.28 , 40 +/ - 6.16 , 70 +/ - 7.57 and 100 +/ - 8.72 hz. in some cases , our simulations achieved unnaturally high sustained goc firing frequencies of up to 120 hz during strong mf inputs , which we attribute to the absence of modulation in our simulated mf input .
gocs fire transiently at high rates after stimulation in vivo [ 16 ] .
the high sustained goc firing rates during strong mf inputs are not a limitation of the model itself , but rather of the steady - state input condition that we required to analyze oscillations under spatial and temporal steady - state conditions .
in some simulations , we analyzed the resonance frequency of the goc layer in response to injection of sinusoidal current waves in the soma of each goc .
in this case , both gocs and gcs received background gaussian mf inputs at 7 +/ - 2.86 hz to introduce noise into the network .
the peak of the sinusoidal currents was set at +/ - 0.1 na and the frequency was set at 1 hz , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 and 100 hz. in addition , the resonance frequency of a larger version of the network elongated to 6 mm was tested in response to the following gaussian distributions of mf firing rates : 1 +/ - 0.71 , 5 +/ - 1.90 , 10 +/ - 3.00 , 15 +/ - 3.33 , 20 +/ - 4.28 , 30 +/ - 4.92 , 40 +/ - 6.15 , 45 +/ - 6.34 , 50 +/ - 6.63 , 55 +/ - 6.86 , 60 +/ - 7.17 , 65 +/ - 7.39 , 70 +/ - 7.57 , 80 +/ - 8.10 , 90 +/ - 8.24 and 100 +/ - 8.72 hz. data analysis border effects of the network were avoided by using only the neurons in the center of the network for the analysis .
the borders were removed until the spatial distributions of cellular firing frequencies were uniform along the x and y axes of the network .
in this way , the specific matrix dimensions considered for the analysis were 6 x 82 ( 492 ) for the mf layer , 18 x 246 ( 4428 ) for the granular layer and 3 x 41 ( 123 ) for the goc layer .
we then recorded the spike timings of all neurons in the network for each simulation , and used the cellular indexes and the spike timings to construct the raster plots .
we averaged the number of spikes of each firing neuron across the stimulation time to obtain the mean firing rates ( mfrs ) for each network layer .
we used 1 millisecond bins to calculate the total number of spikes of the each layer of network per bin to produce the population spike timing histograms ( psths ) , then calculated the spectral frequencies of the psth oscillations for the gocs using morlet wavelet analysis [ 61 ] ( see additional file 1 , figure s6 ) .
for the analysis of the amplitudes of the oscillation cycles and the latencies for the occurrence of the oscillations , the psths for the gocs were filtered by a low - pass butterworth filter of order 5 with cut - off frequency of 500 hz to remove the background noise from the signals .
all the network responses were analyzed for 1 second of simulation in the presence of the stimulus ( 1000 to 2000 ms ) .
results all network conditions were compared for the presence or absence of gap junctions .
raster plots and psths were obtained for each condition , and the oscillation frequency of the psths was analyzed .
the granular layer works as a resonator that is enhanced to oscillate around a characteristic frequency [ 62 ] .
therefore , we analyzed ( similar to the approach described previously [ 28 ]) , the resonance frequency of the goc layer in response to injection of sinusoidal waves into the soma of each goc .
both gocs and gcs received low - frequency random mf input to introduce noise into the network .
in the absence of pf inputs , the goc network without gap junctions had a resonance frequency of 15 hz ( figure 4 , blue triangles ) .
the presence of gap junctions did not change this resonance frequency , but it increased the power of the oscillations ( figure 4 , red triangles ) .
the presence of gap junctions also induced a secondary gamma band peak around 30 hz. these results are consistent with previous modeling studies [ 28 ] .
when pfs were introduced into the network , resonance was lost and the power of oscillations increased in response to all frequencies of sinusoidal current , both in the presence ( figure 4 , red dots ) and absence of gap junctions ( figure 4 , blue dots ) .
figure 4 mean golgi cell ( goc ) oscillation power versus sinusoidal current input frequency .
the mean power of the goc population spike timing histograms ( psths ) for the network without gap junctions is in blue , and with gap junctions is in red .
the response of the network without parallel fibers ( pfs ) ( feedforward configuration ) is shown with triangles , and the response with pfs ( feedback configuration ) is shown with circles .
after studying the responses of the network to sinusoidal waves , the network was stimulated directly by synaptic inputs with varying rates of mf input on gocs and gcs .
we also investigated the influence of the strength of the pfs on the network activity in the presence and absence of gap junctions between gocs .
initially , we tested the influence of the synaptic inputs on the mfrs of gocs and gcs .
mfrs increased with increasing mf rates and pf strengths ( figure 5a , c ) , and gap junctions did not affect the mfrs of the neurons in the network ( figure 5b , d ; see additional file 1 , figure s7 ) .
gc mfrs were 0.5 to 3 hz and goc firing rates were 20 to 120 hz ( see methods ) .
in vivo , gc and goc mfrs are 2 to 7 hz [ 6,63 - 65 ] .

the x axis = mf input rate ( hz ) ; y axis = parallel fiber ( pf ) synaptic weight (%) ; and z axis = mean firing frequency ( hz ) .
we next investigated the effect of gap junctions on network oscillations under different conditions of mf activation and pf - connection strengths .
we previously showed that the granular layer oscillates when the pf input to gocs is strong ( feedback configuration ) and it is activated by mf input ; conversely , in the absence of pf input ( feedforward configuration ) or of mf activation , goc firing is desynchronized [ 9 ] .
the latter is no longer true in the presence of gap junctions between gocs ( figure 6 ) .
in the feedforward configuration , gap junction - coupled gocs had a strong tendency to generate spontaneous slow and poorly synchronized goc oscillations ( figure 6b , 800 to 1000 ms ) .
activation of mf input improved synchronization , and slightly increased oscillation frequency .
whereas gap junctions have a pronounced effect in the feedforward configuration , their effect is more subtle in the feedback configuration of the network , which more closely approximates the in vivo behavior of the granular layer [ 66 - 68 ] ( figure 7 , figure 8 , figure 9 , figure 10 ) .

( c ) same as ( b ) but for the gc layer .
in the presence of mf and pf input , the frequency and the power of the network oscillations increased with the strength of the pfs and with the rate of mf inputs ( figure 7 ) .
the power spectral density of the oscillations showed a primary band at 15 to 30 hz , and a secondary gamma band at 30 to 100 hz for mf inputs at 1 , 5 and 10 hz ( figure 7 ) .
the frequency and the power of the secondary band also increased with the pf strength and with the mf mfrs , and gamma oscillations became the primary band for higher mf mfrs (> 10 hz ) .
no resonance was observed in the regular network of 1.5 mm length .
this can be explained by the long delays in the propagation of the spikes along the pfs , required for the occurrence of resonance in cerebellar cortex models [ 11,32 ] .
because the pfs did not reach their maximum lengths ( 2.5 mm in each direction [ 19 ]) in the regular network , this implied resonance frequencies at non - physiologically high frequencies that were beyond the range we explored .
to overcome this limitation , we ran control simulations with a network that had a length of 6 mm , providing enough pf length for the emergence of resonance that occurred at the expected frequency of 65 hz [ 11,32 ] with 100 % of pf synaptic weight ( see additional file 1 , figure s8 ) .
the presence of gap junctions did not change the primary resonance frequency of the elongated network .
the oscillations were primarily driven by the synaptic feedback loop between gocs and gcs , and the presence of gap junctions did not change their frequency , but increased their power , particularly with weak pf synaptic weights and slower mf inputs ( figure 7a - c ) .
this is exemplified by the raster plots ( figure 7 , figure 8 , figure 9 , figure 10 ) .
before the activation of the mfs , there was no spontaneous gc firing ( figure 8c , 800 to 1000 ms ) , and therefore there was no pf input onto the gocs .
during this period , the only activity in the network came from the pacemaker spiking activity of gocs ( figure 8b ) , which have a tendency to synchronize in the presence of gap junctions ( red dots and traces ). by contrast , when mfs were activated , gcs started firing , therefore gocs received both mf and pf inputs ( figure 8b , 1000 to 1200 ms ) , and in turn inhibited the gcs .
the result of the activation of this feedback loop was the emergence of synaptically driven synchronous oscillations in the neural network ( figure 8 , figure 9 , figure 10 , 1000 to 1200 ms ) .
in the case of 100 % pf synaptic weight , the first oscillatory cycles were stronger in the presence than in the absence of gap junctions ( figure 8 and figure 9 ) .
this implies that during these initial cycles , the neurons are more synchronized in the presence than in the absence of gap junctions ; afterwards , their behavior equalizes , and the psth amplitudes of the cases with and without gap junctions become similar .
however , the oscillations in the presence of gap junctions had a permanent change in phase , resulting from the fact that the latency for the occurrence of the first oscillatory cycle was smaller in the presence of gap junctions , whereas the frequency of the oscillations was the same in both cases ( figure 8 ) .
the robustness effect observed in the initial oscillatory cycles in the case with 100 % pf synaptic weight ( figure 8 ) was more pronounced in the presence of weak ( 10 %) pf synaptic weights ( figure 10 ) .
in this case , the weak synaptic feedback was sufficient to maintain the oscillations in the absence of gap junctions , but the presence of gap junctions strongly increased the synchrony of firing , resulting in a constant higher power for the oscillations ( figure 7b ) .
again , the first oscillatory cycle occurred earlier in the presence of gap junctions , but the frequency of the oscillations was still the same in both cases , implying a change of their phase ( figure 10 ) .
the other synaptic weight of the feedback loop , that of the inhibitory goc - gc gabaa receptors , had much less effect .
this parameter is important to maintain the occurrence of oscillations , but it had little effect on the robustness effect .
the minimum synaptic weight required to avoid disruption of the oscillations in the cerebellar cortex model increased along with the mf mfrs , and it was independent of the presence or absence of gap junctions between gocs ( see additional file 1 , figure s9 ) .
we conclude that in the physiologically more realistic feedback condition , gap junctions mainly increase the robustness of the oscillations caused by the synaptic feedback .
this robustness effect was quantified ( figure 11a ) as the mean difference of the psth amplitude between networks with and without gap junctions .
the stronger difference was observed in the case of low mf input ( mfrs at 5 hz ) , and the mean difference between the psth amplitudes decreased as the mf mfr increased .
in addition , the mean difference in the psth amplitudes decreased with increasing pf synaptic weights ( most pronounced at < 30 %) .
however , even in the cases where the robustness effect was limited to the initial oscillatory cycles ( figure 8 and figure 9 ) , it was sufficient to affect the latency for the occurrence of the first oscillatory cycle ( figure 8 , figure 9 , figure 10 and figure 11b ) , and therefore permanently affect the phase of the oscillations .
the difference between the latency for the occurrence of the first oscillatory cycle in the network without or with gap junctions ( figure 11b ) showed a similar inverse relationship with the mf mfr and the pf synaptic weights to that of the difference in psth amplitude ( figure 11a ) .
the presence of gap junctions between the gocs reduced the latency for the occurrence of the first oscillatory cycle by several milliseconds over a wide range of input conditions .

( a ) mean difference in population spike timing histogram ( psth ) amplitudes ( spikes / bin ) in the golgi cell ( goc ) layer with or without gap junctions for different strengths of parallel fiber ( pf ) connections and mossy fiber ( mf ) input rates .
the mean and standard deviation were obtained from the amplitude of the oscillation cycles occurring within the interval of 1000 to 2000 ms .
( b ) difference between the latency ( ms ) for the occurrence of the first oscillatory cycle after mfs were turned on in the network without or with gap junctions .
the robustness effect of gap junctions compensates for the randomization of elements in the network model , which was introduced to mimic biological variability .
we next examined whether the robustness effect was affected by the levels of randomization ( figure 12 ; see additional file 1 , figure s2 ) .
a representative situation with 20 % pf synaptic weight , producing an intermediate robustness effect , was used as the standard case for comparison .
we diminished or increased the cellular randomness ( that is , the leak current and diameter of soma ; figure 12a ) or the spatial and cellular randomness together ( figure 12b ) .
intermediate spatial and cellular randomness favored the occurrence of the robustness effect , but too much or too little randomness reduced it. too much randomness disorganized the goc spontaneous oscillations in the presence of gap junctions , and reduced the robustness effect in the presence of mf inputs ; too little randomness increased the spontaneous synchrony of gocs in the absence of gap junctions .
because the synchrony levels were already naturally very high , gap junctions did not make much difference , reducing the robustness effect .
abolishing spontaneous spiking of gocs [ 28 ] similarly increased synchrony and decreased the robustness effect ( results not shown ) .
there was thus a tuning curve for cellular and spatial randomness for the occurrence of the robustness effect ( figure 12a and 12b ) .
in addition , the robustness effect of gap junctions was diminished when the spatial randomness alone was suppressed ( figure 12c ) .
figure 12 effect of randomization on the robustness effect of gap junctions .
robustness effect was quantified as in figure 11a .
( a ) effect of changing the randomness in the leak currents and cellular diameters ( cell randomness ) relative to standard ( feedback configuration with 20 % parallel fiber ( pf ) synaptic weight ) .
( b ) effect of combined changes to the cell - randomness and the randomness in the spatial position of the cells relative to the standard .
( c ) effect of the lack of spatial randomness ( red ) or of sparser mf inputs onto golgi cells ( gocs )( black ) compared with standard ( blue ) .
finally , we tested whether a sparser mf synaptic input to gocs , which was used in another recent modeling study [ 29 ] and which is able to desynchronize gocs coupled by gap junctions in the absence of pfs ( see additional file 1 , figure s10 ) , would abolish the robustness effect observed in the presence of pfs .
unexpectedly , the robustness effect increased in the presence of sparse mf and regular pf inputs ( figure 12c ; see additional file 1 , figure s11 and figure s12 ) .
thus , the robustness caused by gap junctions is likely to occur in a large number of biologically relevant situations .
discussion many functions have been attributed to gap junctions in neural networks in general [ 31,32 ] , but their function in the cerebellum is still unclear .
recently , dugue et al .
[ 28 ] proposed that gap - junction coupling mediates tunable low - frequency oscillations and resonance in the cerebellar goc network , but they tested their hypothesis in an isolated goc layer model that uses very simplified neuron models .
our modeling results of the complete network , using state - of - art conductance - based models [ 39,44 ] , suggest a novel function for gap junctions between gocs , in improving the robustness of cerebellar cortex oscillations that are primarily synaptically driven .
our results in the network without pf connections confirmed the previous findings of dugue et al .
[ 28 ] ( figure 6 ) .
in contrast , our modeling results in a more realistic network with pf connections suggest that gap junctions between gocs increase the amplitude of the cerebellar cortex oscillations without affecting their frequency , which is primarily driven by the synaptic feedback loop between gocs and gcs as described previously [ 9,11 ] .
this robustness effect of gap junctions changes the timing of the first oscillatory cycles and improves their synchronization ( figure 8 , figure 9 , figure 10 ) , an effect that is more pronounced at low mf input rates and weak pf synaptic weights .
in our model , the robustness effect of gap junction vanished when the membrane potential of the neurons was homogeneous .
this happened when the intrinsic cellular properties and spatial variability of the network were abolished and gocs started firing artificially at very high synchrony , whether gap junctions were present or not .
however , the robustness effect was also suppressed when the network randomness was too high , which resulted in reduction in goc spontaneous synchronization in the presence of gap junctions .
these results ( figure 12a , b ) suggest that the robustness effect of goc gap junctions on the granular layer network is optimized to work at biologically relevant intermediate levels of cellular and spatial randomness .
oscillations observed in the granular layer in vivo tend to occur in a range of 5 to 30 hz [ 6,69 ] .
this is within the range of slow frequencies , where the robustness effect was stronger .
additionally , the real synaptic weights for the pfs onto gocs are not known .
the simulation results predict that , if values of 10 to 30 % are closer to physiological conditions than the 100 % pf maximal synaptic weight used in the model , then the robustness effect would be stronger and not restricted to the first oscillatory cycles only .
additional experimental measurements will be necessary to confirm this prediction .
moreover , the cerebellar oscillations observed in vivo tend to be transient [ 5 - 7 ] , which makes the effect of gap junctions on the initial oscillation cycles physiologically relevant .
besides the robustness effect , we also observed a decrease in latency for the start of the oscillations after the activation of mf inputs .
because the frequency of oscillations did not change , the change in latency implies a change in the phase of oscillations .
because of the important function of the cerebellum in controlling the timing of movements and reflexes [ 70,71 ] , such phase shifts can have important physiological consequences .
recently two combined experimental modeling studies on the effect of goc gap junctions on cerebellar oscillations presented contradictory results , which also differ from those in this study [ 28,29 ] .
as mentioned above , a crucial difference in our experiment is that we investigated the behavior of the full circuit , including the pf feedback loop , whereas the other studies considered isolated goc networks .
in the accompanying experimental work , parasagittal slices were used where the pfs had been cut .
an additional difference from the study of dugue et al .
[ 28 ] is our assumption that gocs show spontaneous pacemaker firing , as observed by forti et al .
[ 40 ] .
this discrepancy may result from differences in preparations .
forti et al .
[ 40 ] recorded from cerebellar slices from 16 to 21 - day - old wistar rats whereas dugue et al .
[ 28 ] recorded from heterozygous 20 to 60 day - old glyt2 - egfp c57 / bl6 mice , in which enhanced green fluorescent expression is controlled by the promoter of glyt2 , a glycine transporter .
besides the species and age differences , the transgenic manipulation might also have affected lugaro neurons , which form a source of goc inhibitory input [ 72 ] .
recently , vervaeke et al .
[ 29 ] suggested that gap junctions between gocs could play a desynchronizing role when mf inputs are sparse .
we confirmed that this is true for a network of isolated gocs , but when the synaptic feedback loop was included , we recovered the robustness effect of gap junctions ( figure 12c ) , demonstrating that our results apply to a wide range of conditions .
considering that inhibitory circuits with gap junctions showing oscillations are not exclusive to cerebellar neural networks [ 33,34,37,73 ] , the robustness effect of gap junctions observed in our model may be a general mechanism present in other regions of the brain .
in particular , our work suggests that results of experiments that block gap junctions should be interpreted with care ; disappearance of oscillations does not necessarily imply that gap junctions are the essential underlying mechanism .
instead the oscillations may be primarily synaptically driven , but depend on gap junctions to smooth out disruptive noise caused by biological variability and other factors .
conclusions our modeling results suggest that gap junctions between gocs do not cause the oscillations observed in the cerebellar granular layer under physiological conditions .
instead , they increase the robustness of these oscillations , which are driven by the synaptic feedback loop between gocs and gcs .
this effect is strongest for the first cycles of oscillation , and results in a permanent phase shift .
the robustness effect of gap junctions may be generalized to other regions of the brain with synaptically driven oscillations .

here we identify activating transcription factor 3 ( atf3 ) as a pivotal transcription factor for the regulation of bone resorption and bone remodeling under a pathological condition through modulating the proliferation of osteoclast precursors .
the osteoclast precursor - specific deletion of atf3 in mice led to the prevention of receptor activator of nuclear factor - kappab ( rank ) ligand ( rankl ) - induced bone resorption and bone loss , although neither bone volume nor osteoclastic parameter were markedly altered in these knockout mice under the physiological condition .
rankl - dependent osteoclastogenesis was impaired in vitro in atf3 - deleted bone marrow macrophages ( bmm ) .
mechanistically , the deficiency of atf3 impaired the rankl - induced transient increase in cell proliferation of osteoclast precursors in bone marrow in vivo as well as of bmm in vitro .
moreover , atf3 regulated cyclin d1 mrna expression though modulating activator protein - 1 - dependent transcription in the osteoclast precursor , and the introduction of cyclin d1 significantly rescued the impairment of osteoclastogenesis in atf3 - deleted bmm .
therefore , these findings suggest that atf3 could have a pivotal role in osteoclastogenesis and bone homeostasis though modulating cell proliferation under pathological conditions , thereby providing a target for bone diseases .
the integrity of the skeleton as well as bone modeling and remodeling is believed to be coordinately regulated by two different types of cells , i.e. , bone - forming osteoblasts and bone - resorbing osteoclasts12 .
an imbalance of the sophisticated regulation between osteoclasts and osteoblasts leads to pathogenesis as well as the etiology of certain metabolic bone diseases including osteoporosis or osteopetrosis3 .
several transcription factors have been identified as pivotal regulators of cell differentiation and function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts during skeletogenesis and bone remodeling4 .
runx2 is a cell - specific member of the runt family of transcription factors , which plays a critical role in cellular commitment / differentiation processes in osteoblasts5678 .
osterix is a zinc finger - containing transcription factor specifically expressed by osteoblasts of all skeletal elements to promote osteoblast differentiation9 .
in contrast , nuclear factor of activated t cells cytoplasmic 1 ( nfatc1 ) , which is specifically and potently induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor - kappab ( rank ) ligand ( rankl ) , is well - known as the key transcription factor of osteoclastogenesis10 in spite of its pivotal role in osteoblast function11 .
the transcription factor activating transcription factor 3 ( atf3 ) belongs to the atf / camp - responsive element - binding protein ( creb ) family and regulates mrna expression of various genes though its binding to the atf / creb cis - regulatory element1213 .
among the atf / creb family , atf4 expressed by osteoblasts is shown to be a positive regulator of both osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis14 .
moreover , creb also has a pivotal role in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation15 .
atf3 has been shown to be implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases , including metabolic diseases , immune diseases , inflammatory diseases , or cancer , as well as the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by regulating patterns of gene expression in various types of cells16171819 .
we have recently demonstrated that atf3 regulates the development of experimental osteoarthritis without affecting normal chondrogenesis under pathological conditions through its expression in chondrocytes20 .
atf3 is identified as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation by an in vitro study21 .
although atf3 has a critical role in cell function of neutrophil and macrophage among mature myeloid cells222324 , little attention has been paid to its implication in the pathogenesis of bone diseases as well as in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis till date .
expression profile of the atf family during osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis in vitro revealed that atf3 expression is highest at precursor stages of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts .
to establish the pivotal role of atf3 in bone homeostasis , we generated cell - specific ( osteoblast - specific and osteoclast precursor - specific ) atf3 deficient mice .
in this study , we showed the crucial role of atf3 in the cell - autonomous regulation of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vitro and in vivo .
subsequent analyses identified that atf3 regulates rankl - induced cell proliferation in osteoclast precursors .
in addition , we found that atf3 regulates cyclin d1 expression though modulating activator protein - 1 ( ap - 1 ) - dependent transcription in osteoclast precursor .
our results demonstrated that the rank - atf3 - cyclin d1 axis in osteoclast precursors is an essential pathway for the regulation of osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling .
results conditional deletion of atf3 in osteoclast precursors protects rankl - induced osteoclast activation and bone loss among different atf family members , expression of atf1 and atf4 was gradually decreased during osteoclastogenesis in vitro , with constitutive constant expression of atf2 and atf6 .
conversely , expression of atf3 and atf5 was highest in undifferentiated osteoclasts ( day 0 ) , and their expression levels were constantly very low during osteoclast differentiation ( day 1 - day 4 ) ( supplemental fig. s1 ) .
moreover , expression of atf3 was also highest in undifferentiated osteoblasts in vitro , and its expression was constitutively low during osteoblast differentiation ( day 7 - day 28 ) ( supplemental fig. s2 ) .
these results suggest that atf3 has a pivotal role in cellular function at precursor stages of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts .
to evaluate the physiological importance of atf3 in bone homeostasis in vivo , we first generated osteoclast precursor - specific atf3 knockout mice by crossing atf3 - floxed mice with cd11b - cre mice .
mice lacking atf3 in cd11b - expressing cells , hereafter referred to as cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice , were normal when compared with control mice in terms of physical appearance , fertility , body weight , and naso - anal length ( data not shown ) .
atf3 expression was markedly abolished in cd11b positive cells in the bone marrow of cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice ( fig. 1a ) , in accordance with a marked cre - mediated excision at the genomic dna level ( supplemental fig. 3a ) .
the bone volume to tissue volume ratio ( bv / tv ) of cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice was indistinguishable from control mice in both femurs ( fig. 1b ) and vertebrae ( fig. 1c and supplemental fig. 4a ) .
bone histomorphometric analyses revealed that the osteoclast surface / bone surface ( oc.s / bs ) , one of the indices of osteoclastic function , in addition to bone formation indices , such as bone formation rate ( bfr ) and osteoblast surface / bone surface ( ob.s / bs ) , were comparable between cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice and control mice ( fig. 1d , and supplemental fig. 4b,c ) .
these results show that atf3 deletion in osteoclast precursors does not affect bone volume and indices of osteoblastic and osteoclastic functions under the physiological condition .
we then investigated the possibility of the involvement of atf3 expressed by osteoclast precursors in pathogenesis in an osteoporosis mouse model using gst - rankl fusion protein injections .
rankl was injected in control and cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice at a daily rate over 2 days , followed by an analysis of bone phenotype .
rankl injection markedly induced bone loss in both femurs and vertebrae of control mice , whereas rankl - induced bone loss was markedly impaired in cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice ( fig. 1e - h ) .
moreover , the rankl - induced increase in osteoclastic parameters , oc.s / bs , and the number of osteoclast / bone perimeter ( n.oc / b.pm ) , were also repressed in cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice ( fig. 1i,j ) .
therefore , atf3 could be a pivotal modulator of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vivo under pathological conditions .
no abnormalities are shown under the conditional deletion of atf3 in osteoblasts under both physiological and pathological conditions further , we attempted to identify the importance of atf3 expressed in osteoblasts on bone homeostasis in vivo .
osteoblast - specific atf3 knockout mice were generated with collagen type 1 alpha 1 ( col1a1 ) - cre transgenic mice .
osteoblast - specific atf3 knockout mice , hereafter referred to as col1a1 - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice , exhibited no apparent change in osteoblastic and osteoclastic parameters ( fig. 2e - g ) as well as in the bone volume of both femurs and vertebrae ( fig. 2a - d ) .
a marked cre - mediated excision was confirmed in cultured osteoblasts of col1a1 - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice at the genomic dna level ( supplemental fig. 3b ) .
to further ascertain the effect of atf3 deletion in osteoblasts under the pathological condition , col1a1 - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice were subjected to ovariectomy ( ovx ) , followed by bone analyses .
ovx significantly induced bone loss in col1a1 - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice to a similar extent as in control mice ( fig. 2h ) .
moreover , both osteoclastic and osteoblastic parameters were altered by ovx to a similar extent in col1a1 - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice and control mice ( fig. 2i,j ) .
these results indicated that atf3 may not be implicated in osteoblastogenesis and bone homeostasis through its expression in osteoblasts in vivo .
atf3 deficiency abolishes rankl - induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro we evaluated whether atf3 regulates osteoclastogenesis through its expression in osteoclast lineages in vitro .
atf3fl / fl mice - derived bone marrow macrophages ( bmm ) were infected with a retrovirus expressing cre recombinase and subjected to differentiation by rankl , followed by tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( trap ) staining , actin ring formation assay , and pit assay .
atf3 expression was markedly repressed in bmm infected with a retrovirus expressing cre recombinase ( fig. 3a ) .
the number of trap positive multinucleated cells , area of pit formation , and the number of actin ring formation , were significantly decreased in atf3 - deleted bmm ( fig. 3b - e ) .
moreover , the expression of the osteoclast differentiation and fusion markers , transmembrane 7 superfamily member 4 ( dcstamp ) , cathepsin k ( ctsk ) and nfatc1 was markedly decreased in atf3 - deleted osteoclasts ( fig. 3f ) .
on the contrary , atf3 deficiency did not alter the area of pit formation , when the same number of mature osteoclasts was used for pit formation assay ( supplemental fig. 5 ) .
these results clearly show that atf3 positively regulates osteoclast differentiation rather than maturation in vitro .
to reveal the role of atf3 in osteoblasts on osteoclastogenesis , we performed co - culture experiments .
atf3fl / fl mice - derived osteoblasts were retrovirally transfected with cre recombinase and subsequent co - culture with wt mice - derived bmm , followed by trap staining .
a similar number of trap positive cells were generated irrespective of atf3 deficiency in osteoblasts ( supplemental fig. 6 ) .
jun dimerization protein 2 ( jdp2 ) , which is the closest relative of atf3 among ap - 1 family members , reportedly plays an important role during osteoclastogenesis through modulating nfatc1 activity and inhibits atf3 expression in fibroblasts and neutrophils2325 .
to examine whether jdp2 is implicated in atf3 expression during osteoclastogenesis , wt mice - derived bmms were retrovirally transfected with sh - jdp2 and subsequent rankl stimulation , followed by determination of atf3 expression during osteoclastogenesis ( at day 0 - day 4 ) .
atf3 expression was significantly higher in jdp2 - knockdown bmm at day 0 , 1 , 3 , and 4 , indicating a contribution of jdp2 in atf3 expression in osteoclasts ( supplemental fig. 7 ) .
atf3 deficiency represses rankl - induced cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo we focused on cell survival and proliferation of osteoclast precursors because of the observation that rankl induced an increase in osteoclast number in control mice , and its increase was significantly repressed in cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice , as shown in fig. 1j .
in line with our observation in vivo , it has been reported that rankl transiently increases cell proliferation of bmm prior to the triggering of the arrest of cell proliferation26 .
atf3fl / fl mice - derived bmm were infected with a retrovirus expressing cre recombinase and subsequently stimulated with rankl for the specified time periods , followed by determination of cell proliferation and cell survivability .
flow cytometric measurements after brdu incorporation revealed that rankl stimulation for 24 h ( but not for 8 h ) significantly increased the number of cells in the s - phase of control cells ( fig. 4a,c and supplemental fig. 8a ) .
in contrast , in atf3 - deleted bmm , the rankl - induced increase in the number of cells in the s - phase was markedly reduced ( fig. 4a,c ) .
the number of cells in the s - phase tended to decrease in atf3 - deleted bmm with pbs treatment , indicating that atf3 may be involved in basal cell proliferation in addition to the presence of rankl signaling .
on the contrary , atf3 deficiency did not affect the number of apoptotic cells in bmm irrespective of the presence or absence of rankl ( fig. 4b,d ) .
to determine whether this was true in vivo , gst - rankl fusion protein was administered to control and cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice , followed by determination of cell proliferation .
to more precisely determine cell proliferation of osteoclast precursors in vivo , the number of cells in the s - phase was analyzed in cd11blo / - ly6chicx3cr1 + cells because it has been previously shown that cd11blo / - ly6chicx3cr1 + cells in the bone marrow contain the majority of osteoclast precursor activity27 .
the ratio of cd11blo / - ly6chicx3cr1 + cells in bone marrow cells was significantly increased in control mice , but not in cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice 24 h after rankl injection ( fig. 5a,c ) .
the s - phase cd11blo / - ly6chicx3cr1 + cells of control mice were significantly increased 24 h ( but not 12 h ) after rankl administration , but its increase by rankl was markedly impaired in cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice - derived cells ( fig. 5b,d and supplemental fig. 8b ) .
moreover , cell proliferation of osteoclast precursors was determined in cfms + cells , which are known to have high capacity for differentiating into multinuclear osteoclasts28 .
as shown in cd11blo / - ly6chicx3cr1 + cells , rankl - induced increase in the s - phase cd11b + cfms + cells of control mice was markedly impaired in cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice - derived cells ( supplemental fig. 9 ) .
collectively , these findings indicate that atf3 deficiency attenuates rankl - induced proliferation of osteoclast precursor both in vitro and in vivo .
cyclin d1 is implicated in the atf3 deficiency - induced repression of osteoclast differentiation to elucidate the mechanism of atf3 regulation of rankl - induced proliferation of osteoclast precursors , the expression pattern of cell proliferation - related protein was determined in atf3 - deficient cells .
among these , cyclin d1 expression was markedly decreased in atf3 - deficient bmm , in addition to cyclin d3 to a lesser extent ( fig. 6a ) .
moreover , cyclin d1 mrna expression was significantly decreased in atf3 - deleted bmm ( fig. 6b ) .
although an atf / creb binding site was previously identified in the cyclin d1 promoter29 ( fig. 6c ) , the binding of atf3 to the site was detected to a lesser extent in either the presence or absence of rankl in bmm ( fig. 6c ) .
it has been previously reported that atf3 binds to the ap - 1 responsive site of cyclin d1 promoter , leading to its transcriptional activation in hepatocytes30 .
therefore , we examined whether atf3 binds to its site in bmm .
the recruitment of atf3 to the ap - 1 responsive site of cyclin d1 promoter was detected in bmm under the basal condition , and it was significantly increased by rankl ( fig. 6c ) .
finally , we determined the possibility of the implication of cyclin d1 in the repression of cell differentiation observed in atf3 - deficient bmm .
atf3fl / fl mice - derived bmm were infected with a retrovirus expressing cre recombinase and cyclin d1 and subsequently stimulated with rankl , followed by determination of trap positive multinucleated cells .
an impairment of osteoclastogenesis was almost completely rescued in retroviral transduction of cyclin d1 into atf3 - deleted bmm ( fig. 6d,e ) .
these results suggest that atf3 regulates osteoclast differentiation through the modulation of cyclin d1 - dependent cell proliferation ( fig. 6f ) .
discussion the essential relevance of the present findings is that the transcription factor atf3 regulates bone resorption and bone remodeling under the pathological condition through its expression in osteoclast precursors .
atf3 has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases16181931 .
the present study indicates the possibility of the implication of atf3 in metabolic bone diseases .
atf3 deficiency in osteoblasts did not alter bone volume and bone formation parameters in vivo under both pathological and physiological conditions .
although further in vivo examination should be conducted to completely exclude the possible involvement of atf3 in bone formation and bone remodeling through its expression in osteoblasts , atf3 would be a pivotal and specific transcription factor capable of regulating bone resorption and bone remodeling under the pathological condition through its expression in osteoclast lineages .
in the present study , cd11b - cre ; atf3fl / fl mice showed protection against bone loss and an increase in the number of osteoclasts induced by rankl administration .
the rankl - induced increase in cell proliferation was abolished in atf3 - deficient osteoclast precursors , both in vitro ( bmm ) and in vivo ( cd11blo / - ly6chicx3cr1 + cells and cd11b + cfms + cells in bone marrow cells ) , along with repression of cyclin d1 expression in bmm .
moreover , the introduction of cyclin d1 into atf3 - deficient osteoclast precursors almost completely rescued the impairment of osteoclastogenesis .
although further study should be conducted to determine whether osteoclast - specific deletion of cyclin d1 in mice could display protection from rankl - induced bone loss , the mechanism underlying the regulation by atf3 of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption appears to at least in part involve cyclin d1 - dependent proliferation of osteoclast precursors .
it was reported that rankl - induced osteoclastogenesis is regulated by cyclin - dependent protein kinases ( cdks ) and cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors ( ckis ) such as cdk6 or p21 / p273233 .
similarly , in the present study , we could not exclude the possibility that cdks and ckis , as well as another cyclin members , could contribute to the regulation of atf3 - dependent cell proliferation of osteoclast precursors and osteoclastogenesis .
atf3 has been shown to repress or activate the transcription of target genes , depending on various factors including cell type , binding sequences , or complex partners .
indeed , atf3 has been shown to repress cyclin d1 expression , possibly through its binding to the atf / creb binding site in chondrocytes , whereas it binds to the cyclin d1 ap - 1 binding site , leading to its transcriptional activation in hepatocytes3034 .
moreover , a c - fos / c - jun complex activates cyclin d1 promoter activity by binding to the ap - 1 binding site in response to growth factor signaling3536 , indicating the possible physical interaction between c - fos / c - jun and atf3 on the ap - 1 binding site of cyclin d1 promoter .
although the exact mechanism underlying the regulation by atf3 of cyclin d1 transcription remained unclear , the present study showed that atf3 transcriptionally regulated cyclin d1 expression though its binding to the ap - 1 binding site rather than atf / creb binding site in osteoclast precursors .
in conclusion , the results of the present study support the assertion that the transcription factor atf3 is functionally expressed by osteoclast precursors to promote cell proliferation required for osteoclastogenesis during bone resorption and remodeling under the pathological condition .
the novel player atf3 and rank - atf3 - cyclin d1 axis could thus be a future target for the discovery and development of a drug useful for the treatment and therapy of a variety of metabolic bone diseases relevant to abnormal proliferation of osteoclast precursors .

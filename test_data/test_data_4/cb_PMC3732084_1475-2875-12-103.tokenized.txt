background development and spread of plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin - based combination therapy ( act ) constitutes a major threat to recent global malaria control achievements .
surveillance of molecular markers could act as an early warning system of act - resistance before clinical treatment failures are apparent .
the aim of this study was to analyse temporal trends of established genotypes associated with artemether - lumefantrine tolerance / resistance before and after its deployment as first - line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in tanzania 2006 .
methods single nucleotide polymorphisms in the p. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 ( pfmdr1 ) n86y , y184f , d1246y and p. falciparum chloroquine transporter gene ( pfcrt ) k76t were analysed from dried blood spots collected during six consecutive studies from children with uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria in fukayosi village , bagamoyo district , tanzania , between 2004 - 2011 .
results there was a statistically significant yearly increase of pfmdr1 n86 , 184f , d1246 and pfcrt k76 between 2006 - 2011 from 14 % to 61 % ( yearly or = 1.38 [ 95 % ci 1.25 - 1.52 ] p < 0.0001 ) , 14 % to 35 % ( or = 1.17 [ 95 % ci 1.07 - 1.30 ] p = 0.001 ) , 54 % to 85 % ( or = 1.21 [ 95 % ci 1.03 - 1.42 ] p = 0.016 ) and 49 % to 85 % ( or = 1.33 [ 95 % ci 1.17 - 1.51 ] p < 0.0001 ) , respectively .
unlike for the pfmdr1 snp , a significant increase of pfcrt k76 was observed already between 2004 - 2006 , from 26 % to 49 % ( or = 1.68 [ 95 % ci 1.17 - 2.40 ] p = 0.005 ). from 2006 to 2011 the pfmdr1 nfd haplotype increased from 10 % to 37 % ( or = 1.25 [ 95 % ci 1.12 - 1.39 ] p < 0.0001 ) , whereas the yyy haplotype decreased from 31 % to 6 % ( or = 0.73 [ 95 % ci 0.56 - 0.98 ] p = 0.018 ) .
all 390 successfully analysed samples had one copy of the pfmdr1 gene .
conclusion the temporal selection of molecular markers associated with artemether - lumefantrine tolerance / resistance may represent an early warning sign of impaired future drug efficacy .
this calls for stringent surveillance of artemether - lumefantrine efficacy in tanzania and emphasizes the importance of molecular surveillance as a complement to standard in vivo trials .
plasmodium falciparum malaria pfmdr1 pfcrt artemether - lumefantrine lumefantrine drug resistance tanzania background modern malaria control relies primarily on sustained efficacy of artemisinin - based combination therapy ( act ) .
reports of artemisinin tolerant / resistant plasmodium falciparum from southeast asia [ 1 - 3 ] constitute , therefore , a major threat to recent global malaria control achievements .
within the african continent there has to date been no clear evidence of artemisinin resistance , but an increased parasite positivity rate on day 1 after initiation of act treatment has been reported from kenya [ 4 ] .
act is a combination of an artemisinin derivative , which rapidly reduces the parasite load , and a long - acting partner drug that kills the remaining parasites and suggestively protects the artemisinin component from resistance development .
during clearance of the long - acting partner drug re - infecting parasites are exposed to slowly declining drug concentrations during several weeks .
this phenomenon , which is of particular importance in high transmission areas , may be the starting point for development of tolerance / resistance towards the long - acting partner drug .
this could initially result in a shorter post - treatment prophylactic effect and eventually reduce the act to an artemisinin derivative monotherapy .
the most commonly used act in africa is artemether - lumefantrine .
it has been deployed as first - line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in tanzania since 2006 .
artemether - lumefantrine has shown to be highly efficacious with pcr - corrected cure rates exceeding 95 % [ 5 - 7 ] .
however , artemether - lumefantrine has been associated with selection of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in genes associated with anti - malarial drug resistance among re - infections , as compared with baseline parasite characteristics [ 8 - 10 ] .
the main snps are p. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 ( pfmdr1 ) n86 , 184f and d1246 [ 8,9 ] and the p. falciparum chloroquine transporter gene ( pfcrt ) k76 allele [ 10 ] .
this highlights the need of close surveillance of molecular markers as an early warning system of development and spread of anti - malarial drug resistance and an important tool for insights into drug resistance development .
the aim of this study was to assess temporal trends of molecular markers associated with anti - malarial drug resistance in a rural tanzanian village before and after wide scale deployment of artemether - lumefantrine as first - line treatment of uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria .

discussion this study provides evidence for a continuous selection of molecular markers associated with artemether - lumefantrine tolerance / resistance in the local p. falciparum population in fukayosi village , bagamoyo district , tanzania , occurring after the introduction of this act as first - line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in 2006 .
the results support previous observations of pfmdr1 n86 selection in gabon , kenya and mozambique [ 19 - 21 ] as well as selection of both pfmdr1 n86 and 184f in korogwe , tanzania [ 22 ] , and the pfmdr1 n86 , 184f , d1246 haplotype in mozambique [ 23 ] following wide scale deployment of artemether - lumefantrine .
however , the present report adds substantially to the evidence base being more comprehensive both with regards to number of patients and genetic markers analysed , and importantly with a longer duration of follow - up. interestingly the selection of pfcrt k76 started already prior to the introduction of artemether - lumefantrine in bagamoyo district .
this probably represents an effect of the withdrawal of chloroquine as first - line treatment in 2001 , consistent with observations from malawi where withdrawal of chloroquine resulted in a fast re - expansion of a diverse chloroquine - susceptible pfcrt k76 population [ 24 ] .
thus , the herein observed increase in pfcrt k76 may not necessarily only be due to the introduction of artemether - lumefantrine , but could also , at least partly , be explained by the withdrawal of chloroquine and / or other factors , such as parasite fitness and transmission intensity [ 24 - 26 ] .
conversely , no selection of pfmdr1 n86 , 184f , d1246 occurred prior to introduction of artemether - lumefantrine in the study area .
the selection of these snps seen after 2006 is therefore unlikely driven by the withdrawal of chloroquine .
there are evidences that exposure of artemether - lumefantrine is the main contributor behind the observed selection of pfmdr1 n86 , 184f , d1246 snps and that it plays a role also for selection of pfcrt k76 .
these evidences include the previously reported specific lumefantrine - driven selection among re - infections during follow up after artemether - lumefantrine treatment [ 9,10 ] , in vitro findings [ 27 ] and a recent study conducted in tanzania , which shows that the selection of n86 , 184f and d1246 after artemether - lumefantrine treatment in vivo is significantly associated with the ability to withstand higher lumefantrine concentrations [ 15 ] .
in this context it is also worth noting that there are studies suggesting that both the artemisinin - derivatives and lumefantrine select for the same molecular markers [ 28,29 ] .
this , together with the recent evidence from southeast asia that p. falciparum is able to develop artemisinin tolerance / resistance , is of particular concern as it could result in an additive or even synergistic selection of molecular markers of anti - malarial drug resistance in the parasite population .
it is of note that the blood slide positivity rate in study 5 was lower ( 17 %) compared with the mean for all other studies combined ( 53 %) .
this may be due to that study 5 was conducted during october - january , when the malaria transmission is relatively low .
however , this did not appear to have influenced the snp prevalences .
furthermore , it is important to underline that clinical efficacy of artemether - lumefantrine remained high in the study area with pcr - corrected cure rate > 95 % in 2007 [ 7 ] .
nevertheless , in an era when the number of malaria patients is slowly declining , standard in vivo trials are increasingly difficult and costly to conduct .
in this context , molecular surveillance may play an important role to detect selection of genetic markers associated with act tolerance / resistance in the local p. falciparum population over time .
conclusions increased prevalence of pfmdr1 n86 , 184f , d1246 and pfcrt k76 was observed in the parasite population after deployment of artemether - lumefantrine as first - line treatment for uncomplicated malaria .
the pfmdr1 haplotype nfd increased significantly at the cost of yyy and yyd .
the temporal selection of molecular markers associated with artemether - lumefantrine tolerance / resistance may represent an early warning sign of impaired future drug efficacy .
this calls for stringent surveillance of artemether - lumefantrine efficacy in tanzania and emphasizes the importance of molecular surveillance as a complement to standard in vivo trials .

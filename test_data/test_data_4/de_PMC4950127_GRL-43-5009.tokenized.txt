abstract recent gas flux measurements have shown that strombolian explosions are often followed by periods of elevated flux , or " gas codas ," with durations of order a minute .
here we present uv camera data from 200 events recorded at stromboli volcano to constrain the nature of these codas for the first time , providing estimates for combined explosion plus coda so2 masses of =~ 18 - 225 kg. numerical simulations of gas slug ascent show that substantial proportions of the initial gas mass can be distributed into a train of " daughter bubbles " released from the base of the slug , which we suggest , generate the codas , on bursting at the surface .
this process could also cause transitioning of slugs into cap bubbles , significantly reducing explosivity .
this study is the first attempt to combine high temporal resolution gas flux data with numerical simulations of conduit gas flow to investigate volcanic degassing dynamics .

1 introduction strombolian explosions are the archetypal events which occur every few minutes [ ripepe et al. , 2002 ] at stromboli volcano ( aeolian islands , italy ) and are thought to result from the ascent and bursting of gas slugs [ e.g. , chouet et al. , 1974 ; blackburn et al. , 1976 ; seyfried and freundt , 2000 , and references therein ] .
thus , the study of slug flow dynamics is pivotal to understanding the processes driving strombolian eruptions , and analytical and computational fluid dynamic ( cfd ) models have been developed to help interpret geophysical signals [ e.g. , james et al. , 2004 , 2008 ; o'brien and bean , 2008 ; del bello et al. , 2012 ]. with the advent of ultraviolet ( uv ) cameras [ e.g. , mori and burton , 2006 ; bluth et al. , 2007 ; tamburello et al. , 2011 ] , gas fluxes can now be measured at sufficiently high temporal resolutions to also provide insight into slug fluid dynamics .
such data have recently enabled the identification of gas flux coda for the first time , which are periods of elevated emissions following individual strombolian events [ tamburello et al. , 2012 ] .
coda are potentially produced from trains of " daughter bubbles " that have been released from , and subsequently follow , the base of ascending slugs .
here we use cfd models of slug ascent and daughter bubble production as a first step to quantify this process and assess its wider implications for conduit fluid dynamics .
the morphology and behavior of ascending gas slugs depend on parameters which include conduit radius , magma density , and magma viscosity .
notably , magma viscosity and conduit radius also play key roles in determining the form and the degree of turbulence in the wakes that follow slugs [ e.g. , campos and guedes de carvalho , 1988 ] .
for long slugs , wake form has been shown to be a function of the dimensionless inverse viscosity , n f , which represents a ratio of external forces to internal viscous forces : ( 1 ) nf = rhommug2rc3,where rho m is the liquid density , mu is liquid viscosity , g is acceleration due to gravity , and r c is tube radius [ campos and guedes de carvalho , 1988 ; nogueira et al. , 2006 ] .
for n f values < 500 slug wakes are closed ( recirculatory ) and axisymmetric , while for values > 500 , symmetry is lost and wakes become increasingly open and turbulent nogueira et al. , 2006 ]. with sufficient wake turbulence , gas can be removed from the main slug by bubbles being sheared from its base [ wallis , 1969 ; campos and guedes de carvalho , 1988 ] .
the resulting daughter bubbles can then either become entrained within the slug wake and subsequently reincorporated back into the slug [ campos and guedes de carvalho , 1988 ] or can be ejected from the wake , to rise independently from , and behind , the main slug [ e.g. , bouche et al. , 2010 ] .
to the authors' knowledge , fernandes et al .
[ 1983 ] detail the only previous attempt to quantify gas mass loss from the base of slugs but did not consider the subsequent escape of the gas from the wake .
in the volcanic literature , daughter bubble production has been discussed briefly [ e.g. , james et al. , 2006 ; suckale et al. , 2010 ; llewellin et al. , 2014 ] , but the implications for strombolian eruptions have yet to be quantified .
using values of 2700 kg m3 for magma density [ e.g. , vergniolle and brandeis , 1996 ; metrich et al. , 2001 ] , 200 - 500 pa s - 1 for magma viscosity [ vergniolle et al. , 1996 ] , and 1 - 3 m for conduit radius [ e.g. , harris and stevenson , 1997 ; delle donne and ripepe , 2012 ] to represent the system at stromboli , equation ( 1 ) gives n f values of 47 - 621 , suggesting that daughter bubble production could be possible .
therefore , motivated by the observed gas coda signals in uv camera measurements of eruptions at stromboli , we report here on the use of cfd models to explore the potential effects of daughter bubble generation on strombolian eruptions .
this is the first reported attempt to combine high temporal resolution volcanic gas flux data with numerical simulations of gas flow in conduits to investigate the dynamics of volcanic degassing .
2 uv camera measurements of so2 flux we first characterized and quantified the gas release from a total of 200 events , which were categorized into two classes : vent 1 events , numbering 120 , which arose from the craters ( mostly the south east crater ; sec ) , and vent 2 events , numbering 80 and emanating from a hornito on the edge of the sec .
vent 1 events were relatively ash free , included the ejection of bombs , and were associated with very long period ( vlp ) seismic signals , while vent 2 events released gas only and did not always produce a vlp signal ( see figure 1e for vlp during a vent 2 event ) .
events of both types occurred every =~ 2 - 10 min , with impulsive gas release lasting =~ 10 - 30 s in each case .
the gas flux measurements were performed on 11 , 13 , 21 , 22 , 23 , and 25 june , and 3 july 2014 , using the permanent uv camera network installed by the universita di palermo and universita di firenze , within the framework of the fp7 - erc project " bridge. " the cameras imaged the entire crater terrace , and gas fluxes were determined =~ 50 m above the vents .

figure 1 shows example integrated column amounts of so2 and gas velocities ( calculated using optical flow algorithms [ e.g. , horn and schunck , 1981 ; peters et al. , 2015 ]) , which were used to calculate so2 fluxes .
the data used to characterize each event were taken from the base of initial flux peak until measured flux values returned to background levels .
so2 masses for the explosions were calculated by integrating underneath the peaks of each flux trace associated with the initial impulsive gas release ( see movie s1 and text s2 for further details ) and , for coda masses , until flux levels returned to background levels ; see text s2 for examples ( also see figure 1 , kantzas et al. [ 2010 ] , and tamburello et al .
[ 2011 , 2012 ] , and references therein , for full details on uv camera calibration and image processing ) .
to facilitate comparison of all measured vent 1 and 2 events , the explosive traces were normalized by subtracting each event 's minimum value and then dividing by the maximum .
the normalized data show a range of characteristics , and events can be visually separated into a number of distinct families ( figure 2 ) .
each event shows an initial peak in flux , followed by a flux coda [ e.g. , tamburello et al. , 2012 ] .
additional observed features include a variable number of subsequent flux peaks within the coda , of differing magnitudes and coda durations .

all events have been normalized by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the maximum .
the black horizontal bar at the top of the plots represents maximum event duration , while the thick black line traced on all subfigures represents a characteristic event .
see supporting information table s6 for details on how events were categorized .
in general , so2 masses were an order of magnitude larger for vent 1 events than for the vent 2 events , in both the main explosion ( figure 1h ) and coda ( figures 1f and 1g ) components ( see table s1 in the supporting information for further detail and for total gas masses calculated using the gas chemical compositions from burton et al. [ 2007 ]) .
the latter compositional data pertain to vent 1 type activity alone ; therefore , the vent 2 total masses must be considered best estimates on the basis of available data .
for the vent 2 events , with increasing explosion mass , a higher proportion of the overall released mass is contained within the explosion ( figure 1h ) .
for vent 1 events , a similar relationship exists , but this appears somewhat skewed by events with rather low coda masses ( figure 1h ) .
3 cfd modeling of slug flow and gas flux to explore the potential for daughter bubble production as a source for gas coda , slug ascent was simulated using the computational fluid dynamics package ansys fluent ( r ) .
a series of 3 - d models were constructed based on a quarter pipe section ( e.g. , as in james et al .
[ 2008 ]) uniformly meshed with 0.05 m3 to 0.1 m3 cells ( adjusted to keep computation times reasonable and small enough to resolve the falling film thickness ) .
in each case , the volume - of - fluid method , with implicit body force enabled , was employed in a pressure - based solver , and thermal effects were also simulated .
an explicit time - stepping method was used with the time - step fixed between 10 - 2 and 10 - 3 s , and a maximum courant number of 0.25 .
a constant pressure upper boundary condition was used to represent the conduit at a depth of =~ 100 m within the magma ( 2,750,025 pa ) , and a zero - flow bottom boundary condition was imposed .
two fluids were simulated : magma ( with temperature of 1000degreesc [ e.g. , harris and stevenson , 1997 ] , density of 2700 kg m3 [ e.g. , metrich et al. , 2001 ] , and surface tension of 0.4 n m2 ) and water vapor ( for the slug , with thermal conductivity of 0.0261 w m - 1k - 1 and a ratio of specific heats of 1.4 ) .
water vapor is the only compressible phase within the model and was chosen for the slug composition , as it is the dominant species in the volcanic gas chemistry ( with 83 % of the molar weight [ burton et al. , 2007 ] .
ansys fluent ( r ) has previously been shown capable of modeling full 3 - d slug flow and daughter bubble production [ e.g. , taha and cui , 2006 ; araujo et al. , 2012 ] at engineering scales .
to provide confidence in our quarter pipe model , a number of validation runs were performed ( tc1 - tc5 ) to ensure that it replicated the five regimes of behavior reported in taha and cui [ 2006 ] over n f values of 84 - 1528 .
to reproduce the conditions of taha and cui [ 2006 ] , these simulations used a pipe of radius 9.5 mm and length 190 mm , with liquids of surface tension 0.064 n m2 , densities ranging 1129 to 1223 kg m - 3 , and kinematic viscosities 9.7 x 10 - 5 to 5.47 x 10 - 6 m2 s - 1 .
dry air was used for the slug .
supporting information movie s2 demonstrates our model validation by showing matching wake features ( i.e. , an increasingly closed wake on decreasing n f value and a commensurate decrease in turbulence in the wake area ) and onset of daughter bubble production for each of the n f values used by taha and cui [ 2006 ] .
following validation , 3 - d stromboli - specific model runs ( s1 - s12 ) were implemented for a range of magma viscosities ( 200 , 300 , 400 , and 500 pa s - 1 ) and conduit radii ( 1 , 2 , and 3 m ) , i.e. , nf = 48 - 621 [ e.g. , vergniolle et al. , 1996 ; harris and stevenson , 1997 ; delle donne and ripepe , 2012 ] .
the initial slug and conduit lengths were set to =~ 2.5 and 10 times the conduit radius , respectively ( e.g. , for rc = 2 m , the conduit length was 20 m ) .
these parameters were chosen to allow the flow regime to develop while minimizing compute time , and by simulating slugs at depths =~ 100 m , the effects of gas expansion did not substantially contribute to liquid motions .
the magma density and viscosity values chosen here represent bulk column values ; deviations from these values could occur through the presence of bubbles and crystals , with an increase in either of these acting to reduce nf. the models were run in parallel on the university of sheffield linux high - performance computing cluster , with a total simulation time of < 2 weeks .
in five of these models , the production of daughter bubbles ( see table s2 for summary ) was observed from the base of the rising slugs , to varying degrees ( figure 3 and supporting information movie s3 ) .
these mass loss rates are stable for the duration of simulations , after a short initial start - up transient ( figure 4 ) , and ranged between =~ 1.2 and 14.2 kg s - 1 between the different models ( figure 5a ) .
for n f values > 330 ( models s5 , s9 , and s10 ) , slugs were observed to separate into four individual bubbles on initiation ( see figure 3 ) ; this occurred for slugs that were wider than the maximum bubble diameter determined by theoretical considerations of bubble nose instability [ suckale et al. , 2010 ] and is likely to be an artifact of the transient and unphysical conditions at model initiation ( i.e. , static fluid surrounding a stationary bubble ) .
the possibility that daughter bubble production was triggered by similar transients in other models was tested by simulating a stable , non - daughter bubble producing slug ( at n f =~ 100 , with mu = 1200 pa s and rc = 3 m ) for =~ 10 s ( i.e. , so that a flow regime had fully developed ) , then decreasing the magma viscosity to 400 pa s , to give n f = 310 .
this resulted in a transition to daughter bubble production with rate similar to that generated if the model had originally been started with n f = 310 ( model s11 ) .

all models were captured at 10 s from initiation .
daughter bubble production is observed in several of the model runs .

( b ) s11 and s12 with r c = 3 m. dashed lines indicate linear best fit representing average mass loss rates ( plotted against nf in figure 5a ) .
figure 5 ( a ) the relationship between gas mass lost from slugs per second and the dimensionless inverse viscosity , n f , for daughter bubble producing model runs shaded region represents n f values for simulations which did not produce daughter bubbles .
( b and c ) the depths from which a slug must rise to generate coda masses representing the 1st quartile , median , 3rd quartile , and maximum values of the measured distributions at stromboli ( figures 1f and 1g ) , for vent 1 and vent 2 events , respectively .
onset of daughter bubble production in our stromboli models occurred at lower n f values than in our validation models and in previous work [ e.g. , nogueira et al. , 2006 ; taha and cui , 2006 ] .
the differences between the simulations are dominated by scale ( from mm to m ) , surface tension ( 0.064 n m2 and 0.4 n m2 ) , and dynamic viscosity ( 2 to 3 orders of magnitude difference ) .
it is possible therefore that nf does not fully capture all the physics required to parameterize daughter bubble production , and caution is required if extrapolating laboratory - scale results to volcanic scenarios .
4 discussion all the events measured at stromboli had gas coda of =~ 20 - 160 s in duration , which in some cases contained post - explosive peaks in emission ( e.g. , figures 2c - 2f ) .
as stromboli persistently degasses , it is conceivable that the coda could result from interactions between the rising slug and gas already contained within the conduit [ gaudin et al. , 2014 ] ; for example , a pressure drop in the magma below a gas slug could allow additional gas exsolution in the wake region .
if slugs are produced from regions of foam collapse or ascending pockets of gas saturated magma , bubble trains could also potentially be produced from " leftover " bubbles following slug formation .
variability and flux peaks within coda could potentially be caused by the close rise and burst of independent bubbles or slugs , by gas dispersal processes in the upper conduit and atmosphere , or by complexities in slug burst due to heterogeneities in magma rheology [ del bello et al. , 2015 ; capponi et al. , 2016 ] .
this said , given the efficiency of gas transfer from slugs into daughter bubbles demonstrated within our simulations , we do suggest that daughter bubble production could play a key role in driving coda generation in strombolian volcanism .
our field measurements show that coda gas masses are =~ 53 - 75 % of total event gas masses ( i.e. , explosion plus coda ) for vent 1 events , and =~ 70 - 84 % for vent 2 events ( figure 1 , using data between the first and third quartiles of the distribution ) .
given the range of mass loss rates calculated from the simulations , =~ 1.2 - 14.2 kg s - 1 , it is entirely plausible that coda on the order of those observed in our field measurements could be generated .
we note that the gas mass loss rates for the stromboli simulations do not show a straightforward relationship with nf ( figure 5a ) , further suggesting that work is warranted to characterize the processes behind slug mass loss rates .
future 3 - d models will also enable inclined conduit scenarios to be investigated , which would be of particular relevance to stromboli , where the conduit is at 40degrees from the vertical [ chouet et al. , 2003 ] .
daughter bubble production has interesting volcanological implications beyond the production of gas coda .
under conditions of sufficiently high nf for daughter bubble production and shedding from the wake region , rising slugs will effectively dissipate during ascent .
in this case , slugs may only substantially occur in the shallow portions of a conduit , where decompressive gas expansion can outweigh volumetric loss from daughter bubble production .
at greater depths , ascending slug - sized gas pockets will dissipate until they transition to a stable morphology , such as cap bubbles , at which point the effective increase in falling film thickness and decrease in ascent velocity will reduce wake turbulence and hence mass loss [ wallis , 1969 ] .
furthermore , the release of daughter bubbles would add significant numbers of smaller bubbles to the conduit , some of which would coalesce ( e.g. , see models s7 and s12 in the supporting information movie s2 ) and , over greater flow distances than modeled here , could generate larger bubbles , providing an explanation for the post - explosive peaks in the flux data ( figure 2 ) .
if slugs are sufficiently large , and a constant slug mass loss rate during ascent is assumed , then coda gas masses could be used to infer initial slug depths ( figures 5b and 5c ) .
if measured coda masses were generated from the smaller gas mass loss rates calculated in the simulations , then ( using slug rise speeds of =~ 1.97 - 2.54 m s - 1 , see supporting information s1 for details ) slugs could ascend from previously suggested formation depths of ~ 3 km [ burton et al. , 2007 ; chouet et al. , 2008 ] while larger mass loss rates would limit slug flow to depths < 1000 m ( figure 5b ) .
the vent 2 coda masses are suggestive of much shallower source depths , as indicated in figure 5c , with the higher mass loss rates corresponding to depths < 100 m. this analysis , along with other characteristic gas mass differences between vent 1 and vent 2 events ( figure 1h ) , suggests that the gas slugs driving each process may arise from different source regions or processes .
however , the strong event variability , particularly for the vent 1 explosions ( figures 1g , and h ) , precludes more detailed interpretation from the current data set , and we encourage coda measurement to be integrated into longer - term monitoring campaigns , with a view to substantially increasing the number of observations .
5 conclusions using uv camera measurements of so2 gas fluxes from strombolian explosions , we demonstrate that a significant proportion of gas from each event can be contained within a flux coda that follows the initial explosively erupted gas mass .
we suggest , supported by evidence from cfd simulations , that the observed flux coda could be generated by the production of daughter bubbles and the formation of a daughter bubble train that follows a rising slug .
the production of daughter bubbles is demonstrated to vary with the inverse viscosity of the system and potentially with conduit radius .
slugs of insufficient initial mass can dissipate into cap bubbles and a trailing bubble train prior to reaching the surface .
this allows for the intriguing possibility that , in some systems , slug morphology can only be sustained in near - surface regions where depressurisation - driven gas expansion [ james et al. , 2008 ] exceeds gas volume loss to daughter bubbles .

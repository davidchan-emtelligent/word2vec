origin dna melting is an essential process in the various domains of life .
the replication fork helicase unwinds dna ahead of the replication fork , providing single - stranded dna templates for the replicative polymerases .
the replication fork helicase is a ring shaped - assembly that unwinds dna by a steric exclusion mechanism in most dna replication systems .
while one strand of dna passes through the central channel of the helicase ring , the second dna strand is excluded from the central channel .
thus , the origin , or initiation site for dna replication , must melt during the initiation of dna replication to allow for the helicase to surround a single - dna strand .
while this process is largely understood for bacteria and eukaryotic viruses , less is known about how origin dna is melted at eukaryotic cellular origins .
this review describes the current state of knowledge of how genomic dna is melted at a replication origin in bacteria and eukaryotes .
we propose that although the process of origin melting is essential for the various domains of life , the mechanism for origin melting may be quite different among the different dna replication initiation systems .
dna helicase dna replication initiation protein - dna interaction dnaa large t antigen e1 helicase mcm2 - 7 melting 1 .
review of bacterial replication initiator dnaa like every other organism , bacteria must replicate their dna in order to produce viable offspring .
however , bacteria cannot infinitely replicate , meaning there must be a tight regulation of this process .
the fact that replication does not just start and pause indicates that there is a lot of regulation on the initiation of chromosome replication .
dnaa , the key initiator protein among almost all bacteria , is a highly conserved protein and is the driver of the system in which dna replication initiation is regulated .
this protein has been studied extensively and understood through the escherichia coli model .
2. dnaa - orisome structure dnaa is a key protein in the initiation of bacterial replication ( figure 1 ) .
bound to high - and low - affinity sites at the initiation sequence , oric , dnaa is a highly conserved protein among all bacteria that comprises the dna - protein complex termed the orisome , which triggers the initiation of chromosome replication .
oric dna is not bare throughout the cell cycle , but instead has bound dnaa to three high - affinity sites ( left to right : r1 , r2 , r4 ) .
these three dnaa sites , along with oric bending protein fis , set a nucleosome - like conformation in the origin that has been suggested to prevent replication initiation ( figure 2 ) [ 1 ] .
fis is not necessary for viability , however , the lack of fis binding results in asynchronous replication in rapidly growing cells .
this is due to the binding of dnaa to low affinity sites at a lower concentration than what is normally required , since there is no fis protein to inhibit dnaa binding [ 2 ] .
additionally , this conformation keeps the dna double - stranded until the appropriate replication - promoting proteins bind and separate the two strands .
the review by leonard and grimwade [ 1 ] discusses that these replication - promoting proteins include additional dnaa and another dna bending protein , integration host factor ( ihf ) .
upon accumulation of a sufficient level of dnaa - atp , the active form of dnaa , fis will be displaced and ihf will bind , along with dnaa , to low affinity sites between r1 and r2 , and r2 and r4 [ 3 ] .
ihf has been shown to be nonessential for the assembly of a functional orisome , however , this loss of ihf results in perturbed replication initiation [ 1 ] .
the viability of cells lacking ihf binding is most likely due to the flexibility of the dna between r1 and r5m .
although the exact mechanism of the displacement of this initiator inhibition is unclear , a recent study has shown that atp - bound dnaa , as opposed to adp - bound dnaa , experiences a conformational change within domains i - iii that enhances its ability to bind to low affinity sites within oric as well as cooperatively bind to already bound dnaa molecules [ 4 ] .
once a threshold concentration of dnaa - atp is achieved in the cell , fis can successfully be displaced and the inhibitory complex can progress to an active one .
dnase i footprinting studies have suggested that dna wraps around the dnaa oligomer once bound [ 5 ] .
as illustrated in figure 1 , the function of each domain has been determined via reverse genetics : dnaa recruitment ( i ) , dna binding ( iv ) , oligomerization ( i , iii ) , atp binding ( iii ) , and helicase loading ( i , iii ) [ 1 ]. between domains iii and iv is an amphipathic region that is involved in binding to the inner membrane of the cell [ 6 ] .
additionally , domain ii serves as a flexible linker , aligning domain i with domains iii + iv [ 4 ] .
3. dna conformation the oric dna contains multiple sites of dnaa binding in which specific binding is required for duplex unwinding ( figure 3 ). between the three high affinity sites mentioned in the above paragraph are low affinity dnaa sites ( r5m , tau2 , i1 , and i2 , respectively , between r1 and r2 ; c3 , c2 , i3 , and c1 , respectively , between r2 and r4 ) [ 3 ] , which become dnaa bound just before origin melting .
the left half of oric ( r1 - i2 ) and right half of oric ( r2 - r4 ) have opposite orientations , with both oriented inward of oric ( towards each other ) [ 3 ] .
kaur et al. demonstrated that the loss of any two high affinity sites resulted in the loss of oric function , while the loss of any single high affinity site resulted in a functional oric with perturbed initiation timing , with an r4 mutation being the most significant [ 3 ] .
the loss of r2 showed the least significant impact , implying that r2 may be a redundant site or may stabilize the oligomers from r1 and r4 .
the loss of any single high affinity site rendered the cell dependent on both fis and ihf binding for a functional oric .
when either r1 or r4 was deleted , r2 was shown to be capable of nucleating a dnaa oligomer , although a higher concentration of dnaa was required .
less dnaa was detected in the right half of oric in r4 mutants , supporting the importance of r4 [ 2 ] .
additionally , it was shown that e. coli mutants with a deletion in the entire right half or oric ( r2 - r4 ) are still viable under slow growth conditions .
however , with sensitivity to rich media and other rapid growth conditions , it is possible that the right half of oric has evolved to support multi - forked replication [ 7 ]. with these data on alternative methods for pre - rc formation , the minimum requirements for origin melting can be further investigated and understood with greater complexity .
the dna unwinding element is an at - rich region towards the left of oric that has less helical stability than the rest of oric dna .
dna unwinding element ( due ) consists of three regions ( l , m , r ) 13 - mer repeats [ 1 ] .
the due is the first piece of dna to unwind in replication initiation [ 8 ] , with evidence supporting initiation of melting beginning with the l - region [ 9 ] .
kowalski and eddy have demonstrated that by deleting the l - 13mer and replacing it with a dissimilar sequence , its helical instability , rather than its specific sequence , is essential for origin function and duplex unwinding .
meanwhile , the sequence of the r - 13mer is the most evolutionarily conserved of the three segments , suggesting a role for the r - 13mer in specific protein recognition [ 10 ] .
an increase in net negative supercoiling ( a general undertwist in the dna has been shown in more efficient e. coli initiation , indicating that this chromosomal topology is preferred for replication initiation [ 11 ] .
the flanking gene gida introduces negative supercoiling to the left of the due , which helps further destabilize the already less thermodynamically stable at - rich due [ 11 ] .
supporting this , maximal gida transcription occurs before initiation .
additionally , magnan and bates discuss in their review the importance of positive supercoiling in regulating oric transcription [ 11 ] .
the positive supercoiling to the right of due is regulated by the flanking gene mioc , with maximal transcription immediately after initiation .
while gida and mioc are both dispensable , it is possible that they help drive initiation under suboptimal conditions [ 11 ] .
kaur et al. tested for the conformation of oric pre - melting , and developed a model in which oric forms a constrained loop by interactions of the n - termini of high affinity - bound dnaa , and this loop and repression of active low affinity sites is assisted by fis binding ( figure 2 ) [ 3 ] .
it is possible that this pre - initiation complex causes a reduction of negative supercoiling adjacent to the due , and further research is needed to support this .
recent research has found a dnaa - trio , which consists of a repeating trinucleotide motif , beginning with 3 ' - gat - 5 ' , which lies between the at - rich due and the gc rich region ( which is adjacent to the dnaa boxes ) ( figure 3 ) [ 12 ] .
these newer findings will be discussed in greater detail later on .
4. initiator mechanism dnaa contains various aaa + ( atpases associated with various cellular activities ) motif sequences which provide a range of functions , including dnaa - dnaa binding [ 13 ] and dnaa - ssdna ( single - stranded dna ) binding [ 14 ] .
dnaa bound to oric high affinity dna boxes , via its domain iv helix - turn - helix motif [ 4 ] , nucleates by binding atp - dnaa at adjacent low affinity sites .
interestingly , one method of regulation of this step is through a chromosome - membrane protein tether .
bound to an array of operator sequences on the chromosome up to 1 mb away from oric , this tether is proposed to inhibit dnaa binding to dna by reducing the net negative supercoiling [ 15 ] , although this mechanism is not quite yet understood .
dnaa - atp is required for effective binding to low affinity sites and dnaa oligomer formation [ 4 ] , yet dnaa cannot always be bound to atp .
examining the crystal structure of dnaa bound to ssdna revealed four dnaa protomers per oligomer , forming a right hand spiral around a single strand of the duplex dna [ 14 ] .
the dnaa oligomer formation from r1 and r4 inwards towards r2 [ 3 ] is mediated by the arg285 residue within domain iii , which is oriented inward towards r2 for both the right and left half of oric [ 13 ] .
these arg285 fingers stimulate subcomplex formation by binding the atp nucleotide of the next dnaa monomer , eventually forming a dnaa oligomer .
this study also found that the arg285 finger of r1 - box - bound dnaa is crucial for due unwinding and single - stranded dna unwinding element ( ssdue ) binding , where the same residue of r4 - box - bound dnaa plays a necessary role in dnab helicase loading .
the interaction between dnaa monomers facilitates a conformational change in the bound strand of dna , stretching the contacted strand and disrupting the base pairs of the thermodynamically unstable due [ 14 ] .
once this region of oric unwinds , origin melting is enhanced by binding of the dnaa box - bound dnaa filaments to the partially melted region of oric dna .
dnaa forms a helical filament around the ssdna , where each protomer binds three nucleotides via two pairs of helices , alpha 3 / alpha 4 and alpha 5 / alpha 6 , which line the inner channel of this protein assembly [ 14 ] .
additionally , this conformation prevents reannealing of the two strands of dna .
once this conformation is set , as visualized in figure 4 , dnaa stabilizes the partially melted origin by nucleating from the already bound dnaa , forming dynamic filaments on the ssdna monomer by monomer in a 3 ' - 5 ' directionality [ 16 ] .
while the details of this mechanism have been widely unknown , a recent study has identified a dnaa - trio motif within the ssdna , which is recognized by the dnaa box - bound dnaa [ 12 ] , facilitating filament formation on the ssdna via the domain iii initiator specific motif ( ism ) initiator specific motif [ 14 ] .
according to the study conducted by richardson et al. , the box - bound dnaa recognizes a 3 ' - gat - 5 ' sequence , with some variability between the first and third nucleotide , but a highly conserved second adenine nucleotide [ 12 ] .
at this point , dnaa will nucleate across the next few dnaa - trios and into the due .
upon filament formation and further duplex melting , dnaa will load dnab via domain i and domain iii interactions , initiating the formation of the prepriming complex ( figure 4 , [ 17 ]) .
5. large t - antigen and e1 helicases mechanisms of origin melting can be derived from the structural analysis of the dna tumor virus simian virus 40 ( sv40 ) and papillomavirus .
specifically , sv40 utilizes its large t antigen ( ltag ) to initially separate and continually unwind double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) in host cells , and the papillomavirus enlists e1 to do the same .
due to eukaryotic similarities , such as homohexameric domains and beta hairpin loops , results derived from these models may be applicable to the understanding of eukaryotic melting processes .
unlike replication in eukaryotes , melting with initiators sv40 and e1 is performed through cooperation of only a handful of protein domains compared to the variety of protein complexes often necessary to facilitate eukaryotic dna replication .
this lack of complexity yet abundance of shared homology has allowed recent studying of sv40 and e1 to elucidate potential mechanisms for eukaryotic origin melting .
6. structure of ltag and the core ori melting of eukaryotic dna is thought to require a variety of protein factors which work together to manipulate dsdna , ultimately separating the two strands via mechanical force .
due to the complexity of the eukaryotic cellular machinery , researchers have turned to more simplistic models of initiation , such as the large t antigen .
ltag is a double hexameric protein complex produced by the sv40 virus which is solely responsible for melting of sv40 viral dna origins , as well as helicase activity once replication forks have been established .
three distinguishable domains compartmentalize these actions , the first of which is known as the origin binding domain ( obd ) .
the obd of ltag has been shown to bind both dsdna and ssdna [ 18 ] much like the dna binding domains of dnaa [ 12 ] .
many similarly structured dna binding domains ( dbds ) of eukaryotic and prokaryotic replication machinery bind ssdna specifically , such as eukaryotic replication protein a ( rpa ) , and bacterial e. coli single - stranded dna - binding proteins ( ecossb ) [ 19,20,21 ] .
the second and third domains are the zn domains , and aaa + domains , respectively [ 22 ] .
the three domains can be found in figure 5a .
to initiate replication , these domains seek out designated binding sites on viral dna along a segment known as the core origin of dna .
the sv40 core origin for dna replication ( core ori ) is composed of four pentanucleotide gaggc sequences , an at - rich region ( at ) , and an early palindromic sequence ( ep ). from 5 ' - 3 ' the ori is composed of the ep , the four pentanucleotides , and the at region ( figure 5b ) .
due to the double hexameric nature of ltag , and the asymmetry of the core ori , each hexamer is bound to two gaggc sequences and either an ep or at. once each hexamer is bound , the double hexamer is complete , and completion of the double hexamer is associated with ori melting [ 23 ] .
the gaggc sequences themselves are recognized by the obds of ltag at major grooves [ 24,25 ] , while aaa + regions were found to utilize histidine residues at the tips of beta hairpin loops to interact with ori dna electrostatically at minor grooves ( figure 6b ) [ 22 ] .
because proteins often use arginine residues to orient themselves into narrow minor grooves of dna [ 26 ] , histidine 's role in the aaa + domains of ltag was originally thought to be the same as that of arginine elsewhere ( i.e. , as a dna recognition element ) [ 22 ] .
however , research into the role of these histidines and their respective beta hairpins has suggested unique models for melting discussed below .
7. mechanisms of melting with ltag the identified histidine residue is a component of beta hairpin loops which the aaa + domain utilizes to interact with dna ( figure 6b ) .
because ltag is a double hexamer , the dodecahedric complex contains two aaa + domains with a total of twelve beta hairpin loops , and therefore twelve interactive histidines [ 28 ] .
only a single pair of histidines , one imidazole ring from each aaa + domain , were found to lie in the same minor groove , as well as in the same plane , and within 2.7 angstroms of each other , suggesting the presence of hydrogen bonds to provide enhanced stabilization of the ltag dimer [ 22 ] .
portions of the core ori , at which these histidine anchors were found , have been confirmed to be melted after double hexamer assembly [ 29 ] .
further mutagenesis of these beta hairpin structures has confirmed their necessity during melting of regions flanking the central pentameric sequences of the core ori [ 30 ] .
each set of six beta hairpins are arranged in a planar pattern ultimately creating a ring with a central , positively charged channel ( figure 6b ) [ 31 ] .
this channel is between 7 - 15 angstroms in diameter [ 32 ] , making it incredibly unlikely for dsdna to be thread through , but highly likely for ssdna [ 30,33 ] .
for comparison , a hexameric helicase that has been shown to envelop dsdna , known as ruvb , has a central channel diameter of 30 angstroms [ 34 ] .
the sv40 distant homolog , e1 , utilizes helicase domains determined to envelop solely ssdna ( figure 7d ) , and it contains a central channel 17 angstroms in diameter as a result [ 35 ] .
it is therefore likely that after initial melting , the ssdna will become engulfed in the central channel as the helicase domains translocate down the dna , separating the double helix via steric exclusion principles .
the steric exclusion model of strand separation occurs when one ssdna strand , from the duplex that was melted , is enclosed by a hexameric helicase channel so that when the other strand remains outside of the channel , the duplex may be pried apart further by helicase progression down the ssdna [ 36 ] .
crystal structures of ltag - dna complexes have elucidated that each of the obds of the double hexamer are oriented 180 degrees to each other when bound to dna , potentially as a result of a twisting motion which could have generated mechanical force to melt the ori dna [ 22 ] .
since hairpin histidines act as the anchor for ltag 's aaa + domains , and the minor grooves in which they anchor were subsequently melted , it is feasible that this twisting motion would provide enough force to disrupt hydrogen bonds between base pairs of ori nucleotides , similar to the " untwisting " mechanism utilized by the ltag homolog , e1 ( figure 7 ) .
however , ltag - ori - dna crystal structures showed no significant deformations of dna [ 22 ] .
because of proposals of e1 utilizing trimers in the " untwisting " mechanism before construction of the e1 double hexamers homologous to ltag ( figure 7 ) [ 37 ] , it has been proposed that an intermediate ltag structure is formed as well , which melts the ori before the final ltag double hexamer is assembled for translocation [ 22 ] .
8. structure of the e1 double hexamer and double trimer much like sv40 's ltag , papillomavirus 's e1 is a homohexameric protein complex responsible for both the initiation of melting and the successive unwinding of dna .
e1 recognizes its unique origin of replication ( ori ) through dbds which work to recognize four e1 binding sites , in a nature homologous to sv40 's use of obds to bind four gaggc sequences. from left to right , the e1 protein complex consists of an n - terminal domain , a dbd , an oligomerization domain , a helicase domain , and an acidic c - terminal tail [ 37 ] .
the dbd is oriented between the two helicase domains which are arranged facing each other .
the dbd binds to the e1 binding sites at the center of the ori , while the neighboring helicase domains bind to flanking regions of dna .
the helicase domains of the double hexamer ( dh ) arrange their beta hairpins in a staircase manner as opposed to the planar formation characteristic of ltag helicase domains ( figure 6 ) .
unique to studies of e1 , formation of an e1 double trimer ( dt ) has been identified before formation of a double hexamer .
although the exact structure of the dt has not been identified , it is accepted that the dbd of the trimer is oriented between helicase domains , and that the dbd binds the center of the origin while the helicase domains remain bound to flanking regions of dna .
the dt arises when e1 interacts with a dsdna ori probe in the presence of nucleotides , while the dh subsequently forms in the presence of atp [ 37 ] .
the dt has been shown to recognize the origin of replication , and ultimately convert into a double hexamer on ssdna derived from a melted origin [ 37 ] .
9. mechanisms of melting with e1 although a single e1 trimer does not maintain helicase abilities [ 38 ] , the dt has conclusively demonstrated an ability to melt dsdna into ssdna so that the resulting ssdna may be used as a template for dh assembly [ 37 ] .
the identity of the melting complex as dt and not dh , or an intermediate between the two , was concluded through time - course experimentation [ 39 ] .
the determination of the dt as the melting machinery of e1 has led to recent extensive kinetic and biochemical analyses with the goal of identifying the dt melting mechanism .
plasmid untwisting assays have supported the hypothesis that initial melting is performed via an untwisting mechanism of ori dna by the dt ( figure 7 ) [ 39 ] .
it is proposed that by hydrolyzing atp , the dt manages to utilize histidine residues ( h507 ) in the beta hairpins of the helicase domains to initiate melting ( figure 6a ) .
because the helicase domains themselves remain on the flanks of the e1 binding sites , the histidine interactions with dna are thought to melt the central portion indirectly through structural deformations of the flanks which propagate through the center binding sites via an untwisting mechanism [ 39 ] .
if this mechanism were to occur , then mechanical force must be transmitted from the flanks of the ori through the central binding sites .
therefore , nicks in the dna should inhibit ori melting as a result of interrupting the path of force transference .
this is precisely what shuck and stenlund found during nicking experiments of ori dna [ 39 ] .
the untwisting mechanism has become a widely accepted proposal .
however , a " squeeze - to - open " model has been suggested , in which dsdna is enveloped by dh and ultimately compressed in the central channel of the helicase domains until base pairs are separated [ 40 ] .
the " squeeze - to - open " model is supported by evidence of melting occurring simultaneously as ltag assembly occurs [ 29 ] .
since e1 has only demonstrated central channels capable of enveloping ssdna , a model involving a larger central channel proves more promising for ltag structures , because they have been shown to undergo conformational changes promoting slight dilations of their central channels [ 32 ] .
10. mcm2 - 7 helicase in eukaryotic cells , it has not yet been determined what melts replication origin dna .
the mcm2 - 7 helicase [ 41 ] and the origin recognition complex ( orc ) [ 42 ] assemblies are the most likely candidates , since these complexes hydrolyze atp , and energy is required for origin melting .
the mcm2 - 7 helicase is related to large t and e1 helicase proteins , suggesting conservation of mechanism [ 43 ] .
however , mcm2 - 7 lacks much of the machinery present in the viral counterparts , suggesting that the mechanism for origin melting is different for mcm2 - 7 compared to large t and e1 [ 43 ] .
furthermore , the mcm2 - 7 helicase is very weak on its own [ 44 ] , and mcm2 - 7 requires cdc45 and gins attachment for full helicase activity [ 45 ] .
the cmg ( cdc45 - mcm2 - 7 - gins ) helicase is conserved in archaea as well [ 46 ] .
the mcm2 - 7 has an n - terminal domain , required for double hexamer attachment , and a c - terminal aaa + domain , required for atpase activity [ 41,47 ] .
the double - hexamer interface is active during late m and g1 phase , when the mcm2 - 7 is loaded as a double hexamer [ 47,48 ] .
however , during s phase , when the replication fork helicase is activated , the mcm2 - 7 double hexamers dissociate , and the resulting cmg helicases unwind bidirectionally from the origin [ 49,50 ] .
the mcm2 - 7 helicase also has dna binding regions within the n - terminal and aaa + domains [ 51,52 ] .
it is generally agreed that the cdc45 - mcm2 - 7 - gins assembly , the fully - active helicase , unwinds dna by a steric exclusion mechanism [ 49,53,54,55 ] .
in this model , the leading strand passes through the central channel of cmg [ 49,53,54,55 ] .
the excluded lagging strand may pass through a side channel of the cmg , or alternatively the lagging strand may pass completely outside the cmg [ 49,53,54,55 ] .
in either event , the double - stranded origin dna must be melted to activate cmg unwinding .
what is the mechanism for replication fork unwinding by the cmg ?
according to the rotary model , the ssdna lying inside the central channel of cmg is passed from one aaa + domain to another in a sequential manner [ 35 ] .
this model is derived mainly from homology to the large t and e1 viral helicase systems , for which a rotary model is proposed [ 35 ] .
a second model , based upon recent electron microscopy structures , proposes that the ssdna binding regions of the aaa + domain hands - off the ssdna to the ssdna binding region within the n - terminal region [ 49,53,54,55 ] .
future studies may reveal which one of these two models reflects the cmg mechanism for unwinding dna in vivo .
the origin dsdna encircled by mcm2 - 7 must be converted from dsdna to ssdna during replication initiation .
in budding yeast , the origins are at - rich , similar to the origins of bacteria and eukaryotic viral origins , suggesting that this may be conserved to promote initial melting of the origin , since at - rich regions are inherently prone to melting .
the mcm2 - 7 may open to promote exclusion of the lagging strand during the replication initiation .
however , the mechanism for mcm2 - 7 ring opening is currently not known , but it may occur at the mcm2 - mcm5 interface because this interaction surface is inherently weak [ 44,56,57 ] .
future studies may reveal how the mcm2 - 7 ring opens during s phase to allow for origin melting , and future studies may also reveal whether ring opening occurs before or after mcm2 - 7 double hexamer dissociation .
additional ssdna binding proteins may participate in the origin melting process .
proteins that bind origin ssdna in budding yeast include mcm10 [ 58,59 ] , sld3 [ 60 ] , sld2 [ 61 ] , dpb11 [ 62 ] , and rpa [ 63 ] , the eukaryotic single - stranded binding protein .
these proteins do not hydrolyze atp , and therefore their contribution to origin melting lies in their ability to bind ssdna and stabilize the melted state .
interestingly , mutating the ssdna binding residues of mcm10 , sld2 , sld3 , and dpb11 results in decreased replication initiation and diminished recruitment of rpa to replication origins [ 62,64,65,66 ] .
these data suggest that one or more of these initiation factors may be required to stabilize melted origin ssdna , and perhaps even hand off melted origin dna to rpa .
however , little is known regarding the mechanism for how the initiation factors melt origin dna , and little is known how the initiation factors hand off ssdna to rpa .
the human homologs of mcm10 ( human mcm10 ) [ 67,68 ] , sld3 ( treslin ) [ 66 ] , and sld2 , recql4 [ 69 ] , have also been shown to bind ssdna , suggesting that the function may be conserved from budding yeast to human .
a replication initiation assay has recently been reconstituted for budding yeast using only purified proteins [ 70 ] .
furthermore , methods exist in budding yeast for the induced - degradation of essential genes , with phenotypic scoring of the mutant phenotype [ 71,72 ] .
in addition , the ssdna binding residues of the initiation factors have now been identified for budding yeast [ 62,64,65,66 ] .
thus , through a combination of in vitro reconstitution assays and in vivo experiments , a mechanistic understanding of how origin dna is melted , stabilized , and transferred to rpa will soon be revealed for this model eukaryotic organism .
11. concluding remarks a key step in replication initiation in all organisms may be the melting of origin dna , since replication fork helicases in all systems seem to unwind dna by a steric exclusion mechanism .
in bacteria , the dnaa protein may be responsible for melting origin dna , and also for loading the helicase onto the melted ssdna .
for eukaryotic viruses , the large t and e1 helicases are competent to melt the origin dna and subsequently unwind the dna by steric exclusion .
for the cellular eukaryotic replication initiation machinery , it appears that essential initiation factors , including mcm10 , sld3 , sld2 , and dpb11 , may be responsible for stabilizing the melted origin dna , and these proteins may also participate in the hand - off of melted origin ssdna to rpa .
thus , while origin melting is common for all domains of life , the mechanism for origin melting may be quite different for each dna replication initiation system .

ssdna : single - stranded dna .
figure 2 proposed loop conformation of inactive oric , constrained by dnaa bound to high - affinity sites r1 , r2 , and r4 via domain i n - terminus interactions .
this conformation is facilitated by fis .
figure 3 the origin of replication in escherichia coli , oric .
this 245 - bp sequence consists of the 13 - mer dna unwinding element ( red ) , dnaa - trio motifs ( blue ) , and binding sites for dnaa , integration host factor ( ihf ) , and fis .
additionally , flanking genes gida and mioc are shown .
the arrows represent the transcription direction of the flanking genes ( large , hollow arrows ) and directionality of dnaa filament formation ( small arrows above dnaa boxes ) .
the black arrows help visualize each type of supercoiling , shown above the oric .
figure 4 active oric conformation , showing interactions between r1 and r5m facilitated by ihf , and interactions between r1 dnaa and dna unwinding element ( due ) - bound dnaa , which facilitates filament formation on ssdna .
the thicker blue line represents double - stranded oric dna , and the thin lines of the " bubble " represent the single - stranded dna of the melted due .
figure 5 structure of the large t antigen ( ltag ) and the simian virus 40 ( sv40 ) core ori .
( a ) a cartoon model illustrating the double hexameric ltag complex and its relevant subdivisions .
a single hexamer is noted to contain a portion of the origin binding domain ( obd ) and a helicase domain , which itself includes a zn and aaa + domain ; ( b ) depiction of the core ori of sv40 viral double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) including the four gaggc pentamers and the flanking at - rich ( at ) and early palindromic sequence ( ep ) regions .
the box around two pentamers and the ep region indicates what portion of the core ori a single hexamer of ltag would occupy .
figure 6 e1 vs. ltag beta hairpin structure .
( a ) a cartoon model depicting the central channel of an e1 helicase domain from a down - the - barrel point of view .
the outer circles represent helicase subunits while the structures numbered 1 - 6 designate the beta hairpin loops .
these loops overlap to create a " staircase " pattern .
the foot of the beta hairpin staircase is numbered 1 .
the increasing numbers correspond to higher steps in the staircase .
hairpin loop 2 sits higher than hairpin 1 , while 3 overlaps 2 , 4 overlaps 3 , and so on in an ascending pattern characteristic of e1 hairpins .
the histidine residues employed in the untwisting mechanism of melting are denoted in purple at the tip of each hairpin ; ( b ) a cartoon model depicting the central channel of an ltag hexameric complex .
the six circular domains signify the six helicase subunits while the six oval structures represent beta hairpin loops .
the hairpin loops are organized into a planar arrangement characteristic of ltag helicase domains , a distinct organizational method not found in e1 that may contribute to unique melting mechanisms .
histidine residues at the tip of each hairpin are marked in purple [ 27 ] .
figure 7 the e1 " unwinding " mechanism of origin melting .
( a ) an illustration of an e1 monomer .
twelve of these constitute an e1 double hexameric complex shown to unwind dna after initial melting ; ( b ) pre - twist : assembly of a single trimer of e1 monomers around dsdna , and the insertion of histidine residues into the dsdna ; the numbers 1 , 2 , and 3 demark the three subunits of the trimer .
( c ) post - twist : the slight rotation , or " twist " , has resulted in a melted origin and reorientation of the three subunits as a result ; ( d ) assembly of a single hexamer of e1 onto ssdna post melting .

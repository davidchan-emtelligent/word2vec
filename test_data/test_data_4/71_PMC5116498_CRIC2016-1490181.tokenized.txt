a 49 - year - old man presented with chest pain , dyspnea , and lactic acidosis .
left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis were detected .
the sequencing of mitochondrial genome ( mtdna ) revealed the presence of a to g mtdna point mutation at position 3243 ( m.3243a > g ) in trna leu ( uur ) gene .
diagnosis of cardiac involvement in a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy , lactic acidosis , and stroke - like episodes syndrome ( melas ) was made .
due to increased risk of sudden cardiac death , cardioverter defibrillator was implanted .
1. introduction mitochondrial disease is a multisystem disorder with highly heterogeneous clinical pictures and can present at any age [ 1 ] .
the disorder may affect virtually any organ and cause significant morbidity .
the prevalence of mtdna disease is estimated at 1 : 5000 individuals in western populations , and 1 : 200 of healthy newborns harbour a potentially pathogenic mtdna mutation [ 1 ] .
the m.3243a > g mutation in the mttl1 gene ( trna leu ( uur )) is one of the commonest mtdna mutations and can cause several clinical phenotypes including , such as in the presented case , mitochondrial encephalomyopathy , lactic acidosis , and stroke - like episodes syndrome ( melas ) [ 2 - 4 ] .
other common symptoms include seizures , cognitive impairment , muscle weakness and exercise intolerance , sensorineural hearing loss , cardiomyopathy , migraine , bowel dysmotility , and short stature [ 4 ] .
according to a recent retrospective study , hearing loss and diabetes were the most frequent clinical features , followed by stroke - like episodes [ 4 ] .
in this context , genetic counseling is an important component of patient diagnosis [ 4 ] .
2. case report a 49 - year - old man presented at emergency room with severe chest pain , dyspnea , and metabolic decompensation with lactic acidosis .
personal medical history was also characterized by mild developmental delay , short stature , hearing loss , renal and glycometabolic failure , lactic acidosis , and a family history of sudden death in two maternal relatives .
serial troponin i was elevated and reached a peak value of 6.8 ucg / l. laboratory examinations revealed also a significantly increased bnp value ( 808 ng / l , normal value < 110 ng / l ) and glucose level ( 852 mg / dl , normal value < 110 mg / dl ) and a moderate increase in creatinine level ( 2.3 mg / dl , normal value < 1.3 mg / dl ) and lactate value ( 2.2 mmol / l , normal value < 1.6 mmol / l ) .
electrocardiogram ( ecg ) revealed short pr interval and left ventricular ( lv ) hypertrophy ( figure 1 ( a )) .
echocardiogram showed concentric , nonobstructive lv hypertrophy ( figure 1 ( b )) with ejection fraction ( ef ) of 55 % , mild aortic and mitral regurgitation , interatrial defect with left to right shunt , and restrictive filling pattern .
urgent cardiac - ct using a second - generation dual - source 128 slices ct scanner ( somatom definition flash , siemens , erlangen , germany ) revealed the presence of predominantly noncalcified atherosclerotic plaques without significant obstructive coronary stenosis and a severe concentric lv hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function .
the global lv myocardial mass was increased to 186 gr / m2 ( reference range : 70 - 113 gr / m2 ) with a maximum wall thickness at the anterior basal wall of 20 mm. a small pericardial effusion and a mild hypertrophy of the right ventricle with a maximum wall thickness of 8 mm were demonstrated .
after 8 minutes , a late - enhancement acquisition using the dual - energy technique ( 100 / 140 kv setting ) was performed , showing multifocal areas of late - enhancement ( figures 2 ( a1 ) - 2 ( a6 ) color - coded maps ; and figures 2 ( b1 ) - 2 ( b6 ) merged gray - scale maps , arrows ) with a nonischemic pattern ( subepicardial and predominantly intramural ) .
considering the information obtained by clinical history , laboratory testing , and imaging , the patient underwent thorough genetic assessment due to a high index of suspicion for a mitochondrial disorder .
a cerebral ct performed as part of the diagnostic work - up , showed atrophy of the cerebellar vermis , basal ganglia calcifications , and focal white matter hypodense lesions consistent with lacunar infarcts .
a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) study was performed ( 1.5 t , aera , siemens medical systems , erlangen , germany ) after 2 - week follow - up of supportive medical therapy showing multifocal areas of myocardial edema on t2 - stir images with a nonischemic distribution ( figures 2 ( c1 ) - 2 ( c6 ) , arrows ) and a persistent but reduced lv hypertrophy , accounting for a global myocardial mass of 155 gr / m2 with a maximum wall thickness at the anterior basal wall of 15.5 mm ; the global lv systolic function was still preserved .
multifocal patchy late - enhancement concerning the presence of nonischemic necrosis / fibrosis was demonstrated too ( figures 2 ( d1 ) - 2 ( d6 ) , arrows ) , which correlated with late - enhancement detected by dual - energy ct .
48 - hour ecg monitoring was performed and neither atrial nor ventricular arrhythmia were detected .
however , after considering the increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to the strong family history and the evidence of myocardial fibrosis , primary prophylaxis with implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( icd ) was performed .
after a lengthy hospital stay with supportive care , the patient was later discharged from the hospital to home asymptomatic and without further complications .
during hospitalization and at discharge , the patient did not present with any neurological disturbances requiring antiepileptic medications , antioxidants , and other cofactors [ 5 ] .
the sequencing of the whole mitochondrial genome ( mtdna ) revealed the presence of the a to g mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) point mutation at position 3243 ( m.3243a > g ) in trna leu ( uur ) gene ( figure 2 ( e ) , arrow ) , with variable mutant load in all the analyzed tissues ( figure 2 ( f )) .
3. discussion since muscle contraction and relaxation are active processes which involve energy metabolism and mitochondrial function , an impaired oxidative phosphorylation may in result in cardiac dysfunction .
although the evidence from literature is limited , a recent prospective study demonstrated the presence of lv hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography in 2 of 8 adult patients with melas syndrome [ 6 ] .
nevertheless , cardiac manifestation ( arrhythmias , dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ) was reported to occur in about 38 % of patients with melas syndrome [ 7 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first case of a comprehensive integrated imaging with both ct and mri in a melas syndrome patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .
importantly , cardiac - ct can be useful to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease in the acute evaluation of chest pain patients presenting with normal or low - positive troponin - elevation [ 8 ] .
according to a recent study [ 9 ] , the presence of a concentric hypertrophic remodelling pattern is frequently found in melas - like patients .
furthermore , late gadolinium enhancement ( lge ) at mri , which reflects expansion of the myocardial interstitium caused by disperse interstitial fibrosis , partial myocardial disarray , and fibrous replacement of irreversibly injured myocytes , was present in 73 % of patients ( n = 8 / 11 ) with a diffuse , nonischemic ( predominantly intramural ) , patchy pattern [ 9 ] , such as in the presented case .
another interesting mechanism involved in the development of the lge pattern observed in melas patients might be vessels leakage due to mitochondrial angiopathy , such as for stroke - like lesions [ 9 ] .
the vasogenic effect translates into changes in microvascular permeability and extracellular edema formation that may in part contribute to the myocardial lge [ 9 ]. that is in accordance with the presence of multifocal edema at the t2 - stir sequences [ 9 ] .
in the current case , the reduction of myocardial mass of approximately 17 % observed between cardiac - ct and cardiac - mri was supposed to be related primarily to myocardial edema regression after supportive medical therapy , although different techniques and software applications between the two methods may in part explain that discrepancy .
myocardial viability imaging by delayed - enhancement dual - energy ct is a recently introduced and promising technique that takes advantage of the fact that iodine , the typically used contrast material in ct , shows similar washout kinetics of gadolinium and has a very unique dual - energy absorption characteristic at different x - ray spectra .
in this way , by generating color - coded perfusion map of iodine distribution , it is possible to enhance contrast resolution of ct imaging to achieve a better detection of iodine concentration within myocardial fibrotic scar [ 10 ] .
this has allowed imaging of infarcted myocardium with a high level of concordance between ct and mri .
similarly to other genetic cardiomyopathies ( including hypertrophic cardiomiopathy ) , lge detection may play an additional prognostic role in the risk stratification of melas patients since lge has been related to worsening of lv function and adverse outcome [ 9 , 11 ] .
the current study highlights the importance of multimodality imaging with echocardiography , cardiac - ct , and cardiac - mri if there is any suspicion of cardiac involvement associated with a rare neurometabolic disorder .
in such cases , integrated information derived by ct and mri regarding the presence and distribution of coronary atherosclerosis , myocardial edema , and late - enhancement may have important therapeutic and prognostic consequences .

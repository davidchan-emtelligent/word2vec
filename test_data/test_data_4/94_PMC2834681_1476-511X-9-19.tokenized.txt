multiple sclerosis ( ms ) patients present a decrease of antioxidants and neuroprotective and immunoregulatory vitamins and an increase of total homocysteine ( thcy ) , cholesterol ( chl ) , hdl - cholesterol , and of cellular stress markers , variably associated with the different phases of the disease .
we compared the blood levels of uric acid , folic acid , vitamins b12 , a , and e , thcy , chl , hdl - cholesterol , and triglycerides in forty ms patients during a phase of clinical inactivity with those of eighty healthy controls , matched for age and sex .
we found higher levels of thcy ( p = 0.032 ) and of hdl - cholesterol ( p = 0.001 ) and lower levels of vitamin e ( p = 0.001 ) and the ratio vitamin e / chl ( p = 0.001 ) in ms patients .
in conclusion , modifications of some biochemical markers of cell damage were detected in ms patients during a phase of clinical inactivity .
findings a decrease of antioxidants [ 1 ] , and neuroprotective [ 2,3 ] and immunoregulatory vitamins [ 3,4 ] and an increase of total homocysteine ( t - hcy ) [ 5 ] , cholesterol ( chl ) , hdl - cholesterol [ 6 ] , and of cellular stress markers [ 7,8 ] were reported in patients affected by multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .
these changes are regarded as markers of autoimmunity or neurodegeneration .
recently , in view of the unreliability of these results , mainly due to the heterogeneity of the samples investigated , attention has focused on clinical relapse ; and active ms has proved to be associated with a decrease of uric acid ( ua ) and an increase of chl and stress markers [ 1,6,8 ] .
to characterize the biochemical status of ms during a phase of clinical inactivity , we compared the blood levels of ua , folic acid ( fa ) , vitamins b12 , a , and e , t - hcy , chl , hdl - cholesterol , and triglycerides ( tg ) in stable ms patients with those of healthy controls .
forty consecutive ms patients with relapsing - remitting or secondary - progressive courses and in a phase of clinical inactivity , participated in the study .
they had been free of steroids for at least one month and of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs for at least two months .
the study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee .
formal written consent was obtained from each patient .
two venous blood samples were obtained from patient with a time lag of one month in between .
a number of healthy individuals were enrolled after their formal written consent .
controls were matched for age (+ 2 years ) and gender to the patients in the ratio of two controls for each case .
a venous blood sample was obtained from each control .
pregnant women , habitual smokers , alcohol drinkers , and consumers of vitamins - rich products were excluded .
among the cases , individuals with other disorders in addition to ms were also excluded .
venipuncture , using masked materials , was performed in fasting subjects who on the two previous days had avoided certain habits ( alcohol consumption , cigarettes , cigars , and pipe smoking ) and foods ( red meat , liver , kidney , spleen , fish and sea food , salted food and fat cheese , sweets , grapes , bananas , figs , persimmons , cherry , nuts , and the like ) which could have modified the concentration of the molecules to be detected .
the ubbink method was used to establish plasma levels of thcy [ 9 ] .
competitive magnetic separation on a technicon immuno autoanalyser was used for serum fa and vitamin b12 assays .
high - performance liquid chromatography and fluorimetry were used for vitamin a and vitamin e assays .
commercially available enzymatic colorimetric tests were used for ua , chl , hdl - cholesterol , and tg assays ( roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim ) .
the vitamin e / chl ratio was calculated .
mean differences in normally distributed data between cases and controls were analysed by student 's t test .
as thcy , fa , ua , vitamin a , and vitamin e concentrations were not uniformly distributed , median values and the mann - whitney u test were used for comparison of the patient and control groups .
to increase dosage reliability ; patients had two different venipunctures and their mean value was used for calculations .
we included 40 ms patients and 80 healthy controls .
the patients' median age was 39.5 years ( range 16 - 58 ) ; twelve were male ; mean ms duration was 11.95 +/ - 9.28 years ; median edss was 3.0 ( range 1.0 - 6.0 ) ; mean msss was 3.95 +/ - 1.95 ; 28 patients had a relapsing - remitting course and 12 had a secondary - progressive course .
because of the matching criteria , the control group had the same distribution for age ( median age : 38.5 years ; range 16 - 56 ) and gender .
table 1 shows the results obtained for each molecule comparing the cases and the control groups .
the concentration of ua , fa , tg , and vitamin a was similar between patients and controls .
vitamin b12 and chl concentration was higher in ms patients , but the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance .
the concentration of hdl - cholesterol and hcy was higher in the ms group , while the concentration of vitamin e and the ratio of vitamin e and chl ( e / chl ) were lower in the ms group ; these differences were statistically significant .

degrees student " t test " was used to calculate statistical significativity for vitamin b12 , cholesterol , hdl - cholesterol , triglycerid , and e / chl ratio .
mann - whitney u test was used to calculate statistical significativity for folic acid , uric acid , homocysteine , vitamin a , and vitamin e. this study shows that the ms patients in a phase of clinical inactivity presented modifications of some biochemical markers of cell damage .
the study 's main weakness is its limited sample size and it must therefore be regarded as preliminary to larger investigations .
however , the study also has some strong points : it restricted inclusion to patients in a clinically stable phase , it excluded primary progressive ms patients , and on the days preceding the venipuncture it excluded the intake of foods or substances that might have modified the concentration of the molecules studied .
we found that the ms patients in a phase of clinical stability had higher blood levels of thcy and hdl - cholesterol and lower blood levels of vitamin e and the e / chl ratio .
the increased levels of thcy , that we found in our patients , were consistent with those of previous studies performed in ms patients outside relapse [ 5 ] .
the meaning of the increase , which damaged the folding of proteins by increasing the cleavage of disulphide bridges and was targeted to generate free radicals , is uncertain and requires specific study .
our data agree with those reported elsewhere that thcy increase was paralleled not by a decrease of vitamin b12 and fa , as usually reported for other disorders , but by normal or increased values of both vitamins [ 5 ] .
this observation also requires " ad hoc " studies .
the increased concentration of hdl - cholesterol in a stable phase of the disease could counteract the increased concentration of cholesterol that occurs in the course of a relapse and ensure that it reaches the liver [ 10 ] .
increased values of total and hdl - cholesterol were reported in a study aimed at assessing the correlation between blood chl and mri activity after a clinical episode suggesting ms [ 6 ] .
the decrease of the concentration of vitamin e , the major hydrophobic chain - breaking antioxidant , confirms the possible involvement of this vitamin in ms pathology : vitamin e levels are decreased in the demyelination plaques of ms brains , and vitamin e levels and e / chl ratios are lower in the serum of ms patients [ 2 ] .
however , serum vitamin e is not a marker of clinical activity because it is not paralleled by a similar low concentration in the csf or by a reduction of the [ vitamin ecsf ]/[ vitamin eserum ] ratio .
our data could indicate that vitamin e was consumed to counterbalance ms chronic neurodegeneration .
we observed no differences as regards ua , fa , vitamin a , vitamin b12 , chl , and tg between ms patients in a phase of clinical inactivity and healthy controls , which means that they are unlikely to be involved in the biochemical processes taking place during this phase of ms. however , the role of ua concentration in ms outside a clinical relapse remains controversial .
some researchers did not find any association with ms , agreeing with our results ; others found an increase of ua both in serum and in cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) [ 1,7,11 ] .
these conflicting results could be explained by differences in the populations studied or by different detection methods and they require further investigation for a better understanding of the role of ua in the biochemical changes occurring in the course of ms. competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests .

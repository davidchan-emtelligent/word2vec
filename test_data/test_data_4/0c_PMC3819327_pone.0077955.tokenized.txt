background mycoplasma hyorhinis ( m.hyorhinis , m.hy ) is associated with development of gastric and prostate cancers .
the nlrp3 inflammasome , a protein complex controlling maturation of important pro - inflammatory cytokines interleukin ( il ) - 1beta and il - 18 , is also involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis of various cancers .
methodology / principal findings to clarify whether m.hy promoted tumor development via inflammasome activation , we analyzed monocytes for il - 1beta and il - 18 production upon m.hy challenge .
when exposed to m.hy , human monocytes exhibited rapid and robust il - 1beta and il - 18 secretion .
we further identified that lipid - associated membrane protein ( lamp ) from m.hy was responsible for il - 1beta induction .
applying competitive inhibitors , gene specific shrna and gene targeted mice , we verified that m.hy induced il - 1beta secretion was nlrp3 - dependent in vitro and in vivo .
cathepsin b activity , k + efflux , ca2 + influx and ros production were all required for the nlrp3 inflammasome activation by m.hy. importantly , it is il - 1beta but not il - 18 produced from macrophages challenged with m.hy promoted gastric cancer cell migration and invasion .
conclusions our data suggest that activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome by m.hy may be associated with its promotion of gastric cancer metastasis , and anti - m.hy therapy or limiting nlrp3 signaling could be effective approach for control of gastric cancer progress .

introduction mycoplasmas are pleomorphic , wall free , prokaryotic organisms that reside either on the eukaryotic cell membranes or inside the cells , and they are the smallest organisms capable of self replication [ 1 ] .
to date , at least 16 mycoplasma species have been isolated from humans [ 2 ] .
mycoplasma hyorhinis ( m.hy ) was considered non - pathogenic to humans as it usually infects swine leading to respiratory tract disease and inflammation of the chest and joints [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
however , accumulating evidence suggests that m.hy infection in humans does result in clinical outcomes .
m.hy was found in 56 % of gastric carcinoma , 55 % of colon carcinoma and 52.6 % of lung carcinoma biopsies [ 5 ] .
moreover , 36 % men with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) and 52 % men with prostate cancer are m.hy sero - positive .
these clinical findings suggest a possible connection between m.hy exposure with gastric , colon , lung and prostate cancers [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
upon microbial infection , host pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) such as tlrs sense the pathogens and trigger the synthesis of pro - inflammatory cytokines such as pro - il - 1beta and pro - il - 18 via nf - kappab activation .
at the same time , another group of prrs including nlrp3 recruit the adaptor protein asc and lead to the activation of caspase - 1 , which is an active protease that cleaves the precursor form of cytokines including pro - il - 1beta and pro - il - 18 into mature , secreted form [ 7 ] .
pathogens or challenging agents cause potassium efflux , mitochondria damage , mitochondria dna release , ros production , intracellular calcium increase or cellular cyclic amp decrease in innate immune cells , which are all involved in caspase - 1 activation [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
during this process , the nlrp3 , asc and pro - caspase - 1 form a molecular platform called inflammasome .
so far , a number of inflammasomes have been identified , of them , the nlrp3 inflammasome has been found associated with tumor development [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , although controversy exists from different models [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
nonetheless , il - 1beta was reported to promote tumor cell growth and metastasis by inducing several pro - metastatic genes such as matrix metalloproteinases and endothelial adhesion molecules , as well as tgf - beta , chemokines and growth factors [ 18 ] .
in a korean population , the combination of increased mucosal il - 1beta level and homozygosity for il - 1beta - 31t single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) are both associated with increased risk for gastric cancer [ 18 ] .
furthermore , tu et al. found that stomach - specific expression of human il - 1beta in transgenic mice led to spontaneous gastric inflammation and cancer [ 19 ] , further suggesting that il - 1beta may promote human gastric carcinogenesis .
in contrast , il - 18 enhances nk cell activity , reduces tumorigenesis , induces apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis in tumor cells to exert anti - tumor effects [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
in addition , an inappropriate production of il - 18 was found to contribute to the pathogenesis of cancers and may influence the clinical outcome of patients [ 22 ] .
il - 18 was reported to stimulate matrix metalloprotease - 9 production , resulting in increased migration and invasion in coronary artery smooth muscle cells and hl - 60 myeloid leukemia cells [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
it was also reported that the serum il - 18 level in gastric cancer patient group was significantly higher than that in gastric ulcer patient group [ 25 ] and il - 18 can increase metastasis and immune escape of stomach cancer via the down - regulation of cd70 and maintenance of cd44 in human gastric cancer cell line nci - n87 and snu16 [ 26 ] .
it is also a critical mediator of vegf - enhanced migration in human gastric cancer cell lines snu - 601 [ 27 ] .
the above findings suggest that mycoplasma hyorhinis may promote migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells by activating inflammasome .
to date , a wide spectrum of microbes including viruses , bacteria , fungi and protozoa have been identified to activate the nlrp3 inflammasome [ 28 ] .
a recent study showed that mycoplasma pneumoniae was also able to induce il - 1beta production in human cells [ 29 ] .
however , whether m.hy , which is an important factor in gastric cancer development as mentioned above [ 5 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , activates the nlrp3 inflammasome and whether this activation contributes to the gastric cancer development remain unknown .
in this study , we found that m.hy triggered il - 1beta secretion in a nlrp3 inflammasome - dependent manner , and the resulting il - 1beta induced migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells .
results m.hy triggers il - 1beta and il - 18 production in thp - 1 cells to determine whether m.hy induces il - 1beta production from innate immune cells , we monitored mature il - 1beta levels in human monocytic cell line thp - 1 cells challenged with different amounts of m.hy. in this experiment , a strong induction of il - 1beta in a dose - dependent manner was observed ( figure 1a ) .
next , we measured the pro - il - 1beta mrna levels in the cells and mature il - 1beta protein levels in the culture supernatants at different time points after m.hy challenge .
it was observed that il - 1beta mrna levels peaked at 3 hours after challenge ( figure 1b ) and mature il - 1beta ( figure 1c ) and il - 18 ( figure 1d ) protein levels peaked at 12 hours after challenge .
moreover , thp - 1 derived macrophages also exhibited robust secretion of il - 1beta , il - 18 as well as other inflammatory cytokines such as il - 6 and il - 8 ( figure 1e , figure s1 ) .
to confirm the above findings in thp - 1 cell line , we examined the il - 1beta production in primary human monocytes from healthy donors challenged with m.hy , wherein il - 1beta was also strongly induced ( figure 1f ) .
these data indicated that m.hy triggered robust il - 1beta and il - 18 secretion from human myeloid cells .

lamp derived from m.hy is responsible for il - 1beta induction through tlr2 next we investigated whether replication of m.hy was required for il - 1beta production in monocytes .
as shown in figure 2a , m . hy inactivated by heating or ultra - violet ( uv ) treatment induced as much il - 1beta secretion from thp - 1 cells as live m.hy. this indicated that certain heat - and uv - resistant component of m.hy was responsible for induction of il - 1beta secretion .
lipid - associated membrane protein ( lamp ) is abundantly expressed on the surface of m.hy [ 32 ] , and previous study found that membrane lipoproteins from other mycoplasma species induced il - 1beta secretion [ 33 ] .
we thus speculated that m.hy derived lamp ( mlamp ) may be responsible for the il - 1beta induction in thp - 1 cells .
we then extracted lamp from m.hy ( figure 2b ) and tested the capability of mlamp to induce il - 1beta secretion in thp - 1 cells .
we found that mlamp clearly induced secretion of il - 1beta in a dose - dependent manner , while the aqueous phase of m.hy extract was not able to do so ( figure 2c ) .
to exclude the possible rna and / or dna contamination in mlamp , we treated the mlapms with rnase and dnase and found that mlamp was the major component for il - 1beta induction ( figure s2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0077955.g002 figure 2 mlamp is responsible for il - 1beta induction through tlr2 .
a , 5x104 thp - 1 cells were treated with heat or ultra - violet irradiation inactivated m.hy for 6 hours and the supernatants were harvested for il - 1beta elisa .
b , total protein of m.hy , mlamp extracted from m.hy and the aqueous protein were detected by sds - page and silver staining .
c , 5x104 thp - 1 cells were treated with mlamp at different concentrations and aqueous , 6 hours later the supernatants were harvested for il - 1beta elisa .
d , 5x104 thp - 1 cells were pre - incubated with the indicated amounts of mab t2.5 or cont2 ( microg / ml ) for 0.5 hour and challenged with tlr2 ligand p3csk4 ( positive control ) , tlr4 ligand lps ( negative control ) and m.hy at a concentration of 6.7x107 ccu / ml subsequently for 6 hours , the supernatants were harvested for il - 1beta elisa .
the values represent the mean +/ - the standard deviation of three independent experiments .
*** represents p < 0.001 , ** represents p < 0.01 and * represents p < 0.05 in comparison with control in statistic analysis .
it was reported that mlamp mainly activated nf - kappab through tlr2 and tlr6 [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
therefore , we first applied a tlr2 neutralizing antibody t2.5 to block the tlr2 signal , with cont2 serving as an isotype control [ 36 ] .
as shown in figure 2d , t2.5 completely blocked the il - 1beta secretion stimulated by tlr2 agonist p3csk4 but not by the tlr4 ligand lps .
importantly , il - 1beta secretion from m.hy infected cells was strongly reduced by t2.5 , indicating that tlr2 was involved in mlamp triggered il - 1beta secretion in human monocytes .
interestingly , il - 1beta secretion from m.hy infected cells was not completely blocked by t2.5 ( figure 2d ) , which suggested that tlr2 - independent signaling pathway was also involved in mlamp triggered il - 1beta secretion , which deserves further investigation in future .
m.hy induces il - 1beta secretion through activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome to test whether m.hy induced il - 1beta secretion through inflammasome activation , we first utilized lps primed thp - 1 derived macrophages to check if m.hy can activate inflammasome like atp or msu , which are known inflammasome activators .
as shown in figure 3a , m . hy was able to induce il - 1beta release in the primed cells .
next we examined the cleavage of caspase - 1 and oligomerization of asc , two important makers for the inflammasome activation .
we found that m.hy promoted the cleavage of caspase - 1 and oligomerization of asc ( figure 3b ) , indicating a direct activation of inflammasome by m.hy .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0077955.g003 figure 3 m.hy induced il - 1beta production is nlrp3 inflammasome dependent .
a , 1x105 pma - induced macrophages were primed with 50 ng / ml lps , then treated with m.hy , lps , msu or atp for 5 hours , the supernatants were harvested for il - 1beta elisa .
b , the cleavage of caspase - 1 and oligomerization of asc in the inflammasome - enriched and cross - linked lysates of thp - 1 derived macrophages treated with m.hy , lps and msu for 6 hours .
monomers , dimers , and oligomers of asc were indicated accordingly .
c , 5x104 thp - 1 were pretreated with caspase - 1 inhibitor ac - yvad - cho and then challenged with m.hy at a concentration of 6.7x107 ccu / ml , 12 hours later the supernatants were harvested for il - 1beta elisa .
d , successful silencing ( knock - down , kd ) of asc and caspase - 1 was verified by western blotting .
e , 5x104 thp - 1 scramble , caspase - 1 kd cells and asc kd cells were treated with m.hy at a concentration of 6.7x107 ccu / ml , 12 hours later the supernatants were collected for il - 1beta elisa .
f , 5x104 thp - 1 cells were pretreated with nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitor glybenclamide and then challenged with m.hy , 12 hours later the supernatants were harvested for il - 1beta elisa .
g , successful silencing of nlrp3 was verified by western blotting .
h , 5x104 thp - 1 scramble and nlrp3 kd cells were treated with m.hy at a concentration of 6.7x107 ccu / ml , 12 hours later the supernatants were collected for il - 1beta elisa .
i , immunoblotting analysis of pro - caspase - 1 and mature ( p10 ) form of caspase - 1 and mature il - 1beta ( p17 ) in supernatants and pro - il - 1beta ( p31 ) and beta - actin in cell extracts of thp - 1 scramble and caspase - 1 kd , asc kd and nlrp3 kd cells treated with m.hy for 6 hours .
data presented are mean +/ - sd of one representative out of three independent experiments .
*** represents p < 0.001 in comparison with control in statistic analysis .
furthermore , we tested whether m.hy induced il - 1beta secretion was dependent on certain inflammasome components .
first , we found that the specific caspase - 1 inhibitor ac - yvad - cho decreased il - 1beta secretion in thp - 1 cells in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 3c ) .
next , when specific shrna was employed to silence the expression of caspase - 1 and asc ( figure 3d ) , il - 1beta production was strongly decreased upon m.hy challenge ( figure 3e ) , indicating that m.hy induced il - 1beta secretion was dependent on caspase - 1 and asc .
then , we tested whether nlrp3 was required for m.hy induced il - 1beta secretion .
first , we found that the nlrp3 inhibitor glybenclamide suppressed m.hy induced il - 1beta secretion in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 3f ) [ 37 ] .
when specific shrna was employed to silence the expression of nlrp3 ( figure 3g ) , il - 1beta production was strongly decreased upon m.hy challenge ( figure 3h ) , indicating that m.hy induced il - 1beta secretion was dependent on nlrp3 .
this was further confirmed by immunoblotting , in which the caspase - 1 activation and il - 1beta production were both nlrp3 dependent ( figure 3i ) .
moreover , we further found that mlamp was the major component responsible for nlrp3 inflammasome activation by m.hy ( figure s2c ) .
in addition , aim2 inflammasome was reported to be activated by dna [ 38 ] , and we found that m.hy dna induced il - 1beta secretion via aim2 inflammasome ( figure s3a ) .
interestingly , m.hy induced il - 1beta secretion was mainly dependent on nlrp3 , while aim2 was only partially involved ( figure s3a ) .
taken together , these results clearly demonstrated that m.hy induced il - 1beta secretion through activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome in human monocytic cells .
mechanisms underlying m.hy triggered nlrp3 inflammasome activation activation of nlrp3 inflammasome by a variety of stimuli depends on cathepsin b activity , k + efflux , calcium influx and / or production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 39 ] .
to explore the mechanisms underlying il - 1beta release in response to m.hy challenge , we first applied cathepsin b - specific inhibitor ca - 074 me and observed a significant attenuation of il - 1beta secretion upon m.hy challenge .
at a concentration of 100 microm , ca - 074 me completely blocked il - 1beta release ( figure 4a ) .
this inhibition was not due to any toxic effect to the cells as il - 8 secretion affected by this inhibitor was very mild ( figure 4e ) .
importantly , when the cells were treated with cathepsin k inhibitor i , the decrease of il - 1beta secretion was not evident at all ( figure 4b and 4f ) , suggesting that the cathepsin b activity was specifically involved in nlrp3 inflammasome activation during m.hy challenge .
in addition , when we blocked k + efflux by increasing the extracellular k + concentration , il - 1beta secretion by thp - 1 cells upon m.hy challenge was significantly reduced in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 4c ) .
again , there was no toxic effect from kcl as il - 8 production from the same cells was normal ( figure 4g ) .
to figure out whether calcium influx helped inflammasome activation , we added different doses of egta in the cell culture medium and found that egta treatment blocked m.hy - induced il - 1beta secretion in a dose - dependent manner , and no toxic effect from egta was observed as evidenced by il - 8 production ( figure 4d and 4h ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0077955.g004 figure 4 mechanism of nlrp3 inflammasome activation in response to m.hy challenge .
5x104 thp - 1 were pretreated with different doses of cathepsin b inhibitor ca - 074 me ( a , e ) or cathepsin k inhibitor i ( b , f ) , kcl ( c,g ) or egta ( d , h ) , then were challenged with m.hy at a concentration of 6.7x107 ccu / ml , 6 hours later the supernatants were harvested for il - 8 and il - 1beta elisa at the same time .
data presented are mean +/ - sd of one representative out of three independent experiments .
*** represents p < 0.001 , ** represents p < 0.01 and * represents p < 0.05 in comparison with control in statistic analysis .
furthermore , we tested whether m.hy challenge induced ros generation in thp - 1 cells .
for this assay , thp - 1 cells were first loaded with the redox - sensitive fluorophore dcfda and then challenged with m.hy , atp was included as a positive control .
as shown in figure 5a , 16.9 % cm - h2dcfda positive cells were detected 30 minutes after m.hy treatment compared to 1.6 % in untreated cells .
these data suggested that ros may contribute to nlrp3 inflammasome activation in response to m.hy challenge .
to verify this possibility , we pretreated thp - 1 cells with ros inhibitor diphenyliodonium ( dpi ) for 30 minutes , and then challenged the cells with m.hy before measurement of il - 1beta production 6 hours later .
as expected , dpi dramatically reduced m.hy induced il - 1beta release ( figure 5b ) .
a recent study showed that ros inhibitor such as dpi abolished il - 1beta release in mouse macrophages by inhibiting nlrp3 gene expression [ 40 ] .
therefore , we also monitored the mrna level of pro - il - 1beta and nlrp3 under dpi treatment .
we found that dpi markedly reduced the expression of pro - il - 1beta and nlrp3 ( figure 5c - d ) , which was consistent with the finding from mouse cells [ 40 ] .
in addition , we also examined the activation of caspase - 1 and found that low doses ( 1 or 10 microm ) of dpi treatment did not affect the caspase - 1 activation while 100 microm of dpi inhibited caspase - 1 activation ( figure 5e ) .
this demonstrated that in human cells dpi interfered with nlrp3 inflammasome activation through inhibition of nlrp3 transcription as well as caspase - 1 activity when high dose was applied .
collectively , these data suggest that cathepsin b activity , k + efflux , ca2 + influx and ros all contributed to nlrp3 inflammasome activation in response to m.hy challenge .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0077955.g005 figure 5 nlrp3 inflammasome activation in response to m. hy is dependent on ros .
a , levels of ros in m.hy treated thp - 1 cells were analyzed by cm - h2dcfda labeling .
data represents mean of the percentage of cm - h2dcfda - positive cells .
b , 5x104 thp - 1 cells were pre - incubated with the indicated amounts of dpi for 0.5 hour and challenged with m.hy subsequently for 6 hours , the supernatants were harvested for il - 1beta elisa .
1x105 thp - 1 cells ( c ) and pma induced macrophages ( d ) were pre - incubated with the indicated amounts of dpi for 0.5 hour and challenged with m.hy ( final concentration , 6.7x107 ccu / ml ) subsequently for 3 hours , the cells were lysed and mrna were extracted for cdna synthesis and finally for il - 1beta and nlrp3 gene expression by real - time pcr .
e , immunoblot analysis of pro - caspase - 1 and mature ( p10 ) form of caspase - 1 and mature il - 1beta ( p17 ) in supernatants and extracts of thp - 1 derived macrophages treated with m.hy for 6 hours after dpi pretreatment for 0.5 hour .
data presented are mean +/ - sd of one representative out of three independent experiments .
m.hy activates nlrp3 inflammasome in vivo when mouse bone marrow derived dendritic cells ( bmdcs ) were infected with m.hy , a sustained il - 1beta induction was observed ( figure 6a ) .
further experiments on bmdcs isolated from wild - type ( wt ) mice or mice deficient for caspase - 1 , asc or nlrp3 with m.hy challenge confirmed that m.hy induction of il - 1beta was nlrp3 inflammasome dependent ( figure 6b ) .
furthermore , systemic inoculation of m.hy in wt mice induced il - 1beta production in serum and peritoneal lavage fluid ( plf ) , but not in mice lacking asc or nlrp3 ( figure 6c - d ) .
interestingly , the basal level of il - 1beta in asc deficient mice was clearly higher than that in wt or nlrp3 deficient mice , but challenge with m.hy did not further increase the secretion of il - 1beta in such mice ( figure 6c - d ) .
collectively , these findings confirmed that m.hy also activated nlrp3 inflammasome in mice in vitro and in vivo .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0077955.g006 figure 6 m.hy induces nlrp3 inflammasome activation in mouse bmdcs and in vivo .
a , 1x105 mouse bone marrow derived dendritic cells ( bmdcs ) were challenged with m.hy at a final concentration of 5x107 ccu / ml at different time points , supernatants were harvested for il - 1beta elisa .
b , 1x105 bmdcs isolated from wild - type and caspase - 1 deficient ( knock - out , ko ) , asc ko and nlrp3 ko mouse were challenged with m.hy at a final concentration of 5x107 ccu / ml , 24 hours later the supernatants were harvested for il - 1beta elisa .
c - d , c57bl / 6 , asc ko and nlrp3 ko mice were injected i.p. with 5x108 ccu / ml of m.hy in 200 microl of pbs .
mice were euthanized 6 hours after injection , and serum or peritoneal lavage fluid ( plf ) were collected for il - 1beta elisa ( c , d ) .
the experiment was repeated three times , and the data were pooled and showed as mean +/ - sd .

m.hy induced il - 1beta promotes gastric tumor cell migration and invasion the above data clearly showed that m.hy was able to induce il - 1beta production from innate immune cells through nlrp3 inflammasome activation .
early epidemic studies revealed a possible role of mycoplasma in the development of gastric cancer [ 5 ]. and mycoplasma hyorhinis was demonstrated to promote tumor cell migration , invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo [ 41 ] .
we hypothesized that there may exist another mechanism for this promotion , which is that m.hy may promote gastric carcinogenesis and / or metastasis by promoting il - 1beta production. and we confirmed that m.hy promoted gastric cancer cell migration and invasion ( figure s5 ) .
since m.hy was demonstrated to infect gastric cancer cells ([ 41 ] , figure s4 ) , it is thus possible that m.hy may induce inflammasome activation in cancer cells directly .
however , no inflammasome activation was detected in gastric cancer cells ( figure s6 ) .
we next determined the effect of human recombinant il - 1beta ( ril - 1beta ) on gastric cancer cell carcinogenesis in a colony formation assay,which revealed that the ril - 1beta did not influence the proliferation of gastric cancer cell line mgc - 803 ( figure s7 ) .
since il - 1beta was reported to promote metastasis of other tumors [ 18 ] , we checked the effects of ril - 1beta on the migration and invasion of mgc - 803 cells .
our results showed that the mgc - 803 migration and invasion were enhanced with ril - 1beta treatment ( figure 7a and 7c ) , while treatment with ril - 18 did not show any effect ( figure 7b and 7d ) .
next , we treated these gastric cancer cells with the culture supernatants from m.hy challenged thp - 1 derived macrophages or macrophages with silencing of nlrp3 , asc and caspase - 1 for migration and invasion assay .
our results showed that the culture supernatants from m.hy challenged scramble macrophage cells strongly enhanced migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells , while the culture supernatants from the nlrp3 , asc or caspase - 1 knockdown macrophages did not , likely due to the diminished il - 1beta secretion ( figure 8a and 8c ) .
this enhanced migration and invasion of mgc - 803 cells was abolished by treating the cells with anti - il - 1beta mab ( figure 8b and 8d ) .
taken together , our results demonstrated that m.hy induced migration and invasion of gastric cancer cell line mgc - 803 by promoting il - 1beta secretion from monocytic cells .
moreover , our data indicated that m.hy induced inflammasome activation may promote m.hy replication ( figure s8 ) , which may create a positive feedback and finally leads to chronicity of disease .

because their dynamic surface architecture is antigenically and functionally versatile , mycoplasmas are capable of evading host immune attack and adapting to many habitats and cause chronic diseases [ 32 ] .
since the identification of m.hy from swine in 1962 , little investigation was carried out on this pathogen till it was found to be associated with several human cancers [ 5 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
more recently , scientists found that m.hy protein p37 was responsible for promoting cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis [ 30 ] , [ 44 ] .
besides this direct mechanism , this microbe may also induce tumorigenesis or metastasis indirectly through a local chronic inflammatory process .
it 's well known that il - 1beta is an important pro - inflammatory cytokine that promotes growth of colon cancer cells and enhances invasiveness and metastasis of b16 melanoma cells [ 19 ] , [ 45 ] .
overexpression of il - 1beta was found to induce gastric inflammation and cancer in mice [ 19 ] .
in this study , we investigated whether the nlrp3 inflammasome , which controls il - 1beta maturation , was activated by m.hy , and whether this activation can contribute to m.hy associated gastric metastasis .
our results showed that m.hy activated the nlrp3 inflammasome in vitro and in vivo , and the promotion of gastric cancer cell migration and invasion by m.hy was dependent on nlrp3 inflammasome activation .
besides nlrp3 , we found that m.hy dna also activated the aim2 inflammasome , but mlamp activation of nlrp3 was the dominant component for il - 1beta induction by m.hy. it was recently reported that acylated lipopeptide from heat - killed mycoplasma acholeplasma laidlawii ( hkal ) induced il - 1beta production through nlrp7 inflammasome in human cells , while total hkal induced il - 1beta secretion was partially nlrp3 dependent [ 46 ] , indicating that multiple inflammasomes can be activated by certain mycoplasma .
our data did not rule out the possible involvement of nlrp7 in m.hy induced il - 1beta production , but m.hy mainly activated the nlrp3 inflammasome , because the il - 1beta secretion was nearly completely abolished in the nlrp3 silenced cells ( figure 3h and 3i ) .
early studies proposed that ros activated the nlrp3 inflammasome by activating caspase - 1 [ 47 ] .
however , recent investigation showed that ros inhibitors interfered with the transcription of il - 1beta and nlrp3 , but not affected activation of caspase - 1 in mouse cells [ 40 ] .
in our study , although ros inhibition with low dose dpi ( 10 microm ) significantly reduced the il - 1beta production upon m.hy challenge , it did not inhibit the caspase - 1 cleavage , the marker of inflammasome activation .
however , when high dose of dpi ( 100 microm ) was applied , caspase - 1 cleavage was clearly inhibited ( figure 5e ) , suggesting that high dose of dpi can suppress the assembly of inflammasome complex , although we cannot exclude a possibility that this effect might have been resulted from the nlrp3 mrna abolishing from baseline ( figure 5d ) .
it is likely that the ros inhibitor might interfere with both pro - il - 1beta synthesis and caspase - 1 activation .
how m.hy promotes ros production in macrophage remains elusive .
the lack of cell wall from m.hy permits direct contact of the mycoplasma membrane and host cell membrane , and this contact may lead to fusion of mycoplasma with eukaryotic host cell .
this fusion may not only lead to mycoplasma components delivering into the host cell , but also allow insertion of the mycoplasma membrane components into the membrane of the eukaryotic host cell .
recently , m.hy membranes were found to possess phospholipase a ( pla ) that may be involved in the plasma membrane disruption process that occurs upon the invasion of host cells [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] .
during this process , the host cells may produce ros .
it would be worth of investigating whether pla is required for the m.hy induced ros production and il - 1beta secretion .
as evidenced by our data , lysosomal rupture , k + efflux , ca2 + influx and ros were all involved in m.hy induced nlrp3 activation .
as reported before , k + efflux and phagolysosomal rupture may induce ca2 + influx , while ca2 + influx may cause dysfunction of mitochondria , which results in release of oxidized mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) into the cytosol , where it bind to and activate the nlrp3 inflammasome [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] .
mitochondria seems to act as a central hub for integration of diverse signals sensed by nlrp3 , but the relative contribution of ros and mtdna for nlrp3 inflammasome activation is still not clear to date [ 9 ] .
although m.hy is not highly virulent , it can establish chronic infection. by a gradual and progressive interaction with host cells , it induces chromosomal instability and malignant transformation , thus promoting tumor growth , migration or invasion [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] .
the m.hy p37 protein promoted gastric cancer cell , prostate carcinoma and melanoma cell lines invasiveness [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
in addition , the pro - inflammatory micro - environment such as il - 1beta production may also contribute to this process [ 19 ] .
our study found that m.hy induced il - 1beta promoted migration and invasion of the gastric cancer cells , while m.hy induced il - 18 did not contribute to the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells , which was different from other reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
a possible explanation is that il - 18 may have promoted gastric cancer cells migration and invasion via the regulation of cd70 , cd44 and vegf expression in immune cells , which deserves our further investigation [ 26 ] .
another explanation could be that the dose of ril - 18 they used ( 150 ng / ml ) is much higher than what we used [ 27 ] .
moreover , il - 1beta promoted migration and invasion of the gastric cancer cells may be mediated by matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( mmp9 ) as other searchers reported [ 52 ] .
however , to get direct and more solid evidence and the corresponding mechanisms about the connection between nlrp3 inflammasome activation triggered by m.hy , and gastric cancer metastasis , appropriate animal models such as the in vivo tumor invasion assay [ 53 ] and patient studies are needed for further study in the future .

aurora a kinase inhibition enhances oncolytic herpes virotherapy through cytotoxic synergy and innate cellular immune modulation by currier et al oncolytic virotherapy hsv aurora a kinase checkpoint proteins oncolytic herpes simplex virus ( ohsv ) therapy offers great promise at targeting difficult - to - treat solid tumors as evidenced by the first fda approval of an oncolytic virus , modified hsv - 1 talimogene laherparepvec ( t - vec ; imlygic ) to treat advanced melanoma [ 1 ] .
there are a number of active studies in children and adults using first generation ohsvs that contain deletions in the neurovirulence gene gamma134.5 ( g207 , clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct02457845 ; hsv1716 , nct00931931 ) or second generation viruses , like t - vec ( nct02509507 ; nct02211131 ; nct02658812 ; nct03069378 ; nct02626000 ; nct02819843 ) that produces granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) or m032 ( nct02062827 ) that produces interleukin - 12 to augment the oncolytic effect of the virus by stimulating a more robust anti - tumor immune response .
the ideal balance between viral oncolysis and immune stimulation is unknown yet very consequential .
cytolysis from virus replication exposes previously unexposed cancer antigens to immune effector cells which are attracted to the area by the virus in the context of a danger response and can attack the tumor ; however the immune cells can also remove the virus , and thereby limit viral oncolysis .
researchers have explored combination approaches with ohsvs including various chemotherapeutics and low - dose radiation to maximize both viral oncolysis and the effect of the added therapy .
in most combination studies with chemotherapy drugs , apoptosis was increased but viral replication was not enhanced [ 2 - 4 ] .
interestingly , when combined with ohsv , paclitaxel could be dosed 5 - fold lower with similar tumor responses as paclitaxel alone suggesting that ohsv may permit lower doses of chemotherapy to be used resulting in less toxicity for patients [ 3 ] .
while bevacizumab , a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , decreased virus replication , it still synergized with ohsv in part through enhanced antiangiogenesis and modulation of the innate cellular host response [ 4 ] .
in other studies , low dose - ionizing radiation augmented virus replication through multiple proposed mechanisms , including increased cellular activity due to host cell responses to dna damage which may in turn complement viral gene deletions and activate hsv - 1 promoters ( reviewed in [ 5 ]) .
radiation may also potentiate innate and adaptive immune responses to augment an anti - tumor response .
in a recent issue of oncotarget , currier et al. describe the synergistic effects of combining aurora a kinase inhibitor alisertib ( mlb8237 ) with hsv1716 , a first - generation ohsv currently in phase i clinical trial in children with non - central nervous system solid tumors ( nct00931931 ) , in neuroblastoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath cell lines [ 6 ] .
alisertib selectively binds and inhibits aurora a kinase which plays important roles in regulating mitosis .
this combination approach resulted in three important findings : 1 ) in addition to the direct cytotoxicity of alisertib and hsv1716 , the virus increased the sensitivity of surrounding cells to alisertib through a paracrine effect whereby infected cells secreted signals that killed some uninfected cells .
the authors termed this effect virus - induced therapeutic adjuvant ( vita ) .
2 ) alisertib increased peak virus production and decreased virus clearance in vivo thereby prolonging oncolysis possibly by preventing the influx of virus - mediated nk cells that may limit virus replication .
3 ) alisertib prevented the increase of monocyte myeloid derived suppressor cells ( mdscs ) induced by hsv1716 .
mdscs have been shown to be pro - tumorigenic .
taken together , these exciting results demonstrate how a combination strategy may be used to not only improve the effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy but also increase the efficacy of the combined drug .
further studies are needed to determine if there is one principal mechanism resulting in the increased antitumor effect or if each of these findings ( and perhaps others not yet described ) combined are responsible for the outcomes .
additionally , the generalizability of these findings to other models will be interesting to investigate .
in addition to maximizing virus replication and the effect of an added agent , a critical challenge remains exploiting the immune system to create a sustained anti - tumor response .
the combination of hsv1716 and alisertib removed unfavorable mdscs which are known to promote pro - tumorigenic m2 macrophages .
additional opportunities exist with adjuvant immunotherapies such as natural killer ( nk ) cell therapy and checkpoint molecule inhibitors .
recently , researchers demonstrated synergy between bortezomib , a proteasome inhibitor , and ohsv in causing inflammatory necroptotic tumor cell death [ 7 ] .
this was accompanied by secretion of inflammatory cytokines which activated nk cells and increased sensitization of tumor cells to nk cell immunotherapy .
tumors may evade immune surveillance through the expression of immunosuppressive checkpoint proteins on the surface of tumor cells or in the tumor microenvironment that negatively regulate immune cell function , and inhibitors of these proteins have been developed and have resulted in some dramatic and durable responses in a variety of solid tumors [ reviewed in 8 ] .
these agents may be an ideal combination with ohsv since the virus can activate an antitumor immune response , a foreign gene product such as a cytokine that is produced with viral replication can amplify the response , and checkpoint blockade may further intensify and maintain the antitumor immune response .
studies are underway both preclinically and clinically examining various combinations of checkpoint inhibitors and ohsvs .
combination approaches like the one described by currier et al. likely hold the key to unlocking the full potential of ohsv , and the challenge for researchers moving forward is to determine the ideal combinations to maximize the benefit of ohsv .

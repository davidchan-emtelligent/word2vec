background : a registry assessing the care of hypertensive patients in daily clinical practice in public and private centers in various brazilian regions has not been conducted to date .
such analysis is important to elucidate the effectiveness of this care .
objective : to document the current clinical practice for the treatment of hypertension with identification of the profile of requested tests , type of administered treatment , level of blood pressure ( bp ) control , and adherence to treatment .
methods : national , observational , prospective , and multicenter study that will include patients older than 18 years with hypertension for at least 4 weeks , following up in public and private centers and after signing a consent form .
the study will exclude patients undergoing dialysis , hospitalized in the previous 30 days , with class iii or iv heart failure , pregnant or nursing , with severe liver disease , stroke or acute myocardial infarction in the past 30 days , or with diseases with a survival prognosis < 1 year .
evaluations will be performed at baseline and after 1 year of follow - up. the parameters that will be evaluated include anthropometric data , lifestyle habits , bp levels , lipid profile , metabolic syndrome , and adherence to treatment .
the primary outcomes will be hospitalization due to hypertensive crisis , cardiocirculatory events , and cardiovascular death , while secondary outcomes will be hospitalization for heart failure and requirement of dialysis .
a subgroup analysis of 15 % of the sample will include noninvasive central pressure evaluation at baseline and study end .
the estimated sample size is 3,000 individuals for a prevalence of 5 % , sample error of 2 % , and 95 % confidence interval .
results : the results will be presented after the final evaluation , which will occur at the end of a 1 - year follow - up. conclusion : the analysis of this registry will improve the knowledge and optimize the treatment of hypertension in brazil , as a way of modifying the prognosis of cardiovascular disease in the country .
evidence - based practice hypertension risk factors multicenter studies as topic epidemiology prevalence introduction hypertension is a polygenic disease of multifactorial etiology , characterized by sustained increased blood pressure ( bp ) levels.1 it is currently the main risk factor for cardiovascular diseases ( cvds ) , which are the most frequent causes of death in brazil and worldwide.1 - 3 hypertension is also associated with target - organ ( kidney , heart , brain ) damage and other comorbidities such as dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes,1 which in turn also increase the risk of cardiovascular events .
a classic meta - analysis that evaluated more than 1 million individuals in 61 observational studies concluded that the mortality associated with cvds increases progressively in a linear , continuous , and independent fashion with increases in bp levels above 115 / 75 mmhg.4 the interheart study analyzed the risk factors for acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) in 52 countries ( six of which in latin america ) , including 15,000 cases of patients with first ami and a similar number of control individuals.5,6 the increased risk of ami in latin america was associated with hypertension ( odds ratio [ or ] 2.48 ; 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % ci ] , 2.03 - 3.04 ) , diabetes ( or 2.45 ; 95 % ci , 1.86 - 3.24 ) , smoking ( or 2.35 ; 95 % ci , 1.92 - 2.87 ) , dyslipidemia - apob / apoa1 ( or 2.79 ; 95 % ci , 1.85 - 4.23 ) , and abdominal obesity ( or 2.41 ; 95 % ci , 1.79 - 3.25 ) .
considering that these are all modifiable risk factors , the interheart study alerted to the need for implementation of preventive strategies throughout latin america .
the prevalence of hypertension in brazil is similar to that in other countries .
surveys conducted in the brazilian population point out to a prevalence of hypertension of approximately 30 %. 7,8 considering bp values >= 140 / 90 mmhg , 22 studies found prevalences between 22.3 % and 43.9 % ( mean 32.5 %) , with a higher prevalence in men compared with women , and in elderly individuals.9 a study in which 613 patients in the city of sao paulo were interviewed by phone found a 32 % prevalence of hypertension among the respondents. of these , 89 % reported current treatment for hypertension but only 35 % mentioned proper control of bp levels.10 another study conducted in sao jose do rio preto in 1,717 individuals found a prevalence of hypertension of 25.2 % and reported as associated factors the presence of advanced age , low educational level , and obesity.11 among the treated hypertensive individuals , 52.4 % showed adequate bp control , but only 34.3 % of the overall treated and untreated hypertensive individuals had controlled bp levels .
since hypertension is multifactorial , frequent in the adult population , and commonly associated with other cardiovascular risk factors and / or target - organ damage , it is an important public health problem .
when the diagnosis of hypertension is established early , and the goals of bp control are met , the treatment of the disease may be effective ; however , when left untreated , hypertension can cause severe complications and follow a slow and silent course.1 data from the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) collected between 2009 and 2012 have shown that 84.7 % of the surveyed adults with hypertension were aware of the diagnosis of the disease and that the percentage of patients undergoing antihypertensive treatment was 76.5 % , with a 54.1 % rate of bp control .
these numbers demonstrate a significant improvement in the diagnosis and control of hypertension in the american population.12,13 lifestyle modifications lead to decreases in bp and cardiovascular mortality.14 - 16 even though consistently recommended for prevention and treatment of hypertension , lifestyle modifications are difficult to implement from the patient 's perspective and , often , also from the physician 's perspective , who is frequently unable to rely on the support of a multiprofessional team. with the objective of achieving proper bp control and consequently decreasing the deaths associated with cvd , it is essential to know the prevalence of hypertension in brazil , clarify how the care and treatment of hypertensive patients are being conducted in daily clinical practice , and understand the role of multidisciplinary teams in this scenario .
objectives main objective to document the current clinical practice for the treatment of hypertension in brazil .
secondary objectives stratify additional cardiovascular risks , considering associated comorbidities , target - organ damage , and presence of manifested cardiovascular disease ; analyze the profile of tests routinely requested for patients with hypertension ; verify the proportion of patients receiving antihypertensive treatment who are within the goals recommended by the brazilian society of cardiology ; estimate the adherence to proposed pharmacological and non - pharmacological therapies using the morisky scale ; evaluate the presence of a multiprofessional team in the regular care of the patients and , when present , the effectiveness of its performance in controlling the bp levels ; assess eventual differences in the approach to hypertensive patients in private and public centers .

clinical outcomes primary outcomes the primary outcomes will include hospital admission for at least 24 hours due to hypertensive crisis ; cardiovascular event ( acute coronary syndrome [ acs ] and / or stroke / transient ischemic attack [ tia ]) documented in medical records or summary of hospital discharge ; cardiovascular death ( due to acs , stroke / tia , heart failure ) confirmed by descriptions in the medical records and / or death certificate .
secondary outcomes the secondary outcomes will include hospitalization due to decompensated heart failure documented in medical records or summary of hospital discharge , and requirement of dialysis therapy .
recruitment the patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics , and their participation in the study will begin after they sign the ficf previously approved by the research ethics committee ( comite de etica em pesquisa , cep ) .
in the inclusion visit , the following information will be collected : demographic data , personal history , family history , hypertension history , bp assessment , medications in use within the previous 30 days , laboratory data and electrocardiogram ( ecg ) in the last 6 months ( if available ) , analysis of other relevant tests in the investigator 's opinion and performed in the previous year , lifestyle questionnaire , ambulatory bp in the previous 6 months ( if available ) , and treatment adherence assessed with the morisky scale .
in the follow - up visit , the evaluating data will include bp measurements , medications in use , estimate of adherence to pharmacological and non - pharmacological treatment using the morisky scale , hospitalization due to cvd ( hypertensive crisis , ami , angina , stroke , tia , heart failure ) , beginning of dialysis , and death .
subgroup analysis a protocol subgroup including 15 % of the sample will undergo a noninvasive assessment of the central bp with a validated mobil - o - graph equipment ( dina map cardios - i.e.m. gmbh , stolberg , germany ) in the inclusion and follow - up visits .
the central hemodynamic parameters will be obtained using a noninvasive method that verifies simultaneously the pulse wave of the arterial blood flow , allowing analysis of the bp , central systolic pressure ( csp ) , pulse wave velocity ( pwv ) , and augmentation index ( aix ) by the method arcsolver , austrian institute of technology .
this method determines the csp based on brachial pulse waves recorded with a cuff connected to the mobil - o - graph , the oscillometric device that records the bp. the records will be obtained by inflating the cuff for 10 seconds at the dbp level , using conventional cuffs for adults ( available in the sizes 24 - 34 cm and 32 - 42 cm ) and a high - fidelity mpx50550 pressor sensor ( freescale inc. , tempe , az , usa ) .
the method considers the influence of arterial impedance using a transfer function , as well as the hemodynamics of the aorta using a mathematic method .
the mobil - o - graph is a device that allows simultaneous measurement of central and peripheral pressure .
depending on the protocol adopted , these measurements may be carried out at pre - established intervals .
the same preparation methodology described for the measurement of casual bp will be adopted , with the use of a suitable cuff , according to the circumference of the chosen arm .
central parameters are usually performed in a single evaluation. with this equipment , the assessments can be performed by several protocols with multiple measurements .
for those research centers with patients participating in this subgroup , the following variables will be collected and entered in the registry 's ecrf : csp , central diastolic pressure ( cdp ) , pwv , aix ( corrected for 75 % of the heart rate ) , and peripheral arterial resistance .
this analysis aims to offer an understanding of the reality of the brazilian population regarding the information mentioned above , and to correlate different classes of antihypertensive drugs in terms of action on peripheral bp levels and on variables regulating the central bp control .
statistical analysis and sample size a sample of 3,000 individuals will be sufficient to estimate prevalences of 5 % ( or greater ) with an absolute sample error ( precision ) of 2 % ( or greater ) and a 95 % ci considering a 20 % loss to follow - up.19 survival curves will be calculated with the product - limit kaplan - meier method20 and compared with the log - rank test proposed by mantel,21 followed by sidak 's multiple comparisons test , when appropriate .
survival probabilities will be estimated with 95 % ci using log - log transformation.22 cox univariate and multivariate analyses ( controlling for factors of interest such as comorbidities , sociodemographic variables , demographic regions , age , etc. ) will be conducted to identify factors associated with the survival outcomes evaluated .
the proportional hazards assumptions and functional form ( for continuous covariables ) in cox regression models will be assessed according to the kolmogorov - type supremum test based on a sample of 1,000 simulations of residuals.23 if the linear form is rejected for a continuous covariate , the covariate will be categorized according to the cutoff points of clinical importance or according to distribution percentiles .
adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratios with corresponding 95 % cis will be estimated by cox univariate and multivariate regression analyses , respectively .
in addition , statistical analyses will be conducted in previously defined subgroups in different brazilian regions ( north , northeast , midwest , south , and southeast ) and according to the type of service performed ( academic or non - academic , public or private ) .
if a violation of the assumption is observed , weighted cox regression will be used.24 before determining the multivariate model , a diagnosis of multicollinearity will be conducted according to the variance inflation factor ( vif ) .
the cases confirmed as loss to follow - up will be censored at the date of the last follow - up / contact .
associations between categorical variables will be evaluated in 2x2 and greater than 2x2 contingency tables with fisher 's exact test and its extension , the fisher - freeman - halton test , respectively .
unpaired student 's t test and analysis of variance ( anova ) will be used to compare averages among groups of two or more than two , respectively .
in cases of considerable data asymmetry , nonparametric alternatives will be applied : wilcoxon 's rank sum and kruskal - wallis tests , respectively.25 the normality of the data will be evaluated with a visual inspection of the histograms and / or application of the d'agostino and pearson 's comprehensive normality test , when appropriate.26 continuous variables will be described as mean +/ - standard deviation or median ( interquartile range ) , when appropriate .
categorical variables will be described as numbers ( percentages ) .
in addition , statistical analyses will be conducted in previously defined subgroups .
all probabilities of significance ( p values ) presented will be bilateral and values below 0.05 will be considered statistically significant .
the data will be statistically analyzed with sas 9.3 ( statistical analysis system , cary , nc , usa ) .
legal and ethical aspects this registry is conducted in accordance with national and international resolutions such as the declaration of helsinki , resolution cns196 / 96 and all the complementary cns / ms , ich good clinical practices guide ( 1996 ) , and the document of the americas ( 2005 ) .

pathogenic mutations in the aifm1 gene cause severe human diseases .
clinical manifestations include inherited peripheral neuropathies , prenatal cerebral abnormalities and progressive mitochondrial encephalomyopathies .
in humans , rodents and invertebrates , aif deficiency results in loss of respiratory complexes and , therefore , impaired oxphos .
the molecular mechanisms underlying aif - induced mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive .
here we show that aif physically interacts with the oxidoreductase chchd4 / mia40 .
in patient - derived fibroblasts as well as in tissues and glia cells from harlequin ( hq ) mutant mice , aif deficiency correlates with decreased mia40 protein levels , without affecting mrna transcription .
importantly , mia40 overexpression counteracts loss of respiratory subunits in hq cells .
together , our findings suggest that mia40 reduction contributes to the effects of aif deficiency on oxphos , as it may impact on the correct assembly and maintenance of the respiratory subunits .
this may be relevant for the development of new therapeutic approaches for aif - related mitochondrial disorders .
apoptosis - inducing factor ( aif ) is an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial protein initially described as a death effector.1 , 2 the aifm1 gene maps to the x - chromosome and gives rise to a 67 kda polypeptide that is imported into mitochondria in an unfolded form .
the processed 62 kda mature protein is mostly tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane through a transmembrane domain , whereas a limited fraction is associated with the outer membrane.3 , 4 as folded aif incorporates flavin adenine dinucleotide ( fad ) and possess nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( nadh ) - binding domains , it was initially proposed that aif could function as low - turnover oxidoreductase .
however , a significant number of recent biochemical data questioned this view and ruled out an antioxidant function , despite its potential redox properties.5 although its enzymatic function remains unclear , aif has emerged as a critical pro - survival housekeeping component of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ( oxphos ) .
in various cellular and animal models , aif deficiency results in a general loss of respiratory elements , which shows some tissue specificity and is probably mediated by multiple factors , including altered expression , assembly and maintenance of the electron transport chain ( etc ) subunits.6 , 7 although homozygous aif - knockout mice are embryonic lethal,8 hypomorphic harlequin ( hq ) mutant mice are viable , although they display severe phenotypes.9 hq mice express ~ 20 % of normal aif levels and exhibit reduced oxphos in various tissues .
as a consequence of mitochondrial abnormalities , within 3 - 6 months of age hq mice develop skeletal muscle atrophy , astrogliosis as well as progressive retinal and cerebellar neurodegeneration.9 , 10 recently , several pathogenic mutations in the aifm1 gene were identified in individuals exhibiting severe mitochondrial dysfunction , with a clinical spectrum that includes maternally inherited peripheral neuropathies , prenatal ventriculomegaly , fatal and slowly progressive encephalomyopathies and severe muscular atrophy.11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 it remains to be defined whether the heterogeneity , onset and severity of these clinical manifestations are causally correlated with the extent of mitochondrial dysfunction .
in general , mutations or a deletion of evolutionarily conserved amino acids result in significantly decreased aif stability and , therefore , altered oxphos , although the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown .
similarly to other mitochondrial disorders , clinical interventions are very limited.16 , 17 , 18 here we searched for putative aif interacting partners that might mediate oxphos deficiency .
our results show that mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly 40 ( mia40 ) co - immunoprecipitates with aif .
importantly , mia40 requires aif for the physiological protein availability and function , resulting in an altered oxphos system in cells lacking aif .
our findings unveil a novel pathway that may explain the loss of etc subunits in individuals carrying aif dysfunction , which may have significant implications for novel therapeutic approaches .
results aif deficiency significantly impairs oxphos in invertebrates , rodents and humans.6 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 19 as aif does not seem to interact with any etc components,5 , 6 , 20 , 21 we hypothesized that aif influences oxphos maintenance through an interaction with a protein relevant for protein folding or etc assembly .
thus , we used a yeast two - hybrid screening to identify aif interacting partners with a contributing role in mitochondrial respiration .
using aif as bait , we identified coiled - coil - helix - coiled - coil - helix domain containing 4 ( chchd4 )/ mia40 as a putative candidate with high confidence of interaction .
mia40 is a mitochondrial intermembrane space ( ims ) protein that critically regulates the import and folding of small ims and inner membrane proteins.22 through a cascade of reversible redox reactions and interaction with augmenter of liver regeneration ( alr )/ erv1 , mia40 acts as a chaperone and contributes to the assembly of inner membrane complexes , including etc components.23 , 24 notably , altered mia40 - erv1 function causes an infantile mitochondrial disorder.25 to confirm the identified candidate from the yeast two - hybrid screen , we performed a co - immunoprecipitation assay in whole - cell lysates and , using an anti - aif antibody , we showed that endogenous mia40 interacted with aif in vitro ( figure 1a ) .
similarly , endogenous aif was co - immunoprecipitated using an anti - mia40 antibody , confirming the physical binding ( figure 1a ) .
to further assess the aif - mia40 binding , hek293t cells were transiently transfected with green fluorescent protein - tagged aif , however the yield was very low due to extensive cell death ( data not shown ) .
to overcome this limitation , we generated mutant aif constructs with decreased apoptogenic action 5 , 26 ( figure 1b ) .
specifically , v5 - tagged aif lacking the n - terminal transmembrane domain , the apoptotic cleavage sequence and the dna - binding sites were individually transfected to cells .
the three aif mutant proteins localized correctly to the mitochondria ( figure 1c ) .
using an anti - v5 antibody , we performed immunoprecipitation assays in cellular lysates and found that the transmembrane domain comprising residues 66 - 86 is critical for aif binding to mia40 ( figure 1d ) .
given the described physical interaction between the two intermembrane proteins , we reasoned that aif loss might affect whole mia40 abundance .
in line with this hypothesis , a significant decrease of mia40 protein levels was found in brain tissue and glia cells derived from hq mice as well as in human fibroblasts carrying the pathogenic aifm1 ( r201delta ) deletion12 ( figures 1e and f ) .
this effect appeared to be posttranscriptional , given that quantitative rt - pcr of mia40 messenger rna ( mrna ) levels showed no significant change in the cerebellum of hq mice compared with littermate controls ( figure 1g ) .
as mia40 is involved in the import and folding of both complex i subunits and complex iv assembly factors,23 , 24 we hypothesized that overexpression of mia40 might rescue some of the etc defects in aif - deficient cells .
in line with our hypothesis , overexpression of mia40 in hq mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( mefs ) led to a partial rescue of the complex i subunit nadh dehydrogenase ( ubiquinone ) 1 beta subcomplex ( ndufb7 ) as well as the complex iv subunit mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase i ( mtco1 ) at the protein level ( figures 2a and b ) .
on the basis of these findings , aif - mediated mia40 stability is a critical process required for the proper folding and maintenance of the respiratory complexes ( figure 2c ) .
discussion mitochondria are critical regulators of cellular growth , proliferation and death .
they significantly contribute to energy homeostasis by generating atp through a series of redox reactions generally known as oxphos .
the oxphos system comprises four respiratory chain complexes , two mobile electron carriers and the atp synthase , which converts inorganic phosphate and adp to atp .
a functional oxphos system requires a large number of molecular chaperones that control the proper assembly of over 90 individual proteins into soluble and membrane - embedded multisubunit complexes .
inherited mutations that affect mitochondrial bioenergetics and function significantly contribute to the onset of several human pathologies .
in recent years , many pathogenic mutations in the aifm1 gene have been causally linked to disorders exhibiting abnormal mitochondrial bioenergetics .
although the role of aif in cell death has been widely documented,5 , 27 little is known about the mechanism through which aif can affect the respiratory capacity of the cell .
as the identification of the hq mutation,9 it soon became evident that aif has a fundamental role in survival .
the following studies in cellular models confirmed that aif deficiency primarily alters mitochondrial activity.6 as aif has a nadh - and two fad - binding domains , it possesses an oxidorductase activity and was , therefore , thought to act as an oxidant scavenger , protecting the respiratory complexes from locally generated reactive oxygen species .
however , more recent biochemical evidence questions this hypothesis,5 , 28 thereby leaving the molecular mechanisms underlying aif - mediated mitochondrial deficiency unexplained .
here we show for the first time that aif influences the stability of mia40 , which is a crucial component of the ims - import and assembly machinery of cysteine - rich proteins.22 such proteins are maintained in a reduced form in the cytosol and undergo both import and oxidative protein folding upon entry into the ims in a mia40 - dependent manner .
the oxidative folding mechanism involves a disulfide relay system in which electrons are shuttled from the entering substrate to mia40 , to the sulfhydryl oxidase erv1 / alr and to a final electron acceptor , such as cytochrome c. among mia40 substrates are several complex i ( ci ) subunits and complex iv ( civ ) assembly factors .
as demonstrated in tissues as well as in cells , aif deficiency correlates with a significant loss of mia40 at the protein level .
importantly , mia40 overexpression is sufficient to rescue the loss of etc subunits in hq cells .
on the basis of our working hypothesis ( figure 2c ) , we postulate that one of the aif physiological functions is to modulate the abundance as well as the function of the mia40 protein .
theoretically , aif may operate as a docking protein , recruiting factor or redox intermediate for mia40 .
reduced mia40 functionality might result in an impaired import or oxidative folding capacity , leading to a reduced abundance of its substrates , such as ci subunits and civ assembly factors .
therefore , the molecular binding between aif and mia40 would influence the correct assembly and maintenance of the etc .
our observations unveil a novel mechanism by which aif deficiency causes oxphos impairment .
this may be of relevance in pathologies associated with mutations in the aifm1 gene .

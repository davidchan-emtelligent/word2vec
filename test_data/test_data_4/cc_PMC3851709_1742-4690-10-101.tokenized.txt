background immune cell adaptor protein adap ( adhesion and degranulation - promoting adaptor protein ) mediates aspects of t - cell adhesion and proliferation .
despite this , a connection between adap and infection by the hiv - 1 ( human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ) has not been explored .
results in this paper , we show for the first time that adap and its binding to slp - 76 ( sh2 domain - containing leukocyte protein of 76 kda ) regulate hiv - 1 infection via two distinct mechanisms and co - receptors .
sirna down - regulation of adap , or expression of a mutant that is defective in associating to its binding partner slp - 76 ( termed m12 ) , inhibited the propagation of hiv - 1 in t - cell lines and primary human t - cells .
in one step , adap and its binding to slp - 76 were needed for the activation of nf - kappab and its transcription of the hiv - 1 long terminal repeat ( ltr ) in cooperation with ligation of co - receptor cd28 , but not lfa - 1 .
in a second step , the adap - slp - 76 module cooperated with lfa - 1 to regulate conjugate formation between t - cells and dendritic cells or other t - cells as well as the development of the virological synapse ( vs ) and viral spread between immune cells .
conclusions these findings indicate that adap regulates two steps of hiv - 1 infection cooperatively with two distinct receptors , and as such , serves as a new potential target in the blockade of hiv - 1 infection .
adap hiv - 1 transcription hiv - 1 transmission integrin virological synapse background infection with the human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( hiv - 1 ) causes a severe and selective depletion of cd4 + t lymphocytes in the immune system [ 1,2 ] .
hiv - 1 binds primarily to cd4 together with chemokine receptors cxcr4 or ccr5 .
receptor engagement induces a conformational change in the hiv envelope glycoprotein ( env ) , which mediates membrane fusion and viral penetration .
replication of hiv - 1 is mediated primarily by transcription factors such as nfat , ap1 and nf - kappab [ 3,4 ] .
nf - kappab regulates long terminal repeat ( ltr ) activation within the hiv - 1 genome by interacting with tandem binding sites in the enhancer region and mutant ikappab alpha inhibits de novo hiv - 1 infection in t cells [ 5 - 7 ] .
mutations within internal tata sequences or the nf - kappab binding sites also impair ltr activity and viral replication [ 8 ] .
hiv - 1 can disseminate between immune cells either by cell - free infection or by direct cell - cell spread .
cell - cell transmission of hiv - 1 takes place through membrane nanotubes or virological synapses ( vs ) that form following physical contact between infected and uninfected cells [ 9 - 13 ] .
electron micrographs have shown hiv - 1 accumulation at the interface between hiv - 1 infected and uninfected cells [ 11,14 ] , while immunofluorescence microscopy and time - lapse imaging have shown the accumulation of viral proteins at the contact interface as well as the movement of viruses from one cell to another [ 11,15 - 17 ] .
this mode of dissemination is at least 500 - fold more efficient than infection by cell - free virus [ 10,16,17 ] , which may facilitate hiv - 1 spread within secondary lymphoid tissues [ 18 ] .
further , infected dendritic cells ( dcs ) and macrophages use the vs to transfer hiv - 1 to t cells [ 19,20 ] .
spread via synapses requires the localization of cd4 , cxcr4 or ccr5 as well as the integrin lymphocyte function - associate antigen 1 ( lfa - 1 ) and intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( icam - 1 ) at the site of cell - cell contact [ 10 - 13,17,20 ] .
the blockade of lfa - 1 reduces vs formation [ 12 ] , and more importantly , dcs isolated from leukocyte adhesion deficiency ( lad ) - i patients show decreased viral spreading to cd4 + t - cells [ 21 ] .
furthermore , lfa - 1 and icam - 1 from host cells can be incorporated into hiv particles for enhanced infectivity [ 22,23 ] .
the activation status of t - cells plays an important role in facilitating viral replication and spread since hiv - 1 replicates inefficiently in quiescent t cells [ 24 ] .
in this context , immune cell specific adaptor proteins that mediate t - cell activation and effector functions have been identified [ 25,26 ] .
these adaptors lack definable catalytic activities , but instead , possess binding domains or sites for the formation of multimeric complexes. of these , linker of activated t cells ( lat ) and src homology 2 ( sh2 ) domain - containing leukocyte protein of 76 kda ( slp - 76 ) ( also named lcp2 , lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 ) are needed for antigen - receptor induced calcium mobilization [ 27,28 ] .
slp - 76 binds to adap ( adhesion - and degranulation - promoting adaptor protein , also named as fyb [ fyn binding protein ] or slap - 130 [ slp - 76 - associated phosphoprotein of 130 kda ]) , which is needed for up - regulation of lfa - 1 adhesion [ 29 - 31 ] .
this pathway is mediated downstream by skap1 ( src kinase - associated phosphoprotein 1 ) that regulates the complex formation between rap1 and rapl ( regulator for cell adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues ) [ 26,32 - 36 ] .
two tyrosine motifs at y595ddv and y651ddv of adap bind to the sh2 domain of slp - 76 upon tcr stimulation .
a double point mutation in adap at y595f and y651f ( termed m12 ) is defective in slp - 76 binding and shows reduced lfa - 1 adhesion and psmac formation [ 31,34 ] .
despite this , a potential connection between adap and hiv - 1 infection has not been explored .
in this study , we demonstrate that adap and its binding to slp - 76 regulate two steps of hiv - 1 infection by cooperating differentially with two distinct co - receptors .
loss of adap and the slp - 76 / adap module markedly impaired cd28 - mediated hiv - 1 transcription as well as lfa - 1 - dependent formation of virological synapse for cell - cell viral spread .
these findings identify adap and its signaling module as key regulators of hiv - 1 infection .
results disruption the slp - 76 - adap signaling module inhibits hiv - 1 infection we and others have previously outlined the importance of the slp - 76 - adap - skap1 pathway in the activation of lfa - 1 [ 31 - 36 ] .
a mutant of adap lacking tyrosine residues 595 and 651 ( termed m12 ) is unable to bind to slp - 76 and impairs lfa - 1 activation [ 31,34 ] .
we assessed whether wild - type adap and the mutant m12 could regulate hiv - 1 infection in jurkat t - cells ( figure 1a,b ) .
jurkat t - cells were stably transduced with retroviral supernatants encoding adap - ires - gfp or m12 - ires - gfp ( termed jk - adap / gfp and jk - m12 / gfp ) or with gfp alone ( jk - gfp ) .
expression remained stable due to integration .
the transfectants showed the same expression levels of cd4 , cxcr4 , cd3 , cd28 , beta1 and beta2 integrins as the control gfp expressing jurkat cells as measured by flow cytometry ( figure 1b ) .
we next infected these cells with a single - cycle hiv - 1 virus carrying a luciferase reporter ( equivalent to 5 ng p24gag ) .
the mrna levels of hiv - 1 gag were measured at 72 hours post - infection by quantitative rt - pcr ( qrt - pcr ) with specific primers for hiv - 1 gag .
jk - adap / gfp cells showed 3 - 4 - fold higher levels of hiv - 1 gag mrna when compared to jk - gfp cells. by contrast , jk - m12 / gfp cells failed to support the increase of hiv - 1 gag mrna beyond that observed in the jk - gfp cells ( figure 1a ) .
the level of transfected m12 was similar to adap as seen by western blotting ( figure 1a , upper right inset ) .
we confirmed that after hiv - 1 infection , overexpression of adap / gfp or m12 / gfp had no effects on cd4 or cxcr4 expression in jurkat cells ( additional file 1 : figure s1a ) .
figure 1 disruption the slp - 76 - adap signaling module inhibits hiv - 1 infection in t - cells .
( a ) jurkat t cells were stably transfected with gfp , adap / gfp or m12 / gfp and infected with single - cycle luciferase reporter hiv - 1 ( equivalent to 5 ng p24gag / 106 cells ) .
the hiv - 1 gag mrna levels were determined by qrt - pcr 72 hrs post infection ( p = 0.032 , left and p = 0.005 , right ) .
the adap / m12 expression levels were examined by immunoblotting .
( b ) overexpression of adap / gfp or m12 / gfp in jurkat cells did not alter the surface expression levels of cd4 , cxcr4 , cd3 , cd28 , beta1 or beta2 integrins as determined by flow cytometry .
( c ) human primary cd4 + t cells were transfected with the scramble sirna or sirna targeting adap , and the knockdown efficiency was confirmed by immunoblotting ( 48 hrs post - transfection ) or by qrt - pcr at different time points during hiv - 1 infection .
( d ) human primary cd4 + t cells were transfected with sirnas for 24 hrs , then infected with single - cycle luciferase reporter hiv - 1 .
the hiv - 1 gag mrna levels were determined by qrt - pcr 72 hrs post infection ( left panel , p = 0.0192 ) .
alternatively , the amount of hiv - 1 was measured according to the luciferase readings ( right panel , p = 0.0032 ) (* represents p = < 0.05 , ** represents p = < 0.01 ) .
we next stably overexpressed gfp , adap or m12 into human c8166 t cells ( c8166 - gfp , c8166 - adap and c8166 - m12 ) ( additional file 1 : figure s1b ) .
these cells were infected with low dose or high dose of hiv - 1 ( equivalent to 1.5 or 15 ng p24gag , respectively ) .
supernatants were collected and quantified by elisa for levels of of hiv - 1 p24gag at various times post - infection .
we found that at both doses of input virus , c8166 - m12 cells were impaired in their support of hiv - 1 replication relative to cells expressing wild - type adap .
when we used low dose of virus to infect cells , c8166 - adap cells and the control cells supported productive infection , whereas c8166 - m12 cells failed to produce the detectable levels of p24gag ( additional file 1 : figure s1b , right panel ) .
over 95 % of c8166 t cells overexpressed gfp , or adap / gfp or m12 / gfp ( additional file 1 : figure s1b , left and middle panels ) , which had no effect on the expression of surface receptors ( additional file 1 : figure s1c ) and showed similar growth rates ( additional file 1 : figure s1d ) .
we further examined whether hiv - 1 infection of human primary cd4 + t cells was dependent on adap ( figure 1c,d ) .
adap expression was reduced using specific sirnas .
qrt - pcr showed a 50 - 60 % reduction in adap mrna transcripts over a period of 96 hours post - transfection ( figure 1c ) .
similarly , western blotting of cells at 48 hours confirmed the significantly reduced adap expression after transfection with sirna - adap ( figure 1c , right inset ) .
sirna transfected human cd4 + t cells were then infected with the single - cycle hiv - 1 virus containing luciferase reporter [ 12 ] .
sirna for adap reduced hiv - 1 gag mrna levels by 30 % when assessed at 72 hours post - infection ( figure 1d , left panel ) .
a measurement of luciferase activity confirmed that sirna for adap resulted in a significant reduction of hiv - 1 infection ( figure 1d , right panel ) .
the surface expression of cd3 , cd4 , cd28 , cxcr4 , beta1 / beta2 integrins and icam - 1 in human cd4 + t cells was not affected by knockdown of adap ( additional file 1 : figure s1e ) .
collectively , these data indicate that adap is needed for the optimal hiv - 1 infection of t - cell lines and primary human t - cells .
adap and slp - 76 regulates hiv - 1 ltr transcription in a cd28 - and nf - kappab - dependent manner to uncover the molecular basis of adap involvement in hiv - 1 infection , we firstly examined its potential effects on the induction of hiv - 1 ltr transcription .
wild type , slp - 76 - deficient jurkat t - cells ( termed j14 ) or adap - deficient jurkat t - cells ( termed jdap ) [ 37 ] were transfected with a pltr - gag3 - flag - luc reporter plasmid followed by stimulation via anti - cd3 / cd28 ligation for 6 hours .
the pltr - gag3 - flag - luc plasmid contains the hiv - 1 5 ' ltr promoter region with two nf - kappab binding sites and a firefly luciferase open reading frame [ 38 ] .
hiv - 1 transcription was then assessed by a measure of luciferase activity ( figure 2a ) .
anti - cd3 / cd28 stimulation induced a two - fold increase in hiv - 1 transcription in wild type jurkat cells , an effect that was not seen in j14 cells ( figure 2a , upper left panel ) .
re - expression of slp - 76 into j14 cells restored and enhanced hiv - 1 transcription ( blue bars ) .
similarly , anti - cd3 / cd28 induced hiv - 1 transcription was markedly impaired in adap - deficient jdap cells ( figure 2a , upper right panel ) .
furthermore , the overexpression of slp - 76 in jdap cells did not bypass or compensate for the adap deficiency ( figure 2a , lower panel ) .
anti - cd3 / cd28 increased nf - kappab binding by over 3 - fold in wild type jurkat cells as measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) ( the integrated od values from gel - pro image analysis software : 136 to 450 ) , but not in jdap cells ( figure 2b , left panel ) .
in agreement with this , a difference in the degradation of ikappab alpha was observed between wild type and jdap cells ( figure 2b , right panel ) .
ikappab alpha is an inhibitor of nf - kappab which is degraded in response to tcr / cd28 ligation [ 39 ] .
anti - cd3 / cd28 induced a degradation of ikappab alpha in jurkat cells over a period of 90 - 120 min , an effect that was not observed in jdap cells .
instead , jdap cells sustained ikappab alpha expression over the time course .
these observations indicate that adap expression is needed for anti - cd3 / cd28 induced nf - kappab activation .
figure 2 adap and slp - 76 regulates hiv - 1 ltr transcription in a cd28 - and nf - kappab - dependent manner .
( a ) the pltr - gag3 - flag - luc luciferase reporter plasmid was transfected together with gfp or slp - 76 - gfp into jurkat , slp - 76 deficient j14 cells ( upper left panels , p = 0.0112 left ; p = 0.002 right ) or adap deficient jdap cells ( lower left panel , p = 0.0145 ) .
alternatively , this reporter plasmid was transfected into jurkat or jdap cells ( upper right panel , p = 0.0203 ) .
these cells were stimulated with or without anti - cd3 / cd28 to measure hiv - 1 ltr transcription .
( b ) emsa assay and immunoblotting with anti - ikappabalpha showed that the loss of adap markedly decreased anti - cd3 / cd28 - induced nf - kappab activation .
the absolute integrated od values of each band were analyzed by gel - pro ( left panel ) .
( c ) plasmids expressing gfp or adap / gfp or m12 / gfp were transfected together with the luciferase reporter plasmid into jurkat cells to assess the luciferase activity after anti - cd3 / cd28 ( left panel , p < 0.0001 ) or anti - cd3 / cd80 - fc ( right panel , p < 0.05 ) stimulation .
the nf - kappab activation was examined by an emsa assay ( middle panel ) .
( d ) human primary pbls were transfected with gfp or adap / gfp or m12 / gfp together with the luciferase report plasmid to measure hiv - 1 ltr transcription ( p < 0.01 ) .
( e ) cd28 deficient jurkat cells ( upper panel ) or wild type jurkat cells ( lower panel ) were stimulated by anti - cd3 / cd28 with or without anti - lfa - 1 blocking to check hiv - 1 transcription ( p > 0.05 ) .
( f ) jurkat cells expressing gfp or adap / gfp were treated with indicated specific inhibitors , followed by a measurement of the hiv - 1 mrna levels .
( g ) human primary pbls were transfected with gfp or adap / gfp , stimulated by anti - cd3 / cd28 with or without the src kinase inhibitor pp2 to measure hiv - 1 ltr transcription ( ns / not significant ; p = 0.1465 ) .
three independent experiments were performed and the representative data are shown with error bars (* p = < 0.05 , ** p = < 0.01 ) .
we also assessed the effect of adap binding to slp - 76 to regulate hiv - 1 transcription by using cells transfected with wild type adap or the mutant m12 ( figure 2c ) .
adap expression increased anti - cd3 / cd28 induced transcription of the hiv - 1 ltr by 2.5 fold , while this was impaired with m12 ( i.e. 30 - 40 percent less than observed for adap , figure 2c , left panel ) .
adap overexpression also increased hiv - 1 transcription in response to anti - cd3 and cd80 - fc , the natural ligand for cd28 ( figure 2c , right panel ) .
further , an emsa assay showed that adap increased nf - kappab activation ( od values from 11 to 68 ) , and this increase was blocked by m12 ( od values from 16 to 24 ) ( figure 2c , middle panel ) .
as a control , adap could not further enhance the activity of a hiv - luciferase reporter lacking nf - kappab binding sites ( additional file 2 : figure s2a ) .
significantly , the same inhibitory effect of m12 was noted in primary human t - cells that had been co - transfected with pltr - gag3 - flag - luc and ligated with anti - cd3 / cd28 .
adap expression increased hiv transcription by 2.5 - 3 fold , whereas m12 had no effect ( figure 2d ) .
these data indicate that adap and its binding to slp - 76 cooperate with cd28 co - ligation to regulate ltr activity in jurkat and human primary t - cells .
stimulation of t - cells from cd28 deficient jurkat cells further showed a dependency of the nf - kappab - driven hiv - 1 transcriptional response on cd28 ( figure 2e , left panel ) .
anti - lfa - 1 antibody ( i.e. anti - cd18 ) ligation had no ability to activate hiv - 1 transcription alone , or in conjunction with cd3 / cd28 ligation or adap / gfp expression ( right panel ) .
these data indicate that cd28 , but not lfa - 1 costimulation , cooperates with adap in the activation of hiv - 1 transcription .
we next determined whether adap activation of the hiv - 1 ltr intersects with other signaling events .
specific inhibitors of src kinases , phosphotidylinositol 3 kinase ( pi 3 k ) and phospholipase c ( plc ) were used in conjunction with anti - cd3 / cd28 stimulation .
we measured the hiv - 1 gag mrna levels by qrt - pcr ( figure 2f ) or hiv 5 ' ltr transcription activity ( additional file 2 : figure s2b ) .
src kinase inhibitor pp2 and plc inhibitor u73122 significantly decreased anti - cd3 / cd28 induced hiv - 1 transcription in jurkat cells , and reduced the increase observed in adap / gfp expressing cells .
the inhibitory effect of pp2 on hiv - 1 transcription was also observed in primary human t - cells ( figure 2g ) , showing that adap expression increased anti - cd3 / cd28 induced transcription by 2.5 - fold , which was blocked by pp2 treatment .
the pi 3 k inhibitor ly294002 however did not affect transcription ( additional file 2 : figure s2b ) .
we previously showed that this concentration of ly294002 effectively inhibited pi 3 k in jurkat cells by examining protein kinase b ( akt / pkb ) phosphorylation [ 40 ] .
these data indicate that src kinases and plc are needed for adap enhancement of anti - cd3 / cd28 induced hiv - 1 transcription .
lfa - 1 dependency in adap - induced hiv - 1 infection the striking effects of m12 on hiv - 1 replication suggested that additional mechanisms might also be operating. of particular interest was the involvement of adap on the activation of lfa - 1 for adhesion [ 31,34 ] .
to assess the dependency on adap - induced lfa - 1 adhesion during hiv - 1 infection , single - cycle hiv - 1 containing a luciferase reporter was incubated with c8166 cells expressing gfp control , adap / gfp or m12 / gfp .
these cells were either left untreated , or incubated with virus in the absence or presence of soluble icam - 1 - fc or anti - lfa - 1 to block lfa - 1 - mediated adhesion ( figure 3a ) .
hiv - 1 gag mrna levels were assessed using qrt - pcr with specific primers for hiv - 1 gag ( figure 3a , left panel ) .
gag mrna levels were reduced in the control / gfp ( i.e. from 0.7 to 0.3 , p <= 0.05 ) and adap / gfp cells ( i.e. from 1.4 to 0.3 , p <= 0.01 ) in the presence of soluble icam - 1 - fc treatment .
in contrast , the already impaired levels of hiv - 1 gag mrna production in m12 / gfp cells ( i.e. 1.4 vs. 0.35 when compared to adap / gfp cells , p <= 0.01 ) was not further reduced by the presence of icam - 1 - fc. similar to the blocking effect by soluble icam - 1 - fc , anti - lfa - 1 antibody also impaired hiv - 1 gag mrna production ( figure 3a , left panel ) .
we also measured the luciferase reading from the single - cycle luciferase reporter hiv - 1 - infected cells , where soluble icam - 1 - fc or anti - lfa - 1 treatment reduced luciferase readings in the controls and adap / gfp expressing c8166 cells ( figure 3a , right panel ) .
consistently , the decreased luciferase reading in m12 / gfp cells was not further reduced by soluble icam - 1 - fc or anti - lfa - 1 treatment ( figure 3a , right panel ) .
as a control , flow cytometry confirmed that adap and m12 did not alter lfa - 1 expression ( figure 3b ) .
in addition , using higher levels of hiv - 1 particles ( 5 ng p24gag ) , adap expression enhanced the luciferase values relative to the gfp transfected control , while m12 markedly decreased the amount of viruses ) .
consistent results were also observed when these cells were incubated with lower quantities of virus ( 1 ng p24gag ) ( figure 3c ) .
these data indicate that the slp - 76 - adap module regulates hiv - 1 infection in an lfa - 1 - dependent manner .
figure 3 lfa - 1 dependency in adap - induced hiv - 1 infection .
( a ) single - cycle luciferase reporter hiv - 1 was incubated for 2 hrs at 37 degree with c8166 cells that over - expressed gfp control or adap / gfp or m12 / gfp , in the absence or presence of soluble icam - 1 - fc or anti - cd18 treatment .
after washing , these c8166 cells were further cultured for 72 hrs with or without soluble icam - 1 - fc or anti - cd18 .
the amount of hiv - 1 was measured by qrt - pcr using primers specific for the hiv - 1 gag mrna relative to an actin housekeeping gene ( left panel ) or was determined by luciferase assay ( right panel ) .
( b ) overexpression of adap or m12 in c8166 cells did not alter the surface expression levels of lfa - 1 .
( c ) low ( 1 ng p24gag ) or high ( 5 ng p24gag ) amount of single - cycle luciferase reporter hiv - 1 viruses were used to infect c8166 cells over - expressing gfp control or adap / gfp or m12 / gfp .
the luciferase readings were collected from triplicate samples with error bars (* represent p = < 0.05 , ** represents p = < 0.01 , *** represents p = < 0.001 ) .
slp - 76 - adap regulates the vs formation between t - cells and dcs the blockade of adap - induced hiv - 1 infection with soluble icam - 1 - fc suggested that adap might contribute to integrin - mediated viral transmission via affecting the formation of vs and cell - cell conjugation .
lfa - 1 adhesion is known to modulate t - cell conjugation with dendritic cells ( dcs ) or t - cells , even in an antigen independent manner ; and t - cells or dcs expressing hiv - 1 can spread the virus by forming conjugates with non - infected t - cells [ 11 - 16 ] .
we therefore investigated whether adap and slp - 76 could regulate conjugation between dcs and non - infected t cells .
for this , jurkat , jdap and j14 cells were incubated for 1 hour with mature human dcs that were pre - pulsed with hiv - 1 - gag - gfp , followed by the scoring of closely opposed pairs of hiv1 - gag - gfp expressing dcs and t - cells .
examples of hiv - 1 - gag - gfp - pulsed dcs and anti - adap stained t - cells are shown ( figure 4a ) .
hiv - 1 - gag - gfp in dcs and adap in t - cells localized at the contact region between cells .
our previous reports have demonstrated that m12 disrupted its binding with slp - 76 , and reduced lfa - 1 - mediated conjugates formation between antigen presenting cells and t cells [ 31,34 ] .
we asked whether the mutant m12 could impair dc - t conjugation and virological synapse formation .
jurkat t cells stably overexpressing gfp , adap / gfp or m12 / gfp were incubated with mature human dcs that were pre - pulsed with hiv - 1 - gag - gfp ( figure 4b ) .
adap expression enhanced conjugate formation between dc and t cells ( 64 % vs. 47 % compared to vector controls , p <= 0.05 ). by contrast , m12 expression significantly decreased conjugation ( 64 % vs. 38 % , p <= 0.01 ) .
notably , adap also enhanced the formation of vs as defined by the presence of hiv - 1 at the interface ( 65 % vs. 49 % , p <= 0.05 ) , while m12 expression reduced vs formation to 39 % ( p <= 0.01 ) .
in the case of vector and adap transfected cells , lfa - 1 and hiv - 1 co - localized at the interface ( figure 4b , right panels ) .
figure 4 slp - 76 - adap regulates the vs formation between t - cells and hiv - 1 - pulsed dcs .
jurkat , jdap or j14 cells were incubated for 30 min with mature human dcs that were pre - pulsed with hiv1 - gag - gfp vlps .
conjugate formation and the presence of hiv1 - gag - gfp at the vs interface was assessed .
( a ) example of a conjugate shows that anti - adap staining in t - cells and hiv1 - gag - gfp vlps in dcs were peaked at the interface between dc and t cell .
( b ) jurkat cells stably overexpressing gfp , adap / gfp or m12 / gfp were incubated for 30 min with hiv1 - gag - gfp - pulsed human dcs .
represent examples are shown in right panels .
histograms show the percent of conjugate formation ( left panel ; p = 0.0198 left , p = 0.0068 right ) and colocalization of hiv1 - gag - gfp and lfa - 1 at the vs ( right panel ; p = 0.0107 left , p = 0.0022 right ) .
( c ) deficiency of adap ( jdap ) or deficiency of slp - 76 ( j14 ) impaired hiv1 - gag - gfp and lfa - 1 localization at the interface between jurkat cells and dcs .
histograms show the percent of conjugate formation ( upper panel , p = 0.0011 left , p = 0.043 right ) or colocalization of hiv1 - gag - gfp with lfa - 1 at the vs ( lower panel , p = 0.0006 ) .
( d ) human primary cd4 + t cells were transfected with the scramble sirna or sirna adap for 48 hrs , which were then incubated for 30 min with mature human dcs pre - pulsed with hiv1 - gag - gfp vlps .
the conjugate formation ( p = 0.0241 ) and hiv1 - gag - gfp at the vs interface ( p = 0.0018 ) were analyzed and showed in histograms .
typical examples were shown in right panel .
typical examples are shown in right panel (* represents p = < 0.05 , ** represents p = < 0.01 , *** represents p = < 0.001 ) .
further , similar results were seen in comparing conjugation of jurkat relative to jdap cells ( figure 4c ) .
jdap cells formed significantly fewer conjugates than jurkat cells ( i.e. from 37 % to 22 % ; p <= 0.01 ) .
j14 also blocked the conjugate formation with infected dcs to a similar degree ( figure 4c ) .
further , amongst the cells that formed conjugates , hiv - 1 - gag - gfp localization was reduced at the contact region when dcs contacted with jdap cells or j14 cells ( figure 4c ) .
while 46 % of wild - type t - cells showed hiv - 1 - gag - gfp localization at the vs , only 15 % of the jdap or j14 cells showed this feature ( figure 4c ) .
as noted , deficiency of adap in jdap cells ( figure 1b ) or deficiency of slp - 76 in j14 cells ( additional file 3 : figure s3a ) did not affect lfa - 1 expression .
next , we confirmed that knockdown of adap in human primary cd4 + t cells decreased both conjugate formation ( from 41 % to 27 % , p <= 0.05 ) and vs formation ( from 53 % to 31 % , p <= 0.01 ) ( figure 4d ) .
taken together , these data indicate that the loss of adap or slp - 76 or disruption of the binding between slp - 76 and adap impairs conjugation and vs formation between t - cells and dcs .
the slp - 76 - adap module regulates viral transfer between t - cells to assess viral - infected t - cells conjugation with non - infected t - cells , adap or m12 expressing target t cells ( i.e. gfp positive ) were incubated with hiv + donor t cells infected with a cxcr4 - tropic hiv - 1 virus isolate ( pnl43 ) .
conjugates were allowed to form for 1 hour with a human non - inhibitory anti - hiv env monoclonal antibody to stain surface env ( blue ) , while hiv - 1 gag p17 and p24 were intracellular stained ( red ) ( figure 5a ) .
conjugates were scored as apposed pairs consisting of one gfp + target cell and a hiv gag + donor cell .
examples of a conjugate with the gfp labeled t - cell ( panel a ) , env staining ( panel b ) , anti - gag staining ( panel c ) and the merged image ( panel d ) are shown ( figure 5a , left panels ) .
while adap supported the formation of conjugates amongst 65 % of the cells , m12 reduced this to 38 % ( p = 0.02 ) ( figure 5a , middle panel ) .
amongst the remaining cells that formed conjugates , a similar number of adap or m12 expressing cells formed a detectable vs region ( figure 5a , right panel ) .
however , a significant difference was noted in the size of the vs interface formed between viral - infected t cells with adap or m12 expressing target cells ( figure 5b , p = < 0.001 ) .
while adap expressing cells showed an average contact site of 6.4 units , m12 conjugates reduced this to 4.1 units ( figure 5b ) .
in agreement with this , the loss of adap dramatically inhibited anti - cd3 and icam - 1 - induced cell spreading ( additional file 3 : figure s3b ) .
figure 5 the slp - 76 - adap module regulates viral transfer between t - cells .
( a ) adap / gfp and m12 / gfp expressing target cells were mixed with hiv infected donor t cells .

bars are represented as means +/ - sd ( n = 32 ) ( right panel ) .
( c ) m12 reduces hiv - 1 spread amongst t - cells .
quantitative rt - pcr was performed using primers specific for the hiv pol gene and an albumin house - keeping gene .
the ratio of hiv pol dna to albumin was determined as the hiv dna copy number .
the fold increase was calculated relative to the amount of dna at the time point 0 h. data are from three independent experiments and error bars show the sem .
to assess the effect of adap and m12 on hiv - 1 transmission between t cells , we next quantified cell - cell spread using a well - defined qrt - pcr assay in which the copy number of hiv - 1 pol gene was measured and enumerated relative to an albumin housekeeping gene ( figure 5c ) [ 10,13,14 ] .
the fold increase was calculated relative to the number of dna copies at time point 0 hour to account for the presence of integrated proviral dna within the infected donor cell population .
hiv pol copy number corresponds to de novo hiv - 1 dna synthesis .
an increase above 1 reflects reverse transcription as a result of cell - to - cell spread and new infection of the target cells .
while the presence of adap sustained cell - to - cell spread , m12 expression induced a significant reduction in viral transfer between cells ( i.e. 3.5 vs. 2.2 ) .
overall , these data indicate that m12 effectively reduces the number of t - t cell conjugates and the size of the vs , leading to reduced hiv - 1 viral transmission .
discussion although adap acts as an important mediator of t - cell signaling and function [ 29 - 32,34,37,41 ] , its role in hiv - 1 infection of t - cells had yet to be explored .
in this study , we showed that adap was a potent regulator of two central events needed for hiv - 1 infection , namely , the hiv - 1 ltr transcription and viral transfer at the synapses of t - t or dc - t conjugates .
further , the two functions were regulated by two different co - receptors , cd28 in the case of hiv - 1 transcription , and lfa - 1 in the case of cell - cell transmission .
expression of m12 or the down - regulation of adap by sirna effectively suppressed the propagation of hiv - 1 .
our findings therefore identify adap and the slp - 76 / adap signaling module as new potential targets for the repression of hiv - 1 infection .
our studies have demonstrated that adap regulates two distinct events during hiv - 1 infection of t - cells .
while nf - kappab drives the replication of the long terminal repeat ( ltr ) [ 5 ] , the identity of the full range of upstream regulators of nf - kappab - ltr is unknown .
a variety of pro - inflammatory stimuli such as tnf - alpha and il - 1 as well as viral proteins and stress inducers are potent activators [ 42 ] .
in t - cells , protein kinase ctheta ( pkctheta ) and pkcalpha activate nf - kappab following cd3 / cd28 ligation [ 43 - 45 ] .
phorbol ester activation of pkcs can reactivate hiv - 1 in cell lines and importantly , in primary quiescent t cells [ 46,47 ] .
more recently , members of the lat signalosome including adap have been found to be needed for optimal nf - kappab activation [ 41,48 ] .
however , given the different members of the nf - kappab family that can be affected by upstream mediators , it has been unclear whether adap is needed for hiv - 1 ltr transcription .
our findings showed a significant loss of anti - cd3 / cd28 induced hiv - 1 transcripts in jdap cells , indicating that adap is needed for ltr activation .
this in turn was reflected by a lack of detectable ikappabalpha degradation in adap deficient jdap cells .
this regulatory event was linked further upstream to slp - 76 , since a loss of binding to slp - 76 by the m12 mutant impaired ltr activity in jurkat and primary human t - cells .
it is important to note that overexpression of slp - 76 into jdap cells did not rescue the defective hiv - 1 ltr transcription .
this observation suggests that adap is the downstream effector of slp - 76 to regulate hiv - 1 transcription .
overexpression of slp - 76 increased hiv - 1 ltr transcription in wt and slp - 76 deficient j14 jurkat cells .
this effect of slp - 76 on transcription differs from a previous study [ 49 ] .
the basis of this difference is unclear ; however , different results might be caused by different methods used in these studies .
those authors examined the amount of full - length or sliced hiv transcripts by qrt - pcr after j14 or wild type cells were infected with hiv - 1 iiib virus .
we used anti - cd3 / cd28 to activate j14 or wild type cells and the readout was based on the hiv ltr luciferase reporter assay .
the dependency of nf - kappab activation on cd28 expression and its engagement in our studies might explain the differences in results .
in either case , our findings are consistent with a scenario of slp - 76 upstream regulation of adap that in turn is the effector in the regulation of nf - kappab transcription .
further , we observed that the inhibition of src kinase and plcgamma1 activity blocked adap potentiation of hiv - 1 ltr transcription in response to anti - cd3 / cd28 stimulation .
this finding is consistent with the observation that p59fyn can bind and phosphorylate adap , while p56lck is potentially involved in nf - kappab activation [ 50 ] .
consistent with other reports , plcgamma1 activity is required in guanine nucleotide exchange factor vav - 1 induced activation of nf - kappab [ 51 ] .
overall , our data indicate for the first time that adap and slp - 76 are needed for anti - cd3 / cd28 - induced nf - kappab binding to the hiv - 1 ltr and optimal hiv - 1 transcription .
our second major observation was that adap regulated hiv - 1 transmission between dc - t or t - t cells .
evidence has accumulated over the years showing efficient viral spread by direct cell - cell contact [ 52 ] .
in our study , while the blocking of lfa - 1 had no effect on the nf - kappab - driven hiv - 1 ltr transcription , it nevertheless effectively impaired hiv - 1 infection .
this observation underscored the distinct nature of the two steps affected by adap .
jdap cells and human primary cd4 + t cells with reduced adap expression by sirna formed markedly reduced numbers of t - dc conjugates and showed decreased hiv - 1 - gfp vlp localization at the vs interface .
we observed that the m12 mutant also inhibited t - t conjugate formation , while the remaining conjugates showed a reduced size of the interface at vs. both events would be expected to interfere with the optimal viral spread between cells .
finally , in agreement , the de novo hiv dna synthesis as measured by levels of hiv pol in t - cell cultures confirmed a significant reduction in viral spread .
the identity of other signaling mediators other than src kinases and phospholipase c that cooperate with adap to regulate the vs formation and cell - to - cell viral spread remains to be determined .
itk and zap - 70 are needed for viral cell - cell transmission [ 53,54 ] , whereas adap has additional binding sites for vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( vasp ) , a regulator of actin branching [ 55 ] .
lfa - 1 ligation can re - model actin in t - cells [ 31,56,57 ] and t cells require actin polymerization for hiv - 1polarization at the cell - cell contact area .
this in turn is needed for the proper formation of the vs between t - cells , as well as the efficient entry of hiv - 1 into activated cd4 + t cells [ 57 ] .
in agreement , we observed reduced cell spreading in jdap cells , as well as a reduced interface between hiv - 1 infected t cells and non - infected m12 cells .
the inside - out pathway is linked adap with the downstream skap - 1 , which is needed for the rapl - rap1 complex formation and binding of this complex to the cytoplasmic tail of lfa - 1 [ 32,33,35,36,58 ] .
in this context , lfa - 1 also determines the preferential infection of memory cd4 + t cells by hiv - 1 [ 59 ] .
together , adap and the slp - 76 - adap complex represent exciting novel targets for reducing two steps of hiv - 1 infection .
conclusion this study is the first reported demonstration that adap and the slp - 76 / adap signaling module play central roles in two distinct phases of hiv - 1 infection .
firstly , adap cooperated with the co - receptor cd28 and tcr to enhance hiv - 1 ltr transcription via the regulation of nf - kappab .
this regulatory event was dependent on expression of co - receptor cd28 , as well as the activity of src kinases and phospholipase c. phosphoinositol 3 - kinase ( pi 3 k ) and lfa - 1 were not needed for adap regulation of hiv - 1 ltr transcription. by contrast , slp - 76 / adap regulation of viral cell - cell spread was reflected by a reduction in lfa - 1 - dependent dc - t or t - t cell conjugation by the absence of adap or expression of m12 , as well as well as impaired formation of the vs between cells .
overall , our evidence shows that adap and its binding to slp - 76 regulates propagation of hiv - 1 by two distinct coreceptors , and identifies the immune adaptor adap as a new possible target to control hiv - 1 infection .

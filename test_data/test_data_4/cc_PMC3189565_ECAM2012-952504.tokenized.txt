human breast cancers cells overexpressing her2 / neu are more aggressive tumors with poor prognosis , and resistance to chemotherapy .
this study investigates antiproliferation effects of anthraquinone derivatives of rhubarb root on human breast cancer cells. of 7 anthraquinone derivatives , only rhein showed antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on both her2 - overexpressing mcf - 7 ( mcf - 7 / her2 ) and control vector mcf - 7 ( mcf - 7 / vec ) cells .
rhein induced dose - and time - dependent manners increase in caspase - 9 - mediated apoptosis correlating with activation of ros - mediated activation of nf - kappab - and p53 - signaling pathways in both cell types .
therefore , this study highlighted rhein as processing anti - proliferative activity against her2 overexpression or her2 - basal expression in breast cancer cells and playing important roles in apoptotic induction of human breast cancer cells .
1. introduction rhubarb root ( rheum palmatum ) , member of the polygonaceae family , is one well - known antineoplastic herb in traditional chinese medicine [ 1 ] .
anthraquinone derivatives are its main bioactive constituents : emodin ( 1,3,8 - trihydroxy - 6 - methylanthraquinone ) , aloe emodin ( 1,8 - dihydroxy - 3 - hydroxyl - methyl anthraquinone ) , rhein ( 1,8 - dihydroxy - 3 - carboxyanthraquinone ) , chrysophanol ( 1,8 - dihydroxy - 3 - methyl - anthraquinone ) , physcion ( 1,8 - drihydroxy - 3 - methyl - 6 - methoxyanthraquinone ) , and danthron ( 1,8 - dihydroxy - 9,10 - anthraquinone ) .
rhubarb anthraquinone derivatives can induce apoptosis of human cancer , including lung adenocarcinoma a549 , myelogenous leukemia hl - 60 , lung squamous carcinoma ch27 , cervical carcinoma hela cells , neuroblastoma imr - 32 , bladder cancer t24 , and hepatoma hepg2 cells [ 1 ] .
emodin inhibits cellular proliferation , induces apoptosis , and prevents metastasis through activation of tyrosine kinases , phosphoinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) , protein kinase c ( pkc ) , nf - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) , and mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling cascades [ 2 - 5 ] .
aloe - emodin has antitumor properties through the p53 and its downstream p21 pathway [ 6 ] .
emodin and aloe emodin also reduce tumor size , prolong survival , decrease incidence of tumor invasion and neovascularization using in vivo animal models [ 7 , 8 ] .
rhein blocks the uptake of glucose in tumor cells , causing changes in membrane - associated functions to trigger cell death [ 9 ] .
breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women , resulting from gene amplification and / or overexpression of some oncogenes like her2 / neu ( also known as erbb2 ) and oestrogen receptors [ 10 , 11 ] .
overexpression of her2 / neu in nearly 30 % of human breast cancers correlates with more aggressive tumors and poor prognosis [ 12 ] .
her - 2 - overexpressing cells appear to be resistant to some classes of chemotherapy agents [ 12 ] , but sensitive to others [ 13 ] .
overexpression of her2 / neu was positively correlated with p53 nuclear accumulation and tumor metastasis , negatively with hormonal receptor status [ 14 ] .
tyrosine kinase activity of her2 / neu could phosphorylate her3 and then activate phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) involved in malignance of tumors [ 15 ] .
trastuzumab ( herceptin ) is widely used for treatment of her2 - positive breast cancer ; resistance to trastuzumab occurs in some patients [ 16 ] .
therefore , her2 / neu is a potentially therapeutic target for breast cancer , influencing efficacy of chemotherapy .
engineering human breast cancer mcf - 7 cells that expresses basal level of her2 / neu for overexpression of her2 / neu has been used to analyze biological properties of her2 overexpression [ 15 , 17 ] .
this study investigates apoptotic effects of anthraquinone derivatives of rhubarb root on both types of breast cancer cells , her2 - overexpressing mcf - 7 cells ( mcf - 7 / her2 ) and control vector mcf - 7 cells ( mcf - 7 / vec ). of 7 anthraquinone derivatives , only rhein showed antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on both mcf - 7 / her2 and mcf - 7 / vec cells .
we also analyzed apoptotic mechanism of rhein on both human breast cancer cell lines with basal level and overexpression of her2 .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
cell culture human breast cancer cell lines , vector control mcf - 7 cells ( mcf - 7 / vec ) and her2 - overexpressing mcf - 7 cells ( mcf - 7 / her2 ) , were used in this study , as previously described [ 15 ] .
both types were grown in dmem / f - 12 ( invitrogen ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( invitrogen ) , gentamicin ( 50 mg / ml ) and g418 ( 800 mug / ml ) .
2.2 .
western blotting analysis cell lysates that were harvested from mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells with or without treatment of anthraquinone derivatives were dissolved in 2x sds - page sample buffer without 2 - mercaptoethanol , and boiled for 10 min .
cell lysate proteins were resolved on 12 % sds - page gels and transferred to nitrocellulose paper .
resultant blots were blocked with 5 % skim milk and reacted with properly diluted monoclonal antibodies against her2 / c - neu ( ab - 3,3b5 ) , caspase 9 , apoptosis signal - regulating kinase 1 ( ask1 ) , p21 , and beta - actin ( cell signaling technology ) for 3 h incubation .
immune complexes were detected by horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - mouse igg antibodies , followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction ( amersham pharmacia biotech ) .
2.3 .
mtt cytotoxicity test aloe emodin , emodin , rhein , chrysophanol , sennoside a , sennoside b , and 9 - , 10 - anthraquinone were purchased from sigma chemical company ( st. louis , mo , usa ) .
in vitro antiproliferative effect of each compound on mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells was examined using mtt assay .
cells were plated in 96 - well plates ( 5 x 104 cells / well ) and then treated with serial dilution of each tested compound .
after treatment for 48 h , 25 mul of a mtt solution at 5 mg / ml was added to each well and incubated at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 for 3 h. after subsequent washing three times with phosphate buffer saline , 100 mul dmso was added into plates for dissolving formazan crystals .
od570 - 630 in each well was measured with a micro - elisa reader and survival rate used to indicate suppressive effects of each compound on mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells .
survival rate (%) = (( acontrol - aexperiment )/ acontrol ) x 100 % .

3. results and discussion 3.1 .
rhein inhibited growth of mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells in dose - dependent manner to examine expression level of her2 in mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells , both cell lysates were analyzed using western blotting assay .
immunoreactive bands with anti - her2 antibodies revealed basal expression of her2 in mcf - 7 / vec cells and overexpression of her2 in mcf - 7 / her2 cells ( figure 1 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
subsequently , antiproliferative effect of anthraquinone derivatives on mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells was analyzed using mtt assay ( figure 2 ) .
sennosides a and b have no inhibitory effect on cell growth , while ic50 values of 9 - , 10 - anthraquinone , chrysophanol , aloe emodin , and emodin for both types of cells exceeded 100 mug / ml ( table 1 ) .
only rhein had a dose - dependent antiproliferative ability on both types .
in addition , rhein was less toxic to nontumorigenic mcf - 10a cells used as the normal control ( figure 1 of the supplementary material available online at doi : 10.1155 / 2012 / 940920 ) .
the ic50 value of rhein was 36.69 +/ - 9.77 mug / ml ( 129.1 +/ - 34.37 mum ) for mcf - 7 / vec cells and 30.66 +/ - 2.21 mug / ml ( 107.9 +/ - 7.7 mum ) for mcf - 7 / her2 cells .
rhein showed micromolar ic50 values on growth suppression of mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells , similar to antiproliferative activity of rhein lysinate on human breast cancer cell lines mcf - 7 , sk - br - 3 , and mda - mb - 231 [ 18 ] and human hepatocellular carcinoma bel - 7402 cells [ 19 ] , but less potent than its activity against tongue cancer cell line scc - 4 [ 20 ] and ovarian carcinoma cell line skov - 3 [ 21 ] .
3.2 .
rhein influenced cell cycle phase of mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells to examine the effect of rhein on cell cycle phases , both types were treated with or without rhein at concentrations of 10 mug / ml and 100 mug / ml , and then harvested 24 , 48 , and 72 hours posttreatment .
cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed for cell cycle fractions by flow cytometry ( figure 3 ) .
rhein induced concentration - and time - dependent manner increase in sub - g1 ( apoptosis ) fractions of mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells ( p < 0.05 , figure 3 ( a )) .
the rate of g1 phase in mcf - 7 / vec cells significantly increased 24 hours posttreatment with rhein at a concentration of 100 mug / ml ( p < 0.05 ) , but no effect of rhein on g1 phase in mcf - 7 / her2 cells was detected ( figure 3 ( b )) .
rhein at concentrations of 10 and 100 mug / ml caused a significant s phase arrest in mcf - 7 / her2 cells 48 and 72 hours posttreatment ( p < 0.05 ) , but rhein at a concentration of 100 mug / ml decreased s phase fractions in mcf - 7 / vec cells 24 and 48 hours posttreatment ( p < 0.05 , figure 3 ( c )) .
interestingly , a very low fraction of g2 phase was detected in mcf - 7 / her2 cells 48 and 72 hours posttreatment with rhein at a concentration of 100 mug / ml ( p < 0.05 ) ; no significant change appeared in mcf - 7 / vec cells 24 , 48 , and 72 hours posttreatment ( figure 3 ( d )) .
cell cycle analysis demonstrated rhein inducing s phase arrest and g2 phase decrease in mcf - 7 / her2 cells ( figures 3 ( c ) and 3 ( d )) .
moreover , rhein increased the rate of g1 phase , but decreased the fraction of s phase in mcf - 7 / vec cells ( figures 3 ( b ) and 3 ( c )) .
the difference of cell cycle distribution in response to rhein could be due to cell specificity [ 22 , 23 ] .
cell cycle analysis of breast cancer bt - 474 cells and mcf - 7 cells indicated 1alpha ( oh ) d5 inducing an s phase decrease in mcf - 7 cells and a g2 phase decrease in bt - 474 cells [ 22 ] .
moreover , resveratrol induced apoptosis of mcf - 7 cells via s phase arrest , but not mda - mb - 231 cells [ 23 ] .
western blot analysis indicated activation of caspase 9 in both cell types ( figure 4 ) , responsible for dose - dependent manners on rhein - induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells .
results demonstrate that s phase arrest of mcf - 7 / her2 cells and increased g1 phase of mcf - 7 / vec cells correlated with rhein - induced caspase - 9 - mediated apoptosis .
rhein - induced s phase arrest of mcf - 7 / her2 cells correlates with antiproliferative and apoptotic mechanisms of rhein on human hepatocellular and tongue carcinoma cells [ 19 , 24 ] .
also , g1 arrest of mcf - 7 / vec cells induced by rhein proves consistent with rhein - induced apoptosis of human lung cancer a - 549 cells [ 25 ] and cervical cancer ca ski cells [ 26 ] .
3.3 .
rhein induced ros - mediated activation of ask1 in mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells intracellular ros generation reportedly triggers activation of caspase 9 and ask1 signaling in apoptotic responses [ 27 - 29 ] .
therefore , we assessed effects of rhein treatment on intracellular ros and ask1 levels in mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells ( figures 5 and 6 ) .
cells were cultured with rhein at 37degreesc for 48 hours .
after being washing twice with pbs , cells were stained with dcfh - da , then analyzed by flow cytometry .
rhein treatment caused concentration - dependent increase of intracellular ros in mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells ( p < 0.05 , figure 5 ) .
western blot with anti - ask1 antibodies revealed rhein as concentration - dependently triggering ask1 level in each type of cell ( figure 6 ) .
results indicate ros - mediated ask1 signaling in rhein - induced apoptosis of both types .
the findings were in agreement with incremental level of intracellular ros in rhein - induced apoptosis of human tongue cancer cells , promyelocytic leukemia cells , and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells [ 24 , 30 , 31 ] .
3.4 .
rhein activated p53 / p21 signaling in mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells to probe correlation between in vivo signaling pathways and rhein - induced growth arrest and apoptosis , cells in response to rhein were further characterized by dual reporter assays with internal control reporter prluc - c1 and luciferase reporter plasmid containing direct repeat elements of ap1 , nf - kappab , and p53 ( figure 7 ) .
the cells were harvested 4 h posttreatment , and then the relative expression of firefly luciferase driven from the indicated cis - reporter plasmid was normalized by renilla luciferase .
relative intensity of firefly luciferase revealed that rhein significantly activated p53 - and nf - kappab promoters ( p < 0.05 ) , but induced no significant change of ap1 - derived reporter activity in each type of cell ( figure 7 ) .
moreover , p53 - or nf - kappab - derived reporter activity increased more than 1.7 - fold in rhein - treated cells than mock cells .
definite increase of rhein - induced nf - kappab - and p53 - derived reporter activity in both types of cells indicated rhein modulating nf - kappab - and p53 - signaling pathways in breast cancer cells .
our result was inconsistent with the function of nf - kappab mediating the cell survival response by inhibiting p53 - dependent apoptosis and upregulating anti - apoptotic members of the bcl2 family [ 32 ] .
however , recent evidences show pro - apoptotic property of nf - kappab via p53 - dependent apoptosis in breast cancer mcf7 / adr , melanoma m14 , and pro - b cells [ 33 - 36 ] .
activation of nf - kappab induces upregulation of pro - apoptotic death receptor 5 ( dr5 ) in breast cancer mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells , correlating with tnf - related apoptosis inducing ligand - mediated apoptosis [ 37 ] .
in addition , oxidative stress has demonstrated activation of both nf - kappab and p53 [ 38 , 39 ] .
doxycycline - induced superoxide - mediated apoptosis indicated nf - kappab as a proapoptotic factor by activating the p53 - signaling pathway [ 39 ] .
monoamine neurotoxin - induced apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes is associated with activation of nf - kappab , p53 , and c - jun transcription factors [ 40 ] .
thus , rhein - induced activation of both nf - kappab - and p53 - signaling pathways might correlate with ros - mediated ask1 signaling in breast cancer cells ( figures 5 and 6 ) .
moreover , rhein has reported activation of p53 / p21 signaling pathway with in rhein - induced apoptosis of human lung cancer cells , cervical cancer cells , and hepatoblastoma cells [ 25 , 26 , 41 ] .
we also demonstrated rhein - inducing dose - dependent increases of p21 protein in mcf - 7 / vec and mcf - 7 / her2 cells ( figure 8 ) .
therefore , rhein - induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells could be associated with ros - mediated activation of nf - kappab - and p53 - signaling pathways .
in conclusion , this study highlighted rhein versus six other anthraquinone derivatives , as processing antiproliferative activity against both types of breast cancer cells with her2 overexpression or her2 - basal expression .
rhein showed micromolar ic50 values on growth inhibition of both types via caspase - 9 - mediated apoptosis .
ros - mediated activation of nf - kappab - and p53 - signaling pathways might play important roles in rhein - induced apoptosis of human breast cancer cells .

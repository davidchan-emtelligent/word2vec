responses of cells to mechanical stress are thought to be critical in coordinating growth and development .
consistent with this idea , mechanically activated channels play important roles in animal development .
for example , the piezo1 channel controls cell division and epithelial - layer integrity and is necessary for vascular development in mammals .
in plants , the actual contribution of mechanoperception to development remains questionable because very few putative mechanosensors have been identified and the phenotypes of the corresponding mutants are rather mild .
here , we show that the arabidopsis defective kernel 1 ( dek1 ) protein , which is essential for development beyond early embryogenesis , is associated with a mechanically activated ca2 + current in planta , suggesting that perception of mechanical stress plays a critical role in plant development .
a rise in cytoplasmic ca2 + concentration is a well - described response of plant cells to mechanical stimulation .
here the authors show that the dek1 protein , which is essential for epidermis specification and development in plants , is required for triggering a mechanically - activated ca2 + channel .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction multicellular development is dependent upon cell - cell communication .
recent research has highlighted the fact that , in addition to chemical signals , the perception of mechanical stress , at both the cell and tissue level , is a key factor underlying growth coordination and morphogenesis ( e.g. , ref. 1 ) .
however , while in animal systems mechanosensors with important roles in development have been identified2 - 9 , the molecular basis for mechanoperception in plants remains enigmatic .
as in animals , plants respond to mechanical stimuli by an elevation in cytoplasmic ca2 + 10 - 12 .
based on the knowledge of plasma - membrane mechanosensing in animal systems , the most probable trigger for ca2 + release from internal cellular compartments ( ca2 + - induced calcium release ) is either the opening of plasma membrane - localized mechanosensitive ca2 + permeable channels , or the opening of voltage - dependent ca2 + channels in response to changes in membrane potential caused by mechanosensitive channels permeable to other ions12 .
recent research in arabidopsis has led to the identification of several plasma membrane - localized mechanosensitive ion channels .
these include proteins similar to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of small conductance ( the msl family13 - 16 ) , the mca1 protein that rescues the yeast ca2 + channel mutant mid1 , and its homolog mca217 - 20 .
in addition , the membrane protein osca1 forms a hyperosmolarity - gated ca2 + permeable channel required for osmosensing in arabidopsis 21 .
however , although the msl8 protein has recently been shown to be required for pollen grains to survive rapid rehydration during fertilization14 , the very mild developmental phenotypes in single and multiple mutants of genes encoding the channels described above , suggests that they are unlikely to play a major role in mechanosensing during development .
furthermore , these proteins have not conclusively been shown to be responsible for any of the mechanosensitive ca2 + currents which have been detected and extensively described by electrophysiologists over the past few decades in planta 20 , 22 - 26 .
since genes encoding voltage - sensitive ca2 + channels similar to those identified in animal systems have not been found in plant genomes , it has been proposed that plants may have evolved novel systems for mediating mechanosensitive ca2 + fluxes at the plasma membrane to control development ( reviewed in ref. 12 ) .
the defective kernel 1 ( dek1 ) protein is encoded by a highly conserved uni - gene found in all multicellular plant genomes sequenced so far , and it is absolutely required for both embryonic and post - embryonic development in angiosperms27 - 31 .
null dek1 mutant embryos do not develop beyond the early globular stage .
when plants with reduced dek1 activity can be obtained , they show major developmental defects , notably in epidermal differentiation and adhesion30 , 32 , 33 .
the dek1 protein contains multiple predicted transmembrane ( tm ) spans interrupted by a loop , and an intracellular tail including a linker domain and a c - terminal domain showing similarity to animal calpains , a class of ca2 + - dependent cysteine proteases34 .
dek1 localizes to the plasma membrane and to internal compartments32 , 34 .
in their original model of dek1 , lid et al.34 predicted the presence of 21 tm domains with an extracellular localization for the loop and cytoplasmic localization ( subsequently confirmed in planta ) for the c - terminus .
however , in a more recent analysis , kumar et al.35 proposed a consensus model with 23 tm domains and with a cytoplasmic localization for the loop .
structure - function studies have shown that the cytosolic calpain domain of the protein can , alone , complement the embryo lethality of dek1 mutants suggesting that this domain , which is removed from the rest of the protein by an autolytic cleavage event , represents an active form of the dek1 protein32 .
consistent with this scenario , and with a role for dek1 in maintaining epidermal integrity , overexpression of the calpain domain of dek1 leads to thickening of the outer epidermal cell wall in leaves , and increased deposition of pectins36 , which are important for cell adhesion ( reviewed in ref. 37 ) .
the epidermis is thought to be under tension during much of plant growth38 .
one plausible function of dek1 could , therefore , be to perceive and respond to this tension to coordinate epidermal development and maintain epidermal integrity .
as the epidermis plays a critical role in organ growth in plants ( e.g. , refs .
39 - 42 ) , this , in turn , has major implications for plant development as a whole .
the activity of the calpain domain has been shown to be ca2 + - dependent in vitro43 .
these findings are in line with results in animal systems where the activation of cytoplasmic calpains is associated with the ca2 + - dependent autolytic - removal of an n - terminal extension , which in some cases can inhibit calpain activity44 - 46 .
because calpains have been shown to act downstream of mechanosensitive channels such as piezo in animals4 , we tested the hypothesis , and demonstrated , that the tm domain of dek1 is associated with ca2 + dependent mechanoperception at the plasma membrane in plants .
results a rapidly mechanically activated plasma membrane ca2 + channel combining genetic and electrophysiological approaches , the arabidopsis msl9 and msl10 proteins have been shown to mediate a mechanically activated channel activity in protoplasts derived from wild - type plant root cells13 .
selectivity characterization indicated that anions permeate preferentially through the wild - type msl channels13 .
because in this work we used excised membrane patches from callus protoplasts , rather than whole root cell - derived protoplasts , we first investigated whether mechanically activated ion currents due to msls and other unidentified channels could also be detected in this material .
reverse transcription quantitative - pcr ( rt - qpcr ) analysis confirmed the expression of msl9 and msl10 in wild - type ( columbia - 0 ) callus tissue ( supplementary fig. 1a ) .
when cl - is provided at the cytosolic face of plasma membrane patches , a mechanically activated channel with a high conductance ( 46 +/ - 1.4 ps ; +/ - indicates standard deviation , n = 6 ) is elicited upon application of positive pressure using a high - speed pressure clamp , as previously described in root protoplasts ( supplementary fig. 1b ) 13 .
this activity , which is mainly due to msl9 and msl10 , was completely abolished in protoplasts obtained from quintuple msl4 msl5 msl6 msl9 msl10 ( msldelta5 ) mutant callus ( supplementary fig. 1c ) .
in addition , to msl activity , we observed a rapidly activated - inactivated current with a smaller conductance , elicited immediately after the pressure increase ( supplementary fig. 1b ) .
unlike the situation for the msl current , removing cl - from the cytosolic face of the membrane did not modify this rapid current ( fig. 1a , supplementary fig. 1b ) .
the rapid current was still present in protoplasts derived from msldelta5 mutant callus with or without cl - ions at the cytosolic face ( fig. 1a , supplementary fig. 1c ) .
in addition this mechanically activated channel showed a similar conductance to that seen in col - 0 callus ( fig. 1b ) , with a reversal potential at positive voltage ( e revwt = 47.5 +/ - 5.4 mv and e rev mslincrement5 = 60.6 +/ - 11.5 mv ; +/ - indicates standard deviation , n = 6 ) suggesting that this rapid current is most likely mediated by ca2 + influx ( dominant cation gradient , e ca2 += 128.7 mv ) .
consistent with this hypothesis , we found that it could be reversibly eliminated by replacing ca2 + in the bath solution with the larger tea + cation ( fig. 1c , d ) .
the pressure required to activate the current was higher than that required to activate msl channels , suggesting distinct activation thresholds for these channels ( supplementary fig. 1b , c ) .
thus , we can distinguish at least two independent mechanically activated channel activities in callus protoplasts : one dependent on msls activity and the second due to an unidentified ca2 + channel which we called the rapid mechanically activated ( rma ) channel. fig. 1 a mechanically activated current permeable to ca2 + is present at the plasma membrane .
a representative membrane patches from col - 0 ( left ) and an msl quintuple mutant msl4 ; msl5 ; msl6 ; msl9 ; msl10 ( msldelta5 , right ) , exposed to increased positive pressure steps in an outside - out patch configuration show a rapidly activated , rapidly inactivated current in ionic conditions favorable for ca2 + current recording .
we have named the channel responsible for this activity the rma channel ( see text ) .

a paired t - test was used to compare means (** p < 0.01 ) .
values are means +/ - se. for all experiments , the membrane potential was held at - 196 mv. ionic conditions are described in the methods section to understand the nature of the rma - mediated current we tested a range of pipette and bath solutions .
the rma channel conductance is unaffected when ca2 + ions are replaced with ba2 + ions in the bath solution ( fig. 2a , b ) suggesting that the rma channel is similarly permeant to divalent ca2 + and ba2 + ions , as is classically found for ca2 + channels .
to test whether the rma channel shows characteristics previously described for mechanically activated channels in plants , we investigated the effect of gd3 + ions , which are known to affect mechanically activated channel activity in both animal and plant systems23 , 47 - 52 .
rma activity was almost totally blocked by the presence of gd3 + ions , and activity could subsequently be restored by washing out gd3 + ( fig. 2c ) .
the presence of la3 + ions , a known blocker of ca2 + channels53 - 55 strongly reduced the mean open time of the rma channel ( fig. 2d , e ) but did not modify the channel conductance .
we conclude that the rma channel activity fulfils the key criteria previously attributed to mechanically sensitive ca2 + channel activities recorded at the plant plasma membrane. fig. 2 the mechanically activated rma current is preferentially permeable to ca2 + and affected by both the mechanosensitive channel inhibitor gd3 + and the calcium channel blocker la3 + .

for all experiments , the membrane potential was held at - 196 mv. ionic conditions are described in the methods section dek1 trans - membrane domains are required for rma activation loss of dek1 activity in arabidopsis leads to early embryo lethality ( supplementary fig. 2a ) 29 , 30. by expressing the cytoplasmically localized calpain domain under a constitutive promoter ( the rps5a promoter ) in dek1 mutant alleles32 , we could restore post - embryonic growth and thus investigate the contribution of the dek1 tm domain to rma activation .
this was done in both the dek1 - 2 mutant background ( which has a t - dna insertion toward the beginning of the tm encoding regions ( supplementary fig. 2b , c ) 32 ) and in the dek1 - 3 mutant background ( which contains a t - dna downstream of the tm encoding regions of the dek1 gene ( supplementary fig. 2b , c ) 32 ) .
calli were generated from both dek1 - 2 calpain - oe and dek1 - 3 calpain - oe lines and genotyped ( supplementary fig. 3a - c ) .
in callus from calpain complemented dek1 - 3 mutants ( dek1 - 3 calpain - oe ) , we detected wild - type levels of the transcript corresponding to the endogenous tm - span encoding region of dek1 ( supplementary figs. 2c , 4a , b ) .
this allele therefore has the potential to encode a truncated version of the dek1 protein , with an intact set of tm spans .
however , in callus from complemented dek1 - 2 mutants ( dek1 - 2 calpain - oe ) , the tm domain - encoding region of the dek1 gene is physically disrupted ( supplementary figs. 2c , 4a , c ) and an aberrant transcript is produced downstream of the t - dna insertion ( supplementary fig. 4b ) .
this transcript is unlikely to be translated to produce a functional truncated protein as the dek1 - 2 allele shows a null phenotype .
overexpression of the calpain transcript was detected in both backgrounds ( supplementary fig. 4b ) .
we also generated an antibody against the calpain domain and verified overexpression at the protein level ( supplementary figs. 5a , b , 6 ) .
because the dek1 - 2 calpain - oe background cannot produce the intact n - terminal region of dek1 , we next tested the potential effect of dek1 tm domain disruption on the rma channel activity .
in the majority of responsive patches obtained from dek1 - 2 calpain - oe calli we observed a complete absence of the rma current upon membrane stretching ( fig. 3a , supplementary fig. 7 ) .
only a residual current was detectable in most patches of this background .
in patches from dek1 - 3 calpain - oe calli the rma channel activity was still detectable , but showed 6 - 8 times more rapid inactivation kinetics ( fig. 3a , b , supplementary fig. 7 ) compared to those observed in callus from col - 0 plants. fig. 3 rma activation depends on the trans - membrane region of the essential dek1 protein .

for all experiments the membrane potential was held at - 196 mv. ionic conditions are described in the methods section the production of viable dek1 mutant plants , as mentioned before , requires the expression of at least the calpain domain of dek1 .
in our lines , the calpain domain is overexpressed in the callus system at the rna level ( supplementary fig. 4 ) .
to confirm that the loss of the rma channel activity in the dek1 - 2 calpain - oe background is not a consequence of calpain overexpression , we generated calli from col - 0 plants over - expressing the calpain domain ( supplementary figs. 4d and 5 ) 18 .
this material was submitted to electrophysiological analysis .
the rma current was still present in patches from this material , and behaved similarly to the current in col - 0 patches .
( fig. 3a , b , supplementary fig. 7 ) .
therefore , we conclude that the calpain domain overexpression per se is not responsible for the loss of rma channel activity in the dek1 - 2 calpain - oe background .
loss of the dek1 tm domains does not affect msl activity next , we investigated whether the removal of the dek1 tm domains could cause a perturbation of other mechanoresponsive channel activities at the plasma membrane by testing whether msl channels can be activated in the dek1 - 2 calpain - oe line .
we found that the msl activity in dek1 - 2 calpain - oe protoplasts was still detectable upon membrane stretching , and its characteristics were comparable to that of col - 0 ( supplementary fig. 8 ) .
thus , loss of the dek1 tm domains leads to a specific perturbation of the mechanosensitive rma channel activity in our system .
dek1 function influences root growth inhibition by gd3 + ions based on the mild developmental defects observed in the dek1 calpain - oe lines32 , 56 , the calpain domain of dek1 is likely the " active " domain of the protein .
the dek1 calpain domain is autolytically cleaved from the full length dek1 protein32 , and its activity has been shown to be ca2 + dependent in vitro 43 .
because the release of the calpain domain upon dek1 cleavage could be triggered by ca2 + influx via the rma channel , blocking the rma channel might affect development in wild - type plants , but would have a reduced impact in the dek1 - 2 calpain - oe line , where the expression of a " pre - cleaved " version of the dek1 calpain would partially bypass the need for the rma channel activity .
considering the sensitivity of the rma current to gd3 + , and the absence of this current in calpain complemented dek1 - 2 mutants we tested whether calpain complemented dek1 - 2 mutants might show such reduced sensitivity to gd3 + .
gd3 + dramatically inhibits arabidopsis root growth57 .
we generated a dose sensitivity curve of wild - type col - 0 seedlings to concentrations of gd3 + between 0 and 200 mum ( supplementary fig. 9 ) .
we found strong growth inhibition ( 40 - 50 %) in wild - type seedlings even at the lowest concentrations tested ( 30 and 60 mum ) ( supplementary fig. 9 ) .
this inhibition was alleviated in calpain complemented dek1 - 2 plants ( supplementary fig. 10 ) , formally relating dek1 function to gd3 + sensitivity in planta .
reintroducing full - length dek1 restores rma current we hypothesize that the loss of rma current observed in dek1 - 2 calpain - oe callus is caused by the absence of an intact dek1 transmembrane region .
we propose that in the dek1 - 3 calpain - oe plants a truncated dek1 protein , which contains the dek1 transmembrane spans but which cannot confer normal inactivation kinetics on the rma current is produced ( supplementary fig. 2c ) .
to test both these hypotheses we investigated the rma channel activity in both the previously published and characterized dek1 - 3 line complemented with the full length gfp - tagged dek1 protein expressed under the rps5a promoter ( dek1 - 3 dek1 ) 30 , and in a dek1 - 2 mutant background into which the same , complementing full length dek1 - encoding construct had been introduced by crossing ( dek1 - 2 dek1 ) .
in the majority of patches obtained from these lines , we recorded an rma channel activity with inactivation kinetics and current amplitude resembling those of wild - type plants ( fig. 3a , b ; supplementary fig. 7 ) .
the properties of this restored current were tested in the complemented dek1 - 2 dek1 mutant callus and found to be strikingly similar to those of the rma current ( supplementary fig. 11 ) .
our results show that reintroducing the full length dek1 into dek1 mutant backgrounds leads to the restoration of an rma current similar to that observed in wild - type callus .
discussion in summary , we show that the mechanosensitive activity of a ca2 + - permeable channel present in the plasma membrane of arabidopsis callus - derived protoplast requires the tm domains of the dek1 protein .
it has previously been demonstrated that the calpain domain of dek1 is released from the plasma membrane by an autolytic cleavage event32 , and that the calpain activity is enhanced by ca2 + ions43 .
we therefore propose a model in which dek1 activity leads to transient elevation of cytoplasmic ca2 + concentration during mechanical stimulation , which is locally transduced by autolytic cleavage ( and thus activation ) of the calpain domain32 .
based on the phenotype of lines with reduced dek1 activity , this mechanotransduction pathway is likely required for the maintenance of cell - cell contacts and epidermis integrity33 , consistent with embryo lethality in loss of function alleles .
in turn , dek1 - dependent epidermis integrity is required for the propagation of mechanical signals between neighboring cells , in a feedback loop .
given the absolute requirement for dek1 in both coherent embryogenesis and post - embryonic growth29 - 31 , 33 ( summarized in supplementary fig. 12 ) , our work suggests a key contribution of mechanoperception to plant development .
the absence of cell migration in plant tissues may explain why the perception of tension between adjacent cells plays such an essential role in development in this kingdom .
this study , together with previously published results from both our work and the work of others32 , 56 supports the idea that the calpain domain of dek1 is the effector component of the protein in terms of mechanotransduction. whether the transmembrane portion of dek1 forms a mechanically activated ca2 + channel per se , or it is the mechano - sensor associated with an independent ca2 + channel remains to be determined .
however , the published ca2 + dependence of calpain catalytic activity , combined with our electrophysiological results and the fact that calpain complemented dek1 null mutants develop relatively normally , suggests that once activated by cleavage , the calpain domain of dek1 can respond to changes in cytoplasmic ca2 + levels mediated by other ca2 + channels .
these could include proteins such as mca1 and mca2 , or potentially the plant piezo protein , which has yet to be functionally characterized .
the presence of such channels is consistent with our finding that calpain complemented dek1 - 2 plants retain some gd3 + sensitivity in planta .
interestingly , intracellularly localized calpains have been proposed to act downstream of mechanosensitive ion channels in animals , to regulate a variety of cellular processes , including cell - to - cell adhesion58 - 61 .
in this context , the association of a calpain protease with a domain influencing a mechanosensitive ca2 + channel activity in the membranes of multicellular plants may reflect evolutive convergence between these two kingdoms .
in animals , the characterization of mechanosensitive channels piezo1 and piezo2 has revealed novel roles of mechanoperception in development and physiology .
for instance , respiration in lungs relies on piezo2 - expressing sensory neurons , which use mechanical signals to sense airway stretching62 .
axon growth and trajectory was also shown to depend on piezo1 - dependent perception of the mechanical environment of neurons63 .
the association of dek1 , a key developmental regulator , with a mechanosensitive channel activity paves the way to the identification of new roles of mechanical signals in plant development .
methods plant material arabidopsis ( arabidopsis thaliana ) columbia - 0 ( col - 0 ) wild - type seeds were obtained from nottingham arabidopsis stock centre ( nasc , school of biosciences , university of nottingham , united kingdom ) .

one microgram of total rna was reverse transcribed ( rt ) using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
pcr reactions were performed in optical 96 - well plates in the stepone plus real time pcr system ( applied biosystems ) .
five microliters of a 1:10 dilution of cdna was amplified in 20 microl of reaction mix .
the following thermal profile was used : 95 degreesc for 10 min , 40 cycles of 95 degreesc for 15 s , 60 degreesc for 30 s. amplicon melting curves , were recorded after cycle 40 by heating from 60 to 95 degreesc with a ramp speed of 1 degreesc min - 1 .
expression levels of each gene , relative to eif4a , were determined using a modification of the pfaffl method33 .
technical triplicates were performed for each biological sample .
primers used for rt - quantitative ( q ) pcr analysis are shown in supplementary table 1 .
antibody production anti - iiaiib rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against a peptide from the predicted catalytic domain ( rgdkqftdqefppnc ) of the arabidopsis dek1 protein using the polyexpress custom polyclonal antibody production package service ( genscript ) .
western blot analysis callus material for each genotype was snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen , thoroughly ground in pre - cooled porcelain mortars , and proteins were extracted using an extraction buffer containing 50 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 , 150 mm nacl , 1 % nonidet p - 40 , 10 % glycerol , 1 % deoxycholate , 1 mm edta and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail p9599 ( sigma - aldrich ) .
samples were incubated on ice for 1 h , centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000xg at 4 degreesc to remove cell debris , and protein concentrations in supernatants were determined using a bio - rad protein assay ( bio - rad ) .
equal amounts of proteins were loaded and resolved on 7.5 % polyacrylamide / 0.1 % sds gels .
proteins were transferred onto nylon membranes using an iblot ii dry blotting system ( invitrogen ) .
membranes were blocked over night at 4 degreesc using 1x pbs / 0.2 % tween - 20 ( sigma - aldrich ) with 5 % non - fat milk ( regilait ) , incubated for 2 h at room temperature with rabbit polyclonal anti - iiaiib ( genescript ) or mouse monoclonal anti - alpha tubulin clone b - 5 - 1 - 2 ( sigma - aldrich , catalogue number t5168 ) primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:2000 , respectively .
secondary horseradish peroxidase - conjugated anti - rabbit and anti - mouse antibodies ( promega , catalogue numbers s3731 and s3721 , respectively ) were used at a dilution of 1:45,000 .
blots were incubated with super signal west femto reagents ( thermo scientific ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , and then exposed to super rx film ( fujifilm ) .
membranes were first incubated with anti - iiaiib antibodies , and then re - probed with anti - alpha tubulin antibodies .
gadolinium sensitivity experiments seeds were surface - sterilized with chlorine gas , sown on square plates ( in a single row in the upper part of the plates ) , and stratified for 2 days in the dark at 4 degreesc .
after stratification , seeds were germinated in a growth chamber under a 16 - h light / 8 - h dark cycle at 21 degreesc , with plates kept in a vertical position .
plates containing 1 / 5 strength ( 0.86 gr / l ) ms medium ( duchefa ) ph = 5.7 , 1 % sucrose and 0.8 % phytoagar , were supplemented with gadolinium ( iii ) chloride hexahydrate ( sigma - aldrich ) .
primary root length was scored after 5 or 6 days of growth with imagej software .
different genotypes were sown side by side on the same plate and in multiple combinations to buffer possible positional effects .

previous systematic reviews and meta - analyses have evaluated the association of dairy consumption and the risk of cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) .
however , the findings were inconsistent .
no quantitative analysis has specifically assessed the effect of yogurt intake on the incident risk of cvd .
we searched the pubmed and the embase databases from inception to 10 january 2017 .
a generic inverse - variance method was used to pool the fully - adjusted relative risks ( rrs ) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) with a random - effects model .
a generalized least squares trend estimation model was used to calculate the specific slopes in the dose - response analysis .
the present systematic review and meta - analysis identified nine prospective cohort articles involving a total of 291,236 participants .
compared with the lowest category , highest category of yogurt consumption was not significantly related with the incident risk of cvd , and the rr ( 95 % ci ) was 1.01 ( 0.95 , 1.08 ) with an evidence of significant heterogeneity ( i2 = 52 %) .
however , intake of >= 200 g / day yogurt was significantly associated with a lower risk of cvd in the subgroup analysis .
there was a trend that a higher level of yogurt consumption was associated with a lower incident risk of cvd in the dose - response analysis .
a daily dose of >= 200 g yogurt intake might be associated with a lower incident risk of cvd .
further cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are still demanded to establish and confirm the observed association in populations with different characteristics .
yogurt intake stroke coronary heart disease cardiovascular disease meta - analysis 1 .
introduction cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) is still an important public health problem around the world [ 1 ] .
the prevalence of coronary heart disease ( chd ) and stroke has progressively increased during the past decades [ 1,2,3 ] .
given the very large social and economic burden of the treatment of cvd [ 4 ] , identifying modifiable factors is imperative and feasible for preventing the progress of cvd .
several dietary patterns and individual foods have been demonstrated to exert preventive effects on cvd risk [ 5,6,7 ] .
in particular , the benefits of yogurt intake have recently drawn a lot of attention [ 8,9 ] .
yogurt is defined as the product of fermentation of the lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus [ 10 ] .
being an important component of the human diet for several millennia [ 10 ] , it will be a major public health implication if yogurt consumption is demonstrated to have a protective role in delaying the development of cvd .
previous systematic reviews and meta - analyses have evaluated the association of dairy consumption and the risk of cvd [ 11,12,13,14,15 ] .
however , the conclusions were inconsistent .
in the subgroup analysis of yogurt intake , no association was established between yogurt intake and cvd or stroke in three previous meta - analyses [ 11,12,13 ] .
soedamah - muthu et al. did not separately estimate the effect of yogurt intake apart from other dairy products [ 14 ] .
hu et al. observed a protective role of yogurt intake on stroke , but only three studies were included in the pooled analysis [ 15 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , no quantitative analysis has specifically assessed the effect of yogurt intake on the risk of incident cvd .
moreover , whether different amounts of yogurt consumption present different impacts on cvd risk is still uncertain .
therefore , we performed a systematic review and meta - analysis to pool the evidence from prospective cohort studies on the relationship of yogurt intake and the incident risk of cvd .
furthermore , we attempted to evaluate the potential dose - response pattern of the association .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
literature search the present systematic review and meta - analysis was carried out according to a standard process [ 16,17 ] .
we searched the pubmed and the embase databases from inception to 10 january 2017 for records relevant to yogurt consumption and risk of incident cvd .
our search included terms as " fermented dairy " , " yogurt " , " yoghurt " , " sour milk " , " fermented milk " , " cultured milk " , " probiotic " , etc .
language restriction was not set .
a detailed search strategy is presented in supplementary table s1 .
the references of the relevant reviews and original articles were manually searched to find out more potential eligible studies .
when multiple published articles were found from an identical study , the one with the longest follow - up duration was included in the present analysis .
2.2 .
selection criteria and data extraction the authors independently conducted the initial screening process .
after removing the duplicate records , we identified the title and the abstract of each eligible article .
unrelated articles were excluded , and articles of interest were included as further evaluation .
any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two authors .
inclusive criteria : ( 1 ) studies reporting the relationship of yogurt intake and the incident risk of cvd ( chd or stroke ) by using adjusted relative risks ( rrs ) , hazard ratios ( hrs ) , or odds ratios ( ors ) and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) ; ( 2 ) studies in which exposures were the fermented milk , but yogurt was the largest contribution to the total fermented milk ; and ( 3 ) the study design was based on prospective cohort .
exclusive criteria : ( 1 ) the data reported individual components of yogurt , such as protein or probiotics ; ( 2 ) studies that only reported results for total dairy / milk products or combined non - fermented and fermented milk ; ( 3 ) the studies in which the participants are aged < 18 years ; and ( 4 ) the studies in which the participants are pregnant or lactating females .
data extraction was independently implemented by two authors .
data were extracted from each eligible article including the first author , the published year , the study location , the number of cases and total participants , baseline age and gender of participants , the method of exposure and the outcome measurements , the type of exposure and outcome , duration of follow - up , adjusted variables , and the largest number of adjusted ors , rrs , or hrs with their corresponding 95 % cis of incident cvd for all categories of yogurt consumption .
2.3 .
quality assessment the newcastle - ottawa quality scale ( nos ) [ 18 ] was used to estimate the quality assessment of all eligible articles .
higher points indicated higher study quality , and the scale ranged between 0 and 9 points .
three domains were assessed : ( 1 ) the basis of the cohort selection ( 0 - 4 points ) ; ( 2 ) the comparability of the cohort design and analysis ( 0 - 2 points ) ; ( 3 ) and the adequacy of measurements including exposure and outcome variables ( 0 - 3 points ) .
2.4 .
statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted using two sorts of software : stata ( 12.0 , statacorp lp , college station , tx , usa ) and review manager ( 5.2 , the nordic cochrane centre , copenhagen , denmark ) .
we applied rrs to measure the effect size for articles using the incident cases of cvd as an outcome .
an approach of generic inverse - variance was used to pool the outcome data for the yogurt intake of highest vs. lowest category with a random - effects model .
the p - values less than 0.05 were regarded as statistical significant .
heterogeneity across studies was examined by the i2 statistic which , when greater than 50 % , indicated significant results [ 19 ] .
additionally , we conducted a stratified analysis based on pre - specified characteristics including the type of cvd ( chd or stroke ) , study location ( north america or europe ) , age (< 40 or >= 40 years ) , gender ( male , female or both sexes ) , the exposure type ( yogurt or combined with other dairy products ) , and the exposure dose (< 200 or >= 200 g / day ) .
furthermore , meta - regression analysis was used to identify the potential difference of the two groups , p - values of less than 0.1 were judged as significant .
to evaluate the effect of an individual article on the overall pooled results , a sensitivity analysis was conducted by omitting each article from the overall analysis in every turn .
the publication bias was examined through the tests of begg 's and egger 's [ 20,21 ] .
generalized least squares trend ( glst ) estimation model was used to compute the specific slopes in the dose - response analysis [ 22,23 ] .
for categories ( at least three ) of yogurt consumption that were open ( e.g. , 30 - 69 g / day ) , we assigned the median value as the homologous category of yogurt intake .
if the maximum dose was unlimitedly fixed ( e.g. , > 200 g / day ) , we assumed that the mean was 25 % larger than the lower level of the specific category [ 24 ] .
when the number of cases for each category was not available , the rrs were acquired with a general estimate [ 25 ] .
when studies reported yogurt intake in serving / day , we converted the intake to g / day using a standard unit of 244 g [ 26 ] .
the results of the dose - response analysis were shown for each gram increased in daily yogurt intake .
a restricted cubic spline model ( four - knot ) was applied for the assessment of non - linearity hypothesis in the association between yogurt intake and the incident risk of cvd .
3. results 3.1 .
article identification and selection figure 1 presents a flow diagram of articles included in the present study .
in the initial search process , 1348 studies were identified from the pubmed and the embase databases .
after removing the duplicated articles , 1161 studies were included for further assessment .
a total of 1138 studies were excluded after reading the titles and the abstracts .
the remaining 23 studies were evaluated to assess for eligibility after reading the full - text .
finally , nine cohort studies were eligible for inclusion in our meta - analysis [ 27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35 ] .
one of the nine articles was identified from references of a full - text article [ 29 ] .
3.2 .
study characteristics characteristics of each included article are shown in table 1 .
publication years were ranged between 1999 and 2015 .
two articles were conducted in north america [ 27,29 ] and the remaining seven articles were performed in europe [ 28,30,31,32,33,34,35 ] .
follow - up durations ranged between 10.2 [ 31 ] and 17.3 years [ 33 ] .
six articles included both men and women [ 27,28,31,33,34,35 ] , one article included only men [ 30 ] , and two articles included only women [ 29,32 ] .
the baseline age of the participants ranged from >= 21 [ 28 ] to >= 55 years [ 33 ] .
the number of study participants ranged from 1759 [ 27 ] to 85,764 [ 29 ] for a total number of 291,236 .
yogurt intake was assessed by a food - frequency questionnaire ( ffq ) , and the incidences of cvd were ascertained from medical records or registries in all included articles .
3.3 .
quality assessment all studies received a quality score of 8 - 9 stars ( supplementary table s2 ) .
all articles measured yogurt intake by ffq .
the diagnoses of cvd were ascertained from medical records or registries in all included articles .
the follow - up duration of all articles was greater than 10 years .
one article did not exclude participants with a history of chd events [ 27 ] , and one study only included the elderly male smokers ( at a higher risk of cvd ) [ 30 ] .
one article only adjusted for age and smoking status in the statistical model [ 29 ] .
3.4 .
yogurt consumption and the occurrence of cvd figure 2 shows the forest plot of rrs ( 95 % cis ) for the relationship of yogurt consumption ( highest vs. lowest dose ) and the occurrence of cvd by type of outcome .
yogurt consumption was not significantly associated with the developing of cvd in the pooled analysis of 14 comparatives , and the rr ( 95 % ci ) was 1.01 ( 0.95 , 1.08 ) with an evidence of significant heterogeneity ( i2 = 52 %) .
in the stratified analysis by type of outcome , the pooled rrs ( 95 % cis ) of yogurt consumption were 1.04 ( 0.95 , 1.15 ) for chd , 1.02 ( 0.92 , 1.13 ) for stroke , and 0.87 ( 0.77 , 0.98 ) for the incident cvd events .
sensitivity analysis showed that further exclusion of any individual comparative did not significantly alter the pooled rr , and the rrs ( 95 % cis ) ranged between 0.99 ( 0.94 , 1.07 ) and 1.03 ( 0.96 , 1.09 ) .
exclusion the study by larsson et al .
[ 30 ] reduced the heterogeneity to 40 % .
no publication bias was observed among 14 comparatives ( supplementary figure s1 , egger 's test : p - value = 0.228 , begg 's test : p - value = 0.254 ) .
3.5 .
subgroup meta - analysis as shown in table 2 , analyses by study location , age , gender , and the type of exposure did not significantly affect the associations between yogurt intake and the incident risk of cvd ( p - value for difference > 0.1 for each group ) .
stratified analysis by yogurt dose of the highest category (< 200 or >= 200 g / day ) significantly affected the association ( p - value for difference = 0.09 ) , and >= 200 g / day yogurt intake was significantly associated with lower risk of cvd compared with the reference category , and the rr ( 95 % ci ) was 0.92 ( 0.85 , 1.00 ) .
3.6 .
dose - response analysis after excluding three articles [ 27,28,29 ] that reported fewer than three categories of yogurt consumption , the remaining six studies were included in the dose - response analysis .
although the association was not significant , there was a trend that higher level of yogurt consumption was associated with a lower risk of incident cvd events ( figure 3 ) .
4. discussion the present systematic review and meta - analysis identified nine cohort articles involving a total of 291,236 participants .
compared with the lowest category , the highest category of yogurt consumption was not significantly related with the incident risk of cvd ; however , intake of >= 200 g / day yogurt was significantly associated with a lower risk of cvd in the subgroup analysis .
there was a trend that a higher level of yogurt consumption was associated with a lower incident risk of cvd in the dose - response analysis .
an increasing number of epidemiological studies have supported the beneficial effects of yogurt consumption on lowering blood pressure , total cholesterol concentrations , total cholesterol , and plasma glucose [ 9,36,37 ] .
although the findings remain controversial , several epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested the potential role of yogurt intake in weight management [ 38,39 ] .
obesity , hyperlipoidemia , and high blood pressure are well - known risk factors of cvd and , thus , the above studies indirectly support the beneficial role of yogurt consumption on cvd risk .
however , in agreement with several previous meta - analyses [ 11,12,13 ] , we did not observe a significant association between yogurt intake and cvd .
we have obtained a significantly reverse association when only including the highest yogurt consumption of >= 200 g / day , indicating that lower consumption of yogurt (< 200 g / day ) may represent a missed opportunity to contribute to a lower risk of cvd .
yogurt provides a good source of active components , such as calcium , vitamin d , sphingolipids , and probiotics [ 40 ] .
among these , probiotic micro - organisms have an effect on weight reduction , which may translate to a reduced risk of cvd through supporting a healthy gut microbiota composition [ 41 ] .
in addition , some studies revealed that yogurt might interfere with cholesterol synthesis .
however , whether the effects on lipids could be translated to a decreasing risk of cvd is warranted to confirm in the future [ 6 ] .
compared with previously published meta - analyses relevant to this topic [ 11,12,13,14,15 ] , this is the first systematic review and meta - analysis to specifically evaluate the association between yogurt intake and cvd risk .
all included studies were of high - quality , and the follow - up durations were long enough for outcomes to occur .
furthermore , the larger sample size ( 12,262 cases among 291,236 participants ) enabled us to perform stratified and dose - response analyses to explore the potential association .
finally , unlike the study by qin [ 11 ] and de goede et al .
[ 13 ] , only cvd incidence , but not mortality case , was accepted as an outcome .
limitations of our meta - analysis should be mentioned .
first , considerable heterogeneity has been observed across studies .
this is not surprising given the diversity in study characteristics of participants , various doses of yogurt consumption , different type of outcome , and adjusted confounders .
further sensitivity analysis revealed that the study by larsson et al .
[ 30 ] might be the source of heterogeneity .
different from other studies , participants with a higher risk of stroke were included , and three types of stroke were separately reported in the work by larsson et al .
[ 30 ] .
second , detailed data relevant to the patterns of yogurt , such as species of the lactic acid bacteria ( lactobacillus sp. , enterococcus sp. , or streptococcus sp. ) , consuming time and fat - containing ( skim fat , whole - fat , or low - fat yogurt ) were not illustrated in all included studies .
some rcts have indicated that intake of low - fat and whole - fat dairy products may cause different effects on blood pressure , weight and depressive symptoms [ 42,43 ] .
therefore , further studies are needed to resolve this issue .
third , only baseline dietary habits were collected and analyzed in all included studies .
participants may have changed their lifestyle and dietary patterns during the long follow - up period .
fourth , although most studies adjusted for nearly all the important covariates , other potential unmeasured confounders may have influence our findings .
fifth , all studies were conducted in western developed countries , limiting the generalizability of the results to a broader demographic .
considering that the consumption and making methods of yogurt vary greatly from country to country [ 10 ] , region - difference should be considered .
finally , our findings are based on observational studies and , thus , causal association cannot be established .
5. conclusions in conclusion , the present meta - analysis based on nine independent cohort studies provides a non - significant association between yogurt intake and cvd risk .
daily dose of >= 200 g yogurt intake might be associated with a lower risk of cvd .
further cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are still demanded to establish and confirm the observed association in populations with different characteristics .

myofibroblastic sarcoma ( ms ) is a rare disease , which most frequently occurs in the head , neck and extremities .
to the best of our knowledge , although a small number of studies have reported ms of the oral cavity , maxilla , tonsil , thyroid and tongue , ms of the liver and subsequent disabled liver function has not been previously reported .
this study presents the case of a 38 year old female initially diagnosed and treated for a mass in the retroperitoneal region , who was subsequently diagnosed with ms of the liver three months following preliminary surgical treatment .
the patient refused further treatment and was lost to follow - up three months after discharge from the hospital .
clinical , biochemical and imaging observations , as well as pathological manifestations of the patient in the present case are discussed with the aim of increasing the knowledge of ms of the liver .
myofibroblastic sarcoma liver case report introduction myofibroblasts are a type of interstitial spindle cell with the ultrastructural characteristics of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells .
myofibroblasts were first identified electromagnetically by gabbiani et al ( 1 ) in 1971 .
montgomery et al ( 2 ) initially reported myofibroblastic sarcoma ( ms ) in 2001 .
ms originates from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells with the potential to differentiate into fibrocytes and histiocytes .
according to the classification of the world health organization 2002 , myofibrosarcoma was defined as low - grade ms ( lgms ) ( 3 ) .
lgms is a neoplasm of atypical myofibroblasts with fibromatoses like features and a predilection for head and neck sites ( 4 ) .
lgms is rare in clinical practice and can occur at any site .
the head and neck , extremities and femoral bone are the most common sites of origin ( 5 - 8 ) , whereas occurrence in the abdominal cavity is extremely rare and thus , only a small number of cases have been reported in the literature ( 9 - 14 ) .
to the best of our knowledge , no cases of ms of the liver have been reported .
the current study presents the pathological observations , as well as the clinical manifestations , biochemical blood test results and imaging results of a patient with ms in the right posterior liver .
written informed consent for the publication of this study was obtained from the patient .
case report a 38 year old female presented to the clinic of general surgery , department of infectious diseases , the first affiliated hospital of xiamen university ( xiamen , china ) , after experiencing backache for three months previously .
the patient was diagnosed with a retroperitoneal mass following computed tomography ( ct ) and ultrasonic tests ( figs. 1 and 2 ) , which was removed surgically .
postoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( fig. 3 ) and pathology revealed an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor , borderline type , according to the world health organization classification of tumors ( 3 ) .
following surgery , the patient was treated with reduced glutathione ( 300 mg / day ) and phosphatidylcholine ( 200 mg / day ) for a month .
a liver function test one month after surgery revealed total bilirubin ( tbil ) levels of 13.8 mumol / l ( normal range , 0 - 20.5 mumol / l ) , alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) levels of 78 mu / l ( normal range , 0 - 45 u / l ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) levels of 105 mu / l ( normal range , 0 - 35 u / l ) , alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) levels of 458 mu / l ( normal range , 40 - 150 u / l ) , and gamma glutamyltransferase ( ggt ) levels of 225 mu / l ( normal range , 0 - 50 u / l ) .
the patient exhibited no symptoms of fever , jaundice , nausea , loss of appetite , fatigue or diarrhea , however , no significant improvement in liver function was observed when compared with that prior to surgery .
three months following surgery , the patient 's liver function was evaluated , which revealed tbil levels of 16.1 mumol / l , alt levels of 165 mu / l , ast levels of 127 mu / l , ggt levels of 438 mu / l and alp levels of 1426 mu / l. the patient was transferred from surgical clinic to our department ( the department of infectious diseases , the first affiliated hospital of xiamen university ) , and was admitted with a diagnosis of liver damage of unknown origin .
physical examination on admission to our department revealed that the patient showed no mental or intellectual abnormalities , with no jaundice of the skin or sclera and no liver palm or spider angiomas .
lung sounds were clear , with no dry or moist rales .
the patient 's heart rhythm was regular and no murmurs were heard .
the abdomen was flat and soft and a diagonal surgical incision 20 cm in length was identified on the abdomen .
no tenderness or rebound tenderness was identified .
the liver was palpable under the inferior margin of the rib .
however , xiphoid bone and the spleen were not palpable under the left rib .
the patient was negative for murphy syndrome and no shifting dullness of the abdomen or swelling of the lower extremities was identified .
levels of alpha - fetoprotein ( afp ) were < 1.0 ng / ml ( normal range , 0 - 9 ng / ml ) .
levels of afp glycosylation heterogeneity were normal (< 10 %) .
tests for viral markers of hepatitis a , b , c , d and e were negative .
furthermore , antibody profiles of autoimmune liver disease and auto - antibodies were negative : igg , 22.200 g / l ; iga , 3.8200 g / l ; igm , 2.4200 g / l ; and igg2 , 11.0 g / l. color ultrasound of the upper abdomen showed diffuse disease of the hepatic parenchyma ( fig. 4 ) .
plain and enhanced ct scans of the liver revealed a marginal reduction in volume and cavernous hemangioma in the right posterior liver ( fig. 5 ) .
liver biopsy was performed to clarify the nature of the lesion ( fig. 6 ) .
pathological observation revealed widespread infiltration of spindle - shaped cells , with abundant and eosinophilic cytoplasm , unclear cell borders and low and moderate range atypia of the nuclei .
a small number of lymphocytes and eosinophilic granulocytes were also observed in the liver tissue .
in the surrounding liver tissue lesions , the dividing lines of liver lobules were clear , and edema and spotted and focal necrosis was present in a small number of liver cells .
the portal area had marginally expanded and the infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophilic granulocytes was identified .
immunohistochemical analysis revealed positivity for smooth muscle actin , cd99 , bcl - 2 , p53 , calponin and vimentin and negativity for cytokeratin ( ck ) , ck8 , glypican - 3 , hep , myoglobin , myosin , desmin , s100 , hmb45 , cd117 , cd34 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase .
masson + reticular fiber staining revealed a mesh stent in the hepatic lobule , with a clear structure and slight hyperplasia of fibrous tissue in the portal area .
pathological diagnosis indicated infiltration of low grade ms in the liver .
after diagnosis was confirmed , the patient was transferred to the department of surgical oncology , the first affiliated hospital of xiamen university for further treatment .
the patient refused further treatment and was lost to follow - up three months after discharge from the hospital .
discussion myofibroblasts are a type of interstitial spindle cell with the ultrastructural characteristics of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells .
they occur in a number of normal tissues and certain benign lesions , including infection and granulation tissue ( 15 ) .
in the current case , the pathology of the retroperitoneal mass indicated inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor ( imt ) , which is a tumor of intermediate type .
no recurrence of the retroperitoneal mass was identified in the follow - up. furthermore , no tumors were detected in the intra - abdominal organs , and the retroperitoneal imt was a different type of tumor to lgms .
the patient initially presented with abnormal liver function , which was characterized by a marginal increase in alt and ast levels and a significant increase in alp , ggt and alp levels .
in this case report , the female patient exhibited no evidence of viral hepatitis or liver disease induced by alcohol or drugs .
a significant increase in alp and ggt levels may lead to misdiagnosis of autoimmune liver disease .
liver iconography of the patient in the present report revealed no definite signs of space occupying lesions .
infiltration of tumor cells is easily detectable in routine liver biopsy , which may reveal widespread infiltration of tumor cells in the whole liver .
however , at present , there are few reports of this type of liver lesion in the literature .
further studies are required to investigate the bionomics of lgms due to its rarity in clinical practice .
it remains unclear whether the abnormality of liver function was caused by the tumor cells directly or by hepatic tissue destroyed by tumor cells .
therefore , the association between imt and lgms and tumorigenicity requires further study ( 16 ) .

serine - proteases are important players in the pathogenesis of asthma , promoting inflammation and tissue remodeling .
it 's also known that many serine protease inhibitors display immunomodulatory properties .
tgpi - 1 is a toxoplasma gondii protein that exhibits broad spectrum inhibitory activity against serine proteases .
in view of the increased prevalence of atopic disorders and the need to develop new treatment strategies we sought to investigate the potential of tgpi - 1 for treating respiratory allergies .
for this purpose , we developed a therapeutic experimental model .
balb / c mice were rendered allergic by intraperitoneal ovalbumin - alum sensitization and airway - challenged .
once the asthmatic phenotype was achieved , mice were intranasally treated with rtgpi - 1 alone or with a mixture of rtgpi - 1 and ovalbumin ( ova ) .
a week later mice were given a secondary aerosol challenge .
treatment with rtgpi - 1 alone or co - administered with ova diminished bronchoalveolar eosinophilia , mucus production and peribronchial lung infiltration .
this effect was accompanied by a lung resistance reduction of 26.3 % and 50.3 % respectively .
both treatments resulted in the production of lower levels of il - 4 , il - 5 , ifn - gamma and regulatory il - 10 by thoracic lymph node cells stimulated with ova .
interestingly , significant decreases in ova specific ige and t cell proliferation , and increases in foxp3 + t cells at local and systemic levels were only detected when the inhibitor was administered along with ova .
these results show that both rtgpi - 1 treatments reduced asthma hallmarks .
however , co - administration of the inhibitor with the allergen was more effective .
hence , rtgpi - 1 emerges as a novel adjuvant candidate for asthma treatment .

introduction asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by infiltration of the pulmonary mucosa with eosinophils , macrophages and t cells , goblet cell metaplasia and epithelial hypertrophy / hyperplasia .
this inflammatory condition orchestrated by th2 - type cytokines leads to airway obstruction with an exacerbated response to different stimuli ( ahr ) , and bronchial architecture remodeling with subepithelial fibrosis [ 1 ] .
present therapies for treatment of allergic conditions depend on antihistamines and anti - inflammatory agents ; however , the long term use of these drugs may lead to the appearance of side effects and the generation of resistance [ 2 - 4 ] .
therefore , immunotherapy is currently an alternative treatment to antihistamines , bronchodilators and corticosteroids .
it is well known that allergy may be down modulated by certain infections [ 5 ] .
the knowledge of the mechanisms participating in this process offered novel therapeutic approaches for allergic diseases by using immunomodulatory microbe 's components [ 6,7 ] .
in this context , we [ 8 ] and others [ 9 ] have previously shown that toxoplasma gondii infection decreases the subsequent development of allergic lung inflammation .
these results led us to search for parasite proteins with immunomodulatory properties that could be used for allergy treatments .
the t. gondii protease inhibitor - 1 ( tgpi - 1 ) is a four domain protein that belongs to kazal - type serine protease inhibitors [ 10,11 ] .
biochemical studies with a recombinant form of this protein have shown its ability to inhibit a broad range of serine - proteases , including trypsin , chymotrypsin , neutrophil elastase [ 12 ] and subtilisin [ 13 ] .
it has been reported that many serine protease inhibitors such as the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor ( slpi ) and the serum protease inhibitor alpha1 - antitrypsin ( haat ) possess immunomodulatory properties .
these properties include the inhibition of inflammatory responses by preventing the activation of nuclear factor kappab ( nf - kappab ) [ 14 ] or by up - regulating il - 10 and tgf - beta production by macrophages [ 15 ] ; the development of antigen - specific t regulatory cells [ 16,17 ] and the reduction of b - lymphocyte responses [ 18 ] .
in addition , it is known that both endogenous and exogenous proteases play significant roles in asthma pathophysiology [ 19 - 21 ] .
mast cell serine proteases [ 22 ] , matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( mmp - 9 ) and neutrophil elastase [ 23 ] showed to be present in elevated levels in the airways of asthmatic patients suggesting an imbalance in the protease / anti - protease system .
in this regard , it has been demonstrated that neutrophil elastase promotes bronchoconstriction [ 24 ] and stimulates the secretion of mucin5ac from airway epithelial cells [ 25 ] .
also , it has been shown that trypsin can activate human eosinophils [ 26 ] .
therefore , targeting proteolytic activity with inhibitors could lead to a reduction of proteases induced inflammatory diseases .
moreover , the immunomodulating ability of serine proteases inhibitors makes these proteins interesting to be studied as candidates for asthma immunotherapy .
in this regard , and so far , the effect of serine protease inhibitors on allergic inflammation have mostly been studied in monotherapy protocols by treating the animals without allergen [ 27 - 30 ]. with this background and facing the need to find new molecules for the treatment of allergies , we analyzed the potential of the serine protease inhibitor - 1 from t. gondii for treating respiratory allergies .
for this purpose , we studied its efficacy either administered alone or in combination with the allergen .
we found that both treatments with rtgpi - 1 ameliorate the disease manifestations .
moreover , administration of the serine - protease inhibitor concomitantly with the allergen resulted in decreased allergen - specific t cell proliferation and expansion of foxp3 + tregs .
materials and methods animals balb / c ( h - 2d ) mice were obtained from the animal facilities of the school of veterinary sciences , university of buenos aires , argentina , and maintained in our animal facilities for use throughout these experiments .
mice were used at the age of 6 to 8 weeks .
all procedures requiring animals were approved by the independent ethics committee for the care and use of experimental animals of national university of san martin ( cicuae protocol id # 005 / 16 ) .
expression and purification of the recombinant protein the recombinant tgpi - 1 protein ( rtgpi - 1 ) was previously generated by pszenny et al .
[ 10 ] .
the rtgpi - 1 coding region of the mature protein ( from residue 25 to the end , residue 294 ) was cloned into the bamhi and kpni restriction sites of the pqe30 expression vector , which produces a recombinant protein with a 6x - his tag at the n - terminus ( rtgpi - 1 ) .
the recombinant protein includes the four kazal - type domains .
escherichia coli m15 transformed with plasmid pqe30 - tgpi - 1 was kindly provided by dr. angel ( iib - intech , unsam ) .
for expression , as previously described [ 10,31,32 ] , a single colony was grown overnight at 37degreesc in luria - bertani broth supplemented with ampicillin ( 100 mug / ml ) and kanamycin ( 50 mug / ml ) , diluted ten times and grown at 37degreesc until od600nm = 0.4 .
rtgpi - 1 expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl - beta - d - thiogalactopyranoside at final concentration of 1 mm. after 3 h of growth , cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer ( 8m urea ; 20 mm nah2po4 ; 300 mm nacl ; 10 mm imidazole ; ph 7.4 - 7.6 ) .
cells were lysed on ice by sonication and centrifuged at 10,000xg at 4degreesc for 20 min to prepare a supernatant .
the supernatant was loaded onto the ni + 2 - nitriloacetic acid resin affinity column ( ge healthcare life sciences ) , previously equilibrated with lysis buffer .
the column was then washed with 10 volumes of wash buffer ( 20 mm nah2po4 ; 0.5 m nacl ; 20 mm imidazole ; ph 7.4 ) and eluted with elution buffer ( 20 mm nah2po4 ; 0.5m nacl ; 250 mm imidazole ; ph 7.4 ) .
the purified recombinant protein was quantitated by bradford 's method .
before mouse treatment , rtgpi - 1 was dialyzed against pbs and endotoxins were removed with detoxi - gel ( tm ) endotoxin removing columns ( thermo fisher scientific , pierce biotechnology ) , filtered throughout a 0.22 mum - pore membrane and stored at - 80degreesc .
western blot analysis for western blot analysis , purified protein was incubated at 100degreesc for 5 min in loading buffer , separated by sds - page ( 12 % gel ) and transferred onto pvdf membrane ( ge ) using an electro - transfer unit ( bio - rad ) .
the membranes were sequentially incubated with mouse polyclonal anti - rtgpi - 1 antibody ( 1:1000 ) or anti - histidine ( 1:3000 ; sigma ) and alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti - mouse igg ( 1:5000 ; sigma ) .
after washing , the reaction was developed by the addition of nitroblue tetrazolium / 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl phosphate ( nbt / bcip ) substrate .
pagerulertm prestained protein ladder ( thermo scientific ) was used as molecular marker .
trypsin - inhibitory activity trypsin - inhibitory activity of rtgpi - 1 was checked before mouse treatment by 12.5 % sds - page in 0.15 % gelatin containing gels , without prior reduction and boiling , a technique commonly used for detection of proteolytic activity [ 10 ] .
porcine trypsin ( 50 ng ) ( sigma - aldrich ) was incubated with or without 1 mug of rtgpi - 1 in the activity buffer ( 25 mm tris hcl , ph 7.2 , 50 mm nacl ) at 37degreesc for 15 min and then subjected to electrophoresis .
the gel was washed twice with 0.1 % triton x - 100 , 20 min each , incubated at 37degreesc in the activity buffer overnight and stained with coomassie brilliant blue r - 250 .
the gelatinase activity was visualized as white bands on a blue background , which represented areas of proteolysis .
experimental protocol sensitization was achieved by two intraperitoneal injections of 0.2 ml pbs containing chicken egg white albumin ( ova ) ( grade v sigma - aldrich ) ( 20 mug ) and alum ( 2 mg ) one week apart .
one week later , mice were exposed to aerosols of allergen ( 3 % ( w / v )) ova in pbs for 20 min on 3 consecutive days .
aerosol exposure was performed within individual compartments of a mouse pie chamber using a nebulizer ( san - up , argentina , ova solution flux 0.33 ml / min in air flux of 6 - 8 l / min ) .
forty eight hours after the last exposure , mice were intranasally treated with 50 mug of rtgpi - 1 ( pi ) or a mixture of rtgpi - 1 ( 50 mug ) plus ova ( 20 mug ) ( opi ) in a final volume of 35 mul .
controls included non - sensitized mice treated with rtgpi - 1 alone ( n ) , and sensitized mice exposed intranasally to pbs ( o ) ( positive control of pi group ) or ova ( oo ) ( positive control of opi group ) .
one week later , mice were re - challenged by exposing them to aerosols of ova during 3 consecutive days .
analysis was performed 48 h after the last exposure .
the experimental protocol is summarized in fig 1 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0187002.g001 fig 1 schematic of asthma model and treatment protocol .
mice were sensitized by two injections of ova / alum and challenged by exposure to aerosols of allergen on 3 consecutive days .
two days later mice were intranasally ( in ) treated with rtgpi - 1 ( pi ) or rtgpi - 1 plus ova ( opi ) .
controls included non - sensitized mice treated with rtgpi - 1 alone ( n ) , and sensitized mice exposed intranasally to pbs ( o ) or ova ( oo ) .
one week later , mice were re - challenged and analysis was performed 48 h after the last exposure .
pathologic analysis animals were euthanized with isoflurane .
the chest wall was opened and the animals were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture .
serum was prepared and stored at - 20degreesc .
the trachea was cannulated after blood collection .
bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) was performed four times with 1 ml of sterile pbs .
lavage fluid was collected , centrifuged at 300xg for 10 min , and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml pbs .
bal differential cell counts were performed on cytocentrifuge slides prepared by centrifugation of samples at 300xg for 5 min ( td4 - ws , pingfan instrument and meter co , ltd. ) .
these slides were fixed and stained with a modified wright - giemsa stain ( tincion 15 , biopur srl , rosario , argentina ) , and a total of 200 cells were counted for each sample by optical microscopy .
for histopathology , lungs were removed and fixed with formalin .
following paraffin embedding , tissue sections for microscopy were stained with h & e and periodic acid - schiff ( pas ) .
an index of pathologic changes in h & e slides was obtained by scoring the inflammatory infiltrates around the airways and vessels for greatest severity ( 0 , normal ; 1 , <= 3 cells diameter thick ; 2 , 4 - 10 cells diameter thick ; 3 , > 10 cells diameter thick ) and overall extent ( 0 , normal , 0.5 , < 5 % of sample , 1 , < 25 % , 2 , 25 - 50 % , 3 , 51 - 75 % , 4 , > 75 %) .
the index was calculated by multiplying severity by extent .
an histological goblet cell score was obtained in pas - stained lung sections by examining 20 consecutive airways from all groups of mice at 400x magnification and categorized according to the abundance of pas - positive goblet ( 0 , < 5 % goblet cells ; 1 , 5 - 25 % ; 2 , 26 - 50 % ; 3 , 51 - 75 % ; 4 , > 75 %) .
the index was calculated by dividing the sum of the airway scores from each lung by the number of airways examined for the histological goblet cell score [ 33 ] .
lung function twenty four hours after the last challenge mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine / xylazine .
six mice per group were tracheostomized and intubated to a small animal ventilator ( finepointe series rc sites , buxco research system , wilmington , de , usa ) .
then , the dynamic airway pressure was measured for 3 min and the maximal resistance measurement was obtained both before and after increased doses of aerosolized methacholine ( 0.0 - 30 mg / ml ) .
ex vivo cytokine production and proliferation assays single cell suspensions from thoracic lymph nodes ( tln ) and spleen were made using a cell strainer and 3x105 cells were cultured in 200 mul of medium rpmi 1640 supplemented with 20 % fbs ( natocor , cordoba , argentina ) , 1 % antibiotics and 5x10 - 5 m 2 - mercaptoethanol alone or in the presence of ova ( grade v ; sigma - aldrich ) ( 200 mug / ml for tln or 500 mug / ml for splenocyte proliferation ) .
cytokine production was measured in supernatants at 72 h by capture elisa commercial kits ( bd biosciences ) .
proliferative responses were determined after addition of methyl - 3 [ h ] - thymidine ( 1 muci / well , perkinelmer , argentina ) for the last 18 h of a 5 days culture period .
proliferation is shown as the difference in incorporation of [ 3h ] - thymidine between stimulated and non - stimulated cells ( delta cpm ) .
assay of serum immunoglobulin elisa plates ( nunc maxisorp , boston , ma , usa ) were coated with ova ( 10 mug / ml ) in carbonate buffer ( ph = 9.5 ) and placed at 4degreesc overnight .
mouse sera were diluted 1:40 ( ige ) , 1:64x106 ( igg1 ) and 1:16x103 ( igg2a ) .
biotinylated anti - ige mouse antibody ( bd , biosciences ) or hrp - conjugated goat anti - mouse igg1 or igg2b ( bd , biosciences ) were used as a secondary antibodies .
for ige determination , streptavidin coupled to peroxidase enzyme ( hrp , horseradish peroxidase - streptavidin , zymed , 1 / 4000 ) was added .
immune complexes were revealed with trimethylbenzidine substrate ( tmb one - step ; dako , carpenteria , ca , usa ) .
plates were read in a plate reader ( sunrise rc , tecan ) at 450 nm with lambda correction at 570 nm after the addition of stop solution ( h2so4 ) .
results are shown as optical density ( od ) for a fixed dilution .
flow cytometry analysis intracellular staining of foxp3 was performed using phycoerythrin - conjugated anti - foxp3 mab and the foxp3 staining buffer set ( pharmingen , bd biosciences ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
percp - cy5.5 - conjugated anti - cd4 mab ( clone rm4 - 5 ) from pharmingen , bd was used .
cells were acquired on a facscan cytometer ( becton dickinson , mountain view , ca ) .
data were analyzed by using flowjo software ( tree star , ca , usa ) statistical analysis each experimental group had at least four mice and each experiment was repeated at least 3 times .
data are presented as mean +/ - sem .
statistical analysis was performed using anova analysis of differences among groups with bonferroni 's test " a posteriori " as indicated in the figure legends .
statistical significance was accepted when p < 0.05 .
results purification and activity of rtgpi - 1 the purified rtgpi - 1 protein migrated as a unique band with an apparent molecular weight of ~ 42 kda ( fig 2a ) , which was recognized by a mouse polyclonal antibody against rtgpi - 1 ( fig 2b ) .
to confirm the activity of the purified rtgpi - 1 , the ability to inhibit trypsin was analyzed by sds - page zymography .
fig 2c shows that trypsin generated a band indicating protease activity ( lane 2 ) .
after incubation in the presence of rtgpi - 1 the gelatinolytic activity was completely abolished ( lane 1 ) .

intranasal administration of rtgpi - 1 suppresses allergen - induced airway inflammation the effects of intranasal administration of rtgpi - 1 were examined in a murine model of asthma .
balb / c mice were sensitized with two intraperitoneal inoculations of ova / alum and airway challenged with ova .
after 48 hours , allergic mice were intranasally treated for 3 days with rtgpi - 1 alone ( pi ) or in combination with ova ( opi ) .
positive controls included allergic mice intranasally treated with the allergen ( oo ) ( positive control of opi ) or pbs ( o ) ( positive control of pi ) , and the negative control included naive mice treated with rtgpi - 1 ( n ) .
a week later , animals were re - challenged with the allergen and the asthma phenotype was evaluated ( fig 1 ) .
consistent with an allergic inflammation , allergic mice intranasally exposed or not to the allergen ( oo and o groups ) presented a significant increase in bal eosinophilia as compared with n mice ( p < 0.01 ) ( fig 3a ) .
animals treated with rtgpi - 1 alone ( pi group ) presented a tendency to reduced numbers of this population .
on the other hand , treatment with rtgpi - 1 along with ova ( opi group ) resulted in a significant decrease in bal eosinophils ( fig 3a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0187002.g003 fig 3 rtgpi - 1 treatment ameliorates lung histopathology .
( a ) bal eosinophil count was performed on cytocentrifuge slides stained with a modified wright - giemsa stain .
( b ) sections for microscopy were stained with haematoxylin and pas .
original magnification 100x .
( c ) a histological goblet cell score was obtained in periodic acid - schiff ( pas ) - stained lung sections by examining 20 consecutive airways at 400x magnification .
( d ) an index of pathologic changes in h & e slides was obtained by scoring the inflammatory infiltrate around the airways and vessels for greatest severity and overall extent .
results for each group are expressed as the mean +/ - sem. * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 , alpha p < 0.01 vs n , ns : non - significant ; anova with bonferroni 's test a posteriori .
the h & e and pas lung - stained sections were analyzed to evaluate whether diminished bal eosinophilia correlated with reduced lung pathology ( fig 3b ) .
both groups of sensitized and subsequent airway challenged mice ( oo and o ) showed typical pathologic features of pulmonary allergic inflammation compared with naive mice ( n ) .
these features include cell infiltration around airways and vessels , and mainly goblet cell metaplasia .
both groups treated with rtgpi - 1 showed a decreased inflammatory infiltrate and goblet cell metaplasia ( fig 3b ) .
however , the results of semiquantitative scoring of histology show that treatment with rtgpi - 1 alone significantly decreased only mucus index while rtgpi - 1 plus ova diminished both parameters , mucus and infiltrate .
moreover , the improvement obtained with rtgpi - 1 plus ova was also observed when compared with asthmatic mice exposed to pbs ( o control group ) , showing that this co - treatment was more effective than rtgpi - 1 alone ( fig 3c and 3d ) .
effects of rtgpi - 1 treatment on ova - specific serum antibodies forty eight hours after the last ova challenge , serum samples were obtained to analyze whether rtgpi - 1 treatment could modulate ova - specific immunoglobulin levels .
as expected , ige antibodies were increased in both groups of allergic mice ( o and oo ) compared to naive group .
intranasal rtgpi - 1 administration concomitantly with allergen ( opi ) significantly reduced ova - specific ige levels by nearly 56 % .
in addition , when compared to asthmatic mice exposed to pbs ( o control group ) this reduction reached 65 % ( fig 4 ) .
although not statistically significant , animals treated with rtgpi - 1 alone showed a trend to diminished ige antibodies .
serum concentration of neither igg1 nor igg2a isotypes showed significant changes ( fig 4 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0187002.g004 fig 4 effect of rtgp - 1 treatment on allergen - specific humoral response .
serum levels of ova - specific ige ( dilution , 1:40 ) , igg1 ( dilution , 1:64x106 ) and igg2a ( dilution , 1:16x103 ) antibodies were quantified in all experimental groups .
results are expressed as the mean +/ - sem .
* p < 0.05 , alpha p < 0.05 vs n , ns : non - significant ; anova with bonferroni 's test a posteriori .
we also considered important to evaluate whether as a consequence of the protocol treatment , a rtgpi - 1 specific humoral response was induced .
interestingly , no specific antibodies against this protein were detected ( s1 fig ) .
moreover , intranasal immunization with rtgpi - 1 with cpg - odn in a vaccination protocol against t. gondii infection did not induce the production of rtgpi - 1 specific antibodies ([ 32 ] and s1 fig ) .
rtgpi - 1 treatment ameliorates ova - specific airway resistance in allergic mice the airway hyperresponsiveness ( ahr ) is a hallmark of bronchial asthma and determinant to make a positive diagnosis in patients .
to study whether in addition to reducing lung inflammation , the rtgpi - 1 treatments are able to improve lung function , 24 h after the last allergen challenge all groups of mice were subjected to methacholine stimulation testing .
compared to the naive group both o and oo groups showed increased airway resistance .
mice treated with rtgpi - 1 either alone ( pi ) or co - administered with ova ( opi ) showed significantly reduced airway resistance compared to allergic mice ( fig 5 ) .
however and interestingly , the reduction was more remarkable with the rtgpi - 1 - ova mixture than when mice were treated with rtgpi - 1 without the allergen since a significant reduction of airway resistance was obtained at lower doses of methacholine ( 10 mg / ml ) ( fig 5 ) .
improvement in lung function was also analyzed by comparing the ratio between values obtained at the methacholine higher dose from the positive control group and its corresponding experimental group .
this analysis showed an improvement of 53 % ( opi ) vs 26.3 % ( pi ) .
furthermore , even when compared to o group , co - treatment reduced airway resistance by 38 % .
these results not only indicate that intranasal administration of rtgpi - 1 significantly ameliorated airway hyperresponsivenes in allergic mice , but also that co - administration of rtgpi - 1 plus allergen resulted more effective than treatment with rtgpi - 1 alone .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0187002.g005 fig 5 rtgpi - 1 treatment attenuates airway hyperresponsiveness .
changes in pulmonary resistance in response to increasing doses of methacholine ( 0 - 30 mg / ml ) were evaluated by invasive plethysmography .

effects of rtgpi - 1 treatment on cytokine production we subsequently examined the effect of rtgpi - 1 treatment on cytokine production by thoracic lymph node ( tln ) cells in vitro stimulated with ova .
the levels of il - 4 , il - 5 and , to a lesser extent ifn - gamma , were increased in sensitized and challenged mice intranasally exposed to pbs ( o ) or ova ( oo ) compared to non - sensitized mice ( n ) .
treatment with rtgpi - 1 significantly decreased the levels of both th2 ( il - 4 , il - 5 ) and th1 ( ifn - gamma ) type cytokines compared to the allergic groups ( fig 6 ) .
also , while high levels of regulatory il - 10 were detected in supernatants from ova - stimulated cells from allergic mice , a marked reduction was observed in both groups of animals treated with rtgpi - 1 .
no significant differences were detected in allergen specific tgf - beta production between groups ( fig 6 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0187002.g006 fig 6 local production of cytokines .
cytokine production by tlnc cells cultured ex vivo with ova were analysed in all group of mice by elisa .
results for each group are expressed as the mean +/ - sem * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 , alpha p < 0.001 vs n , ns : non - significant ; anova with bonferroni 's test a posteriori .
rtgpi - 1 plus ova treatment decreases allergen - induced t cell proliferation and expands foxp3 + tregs successful immunotherapy significantly generates regulatory cells and reduces allergen - specific t cell proliferation , indicating the induction of peripheral tolerance [ 34 - 36 ] .
hence , we first evaluated allergen - specific tln cell proliferation by 3h - thymidine incorporation during ex vivo culture in the presence of ova .
co - administration of rtgpi - 1 with ova led to decreased proliferative responses ( fig 7b ) .
in addition , splenocytes from the different experimental groups were in - vitro stimulated with ova in order to evaluate rtgpi - 1 modulation at systemic level .
interestingly , intranasal treatment with ova + rtgpi - 1 resulted in a dramatic decrease in allergen - specific t cell proliferation compared to allergic mice ( fig 7d ) .

to assess whether the diminished allergen specific proliferation observed in opi treated mice correlated with increased cd4 + foxp3 + cells , we evaluated the percentage of this population in thoracic lymph nodes and spleen from all experimental groups .
an expansion of cd4 + foxp3 + cells in lymph nodes was detected only in animals that had been co - administered with the serine - protease inhibitor and ova compared to naive mice ( fig 8a and s2 fig ) .
a significant increased percentage of tregs in opi group was also detected at systemic level not only compared to naive ( p < 0.01 ) but also to oo and o mice ( p < 0.05 ) .
similar to lymph nodes , rtgpi - 1 alone treatment did n't result in a higher frequency of cd4 + foxp3 + cells ( fig 8b and s2 fig ) .

discussion the prevalence of ige - mediated allergies is increasing worldwide .
factors including fewer microbial infections in association with the geographical spread of allergens as a consequence of global climate changes are potentially contributing to the rising prevalence of allergic disorders .
steroids , the major therapeutic agents for these disorders , are not an ideal treatment because of the appearance of adverse side effects associated with long - term use [ 2 - 4 ] .
therefore , new strategies for the treatment of ige - mediated disorders have become an important area of investigation .
allergen - specific immunotherapy has emerged as an alternative treatment .
still , at present , this kind of therapy presents several concerns related to the type of vaccine and adjuvant used , route of inoculation , side effects and limited effectiveness .
we have previously demonstrated that both acute and chronic t. gondii infection strongly diminish the development of an allergic airway inflammation [ 33 ] .
the mechanisms behind this phenomenon included the deviation to a th1 phenotype plus the induction of regulatory cells [ 37,38 ] that might result from the activity of many different immunomodulatory proteins .
tgpi - 1 is a toxoplasma gondii protein able to inhibit many serine proteases including trypsin , chymotrypsin , neutrophil elastase [ 12 ] and subtisilin [ 13 ] .
it has been shown that many serine protease inhibitors could modulate the immune response .
the endogenous serine protease inhibitor produced by human epithelial cells ( slpi ) , inhibits inflammatory responses not only by blocking the proteolytic activity of serine proteases released by leukocytes , but also by down modulating lps induced pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 14,39 ] .
in addition , slpi directly affects monocytes by modulating their cytokine secretion pattern , which in turn inhibits the proliferation of cd4 + t cells and th1 cytokine secretion [ 40 ] .
administration of human serum protease inhibitor alpha1 - antitrypsin ( haat ) reduced pro - inflammatory cytokine production via direct modulation of dendritic cell responses [ 41 ] , enhanced il - 10 secretion and expanded tregs [ 16,17,42 ] in many in vivo experimental models .
more recently , it has been shown that b cells are cellular targets of haat .
moreover , haat - induced treg cell expansion appears to be b - cell - dependent [ 18 ] .
these observations showing the immunomodulatory properties of serine - proteases inhibitors , suggest the potential of these molecules as adjuvant candidates for immunotherapy .
it is known that many proteases play key roles in asthma pathophysiology [ 19 - 21 ] .
trypsin [ 26 ] , mast cell tryptase [ 20 ] and neutrophil elastase [ 25 ] are known to be the endogenous stimuli for protease - activated receptor 2 ( par - 2 ) .
this receptor is expressed by a variety of cells including airway epithelial cells , fibroblasts , myocytes , sensory neurons , and bronchial and vascular smooth muscle [ 43 ] , and its activation has been shown to play a role in the development of ahr and airway inflammation [ 44 ] .
it was also shown that in ova - induced experimental asthma models , ova challenges would activate an airway endogenous protease required for allergic lung disease development [ 19 ] .
all this background let us hypothesized that tgpi - 1 might reduce allergic airway inflammation not only by inhibiting serine proteases involved in asthma but also by acting as a tolerogenic molecule .
to our knowledge , few previous studies have evaluated serine - protease inhibitors as experimental asthma modulators [ 27 - 30,45 ] .
in most of them the inhibitor was administered alone during allergen sensitization or during the primary challenge [ 28 - 30 ] .
herein we explored the effect of a recombinant form of tgpi - 1 by using a protocol in which the inhibitor was administered alone or along with the antigen , to mice with already established asthma .
additionally , a week later animals were given a secondary challenge with the allergen .
moreover , herein mice were treated intranasally instead of intraperitoneally as previously performed by koga et al .
[ 45 ] and chen et al .
[ 46 ] .
we understand that our therapeutic model more closely resembles the human situation .
both rtgpi - 1 treatments , alone or co - administered with the allergen , reduced asthma hallmarks : allergic lung inflammation and more importantly airway hyperresponsiveness .
increases in the number of eosinophils in bal , peribronchial cell infiltration and goblet cell metaplasia were all inhibited .
however reduction in airway resistance was more remarkable with the rtgpi - 1 - ova mixture than when mice were treated with rtgpi - 1 without the allergen since a significant reduction of airway resistance was obtained at lower doses of methacholine ( 10 mg / ml ) .
in addition , by comparing the ratio between pulmonary resistance obtained at the methacholine higher dose from each treated group and its corresponding positive control group , an improvement of 56 % in opi vs 26 % in pi was observed .
furthermore , even when compared to o group , co - treatment reduced airway resistance by 38 % .
the difference between mice treated with rtgpi - 1 and rtgpi - 1 plus allergen was also remarkable for allergen specific ige production .
only mice treated with ova plus rtgpi - 1 showed a significant reduction in ova specific ige compared to both asthmatic groups .
these results let us to conclude that treatment with rtgpi - 1 concomitantly with the allergen was more effective .
on the other hand , the fact that i.n. ova administration along with rtgpi - 1 diminished all asthma hallmarks while exposure to ova alone did n't modify the asthma outcome may be explained solely by an anti - inflammatory ability of the protease inhibitor .
however , since ova + rtgpi - 1 treatment resulted more effective than rtgpi - 1 alone , our results suggest that rtgpi - 1 also has adjuvant capacity .
hence , the more effectiveness observed in the co - treatment might be explained by the addition of these two properties .
to address the underlying mechanisms whereby rtgpi - 1 modulates allergen - induced airway inflammation and ahr , tln cytokine levels were measured .
we found that not only the th2 cytokine levels were profoundly inhibited by rtgpi - 1 or rtgpi - 1 + ova treatment , but also the th1 cytokine ifn - gamma , arguing that allergy inhibition was not simply achieved by immune deviation toward a th1 profile .
as we have previously mentioned , effective immunotherapy should result in the induction of allergen specific peripheral tolerance showed as decreased allergen t cell proliferation [ 34,35 ] and increased tregs [ 36 ] .
in this regard and interestingly , our intranasal treatment protocol with rtgpi - 1 plus ova significantly diminished ova - specific proliferation not only locally in tlnc but also systemically .
regulatory il - 10 cytokine down - modulates both type 1 and type 2 cytokines and induces anergy of effector t cells [ 47 ] .
effective treatment with aebsf [ 27,48 ] or nafamostat mesilate [ 46 ] on experimental asthma induced the production of il - 10 .
more recently , kim et al. showed that , in addition to increased levels of il - 10 , treatment of allergic mice with aebsf induce cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + t cells [ 48 ] .
our results do not support a role for this cytokine in this protocol since il - 10 was also diminished in both treated groups .
on the other hand , although a trend to increased tgf - beta levels was observed when rtgpi - 1 was administered along with ova , no significant differences were registered .
still , the reduced proliferative response of tln cells and splenocytes upon ova stimulation , along with the diminished th1 and th2 cytokine secretion suggested the presence of regulatory cells in the treated groups .
in effect , when ova was administered with rtgpi - 1 , significant increased frequency of cd4 + foxp3 + t cells were detected both in thoracic lymph nodes and spleen .
on the other hand , treatment with rtgpi - 1 alone did n't result in higher levels of cd4 + foxp3 + cells nor in a significant reduced ova - specific t - cell proliferation .
these results might explain the better outcome of co - administration of rtgpi - 1 with the allergen .
the fact that targeting proteolytic activity by synthetic inhibitors such as aebsf [ 27,48 ] or nafamostat mesilate [ 46 ] reduces allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model suggests that inhibition of at least some serine proteases should be sufficient for the decrease of the severity of the disease .
however , the effect of rtgpi - 1 on allergic inflammation could be given not only by blocking the activity of proteases but also by still unknown immunomodulatory properties independent of its anti - protease activity .
thus , rtgpi - 1 may act by targeting other molecules beyond serine proteases .
in this regard , jonigk et al showed evidence that the anti - inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of aat can be independent of elastase inhibition [ 49 ] .
hence , the anti - allergic effect of rtgpi - 1 could be explained by several pathways : by inhibiting serine proteases known to be involved in asthma and by inducing tregs which suppresses allergic responses via their ability to inhibit several cell types involved .
conclusions overall , we found that intranasal administration of rtgpi - 1 to allergic mice exerts a therapeutic effect not only by ameliorating pulmonary inflammation but also by improving lung function .
although further studies should be undertaken to completely elucidate the detailed mechanisms by which this t. gondii serine protease inhibitor treatment improves asthma phenotype , rtgpi - 1 appears as a promising candidate for intervention in patients with asthma .
furthermore , treatment with rtgpi - 1 seems to be more effective when administered along with the allergen suggesting that this inhibitor may have adjuvant properties .
these results open the window to future studies to evaluate the adjuvant ability of rtgpi - 1 in allergen specific immunotherapy experimental models .
supporting information s1 fig rtgpi - 1 treatment does n't induce the production of specific antibodies .
forty eight hours after the final challenge , the total circulating volume of blood was taken , serum was collected , and tgpi - 1 - specific igg ( dilution , 1:250 ) , was quantified in naive ( n ) , allergic mice treated with rtgpi - 1 ( pi ) , and allergic mice treated with ova plus rtgpi - 1 ( opi ) .
serum from mice intranasally immunized with rtgpi - 1 with cpg ( tgpi + cpg ) or intramuscularly immunized with rtgpi - 1 with alum ( tgpi + alum ) were used as controls .

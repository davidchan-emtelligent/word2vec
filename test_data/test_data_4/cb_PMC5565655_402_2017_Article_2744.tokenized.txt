introduction up to date , there is a lack of reliable protocols that systematically evaluate the quality of reduction and hardware positioning of surgically treated calcaneal fractures .
based on international consensus , we previously introduced a 23 - item scoring protocol evaluating the reduction and hardware positioning in these fractures based on postoperative computed tomography .
the current study is a reliability analysis of the described scoring protocol .
methods three raters independently and systematically evaluated anonymized postoperative ct scans of 102 surgically treated calcaneal fractures .
a selection of 25 patients was scored twice by all individual raters to calculate intra - rater reliability .
the scoring protocol consisted of 23 items addressing quality of reduction and hardware positioning .
each of these four - option questions was answered as : ' optimal ' , ' suboptimal ( but not needing revision )' , ' not acceptable ( needing revision )' or ' not judgeable ' .
we used intraclass correlation coefficients ( icc 's ) to calculate inter - and intra - rater reliability .
results inter - rater reliability of the overall 23 - item protocol was good ( icc 0.66 , 95 % ci 0.64 - 0.69 ) .
individual items that scored an inter - rater icc >= 0.60 included evaluation of the calcaneocuboid joint , the posterior talocalcaneal joint , the anterior talocalcaneal joint , the position of the plate and sustentaculum screws and screws protruding the tuber and medial wall .
the intra - rater reliability for the overall protocol was good for all three individual raters with icc 's between 0.60 and 0.70 .
conclusion our scoring protocol for the radiological evaluation of operatively treated calcaneal fractures is reliable in terms of inter - and intra - rater reliability .
keywords calcaneus fracture surgical treatment computed tomography evaluation issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag gmbh germany 2017 introduction the main goal of surgical treatment of calcaneal fractures is to restore the anatomy , as intra - articular incongruences are associated with posttraumatic osteoarthritis of the subtalar joint and poor clinical outcomes [ 1 - 3 ] .
to adequately restore the anatomy , different surgical techniques have been proposed [ 4 ] .
to compare the radiological results of these techniques , a blinded , independent radiological assessment with a fixed set of reliable criteria should be standard .
unfortunately , there is lack of a validated scoring protocol on the qualitative assessment of calcaneal fracture reduction and hardware positioning [ 5 - 10 ] .
as evaluation of plain radiography seems insufficient [ 11 ] , different computed tomography ( ct ) based measurements have been proposed [ 12 , 13 ] .
individual studies use different thresholds to specify acceptability of angles or intra - articular congruity [ 8 , 11 , 13 - 16 ] .
additionally , reliability of these measurements is only seldom reported .
a recently published international delphi consensus on how to evaluate postoperative results of surgically treated calcaneal fractures showed that in addition to the quality of reduction , the quality of hardware positioning also requires evaluation [ 17 ] .
additionally , it showed that measurements were performed scarcely in clinical practice ; evaluation of both reduction and hardware positioning is mostly performed by expert opinion .
based on this international consensus , a fixed set of criteria for the assessment of the quality of fracture reduction and hardware positioning of the calcaneus has been composed .
the aim of the current study was to determine the inter - and intra - rater reliability of this radiological scoring protocol .
methods to determine the inter - and intra - rater reliability of the scoring protocol , we used postoperative ct scans of 100 patients with 102 surgically treated calcaneal fractures .
these patients had been enrolled in the ef3x - trial , a multicenter randomized clinical trial exploring the clinical value of additional 3d fluoroscopic imaging in the treatment of calcaneal fractures [ 18 ] .
postoperative ct scans were anonymized and systematically evaluated with use of the scoring protocol by three independent raters [ an experienced foot - and ankle surgeon ( ts ) , a radiologist with specialty in musculoskeletal trauma ( lfb ) , and a surgical trainee in orthopaedic surgery and phd candidate with 4 years of research experience in calcaneal fractures ( rjdmk )] .
no three - dimensional ( volume rendering ) reconstructions were available .
the scoring protocol used was developed after delphi consensus between 18 international experts in the field ( both surgeons and radiologists ) and previously published in this journal [ 17 ] .
the protocol consists of 23 items addressing post - operative reduction and hardware positioning of the most important anatomical landmarks of the calcaneus ( table 2 ) .
each of these multiple - choice questions was answered as : ' optimal ' , ' suboptimal ( but acceptable )' , ' not acceptable ( revision required )' or ' not judgeable ' .
in case of gaps and steps a threshold of 2 mm was held for acceptability [ 19 ] .
after scoring 23 items separately , a concluding dichotomous question was answered about whether any of the findings required correction ( i.e. yes or no ) .
statistical analyses were performed with spss ( ibm spss statistics for windows , version 22.0. armonk , ny , usa ) .
inter - rater reliability we used a two - way random , average measures , absolute agreement intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) to determine the degree of agreement amongst raters , including its 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
as we used a fully crossed design ( all subjects were rated by all raters ) we chose a two - way model [ 20 ] .
as we intended to generalize the results to a larger population of clinicians , we chose a random effects model [ 21 ] .
a good inter - rater reliability ( irr ) was characterized by absolute agreement and not by consistency in the ratings .
concerning interpretation , we expect the protocol to be used in a clinical research environment were postoperative results are scored by more than one rater .
consequently , we primarily calculated the average - measures icc .
we used cutoffs as provided by cicchetti et al. , with reliability being ' poor ' for icc values less than 0.40 , ' fair ' for values between 0.40 and 0.59 , ' good ' for values between 0.60 and 0.74 , and ' excellent ' for values between 0.75 and 1.0 [ 22 ] .
an icc >= 0.60 was set as minimally acceptable level of agreement [ 22 ] .
intra - rater reliability after a minimum of 30 days of scoring , raters were asked to again evaluate a selected subset of 25 ct scans that they had seen before but had been given a new study id. these cases were selected to represent the full range of postoperative results , i.e. from anatomical reduction and correct screw positioning to large intra - articular step - offs , malreduced bohler angles and intra - articular screws - - and everything in between .
scoring results of both sessions were combined in a database per rater to analyze the degree of agreement within the observations ( i.e. intra - rater reliability ) .
in contrast to the inter - rater reliability , we used a two - way mixed , absolute agreement , single measures icc as we wanted to determine the degree of agreement with the raters own ratings and do not intend to extrapolate this to a different rater [ 21 ] .
as for the inter - rater reliability , a good reliability was characterized by absolute agreement and not by consistency in the ratings .
again , cutoffs were used as provided by cicchetti et al .
[ 22 ] .
results the inter - rater reliability of the overall 23 - item protocol was good : icc of 0.66 ( 95 % ci 0.64 - 0.69 ) ( table 1 ) .
individual items that scored an inter - rater icc >= 0.60 included the calcaneocuboid ( cc ) joint ( symmetry / width , intra - articular steps , gaps and screws ) , the posterior talocalcaneal ( ptc ) joint ( symmetry / width , intra - articular steps , gaps and screws ) , the anterior talocalcaneal ( atc ) joint ( intra - articular screws ) , the position of the plate and the sustentaculum screws and screws protruding the tuber and medial wall .
items that did not score acceptable inter - rater agreement ( icc < 0.60 ) included bohler 's and gissane 's angles , length of the calcaneus and varus / valgus position of the tuber , intra - articular fragments in cc , ptc or atc joints , intra - articular gaps and step - offs in the atc and the positioning of anterior process screws .
when only the items that scored an acceptable icc (>= 0.60 ) were combined , the protocol scored 14 items ( table 1 , marked grey ) and had an excellent overall inter - rater reliability with an icc of 0.77 .
table 1 inter - and intra - rater reliability per item .
the intra - rater reliability for the overall protocol was good for all three individual raters with icc 's between 0.60 and 0.70 .
individual raters scored acceptable icc 's for an average of 11 items .
items that scored an icc >= 0.60 for all three raters included steps and gaps in the ptc joint and presence of intra - articular screws in the atc joint .
items that did not score acceptable icc 's with any of the raters included length of the calcaneus , intra - articular fragments and screws in the cc joint , fragments in the ptc joint and gaps in the atc joint .
discussion our scoring protocol assessed quality of both reduction and hardware positioning and showed a good inter - rater reliability based on 300 + observations , suggesting sufficient reliability for use in clinical and research settings .
it can aid future studies in the structural comparison of treatment results in the field of operatively treated calcaneal fractures , where there is currently no practicable alternative .
calcaneal fractures are often complex and classification systems typically show poor to moderate inter - rater reliability [ 23 ] .
scoring protocols on the postoperative evaluation of these fractures are numerous , but often do not mention data on reliability or only focus on ( parts of ) fracture reduction .
in 2003 , gupta et al. used pre - and postoperative ct scans to measure 7 displacement parameters in 32 calcaneal fractures .
measurements were done by a single rater without providing intra - rater reliability [ 12 ] .
sahota et al. focused on the postoperative alignment of the posterior facet [ 24 ] .
they reported excellent inter - rater reliability between three independent raters by comparing ten postoperative ct scans .
kurozumi et al. evaluated parameters of calcaneal deformity by comparing postoperative ct images of both the injured and healthy contralateral side [ 13 ] .
they found better reduction of the posterior facet and better reduction of the calcaneocuboid joint to be prognostic factors of functional outcome , but did not provide data on reliability of their measurements .
in 2010 , magnan et al. performed postoperative ct analysis of 54 patients with calcaneal fractures using the score analysis of verona ( save ) [ 4 , 25 ] .
the save scoring system was specifically designed for ct evaluation of calcaneal fractures and describes five displacement parameters [ 4 , 25 ] .
after a mean follow - up of 49 months , parts of the score showed statistical correlation with the clinical outcome as judged by the maryland foot score : better clinical outcomes showed a significant association with vertical / longitudinal realignment and restoration of the calcaneal height [ 25 ] .
despite its correlation with clinical outcome , data on the reliability of the save scoring system is currently unavailable .
finally , in 2014 , sanders et al. described a long term follow - up of 108 surgically treated patients with his well - known sanders classification [ 26 ] .
in addition to his traditional fracture classification [ 27 ] , he added measurements of posterior facet congruity , dividing the extent of anatomic reduction in four categories .
they confirmed that after 10 - 20 years of follow - up , the classification was still prognostic for outcome , as worsening outcome occurred with higher sanders fracture types .
however , included patients only had one of two types ( sanders ii vs sanders iii ) .
no data on reliability were published .
although all abovementioned scoring systems were specifically designed for post - operative evaluation , none of them assessed hardware positioning such as presence of intra - articular or medially protruding screws .
we have chosen to base this scoring protocol on ct imaging as it is currently the golden standard with respect to the visualization of intra - articular gaps , step - offs and hardware positioning [ 13 ] .
nonetheless , despite its qualities , some measurements might be poorly visible on ct imaging .
bohler 's and gissane 's angle measurements were originally designed for lateral radiographs .
we hypothesized that estimation of these angles could be done by scrolling through the sagittal reconstructions of the ct scan .
in addition , as mentioned by kurozumi et al. , bohler 's angle comprises multiple factors : anterior lateral wall , ptc , and tuber displacement : all of which are evaluated separately with ct imaging [ 13 ] .
still , in line with the existing literature , we did not produce high reliability of bohler 's and gissane 's angle measurements on ct [ 23 , 28 ] .
the posterior talocalcaneal ( ptc ) is widely regarded as having the largest impact on post - operative complaints [ 29 - 32 ] .
in contrast to measurements of bohler 's angle , measurements of the ptc joint scored good agreement on four out of five items .
the presence or absence of intra - articular bone fragments scored only fair agreement , possibly due to disagreement with regard to the posterior limits of the ptc joint .
on a statistical note , reliability analyses are frequently reported by the percentage that raters agree in their ratings , often referred to as percentage agreement .
however , this measure systematically overestimates the level of agreement by not correcting for agreement that would be expected by chance alone [ 20 ] .
the intraclass correlation or icc is a measure that is suitable for ordinal , interval and ratio variables .
it incorporates the magnitude of disagreement as does a weighted kappa , but has the advantage that it can handle more than two raters [ 33 ] .
to accurately calculate inter - rater reliability , sufficient variance in the observed cohort is indispensable .
for instance , very low prevalence of intra - articular screws in the cc joint can cause a low icc .
the low variance for this item is expressed by a broad range of the 95 % confidence interval , suggesting a low representability of the icc .
some items have a high inter - rater (> 0.6 ) but a low (< 0.6 ) intra - rater reliability within individual raters .
raters can agree with each other at a certain moment , but not with themselves the next .
this variability is inherent to classification systems , and in our case , does not hamper the good overall reliability of the scoring protocol .
instead of exact measurements that are mostly performed in research settings , we have used subjective evaluations ( e.g. good , moderate or poor ) .
subjective evaluation dismisses the need for tedious measurements , thereby allowing for a broader , more extensive evaluation without extending the burden of the task .
in addition , subjective ( categorical ) and objective ( numerical values ) evaluations have previously proven to have a good correlation [ 34 ] .
moreover , during surgery no measurements can be performed and all the surgeon can do is estimate the quality of reduction and fixation , based on his experience with the acceptable angle measurements and distances .
this is also where a potential underestimation of the inter - rater reliability comes in : we used raters with sufficient expertise , but a different background .
a radiologists' perspective is likely to be different to that of a foot and ankle surgeon , especially when asked for a subjective opinion ; e.g. the term " acceptable " could have different meanings for the two based on ( a lack of ) surgical experience .
undoubtedly , inter - rater reliability suffers from this phenomenon and is expected to be higher when rating is performed solely by experienced foot and ankle surgeons .
in the original study published in this journal we concluded that more items required evaluation than traditionally used in scoring protocols [ 17 ] .
however , the current study shows that many of the 23 items scored do not show sufficient inter - rater reliability .
if we would design a protocol using only the items that scored an inter - rater reliability of 0.6 or higher , this protocol would evaluate 14 items and have an excellent reliability with an icc of 0.77 .
this would , however , discard the previously mentioned consensus and potentially ignore items with high predictive value of functional outcome .
future studies should focus on identifying which items indeed correlate with functional outcome to help optimize the reliability and usability of the current protocol .
in conclusion , the results of the present study show that our previously developed scoring protocol for the radiological evaluation of operatively treated calcaneal fractures is reliable in regard to inter - and intra - rater reliability .
the scoring protocol can be used in future clinical research settings that focus on the radiological comparison of operatively treated fractures of the calcaneus .

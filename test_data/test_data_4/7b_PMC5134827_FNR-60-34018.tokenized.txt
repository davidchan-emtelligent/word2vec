having completed my second year as editor - in - chief of food & nutrition research ( fnr ) , i wish to recognize the energy and passion of everyone involved in contributing to and operating this journal .
human capital is responsible for the creation of fnr as the dynamic publication of it spans from the authors who contribute their work to our editors to our reviewers - all of whom seek to work in a timely manner , while facing their own demanding time schedules .
fnr is certainly ahead of the times , delivering up - to - date nutrition research that now reaches nearly the entire globe online .
there are many great and powerful moments that go on behind the scenes of fnr and i have had the opportunity to both experience these moments and celebrate them over the last 2 years .
as 2016 comes to an end , we can conclude that it marks a successful and busy year .
in terms of output , fnr has been productive , 100 papers published for the first time , which represents a significant growth in comparison with 2015 .
in other areas of growth and change , our publisher co - action publishing joined the taylor & francis group , one of the world 's leading publishing houses .
i believe that this new publishing environment along with the continued support of the swedish nutrition foundation will contribute actively to the further development and direction of fnr .
as part of the many steps being taken to manage the growth of the journal , new editors are being appointed and the fnr editorial board is being updated .
editors and the board are expected to contribute actively to developing the journal and to its governance .
we will be holding a virtual meeting in the coming months to disseminate all our plans and receive feedback from the board members .
on a personal level , i would like to acknowledge the considerable contribution and efforts of the editorial team , namely the editors per ole iversen , wendy russell , and kenneth maleta and our newly appointed statistical advisor abhik ghosh .
moreover , i wish to express my gratitude to veronica svard and caroline sutton of co - action publishing , and anneli hovstadius and nina jansson from the swedish nutrition foundation , for their considerable support and patience as we have grown the journal together .
looking forward , the focus of fnr will remain unchanged , namely on publishing nutrition research as outlined on the fnr website .
in conclusion , we thank all the authors and reviewers for their efforts in developing these studies to a satisfactory outcome .
we invite nutrition researchers to submit their original work to fnr and to future special issues .
please do not hesitate to contact me or other members of the editorial team if you feel you can contribute to the further development of the journal .
best wishes for a wonderful holiday season and have a very happy new year 2017 !

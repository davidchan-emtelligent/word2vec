activation of gsk - 3beta is presumed to be involved in various neurodegenerative diseases , including alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) , which is characterized by memory disturbances during early stages of the disease .
the normal function of gsk - 3beta in adult brain is not well understood .
here , we analyzed the ability of heterozygote gsk - 3beta knockout ( gsk +/ - ) mice to form memories .
in the morris water maze ( mwm ) , learning and memory performance of gsk +/ - mice was no different from that of wild - type ( wt ) mice for the first 3 days of training. with continued learning on subsequent days , however , retrograde amnesia was induced in gsk +/ - mice , suggesting that gsk +/ - mice might be impaired in their ability to form long - term memories .
in contextual fear conditioning ( cfc ) , context memory was normally consolidated in gsk +/ - mice , but once the original memory was reactivated , they showed reduced freezing , suggesting that gsk +/ - mice had impaired memory reconsolidation .
biochemical analysis showed that gsk - 3beta was activated after memory reactivation in wt mice .
intraperitoneal injection of a gsk - 3 inhibitor before memory reactivation impaired memory reconsolidation in wt mice .
these results suggest that memory reconsolidation requires activation of gsk - 3beta in the adult brain .
introduction two gsk - 3 isoforms ( alpha and beta ) are encoded by different genes in mammalian tissues [ 1 ] .
gsk - 3beta is highly enriched in the brain , where it phosphorylates metabolic enzymes , signal proteins , structural proteins , and transcription factors [ 2 ] - [ 4 ] .
gsk - 3beta is a constitutively active kinase .
most gsk - 3beta substrates are under negative regulation , which is relieved by ser9 phosphorylation through other kinases such as pkc , pka , and akt [ 3 ] .
gsk - 3 inhibitor experiments suggest that gsk - 3 may be involved in mood disorders , schizophrenia , and pathogenesis of neurofibrillary tangles ( nfts ) [ 4 ] - [ 7 ] .
nfts , neuropathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders , are composed of highly phosphorylated tau [ 8 ] - [ 10 ] .
gsk - 3beta is an enzyme potentially involved in forming highly phosphorylated tau in nfts [ 11 ] - [ 14 ] .
this hypothesis is supported by the observation that a gsk - 3 inhibitor prevents nft formation in an animal model [ 4 ] , [ 15 ] .
aggregated abeta activates gsk - 3beta and induces hyperphosphorylation of tau and neuronal death [ 14 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
furthermore , the overexpression of gsk - 3beta affects spatial memory and accelerates nft formation in a mouse model [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
this accumulating evidence suggests that activation of gsk - 3beta may be involved in nft formation and neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases , including alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) .
one hypothesis explaining the role of gsk - 3beta in the adult brain posits that under normal conditions , gsk - 3beta is inhibited and does not affect brain function .
however , in disease states , gsk - 3beta becomes activated through the elimination of inactivation signals , leading to neurodegeneration .
this hypothesis provides the basis for the development of gsk - 3beta inhibitors as potential therapeutic drugs for treating ad and other neurodegenerative diseases .
however , it is inconceivable that a constitutively active kinase such as gsk - 3beta exists for the purpose of neurodegeneration .
recently , peineau et al .
[ 20 ] reported the importance of gsk - 3beta activity during the induction of long term depression ( ltd ) , suggesting that gsk - 3beta activity may contribute to the control of synaptic plasticity and memory function .
if gsk - 3beta is involved only in neurodegeneration , then a genetic reduction of gsk - 3beta would not be expected to affect cognitive function .
on the other hand , if gsk - 3beta is involved in normal brain function , a genetic reduction of gsk - 3beta would be expected to affect cognitive function .
to test this hypothesis , we compared memory formation and maintenance of heterozygous gsk - 3beta gene - deficient mice ( gsk +/ - ) and their wild - type ( wt ) littermates using the morris water maze ( mwm ) test and a contextual fear - conditioning ( cfc ) test .
gsk +/ - mice lacked the ability to maintain memory after recall , suggesting gsk - 3beta importantly contributes to memory maintenance after recall in normal brains .
results generation and characterization of gsk +/ - to understand the normal role of gsk - 3beta in the adult brain , we generated gsk - 3beta gene - deficient mice according to published methods [ 21 ] and analyzed heterozygous gsk - 3beta gene - deficient ( gsk +/ - ) mice .
the total amount of gsk - 3beta in gsk +/ - mice was approximately 50 % of that in wt littermate mice , whereas the relative activity of gsk - 3beta in gsk +/ - mice was about 70 % of that in wt littermates ( see supporting information fig. s1 ) .
as previously reported [ 21 ] , gsk +/ - mice were healthy , fertile , had normal circadian rhythms and life span , but had unimpaired motor and locomotor activity compared to their wt littermates ( see supporting information fig. s2 ) .
this was the case even though they had reduced gsk - 3beta activity and lacked gsk - 3alpha compensation ( see supporting information fig. s1 ) .
gsk +/ - mice exhibited retrograde amnesia with repeated training in mwm adult mice ( 7 - 14 months old ) were trained 3 times a day to find a fixed but hidden platform submerged in a circular pool ; training occurred for 3 or 9 days .
memory performance was measured in terms of an error score , which represents the cumulative distance a mouse traveled in each trial as it searched to find the hidden platform .
the error score more accurately and sensitively reflects a mouse 's place preference in a trial than other parameters ( supporting information fig. s3 ). fig. 1a , b show the average error scores of the mice during the training .
during the first 3 days of training , gsk +/ - mice learned to navigate to the hidden platform and had low error scores comparable to those of wt littermate mice ( fig. 1a ) .
in the probe test , which was conducted after 3 days of continuous training , gsk +/ - mice recognized the place where the platform used to be as well as the wt mice ( fig. 1d ) .
however , with more than 3 days of continuous training ( 9 days of training ) , gsk +/ - mice took longer than wt mice to locate the hidden platform .
their error scores increased , while the error scores of wt mice decreased steadily , indicating that the wt mice had effectively learned the location of the platform during the additional training days ( fig. 1b ) .
to evaluate the spatial memory of gsk +/ - mice , we conducted a probe test 24 h after the last session on the ninth training day .
in the probe test , gsk +/ - mice did not show statistically significant place preference ( fig. 1e ) .
however , gsk +/ - mice that received 3 days of training ( fig. 1e ) and wt mice that received 9 days of training ( fig. 1f ) did show significant place preference .
thus , gsk +/ - mice failed to locate the previous location of the hidden platform , while wt mice located the platform easily , indicating that wt mice had retained place recognition , whereas gsk +/ - mice did not ( fig. 1e ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003540.g001 figure 1 analysis of place learning and memory in gsk - 3beta heterozygous mice .
the morris water maze ( mwm ) was used to assess place learning and memory of adult wt littermate and gsk +/ - mice ( 7 - 14 months old ) .
the cognitive function of 7 - to 14 - month - old mice did not show age - dependent decline ( supporting information fig. s5 ) .
memory was assessed after 3 days of continuous training ( a , d ) ; 9 days of continuous training ( b , e ) ; and 3 days of reversal testing following the 9 - day continuous training session ( c , f ) .
learning is expressed as error scores ( a , b , c ) , and memory performance is expressed as a percentage of total time spent in the target quadrant during the probe test ( d , e , f ) .
the probe test was given on the fourth day ( d , f ) or tenth day ( e ) of the experiment ( see methods ) .
differences between genotypes were statistically analyzed with a two - way anova ( a - c ) .
dwell times of gsk +/ - and wt littermate mice spent in the target ( t ) , adjacent ( a ) , and opposite ( o ) quadrants were statistically analyzed by one - way anova ( d - f ) .
results are expressed as means +/ - sem .
after 9 days of training , we moved the hidden platform to a quadrant opposite to that of the previous training session and continued training the mice .
as with the initial test ( fig. 1a ) , gsk +/ - mice learned the place of the relocated platform during the first 3 days of training ( fig. 1c ) , showing comparable spatial memory to that of their wt littermates ( fig. 1f ) .
the swimming speed ( motor control ability ) and thigmotaxic tendency ( emotional control ability ) of gsk +/ - and wt littermate mice on the first day of training were not significantly different ( supporting information fig. s4 ) , suggesting that motor and emotional factors could not account for group differences in mwm performance .
the relatively wide range of ages of the mice ( 7 - 14 months ) could not account for differences in cognitive ability of wt and gsk +/ - mice ( supporting information fig. s5 ) .
therefore , these results were due to genetic differences between the mice , and suggest that , although they retained the ability to learn , gsk +/ - mice exhibited retrograde amnesia with repeated training .
thus , gsk - 3beta reduction does not affect the learning process but does affect the memory maintenance system , such as memory consolidation and / or reconsolidation .
gsk +/ - impairs memory reconsolidation a new memory is initially labile and becomes stabilized over time through the process of consolidation .
once stabilized , memory is not permanently fixed and can again become labile if reactivated by recall , which is called reconsolidation .
the reconsolidation process is hypothesized to be necessary for updating reactivated memories [ 22 ] .
although memory consolidation and reconsolidation are thought to have distinct molecular requirements , both require a protein synthesis - dependent process [ 24 ] - [ 29 ] .
to understand in which process gsk - 3beta is involved , we examined gsk +/ - mice in a cfc paradigm .
gsk +/ - and wt littermate mice showed similar freezing times in response to the unconditioning stimulus ( us ) .
twenty - four hours after exposure to the us , mice in the reconsolidation test group were placed in the same context ( conditioning stimulus ; cs ) again without the us to reactivate their memory by recall .
mice in the consolidation group did not receive memory reactivation until the test phase .
on day 7 , memory performance of both the consolidation and reconsolidation test groups ( fig. 2a ) was examined by measuring freezing time .
in the consolidation test , gsk +/ - and wt littermate mice showed the same level of freezing ( fig. 2b ) , suggesting that gsk +/ - mice are not impaired in the ability to form and consolidate memory .
furthermore , the consolidated memory is maintained for at least 7 days .
in contrast , gsk +/ - mice showed significantly less freezing in the reconsolidation test on day 7 compared to wt littermate mice ( fig. 2c ) .
comparison of day 1 and day 7 freezing times in the reconsolidation test ( fig. 2a ) revealed that the freezing times of gsk +/ - mice decreased significantly from day 1 to day 7 ( fig. 2e ) , while those of wt littermate mice remained more or less unchanged ( fig. 2d ) .
these results indicate that gsk +/ - mice learned and that their memory stabilized over 7 days if memory was not reactivated .
however , gsk +/ - mice failed to achieve reconsolidation when the memory was reactivated once before testing .
therefore , gsk +/ - mice show retrograde amnesia in the cfc reconsolidation test as well as in the mwm test , suggesting that gsk +/ - mice may have impaired memory reconsolidation .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003540.g002 figure 2 memory consolidation and reconsolidation in gsk - 3beta heterozygous mice .
memory consolidation and reconsolidation were assessed with a contextual fear - conditioning ( cfc ) test following the schedule shown in a. mice were placed in a novel environment ( plastic chamber ) for 5 min ( conditioning stimulus , cs ) , where they received three electrical foot shocks ( unconditioning stimulus , us ; shock intensity = 0.5 mv ; duration = 2 sec ; inter - stimuli interval = 60 sec ) .
in the consolidation test performed 7 days later , the mice ( wt littermates , n = 13 ; gsk +/ - , n = 14 ; 7 - 14 months old ) were placed into the plastic chamber again for 5 min without receiving stimulation , and freezing time was measured ( a , b ) .
in the reconsolidation test performed on day 1 and day 7 of training , the mice ( wt littermates , n = 17 ; gsk +/ - , n = 11 ) were placed into the plastic chamber again for 5 min without receiving stimulation , and freezing time was measured ( a , c - e ) .
on day 7 of the consolidation test ( b ) , the freezing times of wt littermate ( white bar ) and gsk +/ - ( black bar ) mice were not significantly different ( p = 0.437 , mann - whitney test ) .
however , on day 7 of the reconsolidation test , the freezing times of gsk +/ - mice had decreased significantly compared to that of their wt littermates ( c ; p = 0.0026 , mann - whitney test ) .
comparison of day 1 and day 7 freezing times of wt littermate ( d ) and gsk +/ - ( e ) mice revealed that , on day 7 of the reconsolidation test , gsk +/ - mice showed significantly reduced freezing times ( p = 0.0095 , mann - whitney test ) , while wt littermate mice did not ( p > 0.0733 , mann - whitney test ) .
results are expressed as means +/ - sem ; ** , p < 0.01 .
memory reconsolidation requires the activation of gsk - 3beta to confirm the involvement of gsk - 3beta in memory reconsolidation , we first investigated gsk - 3beta activity in c57bl / 6j mice during consolidation and reconsolidation in a cfc paradigm .
recently , gsk - 3beta in synapses have been reported to be involved in synaptic plasticity [ 20 ] .
this prompted us to examine gsk - 3beta activity in synaptic fractions from mouse hippocampus relative to levels of phospho - ser9 gsk - 3beta ( fig. 3b , c ) .
one and twenty - four hours after cs + us presentation , phospho - ser9 gsk - 3beta levels were reduced to about 72 % of that of the control group , which did not receive the cs + us presentation , suggesting that gsk - 3beta was activated during memory consolidation .
one hour after cs presentation during the reconsolidation step , phospho - ser9 gsk - 3beta levels were further and significantly reduced to 50 % of control levels ( fig. 3a , c ) , suggesting that gsk - 3beta might be activated during memory consolidation and an additional activation of gsk - 3beta might be required during the reconsolidation process .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0003540.g003 figure 3 memory reconsolidation requires gsk - 3beta activation .
c57bl / 6j mice ( 7 months old ) received contextual fear conditioning according to the test schedule shown in a. hippocampal gsk - 3beta levels were then assessed at different times during the testing .
one and twenty - four hours after the presentation of paired conditioned and unconditioned stimuli ( cs + us ) , mice were killed and phospho - ser9 gsk - 3beta and total gsk - 3beta levels in hippocampal synaptic fractions were analyzed by western blotting ( b , c ) .
gsk - 3beta was found in the synaptic ( s ) fraction ( b ) .
mice showed reduced phospho - ser9 gsk - 3beta levels after learning and during consolidation and reconsolidation compared to levels measured during " no learning " ( c ; upper panel ) .
ratios of phospho - ser9 gsk - 3beta - to - total gsk - 3beta levels , which reflect the inhibition of gsk - 3beta activity , are shown in the histogram of panel of c. gsk - 3beta activity after learning ( n = 5 ) and during consolidation ( n = 5 ) was significantly increased compared to activity measured in the " no learning " group ( n = 7 ) .
further significant gsk - 3beta activation was seen in the reconsolidation group ( n = 4 ) .
statistical analysis was performed using the tukey 's multiple comparison test after one - way anova ; * , p < 0.05 ; ** , p < 0.01 ; *** , p,0.001 .
effects of a gsk - 3 inhibitor on memory consolidation and reconsolidation ( d - f ) .
times at which mice received an intraperitoneal injection of gsk - 3 inhibitor and the task schedule for contextual fear conditioning are shown in d. four groups of c57bl / 6j mice were intraperitoneally injected with either gsk - 3 inhibitor ( ar - a014418 ; 30 mg / kg ) or vehicle solution ( approximately 100 microl of 10 % dmso / 40 % peg solution for each animal ) 1 h before consolidation ( vehicle , n = 8 ; inhibitor , n = 8 ) or reconsolidation ( vehicle , n = 8 ; inhibitor , n = 9 ) .
on day 7 , memory performance was assessed by measuring freezing times under cs conditions .
gsk - 3 inhibitor administered before conditioning did not significantly affect memory performance on day 7 ( e ; p = 0.798 , mann - whitney test ) .
in contrast , when gsk - 3 inhibitor was administered before reconsolidation , on day 7 freezing times of gsk - 3 inhibitor - treated mice were significantly less than those of vehicle - treated mice ( f ; p = 0.036 , mann - whitney test ) .
results are expressed as means +/ - sem ; * , p < 0.05 .
if this additional gsk - 3beta activation is involved in memory reconsolidation , inhibition of gsk - 3 might produce the same effects on memory reconsolidation as that observed in gsk +/ - mice .
thus , we next investigated the effect of gsk - 3beta inhibition on memory maintenance by intraperitoneal injection of the gsk - 3 inhibitor ar - a014418 ( 30 mg / kg ) , followed by training on the cfc paradigm .
to confirm inhibition of gsk - 3 , c57bl / 6j mice were treated with the gsk - 3 inhibitor before the consolidation step or before the reconsolidation step ( 1 h before cs + us presentation in the consolidation test , or 1 h before cs presentation in the reconsolidation test , respectively ; fig. 3d ) .
the gsk - 3 inhibitor reduced tau phosphorylation by 70 % compared to the vehicle control , suggesting that the treatment inhibited gsk - 3 activity ( see supporting information fig. s6 ) .
inhibiting gsk - 3 before the consolidation step did not impair memory consolidation ( fig. 3e ) , but gsk - 3 inhibition applied before the reconsolidation step significantly impaired memory reconsolidation ( fig. 3f ) .
thus , the memory reconsolidation step is more sensitive to gsk - 3beta activity than the memory consolidation step , and these results indicate that activation of gsk - 3beta might be required for memory reconsolidation .
discussion the genetic reduction of gsk - 3beta and the pharmacological inhibition of gsk - 3 impaired reconsolidation of hippocampus - dependent place memory , as demonstrated in the cfc test , a test that assesses hippocampus - mediated memory consolidation and reconsolidation .
hence , gsk - 3beta may be involved in memory reconsolidation in the hippocampus .
the mechanism of memory formation and maintenance in the hippocampus , however , may also involve coordinated activity in other brain regions .
clearly , more work is needed to clarify the role of gsk - 3beta in cortex and other brain regions .
although mice expressing the dominant negative form of gsk - 3 display neuronal damage in striatum and cortex accompanied by impaired limb mobility [ 30 ] , gsk +/ - mice did not display these phenomena .
this discrepancy may due to gsk - 3alpha activity .
although gsk +/ - reduces gsk - 3beta activity without affecting gsk - 3alpha , dominant negative gsk - 3 reduces both gsk - 3alpha and gsk - 3beta activity in striatum and cortex .
this reduction may cause neuronal vulnerability .
both place learning in the mwm and context learning in the cfc paradigm reflect mainly hippocampal - dependent learning and memory .
gsk +/ - mice showed retrograde amnesia in the mwm and cfc paradigms .
using the cfc paradigm , we demonstrated that gsk +/ - , or pharmacological inhibition of gsk - 3 , impaired memory reconsolidation without affecting memory consolidation .
therefore , gsk +/ - mice - - in which gsk - 3beta is genetically reduced - - and wt mice treated with a gsk - 3 inhibitor lose their ability to reconsolidate memory .
injecting a protein synthesis inhibitor ( anisomycin ) into dorsal hippocampus inhibits memory consolidation and reconsolidation in both place and context learning [ 31 ] - [ 33 ] .
thus , if gsk - 3beta is involved in a common mechanism of memory reconsolidation shared by both tasks , we would expect that the genetic reduction of gsk - 3beta to also impair memory reconsolidation of affected mice .
indeed , gsk +/ - mice did display impaired memory reconsolidation in both mwm and cfc tests .
during the first 3 days of training , gsk +/ - mice did not exhibit memory impairment ( fig. 1d ) .
however , after 9 days of repetitive training , gsk +/ - mice exhibited retrograde amnesia ( fig. 1e ) .
artinian and colleagues [ 31 ] found that injecting anisomycin into ca3 after a single reactivation , inhibited memory reconsolidation following 4 sessions of three trials in one day in a place - learning version of the mwm paradigm .
in our mwm training protocol , mice were repeatedly trained three trials everyday .
the strength of memory in each day in our mwm protocol seems to be weaker than that in artinians' protocol .
the temporal dynamics of memory reconsolidation depend on the strength and age of the memory , such that younger and weaker memories are more easily reconsolidated than older and stronger ones [ 34 ] .
therefore , more than three days of repetitive training may be required for inhibiting memory reconsolidation by genetic reduction of gsk - 3beta ( gsk +/ - ) under our mwm protocol .
one caveat in interpreting a retrograde amnesia effect in the cfc paradigm is the possibility of extinction of the conditioned response , because retrograde amnesia in repeated exposure to the same context without reinforcement can produce extinction .
therefore , it is possible that gsk - 3beta inhibition - induced retrograde amnesia may be due to facilitation of extinction or impairment of reconsolidation .
however , the facilitation - of - extinction notion cannot explain the result showing that gsk +/ - mice displayed retrograde amnesia upon repetitive training in the mwm .
since maintenance of spatial memory in the mwm requires memory consolidation and reconsolidation [ 27 ] and since mwm training is performed under the existence of a reinforcer , spatial memory may not be affected by memory extinction .
therefore , retrograde amnesia related to gsk - 3beta inhibition could be due to an impairment of memory reconsolidation , not to facilitation of extinction .
nmda - induced bidirectional synaptic plasticity ( long term potentiation , ltp ; long term depression , ltd ) is believed to underlie memory formation [ 35 ] .
during ltp , neurons store relevant information by synaptic tagging , which is thought to underlie a stable memory trace [ 36 ] .
recently , gsk - 3beta activation has been reported to be required for nmda - dependent ltd induction [ 20 ] .
furthermore , overexpression of gsk - 3beta inhibits ltp induction [ 37 ] .
therefore , gsk - 3beta could modulate the balancing of ltp and ltd in an activity - dependent manner .
overexpression of gsk - 3beta impairs acquisition of reference memory in a novel object recognition task [ 38 ] .
as we have shown in this report , the inhibition of gsk - 3beta blocks memory reconsolidation but not memory acquisition or consolidation .
these observations suggest that activated gsk - 3beta may contribute to memory reconsolidation by controlling ltp / ltd balance .
if ltp and ltd contribute to the formation and maintenance of memory traces , memory acquisition and consolidation processes may preferentially depend on ltp .
in the case of memory reconsolidation , ltd may be more important for maintaining a prior potentiated circuit by competitive synaptic maintenance [ 39 ] .
gsk - 3beta activation may help protect a stable memory trace from corruption through additional synaptic connections or changes during recall and reconsolidation .
although this idea may be supported by the observation that greater activation of gsk - 3beta is required in the reconsolidation process rather than in the consolidation process , more precise mechanisms need to be clarified .
gsk - 3beta is involved in nft formation in ad. during normal aging , nfts are observed in the entorhinal cortex .
this may represent a very early pathological change of sporadic ad. because memory reconsolidation is required for gsk - 3beta activation , tau might be hyperphosphorylated when memory is reconsolidated .
as we recently reported , the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau impairs learning and memory during old age [ 40 ] .
therefore , frequent activation of memory reconsolidation in older brains may damage learning and memory through the hyperphosphorylation of tau .
thus , gsk - 3beta does have an important role in memory maintenance in the adult brain , but it may also cause nft formation in the aged brain .
materials and methods animals male c57 / bl6j mice aged ~ 7 months were used for all experiments .
male gsk +/ - mice ( 7 - 14 months ) were maintained by backcrossing with c57 / bl6j mice .
mice were individually housed and kept on a 12 - h light / dark schedule .
all mice had free access to food and water .
to assess gsk - 3beta activation during memory consolidation and reconsolidation , we subjected c57bl / 6j mice to a cfc paradigm .
at the indicated time points shown in fig. 3a , mice were killed by cervical dislocation and their hippocampi were removed and prepared for biochemical analysis of gsk - 3beta .
all experiments were performed according to procedures approved by the animal experiments committee of the institute of physical and chemical research ( riken ) .
antibodies we used the following antibodies : rabbit polyclonal anti - gsk - 3 , mouse monoclonal anti - gsk - 3beta ( transduction lab , inc. ) ; rabbit polyclonal anti - phospho - ser9 gsk - 3beta ( cell signaling technology , inc. ) .
western blotting mouse hippocampi were homogenized in tris - buffered saline ( tbs ; 10 mm tris , 150 mm nacl [ ph 7.4 ]) containing protease inhibitors ( 1 microg / ml antipine , 5 microg / ml pepstatin , 5 microg / ml leupeptin , 2 microg / ml aprotinin , and 0.5 microm 4 - ( 2 - aminoethyl ) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( 1 mm naf , 0.4 mm na3vo4 , and 0.5 mm okadaic acid ) .
after centrifugation at 27,000 g for 20 min , the supernatant was collected .
tbs - soluble materials were solubilized in laemmli sample buffer and subjected to sds - page .
next , we purified synaptic fractions from hippocampus .
hippocampi from mouse brains were homogenized in 8 volumes of 10 mm hepes buffer containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors , 5 mm edta , and 300 mm sucrose , and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min .
the supernatant was centrifuged at 39,800 g for 40 min , and the nuclear fraction was completely removed .
the synaptic fraction was purified from the supernatant by centrifugation at 120,000 g for 40 min .
the cytoplasmic fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 260,000 g for 2 h. synaptic and cytoplasmic fractions were subjected to sds - page , and separated proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes ( schleicher & schuell bioscience ) .
the membranes were then incubated with primary antibody , followed by the species - appropriate hrp - conjugated secondary antibody .
chemiluminescent detection ( ecl ; ge healthcare bio science ) was used for visualization .
quantitation and visual analysis of immunoreactivity were performed with a computer - linked las - 3000 bio - imaging analyzer system ( fujifilm ) .
morris water maze test to assess place learning and memory performance of mice , we used a cylindrical test apparatus ( 1 m in diameter ) and task closely fashioned after the morris water maze according to our previous report [ 35 ] .
to assess learning , for each mouse we calculated the distance between the mouse and the platform every 0.5 sec until the mouse reached the platform .
next , we calculated the total distance traveled by the mouse as it searched for the platform .
this error score was used as a measure of learning performance .
lower scores indicated better learning and memory .
each mouse was subjected to three learning trials per day for nine successive days .
a single probe test was given on the tenth day , in which the platform was removed from the maze in the mouse 's absence .
the mouse was introduced into the maze as before and allowed to search for the missing platform for 60 sec .
the percentage of time the mouse spent searching in each quadrant was used as an index of memory performance .
statistical analyses were conducted using prism4 ( graphpad software inc. ) .
data were analyzed using the friedman test or two - way anova , unless noted otherwise .
contextual fear - conditioning ( cfc ) test for memory consolidation and reconsolidation to test the effect of gsk - 3beta reduction on memory consolidation and reconsolidation , gsk +/ - mice and gsk - 3 inhibitor - treated c57bl / 6j mice were randomly selected and assessed on a cfc test .
the test apparatus consisted of a 60 cmx40 cmx40 cm sound - proof box containing a 10 cmx10 cmx10 cm transparent plastic chamber with a steel grid floor ( for delivering electrical foot shocks ) and a ccd camera .
to examine memory consolidation , we exposed individual to the novel environment ( plastic chamber ) for 5 min ( conditioning stimulus , cs ) , and then delivered three sequential foot shocks ( unconditioning stimulus , us ; shock intensity = 0.5 mv ; duration = 2 sec ; inter - stimuli interval = 60 sec ) .
seven days after cs presentation , conditioned animals were re - exposed to the same plastic chamber for 4 min , and freezing time was measured with custom software based on matlab ( version 7.2 , mathworks co. ltd. ) .
to examine memory reconsolidation , we exposed mice to the environmental cs for 5 min .
one day after cs presentation , conditioned animals were exposed to the same plastic chamber for 4 min , and freezing time was monitored as before .
six days after first being exposed to the same plastic chamber , mice were re - exposed to the chamber , and memory reconsolidation was assessed by measuring freezing time .
the same behavioral analyses were applied in experiments testing the affect of gsk - 3 inhibition on c57bl / 6j mice and biochemical analysis of gsk - 3beta activity during contextual fear conditioning .
supporting information figure s1 generation of gsk - 3beta heterozygote mouse .
using homologous recombination , we flanked the exon - encoding catalytic domain of gsk - 3beta with loxp elements .
floxed gsk - 3beta mice were crossed with mice expressing cre recombinase under the control of the eiia promoter , and their progeny were crossed with c57 / bl6j mice ( a ) .
the offspring of this latter cross underwent pcr tail dna analysis using the primer sets indicated , and mice harboring the delta allele were selected ( b ) .
the brains of six wild - type ( gsk - 3beta +/+ ; wt littermate ) and six heterozygous ( gsk - 3beta +/ - ; gsk +/ - ) mice were homogenized and gsk - 3alpha and gsk - 3beta expression levels were examined by western blotting ( c ) .
gsk - 3beta ( d ) and gsk - 3 { lwoer case alpha } ( f ) expression levels were quantified with a computer - linked las - 3000 bio - imaging analyzer system .
although there were no significant differences in the gsk - 3alpha expression levels of wt and gsk +/ - mice ( n = 6 , p = 0.1797 , mann - whitney test ) , the gsk - 3beta expression levels of gsk +/ - mice were about 50 % of that of the wt littermates ( n = 6 , p = 0.0022 , mann - whitney test ) .
reduced gsk - 3beta activity in gsk +/ - mice was confirmed by incorporating radiolabeled 32p into gsk - 3 substrate peptide ( e ) ( n = 6 , p = 0.0022 , mann - whitney test ) .
results are expressed as means +/ - sem ; * , p < 0.05 ; ** , p < 0.01 ; *** , p < 0.001 .
the total amount ( c , e ) and relative activity ( f ) of gsk - 3beta in gsk +/ - mice were approximately 50 % and 70 % , respectively , of those in wt littermates .
the total amount and relative activity of gsk - 3alpha , a homologue of gsk - 3beta , in gsk +/ - mice were similar to those in wt mice ( c , d ) .
consistent with a previously report [ 20 ] , our gsk +/ - mice were healthy , fertile , and showed no changes in circadian rhythm , life span , motor control , and locomotor activity compared to wt mice ( see supporting information fig. s2 ) .
gsk +/ - mice , however , displayed reduced gsk - 3beta activity , without showing gsk - 3alpha compensation .

figure s2 basic characteristics ( circadian rhythm , locomotor activity , motor control activity , and life span ) of gsk +/ - mice .
gsk +/ - mice showed similar awake / rest patterns as wt littermate mice when housed under 12 - h light / dark conditions ( a ) .
after measuring the locomotor activity of three gsk +/ - and three wt mice for 3 successive days under home - cage conditions , we found that the total daily locomotor activity ( number of beam crossings ) of gsk +/ - mice during circadian monitoring did not significantly differ from that of wt littermate mice ( b ) .
motor control activity ( c ) was tested using an accelerated rotarod test ( 1.5 - 15 rpm / 3 min ) .
gsk +/ - and wt littermate mice did not show significant motor - skill differences ( mann - whitney test ) .
furthermore , gsk +/ - and wt littermate mice showed comparable survival times ( d ) ( log - rank test , p > 0.05 ) .

figure s3 path length ( a ) and latency ( b ) of wt and gsk +/ - mice in the mwm during 9 days of training .
during the first 3 days of training , both wt and gsk +/ - mice showed reduced latency to platform and shorter path - length to platform after repetitive training .
after longer , subsequent training , wt mice showed reduced latency to platform and shorter path - length to platform , but gsk +/ - mice did not .
this tendency is similarly reflected in the error score plot of fig. 1b .
because the error score is a value representing the cumulative distance a mouse travels to find the platform during each trial , the error score not only reflects a mouse 's path - length information during training but also it also reflects a mouse 's trace information until it reaches the platform .

figure s4 the emotional responses of gsk +/ - mice to the morris water maze were determined by assessing swim speed ( a ) and thigmotaxis tendency ( b ) .
in this analysis , we used only data obtained from the first training day to omit the influence of learning .
both emotional parameters indicated that no significant differences exist between gsk +/ - ( n = 19 ) and wt littermate ( n = 20 ) mice ( p > 0.05 , mann - whitney test ) .

figure s5 the effect of aging on place memory formation was investigated by comparing probe test scores ( percentage of stay time in the target quadrant ) after 9 days of training ( fig. 1e ) .
three age groups ( 7 - 9 months , 10 - 11 months , 12 - 14 months ) of wt and gsk +/ - mice were assessed .
although the relatively wide range of ages , 7 - 14 months , did not affect place memory formation ( two - way anova analysis ; aging factor , f = 0.4772,p = 14.86 ) , genotype , wt vs. gsk +/ - , did formation ( two - way anova analysis ; genotype factor , f = 6.020,p = 0.0196 ) .

figure s6 ar - a014418 inhibited tau phosphorylation , as shown in the western blots probed with tauc , a phosphorylation independent anti - tau antibody ; phf1 ( generously provided by dr. peter davies , albert einstein college of medicine , ny ) , a phosphorylation - dependent anti - tau antibody ; and tau1 ( chemicon , temecula , ca ) , a non - phosphorylation - dependent anti - tau antibody , which recognizes non - phosphorylated ser199 and ser202 .
ar - a014418 reduced tau phosphorylation ( phf1 immunoreactivity was reduced , tau1 immunoreactivity was increased , tauc immunoreactivity was unchanged ) to 70 % of that produced by vehicle injection alone , suggesting that peripheral treatment with a gsk - 3 inhibitor inhibited gsk - 3 activity by 30 % .

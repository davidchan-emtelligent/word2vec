to determine the role of toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( myd88 ) dependent pathway in the spinal cord secondary injury , compression injury was made at t8 segment of the spinal cord in adult male sprague - dawley rats .
shown by rt - pcr , tlr4 mrna in the spinal cord was quickly elevated after compression injury .
intramedullary injection of myd88 inhibitory peptide ( mip ) resulted in significant improvement in locomotor function recovery at various time points after surgery .
meanwhile , injury area , p38 phosphorylation , and proinflammation cytokines in the injured spinal cord were significantly reduced in mip - treated animals , compared with control peptide ( cp ) group .
these data suggest that tlrs myd88 - dependent pathway may play an important role in the development of secondary spinal cord injury , and inhibition of this pathway at early time after primary injury could effectively protect cells from inflammation and apoptosis and therefore improve the functional recovery .
1. introduction acute traumatic spinal cord injury ( sci ) is an unexpected , catastrophic event which causes various lifelong disabilities of the patients .
the consequences also result in grave influences in a row to family members and society .
however , there are no fully restorative therapies for sci up to now [ 1 - 3 ] .
the pathological sequelae following acute sci are divided into two phases : primary mechanical injury and secondary injury [ 4 - 6 ] .
primary sci is caused by direct mechanical trauma , and it instigates a progressive wave of secondary injury via activation of a series of pathophysiological mechanisms including alterations in microvascular perfusion , inflammation , lipid peroxidation , free radical generation , apoptotic / necrotic cell death , and dysregulation of ionic homeostasis [ 7 - 11 ] .
these mechanisms caused the destruction of axonal tracts that were left intact after the initial trauma , which is the major impediment to functional recovery after sci. it has been proved that fibers spared as few as 5 - 10 % in the spinal cord are sufficient to facilitate basic locomotion recovery following sci in rats [ 12 ] .
therefore , how to protect the spared fibers and reduce the secondary injury has become the top priority for scientists working in the research of sci. inflammatory responses are very important , even central , in the pathological process of the acute and chronic phases of secondary injury .
during the secondary injury phase , the central nervous system ( cns ) evokes both innate and adaptive immunities [ 11 , 13 ] .
after primary sci , resident microglia , invaded macrophages and dendritic cells could work as antigen presenting cells through toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) signaling [ 14 ] at and around the injury site .
at least 12 tlrs have been identified in the mammals , and they are involved in recognition of pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) and activation / regulation of both innate and adaptive immunities [ 15 , 16 ] .
moreover , it was recently shown that some tlrs ( e.g. , tlr2 , tlr4 ) can be stimulated by endogenous molecules named danger - associated molecular patterns ( damps ) [ 1 ] .
damps could be released from injury sites of the tissue [ 17 , 18 ] .
in sci , many damps including heat - shock proteins ( hsps ) , necrotic cells , fibronectin and hyaluronic acid , heparan sulphate , lung surfactant protein a , high - mobility group box 1 and mrna would be increased at sites of spinal injury , as accumulated studies reported [ 19 - 26 ] .
meanwhile , research with genetic deficient mice has indicated that tlr2 or tlr4 deficiency impaired function recovery in sci [ 27 ] , while research with tlr4 loss - of - function mutation mice showed that tlr4 deficiency protected against focal cerebral ischemia and axotomy - induced neruodegeneration [ 28 ] .
the signaling pathways activated by tlrs are broadly classified into myd88 - dependent and - independent pathways because myd88 is the universal adapter protein recruited by all tlrs except tlr3 [ 29 , 30 ] .
tlrs myd88 - dependent pathway activates nuclear - factor - kappab ( nf - kappab ) [ 31 ] and subsequently results in the production of inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. , tnf - alpha , il - 1beta ) [ 32 - 35 ] , while myd88 - independent pathway is related to transcriptional activation of type i interferons [ 36 - 38 ] and also activates late phase nf - kappab via tak which is shared by myd88 - dependent pathway .
however , the exact roles of these pathways in the pathophysiology of sci remain unclear .
nf - kappab is essential for neurons survival against oxidative stress and ischemic degeneration [ 39 ] , but it also contributes to inflammation and apoptosis after cns injury [ 40 , 41 ] .
the different phases of nf - kappab may serve distinct role in this balance .
therefore , we hypothesized that tlrs myd88 - dependent pathway correlated with the development of spinal cord secondary injury via inflammatory reaction .
in this study , at first we detected tlr4 mrna expression by rt - pcr in the spinal cord at several time points after compression sci , then used inhibitory peptide to block myd88 - dependent signaling at early time after sci , evaluated motor functional recovery by basso - beattie - bresnahan ( bbb ) score , beam - walking test , and foot print analysis , and investigated histological damage , cell apoptosis , and inflammatory reactions with immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) and western blotting assay .
we found that inhibition of myd88 - dependent pathway at early time could reduce the inflammatory response , preserve more neurons , reduce the lesion size in the spinal cord , and therefore promote motor functional recovery from spinal cord compression injury .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
animals and surgical procedure male sprague - dawley rats ( 200 - 220 g ) were purchased from experimental animal center of the fourth military medical university .
rats were housed in a 12 / 12 h light / dark cycle room with standard rodent food and water available ad libitum .
efforts were made to minimize animal discomfort and to sacrifice the fewest animals .
all experiments were done in accordance with the guidelines established by the animal care committee of fourth military medical university .
all the rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium ( 50 - 60 mg / kg ) , and then the back region was shaved and aseptically prepared with iodophor .
a laminectomy was performed at the t8 level to expose the cord underneath without disrupting the dura .
after the spinous processes of t7 and t9 were clamped to stabilize the spine , the exposed dorsal surface of the cord was subjected to compression as described before [ 42 ] .
briefly , a compression plate attached to a 20 g copper rod was used .
the compression plate was lowered down ventrally at a rate of 0.5 mm / min .
it reached the bottom 5 min later and was removed at a constant speed .
after compression injury , 24 rats were used for rt - pcr assay to detect tlr4 mrna expression at 0 h , 3 h , 24 h , 72 h , 7 d , and 14 d after injury .
another batch of rats was used for myd88 blockade observation ( table 1 ) .
locomotor functions were evaluated , and histological analyses were performed on this batch of animals .
2.2 .
reverse transcription pcr ( rt - pcr ) for tlr4 tlr4 mrna levels after sci were detected by using rt - pcr .
after compression sci as previously described , rats were anesthetized and sacrificed at 0 h , 3 h , 24 h , 72 h , 7 d , and 14 d after compression injury ( for every time point , n = 4 ) .
total rna was isolated from 10 mm of thoracic spinal cord tissue centered at the injury site .
rna was purified using the trizol reagent according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
in order to remove any traces of contaminating dna , rna samples were treated using the rnase - free dnase i ( takara , co. , ltd. dalian , china ) .
one microgram of total rna was reverse transcribed into first strand cdna in each 20 mul reaction mixture , according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( takara , co. , ltd. dalian , china ) .
primers used were as follows : tlr4 , sense : 5 ' - gttggattttacgaattccacct - 3 ' , and antisense : 5 ' - tgcttcttgttcttcctctgatg - 3 ' ; the expected size was 646 bp ; beta - actin , sense : 5 ' - gagagggaaatcgtgcgtgac - 3 ' , and antisense : 5 ' - catctgctggaaggtggaca - 3 ' ; and the expected size was 453 bp. pcr was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the pcr mixture ( 20 mul ) contained 10 mumol of each primer , 200 mum dntps , 25 mm mgcl2 , 2 mul 10x pcr buffer , 1 u taq dna polymerase ( takara , co. , ltd. dalian , china ) , and 10 mum purified cdna .
denaturing , annealing and extension times were 30 seconds each , at 95 , 57 , and 72degreesc , respectively .
cdna samples were amplified for 40 cycles .
the specific product was separated on a 2 % agarose gel ( biowest , spain ) and detected after staining with ethidium bromide under uv illumination .
2.3 .
myd88 blockade experiments after compression injury as described previously , rats were randomly divided into two groups : mip group and cp group .
each rat of mip group received intramedullary injection of 5 mul myd88 inhibitor peptide ( mip , 100 mumol / l , imgenex , usa ) , and each rat of cp group was given 5 mul control peptide ( cp , 100 mumol / l , imgenex , usa ) , dissolved in 0.01 mol / l pbs , immediately after compression injury at the injury site .
the peptides we used for inhibition and control contain a protein transduction ( ptd ) sequence ( drqikiwfqnrrmkwkk ) derived from antennapedia , and the cp consists of only the ptd sequence , which renders the peptide cell permeability .
the injections were done at both sides of the dorsal vein at a constant rate of 1 mul / min at about 1 mm below the spinal cord surface .
then the muscles and skin were closed in layers , and every two rats were placed in one cage .
manual bladder expression was performed at least twice per day until reflex bladder emptying was established .
2.3.1 .
histological analysis animals were perfused via the left cardio - ventricle with 100 ml of physiological saline and subsequently with 400 ml of 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer ( pb , ph = 7.4 ) at 7 d and 14 d , respectively ( n = 5 ) .
three centimeters spinal cord was carefully dissected out with the injury site in the center and was immersed in 25 % sucrose solution for 24 - 48 h at 4degreesc until it sank .
sagittal sections were cut at 20 mum in thickness with a cryostat and thawed - mounted onto gelatinized slides .
the sections were kept at - 20degreesc until used .
for haematoxylin & eosin ( h & e ) staining , sections were washed briefly in distilled water , stained in haematoxylin solution for 5 min .
after this , sections were washed in running tap water for 5 min and differentiated in 1 % acid alcohol for 30 sec .
then sections were washed in tap water for 1 min , placed in eosin for 30 sec , dehydrated through 70 % , 80 % , 90 % , and 100 % alcohol 2 min each , clear in 2 changes of xylene , 5 min each , and mounted with xylene - based mounting medium .
for ihc staining , the sections were rinsed in pbs 3 times 5 min and blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin for 1 h to eliminate nonspecific staining and then incubated with primary antibodies 16 - 24 h at room temperature .
primary antibodies were rabbit anti - cleaved caspase - 3 ( 1 : 400 , cell signaling technology , usa ) , rabbit anti - gfap ( 1 : 4000 , sigma , usa ) , mouse anti - neun ( 1 : 500 , sigma , usa ) , and goat anti - igg ( 1 : 400 , millipore , usa ) .
then sections were rinsed with pbs 3 times , 5 min for each time , and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature .
sections were examined on olympus bx 51 microscope ( olympus , japan ) or fv 1000 confocal microscope ( olympus , japan ) .
for cell counting , five sections were chosen for analysis in each rat , namely , the section with central canal and two adjacent sections on both sides .
after pictures were taken , images were opened in adobe photoshop 9.0 and stuck together as a montage .
caspase - 3 - positive cells ( with nucleus indicated by hoechest staining ) were counted from 4 represented areas randomly chosen in the sections .
neun - positive cells within the first and second 1000 mum distance to the lesion border were counted .
the mean values of the five sections in each rat were used for statistical analysis .
for lesion area measurement , gfap staining images were taken as mentioned previously .
the boundary of the injured area was outlined according to the differences between normal tissue and necrotic tissue or cavity .
the pixels of the outlined area were calculated and then converted into the size of injury by using adobe photoshop 9.0 software .
2.3.2 .
western blot assay at 7 d after compression sci , animals were deeply anesthetized and sacrificed ( n = 5 ) .
one - centimeter long spinal cord tissues , 5 mm rostral and 5 mm cordal to the injury site , were removed rapidly and stored in liquid nitrogen and then processed for extraction of protein .
briefly , tissue samples were homogenized with 0.5 ml of ice - cold lysis buffer ( 20 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.5 , 1 mm edta , 5 mm mgcl2 , 1 mm dtt , 20 mug / ml aprotinin , 1 mm pmsf , and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate ) .
the homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4degreesc and supernatant were removed .
the protein concentration was determined using bradford method , a detergent - compatible protein assay with a bovine serum albumin as standard .
samples were boiled at 100degreesc for 10 min and then were electrophoresed on 10 - 15 % sds - page and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane ( millipore , bedford , ma , usa ) .
the filter membranes were blocked with 5 % nonfat milk for 1.5 h at room temperature and incubated with the primary antibody ( phospho - p38 mapk 1 : 1000 , cell signaling technology , ma , usa ; caspase - 3 , 1 : 1000 , cell signaling technology , ma , usa ; tnf - alpha 1 : 500 , santa , ca , usa ; il - 1beta , 1 : 1000 , gifted by professor beifen shen , department of molecular immunology , beijing , china ) 16 - 24 h at 4degreesc .
then the membrane was washed with tbst buffer and incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( 1 : 8000 ; jackson immunoresearch , usa ) for 1 h at room temperature and visualized in ecl solution .
the density of specific bands was measured with image j ( nih , usa ) software .
2.3.3 .
bbb score bbb scales were used to detect the recovery of the motor function every day from 0 d to 14 d after injury .
each rat was placed in an 80 x 130 x 30 cm open field and run for 4 minutes and scaled from 0 to 21 point according to the guidelines [ 43 ] .
2.3.4 .
beam - walking tests beam - walking tests were used to detect the distance from the rump to the plane to reflect the recovery of the motor function at 7 d and 14 d after injury .
the apparatus used for behavioral analysis beam is 120 cm long and 12 cm wide and supported by a 70 cm framework .
we set up a video camera and recorded the animal 's behavior walking from one end to the other end of the beam .
then we did video frame extraction and selected 5 represented frames to measure rump height by using image tool 2.0 ( uthscsa ) software .
2.3.5 .
footprint analysis footprint analysis was conducted at 7 d and 14 d after injury .
a piece of white paper ( 15 x 89 cm2 ) was put on the track and both of the hindlimbs plantar surfaces were colored blue and dorsal surfaces red [ 44 ] .
then the rats were allowed to walk from one end of the track to the other end .
when foot dorsal surface touched the track , the white paper would be printed with red color , while when foot plantar touched the track , blue color would be left on the white paper .
then the whole paper with prints was scanned for analysis .
using adobe photoshop 9.0 software , the percentage of red pixels defined as red /( blue + red ) x 100 % was calculated to reflect the condition of toe dragging .
stride length ( distance between the centers of ipsilateral adjacent footprints ) and stride width ( perpendicular distance between the centers of left and right hind limbs ) were measured , and the average of five steps in each case was used for statistical comparison .
because only when injured rats walk well with plantar step , stride length and width could be clear enough to be measured , these parameters were taken only at 14 d after injury .
2.4 .
statistical analysis all data were presented as mean +/ - standard deviation .
the statistical significance of differences between groups was determined by one - way anova followed by tukey test .
the statistical program originpro 7.0 for windows was used for statistic analysis .
significant levels were set at p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 .
3. results 3.1 .
expression of tlr4 mrna after compression sci rna extracted from spinal cord tissue after sci at different times revealed time - related changes of tlr4 mrna expression.tlr4 mrna were dramatically increased at 24 h after sci , with peak expression evident by 72 h after injury , and it was lowered to normal level at 14 d after injury ( figure 1 ) .
3.2 .
injury area of primary injury he staining showed that there was no significant difference in injury area immediately after compression injury between the two groups .
in cp group , injury area was 0.8127 +/ - 0.05905 mm2 , and in mip group , it was 0.8206 +/ - 0.07541 mm2 ( figure 2 ( c ) , p = 0.88723 ) .
3.3 .
inflammatory cytokines and p38 mapk activation western blot assay showed that inflammatory factors were reduced by mip treatment at 7d after compression injury in the spinal cord .
in mip group , tnf - alpha was dramatically decreased , compared with that in cp group ( figure 3 ( a ) , p < 0.05 ). and il - 1beta in cp group was about twofolds of that in mip group ( figure 3 ( b ) , p < 0.05 ) .
phospho - p38 mapk , which is associated with tlrs myd88 - dependent pathway , was also reduced after given mip ( figure 3 ( c ) , p < 0.05 ) .
3.4 .
cell apoptosis and injury areas western blot analysis was also performed to detect total caspase - 3 ( figure 4 ( a )) , a marker for the apoptosis .
the result showed that in mip group caspase - 3 was dramatically decreased , compared with which in cp group ( figure 4 ( b )) .
to confirm the result , caspase - 3 ihc was done on the spinal cord sections at 7 d after surgery ( figures 4 ( c ) and 4 ( d )) .
cell counting showed by randomly choosing 4 represented areas that the number of caspase - 3 positive cells was significantly decreased in mip group ( 139.1 +/ - 29.8 ) compared with that in cp group ( 192.0 +/ - 41.0 ) ( figure 4 ( e )) .
five sections of each group were used to do the neun ihc staining to detect the number of preserved neurons at 7 d and 14 d after injury , pictured by olympus bx51 ( figure 5 ) .
neun - positive cells in 2000 mum beside injury area at the two end stumps were counted .
at 7 d after injury , the result showed that there were more preserved neurons in mip group in the first ( 234.8 +/ - 49.2 ) and second ( 343.0 +/ - 60.3 ) 1,000 mum compared with cp group 191.6 +/ - 47.3 and 244.4 +/ - 84.2 respectively ( p < 0.05 ) .
at 14 d after injury , the results showed that mip group had more neurons ( 296.9 +/ - 64.8 ) than that of cp group ( 224.8 +/ - 17.9 ) in the first 1,000 mum area ( figures 5 ( a1 , b1 , a1 , b1 ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
while in the next 1,000 mum area , there was no significant difference between the two groups ( figure 5 ( a2 , b2 , a2 , b2 ) ( p = 0.77719 ) .
we used gfap , a marker of the astrocyte , to show the injury area at 7 d and 14 d ( figure 6 ( a ) and 6 ( b )) after injury .
statistics ( figure 6 ( c )) showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups in size of the lesion area .
mip group got a smaller injury area at 7 d ( 1.9 +/ - 0.6 mm2 ) and 14 d ( 1.4 +/ - 0.5 mm2 ) compared with that of cp group 3.4 +/ - 1.3 mm2 ( p < 0.05 ) 2.8 +/ - 0.6 mm2 ( p < 0.01 ) , respectively .
3.5 .
locomotor recovery during the whole process , three tests including bbb score , beam - walking test , and footprint analysis were performed to compare the recovery of the motor function in different treatments after sci. 3.5.1 .
bbb score bbb test was performed every day after injury .
results ( figure 7 ) showed that there was no difference in the first 3 days , while at the 4 d after injury , the rats in mip group had better hindlimbs motor function recovery than those in cp group .
at 7 d , rats in mip group got an average score of 15.2 +/ - 4.6 , which meant that those rats could support their body weight by the hindlimbs and sometimes walk coordinately .
while cp group scored 6.3 +/ - 0.5 , which meant that the rats could only move two or three joints of the hindlimbs extensively .
at 14 d , rats in mip group got an average score of 20.0 +/ - 1.0 , which meant that the rats walked coordinately with tail consistently up and had no toe dragging .
in cp group rats scored 14.5 +/ - 1.3 ( p < 0.05 ) , which meant the rats could support its weight by the hindlimbs and walk coordinately with the tail down at this time .
3.5.2 .
beam - walking test beam - walking test was done to detect the rump height which means the vertical distance from base end of the rat tail to the surface of the beam .
this distance reflects the ability of the rat hindlimbs to support its body weight .
at 7 d and 14 d after injury there were significant differences in rump height between the two groups ( figure 8 ) .
the height was 12.0 +/ - 4.7 mm in mip group and 4.6 +/ - 1.2 mm in cp group at 7 d ( p < 0.05 ) .
at 14 d after injury , the height was 14.2 +/ - 4.3 mm in mip group and 7.7 +/ - 3.5 mm in cp group ( p < 0.05 ) .
3.5.3 .
footprint analysis three parameters including hindlimbs stride length , stride width , and the ratio of toe dragging were taken from the footprint analysis ( figure 9 ( a )) .
these measurements imply the gait recovery of the rats from sci. figure 9 ( b ) showed that at 7 d after injury , the percentage of red color pixels in mip group was 25.8 +/ - 22.8 % , and in cp group it was 86.4 +/ - 7.3 % ( p < 0.01 ) ; at 14 d , the percentage was 10.2 +/ - 14.3 % in mip group and 48.8 +/ - 11.3 % in cp group ( p < 0.05 ) .
stride length and width ( figure 9 ( c )) measured at 14 d after injury indicated significant differences between mip and cp treatments .
compared with cp group , mip group had a bigger stride length ( 143.7 +/ - 13.3 mm ) and smaller stride width ( 38.1 +/ - 3.9 mm ) than that of cp group ( 105.7 +/ - 11.5 mm , 68.1 +/ - 10.3 mm ; p < 0.05 ) .
4. discussion although whether endogenous ligands really trigger tlrs signals without pathogen is debatable [ 45 ] , many studies have documented that tlrs responded to the host antigens as well as bacteria [ 32 , 46 , 47 ] .
these damps combine to tlrs to induce myd88 - dependent pathway to produce proinflammatory cytokines [ 15 , 16 , 22 , 48 ] .
our previous study in vitro also showed homologous igg induced microglia tlr4 expression and the tnf - alpha production upregulated [ 49 ] .
in the injured area of the spinal cord , the blood - spinal cord barrier was destroyed by the primary injury , serum proteins were extravasated easily into the parenchyma of the spinal cord , as indicated by the igg immunoreactivity , tissue disruption would produce sufficient debris , and injury may lead heat shock protein release from damaged neurons and serve as damp as well , all of which may activate tlrs signaling .
in the present study , pathogen infection may not be excluded but was minimized by keeping dura intact and sterile manipulation .
there was great amount of cell debris caused by compression in the local spinal cord , and serum proteins could easily enter to spinal parenchyma since the local blood - spinal barrier was seriously damaged .
all these debris and serum proteins could serve as damp to bind and activate tlrs in microglia and other cells around the wound .
as one of the well - studied tlrs that could be triggered by endogenous damp , tlr4 has been documented to be involved in a vicious cycle which mediates neurodegeneration [ 50 ] .
the other tlrs might also play roles in spinal cord injury - induced innate immune reactivities ; nevertheless alteration of tlr4 expression may reflect tlrs responses to damp in the present study .
in our experiment , tlr4 mrna was upregulated 3 h after compression injury , peaked between 24 h and 72 h after injury , and then came back to the baseline at 14 d ( figure 1 ) , according to rt - pcr detection .
these data indicated that tlr4 responded to the sci quickly , and its expression was increased at early period post injury. with this sterile sci compression model , we also revealed by immunofluorescent staining that tlr4 protein was mainly expressed in microglial cells in the injured area of spinal cord ( data not shown ) , indicating that the immune response associated with tlr4 in the early stage was born by microglial cells , which was the same result as kigerl et al. reported [ 27 ] .
according to the report , most tlrs were expressed twofolds more than sham injury controls as early as one day after spinal cord injury .
then two pathways of tlrs signaling would be activated as the damp combined with them .
at early phase of tlrs activation , myd88 - dependent pathway may exert its inflammatory role dominantly via nf - kappab [ 31 , 34 ] .
after tlrs myd88 - dependent pathway was activated , it will mediate the expression of proinflammatory genes and leukocyte recruitment after cns injury [ 51 ] .
the present study obtained the similar results from the compression sci in the rats .
sci caused il - 1beta and tnf - alpha protein increased in the spinal cord tissue , as shown by western blotting assay .
myd88 is a common molecule shared by most tlrs ( except tlr3 ) to activate nf - kappab , resulting in the production of large amounts of cytokines , including il - 1 and tnf - alpha [ 52 , 53 ] .
the levels of il - 1beta increase rapidly after traumatic sci [ 54 - 56 ] .
tnf - alpha expression at both mrna and protein levels is also an immediate event after sci [ 57 , 58 ] .
tnf - alpha has been regarded as a key inflammatory regulator that can induce further cytokine production , inflammation , gliosis , demyelination , blood - brain - barrier damage , and cell adhesion [ 59 ] .
sharma et al. reported that tnf - alpha antiserum could alleviate the microvascular permeability disturbances , cell damage , and edema in the spinal cord trauma in the rat [ 60 ] .
nesic et al. reported that given il - 1 receptor antagonist at the site of injury could dramatically reduce the contusion - induced apoptosis and caspase - 3 activity in the model of contused spinal cord injury [ 61 ] .
in the context of proinflammatory cytokines production , cell apoptosis developed in the adjacent area to the injury site , indicated by caspase - 3 elevation in the present study .
these findings are identical to the previous report by pais et al .
[ 62 ] who demonstrated in vitro that necrotic neurons could activate cultured microglia to produce proinflammatory cytokines and thus induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons .
therefore , inflammation at the early stage exacerbates the disruption at the injured tissue by enhancement of cell lost .
here we documented that traumatic injury to the spinal cord itself leads to the early inflammation by triggering tlrs myd88 - dependent pathway .
the peptides we used for inhibition and control contain a protein transduction ( ptd ) sequence ( drqikiwfqnrrmkwkk ) derived from antennapedia , and the cp consists of only the ptd sequence , which renders the peptide cell permeability .
in the present study , these peptides were given immediately after the compression injury was performed .
although the effective duration of the mip was not determined in our study , it may start approximately 24 h after administration as in vitro study mip need , to be incubated with cells 24 h ahead of intervention .
the blockade period could be partially overlapped with the main part of the upregulated tlr4 expression period indicated by rt - pcr data ( figure 1 ) , especially to the early stage of the tlr4 myd88 signals .
in our experiment , inhibition of myd88 - dependent pathway with mip significantly lowered the levels of tnf - alpha and il - 1beta , and mip treatment also inhibited the p38 mapk activation in the injured spinal cord .
namely , blockade of myd88 signal inhibited nf - kappab pathway and therefore downregulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the spinal tissue .
meanwhile , cell apoptosis was reduced significantly by mip treatment , indicated by caspase - 3 expression .
cell counting for neun - positive cells also formed that more neurons survived in the mip - treated group after sci. these data are consistent with previous report by liebermann and hoffman that myd88 mediates negative growth control , including growth suppression and apoptosis [ 63 ] .
amelioration of apoptosis resulted in more cells survival ; at least more neurons were conserved , according to the neun - positive cell counting in the present study .
as it well known , spared axons are pivotal for the functional recovery ; more neurons survival means that more axons in the spinal cord are spared thus to enhance the function recovery .
the behavioral tests indicated clearly the improvement of locomotor recovery in the rats treated with mip , compared with the cp - treated group .
the obvious improvement was seen from the 4th day after sci till the end of our observation ( 14 d post injury ) .
these data imply the protective effect of blockade of myd88 - dependent signaling pathway at early time in our experimental system .
we also found injury area smaller in the mip group than that in the control group .
these findings imply that lowered inflammation could preserve more cells including neurons and thus may contribute to less secondary injury and better behavioral function after sci. therefore , it would be protective to block tlrs myd88 - dependent pathway which maybe play an important role in the development of secondary spinal cord injury .
proinflammatory factors of production cells may have totally reverse action depending on when the cells were activated and where they migrated [ 14 ] .
activated microglial cells can secret lots of products that have harmful effects on adjacent neurons , while it can also produce some beneficial factors such as bdnf , nt - 3 , and tgf - beta [ 64 - 67 ] .
however , some of these neurotrophic factors have been shown to induce apoptosis of oligodendrocytes or neurons , sometimes during developmental regulation of neuronal proliferation , sometimes in the injured adult organism [ 68 ] .
up to now , the question of two - edge sword is unsolved .
it is generally accepted that suppression or inhibition of cns macrophages at the early time is neuroprotective after sci [ 69 - 73 ] , though some authors hold that macrophages are beneficial to the recovery of sci due to their anti - inflammation role [ 74 , 75 ] .
the latter point of view maybe result from the reduced accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines , neurotoxins , and proteases , all of which can be released by cns macrophages [ 76 - 78 ] .
since the inflammation could be triggered by tissue disruption via tlrs activated by endogenous damps , roles of tlrs in sci have been studied extensively with many technologies .
using genetic knockout mice , studies showed the alteration in the cns repair caused by tlr2 , tlr4 deficiency [ 27 ] , which is convinced and complete .
however , to some extent , it is different with our results .
the reasons may lie in discrepancy of animal models , detailed experimental systems , and the time window of proinflammatory factors that affect the sci process .
therefore , specific antagonist / inhibitor of myd88 - dependent pathway at specific phase only may target the harmful effects , protect the spared tissue after sci regardless of the cell types , and promote the recovery through inhibition of inflammation and cell apoptosis .
it is interesting that stimulated astrocytes with tlrs ligands could inhibit their ability to uptake excess glutamate [ 79 , 80 ] .
as it is well known , sci leads to the release of massive of glutamate [ 81 ]. and excitotoxicity of glutamate was widely studied and showed significant involvement in secondary damage [ 81 ] .
in 1999 , vezzani et al. reported that glutamate could induce il - 1 synthesis [ 82 ] .
these studies suggest that tlrs may be associated with not only inflammation but also many other mechanisms involved in spinal cord secondary injury .
in conclusion , the present study showed with rat compression sci models that traumatic injury that caused tissue damages may trigger tlrs signals , and tlrs myd88 - dependent pathway may play crucial roles in the secondary injury .
inhibition of the tlrs myd88 - dependent pathway at early time after spinal cord injury could protect the spinal cord from inflammation and apoptosis and promote the functional recovery .

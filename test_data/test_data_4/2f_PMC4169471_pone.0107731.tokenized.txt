transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that alters cortical excitability .
interestingly , in recent animal studies facilitatory effects of tdcs have also been observed on subcortical structures .
here , we sought to provide evidence for the potential of tdcs to facilitate subcortical structures in humans as well .
subjects received anodal - tdcs and sham - tdcs on two separate testing days in a counterbalanced order .
after stimulation , we assessed the effect of tdcs on two responses that arise from subcortical structures ; ( 1 ) wrist and ankle responses to an imperative stimulus combined with a startling acoustic stimulus ( sas ) , and ( 2 ) automatic postural responses to external balance perturbations with and without a concurrent sas .
during all tasks , response onsets were significantly faster following anodal - tdcs compared to sham - tdcs , both in trials with and without a sas .
the effect of tdcs was similar for the dominant and non - dominant leg .
the sas accelerated the onsets of ankle and wrist movements and the responses to backward , but not forward perturbations .
the faster onsets of sas - induced wrist and ankle movements and automatic postural responses following stimulation provide strong evidence that , in humans , subcortical structures - in particular the reticular formation - can be facilitated by tdcs .
this effect may be explained by two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive .
first , subcortical facilitation may have resulted from enhanced cortico - reticular drive .
second , the applied current may have directly stimulated the reticular formation .
strengthening reticulospinal output by tdcs may be of interest to neurorehabilitation , as there is evidence for reticulospinal compensation after corticospinal lesions .

introduction transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that alters cortical excitability via application of a weak direct current .
the proposed neuronal mechanism underlying the observed facilitatory or inhibitory effects on cortical output involves slight shifts in the resting membrane potential of cortical neurons [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
in humans , facilitation of cortical areas by means of anodal tdcs has been found to improve several motor and cognitive functions [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , which has sparked a wealth of research on its utility in patients with central injuries .
interestingly , a recent study in anaesthetized cats showed that tdcs not only affects cortical excitability , but also facilitates subcortical neurons [ 6 ] .
rubrospinal and reticulospinal neurons were facilitated by anodal tdcs over the sensorimotor cortex , resulting in shortened latencies and / or increased amplitudes of descending volleys .
such remote effects of tdcs may greatly expand its potential utility in patients with central injuries , but whether tdcs can also facilitate subcortical structures in humans is yet unknown .
an imaging study has suggested that subcortical facilitation by tdcs may indeed be possible in humans [ 7 ] , but direct evidence is lacking .
in this study , we sought to provide evidence for the potential of tdcs to facilitate subcortical structures in humans .
we established the effect of tdcs in healthy human subjects on responses that originate from subcortical structures .
first , we examined wrist and ankle responses to an imperative ' go ' signal , both with and without simultaneous presentation of a startling acoustic stimulus ( sas ) .
a sas accelerates the onset latencies of movement responses [ 8 ] , which has been termed ' startreact effect ' .
the shortened onset latencies reflect a direct subcortical release of motor programs [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] .
second , we examined automatic postural responses to external balance perturbations , with and without a concurrent sas .
these initial postural responses , both with and without a sas , also arise from subcortical structures [ 12 ] .
materials and methods participants ten healthy adults ( 4 women , mean 22 years , range 18 - 27 ) participated in this study .
nine participants were right - handed as verified by the edinburgh handedness inventory [ 13 ] .
these nine participants also showed dominance of the right leg , as identified by the question ' with which foot would you kick a soccer ball ' ?
none of the participants suffered from hearing , neurological or motor disorders that could interfere with performance during the experiments .
the study was approved by the local medical ethics committee ( cmo region arnhem / nijmegen ) and was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
all subjects gave their written informed consent prior to the experiment .
experimental setup and protocol participants were measured on two different measurement sessions ( separated by at least one week ) in which they first received ' anodal - tdcs' or ' sham - tdcs ' .
the order of the stimulation type was counterbalanced across subjects .
following stimulation , simple reaction times ( wrist flexion and ankle dorsiflexion ) and onset latencies of postural responses were evaluated .
the order of the tasks was also counterbalanced across subjects .
we designed our protocol such that the assessments could be completed within 30 minutes after stimulation because of the time - limited effect of tdcs [ 4 ] .
due to these time limitations , we chose to assess wrist flexion unilaterally ( ipsilateral to the hemisphere receiving anodal stimulation ) , in light of the evidence that arm flexors predominantly receive ipsilateral reticulospinal projections [ 14 ] .
ankle dorsiflexion was assessed bilaterally , as it is yet unknown whether reticulospinal projections to the dorsiflexor muscles are predominantly ipsilateral or contralateral .
tdcs tdcs was applied by a battery - driven constant - current stimulator ( dc - stimulator plus , neuroconn , illmenau , germany ) via conductive - rubber electrodes , placed in two saline - soaked sponges ( 5x7 cm ) .
the anodal electrode was placed over the non - dominant motor region ( c3 / c4 on the 10 - 20 international electroencephalogram system ) .
the reference electrode was placed over the contralateral supraorbital region .
we stimulated the non - dominant motor region , as we evaluated wrist flexion in the dominant arm , with the arm flexors receiving dominant ipsilateral cortico - reticular projections [ 14 ] .
during anodal stimulation , tdcs was applied for 15 minutes at an intensity of 2 ma. the current was ramped up to its target intensity over 10 seconds and ramped down in the same time interval at the end of the stimulation period .
during sham stimulation , the same procedure was followed but current was applied for 15 seconds only after the first ramp period , followed by 10 seconds ramp down .
stimulation was applied in standing position .
two participants were able to differentiate between the sham and anodal condition , whereas the remaining eight participants could not indicate which session involved anodal - tdcs .
simple reaction time task participants sat in a chair with their hip , knee and ankle joints in 90 degrees .
the chair was positioned 2.5 meters in front of two arrays of light - emitting diodes ( leds ; 11x8 cm , 3 cm apart ) .
illumination of the first led array formed a warning signal .
we instructed participants to respond as rapidly as possible to illumination of the second led array ( i.e. , imperative stimulus ) in three separate movement tasks ; 1 ) dorsiflexion of the dominant or 2 ) non - dominant ankle , or 3 ) flexion of the dominant wrist .
the order of the conditions was counterbalanced across subjects .
warning periods ( 1 - 3.5 seconds ) and inter - trial periods ( 6 - 10 seconds ) were variable .
in each condition , participants performed 16 trials .
in 25 % of trials a startling acoustic stimulus ( sas ) was given simultaneously with the imperative stimulus .
the sas was given through binaural earphones and consisted of 50 ms white noise with an intensity of 116 db ( sound pressure level ) , and was generated by a custom - made noise generator .
for the condition involving wrist flexion , the participant 's arm was secured in a semi - prone position with the palm facing inward to a custom - made wrist manipulandum that moved in the transverse plane with an axis of rotation at the wrist joint [ 11 ] , [ 15 ] .
automatic postural responses participants stood on a moveable platform that could suddenly and unexpectedly translate in the forward or backward direction [ 16 ] .
a forward translation of the platform resulted in a backward balance perturbation and vice versa .
in the remainder of this text , we will refer to the direction of the balance perturbation .
platform movements comprised an acceleration phase ( 300 ms ) , a constant - velocity phase ( 500 ms ) and a deceleration phase ( 300 ms ) .
both forward and backward perturbations were delivered by platform acceleration of 0.75 m / s2 .
participants received 16 forward and 16 backward balance perturbations in a random order .
in 25 % of both forward and backward trials , the perturbation was combined with a sas that was administered through binaural earphones at the start of the platform movement .
consecutive trials were separated by at least 20 seconds .
on both testing days , subjects received four practice trials before tdcs ( two for each direction ) .
participants were instructed to sustain the perturbations without taking a step or grabbing the handrails surrounding the platform for support .
data collection muscle activity was measured using surface electromyography ( emg ) data from bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medialis muscles and from the dominant flexor carpi radials muscle ( zerowire by aurion , italy ; 2000 hz ) .
self - adhesive ag - agcl electrodes ( tyco arbo ecg ) were placed approximately 2 cm apart and longitudinally on the belly of each muscle , according to seniam guidelines [ 17 ] .
emg signals were sampled at 2000 hz and full - wave rectified and low - pass filtered at 30 hz ( zero - lag , second order butterworth filter ) .
furthermore , to assess movement onset , a triaxial accelerometer was placed at the foot or hand involved in the simple reaction task .
accelerometer signals were sampled at 2000 hz. data analysis simple reaction time task two reaction time parameters were assessed : emg reaction time and accelerometer reaction time .
for each condition , we calculated ensemble average emg and accelerometer traces , separately for trials with and without a sas .
onset latencies of the muscles of interest were determined using a semi - automatic computer algorithm that selected the first instant at which the mean emg activity exceeded a threshold of 2 standard deviations ( sd ) above the mean background activity , as calculated over a 500 ms period just prior to the imperative ' go ' signal .
onsets were first selected by the computer algorithm , then visually approved and ( when necessary ) corrected [ 18 ] .
average onset latencies were calculated separately for trials with and without a sas .
the onset of foot and wrist acceleration was determined in the same manner .
automatic postural responses we determined the latencies of the prime movers of the postural responses using the algorithm described above .
for forward perturbations , we identified the onset latencies in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle ; for backward perturbations , we determined the onset latencies in the tibialis anterior muscle .
statistical analysis ankle dorsiflexion reaction times and latencies of automatic postural responses were evaluated using a repeated measures anova , with sas ( sas - no sas ) , tdcs ( anodal - tdcs - sham - tdcs ) and leg ( dominant - non - dominant ) as within subjects factors .
wrist flexion reaction times were evaluated using sas and tdcs as within subjects factors .
main effects are reported as well as sas x tdcs effects .
other interaction effects are only reported if significant .
the alpha level was set at 0.05 .

discussion in this study we aimed to establish whether transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ) is able to facilitate subcortical motor responses in humans .
we examined the effects of anodal tdcs over the non - dominant motor region on two types of motor responses that originate from subcortical structures , 1 ) sas - induced wrist flexion and ankle dorsiflexion movements , and 2 ) postural responses to forward and backward perturbations , with and without a concurring sas .
in all tasks , responses were significantly shorter after anodal - tdcs compared to sham - tdcs , both in trials with and without a sas .
for ankle dorsiflexion as well as postural responses , the effect of tdcs did not differ between the dominant and non - dominant leg .
these results support the hypothesis that tdcs facilitates not only cortical , but also subcortical structures .
subcortical origin of startreact and postural responses for the interpretation of our results , it is important to highlight the evidence for the subcortical origin of the responses studied .
the origin of sas - induced responses is a matter of an ongoing debate , but a recent study provided strong evidence that subcortical structures , in particular the reticular formation , play a key role in the startreact effect [ 11 ] .
three hypothesis have been proposed to explain the startreact effect .
the first and prevailing hypothesis is a direct release of a subcortically stored motor program by the sas [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , conveyed by the reticulospinal tract [ 10 ] , [ 19 ] .
the second hypothesis proposes that the sas could act as a subcortically mediated trigger for a cortically stored motor program , conveyed by the corticospinal tract [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
this second hypothesis is supported by the observation that the acceleration of motor responses by a sas can be delayed by transcranial magnetic stimulation ( tms ) over the motor cortex [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
moreover , a recent study using eeg highlighted the role of cortical pre - motor areas in the preparation of sas - induced movements [ 23 ] .
third , a sas could act as an additional stimulus on top of the imperative stimulus , thereby increasing the energy of the sensory input , a process known as intersensory facilitation [ 24 ] .
intersensory facilitation could subsequently lead to faster sensorimotor coupling at cortical level , resulting in accelerated release of motor programs conveyed by the corticospinal tract .
importantly , sas - induced responses are likely dissociated from startle reflexes as startreact is often observed in the absence of standard markers of startle reflexes [ 25 ] - [ 30 ] .
in a recent study we tried to unravel the hypotheses described above by applying the startreact paradigm to patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia ( hsp ) [ 11 ] .
hsp is a disease characterized by retrograde axonal degeneration of the corticospinal tract , while leaving the reticulospinal tract unaffected [ 31 ] .
typically , hsp in its pure form does not affect the corticospinal tracts innervating the motoneurons of the upper extremities .
in our study , we compared the startreact effect between a reaction task involving ankle dorsiflexion and a task involving wrist flexion [ 11 ] .
simple reaction times of ankle dorsiflexion were delayed in the patients with hsp compared to healthy controls , which coincided with delayed motor evoked potentials in tibialis anterior in response to supramaximal tms .
when the ankle dorsiflexion task was combined with a sas , however , reaction times in the patients were accelerated to a larger extent than in the controls , resulting in completely normalized emg and movement onset latencies .
when the reaction time task involved voluntary wrist flexion instead of ankle dorsiflexion , no differences in onset latencies between patients and controls were recorded , irrespective of whether a sas was applied .
this pattern of results provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that a sas accelerates reaction times by releasing a subcortically stored motor program conveyed by the reticulospinal tract .
one might argue that our study in patients with hsp provided evidence for subcortical pathways mediating sas - induced ankle dorsiflexion responses , but that there is no direct evidence for sas - induced wrist flexion responses originating from these structures .
yet , in people with hemiparetic stroke , a similar preservation of sas - induced acceleration of onset latencies in the upper extremity has been demonstrated [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , which suggests that these responses are also conveyed by fast subcortical pathways .
moreover , in healthy humans , startreact responses in the upper and lower extremities exhibit the same characteristics , since they leave the muscle activation pattern unaffected and show the same degree of sas - induced acceleration [ 8 ] .
hence , the mechanism underlying startreact effects in the upper and lower extremities is likely the same .
there is strong evidence that , in line with startreact responses , the reticular formation plays a key role in postural responses as well .
in the present study , we investigated medium latency ( automatic ) postural responses that are mediated by group ii or group ib afferents .
these responses have convincingly been shown not to involve transcortical pathways [ 12 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
animal studies have demonstrated that , instead , they are likely encoded by neurons in the reticular formation , which synapse onto spinal interneurons [ 36 ] .
acceleration of automatic postural responses not only voluntary reaction times , but also automatic postural responses to backward balance perturbations can be accelerated by a sas [ 28 ] , [ 37 ] .
in the present study , we found sas - induced acceleration of postural responses to backward , but not to forward perturbations .
these results mirror those previously reported by our group [ 28 ] .
it has been hypothesized that postural responses to both forward and backward perturbations are evoked from the reticular formation , but involve different neural circuits [ 28 ] with only backward - perturbation response pathways receiving input from startle circuits .
however , it remains to be investigated why the sas - induced acceleration of postural responses is direction specific .
although the sas - induced acceleration of postural responses was smaller than the acceleration of voluntary movements , there is evidence that sas - induced postural responses are consistent with a startreact effect as well .
previous studies have demonstrated that a sas can trigger a voluntary movement at similarly short onset latencies when applied in the absence of the imperative signal [ 18 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
this characteristic of startreact responses has proved to be applicable to postural responses as well .
two studies have shown that postural responses can be triggered by a sas in the absence of a balance perturbation [ 28 ] , [ 37 ] with similar latencies to those in the presence of a perturbation [ 28 ] .
because of this observation , it is unlikely that the sas - induced shortening of postural response latencies is due to intersensory facilitation .
furthermore , the observation of unidirectional sas - induced acceleration of postural responses is also not consistent with intersensory facilitation , as this mechanism would likely accelerate responses to both forward and backward perturbations .
subcortical structures can be facilitated by tdcs this study provides evidence for tdcs - induced subcortical facilitation in humans .
these findings are in agreement with the recently reported facilitation of reticulospinal and rubrospinal motor neurons by tdcs in anaesthetized cats [ 6 ] .
similar has also been reported in rats [ 40 ] , albeit evoked by cathodal - stimulation .
a previous observation already hinted at tdcs - induced subcortical facilitation in humans , but direct evidence was lacking .
it was reported that during and following tdcs there was an increase in regional cerebral blood flow in subcortical structures , including the red nucleus and the mesencephalic and pontine reticular nuclei [ 7 ] .
this observation may point at an effect of tdcs at the subcortical level , but its functional significance could not be established .
the present results demonstrate that tdcs application indeed changed the excitability of subcortical structures , leading to faster response onsets .
the facilitation of subcortical structures by tdcs may be explained by two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive .
first , the subcortical facilitation may have resulted from a change in the cortico - reticular drive .
second , the applied current may have directly changed the excitability of subcortical structures .
the latter hypothesis is supported by a modeling study on the spread of current during tdcs application using the same electrode configuration as in this study , which demonstrated the potential for direct subcortical effects [ 41 ] .
both mechanisms were found when tdcs was applied to anaesthetized cats in the study of bolzoni et al .
[ 6 ] .
alternatively , one might argue that the present results may be explained by an increased arousal or general attention caused by tdcs , which was not present during the sham condition .
an increase in arousal or attention could have affected both cortical and subcortical pathways .
indeed , it has shown that tdcs can improve attention and thereby reduces reaction times , likely via facilitation of cortical structures [ 42 ] .
the effect of attention or general arousal on sas - induced reaction times has not been investigated , which leaves the possibility of increased general arousal underlying the observed reduction in sas - induced onset latencies following tdcs .
however , this explanation does not seem to hold true for the observed acceleration of postural responses , as there are several studies that suggest that onset latencies of these responses are not influenced by attention or arousal .
for instance , responses onsets do not change when attention has to be divided between a postural and a concurrent cognitive task [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] .
moreover , in a study that evaluated automatic postural responses to external perturbations in participants while standing in a high postural threat condition , response onsets in the lower extremities were not influenced by anxiety [ 45 ] .
hence , it seems unlikely that the acceleration of subcortical motor responses by tdcs as found in the present study can solely be attributed to increased general arousal or attention .
role of the reticular formation in the startreact effect and postural responses the present results raise the question which subcortical structures can be facilitated by tdcs .
in the study of bolzoni et al. , tdcs application in anaesthetized cats yielded direct and indirect facilitation of reticulospinal motor neurons [ 6 ] .
there are several arguments why this may have been the mechanism underlying the present results as well .
there is compelling evidence that the pontomedullary reticular formation ( pmrf ) is critically involved in generating the automatic postural responses to external balance perturbations [ 36 ] , [ 46 ] as well as in the startreact effect [ 11 ] .
studies in monkeys and cats have indentified the pmrf as one of the subcortical structures that subserves motor preparation [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] .
as the pmrf is also a key structure in the startle reflex circuitry [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , it presumably plays a pivotal role in the release of pre - prepared motor programs , resulting in the startreact effect .
hence , the acceleration of fast sas - induced ankle and wrist movements and of automatic postural responses following tdcs application over the sensorimotor cortex most likely results from facilitation of the reticular formation .
in contrast , responses during reaction time tasks without a sas most likely originate from the cortex .
the tdcs - induced acceleration of ankle and wrist movements during trials without a sas therefore point to facilitation of cortical structures , which is in line with previous work [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
bilateral effects of tdcs although the anodal electrode was always positioned over the non - dominant motor region , we found no differences in the effects of tdcs between the dominant and non - dominant leg , both for cortically and subcortically organized responses .
one reason may be that the applied current was rather large , which may have resulted in a significant spread of current across the brain also affecting subcortical structures , including cortico - reticular pathways and the brainstem reticular formation .
the bilateral effects of tdcs on subcortical structures may thus be explained by a direct ( bilateral ) effect of tdcs on the reticular formation , or by a change in the cortico - reticular drive .
although cortico - reticular projections are predominantly ipsilateral in humans [ 14 ] , [ 53 ] , contralateral projections have also been identified [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] .
responses during reaction time tasks without a sas , which are mediated by cortical structures , were also bilaterally accelerated by tdcs .
this suggests that the direct cortical effects of tdcs were not strictly lateralized either , but the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated .
the bilateral effects may also be due to ipsilateral connectivity to lower limb motor neurons [ 56 ] .
alternatively , we cannot rule out that bilateral cortical effects resulted from increased arousal evoked by tdcs .
future studies the present results have implications for future studies investigating the effects of tdcs on cortically mediated responses .
as our study demonstrates that the common application of tdcs over the sensorimotor cortex also yields effects on a subcortical level , the possibility of such effects interacting with the cortical effects of interest should be considered .
in addition , future studies may investigate how the subcortical effects of tdcs can be enhanced .
bolzoni et al. reported that the facilitation of subcortical structures in anaesthetized cats is enhanced by repeated application of tdcs [ 6 ] .
we hypothesize that this may also be the case in humans , but this needs to be proven .
furthermore , a modeling study has suggested that the facilitation of ventrally located subcortical structures ( i.e. , the brainstem ) might be larger with the reference electrode placed in contact with the neck muscles ( extracephalic position ) compared to a supraorbital position [ 41 ] .
our paradigm might be useful to study this hypothesis .
however , the effects of the extracephalic positioning of the reference electrode should be closely monitored , as a case study reported on disturbed breathing , speech arrest and psychosis after brainstem stimulation [ 57 ] , [ 58 ] .
application in clinical practice as subcortical structures , in particular the reticular formation , are involved in motor preparation they could play a compensatory role in the recovery after corticospinal lesions [ 59 ] .
a recent study in monkeys suggested that the reticulospinal tract is indeed responsible for some functional recovery after acute corticospinal lesions , such as stroke [ 60 ] .
it has also been suggested that a similar compensatory mechanism may be at work in patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia [ 11 ] .
compensation by the reticular formation requires strengthening of the output , not the growth of new neural connections [ 59 ] .
the application of tdcs may , therefore , be useful to increase the activation of reticulospinal motoneurons or result in a stronger reticulospinal output , both of which could be beneficial for motor recovery and rehabilitation [ 6 ] .
interestingly , a recent study in patients with leukoaraoisis ( hyperintensities in the subcortical white matter ) showed that balance performance improved in response to a combined session of physical training and tdcs over the midline motor and premotor areas , but not following physical training alone [ 61 ] .
in light of the present results , these improvements may have resulted from tdcs - induced reticulospinal facilitation .

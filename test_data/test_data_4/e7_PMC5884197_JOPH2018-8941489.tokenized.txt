purpose the glaucoma stereo analysis study , a cross - sectional multicenter collaborative study , used a stereo fundus camera ( nonmyd wx ) to assess various morphological parameters of the optic nerve head ( onh ) in glaucoma patients .
we compared the associations of each parameter between the visual field loss progression group and no - progression group .
methods the study included 187 eyes of 187 patients with primary open - angle glaucoma or normal - tension glaucoma .
we divided the mean deviation ( md ) slope values of all patients into the progression group (< - 0.3 db / year ) and no - progression group (>= - 0.3 db / year ) .
onh morphological parameters were calculated with prototype analysis software .
the correlations between glaucomatous visual field progression and patient characteristics or each onh parameter were analyzed with spearman 's rank correlation coefficient .
results the md slope averages in the progression group and no - progression group were - 0.58 +/ - 0.28 db / year and 0.05 +/ - 0.26 db / year , respectively .
among disc parameters , vertical disc width ( diameter ) , disc area , cup area , and cup volume in the progression group were significantly less than those in the no - progression group .
logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between the visual field progression and disc area ( odds ratio 0.49 / mm2 disc area ) .
conclusion a smaller disc area may be associated with more rapid glaucomatous visual field progression .
1. introduction glaucomatous optic neuropathy ( gon ) is characterized by axon degeneration that can be observed as the thinning of the neural rim and enlargement of the cup in the optic nerve head ( onh ) .
the disc damage likelihood scale ( ddls ) was developed by bayer et al .
[ 1 ] and spaeth et al .
[ 2 ] for assessing the degree of optic nerve damage in gon .
this method reflects the disc size and divides discs into three sizes , small (< 1.5 mm ) , middle ( 1.5 - 2.0 mm ) , and large (> 2.0 mm ) , and combines the disc size with the radial width of the neural rim or the circumferential extent of the absence of the neural rim [ 1 , 2 ] .
it was shown that the ddls significantly correlates with all global and sectoral visual field indexes and with the sectoral rim area in heidelberg retina tomograph ( hrt ) ii measurements [ 3 ] .
a simultaneous stereo fundus camera with analysis software ( nonmyd wx , kowa company , ltd. , japan ) can provide onh images in 3d and a detailed quantitative display of the onh parameters .
the glaucoma stereo analysis study ( gsas ) is a multicenter study using this system to estimate various morphological parameters of the onh in japanese patients with gon [ 4 , 5 ] .
the gsas previously demonstrated that the ddls stage obtained through stereoscopic analysis was significantly inversely correlated with the md and positively correlated with the pattern standard deviation ( psd ) [ 6 ] .
these findings suggest that the ddls stage reflects the degree of visual field damage that is measured and expressed by the md and psd [ 6 ] .
since smaller discs can be categorized in higher stages in the ddls system , and a human histological study in a relatively large number of eyes ( 72 eyes from 56 donors ) found increasing axon numbers with greater optic disc size [ 7 ] , it is reasonable to speculate that the disc size may affect glaucomatous visual field progression .
in the present phase of the gsas , we examined the relationships between visual field progression and patient characteristics or various onh parameters .
2. patients and methods the gsas is a multicenter collaborative study and was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of helsinki .
the institutional review boards of the tohoku university graduate school of medicine , shimane university faculty of medicine , fukui - ken saiseikai hospital , sapporo teishin hospital , and st. marianna university school of medicine approved this study .
the formal written consent from patients is not required for this type of study , a hospital - based and retrospective study .
we analyzed anonymously all data gathered from the participating institutions .
one hundred and eighty - seven eyes of 187 patients with gon were recruited into this study from five institutions as previously reported [ 4 ] .
the methods of ophthalmic examination and data collection were described previously [ 4 ] .
briefly , presurgical refractive error data were collected from eyes that had undergone refractive procedures including cataract surgery .
data from at least six visual field examinations ( approximately every six months ) ( carl zeiss meditec , dublin , ca ) were also collected retrospectively with the humphrey visual field analyzer for each patient .
md slope values obtained from those data were divided into two groups : the visual field loss progression group (< - 0.3 db / year ) and no - progression group (>= - 0.3 db / year ) .
additional inclusion criteria included ( 1 ) best corrected visual acuity of 0.155 or better ( logmar ) ; ( 2 ) no congenital onh anomalies ; ( 3 ) onh size within the typical normal range , defined as a disc - macula distance - to - disc diameter ( dm / dd ) ratio of between approximately 2.4 and 3.0 ; ( 4 ) no clinically apparent secondary cause of glaucoma and no other disease affecting the visual field ; ( 5 ) no history of intraocular surgery other than cataract or glaucoma surgery ; ( 6 ) no history of cataract or glaucoma surgery in the previous 3 years ; and ( 7 ) glaucomatous visual field loss of better than - 12 db md [ 4 ] .
other exclusion criteria may include ( 1 ) retinal diseases , neuro - ophthalmological diseases , degenerative myopia , and central nervous system diseases which can affect the visual field ; ( 2 ) pseudoexfoliation ; ( 3 ) angle closure ; and ( 4 ) use of systemic or topical steroid .
the patients were also queried about a history of systemic hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and hyperlipidemia .
the stereo images of onh were obtained with a stereo fundus camera ( nonmyd wx ) .
the built - in software ( vk - 2 wx , prototype version , kowa company , ltd. , japan ) automatically calculates onh morphological parameters based on manually set contour lines for the onh disc and cup as described previously [ 4 ] .
the disc contour was delineated by the inner margin of elschnig 's scleral ring , and the cup contour was delineated by the outer cup margin , which was indicated by the bending of the onh vessels at the rim in accordance with the recommendations of the japan glaucoma society guideline for glaucoma , 3rd edition [ 4 ] .
2.1 .
statistical analysis continuous variables were expressed as mean values +/ - standard deviation .
demographic patient data and onh parameters were compared between the progression and no - progression groups using the t - test for continuous variables and fisher 's exact probability test for categorical variables .
correlations between glaucoma progression and onh parameters were assessed using stepwise logistic regression analysis in which progression or no progression was set as a dependent variable , and the 38 onh parameters reported previously [ 4 ] were set as independent variables .
in the stepwise logistic regression analysis , a forward selection method was used to determine the significant onh parameter ( s ) .
progression / no progression was fit to the determined onh parameter ( s ) using the nominal logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratio of progression .
the level of significance was 0.05 in all statistical tests .
3. results the characteristics of the 187 patients in the visual field progression group ( n = 50 ) and no - progression group ( n = 137 ) are shown in table 1 .
there was no significant difference in the average age and the gender ratio between the progression and no - progression groups ( table 1 ) .
there were significantly fewer patients with a history of systemic hypertension in the progression group compared with those in the no - progression group ( p = 0.037 , table 1 ) , and significantly more used beta - blocker or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor eyedrops in the former compared with those in the latter group ( p = 0.029 and p = 0.002 , resp. ) .
there was also a significant difference in the md between the progression ( - 5.88 +/ - 2.91 db ) and no - progression groups ( - 4.28 +/ - 3.28 db ) ( p = 0.003 , table 1 ) .
in addition , there was a significant difference in the psd between the progression ( 9.43 +/ - 3.69 db ) and no - progression ( 7.59 +/ - 4.25 db ) groups ( p = 0.007 , table 1 ) .
the averages of md slopes in the progression group and no - progression group were - 0.58 +/ - 0.28 db / year and 0.05 +/ - 0.26 db / year , respectively ( p < 0.0001 , table 1 ) .
the onh parameters in the two groups are shown in table 2 .
among these parameters , vertical disc width ( diameter ) and disc area in the progression group were significantly less than those in the no - progression group ( p = 0.017 and p = 0.016 , resp. , table 2 ) .
unexpectedly , the cup area and cup volume in the progression group were also significantly less than those in the no - progression group ( p = 0.029 and p = 0.04 , resp. , table 2 ) .
therefore , further statistical analysis was performed to clarify the association between onh parameters and visual field progression .
stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that among the 38 onh parameters , only the disc area was selected as a significant factor associated with visual field progression ( p = 0.013 ) .
in the nominal logistic regression model ( figure 1 ) , the odds ratio of visual field loss progression was calculated to be 0.49 / mm2 disc area .
4. discussion the present study found that a history of systemic hypertension is not a risk factor for visual field progression , since fewer patients in the progression group had systemic hypertension .
consistent with this result , previous studies showed that a lower diastolic blood pressure was associated with glaucomatous progression [ 8 , 9 ] .
comparisons of other characteristics demonstrated that the use of beta - blocker or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor eyedrops was more common in the visual field progression group .
it is reasonable to assume that prostaglandin ( pg ) eyedrops are the first choice for administration in glaucoma patients , and therefore , pg alone is not associated with disease progression .
however , the administration of multiple types of eyedrops may be associated with progression .
we also found significantly worse md and psd values in the progression group compared with the no - progression group .
this is consistent with a previous review article demonstrating that the baseline md was significantly associated with the incidence of progression , with the incidence rate increasing by 0.9 percentage points per additional db of md loss [ 10 ] .
it is also interesting to note previous findings showing that the rate of progression increased with the severity of visual field loss ( beta = 0.18 ; p = 0.001 ) in patients with mild visual field loss ( md > - 6 db ) but did not increase in the same manner in patients with moderate ( md <= - 6 to >= - 12 db ) or severe loss ( md < - 12 db ) [ 11 ]. that study suggested that in the most severe cases , visual field worsening cannot be observed as the field gets closer to total perimetric blindness [ 11 ] .
because we excluded patients with severe visual field loss worse than - 12 db md , the average md in the 187 patients included in this study was - 4.71 +/ - 3.26 db , meaning that 68 % could be categorized as having mild field loss [ 4 ] .
in the nominal logistic regression model ( figure 1 ) , the smallest disc exists in the no - progression group ( the right y - axis ) ; therefore , it seems that merely the disc size cannot distinguish the visual field progression group from the no visual field progression group .
in fact , there are several controversial reports regarding the disc size and glaucomatous damage .
for example , some reports suggested that a large disc is a risk factor and the stress to the lamina cribrosa is greater in eyes with a larger disc than those with a smaller disc [ 12 ] .
in contrast , other studies suggested that larger discs were more likely to be classified as glaucomatous whether they were glaucomatous or not , while small discs were more likely to be classified as normal [ 13 , 14 ] .
moreover , two different groups reported that the retinal nerve fiber layer ( rnfl ) thickness significantly increased with a greater optic disc size [ 15 , 16 ] , although care must be taken in interpreting the relationship between disc size and rnfl thickness found in optical coherence tomography studies [ 6 ] .
taken together with the finding that the optic nerve fiber count increased with greater disc size in a human histological study [ 7 ] , it is possible that smaller optic discs may contain fewer optic nerve axons than larger ones .
therefore , one hypothesis is that smaller optic discs may be more vulnerable than larger discs .
consistent with this hypothesis , we found that the vertical disc width and disc area in the visual field progression group were significantly smaller than those in the no - progression group .
however , cup area and cup volume in the progression group were also smaller than those in the no - progression group .
because the vertical ( 0.83 +/ - 0.08 versus 0.82 +/ - 0.08 ) and horizontal c / d ratios ( 0.73 +/ - 0.08 versus 0.75 +/ - 0.09 ) did not differ between the two groups in the current study , smaller cup area and cup volume may be the result of smaller disc size in the progression group .
moreover , it is interesting to note that the results of a recent study indicated that the c / d ratio is smaller for small discs and positively correlated with the disc size in healthy human eyes [ 17 ] .
in the present study , the curve in the nominal logistic regression model ( figure 1 ) indicates the predicted probability of visual field progression ( the left y - axis ) , implicating that larger discs may have lower probability .
our current logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between visual field loss progression and disc area ( odds ratio 0.49 / mm2 disc area ) , indicating that if the disc area increased by 1 mm2 , the probability of progression would decrease by about half .
this also means that if the disc area decreased by 1 mm2 , the probability of progression would be approximately twofold greater .
this study had several limitations .
it was retrospective and hospital based. from a technical viewpoint , in some cases such as those with temporal peripapillary atrophy or shallow cupping , it can be difficult to define the margins accurately .
moreover , it is possible that the amount of rim width asymmetry is an important factor which may affect disc size results , although the rim decentering , which may reflect with asymmetry , did not differ significantly between the progression group and no - progression group .
in addition , although the typical normal onh size was defined as a dm / dd ratio of between approximately 2.4 and 3.0 , both the disc size and the dm distance may increase in some cases such as high myopia .
however , most cases included in the present study were within the typical normal range , and therefore , it remains to be elucidated whether smaller or larger discs also fit this concept .
nonetheless , taking the results of the present phase of the gsas together , these findings suggest that a smaller disc area may be associated with more rapid glaucomatous visual field progression .

the safety of food and feed depends to a great deal on quality control .
numerous compounds and organisms may contaminate food and feed commodities and thus pose a health risk for consumers .
the compound of interest in this review is ochratoxin a ( ota ) , a secondary metabolite of the fungi aspergillus and penicillium .
due to its adverse health effects , detection and quantification are of utmost importance .
quality control of food and feed requires extraction and analysis , including tlc , hplc , ms , and immunochemical methods .
each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages .
however , with regard to costs and rapidity , immunochemical methods have gained much interest in the last decade .
in this review an introduction to immunochemistry and assay design will be given to elucidate the principles .
further , the application of the various formats to the detection and quantification of ochratoxin will be described , including the use of commercially available kits .
ochratoxin a ( ota ) detection quantification immunochemical methods 1 .
introduction ochratoxins belong to the group of mycotoxins that are produced as secondary metabolites by fungi , in particular aspergillus and penicillium .
these fungi flourish under special conditions of temperature and humidity .
ochratoxins include ochratoxin a ( ota ) , ochratoxin b ( otb ) , ochratoxin c ( otc ) and ochratoxin alpha ( otalpha ) , of which ota is considered the most toxic .
they are teratogenic , mutagenic , hepatotoxic , nephrotoxic and immunesuppressive , and thus pose a serious health problem for exposed humans and animals .
because the fungi infest several kinds of crops for human and animal consumption , the metabolites may be present in all kinds of raw agricultural materials , commodities and beverages .
due to their toxic properties regulations for mycotoxins , including ochratoxins , have been established , at this moment in 100 countries and readjusted in the course of time [ 1,2,3,4 ] .
consequently , food / feed quality control is extensively performed .
analysis includes the mouse bioassay , tlc , gc , hplc , ms and various immunochemical methods , generally after extraction of the target compound ( s ) .
conventional analytical methods and extraction methods are beyond the scope of this review and have been described elsewhere [ 1,5,6,7 ] .
in the present review the focus is on immunochemical methods for ota analysis .
however , because iac ( immunoaffinity chromatography ) uses antibody for additional purification and concentration , this technique will also be described herein .
additional reviews covering conventional analytical techniques for mycotoxins , including immunochemical techniques , were published by krska et al .
[ 8 ] and turner et al .
[ 9 ] .
the ubiquitous presence of ota has been assessed in assay investigations and national surveys of raw and processed agricultural and derived products ( cereals , food , feed , coffee , wine , beer , juices , cow milk ) , and the matrix has been taken into account in the development of detection methods [ 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 ] .
ingestion due to consumption has been deduced from levels found in bodily fluids and tissues in humans and animals [ 10,19,22,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51 ] .
monitoring of food / feed for the presence of mycotoxins / ota and disposal of contaminated products should lower human and animal health risk .
immunochemical detection methods vary from simple immunoassay to highly sophisticated immunosensors .
because immunochemical methods are principally all based on antibodies , this review starts with an overview of conventional production methods of antibodies , the advantages and disadvantages as well as advanced production of antibodies and fragments thereof .
then the various formats of immunoassays will be discussed , wherein examples for the application in ochratoxin detection will be given , although not exhaustive .
for further reference , see the reviews of zheng ( 2006 ) [ 52 ] and goryacheva et al .
( 2009 ) [ 53 ] for immunochemical methods for mycotoxins , including ota .
a review of available immunoassays kits was given by huybrechts and tangni ( 2010 ) [ 54 ] .
in order to evaluate the suitability of immunochemical assays , there are several points to consider .
first , the antibody / assay should meet the conditions for a reliable analytical method as with any method .
for immunochemical methods , iso norms have been established ( iso 15087 ) .
second , the norms for the presence of the target compounds in the matrix / product to be measured should be taken into account with regard to the detection limit and working range of an assay .
validation of a newly developed immunoassay also requires reference materials , which may be difficult to obtain , especially in the case of highly toxic and / or complex compounds .
for ota in agricultural products such reference materials are available now .
in this review the development , design , evaluation and use of immunochemical methods for the detection and / or quantification of ota are described .
special attention will be given to chemical / synthetic " antibodies " .
2. antibodies the antibody forms the core component of any immunochemical method , because it is the element that recognizes and binds its target compound ( antigen ) .
antibodies are components of the immune system of animals that defend the body against intruding substances and organisms .
they are produced by specialized cells of the immune systems and they comprise several forms : iga , igd , ige , igg , igm , igy ( avian ) .
the predominant form secreted in blood is igg and this form is generally used in immunochemistry .
the production of antibodies starts with the immunization of experimental animals , such as rat , rabbit , mouse , sheep , horse , goat , chicken .
to be able to raise an immune reaction , the injected compound ( immunogen ) has to meet several conditions : > 1000 dalton , foreign for the body and with a 3 - dimensional structure .
in the case of a small compound ( hapten ) , such as ochratoxin , the particular compound is generally coupled to an immunogenic protein , optionally via a spacer group .
coupling proteins include bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) , keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( klh ) , thyroglobulin ( tg ) , polylysine , among others , although bsa is predominantly used .
coupling procedures are known from literature .
generally , when a hapten belongs to a group of related compounds , the coupling to a carrier protein is performed such that the moiety unique for that hapten is exposed and the carrier protein is bound to another site of the compound .
in the case of ota , the free carboxylic group is commonly used for coupling because of easy chemistry ( figure 1 ) .
as will be clear from the section below , this provides antibodies with low cross - reactivity to related compounds .
reversibly , the most resembling mycotoxins otb ( figure 2 ) showing sometimes cross - reactivity in ota immunoassays , provides , when coupled in the same way , antibodies highly specific for otb [ 55 ] .
figure 1 chemical structure of ochratoxin a. figure 2 chemical structure of ochratoxin b. immunization involves primary injection of the immunogen , followed by several booster injections .
after about 2 - 6 months the titer ( concentration ) of the desired antibody is , in general , sufficiently high for use in an assay .
the serum of the animal may be used as such , but in most cases the antibodies are isolated and purified with standard methods .
immune serum or purified antibodies are designated polyclonal antibodies ( pab ) , because they comprise a population of antibodies with different affinities and specificities [ 56 ] .
another widely used production method involves the hybridoma technique [ 56,57 ] .
traditionally , the immunogen is used to immunize mice , although nowadays other species are also used .
after 2 - 3 boosters , the spleen is isolated , processed to splenocytes which are fused with myeloma cells , and cultured in limited dilution so that each single antibody producing cell will give rise to a separate cell culture ( hybridomas ) .
then the best performing culture is chosen for mass production and isolation of the antibody .
such antibodies are designated monoclonal antibodies ( mab ) .
in contrast to polyclonal antibodies , monoclonal antibodies consist of one type of antibody with defined affinity and specificity .
in addition , monoclonal antibodies can be produced as long as a hybridoma is viable .
sometimes monoclonal antibodies are less stable than polyclonal antibodies .
alternative forms of antibodies include recombinant antibodies , phage displayed antibodies , plant antibodies , and antibodies fragments that have retained their antigen binding domain .
for production methods and properties , there have been published numerous articles and reviews [ 58,59,60,61,62 ] .
however , these have until now not been used for the development of immunoassays for ota .
once an antibody has been obtained , it has to be characterized with regard to specificity and affinity for use in an assay to be suitable for the detection of its target compound .
importantly , in order to have high specificity in an assay , the properties of the antibody with regard to cross - reactivity to related compounds should be determined in subsequent assays .
closely related compounds comprise otb , otc , otd , otalpha , coumarin , oh - coumarin .
because of the small size of these compounds , they fit into the binding pocket of the antibody and their common moieties ( epitope , binding part ) may lead to more or less affinity for the antibody and thus cross - reactivity .
due to a completely different structure , other mycotoxins that are often found on and / or in crops as co - toxins generally will show no cross - reactivity and thus no interference in an immunoassay .
3. immunoassay formats the immunochemical reaction , i.e. , the binding of antibody and antigen , in an assay is not visible and therefore several means to detect the reaction product , the immune complex , have been developed based on signal - generating components and appropriate measuring devices .
the various immunoassays are named based on the signal - generating component or tracer .
3.1 .
ria ( radioimmunoassay ) the first immunoassays made use of a radioactive tracer consisting of the target compound incorporated with a radionuclide , such as 3h , 14c , 125i , although other radionuclides may also be used .
the principle of a ria is the competition between labeled and unlabeled compound for a limited number of binding sites on the antibody .
the more unlabeled target compound in a sample , the less tracer is bound to the antibody and radioactivity counting yields a measure for the concentration of target compound in a sample , based on a series of standards .
it will be appreciated that 3h and 14c will hardly influence the physic - chemical properties of the tracer and its behavior will hardly change , in contrast to 125i , which is a larger moiety .
in order to be able to count only the radioactivity of the immune complex , a separation step is needed .
for small compounds , dextran coated charcoal has often been used to perform this separation , followed by centrifugation .
larger target compounds in complex with their binding antibody may be separated using e.g. , peg , followed by centrifugation .
an alternative separation method is the use of equilibrium dialysis ( ed ) where only the free fraction is passing a membrane .
in earlier days , ochratoxin was analyzed by ria using polyclonal antibodies in several formats .
for example , aalund et al .
( 1975 ) [ 63 ] used ota - bovine igg as an immunogen to produce polyclonal antibodies and 125i - ovalbumin - ota as a tracer , followed by a precipitation step .
the detection limit was 20 microg / l , which is quite high .
this may be due to the large difference between the tracer that includes ovalbumine , a relatively large protein , and ota itself .
the use of 3h - ota as a tracer in combination with ed for separation of bound and free fraction , was described by chu et al .
( 1976 ) [ 64 ] .
here the detection range was from 1 - 20 ng / ml. rousseau et al .
( 1985 ) [ 65 ] developed a 14c - based ria in combination with a polyclonal antibody for the detection of ota in barley .
the detection limit was 0.5 ng / ml and the antibody was rather specific for ota , showing low cross - reactivity with related compounds .
in a further study this group also analyzed ota in serum with a detection limit of 0.4 ng / ml [ 66 ] .
a 125i - based ria kit was used by fukal and reisnerova ( 1990 ) [ 10 ] to assess the ingestion of ota by humans by measuring ota in serum ( detection limit 100 ng / l ) .
their conclusion was that ota is actually ingested and present in serum .
fukal ( 1990 ) [ 67 ] reported that , based on measurements using the same kit , food and feed may contain ota , but it was not detected in porcine kidney .
due to health hazards of radiolabeled compounds and specialized waste disposal , ria has not been in use for a long time .
advanced immunochemical methods included various alternative tracers and recently even label - free methods .
3.2 .
eia ( enzyme immunoassay )/ elisa ( enzyme - linked immuno sorbent assay ) a great advancement in immunoassay was the replacement of radionuclides by enzymes in combination with a substrate that is converted into a detectable colored product .
there are many examples of possible enzymes , but hrp ( horse radish peroxide ) and alp ( alkaline phosphatase ) are used predominantly .
the development of eia was accompanied by the application of solid supports such as plastic reaction tubes or microtiter plates whereon immunoreagents are coated and the immunochemical reaction is performed ( elisa ) .
after the reaction , the supernatant solution containing unbound fraction is discarded and the signaling enzyme reaction is performed .
in such formats the steps of adding separation means and centrifugation are avoided , which shortens the assay time .
elisa may be designed in various formats .
the simplest formats are the direct competitive elisa ( dcelisa ) and indirect competitive elisa ( icelisa ) .
the former involves the coating of antibody onto the walls of a tube or microtiter plate , adding standard / sample , followed by antibody and tracer .
after incubation , the reaction solution is discarded and the enzyme reaction is performed , which is analyzed with spectrophotometry .
in the icelisa the hapten , generally coupled to a carrier protein , is coated onto the support , standard / sample is added , followed by labeled antibody .
further reaction steps are similar to the dcelisa. between the reaction steps extensive washing is included .
there exist various variants of this kind of enzyme immunoassay , such as the icelisa wherein a secondary antibody raised against the primary antibody , for example , anti - rabbit igg for polyclonals or anti - mouse igg for monoclonals , is labeled .
secondary antibody may also be used as a first coating layer to capture primary antibody , where the reaction takes place .
further alternative formats are described in literature and the reader is referred to a recent review [ 68 ] .
elisa has been the preferred method to detect and quantify ota in raw products , food , feed , beverages , bodily fluids and tissues to assess its presence and concentration for either exposure risks , quality control and as a measure of ingestion and accumulation .
table 1 provides some data found in literature .
formats used for ota other than elisa are discussed in further sections below .

in - house production of antibodies is a tedious procedure and requires facilities that are not available to each lab .
for the development of an immunoassay commercially available pab or mab may be used .
although elisa is basically a simple analytical method that does not require highly trained technicians , the development , design and validation does .
therefore , as an alternative , immunochemical analysis may be performed with commercial elisa kits .
use of an elisa kit for the analysis of wheat flour ( turkey ) revealed that 83 % of the samples contained ota [ 25 ] .
an ota elisa kit in combination with an iac kit was validated for analysis of ota in wine .
the detection limit was 0.054 microg / l , working range 0.25 - 9 microg / l ; the recovery 94 - 102 % ; and results compared good with hplc .
a survey of the presence of mycotoxins in herbs ( spain ) using commercial iac columns and elisa kits with a detection limit for ota of 0.025 microg / kg showed that 99 % of the samples were contaminated [ 30 ] .
although somewhat less toxic , otb is quite similar to ota and is often a co - contaminant .
to be able to detect otb in the same samples , a mab and an elisa were developed by heussner et al .
( 2007 ) [ 54 ] .
the same strategy as for ota was used , i.e. , coupling of carrier proteins to the carboxylic moiety .
a detection limit of 27 nm was reported , with low cross - reactivity ( 3.3 %) for ota .
3.3 .
sandwich elisa for larger target compounds containing several epitopes , the sandwich elisa is a convenient format .
herein the solid support is coated with one antibody raised to one epitope of the compound ; target compound is added , followed by a second antibody raised against another epitope of the compound .
second antibody may be labeled or a third labeled antibody may be used for detection .
because ota has a low molecular mass and fits into the binding pocket of antibody , there is no further moiety exposed for binding of second antibody .
however , a sandwich elisa system has been developed to detect several molds ( aspergillus , penicillium , fusarium ) simultaneously by using monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular polysaccharide of these species [ 85 ] .
interestingly , punyatong et al .
( 2003 ) [ 86 ] described a sandwich elisa using two monoclonal antibodies produced in - house with ota - hsa as immunogen .
the developed elisa , one mab coated on microtiter plate and one hrp - labeled mab , showed 50 % binding at 35 pg / assay , which is quite sensitive .
no further validation or application has been described .
3.4 .
chemiluminenscent immunoassay ( cl - ia ) some samples show high matrix effects in eia and dilution may be a means to eliminate them .
however , that means that the assay should be more sensitive .
according to yu et al .
( 2011 ) [ 87 ] a cl - ia may offer an elegant solution .
they designed an assay using soy bean peroxidase in combination with luminol and an enhancer ( 3 - ( 10 ' - phenothiazinyl ) propane - 1 - sulfonate / 4 - morpholinopyridine ) and they achieved a limit of detection ( lod ) of 0.01 ng / ml and a working range of 0.02 - 0.3 ng / ml in several agricultural products .
when samples were compared to a direct competitive elisa , it appeared that in some samples being negative in the elisa , ota could be detected .
these cl - ia results were comparable to those of qui ( 2010 ) [ 88 ] .
herein an indirect clia with hrp - labeled secondary antibody provided a simple , fast and sensitive screening assay for corn samples with an lod of 0.04 microg / kg .
3.5 .
fluorescent immunoassay ( fia ) fluorescent immunoassays are a variant of immunoassays , wherein the tracer contains a fluorofore as a label .
the advantage of fluorofores is their broad range of excitation and emission wave lengths and availability .
however , fia requires special equipment and microtiter plates ( black or white ) , and care should be taken to avoid background fluorescence interference .
the design of fias may be direct ( labeled hapten ) , indirect ( labeled primary antibody and with labeled secondary antibody .
although simple fia has not been used for analytical purposes , there exist some variant fia , which are described below .
3.5.1 .
time - resolved fluorescent immunoassay ( tr - fia ) the characteristic of tr - fia is the use of fluorofores with a longer fluorescence life time , which eliminates background fluorescence and thus enables a more sensitive and specific assay [ 89 ] .
this technique forms the core in delphia immunoassays [ 90 ] , but many other formats and applications are possible .
the use of lanthanide labels in tr - fia with luminescence detection has been reviewed by hagan and zuchner ( 2011 ) [ 91 ] .
in addition , when using two different labels , multi - analyte immunoassay is feasible .
an example of mycotoxins detection has been given by huang et al .
( 2009 ) [ 92 ] who developed a tr - fia for ota and aflatoxin b1 ( afl b1 ) using sm and eu as a label , respectively .
in this format , antigen - protein was coated onto microtiter plates , then sample and antibody ( mab for ota and pab for afl b1 ) were added , followed by differently labeled second antibody .
this tr - fia was validated and showed a detection limit for ota of 0.05 microg / l ( range 0.05 - 50 microg / l ) and for aflatoxin b of 0.02 microg / l ( range 0.02 - 100 microg / l ) .
3.5.2 .
fluorescence - polarization immunoassay ( fp - ia ) another variant fluorescent immunoassay is fp - ia. the principle of this technique has been given in a review of maragos ( 2009 ) [ 93 ] , including a table showing results from literature for mycotoxins .
in short , the binding of a hapten to its antibody is detected by measuring the change in tumbling motion of the particular fluorofore resulting in a change in observed polarization .
the solution containing the immunoreagents is exposed to plane - polarized light and the emission light is separated by a vertical and horizontal polarizer .
the advantage of fp - ia is that the complete assay is performed in solution , avoiding washing and separation of bound and free fraction .
an example of the application of fp - fia can be found in a publication of zezza et al .
( 2009 ) [ 94 ] .
this group measured ota in red wine using both their own and a commercial mab .
the assay was validated with spiked samples and compared to iac / hplc .
a detection limit of 0.7 ng / ml ( below the eu norm of 2.0 ng / ml ) was achieved .
3.5.3 .
fret ( fluorescence resonance energy transfer ) immunoassay the technique of separation - free , homogeneous fret immunoassay is described by kreissig et al .
( 2011 ) [ 95 ] .
such an assay uses electronic excited state energy transfer .
both the tracer and the antibody are labeled with a fluorescent tag , a donor and an acceptor respectively .
when binding occurs fluorescence is quenched , but displacement by the target compound eliminates this quenching and fluorescence can be measured .
a fret assay , wherein the binding of ota to its antibody is detected , was developed by li et al .
( 2011 ) [ 96 ] .
after optimizing reaction conditions , an lod of 1 ng / ml was achieved , comparable to other immunoassay formats and a commercial kit .
there was no cross - reactivity with otb and the recovery in spiked wheat samples was around 100 % .
3.5.4 .
fluorescent micro - array immunoassay an alternative immunoassay format for ota has been described by ngundi et al .
( 2005 ) [ 97 ] .
here a pretreated glass slide is functionalized with neutravidin .
ota - biotine conjugate is patterned onto the slide and then sample plus labeled ( cy5 , fluorescent ) antibody ( pab , commercial ) are reacted by addition through flow channels .
after the immunochemical reaction the slide is analyzed by fluorescence ccd imaging .
the detection limit varied from 3.8 - 100 ng / g for various samples of cereals , macaroni , coffee and wine .
a feasibility study into the development of a multi - analyte rapid screening microarray device was described by lamberti ( 2009 ) [ 98 ] .
herein the presence of both aflatoxin b1 and fumonisin b1 could be detected on bsa - conjugates bound to functionalized ( co - polymer ) glass slides .
this design holds promise for future adaptation to include other mycotoxins , including ota .
3.6 .
lateral flow immunoassay ( lf - ia ) rapid screening of samples for contaminants , including ota , may be performed using lateral flow immunoassay , a form of paper immunochromatography and also called strip tests .
a review of the technique was recently reported by posthuma ( 2012 ) [ 99 ] and the application was reviewed by bazin et al .
( 2010 ) [ 4 ] .
lf - ia relies on the movement of immunoreagents over a porous material containing pads or lines of target conjugate , sample and antibody , wherein either the target conjugate is labeled or the antibody .
the principle of lf - ia is the same as in an eia .
the label may be a chromofore , but nowadays labels consisting of nanoparticles are preferred .
the most simple format is the dipstick ( mentioned in the reviews of prieto - simon and campas ( 2009 ) [ 29 ] and goryacheva et al. ( 2009 ) [ 53 ]) .
in fact , with haptens as target compounds only the indirect format is feasible .
thus to the porous material are added a hapten - conjugate pad and optionally a test line with secondary antibody , preceded by a release pad and followed by an absorbent pad .
sample and labeled antibody are mixed and added to the release pad and then passed through the porous material by capillary force , competition reaction takes place at the conjugate pad where the signal evaluated visually or measured with appropriate devices .
lf - ia may be designed for multi - analyte detection .
for example , using au - nanoparticles coupled to mab 's was applied and validated by shim et al .
( 2009 ) [ 82 ] for the detection of both ota and zearelanone in spiked corn samples .
the visual detection limits were 2.5 and 5 ng / ml , respectively .
results were compared to dcelisa and hplc .
a similar lf - ia was developed by anfossi et al .
( 2011 ) [ 83 ] using commercially available pab that were coupled to au - nanoparticles .
here nitrocellulose strips were used for application of ota - bsa lines .
detection of the immunecomplex was performed with a scanner and a detection limit of 0.15 microg / kg of cereal extracts was demonstrated .
results compared very well with lc - fld .
3.7 .
flow - through immunoassay immunoassays performed in microtiter plates require washing steps and discarding supernatant .
to simplify this format , membrane - based immunoassays were developed .
here the antibody is coupled to a membrane attached to a well and the immunochemical reaction using enzyme - labeled antigen / hapten takes place on this membrane .
addition of substrate / chromofore leads to a visible spot on the membrane that may be evaluated visually .
it is a rapid , semi - quantitative screening method and kits for ota are commercially available .
flow - through immunoassay for ota has been applied by de saeger and van pethegem ( 1999 ) [ 76 ] using mab and ota - hrp .
the assay required 15 min of assay time and the detection limit was 0.4 ng / ml. the same working group has validated membrane - based immunoassay kits for ota and t - 2 toxin in a ring test with cereal samples ( detection limit for ota 4 microg / kg , for t - 2 toxin 50 microg / kg ) , wherein the results were compared to hplc and gc. comparable results were obtained for ota in spiked roasted coffee samples by sibanda et al .
( 2002 ) [ 78 ] .
their membrane - based assay showed a detection limit of 4 microg / kg and results were confirmed with hplc in the scope of a patent application .
a recent development of flow - through immunoassay is multi - analyte flow cytometry using the multaanalyte profiling ( xmap ) technique in combination with a luminex apparatus ( austin , tx , usa ) .
discrimination of analytes is based on color - coded superparamagnetic beads and detection is performed with fluorescent label .
the immunochemical reaction occurs in 96 - wells microtiter plates , wherein washing and separation steps are performed by application of a magnet .
both a direct and an indirect format were described for the simultaneous detection of ota and other mycotoxins .
in the indirect format the beads a coupled with ota - conjugate , reacted with sample and antibody or biotinylated antibody .
for signal generation , secondary antibody - pe ( phycoerythrin ) or streptavidin - pe is used , respectively ( peters et al. 2011 , anderson et al. 2010 ) [ 100,101 ] .
the detection limits found were in the range of 10 - 30 ng / g for spiked cereals .
a direct format , wherein antibody is coupled to the beads and the reaction is performed by adding sample and ota - pe conjugate for competition assay is described by aqai et al .
( 2011 ) [ 102 ] and showed a detection limit of 0.15 ng / g. the sensitivity of the luminex method and multi - analyte mode makes it superior to other immunochemical methods .
4. immunosensors sensors comprise devices for real - time , on - site detection of target compounds .
biosensors use a biomolecule as core component and in immunosensors an antibody is the recognition element , wherein the binding to its cognate ligand leads to a detectable signal .
immunosensors exist of a reaction surface , a transducer and a detector .
transducers may be electrochemical , optical and gravimetric ( acoustic wave ( aw )/ quartz crystal microbalance ( qcm )) .
the techniques have been explained in several reviews [ 103,104,105,106,107,108 ] .
the most commonly used immunosensors are based on optical transducers and surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) is the most known and utilized .
devices generally comprise the biacore ( uppsala , sweden ) which are available in several embodiments .
even a portable spr system , the spreeta , has been mentioned for rapid field mycotoxins analysis [ 109 ] .
toxin detection with spr was reviewed by hodnik and anderluh ( 2009 ) [ 110 ] .
practical application of spr sensing for ota was described by adanyi et al .
( 2007 ) [ 111 ] for the parallel determination of aflatoxin b1 and ota in barley and wheat flour samples .
the immunochemical format was competition immunoassay with hapten - bsa immobilized on the sensor surface and the use of specific monoclonal antibodies in combination with sample flowing over the surface for measurement .
this format revealed a detection range between 0.5 and 10 ng / ml. a similar spr assay for ota , but with highly improved sensitivity was reported by yuan et al .
( 2009 ) [ 112 ] .
they used a new conjugate , ota - peg - bsa , for immobilization and au - nanoparticle coupled monoclonal antibody to achieve much better performance , enabling a range of lods from 0.058 - 0.4 ng / ml in cereals and beverages .
second most used immunosensors are based on electrochemical detection .
various parameters for the design of an electrochemical immunosensors for ota in an indirect format were investigated by prieto - simon et al .
[ 113 ] , such as the coating conjugate ( ota - bsa / avidin - ota ) , polyclonal or monoclonal antibody , and enzyme - conjutate ( ota - hrp / ota - alp ) .
in the best performing and most stable embodiment a detection limit of 0.7 ng / ml was achieved .
in a comparable format using ota - bsa , monoclonal anti - ota , but alp - labeled secondary antibody for detection a very low detection level of 8.2 pg / ml was found [ 114 ] .
this sensor performed also well in corn samples for matrix effects .
a direct format in an electrochemical immunosensors using polyclonal antibody on a modified gold electrode in conjunction with ota - hrp provided a detection limit of 12 ng / ml [ 115 ] .
recently , an electrochemical competitive immunosensor with a detection limit of 0.10 ng / ml for ota , validated using certified wheat samples , was described by vidal et al .
( 2011 ) [ 116 ] .
performance was improved by using ota - bsa on au - nanoparticles on the sensor surface , biotinylated monoclonal antibody as binding component and extravidin - hrp for signal generation .
an even lower detection limit , 60 pg / ml , was achieved by urusov et al .
( 2011 ) [ 117 ] by signal enhancement due to use of second antibody - colloidal gold particle conjugate .
the application of magnetic nanoparticles ( mnp ) , which show various advantages in terms of surface area , stability of bound antibodies , improved orientation of the antibodies and fast assay kinetics , was described by zamfir et al .
[ 118 ] .
the design comprised a gold surface containing several layers of self - assembling monomers , bsa and mnps coated with mab .
detection was performed with both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( eis ) and spr , providing a detection limit of 0.01 ng / ml and 0.94 ng / ml , respectively .
results of the assay of spiked white wine were compared to elisa .
5. synthetic / chemical antibodies a rather new development in binding chemistry and assays comprises synthetic or chemical " antibodies " , such as mips ( molecularly imprinted polymers ) and aptamers ( single - stranded oligonucleotides ) .
mips are synthetic polymers with selectivity and specificity for a particular target compound .
they are synthesized by mixing target compound and ( vinyl ) monomers in suspension and then perform polymerization , followed by removal of the target compound .
what remains are structures that can specifically harbor the target compound and may be used as alternatives to antibodies in the same applications .
the synthesis of mips is illustrated in a review of whitcombe and vulfson ( 2001 ) [ 119 ] .
a comparison between mips and antibodies is given by lavignac et al .
( 2004 ) [ 120 ] , indicating affinities of mips being lower than of antibodies , but having the advantage of assays to be performed in non - aqueous conditions .
they also describe the characterization of radio - molecularly , fluoro - molecularly enzyme - linked molecularly imprinted sorbent assays for a range of small compounds , including non - immunogenic analytes .
the application of mip - based solid phase extraction ( mip - spe ) for environmental pollutants from water , soil and tissues , as well as mip - based sensors combined with various transduction methods for environmental analytes , including the mycotoxins zearalenone , has been reviewed by pichon et al .
( 2008 ) [ 121 ] .
although this technique has not been described for ota , it is a promising development both for extraction and detection purposes .
aptamers are another form of chemical binding entities .
they are short single - stranded dna or rna ligands containing 10 - 50 variable bases .
aptamers and opportunities for application were discovered already more than 20 years ago .
since that time several reviews have been published about principles and production [ 122 ] , signaling in aptamer - based biosensors , also called aptasensors [ 123 ] , electrochemical ( ec ) aptasensors [ 124 ] , analytical / pharmaceutical applications [ 125,126,127 ] , homogeneous assays with aptazymes wherein aptamers regulate the activity of dna / rnazymes [ 128 ] and aptasensor with fluorescence detection [ 129,130 ] .
in practice , having synthesized a dna or rna library , aptamers against a particular target are selected by the procedure called selex ( systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment ) .
herein the library is incubated with target , the dna / rna - target complex is isolated and eluted and the eluted dna / rna is concentrated and amplified .
once a desired aptamer has been obtained , it may be used in formats similar to immunoaffinity columns , immunoassays and immunosensors using comparable sensing techniques. with regard to ota , an aptamer specific for ota was applied to an affinity column to capture ota from wheat sample extracts with known concentration , followed by fluorometric analysis [ 131 ] .
an elisa - like enzyme - linked aptamer assay ( elaa ) in the direct and indirect format for the detection of ota was developed by barthelmebs et al .
( 2011 ) [ 132 ] and evaluated for analysis of spiked red wine samples .
the method , especially the direct format , compared well to mab - based direct / indirect elisa and showed a detection limit of 1 ng / ml with an analysis time of 125 min , which makes it a useful screening method for routine use .
aptasensors for mycotoxins with electrochemical detection were developed by several groups .
for example , kuang et al .
( 2010 ) [ 133 ] designed and ota aptasensor including 3 dnas , dna1 for capturing dna2 ( ota aptamer ) on the sensor surface and dna3 on gold nanoparticles ( aunp ) for ec detection using methylene blue for detection of ota binding to the aptamer and signal amplification .
aptamer coupled to aunp was used by bonel et al .
( 2011 ) [ 134 ] for ec detection in a competitive assay with ota - hrp .
the sensor was validated with spiked wheat samples and showed a detection limit of 0.07 ng / ml with a range of 0.78 - 8.74 ng / ml. a different ec aptasensor was described by tong et al .
( 2011 ) [ 135 ] .
herein a dna partly complementary to the ota aptamer was bound to aunp for hybridization of the aptamer .
binding of ota dissociates the aptamer - ota complex .
they achieved a detection limit of 1.0 pg / ml and a range of 0.005 - 10.0 ng / ml. this aptasensor was validated with spiked and real wheat starch samples in comparison with an elisa .
an aptasensor based on conformational change of aptamer induced by binding of ota leading to aggregation of the aunp used for aptamer coupling was described by yang et al .
( 2011 ) [ 136 ] .
here a detection limit of 2.5 nm with a range of 20 - 625 nm was obtained .
dnazyme was applied in the aptasensor developed by yang et al .
( 2012 ) [ 137 ] .
binding of ota to aptamer induced hairpin opening resulting in enzyme activity of hrp - mimicking dnazyme and oxidation of tmb , which could by measured colorimetrically .
signalling using quantum dots ( qd ) was applied in a fluorescent strip sensor , wherein qd were conjugated to ota aptamer and the conjugates applied to strips similar to lf - ia. after the reaction the reading is visually with a limit of detection of 5 ng / ml within 10 min , and 1.9 ng / ml when using image analysis software for a calibration curve in spiked red wine samples .
the results were compared to hplc for confirmation .
6. immunoaffinity chromatography a long used application of antibodies is in immunochromatography for the capture , isolation and / or concentration of target compounds .
in this case an antibody is covalently coupled to a solid support ( e.g. , functionalized agarose , sepharose , silica ) and transferred into a column .
when sample containing target compound is passed through the column , the target compound will bind to the antibody and may be eluted after washings that remove unwanted matrix components .
an elution volume smaller than the sample volume , allows for concentration of the target compound .
commercial iac columns are available for many target compounds , including ota , and used as a purification means before further analysis ( hplc , ms , elisa ) .
a combination of iac and immunoassay for ota in one column was developed by the group of van peteghem ( ghent university ) in cooperation with the saratov state university ( moscow ) .
initially , the column consisted of a layer of antibody - coupled solid support upon a clean - up layer .
ota - hrp was used for the competitive immunochemical reaction that was detected with tmb and visually evaluated .
in samples of roasted coffee [ 138 ] and spices [ 139 ] a cut - off value of 6 microg / kg and 10 microg / ml , respectively , was demonstrated. by using two different antibody containing layers in a similar iac column both ota and aflatoxin b1 could be detected in spices [ 140 ] .
as for the analysis of red wine the cut - off value according to eu legislation is lower than for coffee or spices , the method was optimized to a lower sensitivity ( 2 microg / l ) .
in this embodiment a separate clean - up column was placed upon a flow - through column containing antibody [ 141 ] , and further designed for the simultaneous detection of 2,4,6 - trichlorophenol and ota in red wine or spices [ 142,143 ] at a level of 2 microg / l and 10 microg / kg , respectively .
immunoaffinity extraction in a different setting has been described by aqai ( 2011 ) [ 102 ] .
herein monoclonal anti - ota antibody was coated onto magnetic beads for the capture as well as identification of the target compound in competition with ota - pe. detection in wheat and cereal sample extracts was performed by flow cytometry ( see above ) and compared to lc - ms. chemical antibodies have also been used for ota extraction and analysis .
however , due to low recoveries onto mip , specific extraction had to be preceded by spe extraction to remove interfering substances .
analysis included lc - ms / ms. aptamer as selective capturing moiety in an affinity column for the determination of ota in wheat grain has been described [ 132 ] .
analysis of eluted samples was performed with fluorescence spectrometry .
due to the lower affinity in comparison to antibodies , the sensitivity of this method was in the ppb range .
7. summary when monitoring for the presence of ota either in raw and derived agricultural products , there is a large choice of methods .
depending on the purpose , either rapid detection or validation according to the regulations , one can use quantitative and qualitative methods .
among the available conventional methods , hplc , and among the immunochemical methods , elisa have traditionally been applied .
if performed according to the iso norms , elisa may be considered as equipotential to the conventional methods , with comparable sensitivity and the advantage the several samples may be analyzed in the same run .
many researchers have developed and designed in - house antibodies and elisa .
however , commercially available kits have the advantage of avoiding long development which can take a few months .
in the course of time there have been successful attempts to improve the elisa with regard to sensitivity and analysis time .
first , the tracer was changed from enzyme plus chromofore to fluorofore .
the advantages of using fluorofores are : an improved sensitivity may be achieved ; by applying different fluorofores a multi - analyte assay may be designed ( tr - fia ) ; and even homogeneous immunoassays are possible , avoiding washing and separation steps ( fp - ia , fret ( label - free )) .
disadvantages of fluorescent assays are that background fluorescence may interfere and should be eliminated , and the required equipment is more expensive .
chemiluminescent immunoassay is a variant of elisa wherein a comparable enzyme is combined with luminol and an enhancer .
cl - ia is a rather new technique for ota detection , but due to a high sensitivity ( 0.01 ng / ml ) and applicability for screening purposes , cl - ia looks promising .
advanced label - free detection methods include biosensors such as spr ( optical ) or gravimetric immunosensors , wherein the binding of antigen to antibody is detected by a change in plasmon resonance or mass .
spr may be performed in direct and indirect format and can easily be used for multi - analyte analysis .
improvements include the use of au - nanoparticles enabling detection limits down to 0.06 ng / ml. despite the usefulness , spr equipment is quite expensive .
depending on the number of steps and costs , electrochemical immunosensors may be a good alternative for rapid detection of ota in various matrices .
qualitative detection methods include membrane - based immunoassays , lateral flow systems and iac columns .
each of these is commercially available and may be used for a rapid screening of samples .
reading is visual , although the results may be quantitative when using appropriate devices , such as a scanner .
improvements in strip tests were achieved when using au - nanoparticles and multi - analyte detection , for example , ota and zearelanone have been described .
immunoassay on iac columns is a useful variant of iac that may be used in the field for both single - and multi - analyte detection .
mycotoxins , including ota , may be detected at the cut - off level according to eu legislation in different matrices .
the advantage of these quantitative methods is the ease and rapidity of performance .
a recent development in analysis includes chemical / synthetic antibodies , mips and aptamers .
mips are polymers forming a kind of binding pocket for a particular target compound .
at first , mips have proven useful to extraction purposes in spe - like columns .
an mip for zearelanone applied in a sensor has been described in a review about mips for environmental application and production of an mip - based sensor for ota is probably only a question of time .
aptamers are oligonucleotides resembling antibodies in selectivity and affinity .
they are selected from libraries and used for extraction of ota , enzyme - linked aptamer assays ( elaa ) , strip tests , and aptasensors .
improvement of the elaa by using au - nanoparticles gave a detection limit of 0.07 ng / ml. aptasensors show an even lower detection limit of 1.0 pg / ml in wheat samples in an embodiment using partly complimentary dna .
a rapid strip test using quantum dots for labeling of ota and fluorescent detection showed a detection limit of 5 ng / ml in visual reading and 1.9 ng / ml with a scanner .
the assay time in this case was very short ( 10 min ) .
aptamers have the advantage that the oligonucleotides , once selected and validated , may be synthesized in large amounts as required .
in conclusion , there is a wide range of immunochemical methods for ota detection which are widely available or easy to design .
depending on the user 's detection purposes and resources , the most appropriate method may be chosen .

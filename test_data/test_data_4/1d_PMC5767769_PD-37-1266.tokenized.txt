2017 ; 37 : 1266 - 1267 . https :// doi.org / 10.1002 / pd.5170 29271028 in a recent edition of prenatal diagnosis , we published a comparison between bioinformatic methods that estimate the fetal cell - free dna fraction in maternal plasma , which is essential knowledge when performing nipt tests.1 grendar et al confirmed the need for this paper , but commented on our findings by stating that we left data unexplored , mainly pointing towards observable biases between the different approaches ( ie , deviation from the 45o line through the origin in pairwise comparisons ). 2 clearly , these systematic differences can be observed ( an updated figure showing this effect more clearly , as well as a table containing the underlying data are included as new supplementary data ) .
however , since there is no gold standard available ( ie , the true fetal fraction is unknown ) , nor is it ( easily ) faithfully extractable , it is not possible to confirm which bias is to be preferred .
therefore , we decided not to zoom in on this level of comparison , but to restrict to conclusions of a more general nature .
mainly , we compared three methods : y chromosome - based methods ( defrag , bayindr ) , a different method based on all chromosomes ( seqff ) , and one based on fragment lengths of the cell - free dna ( sanefalcon ) .
as y - based methods for pregnancies with male fetuses are likely closest to the truth ( due to the absence of the y in the mother ) , looking at correlations with the no - y - based methods makes sense ( this is also not argued by grendar et al ) .
this comparison shows that the no - y - based methods are more variable , and consequently have a lower correlation to the y - based methods .
yet , in contrast to y - based methods , they can still be used for pregnancies carrying female fetuses , as their correlation is still good (> 0.9 for seqff ) .
within the y - based methods , we also compared whether focusing on uniquely mapping male regions on y would increase reliability ( differences between the a / b methods for both defrag and bayindir ) .
bayindir is especially sensitive for this difference , with bayindira ( not focusing on male regions ) having the largest variations in addition to nonzero fetal fractions for female pregnancies .
we therefore concluded that focusing on uniquely mappable y regions is preferable .
the correlation between defragb and bayindirb is high ( 0.984 ) , resulting in our main conclusion to use any y - based method for male - pregnancies .
zooming in on the differences between both methods , we see a minor systematic difference , with defragb resulting in slightly higher estimates of the fetal fraction than bayindirb ( figure 1 in our manuscript ) .
as stated before , in the absence of a gold standard , there is no way to tell which one is better , which prompted us to the more general conclusion on using any y - based method .
grendar et al , claim that these systematic differences ( on the order of 2.5 %) make a huge difference when used in the nipt procedure .
granted , if we would have implied that the estimates are unbiased estimates of the real fractions , this difference is important .
but , we did not claim this .
in fact , we argue that the remark by grendar et al is deceptive .
first , the difference is artificial ( when not knowing the true values ) .
second , and more importantly , in practice one can easily adapt decision thresholds to these differences .
for nipt this would result in shifting the decision threshold with 2.5 % between the two methods when deciding on having enough fetal dna to reliably interpret nipt results .
taken together ; the claims we made are supported by the correlations ; systematic biases are present as grendar et al rightly pointed out , but they cannot be interpreted and can easily be accounted for in clinical practice ; the accuracy of the estimates of the fetal fraction is not known due to lack of a gold standard , but for clinical practice this is not essential .
figure 1 the lower left part of the matrix shows our comparison of the 6 different methods to predict fetal fraction from single - read ngs data for 654 maternal blood plasma samples .
blue dots represent the male pregnancies ; red dots , the female pregnancies .
gray and green dots represent male and female pregnancies of a failed run , which contained degraded fetal dna .
on the diagonal of the matrix , the correlations to bmi ( b ) , weight ( w ) , and the gestational age ( g ) are shown , respectively .
a diagonal line has been included in all lower left panels to indicate systematic differences .
the upper right part of the matrix shows the correlation between the 2 methods [ colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ] supporting information data s1 .

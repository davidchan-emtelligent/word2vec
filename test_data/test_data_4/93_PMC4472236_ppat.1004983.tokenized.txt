prions propagate as multiple strains in a wide variety of mammalian species .
the detection of all such strains by a single ultrasensitive assay such as real time quaking - induced conversion ( rt - quic ) would facilitate prion disease diagnosis , surveillance and research .
previous studies have shown that bank voles , and transgenic mice expressing bank vole prion protein , are susceptible to most , if not all , types of prions .
here we show that bacterially expressed recombinant bank vole prion protein ( residues 23 - 230 ) is an effective substrate for the sensitive rt - quic detection of all of the different prion types that we have tested so far - a total of 28 from humans , cattle , sheep , cervids and rodents , including several that have previously been undetectable by rt - quic or protein misfolding cyclic amplification .
furthermore , comparison of the relative abilities of different prions to seed positive rt - quic reactions with bank vole and not other recombinant prion proteins allowed discrimination of prion strains such as classical and atypical l - type bovine spongiform encephalopathy , classical and atypical nor98 scrapie in sheep , and sporadic and variant creutzfeldt - jakob disease in humans .
comparison of protease - resistant rt - quic conversion products also aided strain discrimination and suggested the existence of several distinct classes of prion templates among the many strains tested .
author summary prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders that propagate as multiple strains in a variety of mammalian species .
the detection of all such prion types by a single ultrasensitive assay , such as the real time quaking - induced conversion ( rt - quic ) assay , would facilitate prion disease diagnosis , surveillance , and research .
here we show detection of minute amounts of 28 different prion types from humans , cattle , sheep , cervids and rodents , some of which were previously undetectable , using a single recombinant bank vole prion protein substrate .
we also demonstrate the generation of prion type - dependent rt - quic conversion products which may help with prion strain discrimination and the characterization of distinct classes of prion templates .
finally , we describe a practical strategy for prion strain discrimination , e.g. classical and atypical l - type bovine spongiform encephalopathy ; classical and atypical nor98 sheep scrapie ; and human sporadic and variant creutzfeldt - jakob disease .
thus , our study provides a basis for wide - ranging prion detection and strain discrimination .

introduction prion diseases , or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , are neurodegenerative disorders that include creutzfeldt - jakob disease ( cjd ) , gerstmann - straussler - scheincker syndrome ( gss ) , fatal familial insomnia ( ffi ) and sporadic fatal insomnia ( sfi ) in humans , bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) in cattle , scrapie in sheep , and chronic wasting disease ( cwd ) in cervids .
the origin of prion diseases can be infectious , genetic or sporadic .
many prion diseases also have subtypes or strains that can be distinguished based on the prnp ( prion protein ) genotype , transmission characteristics , clinical manifestations , neuropathological lesion profiles and / or biochemical properties of the disease - associated forms of prion protein ( prpd ) [ 1 - 9 ] .
prpd , or a subset thereof , is the predominant molecular component of the infectious agent , or prion , which propagates itself by inducing misfolding of the hosts' normal protease - sensitive prion protein , prpc or prpsen , into additional prpd .
this propagation mechanism appears to involve seeded , or templated , polymerization in which the given prpd conformation is imposed upon normally monomeric prpsen molecules as they are recruited into growing prpd multimers [ 3,4 ] .
prpd usually includes forms called prpres that , unlike the normal prpsen , are partially resistant to digestion by proteinase k ( pk ) .
the banding pattern of prpres in immunoblots can vary distinctively depending on the prion strain , host species and / or prnp genotype. with most prion diseases the predominant 21 - 32 - kda variably glycosylated prpres fragments observed on immunoblots extend from ragged n - termini between residues ~ 80 - 96 to the gpi - anchored c - terminus ( e.g. , at residue 231 in humans ) .
in contrast , the prpres associated with sheep nor98 scrapie and human gss linked to the p102l , f198s , a117v and h187r prnp mutations include much smaller 6 - 14 kda bands [ 10 - 12 ] .
these bands are internal fragments with ragged n - and c - termini within residues ~ 80 - ~ 160 [ 13 ] .
in cases of p102l gss , brain tissue from some individuals can also give 21 - 32 kda prpres bands with the 7 - 8 kda bands , while others give the 21 - 32 kda prpres bands but lack the 7 - 8 kda bands .
hereafter , we will refer to the former cases as gss p102l * and the latter as gss p102l .
a major challenge for the prion disease field is the development of sufficiently practical and sensitive tests for routine prion disease detection and strain discrimination in medicine , agriculture , wildlife management and research .
the real time quaking induced conversion ( rt - quic ) assay , which is based on prion - seeded fibrillization of recombinant prion protein ( rprpsen ) , is known to be highly specific and ultra - sensitive for detection of multiple human and animal prion diseases [ 14 - 20 ] .
moreover , like the amyloid seeding assay [ 21 ] , rt - quic is more practical than comparably ultra - sensitive assays by being relatively rapid and based on a 96 - well plate format with fluorescence readout [ 14,16 ] .
appropriate combinations of prion type and rprpsen substrate have been important in the performance of various rt - quic assays [ 14,18 - 20,22 - 25 ] .
for several types of prion disease , however , no effective rprpsen substrate has been identified ; these types include human gss arising from p102l * , f198s , a117v and h187r prnp mutations and the atypical sheep scrapie strain nor98 .
moreover , no single substrate has yet been shown to detect all of the different prion variants of humans , cattle , sheep , cervids and rodents .
one potential rprpsen substrate that has not been described for rt - quic assays is based on the bank vole sequence .
bank voles [ 26 ] , and transgenic mice that express bank vole ( bv ) prpsen [ 27 ] , are susceptible to an unusually wide range of prion strains from different species .
furthermore , prpsen in bank vole brain tissue homogenates is a broadly reactive , but not universal , substrate for the highly sensitive protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( pmca ) assay for prions [ 28 ] .
here we have tested the suitability of recombinant bank vole prpsen ( bv rprpsen ) , when expressed in e. coli and purified , as an rt - quic substrate .
we have found so far that bv rprpsen is a universally effective substrate for multiple prion strains from multiple species , and , most notably , for prions for which no effective substrate has been available .
furthermore , we have found that bv rprpsen - based rt - quic reactions give strain - dependent pk - resistant products in a manner that should further facilitate prion strain discrimination .
results lack of detection of gss and atypical scrapie subtypes associated with 6 - 14 kda prpres fragments using previously described rprpsen constructs most mammalian prpres types with predominant 21 - 32 kda prpres bands can seed thioflavin t - positive ( tht ) amyloid formation in rt - quic reactions [ 17,22,29 - 32 ] using at least one of the following substrates : syrian golden hamster rprpsen residues 90 - 231 [ 14,30,31 ] , syrian golden hamster rprpsen 23 - 231 [ 18 ] , human rprpsen 23 - 231 [ 16 ] , murine rprpsen 23 - 231 [ 24 ] or hamster - sheep chimeric rprpsen 23 - 231 [ 19,22 ] .
for example , detection of human p102l gss brain tissue using hamster rprpsen 90 - 231 is shown in fig 1 .
however , to date , no detection of rt - quic seeding activity has been reported using these rprpsen substrates with cases of human gss or sheep scrapie that give prominent low molecular weight prpres fragments in immunoblots , despite extensive efforts .
specifically , these cases include human gss with the f198s , a117v or h187r mutations and sheep nor98 scrapie types giving 6 - 14 kda prpres fragments [ 10 - 13 ] , and the human p102l - gss with an ~ 8 kda prpres fragment ( p102l *) [ 10 ] .
our inability to detect these prion types is exemplified in fig 1 using 10 - 3 brain tissue dilutions of human gss f198s and p102l * and sheep nor98 scrapie with the hamster rprpsen 90 - 231 .
in contrast , p102l gss ( without the ~ 8 - kda fragment ) gave positive reactions with 1,000,000 - fold smaller amounts of brain tissue .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1004983.g001 fig 1 rt - quic detection of gss p102l and lack of detection for gss f198s , p102l * and sheep atypical nor98 scrapie using hamster rprpsen 90 - 231 .
serial dilutions ( 10 - 6 to 10 - 9 ) of gss p102l brain tissue dilutions were used to seed quadruplicate rt - quic reactions ( red lines ) with hamster 90 - 231 rprpsen as the substrate , 300mm nacl , 0.002 % sds .
the same rprpsen and rt - quic conditions listed above were used in reactions seeded with the designated brain tissue dilutions of gss human patients with f198s ( green line ) or p102l * ( gray line ) prnp point mutations , alzheimer 's disease ( ad , blue line ) , sheep without prion disease ( blue line ) or with nor98 scrapie ( orange line ) .
average tht fluorescence readings from replicate wells for each type of sample were plotted as a function of time .
results are representative of similar findings from at least 10 independent experiments using hamster 90 - 231 , hamster 23 - 231 , human or hamster - sheep chimeric rprpsen substrates .
detection of gss f198s and a117v prion seeding activity using bv rprpsen we then tested bank vole rprpsen residues 23 - 230 ( bv rprpsen ) as a substrate to detect seeding activity of two human prion subtypes that have not been detectable previously by rt - quic , namely f198s - and a117v - gss .
concurrently , we varied two parameters that we have shown to be influential , namely the concentrations of nacl [ 14 ] and sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) [ 30 ] .
each reaction was seeded with 10 - 4 dilutions of frontal cortex brain tissue from confirmed gss cases carrying either the f198s or a117v mutation of the prion protein gene .
we found that our standard concentrations of sds ( 0.002 %) in combination with either 130 or 300mm nacl failed to allow a distinction in lag phase between prion positive and uninfected brain homogenate ( bh ) seeded reactions ( fig 2a and 2b ) .
lowering the sds concentration to 0.001 % with either 130 or 300mm nacl improved this distinction between prion positive and uninfected bh seeded reactions ( fig 2c and 2d ) .
however , using final concentrations of 300 mm nacl and 0.001 % sds , provided much shorter lag phases in reactions seeded with the two gss subtypes than with the cerebral ischemia negative control ( fig 2d ) .
these results indicated that under these latter rt - quic conditions bv rprpsen detected seeding activity associated with prpd conformers that had not otherwise been detectable by rt - quic or pmca prion seed amplification techniques [ 33 ] .

quadruplicate rt - quic reactions were seeded with 10 - 4 dilutions of human frontal cortex brain tissue from gss patients with the p102l ( red lines ) , f198s ( green lines ) , or a117v ( magenta lines ) prnp mutation .
negative control reaction were seeded with 10 - 4 dilutions of frontal cortex brain tissue from a cerebral ischemia patient ( blue lines ) .
a final sds concentration of 0.002 % ( a and b ) or 0.001 % ( c and d ) in combination with 130 mm ( a and c ) or 300 mm ( b and d ) nacl were used with bv rprpsen .
similar results were seen in three independent experiments .
traces from representative rt - quic experiments are the average of four replicate wells .
next , we assessed the sensitivity of this new rt - quic assay for detecting gss - associated prion seeding activity .
reactions were seeded with 10 - 4 to 10 - 9 dilutions of brain tissue from gss patients carrying the p102l , p102l * , a117v , f198s and h187r mutation of the prion gene ( fig 3a - 3e ) .
a reaction time cutoff of 50h was chosen because in more than 20 independent rt - quic experiments seeded with negative control alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) or cerebral ischemia brain homogenates , no positive rt - quic reactions were observed until after 55h ( in rare wells ) .
we detected gss p102l , p102l * , a117v and f198s and h187r prion seeding activity in as little as 10 - 9 , 10 - 4 , 10 - 8 , 10 - 8 and 10 - 6 dilutions of brain ( frontal cortex ) tissue dilutions , respectively ( fig 3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1004983.g003 fig 3 rt - quic sensitivity for detection of human gss p102l , p102l * , a117v , f198s , and h187r seeding activity using bv rprpsen .
the designated dilutions of frontal cortex brain tissue from the designated gss p102l ( a ) , p102l * ( b ) , a117v ( c ) , f198s ( d ) , and h187r ( e ) patients were used to seed rt - quic reactions with 0.001 % sds and 300mm nacl .
negative control reactions were seeded with alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) brain tissue ( a - e , blue lines ) .
representative data from one of three independent experiments is shown as the averages of fluorescence values from four replicate wells .
detection of 28 different prion types / strains of human , sheep , cattle , deer , elk , mouse and hamster using bv rprpsen after finding that bv rprpsen supported rt - quic detection of prion seeding activity from previously undetectable types of gss , we tested whether bv rprpsen could be used to detect other types of prion diseases .
we tested 28 different types of prions in brain tissue from humans , sheep , mouse , hamster , cattle , elk , and deer ( tables 1 and 2 ) and found that all of them gave faster and stronger positive tht fluorescence responses than a variety of uninfected negative control brain specimens ( fig 4 ) .
among the 28 were the five prion types that have not been detectable by rt - quic under other conditions , namely human gss f198s , a117v , h187r , and p102l * and sheep nor98 scrapie ( fig 4 , red traces ) .
these results indicated that under these conditions , bv rprpsen is the most broadly prion - seeded rt - quic substrate described to date .

equivalent dilutions of species - and brain region - matched samples from uninfected individuals were used as specificity controls ( green ) .

1chronic wasting disease prion strain / type - dependent rt - quic products from reactions using bv rprpsen prion strain - dependence has not been observed previously in the immunoblot banding profile of pk - treated recombinant prpres ( rprpres ) products of rt - quic reactions .
however , using bv rprpsen we observed consistently distinct products of rt - quic reactions seeded with different types of human prions ( fig 5 and table 1 ) .
the observed banding patterns could be grouped based on the type of seed : gss cases ( f198s , a117v , h187r ) with the ~ 8 - 14 kda protease - resistant bands and sfi gave 2 bands : a major ~ 10kda band and a ~ 6 - 9kda band ; the gss ( p102l ) , gcjd ( e200k , v210i , six octarepeat insertion ) , and the iatrogenic cjd ( icjd ) cases with ~ 21 - 32 kda prpres bands gave multiple bands with a major ~ 12 kda band and multiple minor bands between ~ 6 - 10 kda ; variant cjd , gss ( p102l *) and ffi ( d178n ) cases gave a single predominant band at ~ 10 kda ; and sporadic cjd in some cases gave two bands between ~ 10 - 12 kda , while in other cases gave a predominant band at ~ 10 kda .
repeated analyses (> 4 ) of individual scjd cases indicated that they consistently seeded the formation of only one or the other of the latter two rprpres products .
this observation provided evidence that the different scjd - seeded rprpres products were dictated by differential templating activity in the tissue samples rather than stochastic events during the rt - quic reaction .
additionally , because these immunoblots used an antiserum to the c - terminus of prp , the fragments likely differed primarily at their n - termini .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1004983.g005 fig 5 western blot of bv rprpres products from rt - quic reactions seeded with various human prion types .
reaction products were digested with 10mug / ml of pk. immunoblots were probed with the c - terminal antibody r20 ( hamster prp epitope residues 218 - 231 ) .
molecular mass ( mm ) is indicated in kilodaltons .
immunoblots are representative of one biological replicate ( n = total biological replicates tested ) each giving rprpres banding profiles similar to that / those shown .
(#) samples for which cerebellum , frontal cortex , basal ganglia and thalamus from the same patient were analyzed .
a minimum of two sets of rt - quic bank vole rprpres products were generated from a given prion type and independently subjected to immunoblotting analysis .
we further compared the bv rprpres products of reactions seeded with different rodent , bovine , cervine and ovine prion strains ( table 2 ) .
as with the human prion seeds , we observed distinct strain - dependent bv rprpres banding profiles from reactions seeded with different prion types .
mouse 22l scrapie - seeded bv rprpres products consistently showed a ~ 10 and ~ 12 kda pk - resistant band , whereas bv rprpres products from reactions seeded with chandler , me7 , 87v and anchorless 22l ( 22l gpi - ) scrapie displayed a predominant ~ 10 kda band ( fig 6a ) .
the lack of the gpi anchor in the 22l gpi - scrapie seed resulted in an rt - quic product that was distinct from the wild - type gpi - anchored 22l scrapie .
additionally , closely related hamster prion strains ( hyper and 263k ; fig 6b ) showed similar bv rprpres banding profiles (~ 10 and ~ 12 kda pk - resistant bands ) which were distinct from the drowsy - seeded bv rprpres products ( primarily a ~ 10 kda band ; fig 6b ) .
deer and elk cwd - seeded reactions each gave ~ 8 , 9 , 10 , and 12 kda bands , but differed in the relative intensities of the top two bands between the two ( fig 6c ) .
furthermore , distinct strain - dependent bv rprpres banding profiles were observed between classical ( c - bse ) and atypical ( l - bse ) (~ 10 kda vs. ~ 9 , 10 , and 12 kda bands , respectively ; fig 6c ) , as well as between classical and atypical nor98 sheep scrapie (~ 10 kda vs. ~ 9 , 10 , and 12 kda bands , respectively ; fig 6d ) .
collectively , these immunoblotting results suggested that certain human and animal prion diseases can be discriminated in part based on analysis of the rprpres products of bv rprpsen - based rt - quic reactions .

pk - treated rt - quic products from mouse ( a ) , hamster ( b ) , cattle ( c ) , deer ( c ) , elk ( c ) and sheep ( d ) prion seeds were probed with r20 ( hamster prp epitope residues 218 - 231 ) .
in ( d ) , the classical scrapie - seeded reactions include those seeded with samples from prnp vrq / vrq and arq / arq sheep ( not designated ) .
the nor98 - seeded reactions were seeded with samples from arr / arr , arq / ahq and arq / arq sheep .
rt - quic reactions and immunoblotting analysis for each of these types of prions were performed at least twice with similar results .
the banding profiles shown are representative of multiple ( n ) independently tested biological replicates .
detection and discrimination of classical and atypical bse using bv and hamster rprpsen substrates we previously reported that classical and atypical l - type bse strains can be discriminated on the basis of relative rt - quic reactivities with hamster rprpsen 90 - 231 and hamster - sheep chimeric rprpsen 23 - 231 substrates [ 22 ] .
here we found that bv rprpsen can similarly detect both classical and l - type bse , providing an alternative substrate for discrimination between the two bovine strains .
specifically , detection of seeding activity with bv rprpsen ( fig 7 ) but not with three other rprpsen substrates that detected only l - type bse , namely human 23 - 231 , hamster 23 - 231 or hamster 90 - 231 [ 22 ] , can be used to differentiate these two bovine prion types .

discrimination of classical and nor98 sheep scrapie using bv and hamster - sheep chimeric rprpsen substrates having detected nor98 sheep scrapie with bv rprpsen , ( fig 4 ) we tested whether a strategy similar to the one described above for c - vs. l - type bse using different rprpsen substrates would allow discrimination of nor98 and classical sheep scrapie .
brain tissue from eight sheep with classical scrapie [ arq / arq ( n = 6 ) , vrq / vrq ( n = 2 ) prp genotypes , table 2 ] were readily detected using the hamster - sheep chimeric rprpsen 23 - 231 within ~ 40hs ( fig 8a ) .
however , brain tissue from eight cases of nor98 scrapie [ arr / ahq ( n = 1 ) , arq / arq ( n = 4 ) , arq / ahq ( n = 2 ) and arr / arr ( n = 1 ) genotypes , table 2 ] gave no positive responses using the same substrate ( fig 8b ) .
in contrast , consistent with the results in fig 4 , seven of these cases gave positive responses when bv rprpsen was used in reactions seeded with 10 - 4 brain tissue dilutions ( fig 8a - 8e , orange lines ) and those that were weaker or not detected were positive when seeded with 10 - 3 dilutions ( fig 8a - 8e , red lines ) .
to compare the sensitivities of the assay for detection of classical and atypical scrapie using these two substrates , we diluted representative brain homogenates from classical and nor98 scrapie positive sheep ( fig 8g - 8j ) and tested them using both bv and ha - s rprpsen .
we detected classical scrapie down to 10 - 8 dilutions using ha - s rprpsen and down to 10 - 6 using bv rprpsen .
consistent with the data in fig 8 , no fluorescence increases were seen in reactions seeded with the same dilutions of a nor98 atypical scrapie sample when using ha - s rprpsen .
in contrast , parallel reactions with bv rprpsen gave positive reactions when seeded with nor98 brain dilutions down to 10 - 6 - 10 - 7 , indicating that bv rprpsen is ~ 1,000 - fold more sensitive at detecting nor98 scrapie than is ha - s rprpsen .
collectively , these results suggest that if an ovine brain sample gives a positive rt - quic response with bv rprpsen , it should give a stronger positive reaction with ha - s rprpsen if it contains classical scrapie , but a negative , or at least much weaker , reaction if it contains nor98 scrapie .

rt - quic reactions were seeded with dilutions of cerebellum or cerebral cortex from uninfected , classical or nor98 atypical scrapie positive sheep .
the nor98 ( arr / ahq , arq / arq , arq / ahq and arr / arr prnp genotypes ) reactions were seeded with 10 - 4 ( orange ) brain tissue dilutions .
additional 10 - 3 ( red ) brain tissue dilutions are also shown for weaker samples .
classical sheep scrapie brain tissue from eight animals ( arq / arq , vrq / vrq prnp genotypes ) was diluted 10 - 4 ( green , a and d ) .
equivalent dilutions of cerebellum or frontal cortex brain tissue dilutions ( arq / arq prnp genotypes ) were used as specificity controls ( blue , c and f ) .
either ha - s rprpsen ( 300mm nacl and 0.002 % sds ; a - c ) or bv rprpsen ( 300mm nacl and 0.001 % sds ; d - f ) were used as substrates .
brain homogenates from classical scrapie positive sheep ( green , vrq / vrq ) and atypical nor98 scrapie positive sheep ( orange , arr / ahq ) were serially diluted ( 10 - 4 to 10 - 8 ) for rt - quic analysis using ha - s rprpsen with 300mm nacl and 0.002 % sds ( g and h ) or bv rprpsen with 300mm nacl and 0.001 % sds ( i and j ) substrates .

detection and discrimination of human scjd and vcjd using bv and hamster 23 - 231 rprpsen substrates to investigate the discrimination of two non - genetic human prion strains , we tested 10 - 4 brain tissue dilutions from two confirmed cases of type 1 scjd ( fig 9a and 9b , cases a and b , green lines ) and two cases of vcjd ( fig 9a and 9b , cases c and d , orange lines ) .
we used previously described sds conditions ( 0.002 % final concentration of sds ; [ 23 ]) with hamster 23 - 231 rprpsen , and 0.001 % sds with bv rprpsen , both in the presence of 300mm nacl .
we observed rapid amplification of prion seeding activity in the two type 1 scjd samples when using either hamster 23 - 231 or bv rprpsen ( fig 9a and 9b ) .
our detection of the scjd samples with the hamster 23 - 231 substrate was consistent with previous demonstrations that all scjd subtypes are detectable with this substrate [ 23,30,34 ] .
no increase in tht fluorescence was seen in vcjd - seeded hamster 23 - 231 rprpsen rt - quic reactions ( fig 9a ) .
however , in accordance with the results shown in fig 4 , seeding activity was detected in both vcjd samples using bv rprpsen ( fig 9b ) .
thus , sporadic and variant cjd sample were discriminated by differential reactivities with the bv and hamster 23 - 231 rprpsen substrates .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1004983.g009 fig 9 detection , discrimination and sensitivities for detection of human scjd and vcjd with hamster 23 - 231 and bv rprpsen substrates .
dilutions ( 10 - 4 ) of frontal cortex brain tissue from two confirmed scjd ( case a and b , green ) and two vcjd cases ( case c and d , orange ) were used to seed rt - quic reactions .
testing was performed using either hamster ( 23 - 231 ) in the presence of 300mm nacl and 0.002 % sds ( a ) or bv prpsen in the presence of 300mm nacl and 0.001 % sds ( b ) .
brain homogenates from one scjd ( case a ) and one vcjd ( case c ) patient were serially diluted ( 10 - 5 to 10 - 8 ) for rt - quic analysis .
hamster 23 - 231 ( c and e ) and bv rprpsen ( d and f ) were used as a substrate .
these samples were tested in three independent experiments with similar results .
traces represent the averages of four replicate wells .
next we compared the rt - quic sensitivities for detection of scjd and vcjd brain homogenates using hamster and bv rprpsen .
we performed end - point dilution rt - quic analysis of brain tissue from scjd ( case a ) and vcjd ( case c ) ( fig 9c - 9f , green and orange lines , respectively ) .
we detected scjd down to 10 - 8 / 10 - 9 with hamster 23 - 231 rprpsen , ( fig 9c ) and 10 - 8 with bv rprpsen ( fig 9d ) .
although scjd gave slightly slower amplification kinetics with hamster 23 - 231 rprpsen ( fig 9c ) compared to bv rprpsen ( fig 9d ) , the overall sensitivities using the two substrates were comparable .
in contrast , markedly different sensitivities were observed with the two substrates in the vcjd - seeded reactions .
specifically , only weak seeding activity was occasionally detected in 10 - 4 or 10 - 5 brain dilutions with hamster 23 - 231 rprpsen ( representative data in fig 9e ) , but fast and sensitive detection of vcjd seeding activity down to 10 - 7 brain tissue dilution was observed using bv rprpsen ( fig 9f ) .
these results suggest that bv rprpsen is 100 - 10,000 - fold more sensitive than hamster 23 - 231 rprpsen in detecting vcjd brain derived prion seeding activity .
collectively , these findings further support the potential broad applicability of a bv rprpsen prion discrimination strategy to a variety of prion types .
discussion the lack of practical and cost - effective tests that are sensitive enough to detect the lowest infectious levels of prions has long been a major impediment in coping with prion diseases .
rapid commercially available immunoassays have allowed post - mortem detection of prion infections in high - titered tissues such as brain or lymphoid tissues , but diagnostic specimens that are most readily accessible in living hosts , such as blood , csf and nasal brushings , have much lower prion titers that are undetectable with these assays .
in contrast , rt - quic assays have been highly effective in detecting prion seeding activity in such low - titered specimens , and are being widely implemented as state - of - the - art diagnostic tests for humans and animals [ 16,18 - 20,25,34 - 37 ] .
moreover , recent improvements have increased the speed and sensitivity of rt - quic assays such that scjd testing based on human csf samples can now be performed in a matter of hours rather than days [ 30 ] .
in our experience , the most demanding and costly requirement for rt - quic testing is the availability of suitable rprpsen substrates .
prior to the present study , testing facilities would typically have to produce or procure multiple rprpsen sequences to be able to test for multiple prion types .
however , we have now shown that all of the prion diseases that we have tested so far from humans and other mammals can be detected sensitively by using bv rprpsen ( fig 4 ) .
this provides a useful platform for broad - based prion detection and strain discrimination .
thus , we envision that most initial screening for the presence of a wide variety of prions could be performed using bv rprpsen .
once a prion - infected sample from a given host species is identified , one could then often discriminate between strains by targeted use of another rprpsen substrate that is known to be differentially sensitive to seeding by prion strains of that host species ( figs 7 - 9 ) and / or by performing immunoblots of the pk - resistant rt - quic products of the reactions ( figs 5 and 6 ) .
although we have demonstrated detection of a wide variety of prion types , the relative sensitivities of bv rprpsen - based rt - quic for brain homogenates of hosts with different prion diseases is presumably dependent on the concentrations of prpd in the tissue samples .
clearly prpd concentrations may vary markedly between individuals and different regions of the brain as a function of strain .
furthermore , because prpd can vary markedly in its properties , e.g. amyloid vs. non - amyloid , protease - sensitive vs. resistant , small vs. large particles , infectious vs. non - infectious , it is probable that the rt - quic seeding activity will vary per unit prpd between different prion strains and tissue sources .
thus , although we have shown the potential for bv rprpsen - based rt - quic to detect and help discriminate prion strains , much additional work with each type of prion and sample type will be required to better establish the quantitative relationships between rt - quic seeding activity and the levels of various types of prpd in different tissues of diagnostic or scientific interest .
since the inception of prion - seeded cell - free prp conversion reactions [ 38 ] , striking sequence - and strain - specificities have been observed that appeared to correlate , at least largely , with transmission barriers and strain phenotypes of prion diseases in vivo [ 3,39 - 41 ] .
indeed , sequence differences of as little as a single residue between the prpd seed and prpsen substrate can block prpres formation in such cell - free reactions [ 42 ] , as it can in scrapie - infected cells [ 43 ] and in vivo [ 44 ] .
however , rt - quic assays have tended to be less constrained by such sequence differences [ 14 ] .
we reason that this is due in part to the fact that in rt - quic reactions , it is only the c - terminal residues ~ 160 - 231 of the substrate molecules that must refold into the pk - resistant amyloid core [ 45 ] to give a positive reaction , i.e. , an increase in tht fluorescence .
in contrast , earlier cell - free conversion [ 38,46,47 ] and pmca reactions [ 48 ] have used the immunoblot - based detection of much larger pk - resistant cores , typically comprised of residues ~ 90 - 231 , as a positive readout .
thus , much more extensive packing of more n - proximal residues is required in the latter reactions , as it is in vivo , giving more opportunities for sequence differences between seed and substrate to influence conversion .
nonetheless , despite the lower sequence specificity of rt - quic reactions , we and others have observed multiple examples of rprpsen substrates that can be converted by some types of prion seeds and not others [ 22,23 ] .
therefore , we were surprised to find that bv rprpsen can be induced to convert to tht - positive amyloid by every type of prion - associated seed that we have tried so far ( n = 28 ) , including several that had never before been detected by rt - quic or pmca .
we also did not anticipate that different pk - resistant bv rprpres products of rt - quic reactions would be seeded with different prion strains from a single host species , because we had never seen such distinct templating with the many other rprpsen substrates that we have tested .
these findings suggest that bv rprpsen - based rt - quic reactions may provide a new means of probing the strain - dependent heterogeneity of prion seeding activities and conformational templates .
however , overall , the rt - quic technology has been established largely for the practical purposes of rapid , sensitive prion disease - associated seed detection rather than the in vitro recapitulation of prion propagation .
as such , the rt - quic tests have not been developed to reflect prion transmission barriers or strain - specificities .
in any case , the availability of bv rprpsen as an apparently universal rt - quic substrate may markedly improve the practicality , efficiency and cost - effectiveness of detecting and discriminating prions .

ay907689 ]) prion protein genes were ligated into the pet41 vector ( emd biosciences ) .
vectors were transformed into rosetta ( de3 ) escherichia coli and were grown in luria broth medium in the presence of kanamycin and chloramphenicol .
protein expression was induced using the autoinduction system [ 50,51 ] and was purified from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions using ni - nitrilotriacetic acid ( nta ) superflow resin ( qiagen ) with an akta fast protein liquid chromatographer ( ge healthcare life sciences ) .
the protein was refolded on the column using a guanidine hcl reduction gradient and eluted using an imidazole gradient as described [ 49 ] .
the eluted protein was extensively dialyzed into 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 5.8 ) , filtered ( 0.22 - mum syringe filter [ fisher ]) and stored at - 80degreesc .
protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. brain homogenate preparations brain homogenates ( bh ; 10 % w / v , tables 1 and 2 ) were prepared as previously described [ 14 ] and stored at - 80degreesc .
for rt - quic analysis bhs were serially diluted in 0.1 % sds ( sodium dodecyl sulfate , sigma )/ n2 ( gibco )/ pbs as previously reported ( 25 ) , or where indicated the last dilutions were performed to a final concentration of 0.05 % sds / n2 / pbs .
rt - quic protocol rt - quic reactions were performed as previously described [ 14 ] .
reaction mix was composed of 10 mm phosphate buffer ( ph 7.4 ) , 300 or 130 mm nacl , 0.1 mg / ml rprpsen , 10 mum thioflavin t ( tht ) , 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt ( edta ) , and 0.002 % or 0.001 % sds .
nacl and sds concentrations were varied where indicated .
aliquots of the reaction mix ( 98 mul ) were loaded into each well of a black 96 - well plate with a clear bottom ( nunc ) and seeded with 2 mul of indicated bh dilutions .
the plate was then sealed with a plate sealer film ( nalgene nunc international ) and incubated at 42degreesc in a bmg fluostar omega plate reader with cycles of 1 min shaking ( 700 rpm double orbital ) and 1 min rest throughout the indicated incubation time .
tht fluorescence measurements ( 450 +/ - 10 nm excitation and 480 +/ - 10 nm emission ; bottom read ) were taken every 45 min .
to compensate for minor differences in baselines between fluorescent plate readers and across multiple experiments , data sets were normalized to a percentage of the maximal fluorescence response ( 260,000 rfu ) of the plate readers after subtraction of the baseline , as described [ 34 ] , and plotted versus reaction time .
reactions were classified as rt - quic positive base on criteria similar to those previously described for rt - quic analyses of brain specimens [ 14,34 ] .
proteinase k ( pk ) digestion of rt - quic products and immunoblotting rt - quic reaction products were collected from the plates by extensive scraping and pipetting and treated with 10 mug / ml proteinase k ( pk ) for 1 hour at 37degreesc with 400 rpm orbital shaking .
equal volumes of pk - treated reactions were run on 12 % bis - tris nupage gels ( invitrogen ) .
proteins were transferred to an immobilon p membrane ( millipore ) using the iblot gel transfer system ( invitrogen ) .
membranes were probed with r20 primary antiserum ( hamster epitope : residues 218 - 231 ) [ 52 ] diluted 1:15,000 and visualized with the attophos ap fluorescent substrate system ( promega ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .

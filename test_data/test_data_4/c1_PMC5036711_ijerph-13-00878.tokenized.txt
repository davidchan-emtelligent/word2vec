this work investigated the spatial profile and source analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in soil that surrounds coal - fired power plants in xuzhou , china .
high - throughput sequencing was employed to investigate the composition and structure of soil bacterial communities .
the total concentration of 15 pahs in the surface soils ranged from 164.87 to 3494.81 mug / kg dry weight .
the spatial profile of pahs was site - specific with a concentration of 1400.09 - 3494.81 mug / kg in yaozhuang .
based on the qualitative and principal component analysis results , coal burning and vehicle emission were found to be the main sources of pahs in the surface soils .
the phylogenetic analysis revealed differences in bacterial community compositions among different sampling sites .
proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum , while acidobacteria was the second most abundant .
the orders of campylobacterales , desulfobacterales and hydrogenophilales had the most significant differences in relative abundance among the sampling sites .
the redundancy analysis revealed that the differences in bacterial communities could be explained by the organic matter content .
they could also be explicated by the acenaphthene concentration with longer arrows .
furthermore , otus of proteobacteria phylum plotted around particular samples were confirmed to have a different composition of proteobacteria phylum among the sample sites .
evaluating the relationship between soil pahs concentration and bacterial community composition may provide useful information for the remediation of pah contaminated sites .
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons spatial distribution source apportionment high - throughput sequencing soil microbial community 1 .
introduction as an important class of persistent organic pollutants ( pops ) , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are mainly originated from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels , forest fires , crop straw and other organic materials that continuously burn [ 1,2 ] .
the derivatives from the diagenesis of crude oil and organic matter under anoxic conditions are also the main pah sources [ 3 ] .
pahs are ubiquitous environmental contaminants which are widely distributed in various environments , such as the atmosphere , water , soils and sediments [ 4,5 ] .
as a rapidly developing country , china has the highest pah emissions in the world .
pas emission in china was around 114 gg in 2004 , constituting 22 % of total global emissions [ 6 ] .
due to the carcinogenic properties and persistence of pahs in the environment , many countries have taken efforts in reducing pah emissions .
understanding the contribution of pah emission sources is important for proper management of pah levels in the environment .
the study of pah distribution in representative locations can assist in understanding the relation between pah characteristics and their anthropogenic influence .
natural ( such as oil seeps and forest fires ) and anthropogenic ( such as fossil fuels and combustion ) inputs can be traced when pahs are used alongside with related hydrocarbon marker compounds [ 7 ] .
the source discrimination of pahs is facilitated by many approaches , such as pah ratio methods [ 8 ] , multivariate analysis [ 9 ] and isotope ratio mass spectrometry [ 10 ] .
diagnostic ratios can be used for qualitative analysis of various pah component sources and can primarily give valuable information primarily when there are one or two main sources .
however , in the vast majority of cases , more details about the source apportionment are essential for controlling pah pollution .
it has been reported that it is difficult for finer differentiation of possible combustion sources due to the overlap .
it has been mainly confined to the laboratory or urban locations [ 11 ] .
principal component analysis ( pca ) provides a recognition capability , which could improve the source discrimination .
pca is a commonly used tool for multi - variable analysis .
however , it is not restricted to the study of receptor model in the research of environmental source apportionment [ 12 ] .
once introduced into the soil , pahs can be decomposed via biotic or abiotic processes , or it can be transferred to soil profiles and groundwater through runoff and leaching [ 3 ] .
as the most abundant and diverse groups of soil microorganisms , bacteria play an indispensable role in soil ecology , particularly due to their central role in decomposition .
due to their enormous metabolic versatility , they also serve as keystones in biogeochemical cycling [ 13 ] .
microbial degradation is a primary process occurring in the natural pah depletion processes .
bacteria that have excellent pah - degrading ability are widespread in various environmental media .
according to several reports , indigenous microbial communities are important for the success of bioremediation .
however , little is known about the difference of microbial composition and structures among the real , historically contaminated soil [ 14 ] .
adequate information of microbial consortia structure is useful for monitoring the occurrence of real time biodegradation processes , as well as for carrying out accurate risk assessment in situ .
studies on bacterial community structure associated with bioremediation of pah - contaminated soils have been reported using traditional standard biochemical tests [ 15 ] .
most soil microorganisms cannot be cultivated at present by laboratory approaches [ 16 ] .
therefore , several molecular biological techniques such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism ( t - rflp ) and polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( pcr - dgge ) have been employed to characterize bacterial community structures [ 17,18 ] .
however , unlike the dgge method , the t - rflp technique could not be used for map hybridization or direct cloning and sequencing analysis .
the single enzyme digestion fragment is not accurate enough to identify the genus level in the database .
in addition , the experimental procedures for dgge are cumbersome and time consuming .
some analyzing fragments are easily lost in the repeated pcr process of dgge .
also , these expensive and time - costly techniques can only provide limited information on community structures .
in recent years , high - throughput sequencing techniques , such as illumina sequencing , have enabled more comprehensive detection of microbial community changes and minor populations [ 19,20 ] .
this approach has been used to decipher microbial communities in distinct samples , such as samples taken from polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated environments [ 21 ] , river water [ 22 ] and iron mining soil [ 23 ] .
xuzhou is the most important coal production base and an important thermal power plant base in east china .
it has more than 80 years of history in producing and using coal .
it is generally believed that coal combustion in coal - fired power plants is the main source of pah pollution in surrounding farmland .
however , with the rapid development of automobiles in china , vast petroleum consumption overlaps with human - intensive activity areas .
therefore , it is crucial to the repair strategy formulation to determine whether or not coal combustion is the only pollution source for coal - fired power plants in the surrounding farmland .
based on these reasons , this work investigated the surrounding soil of coal - fired power plants to confirm the source and to provide a scientific basis for soil remediation .
moreover , illumina sequencing was applied to examine microbial community profiles in different sampling sites .
this study is intended to provide broad insights for assessing the impact of coal - fired power plants on pahs emission and surrounding environments .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
site description and sampling figure 1 demonstrates the locations of sampling sites .
these location sites include the following : there were seven samples ( px1 - px7 ) collected from the datun electric power plant , three samples ( hr1 - hr3 ) near the huarun power plant , three samples ( dt1 - dt3 ) along the datang power plant , three samples ( hm1 - hm3 ) along the huamei plant , three samples ( yz1 - yz3 ) near the yaozhuang power plant and four samples ( qt1 - qt4 ) near the quantai power plant .
soil samples were collected in november 2014 .
the top 10 cm layers were carefully removed with an iron shovel .
all samples were packed into aluminum boxes and immediately stored at 4 degreesc just for 1 - 3 days before being extracted .
after air - drying at room temperature , the soils were sieved through a 100 - mesh sieve .
total organic matter ( tom ) was determined through the walkley - black wet oxidation method [ 24 ] .
2.2 .
chemicals a mixture of 16 usepa priority pahs standards solution [ naphthalene ( nap ) , acenaphthylene ( acy ) , acenaphthene ( ace ) , fluorene ( fle ) , phenanthrene ( phe ) , anthracene ( anth ) , fluoranthene ( fla ) , pyrene ( pyr ) , benzo [ a ] anthracene ( baa ) , chrysene ( chr ) , benzo [ b ] fluoranthene ( bbf ) , benzo [ k ] fluoranthene ( bkf ) , benzo [ a ] pyrene ( bap ) , indeno [ 1,2,3 - c,d ] pyrene ( ind ) , dibenz [ a,h ] anthracene ( dba ) , and benzo [ g,h,i ] perylene ( bgp )] was purchased from tci development co. , ltd .
( beijing , china ) .
all organic solvents are hplc grade and purchased from sk chemicals ( ulsan , korea ) .
in order to exclude impurities before use , analytical - grade anhydrous na2so4 and silica gel were activated at 320 degreesc to exclude impurities before use .
2.3 .
pah analysis one gram of sieved soil was combined with a 4 ml mixture of dichloromethane and acetone ( v : v , 1:1 ) and then sonicated for 30 min .
the process was repeated three times by removing the extract and adding fresh solvent .
all extracts were combined and concentrated by rotary evaporation .
then , eluting through a chromatography column , which was filled with silica gel and anhydrous na2so4 , purified them .
the elution liquid was dried under nitrogen , and the residue was dissolved in 1 ml acetonitrile for hplc analysis [ 2 ] .
the pahs were analyzed by hplc ( shimadzu - uflc - 10a , shimadzu ( china ) co. , shanghai , china ) with a fluorescence detector .
the pah special column ( waters , 250 mm x 4.5 mm , 5 mum ) was packed into the analyzer .
the injection volume was only 1 mul .
also , the column temperature was 35 degreesc .
the gradient operation procedure was conducted as follows : at the beginning , 55 % acetonitrile was used , 10 min later , 70 % acetonitrile was used for a linear gradient at100 % acetonitrile for 15 min .
this was kept for 5 min at 100 % acetonitrile .
a linear gradient ( 2 min ) back to starting conditions was followed by a 3 min run to stop .
in this study , a fluorescence detector quantified 15 pahs , excluding acenaphthylene .
in this study , the phe / anth , fla / pyr , fla /( fla + pyr ) and ind /( ind + bgp ) values were used to determine the pah sources .
2.4 .
microbial community analyses according to the instruction manual of the fastdnatm spin kit , dna was extracted from 0.5 g soils ( mp biomedicals , solon , oh , usa ) in duplicate which have been stored at 4 degreesc .
using an eppendorf thermal cycler ( model 5332 ) , the v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified .
the temperature program consisted of initial denaturing at 98 degreesc for 5 min .
this was followed by 25 cycles at 98 degreesc for 30 s , 50 degreesc for 30 s , 72 degreesc for 30 s. then there was a final extension step at 72 degreesc for 5 min .
the primer set for the amplification was 520f ( 5 ' - barcode + gcacctaaytgggydtaaagng - 3 ') and 802r ( 5 ' - tacnvgggtatctaatcc - 3 ') .
the barcode was a seven - base sequence unique to each sample .
the pcr reaction was conducted in triplicate in a 25 - mul mixture containing 5 mul of 5 x q5 reaction buffer , 5 mul of 5 x q5 gc high enhancer , 2 mul of 2.5 mmdntps , 1 mul of each primer ( 10 mum ) , 0.25 mul of q5 polymerase , 8.75 mul of sterilizing ultrapure water and 2 mul of template dna ( 20 ng / mul ) .
three pcr products per sample were pooled and purified with the axyprep dna gel extraction kit ( axygen biosciences , union city , ca , usa ) in accordance with the instruction manual .
quantification of purified pcr product was performed with a quant - itpico green dsdna assay kit ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
the purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired - end sequenced ( 2 x 300 bp ) on an illuminamiseq platform ( personalbio , shanghai , china ) according to standard protocols .
raw fastq files were de - multiplexed and quality - filtered using qiime ( version 1.7.0 ) with the following criteria : ( 1 ) 300 - bp reads were truncated at any site that acquired an average quality score of > 20 over a 10 - bp sliding window .
truncated reads shorter than 150 bp were discarded ; ( 2 ) reads that contain ambiguous characters and two nucleotides that mismatched in primer matching were removed ; ( 3 ) according to overlapped sequences , overlapping sequences that are longer than 10 bp would be assembled .
unassembled reads were discarded .
operational taxonomic units ( otus ) having 97 % similarity were clustered using the uparse soft ( version 7.1 ) .
the uchime method was used to identify and remove the chimeric sequences [ 23 ] .
greengene was used as the annotation database [ 25 ] .
sequences that could not be allocated into any known groups were defined as others .
2.5 .
data analyses pca was employed to analyze the data groups of pahs concentrations in order to compare the profiles of each potential pah source using spss 18.0 software ( cabit information technology co. , shanghai , china ) .
redundancy analysis ( rda ) with the monte carlo permutation 's test ( 499 permutations ) was used to evaluate the correlation between soil environmental factors and bacterial community structures through the use of the software canoco ( cabit information technology co. , shanghai , china ) for windows 4.5 .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
spatial distribution of pahs in the surface soil the contamination level of pahs in soil can be divided into four classes : no contamination ( total pahs concentration < 200 mug / kg ) , slight contamination ( 200 < total pahs concentration < 600 mug / kg ) , moderate contamination ( 600 < total pahs concentration < 1000 mug / kg ) and severe contamination ( total pahs concentration > 1000 mug / kg ) [ 26 ] .
the condition of surface soils can reflect the current soil contamination status .
as shown in figure 2 , the total concentration of 15 pahs in soils ranged from 164.87 to 3494.81 mug / kg dry weight with an average concentration of 1089.69 mug / kg. according to the grading criteria , the pahs pollution levels in the study area rangedfrom no pollution to severe pollution .
at sites px6 and yz3 , two highest pahs concentration were observed ( 3412.64 and 3494.81 mug / kg ) .
compared with the pah concentrations reported in farmland or suburb soil of korea ( 236 mug / kg ) , switzerland ( 225 mug / kg ) , malaysia ( 155 mug / kg ) , new orleans ( 242 mug / kg ) and shanghai ( 665.8 mug / kg ) [ 27,28,29,30,31 ] , the average concentration of 1089.69 mug / kg found in this study was much higher .
however , compared with the pah concentration of 1840 mug / kg in urban surface soil of tianjin [ 32 ] , the pah concentration in this study was lower .
according to the soil quality standard of canada , the reference value of bap in agricultural land is 100 mug / kg [ 33 ] .
bap has also been classified as group 1 toxic in regard toits carcinogenicity to humans by the iarc ( international agency for research on cancer ) [ 34 ] .
in this work , bap concentrations in five samples ( px4 , px6 , yz1 , yz2 and yz3 ) exceeded the reference value ( figure 2 ) .
tom is an important factor that can impact the transport and fate of pahs in soils [ 11 ] .
the relatively low concentrations of pahs at power plants hr , dt , hm and qt showed consistentlow levels of tom ( figure 2 ) .
a linear regression analysis indicated that the total concentrations of pahs were significantly correlated with the tom contents ( r = 0.894 , p < 0.01 ) .
however , the relatively low concentration of pahs at site px5 with higher tom content suggested that there existed other factors , such as the application of livestock manure , which may affect tom levels .
3.2 .
source analysis via pahs constitution according to ring numbers , 15 pahs were classified into three classes : 2 - 3 ring , 4 - ring , and 5 - 6 ring compositions .
these three classes represented low , medium and high molecular weight pahs , respectively .
figure 3 shows the composite model of 15 pahs .
4 - ring pahs comprised more than 50 % of the total pahs in all sampling sites , in particularly sites dt , hm and yz , which all had two samples with more than 75 % 4 - ring composition .
for the composition of 2 - 3 ring and 5 - 6 ring pahs , significant discrepancies were detected between sampling sites .
sites px and hm had higher 5 - 6 ring pahs composition , while sites hr and qt had higher 2 - 3 ring composition .
these findings indicated that there may be different sources for the pahs in the soils surrounding different sampling sites .
the component percentages of pahs at sites hr and qt were similar , suggesting their similar pollution sources .
relative to low molecular weight pahs ( 2 - 3 rings ) , pahs with higher molecular weights (>= 4 rings ) adsorb more easily on particulate matter , such as soil particles [ 35 ] .
3.3 .
qualitative research of pahs sources the analysis and confirmation of pahs sources are important to regulate and manage their input , as well as their distribution liability for remediation activity .
based on the characteristics of pahs compositions and allocation patterns , the sources of anthropogenic pahs that were formed primarily through emission and combustion of incomplete combusted materials , can be differentiated by individual pah ratios [ 8 ] .
as isomers , anth is thermodynamically more unstable than phe .
the phe / anth value > 10 suggests petrogenic contamination , whereas the value < 10 implies a pyrolytic source [ 11 ] .
pyr is thermodynamically more stable than fla .
fla / pyr > 1 is a feature of the pyrolytic process , while fla / pyr < 1 indicates a petroleum origin [ 7 ] .
as shown in figure 4a , the phe / anth ratios of soil samples ranged from 7.58 to 47.23 .
all the samples had phe / anth ratios higher than 10 , except for sites px , dt and hm. this suggested that soil pahs might be mainly from petrogenic sources .
fla / pyr values in sites px , dt , hm and qt were mostly less than 1 , indicating petrogenic sources of pahs .
this was in agreement with the results of phe / anth ratios ( figure 4a ) .
however , the range of fla / pyr ratios in samples of sites hr and yz was from 0.94 to 1.24 , suggesting a mix of petrogenic and pyrogenic sources .
for fla /( fla + pyr ) , a ratio < 0.40 suggests petrogenic origins , a ratio > 0.50 implies coal , grass , and wood combustion origins , and a ratio of 0.40 - 0.45 has been described for gasoline engine exhausts [ 8 ] .
different ratios of ind /( ind + bgp ) have been connected to diesel and gasoline vehicles [ 36 ] .
a ratio below 0.20 is ascribed to petrogenic origins .
a ratio above 0.50 indicates wood and coal combustion , whereas the ratio between 0.20 and 0.50 is a trait of petroleum burning performance .
as shown in figure 4b , the ratios of fla /( fla + pyr ) in all sampling sites were higher than 0.40 , except for one sample from site dt , with an average value of 0.49 .
this suggested that these sites had the mixed pattern of petroleum and biomass burning sources .
several samples from site px had the ratio of fla /( fla + pyr ) between 0.40 and 0.45 , which implied there was a gasoline fuel combustion source .
also as shown in figure 4b , the ratio of ind /( ind + bgp ) was mostly lower than 0.50 , particularly , the ratio for sites qt and px were lower than 0.20 , indicating petrogenic origins .
the ind /( ind + bgp ) ratio of samples from site hr , dt and hm was mostly between 0.20 and 0.50 , suggesting petroleum burning sources .
according to pahs source patterns revealed by the specific values of phe / anth , fla / pyr , fla /( fla + pyr ) and ind /( ind + bgp ) , pahs in the sampling sites were primarily from the mixed sources of petroleum and petroleum combustion .
3.4 .
source estimates by pca the objective of pca is to perform the diversification of pahs concentrations among sampling sites with the minimum number of factors .
the weighted linear combination of the original variablesis the first factor accounting for the greatest variability .
each subsequent factor is responsible for less variability than the former one .
the results of pca based on pahs concentrations are listed in table 1 .
three principal components ( pcs ) were extracted for soils , which accounted for more than 97 % of the variance in the data set .
the cumulative variances occupied 88.236 % of the total variation .
the three factors were 58.132 % , 22.334 % , and 7.770 % , respectively .
each variation 's load value > 0.7 was highlighted in red bold face .
factor 1 is heavily weighted by fle , phe , anth , fla , pyr , baa , chr , bbf and bap .
previous studies reported the following as dominant , coal combustion profiles : fla , pyr , phe , anth and baa [ 11,37 ] .
thus , factor 1 seemed to be associated with coal burning .
factor 2 is predominately weighted by nap and ind .
nap is the lightest pahs quantified , which could be related to the unburned fossil fuels and other sources [ 38 ] .
ind has been detected from both diesel and gas vehicle exhaust [ 39 ] .
bgp , the third highest loading value of factor 2 , has been confirmed as indicators of automobile emission [ 40 ] .
therefore , factor 2 mainly represents vehicle emissions .
factor 3 shows a good relevance to dba , which has been reported to be related to automotive engine exhaust [ 41 ] .
generally , the pca results were in accordance with the results depicted by diagnostic ratios .
the pahs in most soil samples were from both coal combustion and vehicle exhaust .
also , pca results indicated that pahs distribution in the soil samples could be related to the surrounding coal - fired plants .
3.5 .
bacterial taxonomy composition the bacterial otus obtained from illumina sequencing of 16s rrna genes were classified into 35 different phyla or 254 orders .
figure 5a showed that acidobacteria , actinobacteria , bacteroidetes , chloroflexi , gemmatimonadetes , planctomycetes , proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia phyla accounted for more than 80 % of the total reads in every sample .
phyla that occupied less than 1 % of the bacterial communities were not shown .
proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum ( figure 5a ) , ranging from 15.1 % to 36.6 % in the samples .
acidobacteria , the second most abundant phylum , occupied about 15.6 % in all samples .
in general , bacterial community structures varied among different sampling sites ( figure 5a ) .
the trend was more evident as revealed by rda analysis with samples that came from around the same power plants grouped nearer to each other ( figure 6 ) .
the orders of campylobacterales , desulfobacterales and hydrogenophilales from phylum proteobacteria showed the most obvious distinction of relative abundances among the sampling sites ( figure 5b ) .
relative abundances of the three orders were higher in sites hr and yz than others .
it has been reported that desulfobacterales are sulfate reducing bacteria and strictly anaerobic [ 42 ] .
in contrast , the relative abundances of rhodospirillale sand entotheonellales were similar across all the samples .
bacterial consortia enriched from natural communitieshad been reported with reduced complexity .
this facilitated the relationship between specific populations and functions .
sun et al .
[ 43 ] identified alphaproteobacteria ( rhizobium ) and betaproteobacteria ( hydrogenophaga ) as the most abundant bacterial components of a pyrene - degrading consortium .
jones et al .
[ 44 ] also identified that cupriavidus ( betaproteobacteria ) and luteimonas ( gammaproteobacteria ) had a close correlation with benzo ( a ) pyrene cometabolism in the pahs polluted soil .
getting information about the response of community members to the stimulation can guide the interpretation and development of remediation approaches .
handley et al .
[ 45 ] employed a high - density microarray ( phylochip ) to comprehensively determine community membership and abundance patterns among a suite of samples associated with uranium bioremediation experiments .
results showed that campylobacteriales thrived as a response to acetate amendments and they were associated with fe ( iii ) and sulfate reduction .
zhao et al .
[ 46 ] have detected campylobacteriales in reactors with multiple electron acceptors , under sulfur cycling conditions .
it was also reported that campylobacteriales were detected in wastewater , microbial fuel cells ( mfcs ) and microbial electrolysis cells ( mecs ) studies [ 47 ] .
all these studies imply that campylobacteriales have a significant role in decomposing organic matters .
higher relative abundances of campylobacterales , desulfobacterales and hydrogenophilales in sites hr and yzmight be related to higher pah concentration .
the results also suggested that we might get high efficiency degrading strains from yz sites .
this study confirms the important role of proteobacteria in pahs polluted soils .
in this study , the high - throughput 16s rna gene sequencing provides detailed information on the taxa comprising of bacterial community .
however , it gave little insight into the functional role of the proteobacteria phylum , especially campylobacterales , desulfobacterales and hydrogenophilales .
future research will be of interest in pursuing a deeper understanding of the metabolism and diversity of this phylum .
3.6 .
correlation between bacterial community structure and pah content and tom the redundancy analysis ( rda ) ordination diagram is plotted in figure 6a .
the goodness of fit statistics for environmental variables showed that the ordination was highly correlated with tom , ace , fle and other pahs ( p < 0.05 ) with long arrows ( figure 6a ) .
among the environmental factors , tom , ace , chr and fle were highly correlated with axis 1 , which explained most of the variations in the bacterial community .
this is not surprising because tom was shown to be correlated with pah concentration , as revealed in figure 2 .
the arrows of tom and ace were longer , indicating that they were the most important variables regarding bacterial community ordination .
the tom content was highly correlated with bacterial community structures in site px ( figure 6a ) .
fle , phe and anth distinguished the bacterial community of site hr from other sites ( figure 6a ) .
moreover , bacterial communities of sites hr and yz showed more distinctions compared with other sites with different pahs contents as revealed in figure 6a .
other environmental factors such as ph and ec values have been measured too .
however , no regularity has been found between ph , ec values and variation of bacterial phyla ( data not shown ) .
rda ordination showed several otus of proteobacteria particularly characterized some communities according to the bacterial community composition ( figure 6b ) .
sites px , qt and dt were associated with otus belonging to deltaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria classes : entotheonellaceae ( otu0004 ) , syntrophobacteraceae ( otu0017 ) , piscirickettsiaceae ( otu0005 and otu0007 ) and sinobacteraceae family ( otu0015 ) .
site hm was characterized by otus related to alphaproteobacteria ( otu0001 ) and betaproteobacteria classes ( otu00012 ) .
sites hr and yz were related to deltaproteobacteria ( otu0002 and otu0003 ) , betaproteobacteria ( otu0006 ) and alphaproteobacteria ( otu0016 ) .
the arrows of otu0001 , otu0002 , otu0003 , otu0005 , otu0006 and otu0017 were longer , which indicated that these six otus were the most important variable otus characterizing the sampling sites .
the relationship between otus and samples showed that the abundance order of otu0001 in each site was hm > yz > qt > hr =~ px > dt. the abundance order of otu0002 , otu0003 and otu0006 was hr =~ yz > qt =~ px > hm =~ dt. the abundance order of otu0017 in each site was hm =~ dt > qt =~ px > hr =~ yz. these results indicated that the proteobacteria phylum had significantly different compositions among the sampling sites .
moreover , some researches revealed that betaproteobacteria ( acidovorax , and hydrogenophaga ) might have a crucial role in the early response to pah exposure 16 .
moreover , other authors also revealed groups of phenanthrene , anthracene and pyrene - degrading proteobacteria [ 48,49,50 ] , whose abundance and response to simulated bioremediation was demonstrated by barcoded pyrosequencing [ 14 ] .
4. conclusions this work provides important information on the distribution tendency of pahs and the soil microbial community in soil samples surrounding a few coal - fired power plants .
a positive association was found between pahs and soil organic matter .
the most affluent pah congener of all samples was considered to be the four - ring pahs .
most pahs were primarily from coal burning or vehicle exhaust , which may be related to the surrounding coal - fired plants .
shifts in diversity and composition of bacterial community were also defined .
soil organic matter was correlated with pah concentrations .
the correlation between soil organic matter and pahs concentrations may account for the differences among bacterial communities .
proteobacteria phylum was the most abundant group and had the greatest variation .
the obvious changing trend related to proteobacteria may provide useful information for further research on the relationship between pahs and bacterial communities .
this phylum can be also considered an important biological resource for bioremediation of pah - contaminated soil .

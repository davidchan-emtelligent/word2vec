transcriptional factors ( tfs ) play important roles in the responses to oxidative , acid , and other environmental stresses in gram - positive bacteria , but the regulatory mechanism of tfs involved in oxidative stress remains unknown in lactic acid bacteria .
in the present work , homologous overexpression strains with 43 tfs were constructed in the lactobacillus plantarum cauh2 parent strain .
the strain overexpressing copr displayed the highest sensitivity and a 110 - fold decrease in survival rate under h2o2 challenge .
the importance of copr in the response to h2o2 stress was further confirmed by a 10.8 - fold increase in the survival of a copr insertion mutant .
in silico analysis of the genes flanking copr revealed putative copr - binding " cop box " sequences in the promoter region of the adjacent gene copb encoding a cu2 + - exporting atpase .
electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) analysis demonstrated the specific binding of copr with copb in vitro , suggesting copb is a target gene of copr in l. plantarum .
the role of copb involved in oxidative stress was verified by the significantly decreased survival in the copb mutant .
furthermore , a growth defect in copper - containing medium demonstrated that copb functions as an export atpase for copper ions .
furthermore , emsas revealed that copr functions as a regulator that negatively regulates copb gene and cu2 + serves as inducer of copr to activate the expression of copb in response to h2o2 stress in l. plantarum cauh2 .
our findings indicated that copr plays an important role in enhancing oxidative resistance by regulating copb to modulate copper homeostasis .
lactobacillus plantarum cauh2 h2o2 stress copr cu2 + - exporting atpase copper homeostasis national natural science foundation of china10.13039 / 50110000180921476250 introduction lactobacillus plantarum is an aerotolerant gram - positive bacteria belonging to the facultatively heterofermentative group of lactobacilli ( kleerebezem et al. , 2003 ) .
among lactic acid bacteria ( lab ) , this species has one of the largest genomes and a particularly high proportion of regulatory genes , allowing it to survive in a variety of different environmental niches .
consequently , l. plantarum is widely used as a starter culture in fermented food and feed production , such as dairy , meat , and many vegetables and plants ( leroy and de vuyst , 2004 ) .
moreover , some l. plantarum strains have been declared to have health - promoting effects , such as increasing iron absorption and enhancing immunity , and thus can also function as probiotic active ingredients in fermented foods ( hoppe et al. , 2015 ; hulst et al. , 2015 ) .
however , l. plantarum suffers from unavoidable oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species ( ros ) during manufacturing .
ros , including the superoxide anion () , hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) , the hydroxyl radical ( ho *) , and organic hydroperoxides ( rooh ) , can cause significant damage to various cellular structures such as dna , proteins , and cell membranes ( imlay and linn , 1988 ; storz et al. , 1990 ; farr and kogoma , 1991 ; atack and kelly , 2009 ) .
therefore , l. plantarum has developed a variety of adaptive mechanism to cope with oxidative stress .
bacterial cells respond to oxidative stress by inducing the expression of anti - oxidant enzymes .
these mainly include superoxide dismutase ( sod ) , catalase , peroxidase , and glutathione peroxidase ( harris , 1992 ) .
however , l. plantarum lacks a sod enzyme , and instead this bacterium accumulates a high intracellular concentration ( 20 - 30 mm ) of manganese to scavenge superoxide and converts it to h2o2 during fermentative and aerobic growth ( archibald and fridovich , 1981 ) .
in addition , the mannose phosphotransferase system ( pts ) can enhance oxidative tolerance by transporting glucose to generate more atp in l. plantarum wcfs1 ( stevens et al. , 2010 ) .
moreover , overexpression of the trxb1 gene - encoding thioredoxin reductase in l. plantarum wcfs1 can also enhance h2o2 tolerance by inducing a group of 16 gene transcripts involved in purine biosynthesis , cell wall biosynthesis , energy metabolism , cellular envelope biosynthesis , and amino acid metabolism ( serrano et al. , 2007 ) .
in lab , a few transcriptional factors ( tfs ) have been identified as regulators to modulate gene expression in various physiological processes .
in l. reuteri , the pocr - like tf controls the expression of its neighboring loci that harbors the genes for glycerol utilization and vitamin b12 synthesis ( santos et al. , 2011 ) .
a terr - like tf ( lp _ 1153 ) functions as a repressor of the tarijkl locus involved in teichoic acid synthesis in l. plantarum wcfs1 ( tomita et al. , 2015 ) .
in addition , tf ldb0677 has been identified to involve in acid tolerance , which was predicted to regulate 22 target genes by bacterial one - hybrid method in l. bulgaricus cauh1 ( zhai et al. , 2014 ) .
furthermore , the copper homeostasis system controlled by the copy - type repressor has been extensively studied in enterococcus hirae and lactococcus lactis ( solioz et al. , 2010 ) .
the core element of this system in e. hirae is the cop operon encoding four proteins : the repressor copy , copper chaperone copz , copper import atpases copa , and copper export atpases copb .
transcription of this operon is controlled by copy through binding to the " cop box " in the promoter region .
however , the corresponding core element in l. lactis contained a coprza operon and a monocistronic copb , which were both controlled by copr .
copa was identified as a copper - exporting atpase while function of copb is unclear ( solioz et al. , 2011 ) .
in addition , another copr regulon lcto encoding an nad - independent lactate oxidase plays an antioxidant role by attenuating the formation of reactive oxygen radicals in l. lactis ( barre et al. , 2007 ) .
lactobacillus plantarum cauh2 was isolated from szechuan pickle , a traditionally fermented vegetable product from china .
whole - genome sequencing indicated that cauh2 contained about 8.5 % regulatory genes ( genbank accession no. cpo15126 - cpo15129 ) .
furthermore , 45 isogenous genes of tf with known functions were identified in the cauh2 genome .
however , the roles of these tfs in h2o2 resistance remain unknown .
in the present study , homologous overexpression of 43 tf genes in l. plantarum cauh2 was performed to identify potential involvement in h2o2 - induced oxidative stress .
genetic and physical evidence revealed that the tf copr plays an important role in enhancing oxidative resistance by negatively regulating copb to modulate copper homeostasis .
to our knowledge , this is the first report of a tf involved in protection against oxidative stress in l. plantarum .

dna manipulation techniques general molecular techniques including dna electrophoresis analysis , recovery , and storage were performed using standard protocols ( sambrook et al. , 1989 ) .
miniprep plasmid isolation from both e. coli and l. plantarum was performed using the plasmid mini kit i according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( omega bio - tek inc. , doraville , ga , united states ) .
genomic dna from lactobacilli was prepared using the genomic dna extraction kit ( tiangen , beijing , china ) .
lysis of bacterial cells was carried out by adding lysozyme to tes buffer ( 50 mm tris - hcl , 1 mm edta , 25 % sucrose ; ph 8.0 ) to a final concentration of 30 mg ml - 1 , and mixtures were incubated at 37degreesc for 1 h ( vandeguchte et al. , 1989 ) .
plasmids were introduced into e. coli dh5alpha using standard heat shock transformation , and electroporation was used for plasmid transfer into l. plantarum as described previously ( thompson and collins , 1996 ) .
pcr products were amplified using ex taq polymerase ( takara , dalian , china ) .
dna digestions with restriction endonucleases including ncoi , hindiii , kpni , psti , xbai , and ecori were performed according to the supplier 's instructions ( takara , dalian , china ) .
dna ligation was performed using the t4 dna ligation kit ( thermo fisher scientific , beijing , china ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
all primers and probes used in this study were synthesized by sangon biotech ( beijing , china ) .
dna sequencing was performed by sangon biotech and the results were further analyzed with the dnaman software package .
construction of recombinant l. plantarum strains with putative transcription factor using the collection of manually curated inferences of regulons in prokaryotic genomes database1 , 57 isogenous tf genes with known functions were identified in the genome of l. plantarum wcfs1 .
comparative genomics analysis showed that only 45 of these were present in the genome of l. plantarum cauh2 .
these predicted tf genes were amplified using specific primers ( listed in supplementary table s1 ) and inserted into the corresponding sites of pslpa8148 , resulting in a series of pslpa8148 - derived plasmids ( designated as pslpa - tf01 to pslpa - tf43 ) .
the recombinant plasmids were sequenced and transformed into l. plantarum cauh2 to generate corresponding recombinant strains cauh2 - tf01 to cauh2 - tf43 .
meanwhile , a control strain ( cauh2 - pslpa8148 ) was constructed by introducing the empty pslp8148 vector into l. plantarum cauh2 .
to further investigate whether the tfs were successfully expressed , 5 of the 43 strains were randomly selected and sds - page analysis of cultures was performed .
response to h2o2 stress in order to determine the tolerance to h2o2 stress in the 43 l. plantarum recombinant strains , overnight cultures were inoculated into 10 ml of fresh mrs medium containing chloramphenicol .
when cells reached an od600 of 0.8 , 1 ml of each culture was collected and centrifuged at 6000 x g for 2 min , then resuspended in the same volume of fresh mrs medium supplemented with 5 mm h2o2 .
after incubation for 30 min at 37degreesc , the number of colony - forming units per milliliter ( cfu / ml ) was determined by plating 10 - fold serial dilutions on mrs agar containing chloramphenicol and incubating for 16 h at 37degreesc .
survival rates were calculated by dividing the cfu / ml values after h2o2 challenge by the value obtained immediately after resuspension .
all results were obtained by at least three independent experiments and each biological replicate was performed in replicates .
insertional inactivation of the copr gene to study the role of copr in oxidative stress , a copr mutant of cauh2 was constructed using the suicide plasmid puc19em .
the emr cassette was amplified from the plasmid pgm36e using primers em - f and em - r ( supplementary table s2 ) and inserted into the psti and hindiii sites of puc19 , resulting in the suicide plasmid puc19em .
a 316 bp internal region of the copr gene was chosen as a homologous sequence and amplified using the primer pair coprha - f and coprha - r with flanking xbai and ecori sites , respectively .
the digested pcr product was ligated with the corresponding restriction sites of puc19em , and the recombinant plasmid , designated puc19emcopr , was introduced into l. plantarum by electroporation .
recombinants were selected for growth on mrs medium containing erythromycin .
the inability to replicate plasmid puc19emcopr resulted in its integration into the copr gene region of the cauh2 genome under erythromycin selection pressure .
the resulting mutant was designated cauh2deltacopr .
pcr was performed with forward primer emt - f and reverse primer coprt - r to confirm integration of puc19emcopr at the correct genome locus .
the primer emt - f was designed according to the dna sequence of erythromycin resistance genes ( genbank accession no .
km017875.1 ) and the primer coprt - r was designed according to the dna sequence of copr ( a1f92 _ rs13920 ) .
meanwhile , insertional inactivation of the mela gene was carried out by the same procedure to construct a control strain ( cauh2deltamela ) .
the forward primer melaha - f and the reverse primer melaha - r were used to amplify the mutagenic fragments of mela .
to confirm the integration at the correct locus , pcr was performed using primers emt - f and melat - r. purification of recombinant copr and emsas the interaction between copr and the upstream sequence of copb was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) .
primers ( copr - f and coprhis6 - r ) used for amplifying the copr gene are listed in supplementary table s2 .
a his6 tag was introduced at the c - terminus of copr for nickel affinity purification .
the digested pcr product was inserted into pnz8148 at the corresponding sites to obtain the recombinant plasmid pnzcoprhis6 .
this plasmid was introduced into l. lactis nz9000 , and recombinant coprhis6 was expressed and purified using ni sepharose 6 fast flow media ( ge healthcare , uppsala , sweden ) .
purified coprhis6 protein was analyzed by sds - page , and the final protein concentration was measured using a nanodrop 2000 microspectrophotometer ( nanodrop technologies , wilmington , de , united states ) .
electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the lightshift chemiluminescent emsa kit ( thermo fisher scientific , rockford , il , united states ) .
dna probes used for emsa were obtained by annealing complementary oligos ( emsa copb - f and - r , supplementary table s2 ) , which were biotin - labeled using the biotin 3 ' - end dna labeling kit ( thermo scientific ) .
binding reactions ( 20 mul ) contained 1x binding buffer , 50 ng mul - 1 poly dl - dc , 2.5 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0.05 % ( v / v ) nonidet p - 40 , 5 mm mgcl2 , 20 fmol labeled probe , and 2.5 mug coprhis6 .
in order to verify specific binding between protein and dna , a 200 - fold molar excess of unlabeled probe competitor ( 4 pmol ; supplementary table s2 ) was added to the emsa reaction mixture .
in addition , another emsas were further performed under the different concentrations of cu2 + ( 5 , 10 , 25 , and 50 mum ) .
subsequent steps were carried out following the manufacturer 's instructions in both two assays .
copper tolerance assays starter cultures of cauh2deltacopr , cauh2deltacopb , and cauh2deltamela were grown overnight at 37degreesc in mrs medium and inoculated into 10 ml of fresh mrs culture medium containing 1.5 mm cuso4 at 37degreesc for 6 h. the od600 was determined at 60 - min intervals .
all results were obtained by at least three independent experiments and each biological replicate was performed in replicates .
statistical analysis means and standard deviations were calculated .
the student 's t - test was performed to investigate statistical differences .
differences between samples with p - values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
results homologous overexpression of the predicted tf in l. plantarum cauh2 although 45 tfs were detected in the genome of cauh2 , only 43 tf genes were successfully inserted into the vector pslpa8148 .
recombinant plasmids were sequenced and verified by aligning with the database genome sequence of cauh2 .
the correct plasmids were designated pslpa - tf01 to pslpa - tf43 .
these plasmids were transformed into cauh2 to generate recombination strains , designated cauh2 - tf01 to tf43 .
sds - page analysis of cultures from five randomly selected strains revealed the overproduction of 29 , 34 , 14 , 21 , and 15 kd proteins ( figure 1 ) , which corresponded to the expected sizes of trer1 , gntr1 , glnr , flrr , and copr , respectively .
these results confirmed the successful overexpression of the five tfs in l. plantarum cauh2 .
we therefore extrapolated that the other tf genes would also be successfully overexpressed in the host strain l. plantarum cauh2 .
figure 1 analysis of tf overexpression in five randomly selected recombinant strains by sds - page .

red arrows indicate the proteins overexpressed in each sample .
overexpression of trer , mntr , and copr increased the sensitivity of cauh2 to h2o2 to probe the possible roles of the overexpressed tfs in oxidative stress in cauh2 , survival experiments of all 43 recombination strains were performed exposured to 5 mm h2o2 .
the results showed that the survival rates of strains cauh2 - tf04 , cauh2 - tf13 , and cauh2 - tf36 were 3 - , 10 - , and 110 - fold lower than that of the control strain , which harbored tfs trer1 , mntr , and copr , respectively ( p < 0.05 ; figure 2 ) .
these three tfs were involved in trehalose utilization , manganese homeostasis , and copper homeostasis .
however , survivals of the other 40 recombinant strains were not significantly different from the control strain .
these results indicate that mntr , trer , and copr might play an important role in h2o2 tolerance in cauh2 .
overexpression of copr caused the largest decrease in survival of the 43 tfs , and the mechanism of this gene in oxidative stress was therefore further investigated in this study .
figure 2 sensitivity of partial tf overexpression strains to 5 mm h2o2 .
survival rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of colonies obtained on mrs plates after and before h2o2 challenge .
data are averages from at least three independent experiments , and error bars indicate sd. insertional inactivation of copr enhances resistance to h2o2 the copr mutant was constructed as shown in figure 3 .
when chromosomal dna from the cauh2deltacopr mutant was used as template for pcr , the expected 750 kb product was obtained , and sequencing revealed amplification of the expected fragments of the emr and copr genes , confirming the correct integration of emr into the chromosome of cauh2 by a single crossover homologous recombination event .
to eliminate the growing effects of em selective pressure between copr mutant and wild strain , a mela gene mutant cauh2deltamela was constructed as the control strain .
the mela gene ( a1f92 _ 14365 ) encoding the alpha - galactosidase predominantly hydrolyzes the galactooligosaccharides .
thus , the inactivation of mela has no significant effects on cauh2 cells growth in mrs media with glucose as the sole carbon source , which was also confirmed by the growth experiment ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
challenge assays demonstrated that the copr mutant showed significantly higher h2o2 resistance than the control strain , i.e. , 1.3 - , 10.8 - , and 3.4 - fold increase in survival when exposed to 5 , 7.5 , and 10 mm h2o2 , respectively ( p < 0.05 ; figure 4 ) .
these results further confirmed that copr is involved in h2o2 resistance in l. plantarum cauh2 .

survival rates were calculated as the ratio of the number of colonies obtained on mrs plates after and before h2o2 challenge .
data are averages from three independent experiments , and error bars indicate sd. in silico analysis of the copr gene and its flanking dna sequences amino acid sequence alignments showed that copr of cauh2 shares 46 and 30 % identities with e. hirae copy ( genbank accession no. caa86835.1 ) and l. lactis copr ( genbank accession no. np _ 266988 ) , respectively .
the n - terminus sequences for putative dna binding ( magnani et al. , 2008 ) and the c - terminus cxcx6cxc motif for putative copper binding ( strausak and solioz , 1997 ) were conserved in these three copy - type proteins ( figure 5a ) .
according to genome sequence , the putative copr - related genes in l. plantarum cauh2 show a different organization from either e. hirae or l. lactis .
analysis of the regions flanking copr in cauh2 genome revealed two divergent genes : a1f92 _ rs13925 encoding a hypothetical protein , and copb encoding a copper - translocating p - type atpase .
moreover , homologs of the copa and copz genes were also detected in the cauh2 genome .
these two genes are located 27 kb downstream of copb and form a polycistron .
the promoter regions of copr , copb , a1f92 _ rs13925 , and copz were further searched , the cop box consensus sequence tacanntgta was only detected in the copb promoter region .
these results indicated that transcription of copb is under the control of copr in cauh2 .
figure 5 alignment of copr and copb in l. plantarum cauh2 , e. hirae , and l. lactis il1403 .
alignments were obtained using clustalx 2.1 ( larkin et al. , 2007 ) with default settings and visualized in clc sequence viewer 7.8.1 .
( a ) alignment of copr repressors and ( b ) alignment of copb proteins .
further alignments indicated that copb from l. plantarum shares 54 and 49 % amino acid sequence identity with copb from e. hirae and copb from l. lactis .
the cph motif for putative transmembrane metal binding site and dktgt motif for a phosphorylation domain were conserved in these three copb proteins ( odermatt et al. , 1993 ; figure 5b ) .
in addition , only one conserved histidine - and methionine - rich domain for putative metal binding was observed in n - terminus of copb from cauh2 .
copr binds to cop box of copb promoter since the copb gene was identified as a putative target of copr , protein - dna interactions were analyzed by emsa .
copr with a c - terminal his tag was expressed in l. lactis nz9000 and purified by affinity chromatography .
sds - page revealed a single protein band with a molecular mass of about 15 kda , suggesting the recombinant coprhis6 was successfully expressed and purified ( figure 6a ) .
the emsa results indicated that the purified coprhis6 bound to biotin - labeled copb probes , and retarded their mobility ( figure 6b ) .
assays were further performed using unlabeled probes as specific competitors .
the specific shift was abolished , which indicated specific binding of coprhis6 to the copb probe .
these results indicated that copr specifically binds to the predicted binding sites upstream of copb and thereby regulates copb transcription .

binding reactions consisted of the following : lane 1 , 20 fmol labeled probe alone ; lane 2 , 20 fmol labeled probe , and 2.5 mug coprhis6 ; lane 3 , 20 fmol labeled probe , 4 pmol unlabeled probe , and 2.5 mug coprhis6 .
insertional inactivation of copb increases the sensitivity of cauh2 to h2o2 in order to investigate the role of copb in h2o2 stress , a copb mutant , designated cauh2deltacopb , was constructed by homologous recombination and subjected to challenge assays .
when exposed to 5 , 7.5 , and 10 mm h2o2 , the survival rate of cauh2deltacopb was 2.0 - , 2.0 - , and 4.0 - fold lower than that of the control strain , respectively ( p < 0.05 ; figure 4 ) .
these results demonstrated that copb plays a critical role in resistance to h2o2 - induced oxidative stress in cauh2 .
copb functions as a cu2 + induced copper export atpase in cauh2 given that copper can produce hydroxyl radicals from h2o2 , we speculated that copb may be involved in resistance by exporting cu2 + ions from cells .
to confirm whether copb participates in the protection of cauh2 cells as a copper atpase , cauh2deltacopb cells were grown in mrs media containing 1.5 mm cu2 + for 6 h. the growth was clearly retarded compared to the control strain , and significantly less biomass was achieved ( figure 7 ) .
these results suggest that copb improves oxidative tolerance by exporting copper ions as an atpase in l. plantarum cauh2 .
figure 7 growth of the cauh2deltacopb mutant in mrs containing 1.5 mm cuso4 .
all experiments included three biologically independent replicates .
the results are means of biological triplicate samples .
since sequence alignment of copr revealed a potential copper binding site , it was speculated that cu binding may affect its ability to bind cop boxes .
emsa analysis showed that the binding intensity of copr with the probes became weak with an increasing concentration of copper , suggesting that the copr can be released from the cop box in the promoter of copb by cu2 + ( figure 8 ) .
these results revealed that copr functions as a regulator that negatively regulates copb gene and cu2 + serves as inducer of copr to activate the atpase copb to export cupric ions under h2o2 stress in l. plantarum cauh2 .
figure 8 emsas showing the interaction of copr and the predicted binding sites upstream of copb in the presence of different concentrations of cu2 + .
binding reactions consisted of the following : lane 1 , 20 fmol labeled probe alone ; lane 2 , 20 fmol labeled probe and 2.5 mug coprhis6 ; lane 3 , 20 fmol labeled probe and 2.5 mug coprhis6 and 5 mum cu2 + ; lane 4 , 20 fmol labeled probe , 2.5 mug coprhis6 , and 10 mum cu2 + ; lane 5 , 20 fmol labeled probe , 2.5 mug coprhis6 , and 20 mum cu2 + ; and lane 6 , 20 fmol labeled probe , 2.5 mug coprhis6 , and 50 mum cu2 + .
discussion the two oxidation states of copper , cu + and cu2 + , allow its participation in essential redox reactions , but can also promote the formation of ros that causes cellular damage ( karlin , 1993 ) .
thus , copper homeostasis has to be tightly regulated to preclude toxic effects in cells ( vulpe and packman , 1995 ; linder and hazegh - azam , 1996 ) .
previous studies demonstrated that cu + deficiency can lead to a decrease in enzyme activity for heme - dependent catalase and glutathione peroxidase in various tissues ( chen et al. , 1994 ; strain , 1994 ) .
based on the results of our transcriptome analysis on the h2o2 stress response of l. plantarum cauh2 ( ncbi geo series accession no .
gse99096 ) , the genes encoding heme - dependent catalase ( a1f92 _ rs14705 ) and glutathione peroxidase ( a1f92 _ rs00895 ) were up - regulated 2.27 - and 6.23 - fold , respectively , suggesting cauh2 employs these two enzymes as primary intracellular h2o2 scavengers ( abriouel et al. , 2004 ) .
to maintain the activity of these enzymes in the presence of h2o2 , cauh2 cells must increase copper uptake .
in e. hirae , the extracellular reductase cora supplies cu + for uptake by copa ( solioz and stoyanov , 2003 ) .
correspondingly , the ndh2 gene encoding a membrane - anchored type - 2 nadh dehydrogenase ( a1f92 _ rs04560 ) that reduces cu2 + to cu + was also detected in the cauh2 genome ( rodriguez - montelongo et al. , 2006 ) .
transcriptome analysis showed that the ndh2 gene and the copa gene were up - regulated 4 - and 14 - fold under h2o2 stress , respectively , which indicates an increased requirement for copper ions in cauh2 to maintain the activity of catalase and glutathione peroxidase under h2o2 stress .
intracellular copper ions are generally bound to proteins as a cofactor , but they can be released to catalyze the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals .
in cauh2 , a copper chaperone protein ( a1f92 _ rs14195 ) maybe involved in intracellular copper homeostasis as a cu storage protein ( coyle et al. , 2002 ; tapia et al. , 2004 ) .
a previous study found that the total cu binding capacity of this chaperone protein was decreased when it was oxidized ( fabisiak et al. , 1999 ) .
under oxidative stress conditions , free copper ions likely accumulate in cauh2 and damage cellular components through the formation of deleterious hydroxyl radicals .
up - regulation of copb could enhance oxidative resistance by lowering the intracellular concentration of copper ions and preventing the damaging fenton reaction .
in order to clarify the mechanism of copr involved in h2o2 stress response of l. plantarum , the regulation network of copr was summarized in figure 9 .
under the h2o2 stress , cauh2 cells enhance the uptaking of cuprous ions by the up - regulated expression of genes ndh2 and copa to maintain the activity of heme - dependent catalase and glutathione peroxidase , which detoxify the cells by transforming h2o2 into h2o and o2 .
meanwhile , both the free cuprous ions and the cuprous ions binding to copper chaperones are oxidized into cupric ions by the intracellular h2o2 .
as an inducer , the accumulated cu2 + binds to copr to release it from the cop box in copb promoter .
then the accumulated copb enhances the exporting of cu2 + for avoiding damage caused by copper ions .
taken altogether , our results revealed the role of copper atpase copb and its regulator copr in h2o2 tolerance , which is of great importance for exploring novel h2o2 - detoxifying mechanisms in l. plantarum and other bacteria .

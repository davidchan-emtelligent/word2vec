background mucin 1 ( muc1 ) contributes to the growth and metastasis of various cancers , including lung cancer , and muc1 gene length polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to lung cancer and its prognosis .
in contrast , the association between rs4072037 , a single nucleotide polymorphism in muc1 , and lung cancer has not been well studied .
methods in the present study , we determined the rs4072037 genotype and measured serum kl - 6 levels to evaluate the association between lung adenocarcinoma ( adc ) and rs4072037 or serum kl - 6 levels .
dna samples were available for 172 patients and these were included in the genomic analyses .
in addition , 304 patients were included in the serum analyses .
furthermore , 276 healthy volunteers were included in both genomic and serum analyses .
results the rs4072037 genotype was not associated with susceptibility to lung adc or its prognosis .
interestingly , serum kl - 6 levels significantly differed according to rs4072037 genotype in those with t1 or t2 ( p < 0.001 ) , n0 or n1 ( p = 0.002 ) and m0 ( p < 0.001 ) , but not in those with t3 or t4 ( p = 0.882 ) , n2 or n3 ( p = 0.616 ) and m1a or m1b ( p = 0.501 ) .
serum kl - 6 levels were significantly associated with the presence of lung adc , as well as with its progression and prognosis , indicating the crucial involvement of kl - 6 / muc1 in the development of lung cancer and its progression .
conclusion based on these findings , we conclude that rs4072037 does not have a significant impact on the pathogenesis or prognosis of lung adc , whereas serum kl - 6 levels , which might reflecting the molecular length of muc1 , are significantly associated with lung adc .

adenocarcinoma ( adc ) is the most common histological type of lung cancer in the united states , europe , and east asia , including japan [ 1 ] .
although novel therapeutic targets and molecular - targeted agents have been identified and applied in clinical settings , lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the majority of developed countries [ 2 ] .
thus , the identification of novel diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic target molecules is urgently needed .
several types of mucins , including mucin 1 ( muc1 ) , are known to contribute to the growth and metastatic properties of various tumors .
in addition to their anti - adhesion functions , mucins can affect the transcriptional profile of various gene products involved in cancer cell invasion and metastasis by mediating signal - transduction [ 3 , 4 ] .
these findings indicate the potential utility of muc1 as a diagnostic biomarker and / or therapeutic target in lung cancer .
we have previously demonstrated that muc1 variable numbers of tandem repeats ( vntr ) polymorphism was significantly associated with susceptibility to lung adc and its prognosis [ 5 ] .
however , it would be very difficult to identify muc1 gene length polymorphisms in clinical practice .
thus , in the current study , we focused on alternative potential biomarkers which can reflect the vntr polymorphism and are more easily detectable in the clinical setting : rs4072037 , a single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) in the muc1 gene , and serum kl - 6 levels .
rs4072037 , a functional snp in exon 2 of the muc1 gene , regulates splicing site selection during the post - transcriptional regulation process [ 6 ] .
it has also been reported that rs4072037 is in linkage disequilibrium with vntr in muc1 [ 7 ] .
furthermore , several studies have reported an association between rs4072037 and susceptibility to gastric cancer [ 8 - 10 ] .
although no significant association has been demonstrated between rs4072037 and lung cancer , these previous studies suggest that rs4072037 may play a role in the development of lung adc and its progression , and that rs4072037 may have utility as a diagnostic and / or prognostic biomarker in lung adc .
we previously developed a murine igg1 monoclonal antibody ( mab ) , designated kl - 6 , by immunizing a mouse with lung adc vmrc - lcr cells [ 11 ] .
the anti - kl - 6 mab recognizes sialylated carbohydrates attached to the core protein of muc1 through the glycosylation process [ 12 ] .
kl - 6 has been well investigated as a useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for various interstitial lung diseases [ 11 , 13 , 14 ] .
additionally , we have demonstrated that kl - 6 may be a prognostic biomarker for non - small cell lung cancer patients who have been treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors or surgical resection [ 15 , 16 ] .
while these findings were promising , the number of patients evaluated in these two studies was relatively small .
furthermore , the combined contribution of serum kl - 6 with the other important prognostic predictors of lung adc , such as egfr gene mutation status [ 17 ] , was not sufficiently evaluated in the previous studies .
the two aims of the present study were as follows : 1 ) to assess whether rs407247 , a snp in the muc1 gene , is associated with lung adc development or prognosis , and 2 ) to assess whether kl - 6 , a carbohydrate associated with muc1 , improves the predictive power of the other predictive factors in patients with lung adc .
in this study , we evaluated the different rs4072037 genotypes and the serum levels of kl - 6 in 354 patients with lung adc and 276 healthy volunteers ( hvs ) .
methods patients and clinical samples five hundred and fifty - two patients with previously untreated lung adc which was pathologically diagnosed and subsequently treated at hiroshima university hospital ( hiroshima , japan ) between april 2003 and june 2012 were included in this study ( fig. 1 ) .
the inclusion criteria , shown in fig. 1 , were almost identical to those described in our previous studies [ 15 , 16 , 18 - 21 ] .
disease staging in all 552 cases included computed tomography scans of the chest and abdomen , bone scintigraphy or f - 18 fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography , and magnetic resonance imaging of the head .
the clinical or pathologic tnm stage was determined according to the 7th edition of the tnm classification of malignant tumors [ 22 ] .
two hundred and seventy - six hvs who attended health check - ups were also enrolled .
the hvs had no history or current diagnosis of malignancy or apparent lung disease .
serum and peripheral venous whole blood samples were obtained from patients and hvs at enrollment with their written informed consents for using their samples and publishing the data .
serum samples were available for 354 of the 552 patients with adc and for all 276 hvs .
among the 354 patients with adc , egfr gene mutation status was known for 304 patients that were included in the serum analyses .
in addition , dna samples were available for 172 patients and these were also included in the genomic analyses ( table 1 ) .
this study was approved by the ethics committee of hiroshima university hospital ( irb m33 and 326 ) and conducted in accordance with the ethical standards established by the helsinki declaration of 1975. fig. 1 flow diagram of patient selection .

to evaluate egfr mutations , the peptide nucleic acid - locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp test that detects the g719c , g719s , g719a , l858r , l861q , and t790 m mutations and seven different exon 19 deletions was used , as previously described [ 23 ] .
dna preparation and rs4072037 genotyping dna was extracted from peripheral venous whole blood samples using the phenol - chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation methods , as previously described [ 24 - 26 ] .
the rs4072037 genotype was determined by real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) using a commercially available snp genotyping assay ( taqman snp genotyping assay c 27532642 - 10 ; life technologies corp .
carlsbad , ca , usa ) and the applied biosystems 7500 fast rt - pcr system ( life technologies corp. ) measurement of serum kl - 6 levels serum kl - 6 levels were measured with a sandwich - type electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on a picolumi 8220 analyzer ( sanko junyaku , tokyo , japan ) , as previously described [ 15 , 16 , 20 , 27 ] .
statistical analysis the numerical data were presented as the mean +/ - standard error of the mean .
the mann - whitney u - test was used to analyze data between 2 groups ; for 3 or more groups , the kruskal - wallis test followed by multiple comparisons using rank sums was performed [ 28 ] .
when dividing patients into clinical subgroups according to performance status ( ps ) or tnm factors , we performed receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analysis and determined the appropriate cut - off point to predict the prognosis of the patients .
survival analysis was performed using the log - rank test and cox proportional hazards models .
concordance ( c ) - statistics were used to evaluate and compare the cox models .
to test for deviations from hardy - weinberg equilibrium , genotype frequencies were determined by direct counting and the chi - square test or fisher 's exact test were used as appropriate .
allelic frequencies were calculated based on the genotype frequencies , and the association between the minor g allele of rs4072037 and lung adc was tested using the chi - square test or fisher 's exact test .
all statistical analyses were performed using spss for windows , version 18.0 ( spss inc. chicago , usa ) .
results the rs4072037 genotype was not associated with susceptibility to lung adc or its prognosis to investigate the association between rs4072037 and susceptibility to lung adc and / or its prognosis , we extracted dna from peripheral venous blood samples and evaluated the presence of the rs4072037 genotype in 172 adc patients and 276 hvs .
the clinical characteristics of the studied subjects are shown in table 1 .
the hvs were predominantly male and relatively young , compared with patients with lung adc .
the characteristics of patients with adc included in the genomic analyses and those included in the serum analyses were similar .
as shown in table 2 , the genotype distributions of rs4072037 were in hardy - weinberg equilibrium for both patients and hvs ( p = 0.891 and p = 0.979 , respectively ) .
unexpectedly , the genotype distributions of rs4072037 did not differ significantly between patients with adc and hvs ( p = 0.933 ) .
this result was consistent even when we limited the patients to those with advanced stage disease ( table 2 ) .
in addition , genotypes of rs4072037 showed no significant association with the risk of lung adc both in dominant and recessive models ( table 3 ) .
according to the kaplan - meier analysis , the mean survival times for patients with aa , ag , and gg genotypes were 2416.8 +/ - 257.2 days , 1988.8 +/ - 232.5 days and 486.0 +/ - 206.8 days , respectively .
patients with the gg genotype tended to have a poorer prognosis than the other patients , although this was not statistically significant according to the log - rank test ( p = 0.173 ) .
we also have to pay attention to the fact that there was only 4 patients with the gg genotype .

as shown in fig. 2a , there was a significant correlation between the rs4072037 genotype and serum kl - 6 levels in hvs , which was in line with the results of previous studies [ 24 , 29 ] .
in patients with lung adc , a significant correlation between the rs4072037 genotype and serum kl - 6 levels was observed in those with t1 or t2 ( fig. 2b , p < 0.001 ) , n0 or n1 ( fig. 2c , p = 0.002 ) and m0 ( fig. 2d , p < 0.001 ) , but not in those with t3 or t4 ( fig. 2b , p = 0.882 ) , n2 or n3 ( fig. 2c , p = 0.616 ) and m1a or m1b ( fig. 2d , p = 0.501 ). fig. 2 serum kl - 6 according to the genotypes of rs4072037 .

*** p < 0.001 ( mann - whitney u test ) serum kl - 6 levels were significantly elevated in patients with lung adc to confirm the correlation between serum kl - 6 levels and the presence of lung adc , we compared serum kl - 6 levels between 304 patients with adc and 276 hvs .
as shown in fig. 3a , serum kl - 6 levels were significantly higher in patients with adc than in hvs ( 880.8 +/ - 166.3 u / ml and 241.0 +/ - 5.2 u / ml , p < 0.001 ) .
in addition , high serum kl - 6 levels were associated with poor ps ( p < 0.001 , fig. 3b ) , and advanced t , n and m factors ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , respectively ; fig. 3b ) .
on the other hand , serum kl - 6 levels did not differ between patients with adc with wild - type egfr and mutant egfr status ( 768.4 +/ - 170.4 u / ml and 1048.5 +/ - 327.7 u / ml , p = 0.920 , additional file 1 ). fig. 3 serum kl - 6 according to the presence or the clinical stage of lung adenocarcinoma .

*** p < 0.001 ( mann - whitney u test ) serum kl - 6 levels significantly correlated with survival in patients with lung adc we performed roc analysis to evaluate the predictive ability of serum kl - 6 in patients with adc .
the area under the curve for 1 - year , 3 - year , and 5 - year survival was 0.698 ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] = 0.618 - 0.778 ; p < 0.001 , fig. 4a ) , 0.686 ( 95 % ci = 0.622 - 0.749 ; p < 0.001 , fig. 4b ) and 0.656 ( 95 % ci = 0.593 - 0.719 ; p < 0.001 , fig. 4c ) , respectively .
the optimal cut - off value for serum kl - 6 levels to discriminate between survivors and non - survivors was set at 600 u / ml , in accordance with the roc analyses .
according to the kaplan - meier analysis , the mean survival times for patients with higher and lower serum kl - 6 levels were 777.8 +/ - 117.7 days and 2807.6 +/ - 224.2 days , respectively .
patients with higher serum kl - 6 levels had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with lower serum kl - 6 levels , as tested by the log - rank test ( p < 0.001 , fig. 4d ) .
this result was confirmed when we perform additional log - rank test stratified by median value of serum kl - 6 ( p < 0.001 , fig. 4e ) .
to further investigate the predictive ability of serum kl - 6 , we performed cox proportional hazards regression analysis with stepwise selection including both patients with mutant egfr and those with wild type egfr .
the initial covariates included age , gender , smoking history , ps , egfr mutation status , tnm classifications and serum kl - 6 levels .
as shown in table 4a , there was a significant association between serum kl - 6 levels and prognosis in patients with adc , independent of the other covariates ( ps , egfr mutation status , and n and m factors ) .
in addition , this result was not changed when we forcibly include age or gender into the covariates ( data not shown ) .
furthermore , comparison of the c - statistics of each prediction model , with or without serum kl - 6 , demonstrated a significant increase in c - index with the addition of serum kl - 6 to the other covariates ( table 4b ). fig. 4 serum kl - 6 can predict the outcome of patients with lung adenocarcinoma .

ps performance status discussion in the present study , no significant association was found between the rs4072037 genotype and susceptibility to lung adc or its prognosis .
rs4072037 genotype significantly affected serum kl - 6 levels in patients with early stage adc , but not in those with advanced disease .
furthermore , we demonstrated that serum kl - 6 levels were significantly associated with the presence of lung adc and its prognosis .
although the muc1 vntr polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to lung adc and its prognosis [ 5 ] , we found that rs4072037 , a snp in the muc1 gene , was not associated with susceptibility to lung adc or with its prognosis .
muc1 is known to inhibit e - cadherin - mediated cell - cell adhesion and integrin - mediated cell - extracellular matrix adhesion [ 30 , 31 ] .
it is also known that muc1 is involved in the growth and metastasis of various tumors , mainly due to its anti - adhesion and signal - transduction functions [ 3 , 4 ] .
we have previously reported that lung adc cells expressed high levels of kl - 6 / muc1 [ 16 , 32 ] and that an anti - kl - 6 mab induced capping of muc1 , thereby interfering with its anti - adhesion function and inhibiting tumor proliferation [ 33 ] .
on the basis of these previous findings , we hypothesized that the rs4072037 genotype in muc1 was associated with susceptibility to lung adc and / or its prognosis .
however , we failed to verify our hypothesis .
the link between rs4072037 and the vntr polymorphism , which was reported in 1996 [ 7 ] , has actually been challenged by several recent studies .
imbert et al. reported that the muc1 vntr polymorphism correlated with the rs4072037 genotype in only 80 % of dry eye cases [ 34 ] .
a similar result in patients with sarcoidosis was also reported by shigemura et al .
[ 35 ] .
based on these findings , we speculate that the vntr polymorphism in muc1 , but not the rs4072037 genotype , has a significant impact on the pathogenesis and progression of lung adc .
interestingly , we found that the correlation between the rs4072037 genotype and serum kl - 6 levels , which was previously reported [ 24 , 29 , 35 ] , was significant in hvs and in patients with early stage adc , but not in those with advanced adc ( fig. 2 ) .
serum kl - 6 in patients with lung adc , especially in those with advanced disease , is considered to be predominantly derived from lung cancer cells with a minor contribution from normal type ii pneumocytes , which are known to be major source of serum kl - 6 under normal conditions [ 16 , 32 ] .
in addition , serum kl - 6 levels have been reported to be influenced by the molecular size of muc1 in healthy controls or in patients with sarcoidosis [ 35 ] .
however , such a correlation has not been reported in patients with lung cancer .
therefore , we can speculate that the rs4072037 genotype has a significant impact on serum kl - 6 derived from normal type ii pneumocytes , but not on serum kl - 6 derived from lung adc cells .
in cancer cells , alterations in the glycosylation properties of mucins , which encompass aberrant glycosylation of o - linked glycans , are known to play an important role in tumorigenesis , tumor progression , and metastasis [ 36 - 41 ] .
serum kl - 6 levels in patients with lung adc may be influenced by the aberrant glycosylation of o - linked glycans in muc1 and also by the depolarized expression pattern of muc1 in lung adc [ 12 , 16 ] .
the influence of these epigenetic factors may diminish the association between the rs4072037 genotype and serum kl - 6 levels in patients with advanced adc .
in the present study , we successfully confirmed that serum kl - 6 levels are independently associated with prognosis in patients with lung adc .
although the correlation between serum kl - 6 levels and disease progression or prognosis in patients with lung adc has already been reported [ 11 , 15 , 16 ] , the results from the present study are still of pivotal importance ; we have demonstrated that serum kl - 6 is a significant prognostic factor for lung adc , independent of the other known prognostic factors , including egfr mutation status [ 17 ] .
based on these data , it is clear that kl - 6 / muc1 plays an important role in tumor cell growth , proliferation , and metastasis .
therefore serum kl - 6 may be an alternative and useful biomarker ; it can reflect the vntr polymorphism in muc1 and is more easily detectable in the clinical setting .
this study had some limitations .
first , the patient sample size was small , especially for the genomic analysis .
considering the low frequency of the rs4072037 g allele , we cannot exclude the possibility that the small number of patients harboring the g allele influenced the results .
second , age and sex distributions differed between patients and hvs .
despite these limitations , the results from our study are quite evocative and provide important insight into the crucial involvement of kl - 6 / muc1 in the development of lung cancer and its progression .
conclusions in conclusion , we demonstrated that rs4072037 , a snp in muc1 gene , does not affect lung adc development or its prognosis .
we also demonstrated that serum kl - 6 levels were significantly associated with the presence of lung adc and its progression and prognosis , indicating the crucial role of kl - 6 / muc1 in the development of lung cancer and its progression .

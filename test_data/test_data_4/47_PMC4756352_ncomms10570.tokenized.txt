however , the diversity of the nkt cell repertoire and the ensuing interactions with cd1d - antigen remain unclear .
we describe an atypical population of cd1d - alpha - galactosylceramide ( alpha - galcer ) - reactive human nkt cells that differ markedly from the prototypical trav10 - traj18 - trbv25 - 1 + type i nkt cell repertoire .
these cells express a range of tcr alpha - and beta - chains that show differential recognition of glycolipid antigens .
two atypical nkt tcrs ( trav21 - traj8 - trbv7 - 8 and trav12 - 3 - traj27 - trbv6 - 5 ) bind orthogonally over the a ' - pocket of cd1d , adopting distinct docking modes that contrast with the docking mode of all type i nkt tcr - cd1d - antigen complexes .
moreover , the interactions with alpha - galcer differ between the type i and these atypical nkt tcrs .
accordingly , diverse nkt tcr repertoire usage manifests in varied docking strategies and specificities towards cd1d - alpha - galcer and related antigens , thus providing far greater scope for diverse glycolipid antigen recognition .
the invariant alphabetatcr of type i nkt cells recognizes a lipid alpha - galcer presented by cd1d .
here the authors describe atypical alpha - galcer - reactive nkt cells with diverse tcrs , which bind to cd1d - alpha - galcer in a manner distinct from type i nkt cells , thus unveiling greater diversity in lipid antigen recognition .
alphabeta t cells can be activated by peptides , metabolites and lipids when bound to their requisite antigen ( ag ) - presenting molecules123 .
the cd1 family of mhc - class i - like molecules present an array of endogenous and foreign lipids ags that are recognized by specialized t - cell populations45 .
for example , nkt cells are activated by lipid - based ags presented by cd1d6 .
based on ligand specificity and alphabeta tcr composition , nkt cells are broadly sub - divided into two populations , type i and ii. alpha - galactosylceramide ( alpha - galcer ) is the prototypical ag for type i nkt cells , which express an invariant tcr alpha - chain ( trav10 + traj18 + ( valpha24 - jalpha18 ) in humans and the orthologous trav11 + traj18 + ( valpha14 - jalpha18 ) in mice ) 678 .
while type ii nkt cells display a diverse tcr repertoire , and while their ag - specificity remains unclear , they are nevertheless characterized as being non - reactive towards alpha - galcer69 .
the apparent functional divergence between type i and type ii nkt cells arises , in part , from the interaction between the nkt tcr and cd1d - ag8 .
despite the prototypical type i nkt tcr gene usage , variations within the cd1d - alpha - galcer reactive repertoire exist that subsequently impact on ligand specificity and functional outcome .
for example , while human type i nkt cells typically use trbv25 - 1 ( vbeta11 ) - encoded tcr beta - chains , mouse type i nkt cells can utilize trbv13 ( vbeta8 ) , trbv29 ( vbeta7 ) and trbv1 ( vbeta2 ) tcr beta - chains , with the variations in the trbv repertoire impacting on the range of ligands a given nkt tcr can interact with10111213141516 .
similarly , both mouse and human nkt cells can utilize alternative tcr alpha - chains that retains alpha - galcer reactivity1718192021 .
for example , trav10 - traj18 + trbv25 - 1 + nkt cells comprise up to 15 % of human cd1d - alpha - galcer reactive nkt cells17 .
despite their comparable reactivity to alpha - galcer and their identical traj18 usage , these cells appear to exhibit a lower affinity towards alpha - glucosylceramide ( alpha - glccer ) compared with the trav10 + traj18 + type i nkt cells17 .
in contrast , mouse trav13 - 3 + traj50 + trbv13 + ( valpha10 + jalpha50 + vbeta8 +) cd1d - alpha - galcer reactive nkt cells exhibited a greater reactivity towards alpha - glccer in comparison to alpha - galcer , and they were selectively reactive to a mycobacterial ag alpha - glucuronosyldiacylglycerol19 .
moreover , a population of alpha - galcer - reactive trdv1 + ( vdelta1 +) gammadelta t cells was identified recently , and these cells also exhibited a distinct lipid - ag - binding profile , thereby highlighting the breadth of tcr usage that engenders cd1d - alpha - galcer recognition22 .
therefore , if we are to fully understand the significance and therapeutic potential of cd1d - lipid ag recognition in the immune system , it is vital to understand how variations within the nkt tcr repertoire impacts on cd1d - ag recognition .
the crystal structures of a large panel of human and mouse type i nkt tcrs have been determined in complex with cd1d presenting a broad repertoire of chemically distinct lipids including synthetic ligands , self - and microbial ligands101112151920232425262728293031323334 .
universally , despite the nkt cell repertoire and antigenic variations , the resultant type i nkt alphabetatcr - cd1d - ag complexes exhibit a highly conserved docking strategy .
namely , the type i nkt tcr docks , in a parallel manner , over the f ' - pocket of cd1d8 .
here the semi - invariant type i nkt tcr alpha - chain dominated the interaction , binding to cd1d and ag , whereas the tcr beta - chain ligated only to cd1d .
nevertheless , within this consensus footprint , altered contributions from the complementarity determining regions ( cdrs ) of the nkt tcr led to differing patterns of cd1d - ag reactivity .
for example , the cdr3beta loop modulated the extent of cd1d autoreactivity and , hence , the functional response to lipid ags , despite not contacting the ag directly2535 .
moreover , the heightened reactivity of the trav13 - 3 + traj50 + nkt cells towards alpha - glccer was attributable to favourable interactions of the alpha - glccer moiety with the tcr alpha - chain19 .
while some type ii nkt tcrs can dock differently on cd1d , these do not react with alpha - galcer and utilize entirely different tcr v genes3637 .
thus , the question of whether cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive nkt alphabetatcrs can adopt alternative binding modes that may provide greater diversity in ag recognition remains to be determined , and this represents an important issue in understanding the scope of lipid ag recognition by nkt cells .
here we describe a diverse population of cd1d - alpha - galcer reactive cells that we termed ' atypical nkt cells' because they lack the invariant trav10 + traj18 + alpha - chain and the trbv25 - 1 beta - chain that are inherent to type i nkt cells .
these atypical nkt cells exhibited differing specificities towards lipid ags compared with that of type i nkt tcrs .
importantly , these atypical nkt cells could respond to glycolipid ag presented by cd1d with diverse cytokine production , similar to type i nkt cells .
crystal structures of two of these atypical nkt tcrs in complex with cd1d - alpha - galcer showed that , in contrast to type i nkt cell tcrs that dock over the f ' - pocket of cd1d - alpha - galcer , these atypical tcrs docked orthogonally over the a ' - pocket of cd1d - alpha - galcer .
furthermore , the interactions with the lipid ag were completely distinct from those observed with type i nkt tcrs engaging alpha - galcer - cd1d complexes .
thus , variations in the cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive nkt tcr repertoire can manifest in alternative docking strategies on cd1d and diverse reactivity towards cd1d - restricted lipids .
results a diverse human type i nkt cell repertoire a defining characteristic of type i nkt cells is their reactivity towards the prototypical type i nkt cell ag , alpha - galcer , presented by cd1d6 .
the human type i nkt cell repertoire is comprised of the invariant trav10 + traj18 + trbv25 - 1 + nkt cells .
given that a range of tcr beta - chains can support cd1d - alpha - galcer recognition in mice8 , we were interested in exploring whether a similar population of trbv25 - 1 - nkt cells existed in humans .
to establish this , we isolated and expanded cd1d - alpha - galcer reactive nkt cells from healthy human blood donors and performed analytical flow cytometry to identify non - canonical nkt cell tcr subsets , by staining with antibodies specific for trav10 and trbv25 - 1 , along with gammadeltatcr and trdv1 to exclude cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive gammadelta t - cells from the analysis22 .
using this approach , we detected a clear population of trbv25 - 1 - nkt cells , that , in most donors , did not react with ' endogenous' cd1d tetramers , thus implying these cells recognized alpha - galcer presented by cd1d ( fig. 1a ) .
consistent with earlier studies1738 , a population of trav10 - nkt cells was also detected , although interestingly , the proportion of the trbv25 - 1 - and the trav10 - populations within each sample did not always coincide , suggesting that these two subsets were at least partially mutually exclusive .
co - staining with cd4 and cd8alpha co - receptors revealed a variable pattern of expression on the cd1d - alpha - galcer - restricted trbv25 - 1 - cells compared with type i nkt cells ( fig. 1a,b ) .
a more extensive phenotypic analysis of four donors with a detectable population of these cells indicated that while both trbv25 - 1 + ( type i ) and trbv25 - 1 - cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive cells expressed nkg2d ( three out of four donors each ) , there was very little or no expression of a panel of killer inhibitory receptors ( including cd158a / b / f / g / h ) or cd56 ( supplementary fig. 1 ) .
furthermore , cd161 was clearly expressed on the trbv25 - 1 - cells in two out of four donors , versus three out of four donors for type i nkt cells .
thus , while there appears to be significant heterogeneity in the phenotypic profiles of trbv25 - 1 - cells between donors , at least in some cases they resemble type i nkt cells .
analysis of additional donors confirmed that the gammadeltatcr - trbv25 - 1 - subset was clearly detectable in 11 / 19 individuals , where they ranged from 0 to 10 % of all cd1d - alpha - galcer reactive ( type i ) nkt cells ( fig. 1c ) .
given that type i nkt cells generally represent ~ 0.01 - 0.1 % of peripheral blood lymphocytes , this indicates that these cells are normally quite rare , and in most cases , we could only readily detect them after in vitro enrichment / expansion of cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive cells .
to determine the paired tcr alpha and beta chain usage of these cells , we performed single - cell tcr sequencing and compared gene usage with trav10 + trbv25 - 1 + type i nkt cells sorted from the same donors .
the sequencing results confirmed that there appeared to be two distinct subsets of non - canonical cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive t cells based on tcr gene usage .
one of these exhibited a trav10 - trbv25 - 1 + phenotype , and was only identified within the trav10 - population , whereas the second was trav10 - trbv25 - 1 - , and was present within both the trav10 - and trbv25 - 1 - populations ( table 1 ) .
interestingly , these data also revealed a close association between traj18 and trbv25 - 1 gene usage .
for example , eight out of eight unique trbv25 - 1 + tcr sequences that lacked the trav10 tcr alpha - chain still expressed traj18 .
in contrast , only one out of fourteen unique tcr sequences that were trbv25 - 1 - utilized traj18 ( p < 0.0001 ; fisher 's exact test ) .
instead , this trbv25 - 1 - population displayed a broad spectrum of trav and traj gene usage ( table 1 ) .
thus , from trbv25 - 1 - cells , 13 different tcr alpha - chains utilized trav genes other than trav10 and these paired with a range of traj genes , including traj8 , 24 , 27 , 30 , 44 , 48 and 52 .
these traj segments displayed very limited sequence identity with the traj18 gene segment , and minimal inter - sequence or inter - donor similarity ( table 1 ) .
the cdr1alpha and cdr2alpha loops displayed notable sequence variability , and moreover , on account of variable n - region additions and deletions , the length of the cdr3alpha loop varied from 10 to 14 amino acids among the trbv25 - 1 - subset , compared with the highly restricted cdr3alpha of both the trav10 - trbv25 - 1 + and trav10 + trbv25 - 1 + subsets , where 8 / 8 and 11 / 11 clones , respectively , had an invariant cdr3alpha length of 13 residues ( table 1 ) .
in addition , the tcr beta - chain gene usage was highly diverse , and included trbv2 , 4 - 1 , 6 - 5 , 7 - 8 , 11 - 2 , 12 - 5 , 20 - 1 and 28 , along with diverse cdr3beta sequence and length ( table 1 ) , and no identical clones were identified between separate donors .
accordingly , the cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive t - cell compartment is not only comprised of dominant trav10 + traj18 + trbv25 - 1 + and sub - dominant trav10 - traj18 + trbv25 - 1 + ' public ' repertoires , but in many cases , it also includes diverse trav10 - traj18 - trbv25 - 1 - ' private ' tcr repertoires .
we refer to these latter cells as ' atypical ' nkt cells .
differing patterns of ag reactivity a feature of the type i nkt tcr is that it not only reacts with alpha - galcer , but also imbues reactivity to a range of other self and foreign ligands .
to establish the ag - reactivity profile of atypical nkt cells , we stained cd1d - alpha - galcer tetramer - enriched and expanded pbmc samples from healthy donors with a panel of cd1d - ag tetramers , and compared the trbv25 - 1 + type i and trbv25 - 1 - atypical nkt cells within each donor .
while all type i nkt cells bound to alpha - galcer and alpha - glccer - loaded cd1d , many of the atypical nkt cells failed to stain with alpha - glccer - loaded cd1d tetramers ( fig. 2a ) .
as we have previously published12 , human type i nkt cells exhibited a strong dependence on the 3 ' - oh moiety of alpha - galcer as evidenced by their lack of reactivity to 3 ' - deoxy alpha - galcer .
however , subsets of atypical nkt cells in donors 1 and 4 clearly tolerated this substitution ( fig. 2a ) .
differences between the ag - reactivity profile of type i and atypical nkt cells were also evidenced using the och analogue of alpha - galcer , which has a truncated sphingosine chain .
while this analogue is only poorly recognized by type i nkt cells , some subsets of atypical nkt cells , such as those in donor 1 and donor 3 , still recognized this ag ( fig. 2a ) .
thus , the diverse tcr expression by atypical nkt cells facilitates an altered and mixed pattern of cd1d - ag reactivity compared with type i nkt cells .
to confirm the non - canonical trbv25 - 1 - atypical nkt cell tcrs ( table 1 ) were indeed cd1d - restricted , we generated a panel of jurkat t - cell lines transduced with trbv25 - 1 - tcrs and examined their ability to bind cd1d tetramers loaded with a range of lipid ags .
we selected four trbv25 - 1 - tcrs that represented a cross - section of the tcralpha and tcrbeta chain usage : clones 9c1 ( trav21 + traj8 + trbv7 - 8 + ; table 1 , sequence # 13 ) ; 9b1 ( trav38 - 1 + traj48 + trbv9 ; table 1 , sequence # 1 ) ; 9b2 ( trav12 - 3 + traj27 + trbv6 - 5 + ; table 1 , sequence # 2 ) ; 9b3 ( trav13 - 2 + traj24 + trbv20 - 1 + ; table 1 , sequence # 3 ) and two controls , namely a jurkat phla - specific irrelevant tcr ( trav17 + trbv16 +) and an skw3 trav10 + traj18 + trbv25 - 1 + type i nkt tcr + cell line ( skw3.nkt15 ) ( fig. 2b ) .
as expected , the phla - specific tcr did not bind to cd1d - ag , while the skw3.nkt15 cell line bound to cd1d - alpha - galcer , but not cd1d tetramer loaded with endogenous ags ( fig. 2b ) .
the 9c1 , 9b1 , 9b2 and 9b3 jurkat cell lines all bound to the cd1d - alpha - galcer tetramer , but not to cd1d - endo , thereby confirming the cd1d - restriction and alpha - galcer reactivity of these tcrs isolated from human pbmcs ( fig. 2b ) .
while the skw3.nkt15 cell line could readily bind cd1d - alpha - glccer , the atypical nkt tcrs did not tolerate this substitution , suggesting clear differences in how the atypical nkt tcrs interacted with the glycosyl headgroup compared with type i nkt tcrs ( fig. 2b ) .
similar to the trends in fig. 2a , these cell lines exhibited a differential pattern of reactivity to the alpha - galcer analogues 3 ' - deoxy - alpha - galcer , 4 ' - deoxy - alpha - galcer and och ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
type i nkt cells can recognize beta - linked self - ligands by moulding these ligands into a structural conformation resembling their alpha - linked counterparts , albeit with reduced affinity25 .
notably , in contrast to the type i skw3.nkt15 cell line , we detected clear reactivity of jurkat.9b1 and jurkat.9b2 cell lines to beta - glccer ( fig. 2b ) .
this beta - glccer reactivity , in the absence of alpha - glccer reactivity , is an indication that these atypical nkt tcrs were not reacting with any potential alpha - glccer contamination within the beta - glccer preparation39 .
these 9b1 and 9b2 tcrs also reacted to a lesser extent with beta - galcer ( fig. 2b ) , but none reacted with the type ii nkt cell ligand sulfatide or the ganglioside gd3 ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
in addition , and in contrast to human type i nkt cells , there was no cross - species reactivity of any of these atypical nkt tcrs tcrs towards mouse cd1d - alpha - galcer ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
therefore , non - canonical trbv25 - 1 - nkt cell tcrs are capable of recognizing a diverse array of both alpha - and beta - linked lipid ags , with a spectrum and hierarchy of reactivity that is distinct from typical type i nkt cells .
to test the ag responsiveness of atypical nkt cells , we isolated cd1d - alpha - galcer tetramer + trbv25 - 1 - cells from pbmc by flow cytometric sorting , and then in vitro - expanded these cells with anti - cd3 / cd28 in the presence of irradiated allogeneic pbmc for 2 weeks .
using this approach , seven out of eight donors had a clear population of atypical nkt cells after expansion , as well as the recently described cd1d - alpha - galcer tetramer + trdv1 + delta / alphabeta nkt cells40 ( supplementary fig. 3 ) , with typical yields of ~ 104 - 106 cells for each subset per donor , after expansion .
we re - sorted these populations , along with type i nkt cells ( cd1d - alpha - galcer tetramer + trbv25 - 1 +) and control ( cd1d - alpha - galcer tetramer - ) t cells derived from the same cultures , and measured cytokine production after a 24 h challenge with different lipid ag in the presence of cd1d - expressing apcs .
consistent with their tetramer reactivity , atypical nkt cells from five out of seven donors elicited a clear response following challenge with alpha - galcer , producing both th1 - ( ifn - gamma , il - 2 ) and th2 - ( il - 4 , il - 13 ) type cytokines , compared with control cultures containing apcs alone ( fig. 2c ) .
both type i ( seven out of seven donors ) and delta / alphabeta ( six out of seven donors ) nkt cells responded in a similar fashion , however as expected , the control t cells did not respond to any lipid ag ( none of the seven donors ) despite responding to pma / ionomycin .
consistent with the tetramer - staining patterns , most atypical nkt cells exhibited reduced reactivity to alpha - glccer compared with type i nkt cells .
thus , these data confirm that atypical nkt cells can respond to glycolipid ag presented by cd1d with diverse cytokine production , similar to type i nkt cells .
next , using cd69 upregulation as a marker of functional activation , we examined the ability of the transduced jurkat.nkt cell lines to be activated in the presence of c1r cells expressing cd1d plus defined ag. following overnight co - culture with c1r cells expressing intermediate or high levels of cd1d , but not cd1d - c1r wt cells , all the atypical jurkat.nkt cell lines showed clear signs of activation ( fig. 3a ) .
this was despite no obvious binding to the cd1d - endogenous tetramers ( fig. 2b ) , suggesting the activation assays were more sensitive than the tetramer - based assays .
this also confirmed that these atypical nkt tcrs are capable of initiating cellular activation following tcr ligation by cd1d - ag. addition of graded concentrations of alpha - galcer to these co - cultures resulted in greater activation of the jurkat.9c1 , 9b1 and 9b3 cell lines , yet only appeared to marginally enhance activation of the jurkat.9b2 cell line ( fig. 3b ) .
thus , these data show that non - canonical trbv25 - 1 - atypical nkt cell tcrs confer functional reactivity to cd1d , but they also demonstrate diverse and distinct patterns of ag reactivity compared with trav10 + traj18 + type i nkt cells .
affinity towards cd1d - ag using surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) , we next determined the affinity of two atypical nkt tcrs from clones 9c1 and 9b2 , towards cd1d bound to alpha - galcer and variants thereof .
these two tcrs were selected based on their contrasting ag reactivity profiles , whereby the 9c1 tcr demonstrated a strong dependence on alpha - galcer for activation , whereas the 9b2 tcr , whilst still reactive to cd1d - alpha - galcer tetramers , demonstrated an auto - reactive profile that was associated with less ag - specific activation .
we expressed , refolded and purified the soluble ectodomains of both tcrs to high yields , and passed them over cd1d - ag coupled to a sensor chip .
the 9c1 and 9b2 tcrs did not bind , or bound very poorly , to cd1d - endogenous tetramers respectively , consistent with the tetramer - binding data ( fig. 4 ) .
the 9c1 tcr and 9b2 tcr both bound to cd1d - alpha - galcer with an affinity ( kd ) of 3.9 mum and 4.0 mum respectively , values that , while comparable to many tcr - pmhc interactions , were weaker than the affinity of the canonical type i nkt tcr ( nkt15 ) towards cd1d - alpha - galcer ( kd = 0.19 mum ) ( fig. 4 ) .
the affinity of the 9c1 and 9b2 tcrs towards cd1d - 3 ' - deoxy - alpha - galcer ( kd = 1.4 mum and 3.6 mum , respectively ) was comparable or moderately higher than that of cd1d - alpha - galcer ( fig. 4 ) .
this is in stark contrast to the nkt15 tcr , which bound with much lower affinity to cd1d - 3 ' - deoxy - alpha - galcer ( kd = 4.7 mum , ~ 20 - fold reduction ) ( fig. 4 ) 1226 .
conversely , the 9c1 tcr exhibited a markedly reduced affinity ( kd > 100 mum ) towards the 4 ' - deoxy - alpha - galcer analogue , while there was no negative impact of this analogue on nkt15 or 9b2 tcr binding ( fig. 4 ) .
consistent with tetramer staining and functional studies , alpha - glccer was bound with much lower affinity by 9c1 tcr and 9b2 tcr ( kd > 100 mum and 19 mum , respectively ) , yet was well - tolerated by nkt15 tcr ( kd = 0.12 mum ) ( fig. 4 ) .
the recognition of 4 ' - deoxy - alpha - galcer but not alpha - glccer by 9b2 tcr implies that the equatorial 4 ' - oh group of alpha - glccer may cause a conformational change in cd1d and / or the lipid headgroup , which is not tolerated by 9b2 .
thus , while the atypical nkt tcrs and type i nkt tcrs are reactive towards alpha - galcer , they clearly differ in their fine specificity towards cd1d - restricted ags .
overview of atypical nkt tcr ternary complexes next , to establish how atypical nkt tcr usage manifested in cd1d - ag recognition , we determined the crystal structures of the 9c1 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer and 9b2 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer ternary complexes to 2.5 and 3.1 a resolution , respectively ( supplementary tables 1 - 3 , supplementary fig. 4 ) .
the 9c1 ( fig. 5a ) and 9b2 ( fig. 5b ) tcrs adopted two distinct docking modes atop cd1d - alpha - galcer , both of which markedly contrasted the salient parallel docking mode over the f ' - pocket that is observed for nkt15 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer ( fig. 5c ) and all other type i nkt tcr - cd1d - ag complexes determined to date8 .
the 9c1 tcr docked orthogonally ( 75degrees ) across the a ' - pocket of cd1d , in which the 9c1 tcr alpha - chain was located above the cd1d alpha2 - helix , while the tcr beta - chain was more centrally positioned over the cd1d alpha1 - helix ( fig. 5a ) .
on ligation , the buried surface area ( bsa ) of the 9c1 tcr was ~ 750 a2 , whereupon the tcr alpha - chain contributed the most (~ 460 a2 ) to the 9c1 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer interface ( fig. 5a ) .
we also determined the structure of the 9c1 tcr in the non - liganded state ( supplementary table 1 ) , thereby allowing us to compare the mode , and plasticity of atypical nkt tcr recognition to that of typical type i tcr recognition of cd1d - alpha - galcer ( figs 5 and 6 ) .
the 9c1 tcr did not undergo a major structural rearrangement on cd1d - alpha - galcer engagement , although the cdr3 loops moved to bind the alpha - galcer moiety ( supplementary fig. 4d ) .
the 9b2 tcr also sat over the a ' - pocket of cd1d with a docking angle of ~ 110degrees across the ag - binding cleft ( fig. 5b ) .
thus , while the overall position of the 9b2 tcr alpha - chain was similar to the 9c1 tcr alpha - chain atop cd1d ( centre of mass ( com ) difference of 0.5 a ) ( supplementary fig. 4c ) , the 9b2 tcr beta - chain was located more towards the extreme end of the cd1d a ' - pocket , with a com difference of 13 a and rotational difference of 35degrees compared with the 9c1 tcr beta - chain ( fig. 5b and supplementary fig. 4c ) .
in comparison , the bsa at the 9b2 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer interface was 720 a2 ( fig. 5b ) .
the docking mode of these atypical nkt tcrs were more analogous to the mouse type ii nkt cell xv19 tcr - cd1d - sulfatide ternary complex ( fig. 5d ) , although consistent with the definition of type ii tcrs , xv19 fails to interact with cd1d - alpha - galcer3637 .
accordingly , this represents the first description of how variations in nkt tcr usage can manifest in a markedly different binding mode towards cd1d - alpha - galcer .
atypical nkt tcr interactions with cd1d in the 9c1 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer ternary complex , the cdr3alpha loop ( 35 % bsa ) played a principal role in the interactions ( fig. 5a ) .
notably , the characteristics and conformation of the traj8 - encoded cdr3alpha loop of the 9c1 tcr contrasted that of the polar - rich traj18 - encoded cdr3alpha loop of the nkt15 tcr ( table 1 ) .
the cdr1alpha and cdr2alpha loops of the 9c1 tcr exclusively contacted the cd1d alpha2 - helix , with ser52alpha hydrogen bonding to glu156 , the aliphatic moiety of which contacted tyr31alpha ( fig. 6a left panel , supplementary table 2 ) .
trp153 of cd1d also packed against tyr31alpha , and nestled against the cdr3alpha loop , forming van der waals ( vdw ) contacts with its main chain as well as gln112alpha ( fig. 6a , left panel ) .
here , the cdr3alpha loop contacted residues from the alpha2 - helix ( spanning from trp153 - trp160 ) , and the alpha1 - helix ( spanning thr65 - val72 ) .
as such , the cdr3alpha was wedged within the ag - binding cleft , with thr109alpha stacking against trp160 and hydrogen bonding to thr157 of cd1d , while gln112alpha formed vdw contacts with val72 ( supplementary table 2 ) and hydrogen bonded to his68 of cd1d ( fig. 6a , left panel ) .
the interactions between the 9c1 trbv7 - 8 - encoded tcr beta - chain and cd1d were more limited , being largely dominated by the cdr2beta ( bsa 14 %) and neighbouring framework regions ligating to the alpha1 - helix of cd1d .
here gln57beta and asn58beta hydrogen bonded to ser76 and arg79 of cd1d , respectively , while leu66beta packed against val72 ( fig. 6a , middle panel ) .
in the 9b2 tcr ternary complex , the tcr alpha - chain chain mediated most of the interactions with cd1d - alpha - galcer ( bsa 64 %) , within which the cdr3alpha loop , the characteristics of which are also distinct from the traj18 - encoded cdr3alpha loop , was the principal contributor to the interface ( 32 % bsa ) ( figs 5b , 6b left panel ) .
the cdr1alpha ( bsa 15 %) and cdr2alpha ( bsa 12 %) made exclusive contacts with the alpha2 - helix of cd1d , whereupon tyr32alpha wedged between trp153 and trp160 and hydrogen bonded to thr157 and trp160 ; trp160 also packed against gln31alpha ( fig. 6b left panel ) .
trp153 of cd1d also stacked against tyr57alpha , which occupied the same location as tyr31alpha from the cdr1alpha loop of the 9c1 tcr ( fig. 7 ) .
the cdr2alpha loop interactions were enhanced by the neighbouring framework residue , lys82alpha , salt - bridging to glu156 of cd1d ( supplementary table 3 ) .
central to the cdr3alpha loop - mediated contacts was leu110alpha , which sat within the central axis of the ag - binding cleft and formed vdw contacts with asn62 , leu66 , trp160 and thr165 ( fig. 6b , left panel and supplementary table 3 ) .
supplementing these interactions was ala114alpha , which was packed against the alpha1 - helix and the main chain carbonyls of leu110alpha , and ala114alpha forming hydrogen bonds with asn62 and thr65 of cd1d , while asn111alpha hydrogen bonded to gln168 ( fig. 6b ) .
regarding the 9b2 tcr beta - chain interactions , the cdr3beta loop was the principal contributor to this interface ( bsa 20 %) , as the cdr1beta and cdr2beta loops played lesser roles ( 7 and 5 % bsa respectively ) .
here tyr31beta , val57beta and ile61beta aligned to form a focused interaction site spanning residues 64 - 68 on the alpha1 - helix of cd1d ( supplementary table 3 ) .
the cdr3beta loop was positioned between the alpha1 - and alpha2 - helices , where phe111beta plugged a hydrophobic - lined cavity formed by thr65 , his68 , ile69 and trp160 ( fig. 6b , middle panel ) .
notably , phe111beta and gln112beta of the 9b2 tcr mirrored the position of phe111alpha and gln112alpha , respectively , from the 9c1 tcr ( figs 6b and 7 ) .
in both 9c1 tcr and 9b2 tcr ternary complexes , the three cdralpha loops and the cdr3beta are involved in mediating the cd1d interactions .
this is in clear contrast to the classical nkt15 type i ternary complex , whereby only the cdr3alpha contacted the cd1d molecule while the cdr3beta was not involved in any interactions with cd1d ( fig. 6c , left and middle panels ) .
interestingly , while there were notable differences in the sequences of the 9c1 and 9b2 tcrs and respective interatomic tcr - cd1d contacts , there was nevertheless a degree of focused structural mimicry within these atypical type i nkt tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer ternary complexes ( fig. 7 ) .
thus , atypical and type i nkt tcrs engaged cd1d - alpha - galcer in a markedly different manner .
interactions with alpha - galcer in both the 9c1 and 9b2 tcr ternary complexes , the electron density for alpha - galcer was unambiguous ( supplementary fig. 4a,b ) .
while the positioning of alpha - galcer was very similar within the ternary complexes of the atypical nkt tcr and the type i nkt tcr complexes , the ensuing interactions with the lipid ag were markedly different .
in the 9c1 tcr ternary complex , both the alpha - and beta - chains mediated lipid ag recognition , with direct interactions arising from the cdr3alpha , cdr2beta and cdr3beta loops .
to enable this , the cdr3beta residues ( ser108beta , arg109beta , asp110beta and leu111beta ) and gln112alpha in the cdr3alpha rearranged to accommodate the ag ( supplementary fig. 4d ) .
here , the main chain carbonyl of arg109beta hydrogen bonded to the 4 ' - oh of alpha - galcer , the latter of which also contacted ser31beta via a water - mediated hydrogen bond ( fig. 6a , right panel ) .
further , a water - mediated hydrogen bond between the 3 ' - oh and tyr31alpha was observed .
the 6 ' - oh hydrogen bonded to gln112alpha and gln57beta ( fig. 6a ) and interacted with the framework residue tyr55beta ( supplementary table 2 ) .
while , in the 9b2 tcr ternary complex , the interactions with the alpha - galcer moiety were extremely limited , namely , gln112beta solely contacted the 6 ' - oh of alpha - galcer ( fig. 6b , right panel ) .
both these atypical nkt tcr - alpha - galcer contacts contrasted with that of the type i nkt tcr ternary complex .
here interactions with alpha - galcer were mediated only via the type i nkt tcr alpha - chain , where the 2 ' - oh , 3 ' - oh and 4 ' - oh groups are closely sequestered by the cdr1alpha and cdr3alpha loops , while the 6 ' - oh moiety was solvent exposed ( fig. 6c , right panel ) .
given the fundamental differences in the contacts with ag , we probed the importance of the 9c1 and 9b2 tcr residues that contacted the alpha - galcer moiety .
to establish this , we undertook a mutagenesis / spr approach on the 9c1 and 9b2 tcrs .
for the 9c1 tcr , this included analysing the impact of nine mutants : tyr31alphaala , tyr31alphaphe , gln112alphaala , ser31betaala , tyr55betaala , tyr55betaphe , gln57betaala , arg109betaala and leu111betaala , while for the 9b2 tcr , this involved gln112betaala mutant only ( table 2 ) .
for the 9c1 tcr , while the ser31betaala mutant had no effect , mutations of the residues contacting the 6 ' - oh of alpha - galcer , namely , tyr55betaala , tyr55betaphe , gln112alphaala and gln57betaala impacted on the binding affinity relative to the wild - type 9c1 tcr .
although leu111beta interacted with the c6 and 4 ' - oh of the ag via vdw contacts , the leu111betaala mutation completely ablated cd1d - alpha - galcer recognition .
the effect of this mutant may be attributable to the major role leu111beta plays in contacting cd1d .
interestingly , while the tyr31alphaala mutant abrogated recognition , the tyr31alphaphe 9c1 variant increased the affinity for cd1d - alpha - galcer , presumably by reinforcing the hydrophobic character of the 9c1 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer interface .
for the 9b2 tcr , the gln112betaala mutant resulted in a moderate reduction in affinity , but did not completely ablate binding .
this suggests that mutating gln112beta to ala might enable a compensatory interaction to form via another adjacent residue in the tcrbeta chain ( for example , gln108beta ) ; or alternatively , that the gln112betaala mutant of 9b2 is more permissive for binding of endogenous lipid ags than the wt 9b2 protein , thus resulting in a higher level of autoreactivity .
therefore , contrasting modes of alpha - galcer - centric interactions exist between the atypical nkt tcrs and type i nkt tcrs .
discussion human type i nkt cells are characterized by their expression of the semi - invariant ( trav10 + traj18 + trbv25 - 1 +) tcr and their strong reactivity to alpha - galcer presented by cd1d6 .
the type i nkt tcr resembles a pattern recognition receptor in that a universal docking mode underpins type i nkt tcr - cd1d - ag recognition841 .
our findings reveal that cd1d - alpha - galcer reactive nkt cells neither have to utilize the semi - invariant tcr , nor do they necessarily have to recognize the resultant cd1d - ag complex in the consensus type i nkt tcr - cd1d docking topology .
in humans , the type i nkt tcr recognizes a range of chemically diverse lipid ags by docking over the f ' - pocket of cd1d in a parallel manner42 .
here the invariant tcr alpha - chain contacts cd1d and the ag , whereas the tcr beta - chain contacts cd1d only .
central to this interaction is the traj18 - encoded cdr3alpha loop , a highly polar loop that makes a number of complementary electrostatic interactions with cd1d - alpha - galcer42 .
the importance of the traj18 gene segment for type i nkt cell development is emphasized by the observations that traj18 - deficient mice have markedly impaired nkt cell numbers43 .
however , there are exceptions to the use of the invariant tcr alpha - chain by cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive nkt cells .
for example , populations of mouse trav13 - 3 + traj50 + and human trav10 - traj18 + nkt cells have been described previously172238 .
furthermore , tcr sequencing of human trav10 - nkt cells showed that while most still expressed traj18 , some other traj genes were used in addition to a number of other tcr trbv genes21 , although the specificity of these tcrs was not verified .
thus , while variations in the cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive nkt cell repertoire can impact the functional responses and fine specificity towards some ags , structural analysis of these interactions have nevertheless suggested that they do so under the confines of the consensus footprint on cd1d8 .
as we had previously described a population of cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive trav11 - traj18 - nkt cells in mice19 , we asked whether such a population of cells could exist in humans .
using alpha - galcer , we demonstrated a subset of nkt cells with diverse tcr alpha and beta chain usage .
while diverse nkt tcr usage is generally a feature of type ii nkt cells , the nkt cells identified here were reactive to the prototypic type i nkt cell ag , alpha - galcer .
this meant that these cells could neither be described as type i , nor type ii nkt cells , and hence we presently termed that as atypical nkt cells .
notably , they were distinct from the previously described mouse ' valpha10 ' ( trav13 - 3 +) nkt subset in that they utilized a diverse array of non - canonical tcralpha and tcrbeta chain gene segments , therefore suggesting that no apparent mouse homologue of atypical nkt cells has been described .
the trbv25 - 1 - atypical nkt cells were distinct from type i and other , previously defined trav10 - ( but trbv25 - 1 +) non - canonical nkt cells , in that they also did not utilize the traj18 tcr gene segment .
thus , it appears that traj18 and trbv25 - 1 are strongly associated with , and may dictate , the archetypal type i nkt cell tcr parallel docking footprint , since in their absence the atypical nkt cell tcrs were able to adopt alternate docking strategies .
the basis for the strong association between traj18 and trbv25 - 1 expression is unclear , although these tcr elements dominate the interactions with cd1d - alpha - galcer in type i nkt tcr complexes .
this may indicate that , when used in concert , these tcr motifs preferentially support nkt cell selection criteria during t - cell development , or alternatively , facilitate preferential recognition of a stimulatory sub - class of endogenous ag. these findings also highlight the fact that diverse tcr usage can also be a feature of cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive nkt cells .
notably , similar to type i nkt cells , these atypical nkt cells could respond to glycolipid ag presented by cd1d with diverse cytokine production .
importantly , this repertoire diversity also manifests in differing affinities and functional outcomes towards self - and foreign lipid ags , in that these atypical nkt tcrs appeared to be of lower affinity to the type i nkt tcrs and also exhibited differing fine specificities .
surprisingly , such differences were attributable to the atypical nkt tcrs adopting a footprint on cd1d that was markedly different to that of consensus f ' - pocket docking mode that has consistently been observed for all type i nkt tcrs to date .
namely , two representative atypical nkt tcrs , 9c1 and 9b2 , both adopted distinct docking modes above the a ' - pocket of cd1d , by binding in an orthogonal manner .
these docking modes were reminiscent of the mouse type ii nkt tcr ( clone xv19 ) binding to cd1d presenting sulfatide , and moreover , the distribution of contacts across the cdr loops of these atypical nkt tcrs were more analogous to that of type ii xv19 nkt tcr recognition3637 .
this a ' - pocket docking mode also resonated with the recently described gammadelta tcr - cd1d - ag complexes , although naturally the details of the interatomic contacts differed substantially2244 .
in finding different solutions to interact with cd1d , it was interesting to note that molecular mimicry ' hot spots' underpinned 9c1 and 9b2 tcr recognition .
namely , ' aromatic motifs' within different regions of the tcrs were seen to play analogous roles in contacting cd1d , despite arising from different regions of the respective tcrs .
furthermore , the atypical nkt cell tcrs also adopted differing strategies to interact with alpha - galcer , with interactions via the 6 ' - oh of alpha - galcer featuring prominently in atypical nkt tcr recognition , in stark contrast to typical type i nkt tcr recognition where this motif is not involved in recognition8 .
our studies show that the human alphabeta tcr , delta / alphabeta tcr and gammadelta tcr repertoire is sufficiently flexible to recognize the same ag - presenting molecule displaying the same ag via a number of different mechanisms .
our findings imply that the tcr repertoire provides significant molecular scope for recognition of diverse lipid - based ags in the context of cd1d .
given that alpha - galcer is being explored as a potential immunotherapeutic agent , and numerous analogues of alpha - galcer have been generated to improve the therapeutic efficacy of this drug84546 , it is important that we understand the impact of such modifications on the entire cd1d - alpha - galcer - reactive nkt tcr repertoire .
our findings have radically reshaped our understanding of nkt tcr recognition .

for stimulation assays , 3 x 104 tcr - expressing jurkat - 76 or skw3 cells were co - cultured overnight , with or without 3 x 104 c1r ( either c1r wt , c1r.cd1dint or c1r.cd1dhi ) cells , with graded concentrations of lipid in round - bottom 96 - well plates , and cd19 - cells were analysed by flow cytometry for cd69 expression .
for stimulation assays using primary nkt cells , pbmcs were enriched for cd1d - alpha - galcer - tetramer + cells using magnetic beads as described above , then cd3 + gammadeltatcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer tetramer + trbv25 - 1 +/ - cells were enriched by flow cytometric sorting and cultured for 2 days in the presence of plate - bound anti - cd3 ( ucht1 , 10 mug ml - 1 ) , soluble anti - cd28 ( cd28.2 , 1 mug ml - 1 ) , il - 2 ( 100 u ml - 1 ) , il - 7 ( 50 ng ml - 1 ) , pha ( 0.5 mug ml - 1 ) , 105 irradiated allogeneic pbmc and 2 x 104 irradiated cd1d - expressing k562 cells , and subsequently maintained in media containing il - 2 and il - 7 .

surface plasmon resonance spr experiments were conducted at 25 degreesc on a proteon xpr36 ( bio - rad ) instrument using hbs - t buffer ( 10 mm hepes , ph 7.4 , 150 mm nacl and 0.005 % surfactant p - 20 ) .
biotinylated human cd1d was loaded with alpha - galcer ( c26:0 ) , alpha - glccer ( c26:0 ) , 3 ' - deoxy - alpha - galcer and 4 ' - deoxy - alpha - galcer , and 400 - 600 ru was coupled to a glc sensor chip surface via streptavidin , after which free streptavidin was blocked with an injection of d - biotin .
serial dilutions of purified soluble 9c1 tcr , 9b2 tcr , nkt15 tcr or mutants thereof ( starting tcr concentrations between 19.1 and 128 mum ) were injected at 25 mul per minute for 60 s , simultaneously over test and control ( streptavidin alone ) flow cells , using hbs - t buffer .
data were referenced against the control flow cell and analysed using proteon manager version 2.1 ( bio - rad ) software , and kd , ka and t1 / 2 values derived using a 1:1 langmuir binding model .
for tcr mutant analysis , kd values were normalized against wt tcr kd values .
generation of soluble tcrs and cd1d the individual tcralpha and beta chains of the 9c1 and 9b2 tcrs were synthesized ( integrated dna technologies ) and cloned into the pet30 vector ( novagen ) .
the 9c1 and 9b2 tcr mutants were produced by overlapping extension pcr with primers that included the desired mutations .
the 9c1 and 9b2 wild - type and mutants tcrs were transformed into e. coli bl21 ( de3 ) plyss for expression and produced as inclusion bodies .
both tcrs were subsequently produced by oxidative refolding as previously described and purified by size exclusion chromatography , hydrophobic interaction chromatography and anion exchange chromatography51 .
soluble human cd1d either with or without a c terminus bira biotin ligase tag , along with beta2 - microglobulin , or mouse cd1d and beta2 - microglobulin , were cloned into pfastbac dual ( life technologies ) and expressed by baculovirus infection of high five insect cell lines as previously described5152 .
cd1d was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography using gel filtration ( ge healthcare ) .
structure determination and refinement the 9c1 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer and 9b2 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer complex crystals were obtained in 9 - 10 % peg 6000 / 0.1 m mes ph 6.0 / 4 % ethylene glycol and 18 % peg 8000 / 0.1 m ches ph 9.5 , respectively .
the 9c1 and 9b2 complex crystals were flash - frozen and data were collected at the mx2 beamline ( australian synchrotron ) to 2.5 a and 3.1 a resolution , respectively .
crystals of the 9c1 tcr were obtained in 20 % peg 3000 / 0.2 m na acetate / 0.1 m tris - hcl ph 7.0 and data were collected at the mx1 beamline ( australian synchrotron ) to 1.4 a resolution .
all the data were processed with the programme mosflm and were scaled with the ccp4 suite53 .
the 9c1 and 9b2 complex crystals belonged to the c2 and p212121 space groups , respectively , and the unit cells were consistent with one complex in the asymmetric unit for both complexes .
the 9c1 tcr crystal belonged to the p21 space group .
for the 9c1 tcr , molecular replacement was carried out with the programme phaser54 , using the nkt15 tcr ( pdb code : 2po6 ) .
for the 9c1 - cd1d - alpha - galcer , a molecular replacement solution was found with the programme phaser54 using the structures of human cd1d without the lipid ( pdb code : 2po6 ) and the refined 9c1 tcr minus the cdr loops as two separate search ensembles .
the 9b2 tcr - cd1d - alpha - galcer crystal structure was also determined by molecular replacement ( phaser ) and using human cd1d without the lipid ( pdb code : 2po6 ) and the nkt15 tcr minus the cdr loops as two separate search ensembles .
for the three crystal structures , an initial run of rigid body refinement was performed with the refinement programme buster 2.10 ( ref .
55 ) and the cdr loops of the tcrs were subsequently rebuilt using the programme coot56 .
the density of the alpha - galcer headgroup was unambiguous for both complexes .
after iterative model building with coot and refinement with buster 2.10 , the 9c1 and 9b2 complex structures refinement led to an r / r - free (%) of 20 / 24.9 and 19.5 / 25.5 , respectively , while an r / r - free (%) of 19.6 / 21.7 was obtained for the 9c1 tcr structure .
the quality of the three structures was confirmed at the research collaboratory for structural bioinformatics protein data bank data validation and deposition services website and using the server molprobity57 .
all presentations of molecular graphics were created with the pymol molecular visualization system58 .

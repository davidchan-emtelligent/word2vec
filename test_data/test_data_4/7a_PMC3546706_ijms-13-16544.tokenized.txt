to elucidate the effects of cultivar and harvest month on the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of mulberry leaves , four major phenolics , including chlorogenic acid ( cha ) , benzoic acid ( bea ) , rutin ( rut ) and astragalin ( ast ) , were quantified using an hplc - uv method .
leaves from six mulberry cultivars , collected from april to october , were analyzed .
the antioxidant activity of mulberry leaves was assessed by ferric reducing antioxidant power ( frap ) , hydroxyl radical scavenging activity ( hsa ) and superoxide radical scavenging activity ( ssa ) assays .
the results showed that the total values of the four phenolic compounds ranged from 2.3 dry weight ( dw ) to 4.2 mg / g dw , with cha being the major compound .
the mean total phenol ( tp ) content of the six cultivars ranged from 30.4 equivalents ( gae ) mg / g dw to 44.7 gae mg / g dw. mulberry leaves harvested in may had the highest tp content .
moreover , the antioxidant activities of mulberry leaves harvested from april to october differed noticeably .
in general , kq 10 and may were considered to be a better cultivar and harvest month concerning phenolic content and antioxidant activity , respectively .
phenolics antioxidant activity mulberry leaf cultivar harvest month 1 .
introduction china is the main producer of mulberry ( genus morus ) , an economically important plant used for sericulture .
southern china is the major mulberry growing region in the country , accounting for 30 % of the planted area .
the warm and humid climate of the region allows the mulberry trees to grow continuously for seven months of the year [ 1 ] .
mulberry leaves have been used in china for hundreds of years to treat hyperglycemia , inflammation , cough , hypertension , cancer and fever [ 2,3 ] .
phenolics with strong antioxidant activity toward reactive oxygen species ( ros ) are thought to contribute to the biological activities of the leaves [ 4,5 ] .
although some phenolics , such as rutin , quercetin and isoquercetin , as well as some flavonoids , have been identified in mulberry leaves [ 6 ] , there is currently little information on the influence of cultivar and harvest month on phenolic content and antioxidant activity .
our previous study showed that cultivar and harvest month had a significant effect on the anthocyanin content , some other phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in mulberries [ 7,8 ] .
however , further research is needed .
hence , this work attempts to understand whether the bio - efficacy conferred by phenolics to mulberry leaves is consistent with different cultivars and harvest months [ 6,9,10 ] .
therefore , we investigated the content of four major phenolic compounds ( chlorogenic acid , benzoic acid , rutin and astragalin ) , as well as the antioxidant activity in mulberry leaves , in order to determine the influence of cultivar and harvest month on these variables .
2. results and discussion it is known that genetics , environment and agricultural practices greatly affect the phytochemical profiles of plants ; however , there is limited evidence of the impact of these factors on the bioactivities of mulberry leaves .
such information would help farmers to select cultivar ( s ) and a harvest time to produce mulberry leaves and related products with the greatest levels of compounds with antioxidant , anti - inflammatory and anti - diabetic activities .
2.1 .
effect of cultivar on phenolics and antioxidant activity of mulberry leaves the mean contents of four phenols ( cha , bea , rut and ast ) in the leaf extract of six mulberry cultivars , harvested over seven consecutive months , ranged from 2.32 mg / g dw to 4.17 mg / g dw. in particular , cha was the major compound , representing over 44.9 % of the total , while rut , ast and bea were relatively low ( table 1 ) .
this result was in agreement with previous reports on japanese mulberry leaves by onogi et al .
[ 10 ] , katsube et al .
[ 11 ] and matsuoka et al .
[ 9 ] .
moreover , the data showed that the rut content ( 1.20 +/ - 0.4 mg / g dw ) in kq 10 and the bea content ( 0.8 +/ - 0.2 mg / g dw ) in ys 10 were significantly higher than other cultivars .
ys 10 had relatively high levels of the four phenolic compounds with 2.1 +/ - 0.6 mg / g dw cha , 0.7 +/ - 0.2 mg / g dw rut , 0.8 +/ - 0.2 mg / g dw bea and 0.6 +/ - 0.2 mg / g dw ast , while kq 10 possessed relatively high level of rut ( 1.2 +/ - 0.4 mg / g dw ) and cha ( 2.2 +/ - 0.6 mg / g dw ) .
the profiles of the four quantified phenols were different among six cultivars and consistent with the study by song et al .
[ 12 ] .
conversely , da 10 had lower levels of the four phenolic compounds compared with the other cultivars , which was in disagreement with the results of song et al .
[ 12 ] , who suggested it to be the most valuable mulberry cultivar based on its high content of functional components .
the total phenol ( tp ) values in six mulberry cultivars ranged from 30.4 gae mg / g dw to 44.7 gae mg / g dw , with the highest tp in kq 10 ( 44.7 +/ - 10.7 gae mg / g dw ) and the lowest in ns 14 ( 30.4 +/ - 6.3 gae mg / g dw ) ( table 2 ) .
these results were in agreement with those reported by jia et al .
[ 6 ] , who described a wide variation in the flavonoid contents of the leaves of 13 mulberry varieties , ranging from 9.8 mg / g dw to 29.6 mg / g dw rut equivalents .
the hydroxyl radical scavenging activity ( hsa ) and superoxide radical scavenging activity ( ssa ) values did fluctuate among six cultivars , with the highest hsa and ssa in kq 10 and the lowest in ns 14 .
however , ferric reducing antioxidant power ( frap ) values did not vary a lot .
in general , the antioxidant activities of the leaves from six mulberry cultivars varied considerably .
canonical discriminant analysis showed an obvious variability among the six cultivars , especially between kq 10 and the other five cultivars ( figure 1a ) .
kq 10 only possess a significantly higher content of rut , which implies it probably plays a very important role in the antioxidant activity of mulberry leaf .
differences among the mulberry cultivars could further explain why the corresponding leaf samples had significant differences on their phenolic content and antioxidant activity .
canonical discriminant analysis has also been used to differentiate cultivars and fertilization types in wines [ 13,14 ] , olives [ 15 ] , grapes [ 16 ] and almonds [ 17 ] .
further experiments showed that the tp content was significantly correlated with frap ( r2 = 0.66 ) , hsa ( r2 = 0.75 ) and ssa ( r2 = 0.56 ) ( p <= 0.01 ) ( table 3 ) .
the results were consistent with widely accepted knowledge that phenolics contribute to the antioxidant activity of plants .
isabelle et al .
[ 18 ] reported strong correlations between radical scavenging capacities and the content of phenolic compounds in mulberry fruits .
a similar result was reported by ozgen et al .
[ 19 ] .
furthermore , katsube et al .
[ 20 ] indicated that flavonoids in mulberry leaves were the main antioxidants protecting ldl against in vitro copper - induced oxidation .
the correlation results showed that cha and rut contributed to the antioxidant activity of mulberry leaves , as determined by frap and hsa .
it is known that both genotype and growing environment can affect phytochemical production in an interactive manner .
since all the samples were collected from the same orchard , the differences could not be ascribed to growing location , environment or agricultural practice .
thus , only the cultivar difference had an impact on the phenolic content and antioxidant activity , rather than the growing environment ( supplementary table s1 ) .
2.2 .
effect of harvest month on phenolics and antioxidant activity of mulberry leaves leaves from six mulberry cultivars , collected from april to october in southern china , were used to investigate the influence of harvest month on phenolics and antioxidant activity .
cha was the major phenolic compound and its concentration did not change significantly over seven harvest months .
a similar trend was observed for bea and rut .
however , the content of ast was markedly affected by harvest month , with its concentration reaching the highest level in august ( table 4 ) .
further canonical discriminant analysis showed that the effect of harvest month was less obvious than that of cultivar ( figure 1b ) , which could further explain the above result .
the mulberry tree is a fast - growing deciduous plant that can grow under different climatic conditions ( i.e. , tropical , subtropical and temperate ) [ 21 ] .
the compendium of materia medica , a pharmaceutical text written by li shi - zhen during the ming dynasty , indicated that mulberry leaves harvested before natural defoliation in autumn ( october ) were the best for medicinal use , but no explanation was provided .
guan et al .
[ 22 ] also indicated that mulberry leaves harvested in autumn would exert larger bio - efficacy than those harvested in summer , probably because of the higher rutin content of the former .
in general , the growing period of mulberry plants is four - to - seven months , dependent on climate condition and cultivar .
jia et al .
[ 6 ] reported that the flavonoid contents of mulberry leaves collected in spring and autumn were different .
nevertheless , our study is the first to monitor the changes in phenolic contents and antioxidant activities in mulberry leaves over seven months of the growing season .
our results showed that mulberry leaves harvested in may contained more tp and had a stronger antioxidant activity than those collected in april .
however , there were differences in the levels of the four phenolic compounds during the growing season .
the contents of cha and bea were unaltered during the whole growing season , but the contents of rut and ast increased continuously .
however , the most bioactive constituents in mulberry leaves , responsible for their putative health benefits , remain to be investigated .
the higher contents of tp and cha , as well as the stronger antioxidant activity observed in the early harvest season , suggest that mulberry leaves collected in may are the best for medicinal use , which disagrees with both the recommendation given in the compendium of materia medica and the study by jia et al .
[ 6 ] .
this study also showed that the harvest month significantly affected the tp content and the frap and ssa activities , but not the hsa activity .
after reaching their highest levels in may , tp , frap and ssa declined in later harvest months ( table 5 ) .
3. experimental section 3.1 .
materials cha , rut ( quercetin - 3 - o - rutinoside ) , bea and ast ( kaempferol - 3 - o - glucoside ) were purchased from the national institutes for food and drug control ( beijing , china ) .
all other chemicals and reagents were from guangzhou chemical reagent factory ( guangzhou , china ) .
3.2 .
mulberry leaf samples tang 10 ( t 10 ) , kangqing 10 ( kq 10 ) , beidong 2 ( bd 2 ) , yu 7803 , yuesang 10 ( ys 10 ) and nongsang 14 ( ns 14 ) are six typical cultivars widely grown in southern china .
all the mulberry plants for this study were cultivated in an experimental field in guangzhou , which was managed by the sericulture & agri - food research institute of the guangdong academy of agricultural sciences .
leaves from each mulberry cultivar were harvested from the same trees once a month over seven consecutive months of the growing period ( april to october ) in 2009 .
a total of 42 mulberry leaf samples were collected .
the specimen identities were confirmed by cui - ming tang , a mulberry taxonomist from the sericulture & agri - food research institute .
the mulberry leaves were shade dried , powdered using an electric grinder and stored at - 20 degreesc until extraction .
3.3 .
mulberry leaf extraction phenols in mulberry leaf powder were extracted using 70 % ethanol in water ( ph 4 ) , according to our previously published protocol [ 23 ] .
briefly , 1 g of mulberry leaf powder was mixed with 40 ml of acidified ethanol solution and then extracted using sonication for 30 min at room temperature .
after centrifugation , the solvent was removed using a rotavapor over a water bath below 40 degreesc .
the dried extracts were stored at - 20 degreesc .
before conducting the assays , the mulberry leaf extract ( mle ) was reconstituted with 25 ml of distilled water to produce a concentration equivalent to 40 mg / ml of mulberry leaf powder .
3.4 .
determination of four phenolic compounds by hplc thirteen phenolic compounds from mulberry leaves were previously quantified in our laboratory using hplc .
among them , chlorogenic acid , benzoic acid , rutin and astragalin were the predominant compounds , accounting for 76.4 % - 88.3 % of the total ( supplementary table s2 ) .
some individual compounds , such as cat , vaa , caa , gaa , hyp and que , were not present in all the cultivars .
moreover , detection and quantification of rut is the only detective index required for the quality control of mulberry leaf [ 3 ] .
therefore , four main phenols , including cha , rut , bea and ast , were quantified using an agilent 1200 series hplc ( agilent technologies inc. , karlsruhe , germany ) equipped with a zorbax sb - c18 column ( 250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d. , 5 mum ) and an agilent photodiode array detector .
the mobile phase was 0.4 % acetic acid ( mpa ) : acetonitrile ( mpb ) , pumped at 1 ml / min in a linear gradient mode , with 5 % - 25 % mpb ( 0 - 40 min ) , 25 % - 35 % mpb ( 40 - 45 min ) , 35 % - 50 % mpb ( 45 - 50 min ) , and 50 % - 55 % mpb ( 50 - 55 min ) .
the column was kept at 30 degreesc , and the injection volume was 20 mul .
the phenolic compounds were monitored at 280 nm , and their concentrations were calculated based on the standard curves constructed with authentic standards .
concentration was expressed as mg / g dw .
3.5 .
total phenols in mle total phenols ( tp ) in water - reconstituted mulberry leaf extract ( mle ) were determined by the method of chen et al .
[ 24 ] , and the results were expressed as gallic acid equivalents ( gae ) mg / g dw .
3.6 .
frap assay the frap value of water - reconstituted mle was determined via a redox - linked reduction of fe3 + - 2,4,6 - tripyridyl - s - triazine to a blue - colored fe2 + complex at ph 3.5 , according to the method of chen et al .
[ 24 ] .
mle was incubated with the frap reagent for 1 h at room temperature .
the absorbance was measured at 593 nm , using a shimadzu uv1700 spectrophotometer ( shimadzu instruments manufacturing , co. , ltd , suzhou , china ) .
the frap value was expressed as mmol trolox equivalents ( te )/ 100 g dw .
3.7 .
superoxide radical scavenging activity ( ssa ) ssa was measured in a xanthine / xanthine oxidase system with spectrophotometric determination of the reduction product of nitroblue tetrazolium ( nbt ) , according to the method described by chun et al .
[ 25 ] , with slight modifications .
briefly , water - reconstituted mle was incubated with a reaction mixture of 50 mumol / l nbt , 50 mumol / l xanthine and 0.05 u / ml xanthine oxidase ( final concentrations ) for 10 min at room temperature , and then , the change in absorbance of nbt was measured at 560 nm using a shimadzu uv1700 spectrophotometer .
the ssa was expressed as a percentage of the control , which did not contain antioxidants , based on the following equation : ( 1 ) scavenging activity (%)=( 1 - asample560 / acontrol560 ) x100 % 3.8 .
hydroxyl radical scavenging activity ( hsa ) hsa of water - reconstituted mle was assessed using the hydroxyl radical system generated by the fenton reaction , according to the method of heo et al .
[ 26 ] with minor modifications .
briefly , 1 ml of water - reconstituted mle was added to a reaction mixture of 1 ml brilliant green ( 0.435 mmol / l ) , 0.5 ml feso4 ( 2 mmol / l ) and 1.5 ml h2o2 ( 3 %) .
after 20 min of incubation at room temperature , the absorbance was measured at 624 nm , using a shimadzu uv1700 spectrophotometer .
the hsa was expressed as percentage of the control , which did not contain antioxidants , based on the following equation : ( 2 ) scavenging activity (%)=( 1 - asample624 / acontrol624 ) x100 % 3.9 .
statistics and data analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss ( version 17 , spss inc. , chicago , il , usa , 2008 ) .
the results were expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) .
one - way anova was performed to determine the effect of cultivar or harvest month , followed by the tukey - kramer hsd test , with which the significance was obtained .
a p - value <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
the pearson 's correlation was performed between all study outcomes .
canonical discriminant analysis ( cda ) was performed using sas ( version 9.1.3 , sas institute inc. , cary , nc , usa , 2002 ) with standard pooled variance and 80 % confidence ellipses .
cultivar and harvest month were independently modeled using cha , rut , bea , ast , total phenol , frap , hsa and ssa .
4. conclusions there were significant variations in the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of leaves from six mulberry cultivars , collected over seven months .
as all mulberry plants were cultivated in the same orchard , the differences could not be ascribed to growing location , environment or agricultural practice , but to genotype and maturation of leaves .
our data suggest that kq 10 and may are the better cultivar and harvest month , respectively , in the context of phenolic content and antioxidant activity .
our results can help farmers to select a cultivar and harvest month that would allow them to produce mulberry leaves with superior quality .
more work is needed to examine potential differences in the bio - efficacy of mulberry leaves from different cultivars and harvest months .
furthermore , more information is needed on the impact of processing and storage on the bioactivities of mulberry leaves .

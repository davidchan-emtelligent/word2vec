introduction interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) are up - regulated in injured and osteoarthritic knee joints .
il - 1 and tnf - alpha inhibit integrative meniscal repair ; however , the mechanisms by which this inhibition occurs are not fully understood .
transforming growth factor - beta1 ( tgf - beta1 ) increases meniscal cell proliferation and accumulation , and enhances integrative meniscal repair .
an improved understanding of the mechanisms modulating meniscal cell proliferation and migration will help to improve approaches for enhancing intrinsic or tissue - engineered repair of the meniscus .
the goal of this study was to examine the hypothesis that il - 1 and tnf - alpha suppress , while tgf - beta1 enhances , cellular proliferation and migration in cell and tissue models of meniscal repair .
methods a micro - wound assay was used to assess meniscal cell migration and proliferation in response to the following treatments for 0 , 24 , or 48 hours : 0 to 10 ng / ml il - 1 , tnf - alpha , or tgf - beta1 , in the presence or absence of 10 % serum .
proliferated and total cells were fluorescently labeled and imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy and the number of proliferated , migrated , and total cells was determined in the micro - wound and edges of each image .
meniscal cell proliferation was also assessed throughout meniscal repair model explants treated with 0 or 10 ng / ml il - 1 , tnf - alpha , or tgf - beta1 for 14 days .
at the end of the culture period , biomechanical testing and histological analyses were also performed .
statistical differences were assessed using an anova and newman - keuls post hoc test .
results il - 1 and tnf - alpha decreased cell proliferation in both cell and tissue models of meniscal repair .
in the presence of serum , tgf - beta1 increased outer zone cell proliferation in the micro - wound and in the cross section of meniscal repair model explants .
both il - 1 and tnf - alpha decreased the integrative shear strength of repair and extracellular matrix deposition in the meniscal repair model system , while tgf - beta1 had no effect on either measure .
conclusions meniscal cell proliferation in vivo may be diminished following joint injury due to the up - regulation of inflammatory cytokines , thereby limiting native cellular repair of meniscal lesions .
therefore , therapies that can promote meniscal cell proliferation have promise to enhance meniscal repair and improve tissue engineering strategies .
introduction the menisci are c - shaped fibrocartilaginous tissues located between the femoral condyles and tibial plateau in the knee .
they provide load bearing capabilities , lubrication , proprioception , joint congruity and joint stability for normal biomechanical function of the knee joint [ 1 - 4 ] .
damage to and loss of function of the menisci through sports - related [ 5 ] or degenerative tears are associated with pain and degradative changes in the knee joint that ultimately lead to osteoarthritis ( oa ) [ 6 - 11 ] .
approximately two - thirds of patients with meniscal tears develop radiographic knee oa within 5 to 15 years of injury [ 12 ] .
partial excisions and total meniscectomies for the treatment of meniscal tears are strongly associated with articular cartilage loss and the progression of oa [ 6 - 11 ] .
therefore , current orthopaedic practice aims to preserve meniscal integrity and restore function .
the success of clinical repairs depends on a number of factors including age , time to surgery , and the type and location of the meniscal tear .
in general , repairs involving the outer one - third of the meniscus , the vascularized " red - red zone " , have the highest likelihood of success [ 13 ] .
repairs are less favorable in the inner two - thirds of the meniscus , the avascular " white - white zone " [ 13,14 ] .
however , in vitro studies of integrative repair suggest that the intrinsic repair capabilities of the outer and inner zones are similar , supporting the hypothesis that the in vivo presence of vasculature aids in the repair of the outer zone [ 15 ] .
nonetheless , differences in extracellular matrix and cell composition between the inner and outer zones may also influence repair .
the outer zone contains fibroblast - like cells [ 16,17 ] that produce predominantly type i collagen [ 18 - 20 ] .
the inner zone consists of fibrochondrocyte - like cells [ 16,17 ] , both type i and ii collagen [ 18,20 ] , and increased aggrecan content relative to the outer zone [ 14 ] .
meniscal plugs from the outer zone inserted into inner zone tissue demonstrate enhanced healing , suggesting that repair capability is related to the intrinsic healing potential of the outer region , rather than the vasculature alone [ 21 ] .
the integrative repair of meniscal lesions is associated with increased cell accumulation in the repair site [ 22 - 27 ] .
however , the respective roles of cell proliferation and migration in integrative repair , and the influence of soluble mediators on these processes are not fully understood .
an in vivo canine model consisting of a fibrin clot surgically inserted into an avascular meniscal defect showed that the clot functioned as a scaffold for cell migration and a chemotactic stimulus for cell proliferation [ 28 ] .
furthermore , cells can migrate into an acellular meniscal plug in vivo and remodel the tissue [ 29 ] .
an important factor that may strongly influence meniscal repair is the inflammatory environment within the joint .
the inflammatory cytokines interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) are up - regulated in injured and oa knee joints [ 30 - 33 ] .
in addition , il - 1 and tnf - alpha decrease integrative meniscal repair in vitro by increasing matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) activity , sulfated glycosaminoglycan ( s - gag ) release , and nitric oxide ( no ) production , while simultaneously decreasing cell accumulation and tissue formation at the meniscal repair interface , and ultimately compromising the shear strength of repair [ 23 - 27,34 ] .
initial acute exposure to il - 1 for 1 to 3 days potently suppresses meniscal repair for at least 28 days [ 27 ] , suggesting that the initial inflammatory environment in a joint post - injury may have long - term degenerative effects .
in addition , il - 1 and tnf - alpha activate other degradative and pro - inflammatory pathways in the meniscus and other joint tissues [ 30,31,35 - 37 ] .
while many of the potentially negative effects of il - 1 and tnf - alpha on meniscal repair have been established at the molecular and tissue levels , the specific effects of these proinflammatory cytokines on meniscal cell migration and proliferation are currently unclear , and several in vitro studies have reported conflicting results .
in one study , different concentrations of il - 1 caused increased cell migration as compared to controls in bovine meniscal cells isolated from the outer and middle meniscal zones [ 38 ] .
conversely , studies with porcine meniscal repair model tissue explants treated with either il - 1 or tnf - alpha show decreased cell accumulation in the repair interface without a decrease in cell viability , potentially due to a reduction in cell proliferation and / or migration at the repair site [ 23,25 - 27 ] .
anabolic growth factors have been studied as therapeutics to enhance healing of meniscal injuries .
the anabolic growth factor transforming growth factor - beta1 ( tgf - beta1 ) has been shown to increase meniscal cell proliferation in several in vitro models , including monolayer , explant culture , and meniscal cells seeded on poly - l - lactide ( plla ) scaffolds and three - dimensional collagen sponges [ 39 - 43 ] .
in vitro meniscal repair model explants treated with tgf - beta1 showed increased cell accumulation in the repair interface and increased integrative repair [ 24,44 ] .
in the presence of il - 1 , tgf - beta1 increased the interfacial shear strength of repair compared to il - 1 alone , overcoming some of the potent catabolic effects of il - 1 [ 24 ] .
bovine meniscal cells transduced with vectors expressing tgf - beta1 and seeded into the avascular inner zone of the meniscus showed increased cellularity and proteoglycan and collagen synthesis [ 45 ] .
furthermore , meniscal cells treated with either 10 or 100 ng / ml tgf - beta1 showed marked changes in cell morphology , resulting in a phenotype more similar to fibroblast - like cells [ 39 ] .
the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of the inflammatory cytokines il - 1 and tnf - alpha , and the growth factor tgf - beta1 on proliferation and migration during cell - mediated repair of the meniscus .
we hypothesized that il - 1 and tnf - alpha suppress cellular proliferation and migration of both inner and outer zone meniscal cells , while tgf - beta1 enhances cell proliferation and migration of both inner and outer zone cells , in cell and tissue models of meniscal repair .
we assessed cell migration and proliferation using a micro - wound assay with isolated inner and outer zone meniscal cells treated with il - 1 , tnf - alpha or tgf - beta1 .
cells were fluorescently labeled to identify newly proliferated and total cells and were imaged over time to assess the contribution of proliferated and migrated cells to wound healing .
additionally , cell proliferation was assessed in inner and outer zone meniscal repair model explants [ 15,23,25 - 27,34 ] treated with il - 1 , tnf - alpha or tgf - beta1 for 14 days .
meniscus healing was investigated by mechanical testing of the repair model explants to determine the interfacial shear strength and histology was performed to visualize tissue repair and cell viability .
materials and methods meniscal cell isolation medial menisci were aseptically isolated from the knee joints of skeletally mature , two - to three - year - old female pigs obtained from a local abattoir .
the menisci were trimmed to remove all ligamentous and synovial tissue and separated into the inner two - thirds and outer one - third zones [ 14 ] .
meniscal cells from the inner and outer zones were enzymatically isolated from the tissue by sequential digestion with 1,320 puk / ml pronase ( calbiochem , san diego , ca , usa ) followed by 0.4 % collagenase type i ( worthington , lakewood , nj , usa ) for three hours , as previously described [ 46 ] .
after enzymatic isolation , the cells were filtered through a 70 mum filter ( bd biosciences , bedford , ma , usa ) and washed three times in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium high glucose ( dmem with 4.5 g / l d - glucose ; invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) containing 1,000 units / ml penicillin / streptomycin and 2.5 mug / ml amphotericin b ( invitrogen ) .
cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells / ml in culture media composed of dmem , 10 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; hyclone , logan , ut , usa ) , 0.1 mm non - essential amino acids ( invitrogen ) , 10 mm 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer solution ( hepes ; invitrogen ) , 100 units / ml penicillin / streptomycin , and 37.5 mug / ml l - ascorbic acid 2 - phosphate ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
cells were seeded at a final concentration of 2 x 106 cells per well in a two - well chambered coverglass slide ( nalge nunc international , rochester , ny , usa ) that was coated overnight with 50 mug / ml bovine type i collagen ( trevigen , gaithersburg , md , usa ) in phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ; mediatech , manassas , va , usa ) .
cells were incubated for 72 hours at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 .
micro - wounding of meniscal cells we utilized a micro - wound assay , or scratch test , as described previously [ 47 - 49 ] to assess meniscal cell migration and proliferation in monolayer culture ( n = three or more wells per treatment group , each from a different animal ) .
cells were serum - starved for one hour in serum free culture media ( no fbs but contained 2 mg / ml bovine serum albumin ( bsa ; invitrogen ) [ 38 ]) .
after serum starvation , a single vertical scratch was made in the center of each well with a 200 mul yellow plastic pipette tip ( usa scientific , ocala , fl , usa ) to remove all cells and generate a micro - wound .
immediately , cell debris and media were aspirated and fresh serum free culture media was added containing 10 mum 5 - ethylnyl - 2 ' - deoxyuridine ( edu from the click - it ( tm ) edu alexa fluor ( r ) 488 imaging kit ; invitrogen ) , to label dna in proliferating cells , and the treatments listed in table 1 .
cells were incubated at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 for 0 , 24 , or 48 hours then fixed with 3.8 % formaldehyde ( vwr international , west chester , pa , usa ) , and permeabilized with 0.5 % triton x - 100 ( sigma - aldrich ) .
edu detection was performed using the manufacturer 's protocol for the click - it edu alexa fluor 488 imaging kit to label proliferated cells .
cells were washed in tris ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( te ) , ph 7.4 , stained for 30 minutes in the dark with 1 mum syto ( r ) 82 nucleic acid stain ( invitrogen ) to label all cells , and washed three times with te. table 1 treatments for micro - wounding experiments treatments concentrations vendor serum 0 , 1 % , 5 % , 10 % hyclone ( logan , ut , usa ) recombinant porcine il - 1alpha 0 , 0.1 ng / ml , 1 ng / ml , 10 ng / ml r & d systems ( minneapolis , mn , usa ) recombinant porcine tnf - alpha 0 , 0.1 ng / ml , 1 ng / ml , 10 ng / ml r & d systems ( minneapolis , mn , usa ) porcine tgf - beta1 0 , 0.1 ng / ml , 1 ng / ml , 10 ng / ml r & d systems ( minneapolis , mn , usa ) 10 % serum and factors 10 % serum hyclone ( logan , ut , usa ) 10 % serum + 10 ng / ml il - 1 see above 10 % serum + 10 ng / ml tnf - alpha see above 10 % serum + 10 ng / ml tgf - beta1 see above hyclone ( logan , ut , usa ) ; r & d systems ( minneapolis , mn , usa ) cells were visualized and photographed using a laser scanning confocal microscope ( lsm 510 , carl zeiss , inc. , thornwood , ny , usa ) .
to visualize proliferated cells , an excitation wavelength of 488 nm was used and fluorescence was collected at 505 to 530 nm. total cells were detected by excitation at 543 nm and fluorescence was collected at > 585 nm. in order to visualize a single cell layer , an optical slice of 15 mum was utilized .
for each sample , the micro - wound was centered in the field of view and four images at different vertical positions along the scratch were obtained .
micro - wounding image analysis the confocal images were exported as separate green and red channel images from the zeiss lsm image browser software ( carl zeiss , inc. ) .
collected images were analyzed using a custom matlab ( mathworks , natick , ma , usa ) script .
briefly , each of the four green and red channel images for each sample was thresholded using optimal threshold values that were determined for the green and red channels individually .
these images were then converted to a binary image to identify labeled cells .
images were sub - divided into 32 32 - pixel regions and the number of cells within each region was counted .
cell counts from all regions were summed across the four images to yield the total number of cells ( red ) and the total number of proliferating cells ( green ) for each sample .
the total number of migrating cells that did not proliferate was the difference between the two channels .
to assess cell migration and proliferation in the micro - wound , cell counts were averaged across the two center strips and to assess cell proliferation at the edge , cell counts from the green channel images were averaged across the four peripheral strips at the far left and right edges of the image .
the total cell counts at the edges were also measured on day 0 images to establish the starting cell density for each meniscal cell population .
all data are expressed as a percentage of the starting cell density .
in the micro - wounding assay , all cells that accumulate in the gap have migrated into the wound from the edge .
therefore , all cells that are described as proliferated in the gap have in fact both migrated and proliferated .
however , the order in which these cellular activities occurred could not be assessed .
cells that are described as migrated have , therefore , only migrated into the wound and did not proliferate .
meniscal repair model system a previously described meniscal repair model system [ 15,23 - 27 ] was used to assess in vitro integrative meniscal repair ( n = four or more per treatment group , all from different animals ) .
cylindrical 5 mm biopsy punches ( miltex , york , pa , usa ) were harvested perpendicular to the femoral surface of the meniscus from the inner two - thirds and outer one - third of the tissue .
explants were cut parallel to the meniscal surface with a scalpel to a uniform thickness of 2.5 mm using a custom - made cutting block .
to simulate a full - thickness tear , a 3 mm biopsy punch ( miltex ) was utilized to make a concentric core in the explant , which was removed and immediately reinserted in the original orientation .
explants were placed in a 24 - well plate with dmem containing 1,000 units / ml penicillin / streptomycin for one hour at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 .
explants were incubated in the culture media described above for isolated meniscal cells .
for cell proliferation experiments , all media included 10 mum edu .
explants were randomly assigned to one the following treatment groups : control , 10 ng / ml il - 1alpha , 10 ng / ml tnf - alpha or 10 ng / ml tgf - beta1 .
media were changed every 3 days , and explants were cultured for a total of 14 days at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 .
cell proliferation analyses in meniscal repair explants on day 14 , explants were transected vertically to allow visualization of cells throughout the cross section .
explants were labeled using a modified protocol based on the click - it ( tm ) edu alexa fluor ( r ) 488 imaging kit .
briefly , explants were fixed with 3.8 % formaldehyde for 30 minutes , permeabilized with 0.5 % triton x - 100 for 30 minutes , and tagged with the alexa fluor dye to label all proliferated cells .
to stain all cells , explants were washed in te , ph 7.4 , stained for 30 minutes in the dark with 1 mum syto ( r ) 82 nucleic acid stain , and then washed three times with te. cells were visualized and photographed using a confocal laser scanning microscope as described above for the micro - wounding assay .
images were collected more than 50 mum into the face of the sample to ensure that cells damaged during transection were excluded [ 50 ] .
two images per location were collected from the outer ring , inner core and repair interface for both the surface and cross section of the explants .
meniscal repair model explant image analysis data were collected from different areas of the surface and cross - section of the meniscal repair model explants .
measured areas were outlined in zeiss lsm image browser ( carl zeiss ) .
the surface interface included a 50 mum region on either side of the interface , inclusive of the interface , at the surface of the tissue .
the surface region of the tissue included images from both the inner core and outer ring that were outside this defined interface region .
for cross section images , the tissue was divided into three distinct layers based on distance from the surface and cell morphology .
the first 50 mum from the surface was defined as the " superficial zone ," the next 100 mum was defined as the " middle zone ," and the next 300 mum was termed the " deep zone. " the cross section interface included a 50 mum region on either side of the interface , inclusive of the interface , for each of these three layers .
the cross section of the tissue included images of the cross section from both the inner core and outer ring that were outside the defined interface region .
confocal images were exported as separate green and red channel images and saved as tiff files .
the images were gray - scaled using adobe photoshop and processed using scion image ( scion corp. , frederick , md , usa ) to invert , subtract background by removing 2d streaks , and smooth .
optimal threshold values were determined for the green and red channels individually .
proliferated cells ( green ) and total cell ( red ) counts were obtained using intensity thresholds of 75 and 40 , respectively , and a minimum particle size of five .
cell counts were obtained for each of the defined regions in the surface and cross sectional planes .
percent cell proliferation was calculated by dividing the number of proliferated cells ( green ) by the number of total cells ( red ) in each sample and multiplying by 100 percent .
biomechanical testing to assess shear strength of repair on day 14 , shear strength of repair between the outer ring and inner core of meniscal repair explants was measured with a push - out test [ 15,23 - 27 ] using an electroforce ( elf ) 3200 materials testing system ( bose - enduratec corporation , eden prairie , mn , usa ) .
briefly , explants were centered in a custom - made apparatus , such that the 3 mm inner core was centered over a 4 mm concentric hole in the bottom of the dish .
a 2 mm diameter rod attached to a load cell displaced the inner core at a rate of 0.0833 mm / s until the inner core was dislodged from the outer ring .
the force required for displacement was recorded over time .
following the push out test , the inner core was imaged using a digital video camera ( sony electronics , park ridge , nj , usa ) with a 94 - mm video lens ( infinity , boulder , co , usa ) to measure the inner core thickness using labview vision builder ai ( national instruments corporation , austin , tx , usa ) .
shear strength of repair ( in kpa ) was calculated by dividing the peak force measured during the push out test by the surface area of the interface .
histological staining of meniscal explants on day 12 of the meniscal repair model explant culture , 0.05 % nitroblue tetrazolium chloride ( nbt ; invitrogen ) was added to the explant culture media for histological analyses .
nbt is a cell - permeable compound that is reduced by live cells to form a blue formazan product that remains stable to histological processing and paraffin embedding and has been documented as a live cell marker for chondrocytes [ 51,52 ] .
at day 14 , explants were fixed overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( electron microscopy sciences , hatfield , pa , usa ) , containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate trihydrate ( electron microscopy sciences ) , ph 7.4 at 4degreesc .
samples were dehydrated in etoh , infiltrated with xylene , and paraffin embedded .
sections were stained with 0.02 % aqueous fast green ( sigma - aldrich ) to label collagens and accustain safranin o solution ( sigma - aldrich ) to identify proteoglycans .
statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed using statistica 7.0 ( statsoft inc. , tulsa , ok , usa ) .
a factorial analysis of variance ( anova ) and the newman - keuls post hoc test were performed to determine significant differences ( alpha = 0.05 ) and the interactive effect of time and treatment in the micro - wounding experiments .
in the meniscal repair model explant studies , the interactive effect of treatment and tissue zone ( inner and outer ) in the surface images and push - out test and of treatment , tissue zone and cross section layer ( superficial , middle , and deep ) in the cross section images were also determined using a factorial anova and newman - keuls post - hoc test .
results the effects of serum on inner and outer zone micro - wound repair serum treatment of meniscal cells from both the inner ( figure 1a ) and outer zones ( figure 1c ) resulted in increased accumulation of proliferated cells in the micro - wound .
for inner zone meniscal cells , 10 % serum increased the total number of cells in the wound as compared to the control ( figure 1b , p < 0.05 ) , increased the percentage of proliferated cells in the wound compared to all other treatments ( p < 0.005 ) , and enhanced cellular proliferation away from the wound over the control and 1 % serum treatments ( p < 0.05 ) .
additionally , 5 % serum promoted cellular proliferation in the wound over the control treatment ( p < 0.05 ) .
there was also an effect of time in the inner zone cells , with increased proliferation at both the edge and in the wound at 48 hours ( p < 0.005 ) , while the number of cells that had migrated but not proliferated in the wound decreased from 24 to 48 hours ( p < 0.05 ) .

in outer zone meniscal cells , 10 % serum increased the total number of cells in the wound ( figure 1d , p < 0.005 ) and the percentage of proliferated cells in both the wound ( p < 0.01 ) and at the edge ( p < 0.005 ) , as compared to all other treatments .
on average , treatment with 10 % serum for 48 hours resulted in a six - fold increase in the total number of cells in the wound and in the proliferated cells at both the edge and in the wound ( p < 0.01 ) .
in addition , there was an effect of time in the outer zone cells , with the total number of cells ( p < 0.005 ) and the proliferated cells in the wound being greatest at 48 hours ( p < 0.01 ) .
no differences were detected in cells that migrated but did not proliferate in the wound of outer zone cells .
the effects of il - 1 on inner and outer zone micro - wound repair il - 1 treatment of meniscal cells from the inner ( figure 2a ) or outer zones ( figure 2c ) resulted in decreased accumulation of proliferated cells in the micro - wound .
as compared to the inner zone control at 48 hours , the overall total number of cells in the wound and the proliferated cells in the wound were significantly decreased by il - 1 treatment ( figure 2b , p < 0.01 ) .
however , 0.1 ng / ml il - 1 at 48 hours showed an increase in the total cells in the wound , as compared to all other treatments at 24 hours ( p < 0.05 ) , and a corresponding increase in the number of cells that migrated but did not proliferate in the wound , as compared to all other treatments at both 24 and 48 hours ( p < 0.005 ) .
there was a significant increase in the number of migrated cells in the wound at 48 hours in the 1 ng / ml and 10 ng / ml il - 1 treatment groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
overall for inner zone cells , the control treatment caused the greatest proliferation at the edge ( p < 0.05 ) and in the wound ( p < 0.0005 ) and decreased the number of cells that migrated but did not proliferate in the wound ( p < 0.005 ) .
there was also an effect of time , with 48 hours showing increased total cells , proliferated cells and migrated cells in the wound , as compared to the 24 - hour time point ( p < 0.001 ) .

in the outer zone meniscal cells , il - 1 treatment caused a significant decrease in the number of proliferated cells in the wound , as compared to control ( figure 2d , p < 0.05 ) .
however , il - 1 did not have a significant effect on the total cell numbers in the wound , migrated cells in the wound , or the proliferated cells at the edge in the outer zone meniscal cells .
the effects of tnf - alpha on inner and outer zone micro - wound repair meniscal cells from the inner ( figure 3a ) , but not the outer zone ( figure 3c ) , showed diminished accumulation of proliferated cells in the micro - wound with increasing concentrations of tnf - alpha .
in the inner zone cells , proliferation at the edge was diminished by all concentrations of tnf - alpha ( figure 3b , p < 0.05 ) , as compared to control .
in addition , the 1 and 10 ng / ml concentrations of tnf - alpha caused significant decreases in proliferation at the edge , as compared to 0.1 ng / ml tnf - alpha ( p < 0.005 ) .
at 48 hours , proliferation in the wound was significantly higher than at 24 hours ( p < 0.05 ) .
in the inner zone cells treated with tnf - alpha , there were no differences in the total cells in the wound or migrated cells in the wound .

in the outer zone cells , there was a trend towards decreased proliferation at the edge ( figure 3d , p = 0.17 ) and in the wound ( p = 0.46 ) with tnf - alpha treatment but these changes were not significant .
tnf - alpha treatment did not alter the total number of cells in the wound or the number of cells that had migrated but not proliferated in the wound .

on the other hand , in the outer zone cells 0.1 ng / ml tgf - beta1 increased cell accumulation ( figure 4c ) .
this concentration of tgf - beta1 also significantly increased the total cell number in the wound of the outer zone cells , as compared to the control and 1 ng / ml tgf - beta1 treatment groups ( figure 4d , p < 0.05 ) .
however , tgf - beta1 treatment of outer zone cells did not alter the percentage of proliferated cells in the wound , proliferated cells at the edge , or the number of cells that had migrated into the wound but not proliferated .
the effects of il - 1 , tnf - alpha , and tgf - beta1 in the presence of serum on inner and outer zone micro - wound repair in the presence of serum , il - 1 and tnf - alpha treatment of meniscal cells from both the inner ( figure 5a ) and outer zones ( figure 5c ) resulted in decreased accumulation of proliferated cells in the micro - wound .
for inner zone cells , both il - 1 and tnf - alpha decreased total cell numbers in the wound and the percentage of proliferated cells in the wound and at the edge , as compared to 10 % serum treatment for 48 hours ( figure 5b , p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , il - 1 and tnf - alpha suppressed cell proliferation in the wound and at the edge compared to tgf - beta1 treatment for 48 hours ( p < 0.05 ) .

in the outer zone cells , tgf - beta1 treatment at 48 hours significantly increased cell proliferation in the wound compared to all other treatments ( figure 5d , p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , tgf - beta1 treatment also promoted cell proliferation at the edge ( p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , total cells ( p < 0.05 ) and proliferated cells in the wound ( p < 0.005 ) increased over time .
there was no effect on cell migration into the wound of outer zone cells with the different factors in the presence of serum .
the effects of il - 1 on cellular proliferation in meniscal repair model explants cellular proliferation at the meniscal tissue surface ( figure 6b , c ) , surface interface ( figure 7b , c ) , cross - section ( figure 8b , c ) , and cross - section interface ( figure 9b , c ) were decreased by il - 1 in both inner and outer meniscal repair explants .
in both the inner and outer zone explants , il - 1 potently inhibited cell proliferation at the tissue surface ( figure 6d , p < 0.00005 ) and the surface interface ( figure 7d , p < 0.005 ) .
in addition , il - 1 decreased cell proliferation throughout the cross - section ( figure 8d , p < 0.000005 ) and cross - section interface ( figure 9d , p < 0.0001 ) .
in the cross - section , there was a significant difference between all layers with the superficial layer having the highest percentage of proliferated cells and the deep layer having the lowest percentage ( figure 8d , p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , there was an interactive effect of il - 1 and cross - section layer ( p < 0.000005 ) .
in the cross - section interface , the deep layer had significantly less proliferation than the superficial and middle layers of the tissue ( figure 9d , p < 0.01 ) .
overall in the cross - section interface , cellular proliferation was higher in the outer zone meniscal repair model explants , as compared to the explants from the inner zone ( p < 0.05 ) .

the effects of tnf - alpha on cellular proliferation in meniscal repair model explants cellular proliferation at the meniscal tissue surface ( figure 6b , c ) , surface interface ( figure 7b , c ) , cross - section ( figure 8b , c ) , and cross - section interface ( figure 9b , c ) were decreased in the presence of tnf - alpha in both inner and outer meniscal repair explants .
tnf - alpha strongly inhibited cell proliferation at the tissue surface ( figure 6e , p < 0.00005 ) and the surface interface ( figure 7e , p < 0.005 ) in explants from both zones .
furthermore , tnf - alpha reduced cell proliferation throughout the cross - section ( figure 8e , p < 0.000005 ) and cross - section interface ( figure 9e , p < 0.000005 ) .
there was also a significant effect of cross - section layer with the superficial layer containing significantly more proliferated cells than the middle and deep layers ( figure 8e , p < 0.0005 ) .
in addition , there was an interactive effect of tnf - alpha and cross - section layer ( p < 0.00005 ) .
the effects of tgf - beta1 on cellular proliferation in meniscal repair model explants in both the inner and outer meniscal repair explants , tgf - beta1 treatment did not appear to alter cellular proliferation at the meniscal tissue surface ( figure 6b , c ) , surface interface ( figure 7b , c ) , cross - section ( figure 8b , c ) , or cross - section interface ( figure 9b , c ) .
in both inner and outer zone explants , tgf - beta1 had no effect on cellular proliferation in meniscal repair model explants at the tissue surface ( figure 6f ) , the surface interface ( figure 7f ) , or the cross - section interface ( figure 9f ) .
however , overall tgf - beta1 increased cellular proliferation in the tissue cross - section ( figure 8f , p < 0.05 ) .
while there was a significant decrease in cellular proliferation throughout the depth of the meniscus cross - section ( figure 8f , p < 0.005 ) , tgf - beta1 most noticeably up - regulated proliferation in the middle and deep layers .
the effects of il - 1 , tnf - alpha , and tgf - beta1 on the shear strength of integrative repair in the inner and outer zone meniscal explants , both il - 1 ( figure 10a , p < 0.0005 ) and tnf - alpha ( figure 10b , p < 0.005 ) significantly decreased the integrative shear strength of repair .
tgf - beta1 ( figure 10c ) had no effect on the shear strength of the meniscal repair model explants .
outer zone meniscal repair model explants demonstrated increased shear strength of repair , as compared to inner zone explants , when treated with tnf - alpha ( figure 10b , p < 0.05 ) and tgf - beta1 ( figure 10c , p < 0.005 ) .

discussion our results demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokines il - 1 and tnf - alpha decreased cell proliferation in both cell and tissue models of meniscal repair .
in the presence of serum , the anabolic growth factor tgf - beta1 increased outer zone cell proliferation in the micro - wound and in the cross section of meniscal repair model explants .
furthermore , both il - 1 and tnf - alpha decreased the integrative shear strength of repair and extracellular matrix deposition in the meniscal repair model system , while tgf - beta1 had no effect on either measure .
therefore , our results support our hypothesis that the inhibition of cell accumulation and integrative repair by il - 1 and tnf - alpha is likely due to suppression of cellular proliferation but not migration of cells into meniscal micro - wounds .
these results suggest that in vivo , meniscal cell proliferation may be diminished following joint injury due to the up - regulation of inflammatory cytokines , thereby limiting native cellular repair of meniscal lesions .
therefore , therapies that can promote meniscal cell proliferation have promise to enhance meniscal repair and improve tissue engineering strategies .
serum has been shown to promote proliferation in many cell types , including chondrocytes [ 53,54 ] .
likely growth factors present in the serum promoted healing of the micro - wound [ 55 ] .
however , inner and outer zone cells exhibited distinct responses in the micro - wound assay .
the inner zone cells showed increased cell proliferation in response to 5 % and 10 % serum , while outer zone cells were only stimulated by 10 % serum .
the inner zone cells may be more sensitive to serum stimulation due to the lack of prior exposure to the contents of the vasculature in the context of the meniscus [ 14 ] .
in addition , for inner zone cells , the percentage of cells that migrated but did not proliferate decreased over time , suggesting that the cells are migrating into the wound and then proliferating to repair the defect .
il - 1 treatment suppressed cell proliferation but increased migration in inner zone cells at the wound , although the enhanced migration was insufficient to overcome the suppression of proliferation in order to repair the micro - wound .
on the other hand , il - 1 treatment of outer zone cells decreased proliferation but did not alter cell migration into the micro - wound .
in other studies , outer and middle zone meniscal cells that grew out of bovine menisci over two to three weeks showed increased chemotaxis in response to four hours of 1 to 100 ng / ml il - 1 [ 38 ] .
in this study , we did not assess the chemotactic response of the porcine meniscal cells but the differences in our results may be due to the differences in exposure time to il - 1 .
in the presence of serum , il - 1 treatment of inner zone cells suppressed total cell accumulation and proliferation but had no effect on migration .
these experimental conditions are most similar to our explant growth conditions , and the results of these experiments are consistent .
in porcine articular chondrocytes , f - actin content is increased after 1 hour of 10 ng / ml il - 1 , showing punctate staining at the periphery but this effect is not observed after 12 hours of il - 1 treatment [ 56 ] .
in tenocytes treated with 100 pm il - 1beta for five days , proliferation rate was unchanged ; however , actin filaments were disrupted while microtubule structure was unchanged [ 57 ] .
in addition , chondrocytes treated with exogenous no , a downstream mediator of il - 1 signaling , showed inhibition of chondrocyte migration and disruption of actin filament assembly [ 54 ] .
therefore , disruption of the actin cytoskeleton may be contributing to the il - 1 mediated suppression of proliferation observed in our injury models .
the effect of tnf - alpha in suppression of proliferation was not as robust as that observed with il - 1 , consistent with our previous observations of the different potencies of equal concentrations of il - 1 and tnf - alpha on meniscal repair [ 25 ] .
in addition , tnf - alpha had no effect on the migration of meniscal cells after micro - wounding .
tnf - alpha treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) caused microtubule bundling [ 58 ] ; perhaps this reorganization prevents cellular proliferation in response to tnf - alpha .
furthermore , in the presence of serum , tnf - alpha treatment of inner zone cells suppressed total cell accumulation and proliferation but had no effect on migration , consistent with our explant experiments .
similar to our results with tgf - beta1 treatment , in other studies using isolated rabbit meniscal cells cultured in 10 % fbs and equivalent concentrations of tgf - beta1 , there was no effect of tgfbeta1on cell proliferation at 48 hours [ 59 ] .
tgf - beta1 has been shown to increase f - actin levels in isolated chondrocytes [ 60 ] and increase actin extensions and lamellar ruffling in agarose embedded chondrocytes [ 61 ] .
in other studies , 3t3 fibroblasts treated with tgf - beta1 did not migrate or proliferate and contained stabilized microtubules [ 62 ] , consistent with the overall effects observed in this study .
in the micro - wounding experiments , overall the responses of the cells at the site of the injury and away from the wound were similar for the different treatments .
these data suggest that the effect of the cytokines were stronger than any local factors that may be released in response to the wound .
however , il - 1 treatment of outer zone cells and tnf - alpha treatment of inner cells resulted in differential responses between the cells at the site of the wound and at the edge .
in these conditions , local factors produced by the wounded cells [ 63 ] may have altered the global response to the cytokine treatment [ 64 ] , resulting in different responses of the cells at the site of the injury and those away from the wound .
the cellular proliferation measured in meniscal repair model explants in this study is consistent with results from previous studies .
in particular , using fresh or frozen meniscal plugs in avascular sheep meniscal injuries treated with 50 ng / ml tgf - beta1 for eight weeks also demonstrated no difference in cell density or proliferation but cells further from the tissue surface proliferated in response to tgf - beta1 [ 65 ] .
in addition , our data are consistent with an in vivo canine model in which superficial layer cells appeared to be the most active in wound repair of meniscal tissue plugs [ 29 ] .
taken together , these results suggest that the superficial cells of the meniscus may be integral in initiating and modulating the repair response .
the decreased cellular proliferation by il - 1 and tnf - alpha correlates with the decreased integrative shear strength of repair .
in addition , these data are consistent with our previous studies that have shown that il - 1 and tnf - alpha suppressed integrative meniscal repair and decreased cell accumulation in the repair interface [ 23,25 ] .
additionally , the general lack of an effect on cell proliferation in response to tgf - beta1 treatment is consistent with the mechanical testing data .
previously , we have shown that 1 ng / ml tgf - beta1 promoted integrative repair but 10 ng / ml tgf - beta1 did not [ 24 ] .
in adult bovine meniscal repair explants , 10 ng / ml tgf - beta3 increased the shear strength of repair at eight weeks but not four weeks [ 44 ] , suggesting that longer times in culture may be necessary to see the beneficial effects of tgf - beta1 on meniscal repair .
scaffolds containing tgf - beta3 increased chemotaxis of cells and articular cartilage regeneration in a rabbit model , as compared to scaffolds without tgf - beta3 [ 66 ] , suggesting differential responses of cells to the different isoforms of tgf - beta .
interestingly , the outer zone explants showed increased shear strength of repair in the tnf - alpha and tgf - beta1 treatment groups , as compared to inner zone explants .
this result is similar to the two - week time point in a previous study , but these differences disappeared over extended culture periods [ 15 ] .
cell viability was not altered by any of the treatments in this study , suggesting that the decreased repair in the presence of il - 1 and tnf - alpha was not due to induction of cell death by these cytokines .
the inner zone control samples stained more strongly for proteoglycans than the outer zone samples , reflecting the intrinsic composition of the meniscal tissue [ 14 ] .
histological staining revealed the presence of a predominantly collagen - rich matrix bridging the interface in control and tgf - beta1 treated samples , whereas reparative tissue was largely absent in il - 1 and tnf - alpha treated explants .
new protein synthesis , in particular collagen deposition [ 67 ] and cross - linking [ 68,69 ] , are required for successful integrative repair in cartilage repair model systems .
while isolated inner and outer zone cells demonstrated different responses to the various treatments , cells of the inner and outer zone meniscal repair model explants exhibited similar responses .
recently , isolated outer zone cells have also been shown to migrate faster and have lower adhesion strength than inner zone cells in response to electric fields [ 70 ] .
these data suggest that the sub - populations of cells in the meniscus are inherently different but these differences may be masked by the extracellular matrix in explant culture .
isolated cells lack natural cellular morphology and contact with native extracellular matrix components , whereas explants maintain the cells in the context of the extracellular matrix and associated signaling molecules .
important differences have been noted in the ability of cells to move through two - dimensional and three - dimensional culture systems , particularly due to the barriers presented by collagen networks [ 71 ] .
in a recent study , fetal , juvenile and adult bovine meniscal cells showed similar proliferation rates and migration abilities in a monolayer micro - wound model .
however , fetal and juvenile meniscal repair model explants showed improved repair strength over time while adult explants did not improve [ 44 ] , further showing the capacity of these two model systems to reveal different information .
these model systems provide valuable information on the cellular response of the meniscus to inflammatory cytokines and growth factors , allowing a careful study of proliferation , migration and matrix deposition under well - controlled environmental conditions .
these studies will help to inform future in vivo studies on mechanisms to promote meniscal repair .
however , the direct translatability of these studies to in vivo applications is limited by the fact that the joint environment is more complicated , including the presence of many different cell and tissue types and a variety of inflammatory factors that are produced in the joint following meniscal injury .
in addition , altered metabolism in all joint tissues and altered mechanical loading effects must be considered for successful in vivo studies .
there are few in vivo meniscal repair studies that have assessed cell migration and proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition .
several animal models of avascular meniscal tears have shown that either autologous or allogenic chondrocytes in a scaffold are necessary for the formation of reparative matrix tissue in the lesion and integration of cells into the native meniscus [ 72 - 74 ] .
animals treated with scaffolds alone resulted in increased cellularity of fibroblast - like cells at the edges of the lesion but no repair tissue in the interface [ 74 ] .
adipose - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( ascs ) placed in rabbit avascular meniscal lesions prior to suturing , increased the healing rate and yielded an increase in the cellularity of meniscal fibrochondrocytes in the repair tissue [ 75 ] .
alternatively , several in vivo studies have demonstrated the need for a vascular supply to promote healing of meniscal lesions , inducing proliferation of vessels , endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells , and resulting in fibrovascular scar tissue repair [ 13,76 ] .
however , proliferation of endothelial cells by vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) coated sutures was not sufficient to promote healing of meniscal lesions in the avascular region of sheep menisci [ 77 ] .
the importance of meniscal cell migration and proliferation in meniscal healing is evidenced by a study showing that donor cells from fresh meniscal allografts in the goat do not survive but the host cells migrate into the allograft and repopulate the transplant [ 78 ] .
in addition , in canine menisci containing devitalized meniscal plugs , cells migrate across the bridging tissue and into the interface , ultimately migrating into the devitalized plugs , remodeling the matrix , and filling the interface with a hyaline - fibrocartilage matrix [ 29 ] .
cell migration and / or proliferation are necessary for endogenous meniscal healing and repair .
in order to repair a meniscal tear , cells must repopulate the wound and synthesize new extracellular matrix to achieve integrative repair .
however , if cells are not able to fill in the gap , as in the presence of inflammatory cytokines , synthesis of reparative tissue and integrative repair cannot occur .
additionally , il - 1 treatment up - regulates mmp activity that promotes the catabolism of the meniscal extracellular matrix [ 24,26,27,34 ] .
therefore , a variety of strategies , including blocking proinflammatory cytokines [ 25 ] , inhibiting mmp activity [ 26,79 ] , and / or using anabolic growth factors [ 24 ] to increase matrix synthesis and promote cellular proliferation , may be required to promote meniscal healing following an injury and to increase the success of tissue engineering constructs .
conclusions in conclusion , we have shown that the inflammatory cytokines il - 1 and tnf - alpha suppress the proliferation of meniscal cells and suppress integrative meniscal repair , while tgf - beta1 overall does not alter the proliferation of cells or meniscal repair .
in inner zone meniscal cells , migration is increased by il - 1 treatment but not enough to overcome the suppression of proliferation and fill the micro - wound .
however , all other factors did not alter cellular migration independent of proliferation .
therefore , the suppression of cellular proliferation by il - 1 and tnf - alpha may prevent integrative repair of meniscal lesions by decreasing cell accumulation in the wound , and consequently diminishing the available cell population that can mediate the synthesis of reparative tissue .
therefore , strategies that promote the proliferation of meniscal cells may be able to enhance integrative repair following injury and promote the success of tissue engineered constructs .

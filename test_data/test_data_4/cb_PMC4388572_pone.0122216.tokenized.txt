moreover , the effectiveness of adjuvant chemo - and / or radiotherapy remains controversial .
objectives to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mcs of bone and soft tissue , to assess the efficacies of surgery , chemotherapy and radiation , and finally to deliver a more appropriate therapy .
materials and methods we reviewed embase - , medline - , cochrane - , ovid - and pubmed - based to find out all cases of mcs of bone and soft tissue described between april 1994 and april 2014 .
description of treatment and regular follow - up was required for each study .
language was restricted to english and chinese .
issues of age , gender , location , metastasis , and treatment were all evaluated for each case .
kaplan - meier method and cox proportional hazard regression model were used in the survival analysis .
results from the 630 identified publications , 18 meeting the inclusion criteria were selected , involving a total of 107 patients .
based on these data , the 5 - , 10 - and 20 - year overall survival are 55.0 % , 43.5 % and 15.7 % respectively .
the 5 - , 10 - , 20 - year event - free survival rates are 45.0 % , 27.2 % and 8.1 % , respectively .
treatment without surgery is associated with poorer overall survival and event - free survival .
negative surgical margins could significantly bring down the local - recurrence rate and are associated with a higher event - free survival rate .
chemotherapy regime based on anthracyclines does not benefit the overall survival .
the addition of radiation therapy is not significantly associated with the overall or event - free survival .
however , we recommend radiation as the salvage therapy for patients with positive margin so as to achieve better local control .
conclusions this review shows that surgery is essential in the management of mcs of bone and soft tissue .
appropriate adjuvant therapy may reduce local recurrence , but cannot benefit the overall survival .

introduction mesenchymal chondrosarcoma ( mcs ) is a rare high - grade of variant of chondrosarcoma first described in 1959 [ 1 ] .
it only accounts for 1 % to 10 % of all chondrosarcomas [ 2 - 4 ] .
histologically , mcs has a typical biphasic pattern consisting of both small cells and islands of atypical cartilage. [ 4 ] mcs differs from typical chondrosarcomas in the following respects .
first , mcs has a slight female preponderance and occurs in the nervous system in patients at age 20 to 30 and in soft tissues in patients at age 40 or older , whereas classical chondrosarcomas show a predilection for middle - aged to elderly males. [ 5 ] second , mcs tends to be more aggressive , with 5 - and 10 - year survival rates of 54.6 % and 27.3 % , respectively. [ 6 ] although these tumors originate in the bone in most cases , strikingly 22 % to 50 % of them originate in the soft tissues [ 7 , 8 ] , especially the brain and the meninges [ 9 ] .
mcs has a high propensity to metastasize to the lungs , lymph nodes , and other bones [ 6 , 8 ] .
for tumors originating from other sites such as the kidney , mandible , orbit , and central nervous system ( cns ) , the treatment and prognosis are different from tumor originating from bone or soft tissue location .
for example , intracranial mcs induces a mortality rate of 54 % according to a systematic review involving 60 patients published in 2009 [ 9 ] .
there are less than 500 cases of mcs published , while most of them were reported in case repots or case series .
except one study published in 2014 [ 10 ] , all 3 other series encompassing more than 20 individuals each were published more than 20 years ago [ 6 , 7 , 11 ] .
owing to its rarity , mcs remains poorly understood .
resection with wide margins is usually recommended , but is frequently unfeasible because of anatomic constraints , especially for tumors in the axial regions .
mcs is believed to be more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation compared with other types of chondrosarcomas .
the systematic therapy for mcs may follow ewing sarcoma as recommended in national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) and european society for medical oncology ( esmo ) guidelines .
however , most reports on mcs are case reports or retrospective case series. is mcs really sensitive to adjuvant therapy ?
we tried but failed to find strong evidence .
therefore , the effectiveness of adjuvant chemo - and / or radiotherapy ( act / art ) remains controversial [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 10 - 13 ] .
the objectives of this systematic review are to describe the prognosis of mcs in bone and soft tissue , to assess the efficacies of surgery , chemotherapy and radiation , and finally to deliver a more appropriate therapy .
methods search strategy a search was performed in embase , medline , ovid , pubmed and cochrane library ( cochrane database of systematic reviews , database of abstracts of reviews of effects , and cochrane central register of controlled trials ) to identify studies ( including case reports and case series published between 1994 and 2014 ) evaluating the treatment of mcs in bone and soft tissue .
the databases were searched using a combination of the following items : " mesenchymal " and " chondrosarcoma " .
eligibility criteria we included all cohort studies about mcs , including randomized controlled trials , case series and case reports .
each study had to report original data on age , gender , location , metastasis , treatment with surgery / chemotherapy / radiation , and follow - up period .
the inclusion criteria are : ( i ) case series design with more than one case reported , ( ii ) follow - up data available for all patients ( at least 3 months ) ; ( iii ) information for the data from each patient to be completely disaggregated .
the exclusion criteria are : ( i ) all mcs originating from sites other than bone and soft tissues were excluded ; ( ii ) patients dead within3 months after diagnosis or without any treatment .
study selection to identify potentially relevant studies , two authors ( xj and lds ) independently evaluated the titles and then the abstracts on the basis of the eligibility criteria .
full - text articles published in english or chinese were screened to test the eligibility .
the reference lists of these articles were also searched to find out additional articles .
among patients with mcs arising in bones or soft tissues , only those with adequate histologic proof of the disease and satisfactory data concerning treatment and follow - up were included in this analysis .
disagreement was solved through discussion .
data extraction one author extracted the data using a standardized form , while the second author checked the extracted data .
the following data were collected : demographic and clinical characteristics , location , therapy , outcomes after consecutive therapy , and the duration of follow - up. if more than one published report of the same group of patients , the articles were analyzed to verify whether or not they reported different outcomes .
if they presented the same outcomes we extracted the data from the most recent or most complete article .
when important data were missing in some studies , the first author ( xj ) tried to contact the authors to obtain the additional information .
if it was impossible to obtain from the authors , these data were considered missing .
assessment of quality the methodological quality of these studies was assessed by two authors ( xj and lds ) independently , using grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations ( grade ) published in 2004 [ 14 ] disagreement was solved through discussion .
survival analysis from these selected studies , only patients with tumors in bone and soft tissue were included in the following analysis .
statistics were calculated on spss 17.0 ( chicago , ill ) .
the survival analysis was conducted using the kaplan - meier method and cox proportional hazards regression .
overall survival ( os ) , event - free survival ( efs ) and recurrence - free survival ( rfs ) rates were calculated using the kaplan - meier estimator .
os was estimated during the time from diagnosis to death , or from therapy , to last follow - up. efs was estimated during the time from diagnosis to first recurrence or progression ( any evidence of growth of a tumor that was not in clinical cr ) or last follow - up. if no event occurred , the survival data were censored at last follow - up .
[ 12 ] clinicopathological variables described above in data extraction were analyzed with the cox regression model .
results study selection with these key words , the literature search yielded 630 potentially eligible studies .
after initial screening , 63 studies ( including case reports , retrospective and prospective studies ) were manually sorted to extract all descriptions of patients .
among these articles , two were written in other language ; important information was unavailable in 5 articles ; special locations were found such as cns in other 38 articles. ( table 1 ) .
finally , 18 articles ( table 2 ) involving 107 patients with mcs in bone and soft tissue were included in the systematic review ( fig 1 ) , including 11 isolated case reports [ 15 - 25 ] ( 1 / 12 involving two cases [ 26 ]) , 6 retrospective case studies involving 88 patients [ 2 - 4 , 10 , 13 , 27 ] and 1 prospective study involving 6 patients [ 12 ] .
the description of all articles is displayed in table 2 .
among the 18 papers , 16 were published in english ( n = 104 ) , and two were in both english and chinese ( n = 3 ) .
owing to the different biological behaviors and treatments , tumors at special locations were excluded , including skull , cns , kidney , infant , eye , orbit , lung , spleen , breast , heart , thyroid , sinonasal tract , jaws , gastrointestinal tract , mediastinum , uterus and vulva .

studies and patients characteristics totally 107 patients with mcs in bone and soft tissue were finally included in this review .
their demographic and clinical characteristics are described in table 3 .
there are 56 % males and 44 % females , with more than three quarters under 40 years old .
the ratio of locations between bone and soft tissue is 3:2 , which is the same to extremities and trunk .
primary tumor sites were thigh ( n = 32 ) , calf ( n = 14 ) , upper arm ( n = 14 ) , forearm ( n = 3 ) , spine or paraspine ( n = 13 ) , pelvis ( n = 17 ) , rib or chest wall ( n = 13 ) , and toes ( n = 1 ) .
the treatments , including surgery ( n = 99 ; 92.7 %) , chemotherapy ( 64 ; 63.4 %) , and radiation ( 28 ; 27.7 %) .
about 43 ( 39.8 %) patients were treated with both surgery and chemotherapy , 7 ( 6.5 %) patients with both surgery and radiation , and 16 ( 14.8 %) patients with all three therapies .

the 5 - , 10 - , 15 , - and 20 - year efs rates are 45.0 % , 27.2 % , 16.2 % and 8.1 % , respectively .
the 5 - , 10 - , 15 - , and 20 year os rates are 55.0 % , 43.5 % , 35.4 % and 15.7 % , respectively .
unlike other types of sarcomas such as osteosarcoma and ewing sarcoma , patients with mcs are not significantly different in os whether they suffer from local disease or metastatic disease upon diagnosis ( p = 0.095 )( fig 2 ) .
it seems that in the first 2 years , the os rate is higher in local disease than in metastatic patients .
however , when patients successfully survived more than 3 years after diagnosis , the os rates of the two groups converged .
this result may be expressed by its high metastatic rate .
subgroup analysis was performed involving 76 patients with localized disease .
among these patients , the 5 and 10 - year efs rates are 49.1 % and 31.2 % , respectively ( median efs period 57.5 months ) , and the 5 and 10 - year os rates are 54.8 % and 38.3 % , respectively ( median os period 80.0 months ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0122216.g002 fig 2 comparison of overall survival rate in local disease and metastatic disease .
univariant analysis shows that tumors in the axial region are associated with a worse prognosis ( p = 0.027 )( fig 3 ) .
the 5 and 10 - year os rates for the axial region are 41.0 % and 22.8 % , respectively , but are 55.3 % and 44.2 % , respectively , for non - axial regions .
this difference may be explained by the difficulty in reaching wide surgical margins in the axial region .
patients at age below 30 years tend to have a decreased os rates ( fig 4 ) , but not significantly ( p = 0.173 ) .
treatment with surgery is significantly associated with improved os ( p = 0.000 )( fig 5 ) and efs ( p = 0.000 ) .
in contrast , the treatment of chemotherapy would benefit efs ( p = 0.046 ) not os ( p = 0.139 )( fig 6 ) .
none of gender , origin and site of the tumor ( trunk vs. extremities ; bone vs. soft tissue ) , or radiation is significantly associated with os or efs .
patients treated with radiation tend to show a lower recurrence rate , but not significantly ( p = 0.199 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0122216.g003 fig 3 compared with non - axial region , tumor in axial region has a much lower overall survival rate ( p = 0.027 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0122216.g004 fig 4 prognostic significance of age of the patients is shown .
it is comparison of patients elder than 30 and those younger than 30 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0122216.g005 fig 5 this figure shows the comparison of overall survival for patients treated with surgery and those without .
a statistically significant difference was noted between the groups by the cox regression test ( p = 0.000 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0122216.g006 fig 6 this figure shows the comparison of overall survival for patients treated with chemotherapy and those without .
there was a trend for patients to get a better overall survival with chemotherapy , however with no statistically significany .
surgical margins are important in the management .
only 82 of the 107 patients were able to provide information of surgical margins .
moreover , 67 patients received wide or radical resection and got a negative margin , while 15 patients underwent intralesional surgery and got a positive margin .
negative margins are significantly associated with improved local - rfs ( p = 0.000 )( fig 7a ) and efs ( p = 0.050 ) .
for 15 patients with positive margins , 1 of them was lost to follow - up. for the 14 patients , 5 of them received postoperative radiation as the salvage therapy , and only 2 / 5 of them experienced local recurrence .
for the other 9 patients without receiving radiation therapy , the local recurrence rate is up to 90 % ( 8 / 9 ) .
the cox regression demonstrates that postoperative radiation can significantly bring down the local recurrence rate for patients with positive margins ( p = 0.013 )( fig 7b ) .
however , postoperative radiation does n't benefit the os and efs rates in this group .
about 10 / 14 patients received chemotherapy after surgery , but it did not benefit the survival ( p = 0.436 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0122216.g007 fig 7 local - recurrence - free survival of these 82 patients was estimated using the kaplan - meier plots .
( a ) a statistically significant difference was noted between the positive margins and negative margins by cox regression ( p = 0.000 ) .
( b ) for positive margins , postoperative radiation therapy could remarkably bring down local recurrence rate ( p = 0.013 ) .
discussion mcs is a rare high - grade variant of chondrosarcoma .
because of its rarity , most studies about mcs only involve a small sample size , and there are few clinical trials involving more than 10 patients in the past 20 years [ 10 , 12 ] .
tumors originating from special sites , such as cns , are usually associated with special prognosis and treatment .
this systematic review summarizes the available evidences on mcs in bone and soft tissue in the last 2 decades , and represents the survival condition and assesses the efficacies of surgery , chemotherapy and radiation. of the 630 potentially eligible articles , only 19 studies , with low to high quality meet the inclusion criteria .
the pooled results ( from 19 studies ) show that the 5 and 10 - year os rates were 55.0 % and 43.5 % , respectively .
the os rates has slightly improved compared with studies of mcs ( n > 10 ) published 20 years ago [ 6 , 7 , 11 , 28 , 29 ] ( table 4 ) .

it is still open to discussion whether the specific anatomic sites result in milder histological behavior , smaller size at diagnosis , different therapy and finally a better outcome [ 8 , 9 , 30 , 31 ] .
our systematic review focuses on the classical sites of bone and soft tissue , and excludes those arising from special anatomic locations , thus guaranteeing the heterogeneity of this study and the following survival analysis .
on the result from long - term follow - up suggests that the careful monitoring after diagnosis should last more than 10 years , because mcs has a strong tendency toward late local and metastatic recurrence .
estimation of conditional survival ( cs ) for cancer patients diagnosed at different ages and disease stages provides patients and clinicians with important information in planning of follow - up , surveillance and management .
for most of cancers , patients usually have a much higher chance to survive another 5 years once they have successfully survived 5 - years or more on their cancer journey [ 32 ] .
the 5 - year cs can be estimated using paul dickman 's method [ 33 ] for period analysis .
the 5 - year cs rate for osteosarcoma and ewing sarcoma [ 34 ] can reach up to 91.4 % if the patients have already survived 10 years .
however , our analysis shows that mcs patients still suffer from a poor 5 - year survival rate of less than 50 % even after a survival of 10 or even 15 years .
it reminds us that continuous monitoring is needed even 15 years after diagnosis .
wide local excision to achieve a wide surgical margin is commonly regarded as the " gold standard " in treatment of mcs .
but little positive evidence has been obtained to demonstrate the effect of margin perhaps owing to the rarity of mcs [ 10 , 12 ] .
the importance of adequate surgery has been confirmed in a study involving 26 patients in a single institute in italy , since all the 5 patients with positive margins died in the follow up , which suggests that margins should be the first goal [ 3 ] .
to our best knowledge , no previous study shows a significantly association between surgical margins and the final survival rate , including rfs and efs .
our finding demonstrates the importance of clear margin in treatment of mcs for the first time .
in the terms of radiation , it seems to only benefit patients with positive margins .
a retrospectively review involving the cases of msc diagnosed between 1979 and 2010 at md anderson cancer shows that the addition of art for mcs would benefit local control of mcs ( no radiated patients experienced local recurrence during the follow - up period , while nearly 70 % of the in - radiated patients suffered from [ 10 ] .
however , this excellent local control failed to show the advantage in efs or os , which meant that patients escaping from local recurrence had the same risk of metastasis or death because of this malignancy .
this result coincided with our study .
although patients with positive margins may escape from local recurrence within half a year without postoperative radiation [ 19 ] , we still recommend that for patients who are unable to get radical resection , irradiation is an effective remedial measure to reduce the recurrence rate .
highly variable regimes are used as act of mcs , including dactinomycin ( amd ) , carboplatin ( car ) , cisplatin ( ddp ) , cyclophosphamide ( cyc ) , doxorubicin ( dox ) , etoposide ( eto ) , ifosfamide ( ifo ) , high - dose methotrexate ( mtx ) , and vincristine ( vcr ) .
in most cases , they are used in different combinations or following ewing 's sarcoma regimes , and dox seems to be essential in all types of regimes [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 11 - 13 , 21 , 28 , 29 ] .
patients with mcs can be divided by the histologic categories into two groups to select a treatment protocol [ 7 ] .
those exhibiting a small cell pattern received an act regime consulting ewing family of tumors ( focusing on dox and ctx ) , while the hemangiopericytomatoid pattern received a reported regime in treatment of osteosarcoma .
using this histological specific regime ( also the unique one ) , the os rate was 42 % at 5 years and 28 % at 10 years .
however , some doctors are skeptic to this histologic specific regime , since the overlap of histologic patterns commonly appears in some specimens [ 6 ] .
high p - smad2 and pai - 1 expressions have been found in mcs specimens , which points to the importance of tgfb signaling as a promising therapeutic option .
targets on the bcl - 2 family members may also be effective [ 35 ] .
in summary , there is no general agreement on the regime of chemotherapy as the adjuvant therapy of mcs , except for dox as a cornerstone .
however , it must be stressed that the majority of patients relapse with distant metastases , which indicates the importance of using an effective systemic control group .
the ambiguous response to chemotherapy or radiation may relate to the specific histology of mcs .
mcs contains a typical biphasic pattern of undifferentiated small round cells , which resemble the ewing family of tumors and are blamed to be the highly malignant part , blended with islands of well - differentiated hyaline cartilage [ 36 ] .
for an individual patient with mcs , the crucial factors probably affecting his / her outcome include the proportion of spindle - cell or round - cell elements and cartilage , the pattern of distribution , and the transition between these two parts .
on the other hand , mcs can be separated by histologic examination into two subgroups : those with a predominant hemangiopericytomatoid growth component , and those with a small cell undifferentiated cellular pattern [ 7 ] .
the latter is usually more sensitive to drugs and radioactive rays , but presents a higher malignant behavior and a worse outcome. from this perspective , mcs of this pattern may benefit more from chemotherapy .
because of the rarity of mcs , most of the studies in our review are case reports or small - size case series .
it is difficult to get uniform criteria in the surgical margin , the regime in chemotherapy and radiation among different studies .
it remains to be determined whether lack of a significant impact of chemotherapy over the survival rates is the result of limited efficacy of the chemotherapy or the selection bias of the patients .
implications for clinical practice and research our study demonstrates that mcs has a strong trend toward late local and metastatic recurrence .
a long - term surveillance of more than 20 years is necessary in the management .
surgery is significantly associated with improved os and efs rates .
radical surgery with negative surgical margin , if possible , seems to be the mainstay therapy for mcs .
in contrast , the treatment with chemotherapy does not benefit os. radiation itself fails to show significant association with either os or efs .
this result reminds us that not every mcs patient will benefit from aggressive therapy .
we recommend that for lesions not amenable to ablative surgical treatment , irradiation is an effective remedial measure to bring down the recurrence rate .
for patient with more malignant mcs in pathological behavior , the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy may play a more important role .
more effective regimes and new targeted therapy are needed in the future .
the differentiation of the ewing - like pattern from the hemangiopericytoma - like pattern in the spectrum of mcs may attract more interest from a therapeutic standpoint .

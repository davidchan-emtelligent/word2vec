the organohalide - respiring epsilonproteobacterium sulfurospirillum multivorans is able to grow with hydrogen as electron donor and with tetrachloroethene ( pce ) as electron acceptor ; pce is reductively dechlorinated to cis - 1,2 - dichloroethene .
recently , a genomic survey revealed the presence of four gene clusters encoding nife hydrogenases in its genome , one of which is presumably periplasmic and membrane - bound ( mbh ) , whereas the remaining three are cytoplasmic .
to explore the role and regulation of the four hydrogenases , quantitative real - time pcr and biochemical studies were performed with s. multivorans cells grown under different growth conditions .
the large subunit genes of the mbh and of a cytoplasmic group 4 hydrogenase , which is assumed to be membrane - associated , show high transcript levels under nearly all growth conditions tested , pointing toward a constitutive expression in s. multivorans .
the gene transcripts encoding the large subunits of the other two hydrogenases were either not detected at all or only present at very low amounts .
the presence of mbh under all growth conditions tested , even with oxygen as electron acceptor under microoxic conditions , indicates that mbh gene transcription is not regulated in contrast to other facultative hydrogen - oxidizing bacteria .
the mbh showed quinone - reactivity and a characteristic uv / vis spectrum implying a cytochrome b as membrane - integral subunit .
cell extracts of s. multivorans were subjected to native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( page ) and hydrogen oxidizing activity was tested by native staining .
only one band was detected at about 270 kda in the particulate fraction of the extracts , indicating that there is only one hydrogen - oxidizing enzyme present in s. multivorans .
an enrichment of this enzyme and sds page revealed a subunit composition corresponding to that of the mbh. from these findings we conclude that the mbh is the electron - donating enzyme system in the pce respiratory chain .
the roles for the other three hydrogenases remain unproven .
the group 4 hydrogenase might be involved in hydrogen production upon fermentative growth .
organohalide respiration hydrogenase real - time pcr regulation of gene expression hydrogen anaerobic respiration deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft10.13039 / 501100001659for 1530gsc 214 introduction molecular hydrogen ( h2 ) is one of the primary electron donors for many anaerobic respiratory processes mediated by prokaryotes .
organohalide respiration , in which energy conservation is coupled to the reductive dehalogenation of halogenated organic compounds , is no exception in this regard .
obligate organohalide - respiring bacteria such as dehalococcoides mccartyi and dehalobacter restrictus rely solely on h2 as electron donor ( holliger et al. , 1998 ; loffler et al. , 2013 ) , while most versatile organohalide - respiring organisms , e.g. , desulfitobacterium spp. or sulfurospirillum spp. , use h2 as one of many electron donors ( scholz - muramatsu et al. , 1995 ; luijten et al. , 2003 ; villemur et al. , 2006 ; goris and diekert , 2016 ) .
one feature , which is common to many genomes of organohalide - respiring bacteria , is the presence of multiple hydrogenase - encoding gene clusters ( kube et al. , 2005 ; seshadri et al. , 2005 ; nonaka et al. , 2006 ; kruse et al. , 2013 , 2015 ; goris et al. , 2014 ) .
besides h2 oxidation in respiratory processes , which is usually mediated by a membrane - bound nife hydrogenase , several different cellular metabolic processes are thought to recruit the other hydrogenase enzymes for either h2 oxidation or h + reduction .
the roles of these hydrogenases are unknown and under debate ( seshadri et al. , 2005 ; rupakula et al. , 2013 ; goris et al. , 2014 ; mansfeldt et al. , 2014 ; kruse et al. , 2015 ) .
for example , cytoplasmic hydrogenases with an nad ( p )+ binding motif might be responsible for generating reducing equivalents for biosynthetic pathways or for balancing the cellular redox state .
group 4 ech - type hydrogenases , which often harbor several large membrane - integral subunits , might also be involved in energy - conserving processes , as reported for methanogens ( hedderich and forzi , 2005 ; welte et al. , 2010 ) .
sulfurospirillum multivorans is a versatile organohalide - respiring epsilonproteobacterium that uses h2 or other compounds such as formate or pyruvate as electron donors and chlorinated ethenes or , e.g. , nitrate or fumarate as electron acceptor ( scholz - muramatsu et al. , 1995 ; goris and diekert , 2016 ) .
recently , it has also been shown that the organism is able to utilize o2 as terminal electron acceptor under microoxic conditions with about 5 % o2 in the gas phase ( goris et al. , 2014 ) .
the genome of s. multivorans contains gene clusters encoding four different nife hydrogenases .
one is predicted to be a periplasmic , membrane - bound h2 - oxidizing enzyme ( membrane - bound hydrogenase , mbh , hydabc encoded by smul _ 1423 - 1425 ) , which is very similar ( 50 to 76 % subunit amino acid sequence identity ) to the characterized uptake hydrogenase of wolinella succinogenes ( dross et al. , 1992 ) .
the small subunit of the mbh of both organisms , hyda , contains a tat signal peptide which is cleaved off after maturation and transport of the mbh into the periplasm .
hydc is a membrane - integral cytochrome b subunit which connects the hydrogenase to the quinone pool ( gross et al. , 2004 ) .
the other three hydrogenases contain no signal peptide motif and are therefore considered to be cytoplasmic ( goris et al. , 2014 ) .
one of these three enzymes ( hupsl , encoded by smul _ 1421 - 1422 ) is related to cytoplasmic h2 - consuming hydrogenases and regulatory hydrogenases , the other two can be classified as group 4 hydrogenases , which are known to produce h2 ( vignais and billoud , 2007 ) .
the hydrogenase encoded by the ech gene cluster ( structural proteins echedfc encoded by smul _ 1307 - 1310 ) bears similarities to the co - induced hydrogenase of carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans ( soboh et al. , 2002 ) , but the s. multivorans genome does not contain genes coding for a co dehydrogenase .
hydrogenase membrane subunit genes were not found on the ech gene cluster , which is remarkable , since all group 4 hydrogenase gene clusters normally contain genes encoding membrane - integral subunits ( greening et al. , 2016 ) .
the fourth hydrogenase comprises eight subunits ( hyfabcefghi encoded by smul _ 2383 - 2390 ) , of which four are predicted to be membrane - integral .
this hydrogenase is similar to hydrogenase 4 ( hyf ) of escherichia coli .
this enzyme found in several enterobacteriaceae might interact with a cytoplasmic formate dehydrogenase ( fdhf ) to form a formate hydrogen lyase ( fhl ) complex ( trchounian et al. , 2012 ; sargent , 2016 ) .
at least two of the hydrogenases of s. multivorans , the mbh and the hyf , are produced during tetrachloroethene ( pce ) respiration with either pyruvate or formate as sole electron donor ( goris et al. , 2015 ) .
the periplasmically oriented mbh is assumed to be the main h2 - oxidizing enzyme in s. multivorans , since h2 - oxidizing activity was detected in whole cells and the majority of this activity was found to be membrane - associated ( miller et al. , 1996 ) .
however , these assays were performed with cells and extracts from s. multivorans grown with h2 / fumarate , while a study with h2 / pce - grown cells was never carried out .
deduced from amino acid sequence similarity , hupsl was discussed to play a role in either the recycling of h2 produced cytoplasmically ( e.g. , during n2 fixation ) or to deliver low - potential reducing equivalents for anabolic purposes comparable to aquifex aeolicus hydrogenase iii ( guiral et al. , 2005 ) .
however , it could also be involved in h2 - dependent pce respiration .
the two group 4 hydrogenases might play a role in h2 production from excess reducing equivalents during fermentative growth .
the putative roles of the four hydrogenases in s. multivorans are depicted in figure 1 .
figure 1 putative physiological roles of the four hydrogenases of sulfurospirillum multivorans and their subcellular localization .
mbh , membrane - bound hydrogenase hydabc ; hup , cytoplasmic uptake hydrogenase hupsl ; hyf , hyfabcefghi similar to e. coli hydrogenase 4 ; ech , echedfc , similar to the co - induced hydrogenase of carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans , but in s. multivorans lacking any membrane subunit .
usually hydrogenase expression underlies specific regulation depending on their physiological role and growth conditions ( kovacs et al. , 2005 ; greening and cook , 2014 ) .
for example , uptake hydrogenases gene transcription is upregulated when h2 is available , nife hydrogenase gene expression is down - regulated when the cofactor nickel is absent , and o2 - sensitive hydrogenases are not expressed under oxic conditions .
however , in both epsilonproteobacteria and organohalide - respiring bacteria nearly nothing is known about hydrogenase gene regulation .
in this study we wanted to ( 1 ) reveal the hydrogen uptake metabolism of s. multivorans during h2 - driven pce respiration and characterize the uptake hydrogenase involved in this process and ( 2 ) investigate the transcript profiles of hydrogenase catalytic subunit genes during different growth conditions , which might give information about the regulation of the four hydrogenases and their physiological role in s. multivorans .
experimental procedures cultivation of s. multivorans sulfurospirillum multivorans ( dsmz 12446 ) was grown anaerobically at 28degreesc in rubber stoppered glass bottles shaken at 150 rpm with an aqueous to gas phase ratio of 1:1 .
the medium was described previously containing cysteine as reductant but did not contain vitamin b12 ( cyanocobalamin ) here ( scholz - muramatsu et al. , 1995 ) .
before autoclaving , the gas phase contained 150 kpa n2 .
pyruvate ( 40 mm ) was used as electron donor and fumarate ( 40 mm ) , pce , nitrate ( 10 mm ) , or 5 % o2 as electron acceptor .
in the latter case , o2 concentration in the gas phase was measured with the microx 4 oxygen meter ( presens precision sensing gmbh , regensburg , germany ) .
the amount of 5 % o2 in the gas phase corresponded to approximately 0.5 mg / l medium in the liquid phase .
cells growing with pyruvate as electron donor were cultivated at least 50 transfers without h2 in the gas phase to test for possible long - term regulation effects .
pce was added to the medium in a nominal concentration of 10 mm from a 0.5 m pce hexadecane stock solution .
when cells were cultivated with h2 as electron donor , a gas phase of h2 ( 150 kpa ) was applied and acetate ( 5 mm ) was added as carbon source .
for experiments with n2 as sole nitrogen source , ammonium chloride was omitted from the basal medium and n2 ( 150 kpa ) was used as gas phase .
the following energy substrate combinations were used : pyruvate / fumarate , pyruvate / pce , pyruvate / o2 , pyruvate alone , h2 / pce , and h2 / nitrate .
growth was monitored photometrically at 578 nm. cell harvesting and samples preparation sulfurospirillum multivorans cells were harvested oxically in the mid - exponential growth phase by centrifugation ( 12,000 x g , 10 min at 10degreesc ) .
resulting cell pellets were washed twice in 50 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) and resuspended in two volumes ( 2 ml per g cells ) of the same buffer with additional dnase i ( applichem , darmstadt , germany ) and protease inhibitor ( one tablet for 10 ml buffer ; complete mini , edta - free ; roche , mannheim , germany ) .
cell disruption was carried out semi - anoxically using a french press cell ( 1500 psi ) , which was made anoxic in a glovebox ( coy laboratory products inc. , grass lake , mi , usa ) , while the disruption itself was performed outside the tent .
the obtained crude extracts were used for biochemical experiments .
cells were fractionated by ultracentrifugation ( 36,000 x g , 45 min at 4degreesc ) , supernatants were designated soluble fractions ( sf ) .
the pellets were resuspended in two volumes ( 2 ml per g membrane pellet ) 50 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) ; a part of this suspension was used further as membrane fraction ( mf ) , while the rest was mixed with 0.1 % triton x - 100 and stirred at 4degreesc overnight .
solubilized membrane extract ( me ) was obtained from the resulting supernatant after ultracentrifugation ( 36,000 x g , 45 min at 4degreesc ) .
enrichment of the membrane - bound hydrogenase enrichment was carried out at room temperature in an anoxic chamber with an atmosphere of 98 % n2 and 2 % h2 ( coy laboratory products inc. , grass lake , mi , usa ) using an akta - fplc system ( ge healthcare europe gmbh , freiburg , germany ) .
cells were grown in 2 l schott bottles ( aqueous to gas phase ratio 1:1 ) with pyruvate and fumarate .
harvesting , disruption and fractionation was done as described in the previous chapter , except that 1 % digitonin was used as detergent .
the filtered solubilized me was fractionated via an anion exchange column ( q - sepharose hp column 10 / 10 , ge healthcare europe gmbh , freiburg , germany ) .
the q - sepharose column was pre - equilibrated with 50 mm tris - hcl ( ph 8.0 ) , 0.5 mm dtt and 0.1 % ( v / v ) triton x - 100 .
subsequently , the column was washed with 200 ml of the same buffer .
elution of proteins was achieved with a linear salt gradient from 0 to 0.5 m kcl at a flow rate of 2 ml / min .
fractions containing hydrogenase activity eluted at approximately 0.2 m kcl .
h2 - oxidizing activity was checked photometrically and by activity stained blue native ( bn ) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( page ) , while purity was checked by sds page and silver - stained bn page .
blue native gel activity staining page and sds page non - denaturing page was performed with native gels from serva ( servagel n , heidelberg , germany ) .
the anaerobic running buffer system was composed of a cathode buffer ( 50 mm tricine , 15 mm bistris - hcl , 1 ml / l serva blue g ; ph 7.0 ) and anode buffer ( 15 mm bistris - hcl ; ph 7.0 ) .
samples were mixed with twofold loading dye ( 1 m 6 - aminocaproic acid ; 100 mm bistris - hcl ph 7.0 ; 100 mm nacl ; 20 % glycerol ; 0.1 % serva blue g250 ) .
the protein marker used was a serva native marker liquid mix .
the gels were run in a vertical polyacrylamide electrophoresis system ( minigel - twin , biometra gmbh , gottingen , germany ) starting with 50 v for 10 min and subsequently 200 v for about 2 h. the gel electrophoresis was performed in an anoxic glovebox ( coy laboratory products inc. , grass lake , mi , usa ) .
h2 - oxidizing activity was visualized as follows : the gel was transferred to an anoxic schott bottle filled with 50 mm tris - hcl ( ph 8.0 ) buffer containing 1 mm benzyl viologen ( bv ) as primary electron acceptor and redox mediator and 1 mm triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ( ttc ) as terminal electron acceptor for permanent staining .
the bottle was then flushed with pure h2 for 30 min .
the incubation was carried out in a 28degreesc water bath until first bands were visible and then stopped by removing the native gel from the bottle .
fractions obtained from enrichment procedure were subjected to sds - page , which was silver stained after the run .
photometric measurement of hydrogenase activity h2 - oxidizing activity was measured spectrophotometrically in butyl rubber stoppered glass cuvettes filled with 1 ml h2 - saturated buffer ( 50 mm tris - hcl , ph 8.0 ) made anoxic by flushing with h2 for 5 min .
redox dyes used were 1 mm benzyl viologen ( bv ) , 1 mm methyl viologen ( mv ) , or 1 mm methylene blue ( mb ) at 30degreesc .
the colorization caused by the reduction of bv or mv was recorded at 578 nm and decolorization of mb was monitored at 570 nm. additionally , activity was measured with the menaquinone analogs 1,4 - naphthoquinone and 2,3 - dimethyl - 1,4 - naphthoquinone ( dmn ) .
changes in absorption during reduction of these derivatives were recorded at 270 nm. the anoxic reaction buffer contained 0.2 mm dmn or 1,4 - naphthoquinone in 50 mm glycylglycine ( ph 8.0 ) and 0.5 mm dtt .
the assay was performed in rubber - stoppered quartz cuvettes , flushed with h2 .
reduction of dmn was recorded using the absorbance difference at 270 and 290 nm. determination of protein concentration was done according to the method of bradford ( 1976 ) .
activity values are given in nanokatal ( oxidation of 1 nmol h2 per second ) .
temperature and ph dependance was measured with enriched hydrogenase using a 50 mm britton - robinson buffer system ( 50 mm h3bo3 , 50 mm h3po4 , 50 mm acetate ) in a ph range from 5.5 to 10 and a temperature range between 10 and 50degreesc .
isolation of rna , reverse transcription , and quantitative real - time pcr isolation of total rna from s. multivorans was done using the rneasy minikit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) .
remaining genomic dna was removed with dnase i ( rnase free ; roche , mannheim , germany ) .
for quality check of the rna , agarose gel electrophoresis was performed .
for all quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) experiments , the rna was isolated in the mid - exponential growth phase of three independently grown cultures .
for cdna synthesis , 1 mug of rna was used as starting material in the revertaid first strand cdna synthesis kit ( thermo scientific , schwerte , germany ) .
the reaction mixture contained 1 mug rna , 2.5 mul reverse primer , 3.5 mul 5x reaction buffer , and 2 mul 10 mm dntp mix .
it was filled up to a final volume of 17.5 mul with pcr - grade water ( fermentas , st. leon rot , germany ) .
to 10.5 mul of the mix , 0.5 mul revertaid reverse transcriptase ( rt ; 200 u / mul ) was added , the residual amount ( mix without rt ) was used as negative control .
the mix was incubated for 1 h at 42degreesc in a thermo cycler ( mastercycler , personal , eppendorf , hamburg , germany ) and the reaction was stopped at 72degreesc for 5 min .
transcript levels of the different genes were compared by qpcr with the maxima sybr green qpcr master mix ( fermentas , st. leon rot , germany ) ; the primer pairs used are listed in supplementary table 1 .
the assay was performed in triplicates in a cfx96 qpcr machine ( bio - rad , munich , germany ) .
the pcr reaction mixture included 2.5 mul cdna , 0.5 mum of each primer , and 6 mul 2x maxima sybr green qpcr master mix and was filled up to a final volume of 12 mul with pcr - grade water .
two negative controls were used , one with water as qpcr template and a reverse transcriptase negative control for each tested gene .
melting curve analysis was performed to exclude the formation of primer dimers or unspecific byproducts .
before performing the qpcr experiments , primer efficiency was tested for all primer pairs used in this study to ensure accurate and comparable amplification ( see supplementary data sheet 2 ) .
three different control genes for normalization were tested : 16s rrna , reca , rpob .
only the first was useful as control gene under all growth conditions applied .
obtained data were thus normalized to 16s cdna ( diluted 1:10,000 ) and the calculation of the relative gene expression level was done according to the 2 - deltadeltact method ( schmittgen and livak , 2008 ) , except where stated otherwise .
for statistical analysis , student 's t - test was performed on the deltact - values ; p - values lower than 0.05 were regarded as significant .
results transcript levels of hydrogenase genes under different growth conditions to determine and compare the transcript levels of the hydrogenase genes under different growth conditions , s. multivorans was grown with the following substrate combinations : pyruvate plus fumarate ( standard condition ) , pce , 5 % o2 , or without external electron acceptor , or h2 plus pce or nitrate .
in addition , n2 - fixing conditions were achieved with n2 as sole nitrogen source .
prior to the main qpcr experiments , three housekeeping genes were tested for their suitability as reference genes : 16s rrna , reca and rpob .
the latter was not considered further due to unspecific products and primer specificities out of an acceptable range ( more than 10 % deviation from primer specificities for the other primer pairs ) .
the reca gene was unsuitable , since the transcript levels varied too much among replicates and under the different growth conditions ( see supplementary data sheet 2 ) .
therefore , hydrogenase qpcr data were normalized to the 16s rrna gene when comparing transcript levels under different growth conditions .
for hydrogenase qpcr , the following genes encoding the catalytic subunits of each hydrogenase gene cluster were chosen : hydb ( smul _ 1424 ) of the mbh gene cluster , hupl ( smul _ 1422 ) from the cytoplasmic uptake hydrogenase ( hupsl ) , eche ( smul _ 1307 ) from the cooh - like hydrogenase and hyfg ( smul _ 2388 ) from the hyf hydrogenase .
primers used in qpcr are listed in supplementary table 1 .
transcripts of only two hydrogenase genes , hydb and hyfg ( large subunits of the mbh and of hyf ) were found at levels of 0.03 to 0.08 ( after normalization to 16s rrna transcript level ) under nearly all tested growth conditions .
this was even the case when pyruvate rather than h2 was used as electron donor in cells cultivated for at least 50 transfers with pyruvate as sole energy source .
a long - term transcriptional regulatory effect , as was seen for pcea ( john et al. , 2009 ) , can therefore be excluded .
opposed to hydb and hyfg , hupl and eche transcripts were not detected under most conditions , except very low transcript levels under pyruvate / fumarate ( below 0.001 , see figure 2 and supplementary data sheet 2 ) .
to establish the hydrogenases that are involved in h2 - dependent pce respiration , s. multivorans was grown in the presence of 100 % h2 in the gas phase as electron donor and 10 mm pce in a hexadecane phase as electron acceptor .
only an insignificant increase in hydb transcript level ( about twofold , p - value 0.224 ) and a decrease of hyfg ( about threefold , p - value 0.562 ) was observed ( figure 2 ) .
to compare these transcript levels to those of another anaerobic h2 - dependent respiration , cells were grown with nitrate as electron acceptor and h2 as electron donor .
nitrate rather than fumarate was chosen as electron acceptor , since s. multivorans was shown to be capable of growth with fumarate alone by disproportionation ( scholz - muramatsu et al. , 1995 ) .
the hydb gene transcript level dropped slightly , but insignificantly compared to h2 / pce ( twofold , p - value 0.384 ) , while hyfg was reduced significantly in h2 / nitrate cells ( about 30 - fold lower ; p - value 0.022 ) ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 transcription pattern of hydrogenase catalytic subunit genes of s. multivorans grown under different growth conditions .
transcript levels of hydrogenase genes were normalized to those of the 16s rrna gene .
all data were obtained from three biological replicates and three technical replicates .
when amplification was detected only in one biological replicate , the hydrogenase gene was designated as not detected ( n.d. ) .
the raw data of all values are shown in the supplementary data sheet 2 .

since hupsl might be involved in recycling hydrogen produced during n2 fixation , as was shown for similar enzymes in cyanobacteria ( tamagnini et al. , 2007 ; bothe et al. , 2010 ) and s. multivorans was shown to fix n2 ( ju et al. , 2007 ; goris et al. , 2014 ) , the transcript levels of hupl were investigated with n2 as sole n - source. s. multivorans was grown under standard conditions ( pyruvate / fumarate plus nh4cl as n - source ) and with medium containing n2 as sole n - source .
the hupl transcript level did not increase with n2 as sole n - source when compared to cells grown with nh4 + .
instead , hupl and hydb levels decreased about 7.5 - and 3 - fold , albeit insignificantly with a p - value of 0.592 and 0.892 , respectively ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 transcription pattern of hydrogenase catalytic subunit genes of s. multivorans with n2 as sole n - source and 5 % o2 as electron acceptor .
transcript levels obtained from cells grown with n2 as n - source and 5 % o2 were normalized to the transcript levels of the corresponding hydrogenase genes of pyruvate / fumarate grown cells .
all data were obtained from three biological replicates and three technical replicates .
when amplification was detected only in one biological replicate , the hydrogenase gene was designated as not detected ( n.d. ) .
the raw data of all values are shown in the supplementary data sheet 2 and figure 1 shows the data normalized to 16s rrna gene .
hydb , membrane - bound hydrogenase ( mbh ) ; hupl , cytoplasmic uptake hydrogenase ; hyfg , hyf - hydrogenase ; eche , ech - like hydrogenase .
pyr , pyruvate ; fum , fumarate ; nh4cl , with ammonium chloride ; n2 , n2 as sole n - source .
aerobic growth of s. multivorans with pyruvate and an o2 - concentration of about 5 % in the gas phase was described recently ( goris et al. , 2014 ) .
since nife hydrogenases are generally inactivated by o2 ( stiebritz and reiher , 2012 ) , it was of interest whether o2 could possibly cause a down - regulation of hydrogenase gene expression as found for other bacteria ( kovacs et al. , 2005 ) .
therefore , qpcr of cells grown in the presence of 5 % o2 in the gas phase with pyruvate as electron donor was performed to test if hydrogenase transcription occurs in the presence of oxygen .
cells were harvested at an o2 concentration in the medium of at least 0.2 mg / l. surprisingly , the transcript levels of hydb and hyfg were similar or insignificantly higher ( about twofold for hydb , p - value of 0.553 ) under microoxic conditions compared to cells grown with fumarate as electron acceptor ( figure 3 ) , while hupl and eche transcripts were not detected .
the cells were , however , not able to grow with h2 as electron donor and 5 % o2 as electron acceptor and acetate as carbon source .
sulfurospirillum multivorans was described to grow fermentatively with pyruvate as the sole energy source ( scholz - muramatsu et al. , 1995 ) .
to investigate whether one of the putative h2 - producing hydrogenases shows higher transcript levels under this growth condition , we compared qpcr results obtained from pyruvate - grown cells with those from pyruvate / fumarate - grown cells .
the hydb transcript level was lowered insignificantly ( p - value 0.229 ) about threefold , while the hyfg level was increased by a factor of 3 with a p - value of 0.056 ( figure 4 ) .

transcript levels obtained from cells grown with pyruvate in the absence of an electron acceptor were normalized to the transcript levels of the corresponding hydrogenase genes of pyruvate / fumarate grown cells .
all data were obtained from three biological replicates and three technical replicates .
when amplification was detected in less than two biological replicates , the hydrogenase gene was designated as not detected ( n.d. ) .
the raw data of all values are shown in the supplementary data sheet 2 and figure 1 shows the data normalized to 16s rrna gene .

biochemical characterization of the membrane - bound hydrogenase to biochemically characterize the h2 - oxidizing enzyme of cells grown under pce - respiring conditions , we measured the h2 - uptake activity of subcellular fractions from s. multivorans in different enzymatic assays .
first , crude extracts of cells grown with pyruvate or h2 as electron donor and pce as electron acceptor were tested spectrophotometrically for h2 - oxidizing activity with several different artificial redox mediators as electron acceptors .
the activity with bv was by far the highest and about five times higher than the activities with mv and approximately tenfold of the activity with mb ( figure 5a ) .
the other redox mediators tested , nad + , nitro blue tetrazolium chloride ( nbt ) or phenazine methosulfate ( pms ) , and negative controls without h2 or without cell extracts showed no activity ( supplementary table 2 ) .
in accordance with the quantitative pcr results , there was not much difference in the activity levels between pyruvate / pce - and h2 / pce - grown cells , with a specific h2 - oxidizing activity of 60 nkat / mg protein with bv as electron acceptor for pyruvate / pce cells , 50 nkat / mg for pyruvate / fumarate cells and 70 nkat / mg for h2 / pce cells ( figure 5a ) .
crude extracts obtained from cells grown with pyruvate as electron donor and 5 % o2 as electron acceptor showed h2 - dependent enzyme activity with bv ( 25 +/ - 2.3 nkat / mg ) .
after subcellular fractionation , the highest specific activity ( about 60 nkat / mg ) was found in the mf while only around one tenth ( 7 and 5 nkat / mg for extracts obtained from pyruvate - and h2 - grown cells , respectively ) was measured for the sf. the activities of crude extract , mf and solubilized mes were about 50 to 70 nkat / mg ( figure 5b ) .

data are calculated from three independent biological and technical replicates .

the different subcellular fractions were subjected to native page followed by activity staining .
this method allows to estimate the size and activity of catalytically active enzyme complexes and is often routinely used for the characterization of hydrogenases ( ballantine and boxer , 1985 ; pinske et al. , 2012 ) .
for this purpose , s. multivorans cells were grown with either pyruvate or h2 as electron donor and pce as electron acceptor .
both , cell extracts and subcellular fractions ( sf and me solubilized with digitonin ) , were subjected to activity staining with bv as primary and ttc ( triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ) as secondary electron acceptor .
after incubation of the gel with h2 for 15 - 30 min at 28degreesc , a distinct band showing the typical reddish color of reduced ttc appeared at a size of about 270 kda .
this band was missing or only weakly visible in the sf ( figure 6 ) .
a prolonged incubation time up to 12 h did not lead to an additional band in the activity staining with membrane or sfs , suggesting the involvement of only one hydrogenase in h2 oxidation , albeit a hydrogenase not performing h2 oxidation under the given conditions might have been overlooked in this assay .
the size of 270 kda correlates to a dimeric form of the heterotrimeric s. multivorans mbh , which is predicted to be around 244 kda ( predicted sizes for the maturated mbh - large subunit hydb : 62 kda , small subunit hyda : 34 kda , and the membrane - integral cytochrome b , hydc : 26 kda ) .
this value , however , does not take into account the unknown contribution of the digitonin micelle size .

the presumable physiological electron acceptor for the mbh is menaquinone , as was shown for the mbh from w. succinogenes ( dross et al. , 1992 ) .
to test the h2 - dependent reactivity of the mbh of s. multivorans with quinones , h2 oxidation activity was measured spectrophotometrically with two different quinone analogs .
similar to the mbh of w. succinogenes , crude and mes of s. multivorans showed activity with 2,3 - dimethyl - 1,4 - naphtoquinone ( dmn ) ( table 1 ) .
extracts from cells grown with h2 showed approximately 10 % higher activities than those from cells grown with pyruvate ( table 1 ) .
the hydrophilic quinone analog , 1,4 - naphthoquinone , was neither reduced by the mbh of s. multivorans nor by that of w. succinogenes ( dross et al. , 1992 ) .

to investigate the involvement of a cytochrome b , spectroscopic changes in uv / vis absorption of mfs were recorded before and after the addition of h2 .
the mf showed an absorption maximum at 414 nm in the absence of h2 .
after flushing the sample with h2 , the soret band at 414 nm shifted to 427 nm and two peaks at 530 and 561 nm appeared ( figure 7a ) .
when calculating the difference spectra of h2 - reduced minus oxidized state , the spectrum showed alpha - , beta - , and gamma - absorption peaks at 561 , 530 , and 427 nm , respectively ( figure 7b ) .
these spectral properties correspond to absorption spectra of b - type cytochromes ( yoon et al. , 2008 ; eguchi et al. , 2012 ) .

cells were grown with pyruvate / pce .
enrichment of the membrane - bound hydrogenase attempts to express the mbh of s. multivorans heterologously did not lead to the formation of an active enzyme , therefore , an enrichment from mes was carried out ( figure 8 ) .
after solubilization of the mf with digitonin , 18 % of hydrogenase enzyme activity from the mf could be recovered .
an enrichment of 221 - fold was obtained using anion exchange chromatography with a q - sepharose column ( table 2 ) .
after elution , the fractions with the highest activities ( fractions 19 - 23 ) were applied to sds - page , native page and bn activity staining ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
in the latter , all fractions showed the remarkable red band at 270 kda , which was most intense in fractions 20 and 21 .
similar to the cell extracts , no second band was visible after prolonged incubation ( up to 12 h ) in the reaction mixture .
silver stained native page showed the same 270 kda band in all applied fractions with the most intense band in fraction 20 ( figure 8a ) .
other distinct bands in fraction 20 appeared around 50 and 130 kda .
after sds - page , all tested fractions showed a band at about 65 kda , which corresponds to the size of hydb ( 62 kda ) .
this band was strongest in fractions 20 and 21 .
additionally , a band at nearly 35 kda was showing up in fractions 20 to 23 , correlating to the theoretical size of the mature small subunit of the mbh ( 34 kda ) .
several bands between 25 and 30 kda were visible in all fractions , but none of them could be attributed clearly to hydc ( 26 kda ) .
one predominant band at 25 kda observed in fractions 20 and 21 might represent a cytochrome b , especially since both fractions showed activity with dmn as electron acceptor ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
fraction 20 appeared to exhibit less additional bands than fraction 21 after sds - page ( supplementary figure 2 ) , therefore , we chose this fraction for further purification .
hydrophobic interaction chromatography or gel filtration did not lead to further enrichment of active trimeric mbh , so that further characterization was performed with fraction 20 .
the presence of the membrane - integral cytochrome b ( hydc ) in this fraction was shown using uv / vis spectroscopy .
the same characteristic absorption spectra and difference spectrum were recorded as those obtained for the mf ( supplementary figure 3 ) .
compared to the membranes , the enriched mbh showed a higher absorption in the difference spectrum , suggesting a higher cytochrome b concentration .
the optimal condition for h2 oxidation by fraction 20 was at ph 8.0 and 40degreesc when bv was used as electron acceptor in the photometric assay .

discussion to identify hydrogenases involved in the hydrogen - oxidation during pce respiration in s. multivorans , we performed transcription analysis and biochemical investigations with cells grown in the presence of different electron donor / acceptor combinations. of the previously identified four nife hydrogenases encoded in the genome of s. multivorans , a membrane - bound hydrogenase similar to the hydrogen - oxidizing mbh from w. succinogenes was suggested to play a role in hydrogen oxidation during pce respiration .
however , the only evidence for this assumption was based on amino acid sequence similarities to other hydrogen - oxidizing enzymes and cell extracts grown with h2 and fumarate ( miller et al. , 1996 ; goris et al. , 2014 ) , which did not allow for an unambiguous conclusion of its role in pce respiration .
since up to now no detailed information on the composition of organohalide respiratory chains is available , it is feasible that one of the other three hydrogenases might be involved .
in the transcript level analysis presented here , only two of the four hydrogenase large subunit genes were found to be transcribed to a considerable amount .
the first is hydb , encoding the large subunit of the mbh similar to that of w. succinogenes , while the second , hyfg , belongs to a group 4 hydrogenase ( vignais and billoud , 2007 ) similar to hydrogenases 3 and 4 of e. coli ( hyc and hyf ) .
the hydb transcript level was found not to be significantly altered during any of the tested growth conditions .
the presence of the mbh and hyf with pyruvate or formate as electron donor was already seen in a previous proteomic study ( goris et al. , 2015 ) ( supplementary data sheet 3 ) .
this points toward a constitutive expression of the mbh in s. multivorans .
as this was tested in cells long - term cultivated without h2 , a regulatory effect as reported earlier for pce respiration ( john et al. , 2009 ) can be also excluded .
post - transcriptional regulation and maturation could also have an influence on the hydrogen - oxidizing activity and the responsible hydrogenase .
the biochemical analyses with extracts obtained from cells grown under different conditions revealed comparable h2 - oxidizing activities regardless of the electron donor or acceptor used .
also , h2 had no apparent influence on the maturation of the mbh , since the h2 - oxidizing activity in the me did not change when cultures were grown with h2 .
furthermore , we conclude that only one hydrogenase plays a role in hydrogen oxidation under all growth conditions tested , since only one band was detected in bn activity staining regardless of the growth condition .
however , the blue native activity staining was performed only with the primary electron acceptor bv. therefore , the presence of another hydrogen - oxidizing enzyme requiring a different electron acceptor cannot be completely ruled out .
activity - stained bn page of a hydrogen - oxidizing enzyme enriched from s. multivorans showed a band corresponding to the same size .
sds page analysis of the subunit composition revealed subunits with molecular masses corresponding to the three subunits hydabc of the mbh .
spectroscopic analysis of the enriched enzyme revealed characteristic spectra of b - type cytochromes , indicating the presence of a cytochrome b in the enrichment .
these results are in accordance with spectra obtained from membranes and from the purified mbh of w. succinogenes .
in addition , the h2 - dependent reduction of the quinone analog dmn indicates that electrons derived from h2 oxidation are transferred via the membrane - integral cytochrome b to the menaquinone pool ( figure 9a ) .
previous studies suggested the involvement of menaquinone and a quinol dehydrogenase in the pce respiratory chain ( goris et al. , 2014 , 2015 ) , which supports the assumption that the mbh - mediated hydrogen oxidation is coupled to pce reduction via menaquinone .

the apparent molecular mass of the native enzyme points to a heterotrimeric mbh dimer .
this is opposed to a putative trimeric composition of the heterotrimeric complex of cupriavidus necator mbh ( frielingsdorf et al. , 2011 ) .
instead , the s. multivorans complex resembles the e. coli hydrogenase 1 crystallized as a heterotrimer ( volbeda et al. , 2013 ) , albeit the latter was reported to contain only one cytochrome for a hydrogenase dimer .
a dimeric structure is not only found for e. coli hydrogenase 1 , but also found in several other hydrogenase crystal structures , although these were solved without a membrane - integral subunit ( wulff et al. , 2016 ) .
the broad array of growth conditions used for real - time pcr experiments in this study revealed that under none of the conditions tested neither hupl nor eche were induced .
in contrast , hydb was expressed under all growth conditions , even with o2 as electron acceptor .
the latter observation was surprising , since epsilonproteobacteria including s. multivorans do not harbor oxygen - tolerant nife hydrogenases and most nife hydrogenases suffer from inactivation when exposed to o2 .
therefore , many facultative anaerobic bacteria employ mechanisms to down - regulate the expression of hydrogenase genes in the presence of o2 .
for example , hydrogenase gene transcription is under control of regulators arcab and fnr in other facultative anaerobic proteobacteria including e. coli ( richard et al. , 1999 ; kovacs et al. , 2005 ) .
none of these regulators is found in epsilonproteobacteria , which might explain the lack of o2 - induced down - regulation of hydrogenase gene expression .
many free - living epsilonproteobacteria are facultative microaerophilic and often found in the oxic - anoxic interface , where the o2 concentration varies ( vetriani et al. , 2003 ; grote et al. , 2012 ) .
therefore , a constitutive expression of the hydrogen - uptake system and the lack of an o2 - sensitive regulation system may be beneficial to these organisms .
although all attempts to grow s. multivorans with h2 and o2 as energy substrates failed so far , it is feasible that the organism might use h2 as additional electron donor under very low o2 partial pressure as described elsewhere for other epsilonproteobacteria ( e.g. , campylobacter jejuni and helicobacter pylori ) ( laanbroek et al. , 1977 , 1978 ; carlone and lascelles , 1982 ; maier et al. , 2003 ) .
since crude extracts from cells grown with o2 still showed around half of the activity as anaerobically grown cells , this seems feasible for s. multivorans .
the presence of h2 in the gas phase did not raise the transcript level of the mbh significantly .
on the molecular level , this might be attributed to a missing h2 sensor such as that found in some " knallgas " bacteria ( kleihues et al. , 2000 ; friedrich et al. , 2005 ) .
the absence of regulatory proteins with the exception of the nickel - dependent nikr ( goris et al. , 2014 ) is in accordance with a constitutive expression of the mbh in s. multivorans .
the constitutive expression of the mbh might also be an advantage in anoxic environments where nutrient composition and h2 levels are often changing .
the role of the hyf hydrogenase in s. multivorans remains enigmatic .
the key enzyme in mixed acid fermentation in e. coli is the pyruvate formate lyase ( pfl ) , generating formate , which is the substrate for the fhl complex .
an ortholog of the pfl is not encoded in the genome of s. multivorans .
while the amino acid sequences of s. multivorans hyf subunits are similar ( 33 to 50 % amino acid sequence identity ) to those of hydrogenase 4 of e. coli , the s. multivorans hyf gene cluster does not contain any genes encoding formate - metabolism related proteins as found in the hyf cluster of e. coli ( e.g. , the formate channel focb or a formate - sensitive transcriptional regulator ) .
a gene encoding a putative cytoplasmic formate dehydrogenase is found in the genome of s. multivorans , but the according protein sequence shows only 30 % amino acid sequence identity to fdhf of the fhl complex of e. coli .
additionally , an ortholog of the s. multivorans fdh is found in many epsilonproteobacterial genomes not encoding the hyf hydrogenase .
all this renders participation of hyf in an fhl complex in s. multivorans an unlikely scenario .
instead , we assume that hyf could serve to dispose of excess reducing equivalents , accepting electrons , e.g. , from ferredoxin reduced by a pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase ( pfor ) , similar to the group 4 hydrogenase of pyrococcus furiosus ( mcternan et al. , 2015 ) .
the ferredoxin and the pfor were found to be present in the proteome in s. multivorans previously ( goris et al. , 2015 ) .
we assume that s. multivorans produces h2 especially under fermentative conditions ( figure 9b ) or when the concentration of the electron acceptor may be limiting .
this is probably the case for pce , which , even in polluted environments , could be present at low concentrations due to its low solubility .
in contrast , nitrate may be available at higher concentrations , which might explain the down - regulation exclusively with h2 / nitrate as substrates .
the role and function of this hydrogenase is subject to further studies currently conducted in our laboratory .
the role of the cytoplasmic uptake hydrogenase hupsl remains unclear in s. multivorans .
a tetr - like transcriptional repressor which is encoded directly upstream of the hupsl cluster ( goris et al. , 2014 ) might repress the transcription of the enzyme under the tested growth conditions .
the function of hupsl in recycling of h2 as a byproduct of n2 fixation can be excluded , since growth with n2 as sole n - source did not lead to an elevated transcript level , which would have been expected in that case .
a role in reducing a cytoplasmic low - potential electron donor such as reduced ferredoxin providing electrons for the reductive tca cycle seems feasible , as was suggested for a similar hydrogenase in a. aeolicus ( guiral et al. , 2005 ) .
the proteins for the rtca cycle are encoded in the genome of s. multivorans ( goris et al. , 2014 ) , but autotrophic growth was never observed .
like for the hupl gene , also eche transcripts were only found in negligible amounts in this study .
all ech subunits bear high similarity to the co - induced hydrogenase of c. hydrogenoformans , in which the hydrogenase genes are located adjacent to a co dehydrogenase gene ( soboh et al. , 2002 ) .
in the genome of sulfurospirillum sp. scadc , this structure is still conserved ( tan and foght , 2014 ; goris and diekert , 2016 ) and s. carboxydovorans is reported to use co as electron donor ( jensen and finster , 2005 ) .
hence , a loss of the co dehydrogenase gene and non - functionality of the co - induced like hydrogenase in s. multivorans is possible .
however , it is also feasible that growth conditions , which induce transcription of the hup and ech genes , were not tested in this study .
for example , ph variation or different levels of h2 concentrations , which could have an effect on hydrogenase expression , was not included here .
conclusion in this study we showed that s. multivorans involves a membrane - bound nife hydrogenase similar to the mbh of w. succinogenes for h2 oxidation in the pce - respiratory chain .
the mbh , which was enriched with a redox - active , membrane - integral cytochrome b , reacts most likely with the quinone pool and forms a native complex of around 270 kda .
the transcript studies presented here show that the mbh is not subject to a distinct h2 - or o2 - dependent regulation as reported for other organisms .
besides the mbh , only one more hydrogenase gene transcript ( hyf type ) was found under the growth conditions applied in this study .
this cytoplasmic , membrane - bound hydrogenase complex with similarities to hyf from e. coli is most likely playing a role in proton reduction under electron acceptor - limiting conditions .
taken together , this study allows a deeper insight into the h2 metabolism of a model organohalide - respiring bacterium and a free - living epsilonproteobacterium .

the natural alkaloid berberine has been ascribed numerous health benefits including lipid and cholesterol reduction and improved insulin sensitivity in diabetics .
however , oral ( po ) administration of berberine is hindered by poor bioavailability and increasing dose often elicits gastro - intestinal side effects .
to overcome the caveats associated with oral berberine , we developed transdermal ( td ) formulations of berberine ( bbr ) and the berberine precursor dihydroberberine ( dhb ) .
these formulations were compared to oral bbr using pharmacokinetics , metabolism , and general safety studies in vivo .
to complete this work , a sensitive quantitative lc - ms / ms method was developed and validated according the fda guidelines for bioanalytical methods to simultaneously measure berberine , simvastatin , and simvastatin hydroxy acid with relative quantification used for the berberine metabolite demethylene berberine glucuronide ( dbg ) .
acute pharmacokinetics in sprague - dawley rats demonstrated a statistically relevant ranking for berberine bioavailability based upon auc0 - 8 as dhb td > bbr td >> bbr po with similar ranking for the metabolite dbg , indicating that transdermal administration achieves bbr levels well above oral administration .
similarly , chronic administration ( 14 days ) resulted in significantly higher levels of circulating bbr and dbg in dhb td treated animals .
chronically treated rats were given a single dose of simvastatin with no observed change in the drugs bioavailability compared with control , suggesting the increased presence of bbr had no effect on simvastatin metabolism .
this observation was further supported by consistent cyp3a4 expression across all treatment groups .
moreover , no changes in kidney and liver biomarkers , including alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase , were observed between treatment formats , and confirming previous reports that bbr has no effect on hmg - coa expression .
this study supports the safe use of transdermal compositions that improve on the poor bioavailability of oral berberine and have the potential to be more efficacious in the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia .

introduction berberine ( bbr ) is a natural alkaloid found in a variety of plant species including barberry ( berberis ) , meadow rue ( thalictrum ) , celandine ( chelidonium ) , and goldenseal ( hydrastis canadensis ) [ 1 - 4 ] .
bbr has been investigated for a variety of health benefits including anti - microbial [ 5,6 ] , anti - inflammatory [ 7 ] , chemotherapeutic [ 8 ] , anti - diabetic [ 9,10 ] , as well as cholesterol and lipid - lowering properties [ 11,12 ] .
regarding the latter , berberine is widely used in humans as a natural supplement to aid the management of dyslipidemia [ 13 ] .
the anti - microbial activity has a pronounced effect on the gut microbiota and often translates into adverse events or dose reduction in clinical trials investigating the value of bbr treatment for diabetes and dyslipidemia [ 10,14,15 ] .
the need to reduce dosage in these studies relates to the high levels of bbr required to achieve effectiveness ( 1,000 - 1,500 mg per day ) , a result of the poor bioavailability of oral bbr [ 16,17 ] .
several oral formulation techniques such as encapsulation [ 18,19 ] , spray drying [ 20 ] and the co - administration with p - glycoprotein inhibitors [ 9 ] , have been used to attempt to overcome the inherently poor bioavailability of bbr .
for example , yu et. al. , demonstrated a polyethylene glycol and phosphatidylcholine encapsulation of oral bbr with improved pharmacokinetic parameters including the peak serum concentration ( cmax ) and area under the curve ( auc ) by ~ 3 - fold [ 18 ] .
however , oral formulations may unavoidably encounter gastrointestinal side effects and the use of complex non - medicinal excipients or processes may complicate the clinical translation and commercialization of such products .
in 2008 , kong et al showed that oral bbr had lipid lowering effects when used in combination with statin drugs in hyperlipidemic rats [ 21 ] .
this precedent led to the hypothesis that berberine could be used alone or in conjunction with statins for the treatment of dyslipidemia .
additionally , preclinical studies have suggested bbr may be hepatoprotective from a variety of chemical insults [ 22 - 24 ] .
for example , germoush and mahmoud demonstrated that bbr rescued the hepatic damage associated with cyclophosphamide treatment [ 24 ] .
indeed , bbr has been shown to affect the metabolism of drugs through changes in cyp3a4 expression [ 25 ] .
the effects of bbr on cyp3a4 - mediated drug metabolism is of particular interest as this enzyme degrades several widely used statin drugs ( e.g. simvastatin and lovastatin ) that may be concomitantly used with bbr to treat dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia [ 25,26 ] .
although an enhanced bbr formulation may yield an increase in bioavailability , it may also generate unwanted side - effects such as alterations in hepatic health and metabolism of other compounds .
to overcome concerns of bioavailability , gastrointestinal side effects , and investigate the safety and drug interactions of bbr we developed transdermal formulations of bbr and the reduced derivative , dihydroberberine ( dhb ) .
simultaneous pharmacokinetic analysis of bbr and simvastatin using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) allowed us to compare bioavailability via different delivery routes as well as to investigate any possible interactions between bbr or dhb with this statin drug .
experimental the analytical method for the quantification of berberine , simvastatin and simvastatin hydroxy acid described within was developed and validated according to the fda bioanalytical method validation guidance document [ 27 ] .
no analytical standard for demethylene berberine glucuronide ( dbg ) was available , and therefore the quantification method for that metabolite was not validated .
chemicals and reagents berberine chloride hydrate ( 14050 ) , potassium carbonate ( p5833 ) , sodium hydroxide ( s8045 ) and chloroform ( 650498 ) were purchased from sigma aldrich .

the first 6 minutes of the gradient program was isocratic with 45 % a and then phase b was increased to 100 % by 9 minutes and held at 100 % until 13 minutes .
the initial conditions ( 45 % a ) were then re - equilibrated for 5 minutes .
the sample injection volume was 10 mul , the column temperature was 40 degreesc and the autosampler temperature was maintained at 20 degreesc .
mass spectrometer conditions the mass spectrometer was operated in bipolar mode , observing analytes bbr , d6 - bbr , dbg , sim , d6 - sim , sha and d6 - sha using the parameters outlined in tables 1 and 2 .
a multiple reaction monitoring ( mrm ) pair for dhb was not included in the analysis because it is quickly oxidized to bbr once absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream [ 28 ] .

the accuracy was calculated from nominal concentration ( cnom ) and mean observed concentration with the calculation bias (%) = [( cobs - cnom )/ ( cnom )] x 100 % .
extraction recovery and matrix effect extraction recovery of analytes from rat serum ( n = 6 ) was assessed by comparing the peak area of the extracted analyte to those of blank serum extracts spiked with standard solutions .
the extraction recoveries of qc samples at three concentrations were calculated as the percent of peak area of extracted analyte to peak area of spiked analyte .
matrix effects on analytes were assessed by comparing the peak area of analytes in the extraction solvent with peak areas of analytes of the same concentration in blank serum extracts ( n = 6 ) .

chromatograms of ( a ) blank serum ( b ) blank serum spiked with ( 1 ) d6 - sha ( 156.25 ng / ml ) , ( 2 ) sha ( 62.5 ng / ml ) , ( 3 ) d6 - sim ( 156.25 ng / ml ) and ( 4 ) sim ( 62.5 ng / ml ) and ( c ) serum samples 2.5 hours after oral administration of sim ( 1 ) d6 - sha ( spiked - - 156.25 ng / ml ) ( 2 ) sha ( 3 ) d6 - sim ( spiked - - 156.25 ng / ml ) and ( 4 ) sim .
the lloq was 0.49 ng / ml for bbr , sim , and sha and the uloq was 62.5 ng / ml for bbr and 500 ng / ml for both sim and sha .
this is comparable to literature values [ 32 - 36 ] with some lloqs reported as low as 0.1 ng / ml for bbr , sim or sha .
the calibration curves for sim and sha were constructed using weighted linear regression of the peak area ratio of the analytes to their corresponding internal standard ( is ) vs. serum concentration of analytes over the range of 0.49 ng / ml to 500 ng / ml with regression equations : y = 0.0046x + 0.0048 for sim and y = 0.0071x + 0.0059 for sha .
the calibration curve for bbr was constructed using a weighted quadratic curve of the peak area ratio of the analytes to their corresponding is vs. serum concentration of analytes over the range of 0.49 ng / ml to 62.5 ng / ml. the bbr standard series was assigned the closest possible linear curve from 0.49 - 62.5 ng / ml to use to calculate a relative concentration to dbg from its ratio of peak area to d6 - bbr peak area .
the intraday and interday precision and accuracy results are summarized in table 3 .
all values were within recommended limits .
extraction recoveries analyzed at three concentrations for each analyte were greater than 84.6 % for all analytes ( table 4 ) .
matrix effects were low for bbr and sim but more pronounced for sha .
liu et al. reported a combined method for evaluation of bbr , sim and sha with low matrix effects for all analytes in plasma [ 36 ] .
the current method controlled for the sha matrix effects using deuterated internal standards .

while this reaction can be reduced through additional blood handling protocols we chose to quantify both analytes ( sim and sha ) to cumulatively reflect this drugs pharmacokinetics .
importantly , sim and sha were found to be stable in stock solutions , once biological samples began the extraction process , and maintained a concentration within +/ - 15 % of their initial concentration ( s1 table ) .
berberine and simvastatin hydroxy acid showed acceptable stability in serum at room temperature , during freeze thaw cycles , in stock solutions and in processed samples with responses that varied no more than 11 % of original concentration after subjection to test conditions .
acute berberine pharmacokinetics the pharmacokinetics of berberine after acute oral administration in rats was comparable to that found in previous reports [ 16 ] and devoid of any observable acute adverse events .
berberine blood levels resulting from topical administration has never been investigated to our knowledge and displayed enhanced bioavailability ( 3.6 x auc0 - 8 , p < 0.05 ) upon acute administration compared with orally treated animals ( table 5 ) .
while bbr td yielded higher berberine bioavailability ( auc0 - 8 ; 95.6 +/ - 23.7 ng.h / ml ) as compared to oral ( 26.5 +/ - 2.9 ng.h / ml ) this difference between routes of administration was not reflected in metabolite levels ( table 5 ) .
we hypothesize these results reflect the distinction between routes in terms of first - pass hepatic metabolism , wherein transdermal compounds bypass the liver while entering the systemic circulation and may also have distinct tissue distributions .
turner et. al. , reported that oral dhb was more bioavailable then oral berberine [ 40 ] , an observation that was reinforced by feng et. al .
[ 28 ] , who added that dhb converts to bbr rapidly in solution and in blood , and therefore berberine is an appropriate analyte for either dosage form .
we found that the enhanced oral bioavailability of dihydroberberine translates to improved transdermal permeation over both oral berberine ( 7.1 x auc0 - 8 , p < 0.05 ) and topical berberine ( 2.0 x auc0 - 8 ) after a single dose .
this may be related to the increased lipophilicity of dhb compared with bbr .
the time to maximum serum concentration ( tmax ) of berberine varied noticeably from group to group , occurring the earliest for bbr td ( fig 3a ) .
the maximum berberine serum concentrations occurred at 4h for dhb td and yielded an overall auc0 - 8 of 187.3 ng.h / ml , significantly higher than oral bbr ( table 5 ) .
this suggests that dhb td can yield ~ 7 - fold higher berberine bioavailability compared to oral bbr .
an additional dhb oral group would have been beneficial to compare the utility of td dhb , unfortunately due to the challenges in solubility and stability of dhb further development is required to ensure it is administered in its intended form .

although topical applications ( bbr td or dhb td ) produce measurable berberine levels in circulation , it is unclear if this results in accumulation of berberine within target tissues , such as the liver [ 41 ] .
to address this and gain insight into berberine metabolism we tandemly quantified a previously identified metabolite , demethylene berberine glucuronide ( dbg ) [ 31 ] .
systemic dbg concentration ( auc0 - 8 ) was significantly higher for dhb td as compared to all other treatment groups ( fig 3b & table 5 ) .
in general dhb td yielded a berberine and dbg pharmacokinetic pattern approaching zero - order kinetics typical of transdermal applications [ 42 ] .
chronic berberine pharmacokinetics and liver function while acute pharmacokinetics support the theory that transdermal administration of bbr and dhb overcome the poor bioavailability of oral administration , this natural supplement consumed by humans on a regular daily basis .
therefore , this optimized formulation and route of administration should be evaluated in both acute and chronic settings .
as such , sd rats were administered these same formulations along with a vehicle td once daily for a period of 14 days and serum was quantified for bbr and dbg ( fig 4 ) .
this duration of treatment ( 14 days ) was chosen to aid in identifying any overt issues with chronic use and is presumed sufficient to achieve steady - state kinetics .
during this experiment no statistical change in body weight or functional observational battery ( fob ) testing was observed as a response to chronic treatment .
however , mild skin redness appeared transiently in some animals within all transdermal groups .
chronic treatment with dhb td led to significantly higher concentrations of circulating berberine ( fig 4a ) and dbg ( fig 4b ) .
this was consistent with the higher bioavailability observed in the single - dose dhb td animals .
worthy of note is the clear distinction between dhb td and bbr td , with the latter generating levels approaching the lower limits of quantification .
indeed , this model of chronic administration supports a bioavailability ranking of dhb td >>> bbr po > bbr td .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0194979.g004 fig 4 comparative bioavailability of bbr formulations after 14 days of chronic administration .
male sprague - dawley rats ( n = 4 / group ) received once daily for 14 days administration of 90 mg / kg active via bbr oral gavage ( bbr po ) , 5 % ( w / w ) bbr transdermal formulation ( bbr td ) , and 5 % ( w / w ) dhb transdermal formulation ( dhb td ) or vehicle control ( vehicle td ) .
serum was collected on day 14 , two hours post - administration .
concentrations were measured by lc - ms / ms and ( a ) bbr levels were 19.6 , 0.5 , 1.0 , and 0.1 ng / ml and ( b ) relative dbg levels were 21.5 , 1.9 , 5.3 , and 0 ng / ml for dhb td , bbr td , bbr po , and vehicle td respectively .
statistical significance as compared to all other groups (* p < 0.05 ) is indicated .
error bars represent standard error of the mean .
to appropriately describe berberine pharmacokinetics during chronic administration , a complete pharmacokinetic assessment was completed following 16 days of once daily treatment ( fig 5 ) .
dhb td demonstrated a significantly higher berberine auc0 - 9 bioavailability as compared to oral ( fig 5a & table 6 ) .
in addition , the dhb td had comparably higher auc0 - 9 for dbg than all other groups including the bbr td. of note , the serum levels of berberine at time - zero ( fig 5 ) are comparable to those described in a separate cohort ( fig 4 ) , which illustrates dhb td as the most bioavailable formulation .
moreover , the levels of berberine and the metabolite dbg in circulation at time - zero are similar to those at the last observed time point , which suggests the dose and once daily regimen of dhb td may yield a steady - state presence of berberine .

comparing pharmacokinetic parameters between acute and chronic experiments , there was no statistically significant change in berberine auc levels for bbr td ( 95.6 +/ - 23.7 vs. 142.5 +/ - 99.8 ) or dhb td ( 187.3 +/ - 35.0 vs. 149.7 +/ - 10.4 ) .
in contrast , chronic oral administration demonstrates a ~ 5 - fold decrease ( 26.5 +/ - 2.9 vs. 4.8 +/ - 0.9 ; p = 0.0004 , unpaired t - test ) for berberine , possibly indicating a change in bioavailability which may be related to changes in the gastro - intestinal tract .
comparing pharmacokinetic parameters for dbg between acute and chronic experiments , the distinction between routes of administration is not present .
for both bbr po and dhb td there is an apparent decrease in dbg auc values from acute to chronic usage ( 66.0 +/ - 2.1 vs 47.7 +/ - 4.6 and 411.1 +/ - 29.3 vs. 190.7 +/ - 43.0 , respectively ) .
this decrease in dbg may reflect an alteration in hepatic function such as changes in enzymes responsible for berberine metabolism , of which cyp3a4 is a significant player [ 43 - 45 ] .
to address this possibility , liver samples from chronically treated animals ( 14 days ) were dissected and cyp3a4 was quantified by elisa and western blot ( fig 6 ) .
no differences in cyp3a4 expression were observed between treatment groups .
in addition , wu et. al. reported chronic oral berberine does not affect hepatic hmg - coa reductase expression [ 46 ] , an observation replicated in this study for oral and transdermal formulations .
together , 14 day chronic administration and the enhanced bioavailability of dhb td yields no overt alteration in hepatic xenobiotic metabolism ( fig 6a ) nor alters key rate - limiting enzymes ( fig 6b ) in this preliminary investigation .

male sprague - dawley rats ( n = 4 / group ) received once daily for 14 days administration of 90 mg / kg active via bbr oral gavage ( bbr po ) , 5 % ( w / w ) bbr transdermal formulation ( bbr td ) , and 5 % ( w / w ) dhb transdermal formulation ( dhb td ) or vehicle control ( vehicle td ) .
two liver samples / group were lysed and evaluated using commercially available colorimetric elisas for ( a ) cyp3a4 and ( b ) hmg - coa reductase or using western blot densitometry bioassays with beta - actin as reference signal for ( c ) cyp3a4 and ( d ) hmg - coa reductase .
no statistical difference between groups was observed ( example western blots provided in s1 fig ) .
error bars represent standard error of the mean .
furthermore , the absence of overt organ disruption is confirmed for both liver and kidneys .
blood clinical chemistry was performed at day 14 and included the evaluation of alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) , alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) , creatinine , and blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) ( fig 7 ) .
analysis of variance of clinical markers yielded no statistically significant differences between groups , and the overall levels are not diagnostic of a deleterious event when compared to acceptable veterinary ranges [ 47,48 ] .

whole blood was collected on day 14 and analyzed for biomarkers of hepatic and nephrotic function including ( a ) alt , ( b ) alp , ( c ) creatinine , and ( d ) bun .
error bars represent standard error of the mean .
simvastatin and berberine both undergo metabolism in the liver primarily through cyp3a4 [ 44,49 ] .
furthermore , liu et. al .
[ 36 ] , found that simvastatin treatment significantly increased plasma concentrations of berberine in animals that were administered a single dose of each , vs. animals that were treated with berberine alone .
as such , we set about evaluating the interaction between chronic berberine administration and acute simvastatin treatment .
pharmacokinetics of simvastatin was compared between sd rats treated with an active and control ( fig 8 , s2 table ) .
there was no significant difference in auc0 - 8 or cmax values for either sha or sim between groups treated with the active and the control groups or between positive treatment groups .
this is consistent with a finding by liu et all that a single , co - administered dose of oral berberine did not influence single dose simvastatin pharmacokinetics [ 36 ] .
the shape of the drug concentration - time curves did vary slightly between groups ( fig 8 ) , however there was no statistical difference in auc0 - 9 between treatment ( oral or transdermal ) and the vehicle control ( s2 table ) based upon these results there is no cumulative change in simvastatin bioavailability in animals treated chronically with berberine formulations , suggesting co - administration of these two actives for therapeutic value could be considered however , the results discussed here are preliminary and additional testing is required to investigate this important issue .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0194979.g008 fig 8 comparative pharmacokinetics of sim and sha after 16 days of bbr treatment .
male sprague - dawley rats ( n = 4 / group ) received once daily for 16 days administration of 90 mg / kg of active via bbr oral gavage ( bbr po , designated with green omicron ) , 5 % ( w / w ) bbr transdermal formulation ( bbr td , designated with red omicron ) , 5 % ( w / w ) dhb transdermal formulation ( dhb td ; designated with blue omicron ) , or vehicle control ( vehicle - td , designated with black omicron ) .
on day 16 all animals also received 12 mg / kg simvastatin and serum was collected over the course of eight hours .
concentrations of ( a ) sim and ( b ) sha were quantified .
no statistical difference between groups was observed ( s2 table ) .
error bars represent standard error of the mean .
conclusion multi - analyte quantification in low volumes of rat serum was facilitated by the development of a concurrent and sensitive lc - ms / ms method .
this analytical method was applied to pharmacokinetic experiments comparing oral berberine , transdermal berberine , and transdermal dihydroberberine in both acute and chronic studies .
transdermal dihydroberberine presented increased systemic berberine and dbg compared with other routes of administration in both acute and chronic treatment .
interestingly , a decrease in bioavailability between acute and chronic experiments suggests changes in gastrointestinal handling and hepatic metabolism , with the former overcome through transdermal administration .
while transdermal dihydroberberine unequivocally increased berberine levels in circulation this increase had no effect on liver or kidney function nor altered the expression of hepatic enzymes cyp3a4 and hmg - coa reductase .
furthermore , chronic administration of berberine or dihydroberberine yielded no overt change in simvastatin bioavailability suggesting these two actives may investigated in tandem .
while it remains to be determined if transdermal dihydroberberine could yield improved bioavailability compared its oral equivalent , the opportunity that topical routing presents with avoidance of the gastrointestinal tract and first - pass metabolism is worthy of continued investigation .
in summary , the introduction of berberine by means of its precursor dihydroberberine within the transdermal formulation may prove significantly advantageous and supports further research into this formulations efficacy in models of diabetes or dyslipidemia .

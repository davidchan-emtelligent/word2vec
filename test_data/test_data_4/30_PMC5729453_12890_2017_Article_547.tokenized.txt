background to improve the understanding of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia ( afop ) , we present one case of afop proven by percutaneous lung biopsy along with clinical features , chest imaging and pathology .
case presentation a 50 - year - old man was admitted to our department after he was given empiric therapy for community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) .
the clinical symptoms of the patient were dry cough , chills , night sweats and high fevers .
chest computed tomography ( ct ) scan showed a high - density shadow in the right lung lobe , similar to lobular pneumonia .
the patient was preliminarily diagnosed with community - acquired pneumonia ; however , antibacterial treatment was ineffective .
to confirm the diagnosis , we performed bronchoscopy and percutaneous lung biopsy ; pathology was consistent with afop .
after he was treated with glucocorticoids , the patient 's symptoms were relieved , and the shadow seen on imaging dissipated during the follow - up period .
conclusions afop is a rare histopathological diagnosis that can be easily misdiagnosed .
clinicians need to consider the possibility of afop in the case of invalid antibacterial therapy .
keywords afop pathology ct issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background ever since the concept of afop was proposed by beasley in a pathologic study of 17 patients with acute / subacute lung injury in 2002 [ 1 ] , more and more cases have been published across all age groups .
however , afop has not been included in the clinical category of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( iip ) but has been referred to as a rare pathological type in recent years [ 2 ] .
interestingly , afop symptoms are not typical ; patients commonly present with dyspnoea , cough , fever , etc. , which makes it more difficult to diagnose compared to other diseases [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] .
in addition , the treatment of afop is controversial ; both glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents have been shown to be effective [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] .
to improve the understanding of afop , we herein present one case of a patient with afop proven by pathology , whose clinical symptoms were significantly relieved by glucocorticoid treatment .
case presentation general information a 50 - year - old male farmer , a declared nonsmoker , with history of contact with glyphosate ( a kind of herbicide ) 2 days prior to symptom onset , was admitted to our department with a 20 - day history of dry cough , chills , night sweats and high fevers on october 6 .
he was administered empiric therapy for community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) with piperacillin - tazobactam and treatment was invalid at a local hospital .
physical examination on his admission , vital signs were as follows : temperature , 40 degreesc , oxygen saturation on room air , 95 % .
chest auscultation revealed breath sounds with fine crackles and wheezes increased in the right lung ; no other findings were remarkable .
auxiliary examination the local hospital chest ct ( fig. 1 ) showed patchy opacities and a spot - like high density shadow in the right basement of the lower lobe and the right middle lobe .
the initial bloodwork was as follows : wbc19.2 x 109 / l , n85 % , l8 % .
the procalcitonin level was 1.22 ng / ml , esr was 72 mm / h. the other laboratory tests all were negative , including rapid antigen tests for influenza and hiv ; liver , kidney and coagulation function tests ; arterial blood gas analysis ; autoimmune and tumour biomarkers ; g - test and lipopolysaccharide ; blood , bone marrow and sputum culture ; and detection of herbicide toxicity. fig. 1 the local hospital chest ct ( oct .
01 ) showed patchy opacities and a spot - like high density shadow in the right basement of the lower lobe and the right middle lobe preliminary diagnosis : community - acquired pneumonia .
treatment course on admission , considering drug - resistant pneumonia , the patient was treated empirically with levofloxacin plus imipenem / cilastatin , imipenem / cilastatin plus vancomycin and anti - tuberculosis treatment in succession ; however , symptoms were without remission .
bronchoscopy was conducted , and staining for acid - fast bacillus and fungus was negative in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( balf ) , but the pathology study showed ( fig. 2a ) massive cellulose exudate under the microscope .
chest ct scan ( fig. 3 ) showed no improvement , same as before .
in view of the situation of invalid antibacterial treatment and exclusion of other infection diseases , the patient was administered methylprednisolone 80 mg daily ; the patient 's fever subsided and symptoms improved significantly .
to confirm the diagnosis , we conducted an ultrasound - guided percutaneous needle lung biopsy ; pathology revealed ( fig. 2b ) massive cellulose exudate with organization in the alveolar cavity , alveolar septum widened with oedema and lymphocytes and sparse eosinophilic infiltration .
no necrosis , bleeding or neutrophil infiltration could be seen .
above all , we considered a diagnosis of afop ; the patient was continued on methylprednisolone 80 mg daily without obvious discomfort .
after 5 days , the dose was changed to 40 mg daily .
repeat chest ct scan ( fig. 4 ) revealed the opacity had reduced in size .
after another 3 days , the patient was switched to prednisone 40 mg orally , with a reduction of 5 mg weekly after discharge from our hospital .
during the follow - up period , repeat chest ct scan ( fig. 5 ) showed resolution was achieved and the patient remained asymptomatic. fig. 2 haematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) stain , massive cellulose ( arrow ) exudate with organization in the alveolar spaces , alveolar septum widened with oedema and lymphocytes and sparse eosinophilic infiltration .

22 ) showed the shadow had basically resolved , with a residual fibre cable final diagnosis : acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia ( afop ) .
discussion and conclusions a literature review revealed that fewer than 120 cases have been published ; whether afop can be treated as an independent disease or whether it was a distinct pattern of acute lung injury ( ali ) remained to be elucidated .
to the best of our knowledge , afop diagnosis depends mainly on pathology .
the differential diagnosis includes as follows , organizing pneumonia ( op ) , eosinophil pneumonia ( ep ) , and diffuse alveolar damage ( dad ) [ 5 , 6 ] .
interestingly , afop has distinctive histopathology , characterized by massive cellulose exudate with organization in the alveolar spaces , rather than the fibrous tissue and fibroblast proliferation seen in op ; the numerous eosinophils , macrophage infiltration and eosinophil abscesses formed in ep ; or the hyaline membranes seen in dad [ 5 , 6 ] .
some scholars have suggested afop might be the late pathologic changes of ali , associated with alveolar wall capillary damage and bleeding [ 7 ] .
afop could be idiopathic or could also be associated with other diseases , lung transplantation [ 8 ] , connective tissue disease [ 9 , 10 ] , infection [ 11 , 12 ] , drug reactions [ 13 ] , etc .
for this case , the patient was a general farmer with a history of contact with an herbicide prior to symptom onset .
as a result , could we boldly speculate the pesticide was also an independent risk factor ?
glyphosate is similar to paraquat , which is widely used in china 's rural areas .
as a low - toxicity herbicide , only a few poisoning cases have been reported [ 14 ] .
although glyphosate may not cause pulmonary fibrosis as severe as paraquat , it still might lead to lung injury , including multi - organ damage. of course , our speculation was done to only improve the understanding of afop ; the relevant mechanisms need to be further clarified via experiments .
in conclusion , afop , which is referred to as a rare histopathological type , can easily be misdiagnosed .
clinicians need to take into consideration the possibility of afop in the case of invalid antibacterial therapy .
this case was not novel but of significant clinical importance and very instructive .

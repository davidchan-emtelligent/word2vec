total antigens from leishmania braziliensis promastigotes , solubilized with sodium cholate ( dslp ) , were formulated within ultradeformable nanovesicles ( dslp - ultradeformable archaeosomes , ( dslp - uda ) , and dslp - ultradeformable liposomes ( dslp - udl )) and topically administered to balb / c mice .
ultradeformable nanovesicles can penetrate the intact stratum corneum up to the viable epidermis , with no aid of classical permeation enhancers that can damage the barrier function of the skin .
briefly , 100 nm unilamellar dslp - uda ( soybean phosphatidylcholine : halorubrum tebenquichense total polar lipids ( tpl ) : sodium cholate , 3:3:1 w : w ) of - 31.45 mv z potential , containing 4.84 +/ - 0.53 % w / w protein / lipid dslp , 235 kpa young modulus were prepared .
in vitro , dslp - uda was extensively taken up by j774a1 and bone marrow derive cells , and the only that induced an immediate secretion of il - 6 , il - 12p40 and tnf - alpha , followed by il - 1beta , by j774a1 cells .
such extensive uptake is a key feature of uda ascribed to the highly negatively charged archaeolipids of the tpl , which are recognized by a receptor specialized in uptake and not involved in downstream signaling .
despite dslp alone was also immunostimulatory on j774a1 cells , applied twice a week on consecutive days along 7 weeks on balb / c mice , it raised no measurable response unless associated to udl or uda .
the highest systemic response , igga2 mediated , 1 log lower than im dslp al2o3 , was elicited by dslp - uda .
such findings suggest that in vivo , udl and uda acted as penetration enhancers for dslp , but only dslp - uda , owed to its pronounced uptake by apc , succeeded as topical adjuvants .
the actual tpl composition , fully made of sn2,3 ether linked saturated archaeolipids , gives the uda bilayer resistance against chemical , physical and enzymatic attacks that destroy ordinary phospholipids bilayers .
together , these properties make uda a promising platform for topical drug targeted delivery and vaccination , that may be of help for countries with a deficient healthcare system .

introduction vaccination is considered the best hope for control of all forms of leishmania diseases , and the development of a safe , effective and affordable antileishmanial vaccine is a critical global public - health priority [ 1 ] .
nanovaccination , an approach relying on the higher uptake of nanoparticles compared to that of soluble material by antigen presenting cells ( apc ) , results in enhanced antigen processing , lymphocyte priming and subsequent adaptive immune response .
a growing number of ad - hoc designed nanoparticles is being tested as first ( soluble or nanoparticle associated antigens without immunomodulatory activity ) or second ( nanoparticle associated antigens with immunomodulatory activity ) generation adjuvants [ 2 ] , entering clinical trials and commercialization [ 3 ] .
the nanovaccination approach offers a new portfolio of adjuvants , which may help to overcome the challenges of vaccinating in countries of poor sanitary infrastructure , lacking of trained personnel , cold chain maintenance , proper waste management , syringes sterilization .
probably because of its character of neglected disease , up to the moment no commercial vaccine is available to prevent the muco - cutaneous leishmaniasis ( mcl ) , a highly morbid , inflammatory and disfiguring infection , mostly prevalent in southamerica [ 4 ] .
one of the factors contributing to slow down its development is the important genetic and biological divergence amongst l. major / l. infantum and l. braziliensis [ 5 ] , which demands that polyvalent vaccines include a critical fragment of l. braziliensis antigens [ 6 - 8 ] .
the recombinant antigens leish f1 , is a protein comprised of three fragments conserved across various leishmania species including l. donovani , and l. chagasi , causative agents of new world visceral leishmaniasis , and l. braziliensis [ 9 , 10 ] .
a vaccine in development by the infectious disease research institute ( idri , seattle , wa ) and currently in phase i and ii clinical trials combines leishf1 with the powerful adjuvants mpl - se. the last consists of the tlr4 ligand monophosphoryl lipid a , an attenuated form of lipid a from salmonella minnesota r595 ( gsk ) , in a stable oil - in - water emulsion ( made of squalene , pluronic f68 , glycerol , alpha - tocopherol and phospholipids ) .
squalene emulsions adjuvanted vaccines , although used against life threatening infections , have raised a number of concerns ; are said for instance , to be excellent for priming , but not to boost pre existing immune responses well [ 11 ] , other have been associated with narcolepsy in children and adolescents in northern european countries [ 12 ] .
emulsion adjuvants in general can bring also stability challenges for many antigens , particularly if a single dose liquid vial is preferred [ 13 ] .
whereas the overall risk benefit in prophylactic vaccination against pandemic and prepandemic lethal viral fevers was declared positive by the who [ 14 ] , the use of squalene emulsions to adjuvant vaccines against a disease caused by a non lethal protozoan parasite is at least uncertain .
in this scenario , developing adjuvants different from squalene - containing o / w emulsions for vaccination against protozoan becomes an attractive subject to address .
for instance , an initial study performed in our laboratory using for the first time archaeosomes , nanovesicles made of total polar lipids ( tpl ) from the hyperhalophile archaea halorubrum tebenquichense , to immunize c3h / hen mice against the model antigen bovine serum albumin , showed these archaeosomes recalled antigen specific th1 biased and memory responses [ 15 ] .
later , we found that 3 sc doses of trypanosoma cruzi ( a protozoan trypanosomatide parasite close to leishmania ) total antigens adjuvanted with the same archaeosomes , were sufficient to protect balb c mice from a lethal challenge with trypomastigotes of the tulahuen strain [ 16 ] .
these result encouraged us to test novel adjuvants containing tpl from h. tebenquichense , to elicit protective responses against protozoan parasites by non parenteral route .
topical and mucosal vaccines offer several advantages over injectables : are easier to administer , carry less risk of transmitting infections , and could simplify the manufacture process , thereby facilitating vaccine production and mass deployment [ 17 ] .
because of this , the present proof of concept is aimed to test the immune response by topical nanovaccination on balb / c mice , to proteins extracted from leishmania braziliensis .
to that aim the proteins were loaded within nanovesicles having the same tpl than original archaeosomes , plus an edge activator that decreases the young modulus of the bilayer , named ultradeformable archaeosomes ( uda ) .
more specifically , the uda are ultradeformable nanovesicles made of soybean phosphatidylcholine ( spc ) : sodium cholate ( nachol ) and tpl at 3 : 1 : 3 w : w. the actual tpl composition , fully made of sn 2,3 ether linked saturated archaeolipids , gives the archaeosomes bilayer resistance against chemical , physical and enzymatic attacks that destroy ordinary phospholipids bilayers [ 18 ] .
the same as archaeosomes , uda display higher chemical and colloidal stability than the so called ultradeformable liposomes ( udl , nanovesicles made of spc : nachol 6:1 w : w ) , ( unpublished results ) .
the same as udl , upon topically applied under non occlusive conditions , the uda can penetrate the intact stratum corneum up to the viable epidermis , with no aid of classical permeation enhancers that can damage the barrier function of the skin .
the tpl content of uda is responsible for its much more pronounced capture by phagocytic / immature antigen presenting cells than udl [ 19 ] .
such properties , together with higher physic - chemical and colloidal stability make uda a promising platform for topical drug targeted delivery and adjuvancy , that may be of help for countries with a deficient healthcare system .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report proposing a needle free vaccination strategy against cl from a new world leishmania specie .

leishmania parasites leishmania braziliensis promastigotes ( strain hom / br75 / m2903 ) supplied by dr. fragueiro and dr. luna from instituto nacional de parasitologia dr mario fatala chaben were cultured at 26degreesc in schneider culture medium supplemented with 10 % fcs , 100 u / ml penicillin , 100 mug / ml streptomycin and 2 mm glutamine .
promastigotes were harvested from stationary phase cultures by centrifugation , washed three times with 10 mm tris buffer plus 0.9 % w / v nacl , ph 7.4 ( tris buffer ) and frozen at - 20degreesc prior to use .
bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( bmdcs ) six - month old balb / c mice were used as bone marrow donors .
bmdcs were generated as described previously [ 22 ] .
briefly , after all muscle tissues were removed from the femurs , the bones were washed twice with phosphate - buffer saline ( ph 7.4 ) ( pbs ) and transferred into a fresh dish with rpmi 1640 medium .
both ends of the bones were cut with scissors in the dish .
then the marrow was flushed out using 2 ml of rpmi 1640 with a syringe and 25 - gauge needle .
the tissue was suspended and passed through a 100 mum cell strainer ( bd falcon , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) to remove small pieces of bone and debris .
red cells were lysed with 0.45 m ammonium chloride , and the remaining cells were washed , and suspended at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells / ml in dc - rpmi medium with two additional supplementation of medium containing rmgm - csf in 100 mm petri dishes ( 5 x106 cells / dish ) .
after 9 days of culture , approximately 80 % of the harvested cells expressed mhc class ii and cd11c .
preparation of detergent - solubilized l. braziliensis proteins a whole - cell extract was prepared as described by santos et al. , 2006 .
briefly , stationary phase promastigotes were washed three times in tris buffer ( 5 min centrifuged at 250 g ) disrupted by 10 freeze and thaw cycles , and submitted to probe - type ultrasonication ( sonics vibra cell ) at 50 % amplitude ( 130 watts ) , for 10 min in an ice bath .
the protein concentration in the whole - cell extract was estimated by bradford using ovalbumin as standard [ 23 ] .
to obtain the detergent - solubilized l. braziliensis proteins ( dslp ) , the whole - cell extract of l. braziliensis was incubated with 10 , 5 or 1.25 % w / v nachol for 45 min at 4degreesc ; the resultant dslp was recovered from filtration through 0.45 mum pores nylon filter .
whole - cell extract and dslp were run by electrophoresis in 7.5 - 15 % linear gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gels ( sds - page ) [ 24 ] .
briefly , the samples were mixed with 62.5 mm tris - hcl ph 6.8 ; 2 % w / v sds , 10 % v / v glycerol , 5 % v / v beta - mercaptoethanol and 0.001 % w / v bromophenol blue and heated at 95degreesc for 5 min prior electrophoresis .
proteins were separated at a constant voltage of 100 v , using a running buffer containing 0.025 m tris , 0.192 m glycine ph 8.3 and 0.1 % w / v sds .
the staining was performed with coomassie brilliant blue r - 250 followed by silver staining .
the imagej software ( national institutes of health , bethesda , md ) was used to scan the 63 kda band of the dslp , and to quantify the amount of dslp associated to uda or udl .
to that aim , a plot of the signal of growing amounts of dslp protein vs mass protein ( 5 - 30 mug ) was fitted by linear regression .
then the dslp signal in uda or udl was extrapolated to render the actual protein mass associated to each nanovesicle .
preparation and characterization of nanovesicles preparation empty nanovesicles : ultradeformable archaeosomes ( uda , made of tpl : spc : nachol , 3:3:1 w : w ) , ultradeformable liposomes ( udl , made of spc : nachol , 6:1 w : w ) and conventional liposomes ( l , fully made of spc ) ; and dslp - containing nanovesicles : dslp - containing uda ( dslp - uda ) and dslp - containing udl ( dslp - udl ) , were prepared by the thin film hydration method .
empty nanovesicles : appropriate amounts of spc in chloroform , and tpl and nachol in chloroform : methanol ( 1:1 , v / v ) , were mixed in round bottom flasks .
solvents were rotary evaporated at 40degreesc until elimination , the lipid films were flushed with n2 and hydrated with aqueous phase ( tris - hcl buffer ) up to a final concentration of 43 mg of phospholipids / ml followed by extrusion .
dslp - containing nanovesicles : the lipid films were prepared as detailed above , but hydrated with dslp having nachol at 10 , 5 and 1.25 % w / v in tris - hcl buffer ) up to 43 mg of phospholipids / ml. the resultant suspensions were sonicated ( 45 minutes with a bath - type sonicator 80 w , 40 khz ) and extruded 15 times through three stacked 0.2 - 0.1 - and 0.1 - mum pore size polycarbonate filters using a 100 ml thermobarrel extruder ( northern lipids , vancouver , canada ) .
after extrusion , nanovesicles were submitted to five freeze - thaw cycles between - 70degreesc and 40degreesc .
finally , nanovesicles were separated from free dslp by gel filtration on sephadex g - 75 using the minicolumn centrifugation technique [ 25 ] .
rh - pe - labelled vesicles : rh - pe was dissolved in chloroform and 12.5 nmol was added to the organic solution of lipids ( nearly 2800:1 w : w phospholipids : rh - pe ) ; nanovesicles were prepared as detailed above .
quantification phospholipids were quantified by botcher microassay [ 21 ] .
the dslp proteins associated to uda or udl was quantified as stated in preparation of detergent - solubilized l. braziliensis proteins .
size and z potential size and zeta potential were determined by dynamic light scattering ( dls ) and phase analysis light scattering ( pals ) respectively , using a nanozsizer apparatus ( malvern instruments , malvern , united kingdom ) .
morphology aliquots of nanovesicles were dropped on a standard carbon - coated cooper transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) grid and then air - dried at room temperature overnight .
tem images were obtained with a jem 1011 ( jeol , new york , ny ) electron microscope at 80 kv. aliquots of nanovesicles diluted in tris buffer with 10 mm cacl2 were dropped on mica as the substrate .
vesicles were stood for 15 min to be washed with 1 ml of milli - q water .
atomic force microscopy ( afm ) images were obtained with a multimode scanning probe microscope ( veeco , santa barbara , ca ) equipped with a nanoscope v controller operating in tapping mode at room temperature .
deformability the nanovesicles deformability ( d ) was calculated according to van den bergh [ 26 ] , having d = j ( rv / rp ) 2 , where j is the rate of penetration through a permeability barrier , rv is the size of nanovesicles after extrusion , and rp is the pore size of the barrier .
to measure j , nanovesicles were extruded through two stacked 50 nm ( rp ) membranes at 0.8 mpa using a thermobarrel extruder .
extruded volume was collected along 15 min , each fraction was quantified for phospholipids , and j calculated as the area under the curve of the plot of recovered phospholipids as a function of time .
the average vesicle diameter after extrusion ( rv ) was measured by dls .
young modulus determination through atomic force microscopy ( afm ) sample preparation and force curves acquisition the mechanical properties of conventional , non ultradeformable ( spc ) , empty ( uda , udl ) and dslp nanovesicles were determined as described by arnal et al .
2012 [ 27 ] .
all the measurements were done using a multimode scanning probe microscope ( veeco , santa barbara , ca ) equipped with a nanoscope v controller .
the nanovesicles were electrostatically immobilized onto polyethyleneimine ( 0.1 % w / v ) pre - incubated glass slides and immediately mounted in the afm liquid chamber .
fifty microliters of pbs were added to the chamber in order to maintain the samples hydrated during the course of the experiments .
the measurements were done using contact sharpened silicon nitride probes ( np - 10 , veeco ) with a nominal tip radius between 20 - 60 nm. the cantilever spring constant ( kc ) was determined for every probe before starting the measurements using the thermal tune method and flat muscovite mica ( spi v - 1 grade ) as a flat rigid surface for photodetector sensitivity calibration , the experimental kc values were between 0.08 and 0.13 n / m. to acquire the force vs. distances curves on the surface of nanovesicles the force volume ( fv ) tool with a routine of 32 x 32 force curves at a scan rate of 1hz was used .
note that different scan rates within 0.1 and 2 produced similar results .
a limit in the highest applied force ( 10 nn ) was established in order not to damage the samples during the fv acquisition .
force curves analysis and young modulus determination the nanoindentation analysis was done using in house developed software [ 27 ] following previously described procedures [ 28 - 30 ] .
first we determined the contact point of the force curves ; which was done manually by determining the exact point were the curves begin to lift from the noncontact baseline .
then the approximation segment of the force vs. distance curves were transformed into force vs. indentation curves by subtracting at constant loading force the z - displacement measured in a vesicle and the respective z - displacement measured on a hard surface ( clean flat mica ) .
all the resulting force vs. indentation curves showed a non - linear behaviour at low force , which were fitted using a hertz model to determine the young modulus .
the selected hertz model was the one that considers a conical tip shape since it was the model that bests fitted our experimental data .
the equation for the hertz model [ 31 , 32 ] is the following : f = 2e tanalpha delta2 / pi ( 1 - nu2 ) ; where f is force , e is the young modulus , alpha is the half opening angle of the conical indenter ( 53degrees ; based in geometrical characteristics of the tip and scanning electron microscopy observations ) , delta is the indentation and nu is the poisson radius which for soft biological samples is assumed to be 0.5 [ 33 , 34 ] .

results characterization of nanovesicles containing detergent - solubilized leishmania proteins both the whole - cell extract of leishmania promastigotes and its supernatant have been indistinctly used as antigenic material in in vitro tests and as pre - clinical and clinical vaccine candidates [ 35 - 37 ] .
besides , it has been observed that detergent - solubilized proteins of a crude extract of l. amazonensis amastigotes reconstituted in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine : dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine : cholesterol nanovesicles , produce protein specific antibodies and partially protects balb / c mice to infection with l. amazonensis promastigotes [ 38 ] .
moreover , the centrifugation pellet of the whole - cell extract from l. amazonensis and l. braziliensis promastigotes was reported to be more antigenic than the supernatant [ 37 ] .
formulating voluminous antigens higher than small model proteins within ud nanovesicles however , proved complex .
for instance , attempts to solubilize the lipid film with whole - cell extract - containing buffer ( or its centrifugation pellet ) led to macroscopic precipitate ( data not shown ) .
to overcome such drawback , the whole cell extract was solubilized as smaller mixed micelles , which could be fully suspended in aqueous media , making feasible their trapping within the inner space of nanovesicles .
the whole - cell extract of leishmania promastigotes can be solubilized employing different hydrophilic / hydrophobic balance and critical micellar concentration ( cmc ) detergents , such as sodium deoxycholate , nachol , sodium dodecylsulphate or octylglucopiranoside [ 38 - 41 ] .
we chose nachol because it forms part of udl and uda bilayers as the edge activator and because of its non denaturing character .
the cmc of nachol is 0.6 - 0.7 % w / v ; above that limit , micelles of 14 nm size are formed ; at 1 % w / v , nachol is known to solubilize more than 90 % axonal membrane proteins of bovine brain [ 42 ] .
we found that 1.25 % w / v nachol solubilized the whole - cell extract as 25 nm mixed micelles ( dslp ) of 4.8 mg / ml proteins and 3.3 mg / ml phosphate .
the sds - page of the whole - cell extract and of dslp showed a similar band pattern ( fig 1a and 1b ) ( meaning that most of the proteins were solubilized within mixed micelles ) , dominated by a highly intense 63 kda band accompanied by heavy proteins and less intense lighter bands .
the 63 kda band could correspond to the gp65 promastigote surface glycoprotein , already described in several species of leishmania [ 43 , 44 ] .
since the presence of nachol interferes with protein colorimeric methods , the densitometric intensity of the 63 kda band was used to estimate the minimal protein content in dslp and in nanovesicles .
structural properties of empty and dslp - loaded nanonanovesicles are shown in table 2 .

dslp - uda and dslp - udl resulted to be ~ 100 nm diameter nanovesicles , the same size order of uda and udl .
the potential structural destabilization on nanovesicles induced by dslp , was assessed by determining their size by dls after 24 h ; the presence of unilamellar nanovesicles was further confirmed by tem ( fig 2a and 2c ) and by afm ( fig 2b and 2d ). by dls , the occurrence of heterogeneous populations having 15 - 25 nm diameter micelles growing at expenses of higher sized nanovesicles in particular for dslp - uda , was revealed .
the size heterogeneity of nanovesicles was less pronounced for films suspended with dslp 1.25 % w / v nachol ( fig 1d ) ; for that reason , dslp - nanovesicles were prepared with dslp 1.25 % w / v nachol. by afm the dslp - uda - despite of its high z potential - , appeared as aggregated nanovesicles , probably because of ionic bridging with cacl2 employed to fix the nanovesicles to the mica substrate .

the calculated d of dslp - nanovesicles was reduced nearly 3.5 folds as compared to empty nanovesicles , and nearly four folds above that of conventional non ultradeformable nanovesicles ( table 2 ) .
young modulus determination through afm the young 's modulus ( e ) or longitudinal elastic modulus is the ratio between the increased tension applied by traction ( in the zone of elastic behavior of the material ) ( dsigma ) and the resultant increased relative deformation ( depsilon ) ( e : dsigma / depsilon ) .
e is a measure of a material rigidity : the higher the elastic modulus is the more rigid material .
afm is a growingly used technique to acquire soft matter images , such as molecular crystals , proteins and live cells [ 45 ] .
afm is a well - suited technique for studying structural features of nanovesicles enabling the simultaneous nanoscale analysis of shape and mechanical properties of the bilayers .
it allows picking up surface topographical images with a space resolution close to 1 a and force vs. distance curves with a detection limit close to 10 - 12 n. our results showed in first place that e values for conventional nanovesicles are coincident with bibliographic data ( 1.97 +/ - 0.75 x 106 pa for adsorbed eggpc nanovesicles [ 46 ] .
the young 's modulus for udl and uda were between 3 and 4 folds lower than that of conventional nanovesicles .
the difference was coincident with the higher d of uda and udl as compared to conventional non ultradeformable nanovesicles determined by the van der berg method .
the young 's module for dslp - nanovesicles was in the order of the corresponding to empty ultradeformable nanovesicles ( table 2 ) .

dslp alone , at 50 mug / ml induced an early onset of il - 12p40 followed by high level of il - 6 ; no tnf - alpha or il - 1 beta induction was registered .
dslp - uda however , was the only to induce an early onset of il - 6 , il - 12p40 and tnf - alpha , followed 34 h later by high il - 1 beta titers .

immunization the humoral immune response generated after topical weekly applications of dslp - nanovesicles was compared to that generated after topical dslp and by i.m. alum adsorbed dslp , as a positive control of dslp immunogenicity .
the titers rose by topical dslp - uda were 1 log higher than those of dslp - udl .
the response remained constant up to the day 49 , while that of dslp - udl faded rapidly within 3 weeks ( fig 6a ) .
the topical application of dslp did not raise measurable igg titers .
none of the topical administrations induced iga titers in salivary washes .
in mice , igg2a produced from th1 cells indicates cell - mediated immunity , and igg1 produced from th2 cells indicates humoral immunity .
therefore , the balance between th1 and th2 cells ( th1 / th2 ratio ) can be represented as the igg2a / igg1 ratio .
the isotype analysis of samples taken the 49 day showed that i.m alum adsorbed dslp raised a mixed isotype profile with igg1 / igg2a ~ 1 .
in contrast , dslp - uda induced preferentially the igg2a isotype , suggesting a th1 polarized response ( fig 6b ) .

discussion the success of needle free vaccination largely depends on counting on carriers ultradeformable enough to efficiently penetrate the intact stratum corneum to bring their payload across the skin .
in a previous work , we found that uda carrying ovalbumin ( ova , a 42.7 kda , 6 nm diameter globular protein ) ( ova - uda ) raised an igg2a - biased anti - ova systemic response ten folds higher than ova - udl , after topical application on balb / c mice [ 19 ] .
the immune response to topical stimulus was enabled by the ultradeformable nanovesicles delivering ova across and beyond the stratum corneum , presumably through the lipid canyons that separate keratinocyte clusters of the skin upper layers [[ 47 ] .
such canyons occasionally extend down to depths comparable to that of the dermal - epidermal junction below the flat surface regions in porcine and human skin [ 48 , 49 ]. upon topical non - occlusive application , the fluorescence of alexa fluor 647 labeled ova within udl or uda , allows to indirectly estimate a rough canyons thickness of 50 - 100 mum [ 50 ] .
this is in good agreement with the 10 - 25 mum width canyons separating keratinocyte clusters of 100 - 250 mum diameter , recently assessed by stimulated raman scattering microscopy [[ 50 ] .
canyons , despite of being wide enough so as to allow the passage of 100 nm diameter nanovesicles , are filled with lipids enclosing water nanochannels , that nanovesicles are thought to penetrate [ 51 ] .
however , these extremely thin pathways [ 48 , 52 ] .
scarcely distributed across the canyons , together with the impaired material diffusion through the lipid filling organized in orthorhombic lateral packing lamellas [ 53 ] , and the intercellular unions ( corneo - desmosomes in stratum corneum , tight junctions in upper viable epidermis ) [ 54 ] , may constitute a physical constraint to the penetration of bulky structures carried by udl or uda [ 49 ] ( fig 7 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0150185.g007 fig 7 scheme depicting the main structural sections of the skin : stratum corneum ( sc ) , viable epidermis and dermis , and barriers to permeation - penetration ( not a scale ) : the diffusive pathway across the lipids of the sc is mediated by disordered bilayers , represented by the x - ray diffraction pattern corresponding to the lateral packing in liquid phase of bilayers shown in a ) ( distance between planes ~ 0.46 nm ) .
bilayers b ) and c ) with more organized lateral packing ( distance between planes 0.41 and 0.41 - 0.37 nm , respectively ) , not involved in diffusion across the skin .
the interaction between ultradeformable nanovesicles ( udn ) , conventional liposomes , hydrophilic solutes and lipids at the sc surface is also represented .
ultradeformable nanovesicles and hydrophilic solutes penetrate across hydrophilic leads in the canyons in - between corneocyte clusters .
a scheme of ultradeformable nanovesicles and associated cargo crossing an hydrophilic channel in the sc. the colloidal structure is lost below the surface .
the associated cargo penetrates along with the lipid bilayers .
no endocytic uptake occurs at i and ii levels since the sc is made of dead corneocytes .
below 10 mum depth , endocytic uptake of material penetrating across hydrophilic channels accessing the viable epidermis may occur .
epidermis : stratum basale ( sb ) , stratum spinosum ( ss ) , stratum granulosum ( sg ) .
( dermo epidermal basal membrane is represented as black line and the reticular capillary plexus in the dermis as red dots ) an interesting example is constituted by aqueous suspension of quantum dots ( qdots , pegylated cdse / zns core / shell 12 nm x 6 nm ellipsoidal bulky stiff nanoparticles ) , that upon topical application do penetrate the skin up to the viable epidermis .
when loaded within ultradeformable nanovesicles however , the qdots remain stacked at the first layers of the stratum corneum and do not penetrate [ 55 ] .
such observation challenges the notion of needing ultradeformable nanovesicles to grant the penetration of particulate cargo .
it suggests also that factors such as size , shape and even stiffness of particulate cargo may account for its penetration , beyond the simple association to ultradeformable nanovesicles ( fig 7 ) .
according to this view , the dslp used in this work , of size in the range of a qd ( nearly 3 folds higher than ovalbumin ) , were good candidates to stack on the first stratum corneum layers despite of loaded within ultradeformable nanovesicles .
indeed , such phenomenon was suspected while estimating bilayer deformability at the first steps of dslp - nanovesicles structural characterization .
when the deformability ( d , a parameter inversely proportional to the young modulus ( e )) of dslp - nanovesicles was measured by the van der bergh method , we found it lower than that of empty ones .
on the contrary , the deformability of dslp - nanovesicles determined by afm was similar to that of empty ones .
this apparent discrepancy would obey to a stacking of the oversized (~ 25 nm ) dslp mixed micelles during extrusion , which caused a reduced phospholipid flux .
the calculated d would result from a steric hindrance caused by packing constraints of cargo and not from reduced bilayer deformability .
since the second method measures the cantilever deflection on surface patches of individual nanovesicles , the afm is thus a more realistic determination of nanovesicles deformability carrying oversized cargoes .
as indicated above , the physical constraint imposed by dslp to nanovesicles extruded across 50 nm filter pores , suggested that in vivo the dslp - ultradeformable nanovesicles could end up stacked within the stratum corneum the same as qd - udl , thus spoiling the topical immunization .
in our experimental setting however , after dropping a weekly dosage of dslp - nanovesicles on the intact skin of balb / c mice , dslp and dslp - udl failed at inducing systemic igg titers , but dslp - uda was the only topical formulation that successfully raised a sustained systemic antigen specific response .
despite of its low protein / lipid ratio ( 3.5 % vs 12.5 % for ova - uda ) , dslp - uda induced 1 log lower serum titers than i.m. dslp - alum adsorbed , but was tenfold more immunogenic than ova - uda ( that rendered 2 log lower serum titers than i.m. ova - alum adsorbed [ 19 ]) .
topical dslp - uda induced igg2a only ( which in mice suggests a th1 biased response , as required for vaccination against leishmania ) [ 6 ] , whereas the response to i.m. dslp alum - adsorbed was a mixed igg isotype .
as previously determined in [ 56 ]. , j774a1 macrophages capture empty uda much more extensively than udl .
uda in other words is a more efficient carrier for material delivery to phagocytic cells than udl .
here uda and udl showed to be were non immunogenic , since no pro inflammatory cytokines were detected in macrophages supernatants ; instead , macrophages responded only to dslp and dslp - nanovesicles .
the immune responses to dslp - udl , however were of low intensity and faded soon .
dslp - uda was the only capable of inducing an immediate secretion of il - 6 , il - 12p40 and tnf - alpha , followed by high tnf - alpha and il - 1beta titers in j774a1 cells .
the response was aroused with lower amounts of proteins ( 28 mug / ml dslp as dslp - uda vs 50 mug / ml dslp alone ) , suggesting that uda may enhance the immunogenicity of dslp .
in particular , tnf - alpha level raised by dslp - uda was not only higher than the induced by dslp alone , but also by the classical tlr4 ligand lps ( the source of the potent mpla , a well - known immunostimulatory adjuvant present in commercial emulsions such as as04 ) .
interestingly , dslp - uda was the only stimulus that induced a remarkable elevation of il - 1beta .
similar to tnf - alpha , il - 1beta is a major pro - inflammatory cytokine considered as an alarm signal secreted by macrophages .
il - 1beta initiates and propagates inflammation by inducing the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and leukocytes [ 57 , 58 ] .
this cytokine was reported to be involved in a protective immune response against leishmania spp. il - 1beta affects the pathogenicity of leishmania by generating an inflammatory response in afflicted tissues and by modulating adaptive t cell mediated immune responses , which act to limit parasite dissemination [ 59 , 60 ] .
substantive experimental evidence suggests that the myd88 - dependent toll - like receptor ( tlr ) signalling , a classical recognition pathway for macrophage activation , is bypassed by the immunologically silent leishmania spp .
[ 61 - 66 ] .
instead , il - 1beta has recently been described as initiator of the protective immune response .
in particular , the nlrp3 ( a member of the nod - like receptor ( nlr ) family that senses microbes and cell damage ) mediated activation of the inflammasome and subsequent induction of il - 1beta signalling , was found to play a key role in host resistance to mcl [ 67 ] .
the inflammasome are multimeric complexes of proteins , assembled in the host cell cytoplasm in response to specific stress signals or contamination of the cytoplasm by microbial molecules .
the canonical inflammasomes are composed of at least three main components : an inflammatory caspase ( caspase - 1 , caspase - 11 ) , an adapter molecule ( such as asc ) , and a sensor protein ( such as the nlr family members nlrp1 , nlrp3 , nlrp12 ; also naip1 , naip2 , naip5 , or aim2 [ 68 , 69 ] .
once activated , caspase - 1 induces processing and secretion of il - 1beta , which is transcriptionally regulated when microbial components are sensed by pattern recognition receptors [ 70 ] .
notably , the activation of the inflammasome leads to autonomous macrophage mechanisms that culminate with the restriction of intracellular parasite replication .
these processes involve the regulation of ifn - gamma and processing of il - 1beta , which facilitates the expression of nos2 , an enzyme that is required for no - mediated restriction of leishmania replication in macrophages [ 71 - 73 ] .
the fact that il - 1beta signalling is crucial for the determination of the severity of disease in humans , underscores an important role for the inflammasome - dependent restriction of leishmania spp. replication [ 74 , 75 ] .
unpublished research from our laboratory [ 76 ] suggests that one or more archaeolipids present in the total polar lipids of uda - presumably the main component pgp me - are ligand of the scavenger receptor class a i / ii ( srai / ii ) .
the srai / ii is a pattern recognition receptor mainly expressed by macrophages , vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells , primarily involved in endocytic uptake of particulate material ( lysosomal enzymes , oxidised acetylated lipoproteins , lps , bacteria ) [ 77 ] .
since uda is pronouncedly captured by macrophages upon srai / ii recognition , the amount of dslp antigens available to interact with nlrp3 - a cytoplasmic receptor - would be higher if delivered as dslp - uda , than as dslp alone or dslp - udl .
this may account for the increase of il - 1beta induced on j774a1 cells by dslp - uda .
on the other hand , the expression of sr a by bmcd is highly dependent on the isolation protocol employed [ 78 , 79 ] .
bmdc were also reported to display nlrp3 mediated inflammasome activation in front to several stimuli [ 80 , 81 ] .
if well the expression of sra was not screened here , the bmdc have the potential to react similar to macrophages in front to uda / dslp - uda .
an extensive uptake of uda however , was the only response recorded by bmdc .
less likely , a concomitant production of pro inflammatory cytokines to dslp - uda may have occurred in a temporal pattern different to that recorded at 14 or 48 h. these findings suggest the cells involved in an in vitro primary response to dslp - uda were the macrophages .
in vivo , the proteins in dslp alone were reported to induce il - 12 cytokines [ 49 ] .
overall , this first approach showed that the topical balb / c mice immunization with dslp - uda generated a th1 biased response , as determined by the serum isotypes of dslp - specific igg .
further insights are needed to find out if the high uda - mediated dslp delivery that led to macrophages secretion of il - 1beta , may contribute to an in vivo lethal response to leishmania parasites .

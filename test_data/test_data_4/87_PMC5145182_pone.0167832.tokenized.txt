background epidemiologic data linking metabolic markers - such as insulin , insulin - like growth factors ( igfs ) - and adipose tissue - derived factors with cancer are inconsistent. between - study differences in blood collection protocols , in particular participant 's fasting status , may influence measurements .
methods we investigated the impact of fasting status and blood sample processing time on components of the insulin / igf axis and in adipokines in a controlled feeding study of 45 healthy postmenopausal - women aged 50 - 75 years .
fasting blood samples were drawn ( t0 ) , after which subjects ate a standardized breakfast ; subsequent blood draws were made at 1 hour ( t1 ) , 3 hours ( t3 ) , and 6 hours ( t6 ) after breakfast .
serum samples were assayed for insulin , c - peptide , total - and free - igf - i , igf - binding protein [ bp ] - 1 and - 3 , total and high molecular weight ( hmw ) - adiponectin , retinol binding protein - 4 , plasminogen activator inhibitor ( pai ) - 1 , and resistin .
results insulin and c - peptide levels followed similar postprandial trajectories ; intra - class correlation coefficients [ icc ] for insulin = 0.75 , ( 95 % ci : 0.64 - 0.97 ) and c - peptide ( icc = 0.66 , 95 % ci : 0.54 - 0.77 ) were similarly correlated in fasting ( spearman correlation , r = 0.78 , 95 % ci : 0.64 - 0.88 ) and postprandial states ( t1 , r = 0.77 ( 95 % ci : 0.62 - 0.87 ) ; t3,r = 0.78 ( 95 % ci : 0.63 - 0.87 ) ; t6,r = 0.77 ( 95 % ci : 0.61 - 0.87 )) .
free - igf - i and igfbp - 1 levels were also affected by fasting status , whereas total - igf - i and igfbp - 3 levels remained unchanged .
levels of adipokines were largely insensitive to fasting status and blood sample processing delays .
conclusion several components of the insulin / igf axis were significantly impacted by fasting state and in particular , c - peptide levels were substantially altered postprandially and in a similar manner to insulin .
the study population were recruited at the center for clinical and translational science ( ccts ) at the rockefeller university hospital ( new york , ny ) using funds grant # 8 ul1 tr000043 .
supported in part by grant # ul1rr024143 from the national center for advancing translational sciences ( ncats ) , national institutes of health .
the funds for the measurement of adipokines were obtained from the national cancer institute ( r03ca143956 - 01 ) .

introduction obesity , type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) and metabolic syndrome are significant risk factors for cancers at multiple sites including postmenopausal breast , colorectum , endometrium , liver , kidney and pancreas [ 1 - 3 ] .
a growing number of epidemiological studies have investigated the biological pathways which may link obesity , t2d , and cancer risk .
insulin / insulin - growth factor - 1 ( igf - 1 ) axis markers and abnormal levels of adipokines have been implicated as underlying , in part , the obesity - cancer relationship .
however , for common malignancies , such as postmenopausal breast cancer and colorectal cancer , there are inconsistencies in the literature and some prospective investigations have reported conflicting findings [ 4 - 9 ] .
for example , in an analysis conducted within the women 's health initiative observational study , higher fasting insulin levels were associated with greater breast cancer risk [ 4 ] , however , other studies which measured c - peptide levels as a marker of insulin secretion , often in non - fasting bloods , have generally reported null relationships [ 5,6 ] .
as a further example , adiponectin , an insulin - sensitizing adipokine which has anti - inflammatory activities , has been inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in some [ 7,8 ] , but not all [ 9 ] , prospective investigations .
a possible contributory factor to the observed heterogeneous results across studies is between - study differences in blood collection protocols .
for instance , it is unclear how the time interval between last meal and blood draw ( i.e. , fasting status ) affects measurement of various metabolic parameters such as the insulin / igf axis and adipokines .
in addition , it is unknown how the separation of serum from whole blood ( i.e. processing time ) influences measured adipokines levels .
the effects of blood specimen processing time on measured levels of igf axis markers has previously been investigated and showed , for example , that total igf - i and igfbp - 3 levels were unaffected by variation in sample processing while free igf - i levels changed significantly [ 10 ] .
to investigate how circulating levels of insulin / igf axis components and adipokine levels change in response to the transition from fasting to non - fasting state and sample processing , we conducted a controlled feeding study in postmenopausal women with sequential blood draws and measured levels of insulin , c - peptide , total igf - i , free igf - i , igf - binding protein - 1 ( igfbp - 1 ) , and igf - binding protein - 3 ( igfbp - 3 ) , as well as levels of adipokines , including , total and high molecular weight ( hmw ) adiponectin , retinol binding protein - 4 ( rbp - 4 ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( pai - 1 ) , and resistin .
understanding the role of fasting status and blood sample processing time , using a study design that is modeled after a typical epidemiologic study conducted among healthy women , could inform the design , analysis , and interpretation of epidemiologic studies of these obesity - related serological markers .
materials and methods study subjects study subjects were 45 postmenopausal women aged 50 - 75 years old who were recruited via advertisements directed to the existing rockefeller university healthy volunteer database , the rockefeller university campus , local medical centers , and senior centers .
criteria for inclusion in the study were : no use of tobacco products in the previous 6 months ; non - users of exogenous hormones in the previous 6 months , including hormone replacement therapy ( hrt ) ; and , not taking thyroid medication at the time of blood draw .
in addition , women with diabetes , thyroid conditions , and glucose levels above 180 mg / dl at the screening visit were not eligible for inclusion .
study participants were recruited at the center for clinical and translational science ( ccts ) at the rockefeller university hospital ( new york , ny ) .
women who completed the study intervention received 200 usd in compensation .
the institutional review board at rockefeller university reviewed and approved all phases of the study .
study intervention subjects arrived at the study center at 8:00am (+/ - 30 minutes ) and had fasted overnight ( for at least 8 hours ) .
blood was drawn at four time intervals .
the first blood draw ( t0 ) - based on an overnight fast - - included 3x10ml red - top tubes ( with clot activator for serum separation ) of blood and a glucose finger stick test .
a research breakfast was then given to the subjects and was expected to be consumed entirely within 20 minutes .
the total calories of the breakfast were adjusted to 1 / 3 of the subject 's estimated daily energy needs for weight maintenance ( based on the harris - benedict equation for resting energy expenditure ) .
the meal mimicked the composition of an average u.s. diet ( i.e. , 15 % protein , 32 - 33 % fat and 52 - 53 % carbohydrate ) .
as an example , a subject requiring 2,100 calories per day for weight maintenance was served a metabolic breakfast meal with 700 calories , and contained ( 1 / 2 ) cup orange juice , 1 ( 1 / 2 ) oz cornflakes , ( 1 / 2 ) cup whole milk , ( 1 / 2 ) cup light yogurt , and ( 1 / 2 ) oz chopped walnuts .
lactose - free milk was substituted for regular milk for one subject who was lactose - intolerant .
after the breakfast was consumed , postprandial blood samples were drawn 1 hour after completion of the meal ( t1 ) and again at hour 3 ( t3 ) and hour 6 ( t6 ) .
for the t1 and t3 blood draws , 3x10ml red - top tubes of blood ( with clot activator for serum separation ) were collected , while 6x10ml red - top tubes of blood ( with clot activator for serum separation ) were collected for t6. between the research breakfast and the three postprandial blood draws , the study subjects were under observation by study nurses and were able to walk around the study center and use its recreational facilities ( e.g. , computers and tvs / dvds ) .
during this period , subjects were prohibited from certain activities ( e.g. , heavy lifting and running ) and from consuming any foods ( with the exception of water ) until after the last blood draw ( t6 ) .
blood processing following blood draw , the blood specimens were immediately stored on ice .
within 30 minutes of the t0 , t1 , and t3 draws , the tubes were centrifuged .
serum was then aliquoted and stored at - 80degreesc .
the 6x10ml red - top tubes from the t6 draw were processed in sets of two .
the first set was processed immediately ( t6p0 ) .
the two remaining sets were stored at 4degreesc for 24 hours ( t6p24 ) and 48 hours ( t6p48 ) before processing .
laboratory assays serum samples were assayed for insulin and c - peptide by ria ( linco products , now known as emd millipore ) .
serum levels of free igf - 1 were quantified by ria ( diagnostic systems laboratory ) , while levels of total igf - 1 , igfbp - 1 , and igfbp - 3 were quantified by elisa ( alpco diagnostics ) .
serum samples were assayed in duplicate for adipokines , including total and hmw adiponectin , rbp - 4 , pai - 1 , and resistin , in dr. michael pollak 's laboratory using commercially - available elisa - based assays for each adipokine ( emd millipore ) .
in addition to the 270 study samples ( 45 women x 6 samples / woman at t0 , t1 , t3 , t6p0 , t6p24 , and t6p48 ) , 20 blinded quality control ( qc ) samples were included .
the qc samples were plated so that there were 2 sets of replicates in each batch to estimate within and between batch variations .
for all of the insulin / igf axis and adipokines measurements , except resistin , inter - and intra - batch cvs were < 10 % .
for resistin , the intra - batch cv was 1.6 % and the inter - batch was 21.4 % .
statistical analysis changes in serological measurements from the fasting ( t0 ) level for each serological factor were evaluated at each postprandial blood draw ( t1 , t3 , and t6 ) , separately .
several of the serological markers had skewed distributions ( total adiponectin , hmw adiponectin , total igf - i , igfbp - 3 , igfbp - 1 , and resistin ) .
the medians and median absolute deviations ( mad ) for each biomarker were plotted for each time period .
intraclass correlation coefficients ( icc ) , defined as the ratio of between - subject variance to total variance , were calculated as a measure of the reproducibility of each serological factor over time within subjects .
we conducted analyses for all women combined , and by body mass index ( bmi ) strata ( normal weight 18.5 - < 25 kg / m2 ; overweight 25 - < 30 kg / m2 ; and obese >= 30 kg / m2 ) .
results in this population of postmenopausal women , the median age among subjects was 62 years ( interquartile range [ iqr ] : 57 - 66 years ) ( table 1 ) .
the median bmi of the 45 subjects was 26.6 kg / m2 ( iqr : 23.9 - 31.1 kg / m2 ) .

levels of pai - 1 decreased with greater time since last meal ( fig 2 ; table 3 ) ; however , the icc across the four t0 - t6 time points was 0.88 ( 95 % ci : 0.82 - 0.92 ) , and levels were insensitive to the 24 hours and 48 delays in blood sample processing ( data not shown ) .
these adipokines results were similar for normal weight , overweight , and obese women ( data not shown ) .
discussion in a controlled feeding study of 45 healthy postmenopausal women , we explored the impact of change in fasting status and sample processing time on serum levels of insulin / igf axis components and adipokines .
our results suggest that insulin and c - peptide levels are similarly correlated in fasting and postprandial states and follow very similar trajectories following a meal .
free igf - i and igfbp - 1 levels were also affected by fasting status while total igf - i and igfbp - 3 levels remained stable .
adipokines levels were largely insensitive to fasting status and delays in blood sample processing .
our results suggest that in epidemiological studies which collect blood specimens in the non - fasting state , failure to control for time since last meal ( e.g. adopting a case - control study design and matching by time since last meal ) could have substantial impact on observed associations between insulin , c - peptide , free igf - i , and igfbp - 1 with disease outcomes .
the measurement of c - peptide as a marker of insulin secretion , rather than insulin itself , has been preferred in many epidemiological studies [ 5,11,12 ] .
this is mainly because c - peptide and insulin are co - secreted in equimolar concentrations , and c - peptide has a slower metabolic clearance rate than insulin and as such , may be less sensitive to changes in fasting status [ 13 ] .
however , in our analysis , c - peptide and insulin followed near - identical postprandial increases in concentrations before reducing to fasting levels 6 hours after food intake .
this suggests that c - peptide is not necessarily a more stable marker of insulin levels in the non - fasting state .
indeed , similar spearman correlations ( r = 0.77 to 0.78 ) were found between c - peptide and insulin levels for the fasting ( t0 ) and postprandial ( t1 , t3 , and t6 ) measurements .
overall , our data highlight the importance of fasting blood samples being used to measure both insulin markers and that c - peptide should not necessarily be considered as a superior or more stable indicator of insulin secretion for future epidemiological investigations in healthy postmenopausal women .
insulin is a major regulator of igfbp - 1 , acting to reduce its expression [ 14,15 ] , hence the decline in igfbp - 1 levels we observed in the immediate postprandial phases were likely a consequence of this regulatory mechanism .
such postprandial declines in igfbp - 1 levels would also lead to the increased availability of free - igf - 1 , explaining the immediate postprandial increases in free - igf - 1 levels observed in this study .
previous controlled feeding studies for adipokines have usually focused on the postprandial effects of extreme diets or in subjects with endocrine disorders [ 16,17 ] .
our study design was modelled after a typical epidemiological investigation conducted among healthy postmenopausal women , and our results can therefore be informative for the design and interpretation of cohort studies where blood specimens are collected prior to disease diagnosis .
our results demonstrated that adiponectin , hmw adiponectin , resistin , and rbp - 4 are very stable biomarkers that seem unaffected by fasting status , findings generally consistent with previous controlled feeding studies [ 17 - 20 ] .
for pai - i , and in line with previous studies , levels progressively decreased postprandially [ 21,22 ] , which suggests that epidemiological study participants should ideally have fasted for at least 6 hours when measuring pai - i. to our knowledge , this was the first investigation on the impact of blood sample processing on adipokines levels , and our results indicate that these metabolic biomarkers can be reliably measured regardless of sample processing delay allowing flexibility to blood sample processing protocols of future studies measuring adipokines .
limitations of our study include possible lack of generalizability of the results to populations beyond healthy postmenopausal women .
in addition , it is possible that certain dietary meal compositions may stimulate different post - prandial effects .
further , it is possible other unmeasured factors contributed to variability in the serologic factors assayed in this analysis .
for example circadian or biorhythms may vary between individuals and could have impacted levels of the metabolic markers as well as their postprandial trends [ 23 ] .
finally , use of the harris - benedict equation to determine basal metabolic rate may have resulted in the under - estimation of the calorie requirements for overweight and obese women ; however , we do not believe this would have influenced our findings as our results were consistent across all body sizes .
in summary , the results of this controlled feeding study suggest that the measurements of c - peptide and insulin are equivalent in both fasting and postprandial states , and that adipokines levels are generally insensitive to fasting status and delays in blood sample processing .
future epidemiological studies which measure insulin markers should be conducted in fasting study subjects only or be finely controlled for time since last meal ( e.g. use of a matched case - control study design by fasting time ) .

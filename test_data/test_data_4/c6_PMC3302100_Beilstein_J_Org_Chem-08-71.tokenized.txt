compound 3 is obtained in five steps with an excellent yield of 76 % in the key step .
compared to that , the respective steps of the syntheses of 1 and 2 result in lower yields .
all compounds adopt a double bladed propeller conformation in solution .
compound 3 is considerably more electron deficient than previously reported hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialenes , with reduction potentials of - 0.06 and - 0.45 v in ch2cl2 .
the compounds mostly display red fluorescence with large stokes shifts .
anion - pi interactions cross - conjugated compounds electron deficient compounds fluorescence radialenes introduction cross - conjugated compounds are those which " contain three unsaturated groups , two of which though conjugated to a third unsaturated centre are not conjugated to each other " [ 1 - 2 ] .
such compounds display interesting physical properties and chemical reactivity [ 1 - 2 ] .
the parent dendralenes are acyclic cross - conjugated polyenes ( fig. 1 ) whose relative instability had prevented them from being successfully produced in large quantities [ 3 ] .
recently , sherburn reported the synthesis of the first six members of the parent dendralene series on gram scales [ 4 - 8 ] .
initial studies have shown that the odd - numbered dendralenes are much more chemically reactive than the even - numbered dendralenes .

in turn , radialenes are cyclic cross - conjugated polyenes which exhibit a general formula of c2 nh2 n and contain n ring atoms and n exocyclic double bonds ( fig. 1 ) [ 9 ] .
like their acyclic dendralene analogues , radialenes have proven to be a significant synthetic challenge .
the parent compounds [ 3 ] - and [ 4 ] radialene were initially prepared in the 1960 's , however , progress since then has been protracted [ 10 - 12 ] .
derivatives of [ 3 ] radialene containing aryl and heteroaryl moieties have gained more interest than the parent compound itself due to their increased stability .
the preparation of hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialenes , using fukunaga 's method of reacting stabilised carbanions with tetrachlorocyclopropene [ 13 - 14 ] , was originally reported by oda [ 15 - 16 ] .
hexapyridyl [ 3 ] radialenes were obtained shortly afterwards with the synthesis of hexa ( 2 - pyridyl )[ 3 ] radialene being reported concurrently by oda and steel [ 17 - 18 ] .
the coordination chemistry of hexaaryl - and hexapyridyl [ 3 ] radialenes has been studied to a limited extent [ 18 - 21 ] .
three coordination modes were observed for hexa ( 2 - pyridyl )[ 3 ] radialene with ag ( i ) : a discrete m6l2 cage , a 1 - d coordination polymer composed of m3l2 cages bridged by linear silver atoms , and a second 1 - d coordination polymer where the radialene ligand acts as a tetradentate bridge [ 18 - 19 ] .
hexa ( 4 - pyridyl )[ 3 ] radialene also acts as a bridging ligand in a 3 - d coordination polymer with agclo4 [ 20 ] , while isomorphous 6,3 - connected 2 - d coordination polymers were obtained when hexakis ( 4 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene was reacted with agpf6 and agclo4 [ 21 ] .
anion - pi interactions have recently received much attention [ 22 - 26 ] , where the pi - system is typically an electron deficient heterocyclic system .
the electron deficient nature of the hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialenes is borne out in structures of these compounds which also show anion - pi interactions and ch ... xanion hydrogen bonding in the solid - state [ 17,21 ] .
hexa ( 2 - pyridyl )[ 3 ] radialene exhibits a very short contact ( 2.67 a ) between the radialene pi - system and a fluoride anion in its hexanuclear silver ( i ) cage structure [ 18 ] .
hexakis ( 4 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene also shows anion - pi interactions involving the pf6 - and clo4 - anions in the solid - state [ 21 ] .
cyclic voltammetry experiments show that the most electron deficient hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialene synthesised thus far is hexakis ( 4 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene [ 17 ] .
the focus of our current work is the synthesis of new hexaaryl - and hexa - heteroaryl [ 3 ] radialenes which are more electron deficient and , therefore , more disposed toward forming anion - pi interactions .
ultimately , the most desirable of these compounds will be able to form capsular metallo - supramolecular assemblies .
herein , we outline the synthesis of three new [ 3 ] radialene derivatives ( 1 - 3 ) , including the most electron deficient hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialene observed thus far , and studies of their electrochemical and photophysical properties .
results and discussion the first new [ 3 ] radialene compound targeted was hexa ( pyrazol - 1 - yl )[ 3 ] radialene .
however , the required starting material , 1 - [( 1h - pyrazol - 1 - yl ) methyl ] - 1h - pyrazole , undergoes non - specific lithiation with n - butyllithium [ 27 ] .
as selective lithiation at the methane position is required , bis ( 3,5 - dimethylpyrazol - 1 - yl ) methane [ 28 ] - where the 3 - and 5 - positions are blocked with methyl groups - was used to give hexakis ( 3,5 - dimethylpyrazol - 1 - yl )[ 3 ] radialene ( 1 ) via fukunaga 's method in 14 % yield .
the poor yield for this reaction was attributed to the considerable steric hindrance deriving from the 12 methyl substituents and , despite considerable effort , could not be optimised further .
the compound was readily identified by its intense yellow - green solutions and the considerable upfield shifts of the pyrazole h4 proton ( 5.69 ppm ) and the methyl hydrogen atoms ( 1.80 and 2.07 ppm ) arising from the double - bladed propeller conformation adopted by 1 .
in addition to the study of [ 3 ] radialenes with heterocyclic donors [ 18 - 19 ] , we have devoted substantial attention to the study of [ 3 ] radialenes with nitrile donors in the 4 - position of the aryl ring [ 21 ] and thus , undertook the synthesis of the isomeric compound , hexakis ( 3 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene ( 2 ) .
the precursor 6 was synthesised from 3,3 ' - diaminodiphenylmethane ( 4 ) [ 29 - 31 ] in two steps : diazotisation and reaction with potassium iodide to afford 3,3 ' - diiododiphenylmethane ( 5 ) [ 32 ] followed by treatment with copper cyanide to give 3,3 ' - dicyanodiphenylmethane ( 6 ) rather than the literature route via diphenylmethane - 3,3 ' - dicarboxamide [ 33 ] .
[ 3 ] radialene 2 was obtained from 6 in 16 % yield ( scheme 1 ) .
the marked difference in yields between 2 and hexakis ( 4 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene , 73 % reported by oda [ 15 ] , is a consequence of the relative stability of the carbanions of the two dicyanodiphenylmethane precursors .
scheme 1 synthesis of ( a ) hexakis ( 3 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene ( 2 ) and ( b ) hexakis ( 3,4 - dicyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene ( 3 ) .
to maintain a high yielding synthesis whilst investigating the substitution in the 3 - position , a new strategy was developed which involved the retention of an electron withdrawing group in the 4 - position while incorporating new substitutents at the 3 - position .
the simplest demonstration of this approach is the preparation of hexakis ( 3,4 - dicyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene ( 3 ) , which was synthesised in excellent yield ( 76 % , scheme 1 ) .
the precursor methane 11 was obtained from 7 in four steps : hydrogenation on 5 % pd / c to 8 [ 34 ] , followed by reaction with formamide to give the corresponding diimide 9 , treatment with aqueous ammonia solution to yield the tetraamide 10 and finally dehydration to the tetranitrile 11 using thionyl chloride [ 35 - 36 ] .
initial attempts to synthesise 3 using the standard procedure [ 15 - 16 ] were unsuccessful .
in fact , the far greater acidity of 11 ( compared to 6 or 4,4 ' - dicyanodiphenylmethane ) allowed the use of sodium hydride instead of n - butyllithium as a base in the synthesis of 3 .
following aerial oxidation of the dianion , 3 was isolated by precipitation in saturated ammonium chloride solution .
small red crystals of compound 3 [ 37 ] , that are suitable for x - ray crystallography , were obtained by slow evaporation in acetonitrile .
the ligand crystallises in the monoclinic space group p21 / c and the asymmetric unit contains one molecule of the radialene ligand and an acetonitrile solvate molecule ( fig. 2 ) .
the small crystals were weakly diffracting but the structure refined to r 1 6.82 % with no significant disorder problems .
as expected , the [ 3 ] radialene core is planar and the " arms " extend in a double - bladed propeller conformation with torsion angles of ca .
39degrees on average which is common for hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialenes [ 18 - 20 ] .
the nitrile substituents in the 4 - position extend directly out from the structure in approximately the same plane as the core , whereas those in the 3 - position are situated above and below the plane .
in the conformation observed , four are up and two are directed down .
this type of conformation is less commonly encountered as symmetrical arrangements of multi - armed compounds , those with no net dipole , are more favoured [ 38 ] .
bond lengths and angles about the central core are consistent with a [ 3 ] radialene derivative .
each [ 3 ] radialene forms three lone pair - nitrile to electron deficient [ 3 ] radialene core carbon contacts [ 22 - 26 ] within the structure , with distances of 3.205 , 3.219 and 3.267 a. figure 2 a perspective view of the asymmetric unit of 3 .
[ 3 ] radialene compounds have been shown to undergo two one - electron reductions to yield the radical anion and dianion species [ 1 ] .
in this context , in materials science [ 1,39 - 40 ] , there is considerable interest in the use of the carbanions obtained by reduction .
up to now , the most electron deficient hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialene reported , hexakis ( 4 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene , recorded reduction potentials of - 0.63 and - 1.03 v in dichloromethane ( table 1 ) [ 17 ] .
isomer 2 is slightly harder to reduce than hexakis ( 4 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene , with potentials of - 0.80 and - 1.32 v in dichloromethane .
this is due to the inability of the nitrile groups in the 3 - position to stabilise the anion by resonance delocalisation .
a similar effect on the reduction potentials is observed for the pyridyl series [ 18,20,41 ] , whereby the change from a 2 - substituted pyridine to a 3 - substituted azine ring system results in a compound that is 0.10 v more difficult to reduce .
conversely , compound 3 is very easy to reduce .
this is shown by its reduction potentials of - 0.06 and - 0.45 v , respectively , and is attributed to the combined electron - withdrawing effect of the twelve nitrile substituents .
while compound 3 is considerably more electron deficient than other hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialenes , it still exists in its neutral form .
in contrast , other related [ 3 ] radialene compounds - such as hexacyano [ 3 ] radialene [ 13 ] - exist as stable dianions .
among the [ 3 ] radialene compounds we have been studying , this attributes a ' goldilocks' - type electron deficiency to compound 3 making it suitable for investigating anion - pi interactions .
the compound is considerably electron deficient , however , it is still maintained in its neutral form .
this will allow us to further study anion - pi interactions with these systems [ 21 ] .
the opposite extreme exists for compound 1 because the electron rich azole rings and methyl substituents make it particularly hard to reduce .
its first reduction potential is - 1.21 v and its second was not observed as it occurs outside the solvent window for dichloromethane .

most hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialenes are orange or red in colour with uv - visible absorption maxima in the range of 460 - 490 nm in dichloromethane ( table 2 , fig. 3 ) , with 2 and 3 being consistent with this observation .
compared to that , compound 1 is a yellow - brown solid with a lambdamax of 443 nm which dissolves to produce yellow - green solutions .
in dichloromethane the absorbance maxima for 1 is around 443 nm ( logepsilon = 4.33 ) , with a shoulder around 415 nm. in contrast to that , the uv - visible spectra in acetone shows two absorption peaks at around 440 and 475 nm , as well as a broad tail that extends out to approximately 600 nm. the fact that the concentrations of both solutions of 1 are similar (~ 0.04 mm ) indicates that 1 - which has 12 methyl substituents arranged above and below the [ 3 ] radialene core - aggregates in the more polar acetone solvent ( polarity index for dichloromethane 3.1 ; acetone 5.1 ) .
the less hydrophobic [ 3 ] radialenes , 2 and 3 , do not show the same behaviour .
the more electron deficient derivatives , 2 and 3 , along with the previously synthesised compounds hexa ( 2 - pyridyl )[ 3 ] radialene , hexa ( 3 - pyridyl )[ 3 ] radialene , and hexakis ( 4 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene , show a weak absorption in the near infrared ( around 800 nm ) .
this is consistent with spectra observed for the radical anions [ 17 ] .

the fluorescence of hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialenes has not been widely studied [ 42 ] .
solutions of compound 1 visibly fluoresce bright blue ; its fluorescence maximum being 467 nm in dichloromethane with a stokes shift of 124 nm ( table 2 ) .
the absorption and fluorescence properties of compound 3 had to be measured in acetone due to its limited solubility in dichloromethane ( fig. 3 ) .
hexakis ( 4 - cyanophenyl )[ 3 ] radialene and compounds 2 and 3 also exhibit large stokes shifts , of at least 130 nm , for their fluorescence maxima in acetone .
the large stokes shifts are consistent with the homo of the [ 3 ] radialene being located predominantly on the exocyclic double bonds [ 40 ] .
as a consequence , the electronic structure of the excited state is considerably more polar than that of the ground state. [ 42 ] this is consistent with the stokes shift being 10 - 20 nm larger for the spectra measured in acetone and with calculations that show intramolecular charge transfer character in the lowest excited states for hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialene derivatives [ 42 ] .
in the excited state , rotation about the exocyclic bonds of the cyclopropane ring is also possible .
the fluorescence emission of the hexaaryl [ 3 ] radialenes , coupled with the large stokes shifts , suggests that these compounds would be useful as sensor components .
indeed , our efforts to investigate anion - pi interactions [ 43 ] are being undertaken with a view to utilise [ 3 ] radialenes as a building block for the synthesis of anion sensors .
conclusion in summary , this work has shown that the range of the available [ 3 ] radialene derivatives can be extended .
however , these extensions are limited depending on the nature and position of the substituents .
it is necessary to maintain an electron - withdrawing group in the 4 - position of the aryl ring and to limit the steric bulk about the core .
as the precursor methane forms a very stable carbanion and the substituents provide minimal steric hindrance , compound 3 is obtained with an excellent yield of 76 % in the key step .
in contrast to that , the final steps of the syntheses of 1 and 2 are more difficult because the precursors have greater steric bulk and do not form carbanions with the requisite stability , respectively .
in this regard , precursor active methylene compounds with functional groups that are able to coordinate transition metals in the 3 - position and a nitro group para to the methylene are under investigation in our laboratory .
compounds 2 and 3 are electron deficient , 3 noticeably so , and undergo facile reductions to their radical anion and dianion species .
we expect that the extension of these compounds in the 3 - position will lead to the formation of new cage structures [ 18 ] which will utilise the electron deficient nature of the [ 3 ] radialene core to act as anion receptors .
the useful electrochemical and fluorescence properties of these compounds may allow them to be employed as building blocks of anion sensors .

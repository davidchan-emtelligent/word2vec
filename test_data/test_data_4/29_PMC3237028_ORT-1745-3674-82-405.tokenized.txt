background and purpose there is very little literature on the long - term outcome of wrist replacements .
the norwegian arthroplasty register has registered wrist replacements since 1994 .
we report on the total wrist replacements and their revision rates over a 16 - year period .
material and methods 189 patients with 189 primary wrist replacements ( 90 biax prostheses ( 80 of which were cementless ) , 23 cementless elos prostheses , and 76 cementless gibbon prostheses ) , operated during the period 1994 - 2009 were identified in the norwegian arthroplasty register .
prosthesis survival was analyzed using cox regression analyses .
the 3 implant designs were compared and time trends were analyzed .
results the 5 - year survival was 78 % ( 95 % ci : 70 - 85 ) and the 10 - year survival was 71 % ( ci : 59 - 80 ) .
prosthesis survival was 85 % ( ci : 78 - 93 ) at 5 years for the biax prosthesis , 77 % ( ci : 30 - 90 ) at 4 years for the gibbon prosthesis , and 57 % ( ci : 33 - 81 ) at 5 years for the elos prosthesis .
there was no statistically significant influence of age , diagnosis , or year of operation on the risk of revision , but females had a higher revision rate than males ( rr = 3 , ci : 1 - 7 ) .
the number of wrist replacements performed due to osteoarthritis increased with time , but no such change was apparent for inflammatory arthritis .
interpretation the survival of the total wrist arthroplasties studied was similar to that in other studies of wrist arthroplasties , but it was still not as good as that for most total knee and hip arthroplasties .
however , a failed wrist arthroplasty still leaves the option of a well - functioning arthrodesis .
the body of literature on wrist arthroplasty is increasing , but most studies have dealt with a single prosthesis design or have compared the outcome of wrist prosthesis to that of wrist fusion .
furthermore , most studies have been on rheumatoid patients .
to our knowledge , no randomized trials comparing different designs have ever been published .
wrist arthroplasty with silicone implants was first popularized by swanson in the 1960s ( swanson 1973 ) .
the early results of these were promising .
unfortunately , with longer follow - up , mechanical failure became apparent and severe inflammatory reaction caused by silicone disintegration ensued ( smith et al. 1985 , brase and millender 1986 , jolly et al. 1992 ) .
the second - generation wrist prostheses introduced in the 1970s typically included two metal components that articulated by means of a ball - and - socket or a hemispheric design ( meuli 1973 , volz 1976 ) .
most of these prostheses were taken off the market because of problems of joint imbalance and dislocation ( lorei et al .
1997 , carlson and simmons 1998 , vogelin and nagy 2003 ) .
the third - generation of wrist prostheses represents an effort to reconstruct the center of wrist motion in order to prevent imbalance and dislocation ( cavaliere and chung 2008 ) .
the results of total wrist arthroplasy in terms of prosthesis survival have generally been poor compared to most other prostheses .
in 2 studies in which the biax prosthesis - - a cementless third - generation implant - - was used , the 5 - year survival was found to be 83 % ( cobb and beckenbaugh 1996 ) , and the 8 - year survival was also 83 % ( takwale et al. 2002 ) .
in this study , we estimated the incidence , prosthesis survival , and causes of and risk factors for revision of wrist arthroplasties using data from the population - based norwegian arthroplasty register .
patients and methods the norwegian arthroplasty register ( nar ) started to collect data on total hip replacements in 1987 .
in 1994 , this register was extended to include all artificial joints ( havelin 1999 ) .
individual reports are received from all 7 hospitals that perform total wrist replacements in the country ( population : 4.8 million ). from 1994 through 2009 , 189 primary total wrist replacements were performed in 189 patients ( table 1 ) .
3 types of wrist prostheses were used : " biax " , " elos " , and " gibbon " ( figure 1 ) .
the biax prosthesis ( depuy , warsaw , in ) is a 3 - component prosthesis consisting of distal and proximal porous - coated metal parts and a uhmw polyethylene sliding core .
the biax prosthesis was used in the period 1994 - 2005 , and without cement in 80 of 90 cases .

3 versions of the elos prosthesis were used ( elos 1 : n = 2 ; elos 2 : n = 6 ; and elos 3 : n = 15 ) .
the 3 versions were all preliminary types of the gibbon prosthesis .
elos 1 had a short metacarpal screw which was fully threaded , as was the radial screw .
in the later versions of the elos prosthesis , the metacarpal screws were longer , the diameter smaller , and the threads lower .
the elos implants were used in the period 2000 - 2005 and without cement in all cases .
the gibbon prosthesis ( swemac , linkoping , sweden ) was ce - marked in late 2005 , and the design has not changed since .
the gibbon prosthesis changed name to motec in 2010 , without any change to the prosthesis .
the gibbon has a smaller screw diameter , and the threaded area has been changed compared to the elos 3 .
the gibbon prosthesis is a modular ( 4 - component ) prosthesis .
the articulation is cobalt chrome - molybdenum alloy treated with chromium nitride , and the stem is made of titanium alloy blasted and coated with bonit - - a resorbable calcium phosphate combination ( brush white ) .
gibbon prostheses were used from 2006 to the end of inclusion , and all were inserted without cement .
the diagnoses were grouped into " inflammatory arthritis " ( i ) ( n = 116 ) comprising rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis , and into " non - inflammatory arthritis " ( ni ) ( n = 73 ) comprising primary osteoarthritis , post - fracture disorders , ligament injuries , and joint destruction after infection .
statistics the observation time was the time from the primary replacement until revision , or until the end of the study or death .
the date of death for the patients who died was obtained from statistics norway ( www.ssb.no / english /) .
median follow - up ( observation ) time was calculated using the reverse kaplan - meier method ( schemper and smith 1996 ) .
a revision was defined as exchange or removal of the whole prosthesis or parts of the prosthesis .
we used the student t - test and analysis of variance ( anova ) to compare continuous variables .
for comparison of categorical variables , chi - square tests were used .
all p - values were 2 - tailed , and the significance level was set to 0.05 .
in the kaplan - meier survival curves , the endpoint was revision for any reason .
the survival curves were presented with log - transformed 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) and a lower limit adjustment for the number of patients at risk ( dorey and korn 1987 ) .
the survival curves were ended at 10 years or when 5 cases remained , whichever came first .
differences in revision rates between groups were tested using the log - rank test .
cox multiple regression analyses were used to study relative risks ( rrs ; hazard rate ratios ) of revision according to prosthesis type , diagnosis , age , and sex .
all relative risks were adjusted for the other variables .
poisson regression analysis was used to analyze trends in the incidence of wrist replacement procedures .
these analyses were performed based on annual population rates for the norwegian population , obtained from statistics norway .
the p - values given in the text correspond to values derived from these poisson analyses .
analyses were done using spss software version 15 and the program " r " .
results the annual number of total wrist replacements changed over time ( figure 2 ) .
a decrease in the number of arthroplasties due to inflammatory arthritis was found ( p < 0.001 ) , but operations due to noninflammatory arthritis increased ( p < 0.001 ) .

type of prosthesis the biax prosthesis was used almost exclusively in patients in the i group ( table 1 ) .
the median follow - up time was longer for the biax prosthesis ( 9.3 years ) than for the elos ( 4.6 years ) and gibbon ( 2.6 years ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
the elos prosthesis was used exclusively in the ni group , and the gibbon prosthesis was used in both groups .
revision and survival 39 ( 21 %) of the 189 wrist prostheses were revised : 10 of 23 elos prostheses , 11 of 76 gibbon prostheses , and 18 of 90 biax prostheses .
the mean time until first revision was 9.1 ( ci : 8.5 - 9.8 ) years .
the overall 5 - year and 10 - year survival was 78 % ( ci : 70 - 85 ) and 71 % ( ci : 59 - 80 ) , respectively ( figure 3 ) .
prosthesis survival was 85 % ( ci : 78 - 93 ) at 5 years for the biax prosthesis , 77 % ( ci : 30 - 90 ) at 4 years for the gibbon prosthesis , and 57 % ( ci : 33 - 81 ) at 5 years for the elos prosthesis ( figure 3 ) .

total and prosthesis - specific survival ( kaplan - meier ) with 95 % ci shown in red .
loosening of the distal component and pain were the most common reasons for revision ( table 2 ) .
for the biax prosthesis , the main causes of revision were aseptic loosening , incorrect axis , and pain .
the main cause of revision of the elos and gibbon prostheses was aseptic loosening of the distal component , but in 3 cases deep infection was the reason for revision of the gibbon prosthesis .
in no case was pain registered as the only cause of revision .

an unknown revision procedure was done in 2 wrists .
risk factors for revision females had higher revision rate than males ( rr = 3 , ci : 1 - 7 ) .
age had no statistically significant influence on prosthesis survival ( rr = 0.8 per 10 year , ci : 0.66 - 1.1 ) .
no statistically significant difference in survival was found for the patients in the two diagnosis groups ( rr = 1.2 , ci : 0 only 7 hospitals in norway performed wrist arthroplasty surgery .
the number of procedures performed in each hospital during the observation period ranged from one to 70 prostheses .
the revision rate was similar in hospitals that had performed more than or less than 50 wrist arthroplasties .
discussion the 5 - and 10 - year survival rates of 78 % and 71 % are similar to those in other studies .
in a study of 76 wrist replacements with the biax prosthesis , the 8 - year survival of the implant was found to be 83 % ( takwale et al. 2002 ) .
the 5 - year survival was also 83 % in a study of 52 patients treated with the biax prosthesis ( cobb and beckenbaugh 1996 ) .
the patients in these 3 studies were also similar to ours regarding age , sex , and diagnoses .
completeness of data the completeness of registration in the norwegian arthroplasty register was recently evaluated by comparing it to the mandatory reporting of administrative data to the norwegian patient register ( npr ) , and it was found to be 97 % for hip replacements , 99 % for knee replacements , 82 % for all primary ankle replacements , but only 52 % for wrist replacements .
one explanation for the under - reporting could be that relative to the hip and knee , few wrist replacements are performed , and that for this reason reporting to the arthroplasty register is not so well established among wrist surgeons .
the magnitude of under - reporting is unclear , however , as the nbd code group ( except for nbd 8 ) of the nomesco 2006 coding system , which is used by the hospitals in their reports to the npr , does not require it to be specified whether the prosthesis has been inserted in the radio - carpal joint or in other joints in the carpus .
also , the code nbd 99 applies to any prosthesis operation in the wrist or hand .
thus , the npr data on wrist implants most probably also include data from implants in joints other than the radio - carpal joint ( espehaug et al. 2006 ) .
we have no reason to believe that there is any systematic under - reporting to the nar .
time trends the overall incidence of reported wrist arthroplasties was unchanged in norway during the study period ( figure 3 ) .
the incidence of total wrist replacements increased with time in the ni group , but not in the i group .
these findings are consistent with a general trend in recent years , which has also been seen for other joints .
more joint replacements are being performed due to osteoarthritis , and less for inflammatory arthritis ( da silva et al. 2003 , pedersen et al. 2005 , weiss et al. 2006 , fevang et al. 2007 ) .
risk factors for revision the only factor that statistically significantly influenced survival was sex : females had a 3 - fold higher revision rate than males .
we found that there was no difference in prosthesis survival in patients with different diagnoses , which is in accordance with the results of previous studies on ankle prostheses ( spirt et al. 2004 , doets et al. 2006 ) .
prosthesis type and survival there were major differences between the prosthesis types concerning patient demographics and inclusion periods .
in the elos group , three different prostheses were used in the 23 patients ; the numbers were too small to allow us to perform a meaningful comparison of the different versions .
in the elos group , only non - inflammatory wrists were included , and in the biax group only inflammatory wrists were included .
in the gibbon group , there was a mixture of the two diagnostic groups .
in addition , the number of patients with inflammatory joint disease in the gibbon group was small .
furthermore , the 3 versions of the elos prosthesis were all preliminary types of the gibbon prosthesis .
for these reasons , and due to the small numbers , our results on differences between types should be interpreted with caution .
based on our findings , we cannot conclude that one type of prosthesis was superior to any another .
the results of wrist arthroplasty are still inferior to those of knee and hip arthroplasty , and the function may not be substantially better than with arthrodesis .
current evidence does not support widespread implementation of this procedure .
this study represents close teamwork by the orthopaedic surgeons yk , lih , of , and the statistican sal .

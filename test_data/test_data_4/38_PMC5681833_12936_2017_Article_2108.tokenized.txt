background both in endemic countries and in imported malaria , changes in total and differential leukocyte count during plasmodium falciparum infection have been described .
to study the exact dynamics of differential leukocyte counts and their ratios , they were monitored in a group of healthy non - immune volunteers in two separate controlled human malaria infection ( chmi ) studies .
methods in two chmi trials , chmi - a and chmi - b , 15 and 24 healthy malaria - naive volunteers , respectively , were exposed to bites of infected mosquitoes , using the p. falciparum research strain nf54 and the novel clones nf135.c10 and nf166.c8 .
after mosquito bite exposure , twice - daily blood draws were taken to detect parasitaemia and to monitor the total and differential leukocyte counts .
all subjects received a course of atovaquone - proguanil when meeting the treatment criteria .
results a total of 39 volunteers participated in the two trials .
thirty - five participants , all 15 participants in chmi - a and 20 of the 24 volunteers in chmi - b , developed parasitaemia .
during liver stage development of the parasite , the median total leukocyte count increased from 5.5 to 6.1 x 109 leukocytes / l ( p = 0.005 ) , the median lymphocyte count from 1.9 to 2.2 ( p = 0.001 ) and the monocyte count from 0.50 to 0.54 ( p = 0.038 ) .
during the subsequent blood stage infection , significant changes in total and differential leukocyte counts lead to a leukocytopenia ( nadir median 3.3 x 109 leukocytes / l , p = 0.0001 ) , lymphocytopenia ( nadir median 0.7 x 109 lymphocytes / l , p = 0.0001 ) and a borderline neutropenia ( nadir median 1.5 x 109 neutrophils / l , p = 0.0001 ) .
the neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio ( nlcr ) reached a maximum of 4.0 .
significant correlations were found between parasite load and absolute lymphocyte count ( p < 0.001 , correlation coefficient - 0.46 ) and between parasite load and nlcr ( p < 0.001 , correlation coefficient 0.50 ) .
all parameters normalized after parasite clearance .
conclusions during the clinically silent liver phase of malaria , an increase of peripheral total leukocyte count and differential lymphocytes and monocytes occurs .
this finding has not been described previously .
this increase is followed by the appearance of parasites in the peripheral blood after 2 - 3 days , accompanied by a marked decrease in total leukocyte count , lymphocyte count and the neutrophil count and a rise of the nlcr .

in this model , healthy volunteers are infected by malaria sporozoites via exposure to the bites of infected mosquitoes or via inoculation by needle and syringe [ 2 ] .
cmhi studies have traditionally been performed using the plasmodium falciparum strain nf54 , which is thought to originate from africa [ 3 ] .
more recently , the clones nf135.c10 , and nf166.c8 , originating from p. falciparum strains from cambodia and guinea , respectively , have been added to the chmi portfolio [ 4 - 6 ] .
in the present study , the chmi model is used to study total and differential leukocyte count changes and their ratios during the liver phase and blood phase of malaria .
changes in total and differential leukocyte count during p. falciparum infection have been described in both clinical studies and chmi studies previously .
in clinical studies , both in endemic countries and in patients with imported malaria [ 7 - 10 ] , the most pronounced change is the decrease of peripheral lymphocytes .
lymphocytopenia has been observed in 45 to 63 % of patients with an imported p. falciparum infection , but was less prominent in patients with some degree of anti - malarial immunity [ 11 , 12 ] .
in a recent large cross - sectional study on leukocyte count changes in returning travellers , malaria was the second most common cause of absolute lymphocytopenia [ 13 ] .
differential leukocyte count changes have also been studied in patients with imported malaria .
the neutrophil - to - lymphocyte count ratio ( nlcr ) , which was introduced by zahorec et al. as a parameter of systemic inflammation in critically ill surgical and medical patients [ 14 ] , correlated with parasitaemia and normalized after parasite clearance in patients with imported malaria [ 11 , 12 ] .
one study showed correlations between parasitaemia and both the monocyte to lymphocyte count ratio ( mlcr ) and neutrophil to monocyte count ratio ( nmcr ) [ 11 ] .
in chmi studies , decreases in total leukocyte count , neutrophil count and lymphocyte count have been described during the blood phase [ 15 - 20 ] , but could not evaluate leukocyte changes during liver stages of the parasite life cycle .
in the present study , the changes of differential leukocyte counts and their ratios were monitored during the liver phase and the development of detectable blood parasitaemia in a group of healthy non - immune volunteers in the chmi model using the nf54 , nf166.c8 and nf135.c10 p. falciparum clones .
methods study design the present study was performed using two controlled human malaria infection studies , chmi - a and chmi - b [ 4 ] .
healthy malaria - naive adult dutch volunteers were recruited at the harbour hospital , rotterdam , after signing informed consent .
in chmi - a , fifteen subjects were randomly allocated to three groups of n = 5 , to be infected by bites of five mosquitoes per subject carrying either the nf54 strain of p. falciparum , the nf135.c10 clone or the novel nf166.c8 clone .
in chmi - b , 24 subjects were randomly allocated to six groups of n = 4 , to bites by one , two or five mosquitoes carrying either nf135.c10 or nf166.c8. from day 5 after exposure , subjects were seen in clinic twice daily for registration of vital parameters and adverse events and for venous blood draws for thick blood smear , qpcr , and a wide range of laboratory parameters including differential leukocyte counts .
plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia was quantified by qpcr as described before [ 21 ] .
in chmi - a , subjects were treated with atovaquone - proguanil 1000 / 400 mg daily for 3 days upon their first positive thick blood smear , defined as >= 2 parasites per 225 high - powered fields ( equivalent to 0.5 microl blood ) .
in chmi - b , subjects were treated with the same regimen as soon as 2 consecutive blood samples were positive by qpcr , defined as > 500 parasites / ml. this change in treatment initiation between the two studies was implemented to minimize safety risks following a cardiac serious adverse event in a previous study [ 15 , 22 ] .
daily thick blood smears and qpcr were continued after treatment until complete clearance of asexual parasites .
data selection this study focused on leukocyte count changes during the liver stage and blood stage of the malaria infection in the participants of chmi - a and chmi - b. data from the measurements taken during the liver phase in both studies were combined .
however , the described differences in methodology regarding the initiation of treatment in both studies did not permit combination of blood phase chmi - a and chmi - b data .
for this phase , the data of only chmi - b were used , as in this study the subjects who remained qpcr negative , but received the same treatment as the parasitaemic subjects , could be used as a negative control group to exclude an effect of the atovaquone - proguanil on the evaluated parameters .
statistical analysis to determine whether the parameters of interest changed over time a friedman test was performed .
next , a more detailed analysis of the timing of these changes was done using a linear model .
correlations were tested with the spearman 's rank - order correlation .
data were not normally distributed and given as median ( interquartile range ) unless stated otherwise .
definitions leukocytopenia leukocyte count < 4.0 x 109 / l ; lymphocytopenia lymphocyte count < 1.0 x 109 / l ; neutropenia neutrophil count < 1.5 x 109 / l. day of treatment ( dt ) the day the subject started a 3 - day course of atovaquone - proguanil , directly upon meeting the treatment criteria .
the days from 2 days before until 3 days after this day are named dt - 2 to dt + 3 .
liver phase the subjects who eventually developed parasitaemia were regarded as being in the liver phase on day 5 and 6 of the study protocol , when the peripheral blood samples of all subjects were still qpcr negative .
detectable blood parasitaemia detectable blood parasitaemia is defined as qpcr positive , a method with a detection limit of 50 parasites per ml. results development of parasitaemia and phases of the infection in chmi - a , all participants developed parasitaemia , with a median prepatent period of 8 days ( range 6.5 - 10.5 days ) , determined by thick blood smear , upon which curative treatment was initiated .
as determined retrospectively , all subjects were still qpcr negative on day 5 and 6 of the study protocol. of the 24 participants in chmi - b , twenty ( 83 %) developed parasitaemia .
the median prepatent period as determined by qpcr was 7 days ( range 7 - 9 days ) and the median time between exposure and the day the treatment criteria were met ( hereafter called day of treatment [ dt ]) was 8 days ( range 7 - 11 days ) .
for chmi - b , the data from 2 days before dt ( dt - 2 ) until 3 days after dt ( dt + 3 ) were synchronized on dt ( fig. 1 ) .
on dt - 2 , four subjects had a positive qpcr , all with a low parasitaemia ( 385 - 713 parasites / ml ) and did not meet the treatment criteria at that moment .
the number of parasitaemic subjects increased to nine subjects on dt - 1 .
the median parasite load on dt , when all patients met the treatment criteria , was 6265 parasites per ml. hereafter the parasite load declined to 1099 on dt + 1 and 100 parasites per ml on dt + 2. fig. 1 changes in total and differential leukocyte counts in the 20 subjects who developed malaria in chmi - b. the data are shown as medians ( dots ) and interquartile ranges ( whiskers ) .
the data from dt - 2 until dt + 3 were synchronized on dt changes in differential leukocyte counts and count ratios during the liver phase all 35 subjects who developed detectable parasitaemia in chmi - a and chmi - b were still qpcr negative at day 5 and 6 of the study protocol , and the infection was therefore regarded as being in the liver phase [ 23 ] .
during this phase an increase of the total leukocyte count , lymphocyte count and the monocyte count was observed in the 35 subjects who developed parasitaemia later on in chmi - a and chmi - b. changes in neutrophil count and the differential cell count ratios were not significant .
no significant changes were observed in the four subjects who remained qpcr negative in chmi - b. no differences between the total or differential leukocyte counts were found between subjects infected with nf54 strain , the nf135.c10 clone or the nf166.c8 clone ( table 1 ) .

p values in this table were derived from friedman tests linear model analysis showed that in the individuals who develop parasitaemia , the leukocyte count remained stable until dt - 1 and then showed a fall , which continued until it reached its nadir on dt + 2 , with a median of 3.3 x 105 leukocytes / l. on day dt + 2 , a leukocytopenia was observed in 70 % ( 14 / 20 ) of the subjects .
the absolute neutrophil count started to decrease on dt - 1 to a median value of 1.5 x 105 neutrophils / l on dt + 3 .
neutropenia was found in 40 % ( 8 / 20 ) of the subjects on this day .
a steady fall in absolute lymphocyte count was observed from dt - 2 until dt + 2 , when the median lymphocyte count was 0.7 x 105 lymphocytes / l. the percentage of subjects with an absolute lymphocytopenia increased from 30 % ( 6 / 20 ) on dt to 70 % ( 14 / 20 ) 2 days later .
the median absolute monocyte counts remained within the normal range , but showed a mild drop on dt + 2 .
on day 35 of the study protocol , all parameters had returned to baseline values .
the evaluated parameters did not differ significantly between subgroups of subjects infected with nf166.c8 and nf135.c10 .
the differential cell count ratios were also found to change significantly over time using the friedman test ( table 1 , fig. 2 ) .
the linear model analysis showed a gradual rise of the nlcr , reaching a maximum of 4.0 on dt + 1 .
after dt + 1 a rapid decrease was observed .
the mlcr showed a rise from dt - 2 to dt + 1 after which it decreased .
the nmcr seemed to show a rise followed by a fall but these changes were not significant in the linear model analysis. fig. 2 changes in differential cell count ratios in the 20 subjects who developed malaria in chmi - b. the data are shown as medians ( dots ) and interquartile ranges ( whiskers ) .
the data from dt - 2 until dt + 3 were synchronized on dt in the four subjects that remained qpcr negative throughout the study period , the differential leukocyte counts remained within normal values and no significant changes in cell counts or cell count ratios were observed .
all four received a full course of atovaquone - proguanil at day 13 of the study protocol ( additional file 1 : table s1 and additional file 3 : figure s2 ) .
correlations significant correlations were found between parasite load and absolute lymphocyte count ( p < 0.001 , correlation coefficient - 0.46 ) and between parasite load and nlcr ( p < 0.001 , correlation coefficient 0.50 ) in chmi - b. correlations between parasite load and total leukocyte count , mlcr and nmcr were significant , but weak ( p = 0.004 , spearman 's rho ( rs ) - 0.23 , p < 0.001 , rs 0.36 and p = 0.003 , rs 0.23 , respectively ) .
there was no significant correlation between parasite load and absolute neutrophil count or absolute monocyte count .
discussion the present chmi study shows an increase in total leukocyte , lymphocyte and monocyte count during parasite liver stages of infected subjects .
upon blood stage infection , a decrease is observed in total leukocyte , neutrophil , lymphocyte and monocyte count ; these changes clearly relate to the occurrence of blood parasitaemia and are not caused by treatment with atovaquone - proguanil , as shown by the control group of four subjects , who remained non - parasitaemic until day 13 after mosquito exposure and were then treated with a full course of atovaquone - proguanil .
although it cannot be excluded that one or more of these four non - parasitaemic subjects had a liver stage infection when treatment was initiated , we regard it more likely that no sporozoite transmission occurred .
in this group , no changes in total or differential leukocyte counts were observed during the study period .
the increase of the total leukocyte count , lymphocytes and monocytes during liver stage development has not been previously reported .
during the clinically silent liver phase of malaria , only a relatively low number of hepatocytes become infected and the host immune responses to this stage of the parasite are poorly understood [ 24 ] .
previous chmi studies have studied inflammatory parameters and cellular and humoral immune responses , but only demonstrated changes in these markers during the blood phase of the infection [ 15 - 20 , 25 ] .
the finding that the total leukocyte count , lymphocyte count and monocyte count show an increase during the liver phase is remarkable and further studies are needed to confirm this finding and to elucidate its underlying pathophysiological mechanism .
the most pronounced change after the liver phase is a fall in lymphocyte count that starts on dt - 1 and reaches its nadir at 0.7 x 105 lymphocytes / l on dt + 2 , when 65 % of subjects are lymphocytopenic .
the neutrophil count only starts to show a significant fall after dt. these changes are reflected in the nlcr , which shows a steep rise to 4.0 on dt + 2 .
in comparison , in a previous study on patients with imported malaria the median nlcr on admission of all patients was 3.2 , and 3.5 in patients with a severe p. falciparum infection [ 12 ] .
lymphocytopenia has been described in several large cohorts of patients with malaria [ 9 , 26 - 28 ] and is highly prevalent in symptomatic travelers with imported malaria [ 12 ] .
the correlations between parasite and lymphocyte count and between parasite load and nlcr were also demonstrated in a study by berens - riha et al .
[ 11 ] , in which patients were stratified according to their immune status .
both the mlcr and the nlcr were found to be lower in semi - immune patients as compared to non - immune patients .
in the present study , all subjects were non - immune .
white blood cell count changes have also been described in previous chmi studies .
in a study on clinical manifestations in chmi with p. falciparum , church et al. described a decrease in total white blood cell count and in neutrophil count , but not in lymphocyte count , with the nadir occurring 2 days after therapy initiation [ 15 ] .
a decrease in lymphocyte count was observed in several studies involving sporozoite infection after mosquito bite exposure [ 16 - 19 ] and in a study using experimental inoculation with a low number of parasitized erythrocytes [ 20 ] .
these observations are in line with the findings described here .
as no measurements are available between dt + 3 and the end of the study protocol at day 35 , we are not able to monitor when the changes observed , started to normalize after treatment .
this is an important limitation of the study .
several mechanisms have been proposed as an explanation for malaria induced lymphocytopenia .
a temporary reallocation of lymphocytes has been suggested , which is supported by the observation that lymphocytes rapidly re - emerge in the peripheral circulation after treatment is initiated [ 29 ] .
others suggest that the soluble fas ligand induces apoptosis of lymphocytes , which has been observed both in vitro and in healthy donors from endemic areas [ 30 - 34 ] , and a previous chmi study found an increased production of granzyme b , which is also know to induce apoptosis , in exposed individuals , [ 35 ] .
both mechanisms though might be partly responsible for the observed fall in lymphocyte cell count .
conclusions in a setting of controlled human malaria infection in healthy non - immune volunteers , an initial increase of peripheral total leukocyte count and differential lymphocytes and monocytes was observed during liver stage infection of 35 infected volunteers .
this rise seems to indicate the presence of a malaria infection and is followed 2 - 3 days later by the appearance of parasites in the peripheral blood , which is accompanied by a marked decrease in total leukocyte count , lymphocyte count and the neutrophil count and a rise of the nlcr .
both the lymphocyte count and the nlcr correlated with blood parasitaemia , and all parameters had normalized 3 - 4 weeks after parasite clearance .
the non - parasitaemic control group in this study excludes a treatment - related effect .

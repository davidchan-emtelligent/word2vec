introduction irisin is considered to be a myokine and adipokine that may also participate in reproductive functions , as it increases significantly throughout pregnancy .
however , the regulation of circulating irisin and its relationship with other cytokines has not been assessed thus far in pregnant women and their offspring .
objective the aim of this study was to evaluate differences in irisin and cytokine concentrations between women at the end of pregnancy and their offspring , as well as the relationship between maternal and newborn irisin and maternal and newborn biomarkers .
methods twenty - eight mother / newborn pairs were included in this study .
the following biomarkers were evaluated in maternal venous and arterial umbilical cord blood samples : irisin , 27 cytokine panel , total antioxidant capacity ( tac ) , total plasma protein , and free fatty acid concentration .
results the newborns had significantly lower irisin concentrations compared to their mothers ( p = 0.03 ) , but this difference was present only in babies born from mothers without labor prior to cesarean section delivery ( p = 0.01 ) .
no significant differences in maternal and newborn irisin concentrations were found between diabetic and non - diabetic mothers or between overweight / obese and normal weight mothers .
a significant positive correlation was found between tac level and irisin concentration in newborns .
maternal and newborn interleukin ( il ) - 1beta , il - 1ra , il - 5 , il - 7 , and interferon gamma - induced protein ( ip ) - 10 levels were significantly positively correlated with irisin concentrations in both study groups .
in addition , maternal il1beta , il - 5 , il - 7 , and ip - 10 levels positively predicted maternal irisin concentrations .
furthermore , arterial cord blood tac and il - 1beta and il1 - ra levels positively predicted newborn irisin concentrations .
multiple regression analyses showed that maternal il - 13 negatively predicted offspring irisin levels ( p = 0.03 ) and that maternal il - 1beta positively predicted newborn irisin concentrations ( p = 0.046 ) .
conclusion no evidence was found that serum irisin concentrations in mothers at pregnancy termination or those of their newborns correlated with maternal body mass index , the presence of diabetes mellitus , or free fatty acid levels .
however , the results of this study indicated that cytokines might predict irisin concentration in mothers and their offspring , although interactions between irisin levels during pregnancy and the newborn have not yet been fully elucidated .

introduction in 2012 , bostrom et al. discovered irisin , a myokine capable of inducing fat browning and increasing energy expenditure [ 1 ] .
some studies refer that this myokine is secreted after exercise due to proteolytic cleavage of the membrane protein fibronectin - type iii domain - containing protein 5 ( fndc5 )[ 1 - 3 ] .
other researchers have only found an increase in irisin during acute exercise in seniors [ 4 ] .
moreover , some authors have failed to demonstrate an effect of exercise on irisin concentrations [ 5 - 7 ] , indicating that the irisin - exercise relationship is not completely understood .
raschke et al. showed a mutation ( atg to ata ) in the conserved start codon of the fndc5 gene in humans that might account for a very low fndc5 mrna translation into protein [ 7 ] .
even though irisin appears to have a non - canonical ata translation start in humans , the presence of circulating irisin has been confirmed by mass spectrometry [ 3 ] .
since its discovery , extensive research has been carried out to understand the role of irisin in disorders associated with insulin resistance , such as obesity and diabetes mellitus ( dm ) [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] .
pregnancy is known to be a state of progressive insulin resistance during which levels similar to those of dm patients are reached [ 10 ] .
circulating levels of irisin are also higher in pregnant women than in non - pregnant women [ 11 ] .
interestingly , irisin levels are lower in pregnant women with gestational dm ( gdm ) compared to body mass index ( bmi ) - matched glucose tolerant patients [ 12 - 14 ] .
maternal metabolic alterations can lead to complications such as macrosomia in newborns , and recent reports have shown that newborn irisin levels correlated with birthweight [ 15 ] .
in addition , lower irisin levels have been found in cord blood samples from newborns with intrauterine growth restriction , which may result in less browning of adipose tissue in these babies [ 16 ] .
thus , irisin might play an important role in the regulation of maternal - fetal glucose homeostasis .
pregnancy is also associated with increased oxidative stress [ 17 , 18 ] .
it has been reported that total antioxidant capacity ( tac ) is lower during the first 30 weeks of pregnancy and increases to normal levels after reaching 37 weeks of gestation or labor [ 17 ] .
irisin has been shown to prevent oxidative stress in the liver through the inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase - 3 [ 19 ] .
however , whether irisin plays a role in the redox state during pregnancy is not known .
furthermore , normal gestation has been described as an inflammatory state [ 20 - 22 ] .
while irisin has been labeled as a contraction - regulated myokine along with interleukin ( il ) - 6 , il - 15 , and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 [ 23 ] , unlike the others , it does not function as an inflammatory cytokine and does not activate nuclear factor kappa b inflammatory pathways [ 24 ] .
in fact , it might actually have anti - inflammatory properties , as it can reduce the gene expression of il - 6 , tumor necrosis factor alpha , macrophage inflammatory protein ( mip ) - 1alpha , and mip - 1beta [ 25 ] .
nonetheless , whether irisin is associated with inflammatory markers during pregnancy is unknown .
the aim of this study was to evaluate differences in irisin concentrations between women at the end of pregnancy and their newborns , as well as the relationship between maternal and offspring irisin and maternal and newborn biomarkers .
materials and methods this study was conducted at instituto nacional de perinatologia , a third - level health care institution in mexico city .
the research and ethics committees of the instituto nacional de perinatologia " isidro espinosa de los reyes " approved the study prior to patient enrollment .
written informed consent was also obtained from all the participants .
upon admission to the labor and delivery unit , women who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate signed an informed consent form .
only patients with single , non - complicated pregnancies who had not received medication three weeks prior to delivery were enrolled in the study .
twenty - eight women were recruited , and their obstetric outcomes and clinical and demographic data were retrieved from their medical records .
maternal blood was obtained by venipuncture prior to delivery , and neonatal blood was obtained after placental delivery using a sterile method by umbilical cord arterial puncture .
the blood was collected in heparinized , mineral - free , bd vacutainer brand tubes ( nj , usa ) , centrifuged at 3500 rpm , and the erythrocytes and plasma were aliquoted in mineral - free vials .
the samples were maintained under refrigerated conditions at all times until stored in an ultra - freezer at - 86degreesc for further analysis .
irisin , free fatty acid , tac , plasma protein , and cytokine concentrations of all samples were measured .
irisin quantitation irisin levels were measured using a commercial human irisin enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) kit ( phoenix pharmaceuticals , burlingame , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the detection range was 0.07 - 1024.00 ng / ml. each sample was assayed in duplicate and the means were used for analysis .
the intra - and interassay variation coefficients were 7.0 % and 9.5 % , respectively .
cytokine quantitation cytokine concentrations in maternal and umbilical blood serum were measured using a 27 - plex panel cytokine assay ( bio - plex ; bio - rad , ca , usa ) .
plasma protein concentration plasma proteins were quantitated using lowry 's method [ 26 ] .
total antioxidant capacity ( tac ) the cupric reducing antioxidant capacity spectrophotometric method was used to measure tac , which resulted in an absorbance at 450 nm [ 27 ] .
free fatty acid quantitation free fatty acid concentrations were assessed using the colorimetric method developed by duncombe [ 28 ] .
statistical analysis spss software version 22 ( ibm , armonk , ny , usa ) was used to conduct the statistical analyses .
before executing the analyses , the assessment of univariate and multivariate outliers was performed .
data was tested for univariate and multivariate normality , linearity , and homoscedasticity .
no variables required transformation .
the statistical analyses performed included paired and independent samples student 's t tests , pearson 's correlations , and multiple linear regression analyses .
a probability of alpha error < 0.05 was considered significant results descriptive statistics twenty - eight mother / newborn pairs were included in this study .
maternal mean age was 30.29 years ( standard deviation [ sd ] 7.93 ) and mean pre - pregnancy body mass index ( bmi ) was 26.4 kg / m2 ( sd 5.2 ) .
seventeen ( 60.7 %) of the women enrolled in this study were obese or overweight , with a pre - pregnancy bmi >= 25 kg / m2 ; 20 participants ( 71.4 %) were overweight at pregnancy termination .

significant results ( p <= 0.05 ) in bold as shown in fig 1b , mothers with pre - pregnancy normal weights had significantly higher irisin concentrations compared to their offspring ( 171.3 +/ - 124.6 vs. 88.7 +/ - 81.4 ng / ml , p < 0.04 ) ; this difference was not reflected in overweight mothers ( 135.8 +/ - 137.2 vs. 81.6 +/ - 65.5 , ng / ml , p < 0.2 ) .
there were no differences in irisin concentrations between mothers and newborns according to bmi at the end of pregnancy , gdm diagnosis , or offspring gender ( table 2 ) .
maternal and newborn clinical characteristics were compared between normal weight vs. overweight and diabetic vs. non - diabetic mothers .
unpaired student 's t tests were performed to evaluate differences between those groups for the following parameters : maternal age , weight gain during pregnancy , gestational age at birth , newborn length , head circumference , thoracic perimeter , and abdominal circumference ( table 3 ) .
diabetic mothers were nearly nine years older than non - diabetic mothers ( 36.2 +/ - 5.2 vs. 27.6 +/ - 7.6 years , p < 0.0.5 ) .

significant results ( p <= 0.05 ) in bold .
tac was almost 50 % higher in maternal samples than in cord blood samples ( 1.339 +/ - 0.152 vs. 0.7067 +/ - 0.428 mumol trolox equivalents / ml , p < 0.000 ) .
these differences were also present when analyzing tac by pre - pregnancy and end of pregnancy bmi ( data not shown ) .
mean protein concentration was 64.77 +/ - 6.54 mg / ml in the maternal samples and 26.1 +/ - 13.3 mg / ml in the newborn samples .
cord blood sample protein concentration was almost 60 % lower compared to that of the mother , which might explain the differences in tac values .
to study whether irisin levels were dependent on other clinical variables or biomarkers , multiple linear regression and pearson 's correlation were used .
pearson 's correlation revealed a significant positive correlation between offspring tac and irisin concentrations .
on the other hand , maternal and newborn il - 1beta , il - 1ra , il - 5 , il - 7 , and interferon gamma - induced protein 10 had significant positive correlations with irisin concentrations in both study groups .
cord blood il - 6 , interferon gamma , monocyte chemotactic and activating factor ( mcaf ) , and regulated on activation normal t - cell expressed and secreted cytokine ( rantes ) had significant positive correlations with offspring irisin concentrations , whereas maternal il - 10 correlated positively with maternal irisin concentrations .
conversely , free fatty acid concentrations did not correlate with irisin concentrations in mothers ( r = 0.02 , p = 0.8 ) or newborns ( r = 0.34 , p = 0.06 ) ( data not shown ) .
multiple lineal regression analyses were performed to evaluate whether tac or cytokines predict maternal or offspring irisin concentrations .
four independent variables were entered per analysis .
the results indicated that maternal il - 1beta , il - 5 , il - 7 , and ip - 10 positively predicted maternal irisin concentrations and that arterial cord blood tac , il - 1beta , and il1 - ra , positively predicted newborn irisin concentrations .
on the other hand , newborn platelet - derived growth factor , il - 7 , and mcaf negatively predicted newborn irisin concentrations .
while cord blood tac positively predicted newborn irisin concentrations , tac did not predict maternal irisin levels .
table 4 shows pearson 's r values , b coefficients , and significant values for regression analyses between maternal biomarkers and maternal irisin and between newborn biomarkers and newborn irisin concentrations .
notably , total plasma protein levels did not significantly predict or correlate with irisin concentrations in either the mothers or the offspring .

discussion in accordance with previous reports , we found that irisin concentrations were lower in newborns compared with their mothers [ 29 , 30 ] ; however , this difference was not present in mother - newborn pairs who did not go through labor ( fig 1a ) .
in this regard , has been established that irisin secretion is increased by exercise [ 1 , 3 ] ; therefore , the physical stress related to labor [ 31 ] , possibly mimicking physical activity , might explain the higher irisin levels in those newborns .
several groups have characterized irisin changes in pathological conditions such as obesity and dm. it has been reported that serum irisin concentrations in non - pregnant obese patients are elevated and positively correlated with bmi [ 32 , 33 ] .
in type 2 dm studies , studies have reported that non - pregnant patients were found to have lower irisin levels , showing a potential role in insulin resistance [ 6 , 34 , 35 ] .
however , al - daghri et al. found significantly higher levels of irisin in non - pregnant women with type ii diabetes mellitus compared to controls and it was not associated to the level of habitual physical activity in these patients [ 36 ] .
alterations in circulating irisin during pregnancy are less clear .
while two different groups found no correlation between bmi and irisin in obese pregnant patients [ 11 , 37 ] , lower levels of irisin were reported in gdm patients by two other studies [ 12 , 30 ] .
another study found no difference in circulating irisin between healthy and gdm pregnancies ; however , irisin was independently predicted by fasting glucose [ 38 ] .
similarly , garces et al. found a positive linear correlation between irisin and the homeostatic model assessment index for insulin resistance [ 11 ] .
the results of the current study showed higher irisin levels in mothers compared to newborns in patients with healthy pre - pregnancy weights compared to overweight patients .
in accordance with previous reports [ 11 , 37 ] , there were no differences in maternal irisin concentrations related to bmi ( table 1 ) .
our results are similar to those of ebert et al .
[ 38 ] , as we found no differences in irisin concentrations between pregnant women with and without gdm or in their offspring .
we also found no correlation between free fatty acids and irisin levels in mothers and offspring .
likewise , lopez - legarrea et al. found no correlation between irisin levels and free fatty acids [ 8 ] , and wang et al. provided evidence that a relatively higher concentration of irisin had no effect on lipolysis in mature 3t3 - l1 adipocytes [ 39 ] .
the newborn irisin concentrations in our study were similar to those reported by baka et al .
[ 15 ] .
however , irisin levels did not correlate with newborn weight in this study , which differed from the results of caglar et al. and baka et al .
[ 15 , 29 ] .
we also found no correlation between umbilical artery irisin and gestational age , which is similar to the results of ebert el al .
[ 29 , 38 ] .
under normal conditions , arterial cord blood protein concentration may be around 28 - 53 % lower than the concentration in maternal serum [ 40 ] , which is similar to what was found in the current study .
several authors believe that newborn irisin may be maternally inherited [ 15 , 41 ] .
according to al gadhri , irisin concentrations in the newborn are promoted by maternal factors that participate in energy regulation , specifically , high - density lipoprotein cholesterol [ 41 ] .
this biomarker was not evaluated in this study .
nonetheless , we found that newborn tac and il - 1beta predicted and positively correlated with newborn irisin levels .
while newborn il - 1beta , mcaf , and il - 7 negatively correlated with newborn irisin concentrations in our study , al - daghri et al. found that newborn angiotensin ii predicts irisin levels in the offspring [ 41 ] .
we found that lower levels of maternal il - 13 are associated with higher offspring irisin concentrations .
to our knowledge , there are no published studies on this subject , and we have no clear explanation for it. il - 13 has il - 4 - like activities and has been related to atopic disease [ 42 ] .
it is considered a th2 - type cytokine and , similar to il - 10 , it may inhibit macrophage activity [ 43 ] .
this cytokine is produced in considerable amounts by the placenta during pregnancy , and lower il - 13 levels in the newborn have been related to increased risk of atopy [ 42 ] .
il - 13 is also considered to be a myokine , and it might promote increased glucose uptake and glucose oxidation [ 44 , 45 ] .
contrary to meteorin - like myokine , a factor secreted in adipose tissues and muscles after cold exposure exercise , irisin does not increase gene expression of il - 13 or lead to alternative macrophage activation [ 46 ] .
in the current study , maternal il - 13 inversely correlated with offspring irisin .
although irisin has not been associated with il - 1beta in previous studies , we found that maternal il - 1beta positively predicted offspring irisin concentrations .
irisin has mostly been associated with il - 6 , il - 8 , and il - 15 because contractile activity might induce expression of these cytokines in skeletal muscle [ 47 ] ; however , there is little information regarding the relationship of irisin with other cytokines .
clearly , the relationship between maternal cytokine concentrations and newborn irisin concentrations requires further investigation .
this study has some limitations .
first , due to the rigorous inclusion criteria , few patients met the criteria for enrollment and , although we had significant results , we worked with a small sample size .
certainly , a larger sample size could have increased the possibility of achieving significant results , especially in interactions that produced small effects .
it is noteworthy that contradictory findings have been reported regarding the nature and concentration of serum fndc5 / irisin [ 48 ] and several articles have not only questioned the relevance of irisin in humans but the degree of shedding of soluble irisin as well [ 5 ] .
besides , research in humans using recombinant irisin does not reflect the same functions that have been reported in mice , especially regarding the brightening of adipocytes [ 7 ] .
some studies have also raised doubt concerning irisin secretion by skeletal muscle cells [ 23 ] and others refer that this myokine may be present in such low concentrations that may render a physiological role for irisin very unlikely [ 49 ] .
additionally , the validity of the commercially available irisin quantitation elisa methods has been questioned , arguing that they may be reporting cross - reacting antibodies and a potential null mutation on human fndc5 [ 49 , 50 ] .
because of the possible deficiencies in irisin detection methods reported in previous studies [ 49 ] , in this work we used the irisin detection method whose antibody has been validated by three different groups by immunohistochemistry [ 51 - 53 ] , the commercial elisa kit by phoenix pharmaceuticals [ 54 ] .
in spite of studies challenging the possible effects of irisin , several others support its physiological roles .
recently , a paper using mass spectroscopy demonstrated that human irisin is translated from a non - canonical start codon , it circulates in plasma and is regulated by aerobic exercise [ 3 ] .
moreover , studies have shown that adipose tissue expresses and secretes irisin .
interestingly , it may be increased in patients with metabolic disturbances , such as obesity ; and weight loss and fat mass reduction can be responsible for a decrease in fndc5 / irisin concentration [ 48 ] .
however , we did not find a correlation between irisin and bmi or the presence of dm in this study .
it is evident that further studies are warranted in order to clarify the controversy that remains in the literature regarding fndc5 / irisin .
conclusions a growing body of evidence has revealed an important role for irisin in metabolism .
however , in the present study , we found no proof that serum irisin concentrations in mothers at pregnancy termination or in their newborns correlated with bmi , the presence of dm , levels of free fatty acids , or the offspring 's gestational age or birth weight .
nonetheless , interesting findings came about regarding the relationships between irisin and other biomarkers , such as tac and cytokines , the latter being relevant for fetal - placental development .
as irisin has recently been considered to be an adipo - myokine and it might be closely related to some cytokines , it might be a participant in endocrine and immune system cross - talk during pregnancy .
unfortunately , the mechanisms originating irisin production and its interactions with other biomarkers during the gestational period and in the newborn still remain unascertained .

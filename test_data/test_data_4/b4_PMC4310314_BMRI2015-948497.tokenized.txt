neoplastic meningitis is a central nervous system complication that occurs in 3 - 5 % of patients with cancer .
although most commonly seen in patients with disseminated disease , in a small percentage of patients , it may be the initial manifestation of cancer or even primitive in origin .
in the absence of cancer history , the diagnosis of neoplastic meningitis may be challenging even for expert neurologists .
prognosis is poor , with a median overall survival of weeks from diagnosis .
in the retrospective study herein , we described three cases of meningeal melanomatosis in patients without previous cancer history .
the patients were diagnosed with significant delay ( 17 to 47 weeks from symptom onset ) mainly due to the deferral in performing the appropriate testing .
even when the diagnosis was suspected , investigations by mri , cerebrospinal fluid , or both proved at times unhelpful for confirmation .
prognosis was dismal , with a median survival of 4 weeks after diagnosis .
our observations are a cue to analyze the main pitfalls in the diagnosis of neoplastic meningitis in patients without cancer history and emphasize key elements that may facilitate early diagnosis .
1. introduction neoplastic meningitis is a central nervous system complication that occurs in 3 - 5 % of patients with cancer [ 1 ] , and it is most commonly seen in patients with disseminated progressive systemic disease due to spread of malignant cells to the leptomeninges .
the most common primary tumors to metastasize to the meninges are lung cancer ( 9 - 25 % of patients ) [ 2 ] and melanoma ( 23 %) [ 3 ] , due to a distinctive neurotropism .
more rarely neoplastic meningitis is the initial manifestation of systemic cancer ( 5 - 10 %) [ 1 ] or it is primitive in origin , as it occurs in primary leptomeningeal melanomatosis [ 4 ] .
in patients without cancer history , diagnosis may be challenging even for expert neurologists due to the lack of specific signs and symptoms .
prognosis of neoplastic meningitis is poor , as most untreated patients die within 1 - 9 weeks from diagnosis ( median 3 weeks ) [ 1 , 5 ] , as a result of neurological disease or tumor progression .
the timeliness of diagnosis is crucial to start the appropriate treatment before sudden neurological deterioration .
here , we present a retrospective series of three patients with meningeal melanomatosis without history of cancer , characterized by a dramatic diagnostic delay .
we also propose an algorithm focused on the diagnosis of neoplastic meningitis in naive patients .
2. materials and methods we describe a retrospective series of three patients with meningeal melanomatosis recruited from our two institutions ( c. mondino national neurological institute and policlinico san matteo foundation irccs , pavia , italy ) in four years .
we conducted an internal review board approved study using an institutional oncological database of all patients receiving a diagnosis of meningeal melanomatosis from january 2010 to january 2014 .
the medical records were reviewed and clinical , biological , and radiological data collected for details .
3. results the clinical and paraclinical characteristics of our three patients are summarized in table 1 .
patients were aged between 17 and 65 .
all patients had no previous cancer history and arrived to our centers after several neurologic evaluations .
clinical presentation included diffuse and / or multifocal neurological signs and symptoms : headache , nausea and / or vomiting , monoparesis , and cranial nerve palsies .
one patient ( patient 3 ) presented recurrent isolated confusional episodes but was completely asymptomatic in between .
electroencephalogram showed bilateral / diffuse slow abnormalities without epileptic activity in all cases .
brain mri performed within the first 4 weeks from symptom onset was normal in both patients in whom it was acquired ( pt 1 and 3 ) .
alternatively , focal or diffuse nodular enhancement of leptomeninges and cranial nerves was documented ( figure 1 ) .
spine mri revealed nodular contrast enhancement of meninges , conus , and cauda , suggesting neoplastic infiltration ( figure 2 ) .
cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) analysis showed severe blood - csf barrier ( b - csf b ) damage in all patients but inconstant pleocytosis .
in patient 2 , despite repeated lumbar punctures , csf cytology remained negative and diagnosis was confirmed on leptomeningeal tissue obtained from biopsy .
in all other patients , the presence of melanoma cells in the csf ( figures 3 and 4 ) was eventually documented by means of repeated lumbar punctures .
after the diagnosis of meningeal melanomatosis was confirmed , all patients underwent a chest - abdomen ct scan and a dermatological and an ophthalmological assessment .
in two patients , the final diagnosis was of probable primary leptomeningeal melanomatosis ( pt 1 and 2 ) , while in patient 3 a cutaneous melanoma of right eyelid was documented .
the diagnostic delay was remarkable in our series , with a median delay of 32 weeks from symptom onset ( range : 17 - 47 weeks ) .
prognosis was dismal , with a median survival of 4.14 weeks from diagnosis ( range : 2 - 6.29 weeks ) .
4. discussion although restricted , our series offers several insights into the diagnosis of neoplastic meningitis in naive patients .
these patients , without a previous cancer history , can present with diffuse / multifocal clinical signs and symptoms and represent a real diagnostic challenge .
on these grounds , we propose an algorithm ( figure 5 ) to guide the clinician in the complex process of differential diagnosis , regarding as opening scenario a naif patient presenting with subacute headache and / or encephalopathy plus one or more focal signs , and negative or inconclusive mri , as we have observed in our series .
in this setting , csf analysis should be promptly performed to exclude other dysimmune / infectious disorders such as autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitides , primary cns vasculitis , and chronic infectious meningitis , which can course without mri alterations .
besides , it is important to consider that a delay in the diagnosis of the above - mentioned conditions may strongly affect final outcome and long - term sequelae .
furthermore , even when the diagnosis of neoplastic meningitis has been suspected , paraclinical findings could be inconclusive .
according to the literature , brain mri has an estimated sensitivity of 40 - 60 % in demonstrating meningeal neoplastic infiltration [ 1 , 6 , 7 ] , but data correlating sensitivity of mri to the timing of its execution are currently unavailable .
in our series , brain mri performed within the first month from onset was normal despite the clinical pattern was dominated by cerebral involvement .
in the absence of meningeal contrast enhancement , dilation of the ventricular system or reduction of subarachnoid sulci may be indirect signs of neoplastic meningitis and should be valued in all cases .
csf analysis , which was performed with remarkable delay in our series , showed a significant protein increase due to severe b - csf b damage in all patients .
noteworthy , despite the delay and repeated sampling , in patient 2 csf results were inconclusive for the detection of neoplastic cells , leading to performing a meningeal biopsy .
interestingly , csf cytology can be persistently negative even in the presence of disseminated cranial and spinal disease on mri .
these data are consistent with current evidence that malignant cells are detected in the csf in 50 - 70 % of patients with neoplastic meningitis by initial lumbar puncture [ 1 , 8 , 9 ] , a rate that increases with repeated sampling .
in the case of normal or inconclusive csf findings , a spine mri may be helpful to demonstrate meningeal infiltration of cauda roots , even in the absence of spinal symptoms .
overall , diagnostic difficulties resulted in a dramatic diagnostic delay , ranging from 17 to 47 weeks after clinical onset .
these data are remarkable considering the poor short - term prognosis of these patients [ 10 ] , who could access only palliative or even no treatment .
in conclusion , the difficulty in both posing the clinical suspicion and confirming the diagnosis of neoplastic meningitis contributed to the sharp diagnostic delay observed in our series .
early recognition is fundamental to make differential diagnosis and start appropriate therapies .
thus , improving the handle of these patients and the current diagnostic algorithms for neoplastic meningitis is of capital importance to offer them appropriate treatments .

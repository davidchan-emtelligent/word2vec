background previous australian research has highlighted disparities in community perceptions of the threat posed by terrorism .
a study with a large sample size is needed to examine reported concerns and anticipated responses of community sub - groups and to determine their consistency with existing australian and international findings .
methods representative samples of new south wales ( nsw ) adults completed terrorism perception questions as part of computer assisted telephone interviews ( cati ) in 2007 ( n = 2081 ) and 2010 ( n = 2038 ) .
responses were weighted against the nsw population .
data sets from the two surveys were pooled and multivariate multilevel analyses conducted to identify health and socio - demographic factors associated with higher perceived risk of terrorism and evacuation response intentions , and to examine changes over time .
results in comparison with 2007 , australians in 2010 were significantly more likely to believe that a terrorist attack would occur in australia ( adjusted odd ratios ( aor ) = 1.24 , 95 % ci : 1.06 - 1.45 ) but felt less concerned that they would be directly affected by such an incident ( aor = 0.65 , 95 % ci : 0.55 - 0.75 ) .
higher perceived risk of terrorism and related changes in living were associated with middle age , female gender , lower education and higher reported psychological distress .
australians of migrant background reported significantly lower likelihood of terrorism ( aor = 0.52 , 95 % ci : 0.39 - 0.70 ) but significantly higher concern that they would be personally affected by such an incident ( aor = 1.57 , 95 % ci : 1.21 - 2.04 ) and having made changes in the way they live due to this threat ( aor = 2.47 , 95 % ci : 1.88 - 3.25 ) .
willingness to evacuate homes and public places in response to potential incidents increased significantly between 2007 and 2010 ( aor = 1.53 , 95 % ci : 1.33 - 1.76 ) .
conclusion while an increased proportion of australians believe that the national threat of terrorism remains high , concern about being personally affected has moderated and may reflect habituation to this threat .
key sub - groups remain disproportionately concerned , notably those with lower education and migrant groups .
the dissonance observed in findings relating to australians of migrant background appears to reflect wider socio - cultural concerns associated with this issue .
disparities in community concerns regarding terrorism - related threat require active policy consideration and specific initiatives to reduce the vulnerabilities of known risk groups , particularly in the aftermath of future incidents .
terrorism threat perception habituation ethnicity education psychological distress background terrorism affects populations primarily through the threat of its occurrence .
while those directly exposed may suffer profound physical and psychological effects , the conveyed imagery of such incidents is intended to undermine the working assumptions of a populace : safety in public places , during routine travel and the predictability of risk [ 1 ] .
understanding population effects and those sub - groups with potentially greater vulnerability are critical elements of a comprehensive counter - terrorism strategy [ 1,2 ] .
a principal reason terrorism is effective at the societal level is that it draws together two key elements known to inflate risk estimates ; ' dread risk ' , which involves threats seen as catastrophic , uncontrollable and arbitrary in their impacts , and the ' unknown risk ' of hazards that may not be observable or where the mechanism of injury is unfamiliar [ 3 ] .
threats with such features are typically overestimated in terms of their probability and risk of personal harm , and may generalise well beyond their regions of known occurrence [ 4 ] .
national surveys after the september 11 attacks showed that around half of the u.s. adult population felt that they or their family were at personal risk of harm in a terrorist attack [ 5,6 ] .
perceived threat is a factor of interest to public health and emergency planners , as it plays a key role in motivating individuals to engage in appropriate protective behaviours , including terrorism - related responses [ 7,8 ] .
at the same time , exaggerated personal fears can also have adverse health and socio - economic effects , including movement restrictions , avoidance of transport modes , substance abuse and community conflict [ 9 - 12 ] .
specific demographic groups have been found to experience particular vulnerability to terrorism - related threats .
although males and members of majority ethnic groups commonly report limited perceived risk and post - incident functional impacts ( the so - called ' white male effect ') , meta - analyses show that middle age , female gender and ethnic minority status are factors associated with greater impacts following both natural disasters and terrorist incidents [ 13 ] .
studies following september 11 and the london 2005 transport bombings identified similar risk groups [ 9,14 ] .
in countries such as canada and australia , which have experienced relatively little domestic terrorism , there is evidence of similar vulnerabilities within these populations [ 15 - 17 ] .
australian research in 2007 identified high levels of concern and changes in living particularly among those of ethnic minority status [ 16 ] .
moreover , the specific pattern of results was suggestive of perceived secondary threats within the general community , rather than the direct risks of terrorist incidents per se. while it is important to understand population effects after a major terrorist incident , communities with histories of lower exposure but high notional risk also warrant research attention .
commenting on canadian research , lee et al [ 2 ] argue that information about the way individuals perceive and respond to such threats , prior to their occurrence , can be used in the development of strategies aimed at preparing for terrorism .
such initiatives , they argue , represent a valuable shift from reactive to proactive emergency management .
in this vein , australian population data were gathered in 2007 as part of a surveillance process similar to those occurring in other countries [ 8 ] .
the aim of this study is to use pooled data from surveys conducted in 2007 and 2010 to determine socio - demographic and health factors associated with higher perceived risk of terrorism and evacuation response intentions , and to examine changes over time .
methods a search of existing survey instruments identified a canadian study on terrorism perceptions and anticipated responses , which was used as a primary reference for the current survey [ 15 ] .
questions on threat likelihood , concern for self / family , and protective behaviours ( i.e. willingness to comply with evacuation requests ) were adapted , with permission , by the current authors .
perceived likelihood and vulnerability / concern are commonly used indicators of ' threat perception ' ( i.e. serious and likely threat to health ) and have been shown to predict the adoption of a range of health protective behaviours [ 7,8 ] .
all survey protocols and procedures were approved by the university of western sydney ethics committee ( protocol no. h7143 ) .
the first survey was conducted as part of the new south wales population health survey between 22 january and 31 march 2007 .
the second was administered as a stand - alone survey between 29 october 2009 and 20 february 2010 .
both surveys were conducted at the nsw health survey program using a computer assisted telephone interview ( cati ) system [ 18 ] .
the target population for both surveys was all residents aged 16 years and over , living in nsw and stratified by geographical region .
details of the validation of the original question set and its cati administration have been previously reported [ 19 ] .
measurements a five question module was developed for the 2007 survey to measure terrorism threat perception variables and willingness to evacuate [ 17 ] .
these same five items were also used as outcome variables in the 2010 survey .
as the field test data had indicated high assumed knowledge regarding the concept of terrorism and presumptions this typically involved bombings or shootings ( i.e. ' conventional ' terrorism ) , a specific definition of terrorism was not outlined in the survey preamble .
threat perception and response intentions were measured on a five - point likert scale from 1 (' not at all ') to 5 (' extremely ') .
the response categories were dichotomised into the indicators of interest ( e.g. ' high concern ') to address the research questions pertaining to high risk perception and response intentions .
responses of " do n't know " and refused were excluded .
in relation to the four hypothetical questions ( i.e. perceived likelihood of a terrorist attack in australia ; concern that self or family would be directly affected ; willingness to comply with evacuation of home ; willingness to comply with evacuation of workplace or public facility ) , the two upper responses of ' very ' and ' extremely ' were combined to form the indicators of interest ( e.g. high concern ) .
for the non - hypothetical , behavioural question " how much have you changed the way you live your life because of the possibility of a terrorist attack " , the responses ' a little ' , ' moderately ' , ' very much ' and ' extremely ' were combined into the indicator of interest ; ' changed living ' .
the socio - demographic factors that were examined for their associations with threat perception and willingness to evacuate were : age , marital status ; children under 16 years of age living in household ; residential location ( urban or rural , as determined by area health authority ) ; being born in australia ; speaking a language other than english at home ( lote ) ; highest educational qualification , employment status and pre - tax household income .
the threat perception and intention variables were also assessed against current physical and psychological wellbeing , specifically ; self - rated health status and current psychological distress , as measured by the 10 - item kessler psychological distress scale ( k10 ) .
scores on the k10 range from 10 - 50 , with >= 22 being considered ' high ' psychological distress [ 20 ] .
statistical analysis the data from both surveys were weighted to be representative of the target population and to adjust for probability of selection and differing non - response rates among males and females and different age groups , and in a manner consistent with established nsw health population health survey program methodology [ 21 ] .
the data sets have also been shown to be representative of the national population in terms of its key demographic characteristics and this comparison has been previously reported [ 19 ] .
however , the potential for differences in terrorism threat perceptions to be geographically - driven means that it would not be appropriate to generalise these findings to all australian states .
data analysis was performed using the " svy " commands of stata version 10.0 ( stata corp , college station , tx , usa ) , which allowed for adjustments for sampling weights .
the taylor series linearization method was used in the surveys when estimating confidence intervals around prevalence estimates .
a chi - squared test was used to test the significance of associations .
the 2007 and 2010 data were combined into a single data set .
a logistic regression generalised linear latent and mixed models ( gllamm ) analysis , [ 22 ] which adjusts for the effect of clustering ( local government areas ) , was conducted using a stepwise backwards method in order to determine the independent variables ( socio - demographic and health factors ) significantly associated with the terrorism threat perception and response intent variables .
potential confounders were adjusted for as part of the analysis , with these consisting of all the independent variables previously noted .
also adjusted for as part of the evacuation analysis were the two threat perception variables ( likelihood and concern ) .
these were included as independent variables in this analysis in order to specifically explore these associations .
the odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated in order to assess the adjusted risk of the independent variables , and those with p < 0.05 were retained in the final model .
results the samples for the 2007 and 2010 surveys were 2,081 and 2,038 respectively , yielding a total sample of 4,119 respondents for the pooled analysis .
the survey response rates were determined in accordance with nsw health survey methodology and calculated as total completed interviews of eligible participants , divided by the combined total of completed interviews and refusals [ 18 ] .
for the 2007 survey a total of 17,439 call attempts were made , yielding 3,372 eligible participants ( 2,081 completions and 1,191 refusals ) and a response rate of 63.6 % .
the 2010 survey involved 18,300 call attempts , which yielded 3548 eligible participants ( 2,038 completions and 1510 refusals ) and a response rate of 57.4 % .
results of the 2010 survey showed that 32.5 % of the population thought a terrorist attack was very or extremely likely in australia , 38.4 % were very or extremely concerned that they or their family could be directly affected by such an incident and 27.1 % had made some ( small to extreme ) level of change to the way they lived their life in response to the perceived risk of a terrorist incident .
these findings compared with prevalence rates in the 2007 survey of 30.3 % , 42.5 % and 26.4 % respectively .
high willingness to evacuate from a home or a workplace / public facility in the context of a potential terrorist threat was reported by 75.0 % and 88.0 % of respondents respectively in the 2010 survey and 67.4 % and 85.2 % in the 2007 survey. with regard to the threat perception ( likelihood , concern ) and changed living factors , concern showed the greatest change over the two surveys .
when examined by educational category , figure 1 shows that the prevalence of reported high concern was lower across all categories in 2010 compared to 2007 , with greater reductions occurring for respondents with the lowest levels of formal education .
figure 1 prevalence of high concern for self and family by educational status in 2007 and 2010 .
the results of the multivariate analysis for the threat perception / changed living factors are presented in table 1 .
these results show that in comparison with 2007 , australians in 2010 were significantly more likely to believe that a terrorist attack would occur in australia ( aor = 1.24 , p = 0.008 ) but felt less concerned that they would be directly affected by such an incident ( aor = 0.65 , p < 0.001 ) .

in relation to the demographic variables , australians with no formal educational qualifications were significantly more likely ( aor = 2.25 , p < 0.001 ) to report that they perceived a terrorist attack as being very / extremely likely to occur , compared to those with university level qualifications ; as were middle aged respondents ( 45 - 54 years ) compared to young people ( 16 - 24 years ) ( aor = 2.89 , p < 0.001 ) .
respondents who spoke a language other than english at home ( lote ) were significantly less likely to report a terrorist attack as being very / extremely likely to occur ( aor = 0.52 , p < 0.001 ) .
the adjusted odd ratios for lote respondents regarding threat perception and changed living are presented in figure 2 .
figure 2 adjusted odd ratios of terrorism likely , concern and changed living by primary language group .
people living in urban areas were significantly more likely to be very / extremely concerned that they or their family would be directly affected in the event of a terrorist attack ( aor = 0.66 , p < 0.001 ) as were : females ( aor = 1.77 , p < 0.001 ) ; those with no formal educational qualifications , compared to those with university qualifications ( aor = 2.95 , p < 0.001 ) and lote respondents ( aor = 1.57 , p < 0.001 ) .
australians who spoke a language other than english at home were significantly more likely to report having made changes in the way they lived due to the possibility of terrorism ( aor = 2.47 , p < 0.001 ) .
other positive predictors of this indicator were female gender ( aor = 1.31 , p = 0.004 ) and urban residency ( aor = 0.83 , p = 0.054 ) .
respondents with poor self - rated health were significantly less likely to have changed their way of living due to concerns about terrorism ( aor = 0.78 , p = 0.033 ). with regards to the physical and psychological health status variables , positive findings within the multivariate analysis were observed only in relation to the latter item .
high psychological distress was associated with high perceived terrorism likelihood ( aor = 1.46 , p < 0.001 ) , high concern that self or family would be directly affected by an attack ( aor = 1.63 , p < 0.001 ) and higher likelihood of having made some changes in living due to this threat ( aor = 1.70 , p < 0.001 ) .
the results of the protective behaviours analysis are presented in table 2 and show that , compared with 2007 , australians in 2010 were significantly more likely ( aor = 1.54 , p < 0.001 ) to report being very / extremely willing to evacuate their home during a terrorism related emergency .
this was also the case for the combined home / work place or public facility indicator ( aor = 1.53 , p < 0.001 ) .

values range from 10 - 50 , with >= 22 considered ' high ' psychological distress .
those without formal educational qualifications were significantly more likely to report high willingness to evacuate public facilities ( aor = 2.45 , p < 0.001 ) .
females reported higher willingness with both single indicators and the combined indicator ( aor = 1.36 , p < 0.001 ) .
being over 75 years of age was associated with significantly lower willingness on all indicators ( combined indicator aor = 0.39 , p < 0.001 ) , while those aged 65 - 74 years reported lower willingness regarding home evacuation and the combined indicator ( aor = 0.64 , p = 0.008 ) .
lote respondents reported significantly lower willingness to evacuate public facilities ( aor = 0.52 , p < 0.001 ) .
the two threat perception variables ( likelihood and concern respectively ) were associated with evacuation intent in all categories , these being : home evacuation ( aor = 1.29 , p = 0.002 ) ( aor = 1.79 , p < 0.001 ) , offices or public facilities ( aor = 1.94 , p < 0.001 ) ( aor = 1.85 , p < 0.001 ) and the combined indicator ( aor = 1.36 , p < 0.001 ) ( aor = 1.75 , p < 0.001 ) .
overall , concern for self and family was more strongly associated with evacuation intent than was perceived likelihood of terrorism .
discussion the current results indicate that between 2007 and 2010 there has been a small but significant increase in the perceived likelihood that a terrorist incident will occur in australia .
at around one third of the population perceiving high likelihood of an attack , these findings are consistent with results from the 2007 australian survey of social attitudes ( 34.8 %) but lower than rates observed in the australian wellbeing survey [ 23,24 ] .
the latter survey series showed perceived likelihood peaked and then declined after both the 2002 and 2005 bali bombings , probably the two most significant terrorist incidents to have directly affected australians .
the latter reduction occurred at a faster rate , leading the authors to conclude that the initial incident exposure had supported community adaptation to the subsequent event .
the specific pattern of the current findings ; reduction in personal concern / vulnerability against a small rise in likelihood , also suggests a general habituation to this threat has occurred over the 2007 - 2010 period .
as the 2010 survey was conducted over the more extended period of four months , it was necessary to test for potential time effects that may have affected those findings .
while no attacks directly affecting australians occurred during either survey , the widely reported ' underwear bomber ' incident occurred on a chicago - bound plane on december 25 , 2009 .
this was the midpoint of the second survey and a high period of travel during the australian summer holiday season .
there was sufficient statistical power to examine survey response by month and this analysis confirmed that there were no significant differences , by month , in relation to perceived likelihood ( p = 0.263 ) , concern ( p = 0.625 ) or living changes ( p = 0.5 ) .
while habituation to terrorism threat has been reported in relation to ongoing political violence in israel [ 25,26 ] and after large - scale single incidents [ 14 ] , the current findings indicate that similar processes may occur within populations which have had limited direct exposure .
this tendency for individuals to adapt to stressors over time and return to ' baseline ' arousal is an increasingly recognised element of community recovery and resilience processes .
moreover , these functional ' trajectories' may be optimised ( e.g. pre - emptive community education / resilience programs ) or potentially undermined [ 27 ] .
for example , tucker suggests that post 9 / 11 media and government messaging about threats may have impeded habituation by providing constant fear - based reminders [ 28 ] .
conversely , effective terrorism risk communication may help the public to regain its ' basal security ' by clearly explaining the nature of the threat , its likelihood and current management , and addressing its unknown / dreaded aspects [ 29 ] .
achieving this lower state of arousal means that subsequent threat information is likely to be assessed in qualitatively different ways , which are more likely to promote adaptive outcomes ( e.g. reduced avoidance behaviours ) [ 4 ] .
contextual factors may also be important mediators of habituation .
this may be seen in the current finding that urban residents were significantly less likely than rural residents to report high perceived incident likelihood , despite a dominant worldwide trend towards urban forms of terrorism .
goodwin et al [ 30 ] found that those living in urban london reported lower perceived likelihood of attack than those in suburban and rural areas , a process they suggest is related to cognitive dissonance ( i.e. minimising the clash arising from the desire for safety and the simultaneous choice of a ' high risk ' habitat ) .
while such factors may promote habituation , it is also important to consider whether the currently observed reductions in concern represent adaptive or more maladaptive forms of habituation ( e.g. perceived invulnerability in the absence of attacks ) .
importantly , co - occurring increases in terrorism likelihood and evacuation willingness suggest that lower reported concern , in this context , does not equate with complacency and that the public could be readily mobilised were alert levels to increase .
the period between the 2007 and 2010 surveys was marked by several terrorism - related incidents that received wide media coverage in australia .
these included the mumbai attacks and the 2008 trial of twelve ' home - grown ' terrorists who had planned the bombing of major sporting complexes in melbourne .
in july and august 2009 , the period prior to the second survey , there was also reporting of the jakarta hotel bombing and the uncovered plot to attack the holsworthy army barracks in sydney .
it is likely that coverage of these incidents has maintained terrorism as a ' front of mind ' threat within the australian population , possibly keeping the perceived likelihood of an incident relatively steady during this period .
despite such awareness , only about one quarter of respondents reported any discernable change in the way they live due to this threat ; a rate similar to that observed in u.s. population surveys [ 31 ] .
the observed reduction in level of concern for self or family may be due to a number of factors .
one possibility is that through an increased awareness of ' real ' terrorist plots within australia , respondents may have realised that they or their family would not have been directly impacted , thus altering their appraisal of the personal risks of such events .
the specific nature of recent threats may have also been a factor , that is , gun - related sieges typified by the 2008 mumbai attacks and the planned holsworthy assault .
incidents of this kind may actually be more culturally ' familiar ' than other scenarios ( e.g. co - ordinated suicide bombings , chemical attacks ) and provide clearer reference points against which people can assess their own vulnerability [ 4 ] .
this may have been a contributing factor in the large reported increases in evacuation willingness between the 2007 and 2010 surveys .
paradoxically , such threats may also lack the dread and high - novelty elements known to inflate personal risk estimates , [ 3 ] thereby contributing to reduced levels of concern .
the pooled analysis highlights that middle age , female gender and lower education ; demographic factors identified with higher perceived terrorism risk in post incident settings , [ 5,8,9 ] are also common to western settings outside that event context .
this information can assist public health and emergency planners in these latter settings as these potential ' lead ' groups may engage more readily with risk communication initiatives , including appropriate vigilance raising and alerts .
female respondents may be an important case in point .
while gender is a commonly identified ' risk factor ' in the threat perception literature , the current results show that there is not an undifferentiated bias in females' reports i.e. they do not perceive terrorism as more likely but do report greater concern .
as such , women may see the ' reality ' of this risk in much the same way as men but also experience greater concern for people in general , irrespective of the threat source .
counter to interpretations which tend to invoke traditional gender models , [ 32 ] these findings highlight that women could be easier to engage and may be more effective allies in terrorism risk mitigation efforts .
younger people ( 16 - 24 years ) routinely show lower levels of threat perception ( i.e. incident likelihood and concern ) .
while a potential positive in itself , preparedness for any heightened threat may warrant dedicated risk messaging for this group , including the possible use of social media platforms [ 33 ] .
an inverse correlation was also observed between reported concern and level of education ( figure 1 ) .
similar previous findings have been interpreted as reflecting education - related appraisal capacities or , alternatively , the associated availability of financial or other resources that may ' buffer ' against potential threat [ 16 ] .
while education is a factor of known importance in the risk communication field generally [ 4 ] it has received little detailed analysis as an element of terrorism preparedness .
in this vein , it is notable that those with the greatest reduction in concern between 2007 and 2010 were those with the lowest levels of formal education .
a notable finding was that lote respondents reported significantly lower levels of terrorism likelihood , but significantly higher levels of concern and perceived changes in the way they lived due to terrorism threat .
while this pattern in the pooled results is broadly consistent with the 2007 findings [ 16 ] , the pooled analysis highlights a greater dissonance in relation to these variables ( figure 2 ) .
as noted with female respondents , this may similarly reflect a higher concern for family and others in general , possibly associated with cultural and out - group bonding processes [ 16 ] .
a further interpretation may be that heightened community anxiety about terrorism could be associated with increased marginalisation of visible minority groups .
for such groups , it is possible that wider societal reactions represent a more pervasive threat to their wellbeing than potential terrorist acts .
in terrorism affected countries , culture , appearance and religion have been found to be strong predictors of terrorism - related distress and appear to reflect increased stigmatisation of these groups [ 9 ] .
while it must be seen that lote represents a broad indicator within the current study , this pattern of results could similarly reflect social ' splintering ' around this issue within australia [ 34 ] .
this is consistent with qualitative research with minority groups highlighting perceptions that terrorism issues are frequently used as a rationale for cultural / religious and race - related harassment by members of the wider australian community .
this is particularly the case after specific incidents have occurred [ 12 ] .
while those of arab and muslim background have been disproportionately affected , vilification of other ethnic and religious groups has also been documented [ 12 ] .
such findings present significant social policy challenges regarding the effective promotion of cultural tolerance and social inclusion ; including the nature and timing of specific initiatives [ 35 ] .
while these are important outcomes in their own right , there is growing awareness that actively increasing social engagement may also be a key counter - terrorism strategy ; since such environments may be less conducive to the radicalisation of vulnerable individuals [ 35,36 ] .
the consistent association between psychological distress and terrorism likelihood / concern was not observed in the 2007 study and appears to indicate a broad increase in perceived terrorism threat within this sub - group .
this may be due to the frequency or particular nature of more recent incidents coupled with a greater sensitivity to them .
australian research has shown that strong belief in the likelihood of an attack is associated with low personal wellbeing and suggests that , for such groups , the practice of issuing ' blanket alerts' may be counter - productive [ 24 ] .
conversely , there is evidence that experimentally induced mood ( i.e. fear ) increases terrorism risk estimates and motivation towards protective behaviours , [ 37 ] albeit this may represent a qualitatively different mood state and context .
in the current analysis for example , higher distress was not associated with higher evacuation intent and may indicate a more complex interaction between negative affect and safety appraisals in these scenarios .
the willingness of respondents to evacuate from their homes during a potential terrorist incident was significantly higher in 2010 compared to 2007 .
this was not the case for evacuation relating to offices / public facilities , although this may be due to a ceiling effect in the earlier study ( i.e. 85 % reported high compliance ) .
consistent with health protection motivation theories , higher perceived incident likelihood and concern were associated with higher evacuation intent in all categories [ 7 ] .
this supports the limited available evidence for this relationship in post incident settings [ 8 ] , while also showing that it is not limited to these contexts .
the finding that concern for others was a stronger predictor of intent than was likelihood also highlights the potential value of a new approach to risk communication in this area ; one that engages people around the protection of loved ones and others , rather than fear of terrorism occurrence per se [ 15 ] .
the increased willingness regarding home evacuation is somewhat unusual in that people typically show greater reluctance to leave their homes during threatened emergencies [ 38 ] .
this result may be due to a stronger perception during the second survey period that scenarios warranting such evacuations could realistically occur .
as noted , there has been wide - spread coverage of terrorism - related activity during this period , including the deaths of australians during the jakarta and mumbai incidents .
the latter was a protracted urban assault that received intense coverage and was notable for its ' low tech ' but highly disruptive method .
it has been argued that qualitatively different incidents like this may have ' signal potential ' in that they can promote widespread changes in perceptions and specific protective behaviours [ 39 ] .
limitations the current study has several limitations .
while the 2007 and 2010 survey response rates of 63.6 % and 57.4 % respectively compare favourably with similar population surveys , [ 9 ] they had the potential to introduce a response bias in relation to the current results .
as noted , this was addressed by introducing weightings to adjust for probability of selection and for differing non - response rates among males and females and different age groups .
while nsw residents make up around one third of the australian population and the weighted nsw sample is consistent with national population demographics , [ 19 ] potential regional variations in terrorism threat perception mean that the current findings cannot be generalised to all australian states .
the aim of this study is to determine socio - demographic and health factors associated with terrorism threat perception and response intentions using a large , pooled data set .
while the sample size is a strength of this study , its repeated cross - sectional design captures only a snapshot view of these frequencies at two different time points and no firm conclusions can be made regarding causes .
the current findings raise important questions regarding demographic groups with potentially greater vulnerability , particularly during periods of heightened perceived threat and in the aftermath of possible future incidents .
qualitative research being conducted by the current authors will provide further insight into the underlying issues affecting these outcomes , and whether these have implications for social policy and incident response planning .
conclusion the current findings appear to show a pattern of population - level habituation to the threat of terrorism in australia during the study period 2007 - 2010 .
rather than simply reflecting reduced preoccupation over time , the pattern of findings suggest an increased appreciation of specific risk scenarios , including the relative risks that individuals may face .
key demographic groups remain disproportionately concerned , notably migrant groups and those with lower education .
the dissonance observed in pooled findings regarding australians of migrant background was more pronounced than in our earlier analysis .
it is also consistent with qualitative data showing wider socio - cultural concerns associated with this issue .
amid recent challenges in australia to the ethos of multiculturalism , public messaging that supports cultural diversity may also play an important role in reducing specific community discord that has centred on terrorism fears .

background and purpose patients with fracture of the proximal femur often undergo blood transfusion .
a pneumatic compression bandage has been shown to reduce transfusion after primary hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis .
in this randomized trial , we evaluated the efficacy of this bandage following surgery for hip fracture .
patients and methods 288 patients , 50 years or older with 292 fractured hips treated with hemiarthroplasty or internal fixation ( except pinning ) , were randomized to an experimental group with pneumatic wound compression applied after surgery ( n = 138 ) and a control group with the same dressing but no compression ( n = 154 ) .
transfusion threshold was blood hemoglobin below 100 g / l. the primary outcome measures were the number of blood units and the proportion of patients transfused after surgery .
results the primary outcome measures were similar in both groups .
the mean number of postoperatively transfused blood units was 1.3 in the compression group and 1.1 in the non - compression group .
blood transfusion was given to 84 patients ( 62 %) in the compression group and to 85 patients ( 55 %) in the non - compression group .
interpretation pneumatic wound compression does not reduce the need for transfusion after hip fracture surgery .
introduction bleeding from a hip fracture caused by the injury itself and by the subsequent surgery often necessitates blood transfusion .
to reduce bleeding during and after major orthopedic surgery , such as hip and knee arthroplasty , various methods ( mainly pharmaceutical ) have been investigated ( keating and meding 2002 , moonen et al. 2006 ) .
a pneumatic wound compression bandage has been introduced as a new method to reduce postoperative bleeding after hip arthroplasty ( hornberg et al. 2002 ) .
it was evaluated and found to reduce the amount of blood transfusion in two small randomized studies on primary total hip arthroplasty ( tha ) for hip osteoarthritis ( oa ) ( hornberg et al. 2002 , johansson et al. 2005a ) .
we have not found any published studies that used this pneumatic compression bandage in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture .
the primary objective of this randomized controlled trial was therefore to assess the efficacy of the pneumatic compression bandage , applied immediately after hip fracture surgery , in reducing the need for blood transfusion .
patients and methods patients were recruited at the emergency department of kristianstad hospital , sweden , from january 2005 through december 2006 .
the department provides emergency care for a region with a population of 170,000 .
patients with a femoral neck fracture , or pertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture were screened by an orthopedic surgeon for enrollment in the trial .
those who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were asked to participate .
written informed consent was obtained from all participating patients .
for patients who could not provide consent themselves because of cognitive impairment , the orthopedic surgeon or the ward nurse sought consent from a family member .
eligibility criteria the inclusion criteria were patients 50 years or older presenting with : ( 1 ) displaced cervical femoral fracture planned for surgery with hemiarthroplasty , ( 2 ) stable pertrochanteric fracture planned for internal fixation with plate and sliding screw or twin hook , or ( 3 ) unstable pertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture planned for internal fixation with proximal intramedullary nail .
intracapsular femoral neck fractures treated with pinning seldom require transfusion , and they were therefore not included in our study .
the exclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) undisplaced cervical fracture , ( 2 ) displaced cervical fracture planned for fixation with hook pins ( usually in patients below 75 years of age ) , ( 3 ) pathologic fracture due to malignancy , ( 4 ) concomitant fractures or injuries that might require blood transfusion , and ( 5 ) refusal to undergo blood transfusion ( such as jehovah 's witnesses ) .
during the study period , 745 consecutive patients with proximal femoral fracture were registered at the emergency department. of 333 patients assessed for eligibility , 288 patients with 292 hip fractures met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study ; 138 were randomized to the compression group and 154 to the non - compression group .
surgical procedures all patients received an intravenous injection of tranexamic acid ( 100 mg / kg body weight ) 20 min preoperatively , and a second injection after 4 h. all patients were operated on with general or spinal anesthesia .
for hemiarthroplasty , the lubinus sp ii variokopf ( link , hamburg , germany ) or the exeter uhr ( stryker howmedica osteonics , exeter , uk ) was used .
for internal fixation of stable pertrochanteric fractures , the hansson twin - hook hip fracture system ( swemac orthopaedics ab , linkoping , sweden ) or the ambi / classic compression hip screw system ( smith and nephew , memphis , tn ) was used .
for unstable pertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures , the gamma intramedullary nail system ( stryker orthopedics , mahwa , nj ) was used .
the patient was operated upon on a fracture table with longitudinal traction ( internal fixation ) or in a lateral decubitus position with a dorsolateral approach without trochanter osteotomy ( hemiarthroplasty ) .
no drain was used .
a single dose of cloxacillin ( 2 g intravenously ) was given shortly before operation ( 600 mg clindamycin in case of allergy to penicillin ) .
after wound closure , a small dressing was placed over the wound .
randomization ( flow chart ) a randomization list was created based on a computer - generated random number list .
based on the list , consecutively numbered sealed , opaque envelopes were prepared .
patients were randomized into 2 groups : an intervention group wearing the bandage with pneumatic pressure applied and a control group wearing the bandage but without pressure .
randomization of group assignment was done immediately after surgery by opening the lowest - numbered envelope .
sample size a previous study of 50 patients who had undergone tha for oa showed a statistically significant difference of 23 % fewer transfused patients and 65 % less transfused blood units in the compression group compared with the non - compression group ( mean 0.6 units and 1.8 units , respectively , no sds reported ) ( hornberg et al. 2002 ) .
in a similar study , the mean number of transfused units was 1.4 ( sd 1.5 ) in the compression group and 2 ( sd 2 ) in the non - compression group ( johansson et al. 2005a ) .
assuming an sd of 1.5 , randomization of 280 patients would provide 80 % power at a 5 % 2 - sided significance level to detect differences of at least 0.5 transfused blood units between the experimental and control groups .
this sample size would also allow detection of a difference of at least 20 % in the proportion of transfused patients ( assuming a 70 % transfusion rate in the control group ) .
the compression bandage .
bandage the pneumatic compression bandage , calmed compression dressing system ( calmar medical ab , askim , sweden ) , was applied when the patient was being moved from the operation table to a bed .
the bandage consists of a garment placed around the hip region and an inflatable bag placed directly over the postoperative dressing on the surgical incision ( figure ) .
in patients randomized to the compression group , air was pumped into the bag .
the initial pressure of 40 mm hg was maintained for 30 min , after which the pressure was lowered to 20 mm hg and kept for 12 h. in patients randomized to the control group , the bandage was applied in an identical manner but the bag was not inflated .
postoperative care the postoperative care followed routine clinical care .
a daily subcutaneous injection of 40 mg enoxaparin was given for 10 days .
early mobilization with weight bearing as tolerated was allowed from the first postoperative day .
transfusion a transfusion of 1 red cell unit was given when blood hemoglobin ( hb ) was below 100 g / l , and repeated when necessary using the same threshold .
assessments at baseline , data concerning preoperative use of medication with antithrombotic effect , including warfarin , acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) , or other anti - platelet drugs or non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , were recorded .
time from arrival at the emergency department to surgery was recorded .
blood hb , platelet count , international normalized ratio ( inr ) , and activated partial thromboplastin time ( apt - t ) were measured at admission .
blood hb was routinely measured 3 h after surgery and on postoperative days 1 and 5 .
further hb measurements were made on clinical suspicion of low hb , if the hb value was close to the transfusion threshold , or if blood had been transfused .
intraoperative blood loss was estimated by the nurse anesthetist by counting wet swabs and drapes together with suction volume minus volume of any irrigation fluid used .
the number of red cell units transfused before , during , and after surgery ( up to discharge from hospital or death ) was recorded .
potential complications related to the bandage - - including pressure ulcers , deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism , and wound complications ( delayed healing , necrosis , rupture or infection ) - - were recorded up to 3 months after surgery .
the dressing was inspected daily by ward nurse assistants and the surgical wound was routinely inspected on day 5 , on the day of discharge , and when the sutures were removed 2 weeks postoperatively .
data for all treated infections or positive cultures up to three months postoperatively were recorded by a nurse in a centralized hospital database .
pre - existing or new pressure ulcers were looked for and documented daily by ward nurse assistants on a special form .
clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis was examined with venography or ultrasound , and pulmonary embolism with spiral computerized tomography of the chest .
the compression bandage .
outcome measures the primary outcome measure was the mean number of red cell units transfused postoperatively and the proportion of patients in each group requiring postoperative blood transfusion .
the secondary outcome measure was the rate of postoperative complications .
ethics the study was approved by the medical research ethics committee of lund university ( 704 / 2004 - 11 - 30 ) .
statistics intention - to - treat analyses were performed .
the mean difference and 95 % ci in number of postoperatively transfused blood units was compared between the 2 groups using the independent - samples t - test .
difference between the 2 groups in the proportion of postoperatively transfused patients was analyzed using a logistic regression .
analyses adjusting for age , sex , use of drugs with antithrombotic effect and nsaids , baseline hemoglobin , type of surgery , number of blood units transfused before and / or during surgery , and amount of intraoperative bleeding gave similar results , and therefore the unadjusted results have been used .
similar analyses were done after stratifying the patients according to type of surgery .
because 4 patients had been enrolled twice , as they had a subsequent fracture of the contralateral hip during the study period , a mixed - effects model analysis was performed to validate the results of the t - test and regression analyses .
complications were compared .
the 30 - day and 90 - day mortality rates were compared between the groups .
all analyses were two - sided and a p - value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance .
results patients most of the 288 patients ( with 292 fractures ) received the allocated intervention , but 3 patients assigned to non - compression ( 1 hemiarthroplasty and 2 intramedullary nail ) received compression ordered by the anesthesiologist because of " excessive bleeding " and 5 patients assigned to compression ( 1 hemiarthroplasty , 4 sliding plate ) removed the bandage because of discomfort or confusion after 1 , 7 , 8 , and 10 hours ( the time was not recorded for 1 patient ) .
there were no differences between the 2 groups regarding their baseline characteristics ( table 1 ) .

complications and mortality no differences in complications or mortality were found between the 2 groups .
superficial wound infection occurred in 6 patients ( 4.3 %) in the compression group and 8 ( 5.2 %) in the non - compression group ; all healed without treatment , or with antibiotics .
no deep wound infections occurred .
1 patient in the non - compression group had a minor wound rupture that healed without surgery .
another patient in the non - compression group developed a blister near the surgical wound , recorded as a complication to the bandage .
sacral pressure ulcers were registered in 4 patients in the compression group and in 5 in the non - compression group .
deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 2 patients in each group and pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 2 patients in the compression group .

7 patients died during the primary hospital stay , with the causes of death being cerebral embolism , myocardial infarction , heart failure , pulmonary edema , kidney failure , pneumonia , or septicemia .
for the patients who died after discharge , the cause of death was not ascertained .
discussion the compression bandage evaluated in our study has previously been reported to be effective in reducing the need for transfusion , but not the blood loss , following tha in patients with oa ( hornberg et al. 2002 , johansson et al. 2005a ) .
the former study compared 26 patients who received the compression bandage with 24 patients who received a standard wound dressing , and reported a significantly reduced amount of postoperative blood transfusion and a significantly reduced proportion of transfused patients in the compression group ( hornberg et al. 2002 ) .
the later study compared 51 patients who had the compression bandage and no wound drainage with 54 patients who had a standard dressing and wound drainage , and it reported a significantly reduced amount of blood transfusion in the compression group but not a reduced proportion of transfused patients ( johansson et al. 2005a ) .
we could not demonstrate that the compression bandage was similarly effective after hip fracture surgery .
one possible explanation is that oa patients and hip fracture patients differ in important factors such as age , body mass , general health status , and medications .
it is common to advise oa patients to stop intake of drugs known to increase bleeding ( such as asa and nsaids ) before surgery ( fauno et al. 1993 , hornberg et al. 2002 , johansson et al. 2005b ) .
in the present study , there were no differences between groups regarding the use of such drugs before surgery .
in fracture patients , preoperative bleeding from the fracture itself can be considerable - - a factor that is not influenced by the compression bandage .
the two studies that reported an advantage in using the compression bandage in tha used wound drain , either in both groups ( hornberg et al. 2002 ) or only in the control group ( johansson et al. 2005a ) .
wound drain was , however , not used in our study and it is currently not commonly used after hip arthroplasty ( niskanen et al. 2000 ) or hip fracture surgery ( tjeenk et al .
2005 ) since neither the blood loss nor the wound infection rates are affected .
the study by hornberg et al .
( 2002 ) was relatively small and did not adjust for other differences , possibly resulting in a type - 1 error .
the study by johansson et al .
( 2005a ) reported somewhat conflicting findings : a reduction in the mean number of transfused units but not in the number of patients transfused .
in the light of our results , a larger randomized study may be warranted to confirm the efficacy of the compression bandage in patients undergoing primary tha for oa. however , in hip fracture surgery , our results from a large sample size did not show any evidence to suggest that the compression bandage may be effective .
we used intention - to - treat analysis but only 3 patients randomized to the non - compression group received compression , so this cannot have influenced the results .
in our study , we used the pressure levels and application time proposed by the manufacturer and used by hornberg et al .
( 2002 ) , but somewhat shorter than the application time used by johansson et al .
( 2005a ) .
it is not known whether a higher pressure level and / or a longer application time might be more effective .
one limitation of our study is that many eligible patients were not enrolled because of difficulty in obtaining consent , or because they were not asked to participate by the surgeon at the emergency department .
many patients suffer from dementia and / or confusion on admission and are therefore incapable of giving informed consent , and it was not always possible to contact a family member .
however , it seems very unlikely that this factor would have influenced the results .
to determine the need for blood transfusion , we used hb below 100 g / l. this transfusion threshold has been used in some studies ( anekstein et al .
2004 , muir 1995 ) but other studies have used lower thresholds of 70 - 90 g / l ( marval and hardman 2004 ) .
one pilot study randomized 84 patients with hip fracture to receive transfusion if hb levels dropped below the predefined threshold of 100 g / l , or to receive transfusion only for symptoms of anemia or a hb of less than 80 g / l , but no firm conclusions could be drawn from that study ( carson et al. 1998b ) .
consequently , there is a lack of evidence on which to base the transfusion threshold following hip fracture surgery .
in the 2 studies with pneumatic wound compression in oa patients , hornberg et al .
( 2002 ) used a transfusion threshold of hb below 100 g / l and johansson et al .
( 2005a ) used hb below 90 g / l or " symptoms of anemia requiring transfusion " .
many authors have advocated lower thresholds ( carson et al 1998a , madjdpour et al. 2006 ) .
using a lower transfusion threshold in our study would have resulted in fewer transfused patients and a lower amount of transfusions in both groups , but it is unlikely that this would have influenced the results regarding the efficacy of the compression bandage .
pressure applied to the surgical wound could theoretically give rise to local skin ischemia and thereby increase the risk of delayed healing , wound rupture , necrosis , or infection .
in a study of 965 cervical hip fractures , wound infection occurred in 7 % of patients receiving blood transfusion and in 4 % of those not receiving blood transfusion ( levi and sandberg 1998 ) .
in our study , the rate of superficial wound infection was 5 % , which is in agreement with previous studies ( merrer et al .
2007 ) , with no difference found between the compression and control groups .
one other potential complication of using a compression bandage is the occurrence of pressure ulcers .
however , both groups had equal amounts of sacral pressures and no patient developed ulcers on either hip .
compression around the hip region might theoretically cause venous stasis and increased risk of thromboembolic events .
according to a cochrane review , deep vein thrombosis occurs in up to 26 % of patients following hip fracture surgery , despite prophylaxis with lmwh ( handoll et al. 2002 ) .
in our study , clinical thromboembolic complications occurred in 3.6 % of patients in the compression group , which is a relatively low rate .

the garlic - derived thioallyl compounds s - allylcysteine ( sac ) and s - allylmercaptocysteine ( samc ) have been shown to have multiple biological activities .
here we show that sac and samc increase lifespan and stress resistance in caenorhabditis elegans and reduce accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) .
these compounds do not appear to activate daf - 16 ( foxo orthologue ) or mimic dietary restriction ( dr ) effects , but selectively induce skn - 1 ( nrf1 / 2 / 3 orthologue ) targets involved in oxidative stress defense .
interestingly , their treatments do not facilitate skn - 1 nuclear accumulation , but slightly increased intracellular skn - 1 levels .
our data also indicate that thioallyl structure and the number of sulfur atoms are important for skn - 1 target induction .
our results indicate that sac and samc may serve as potential agents that slow aging .
the human body is constantly exposed to reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , which are generated by aerobic respiration in the mitochondria and as byproducts of diverse metabolic reactions in cells .
overproduction of ros causes damage to cellular proteins , lipids and dna , eventually contributing to various chronic diseases including cancer , diabetes , parkinson 's and alzheimer 's disease , cardiovascular disease and chronic inflammation1 .
therefore , cumulative oxidative damage to the cells may also influence aging .
it is known that antioxidant vitamins c and e existing in a wide variety of foods act cooperatively to protect cells from lipid peroxidation by directly neutralizing harmful hydroxyl radicals2 .
additionaly , sulforaphane , a natural dietary isothiocyanate produced in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and broccoli sprouts , has been shown to induce phase ii detoxification genes , e.g. heme oxygenase - 1 ( ho - 1 ) , nad ( p ) h : quinone oxidoreductase , gamma - glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione s - transferases ( gsts ) , through activating nrf2 ( nf - e2 - related factor ) signaling3 .
the induction of these enzymes by sulforaphane protects cells from damage associated to oxidative stress in diverse in vivo and in vitro experimental conditions3 .
therefore , intake of these natural compounds through diet could help to prevent pathogenesis of chronic diseases and contribute to slow aging , or in other words extend health span of organisms .
garlic ( allium sativum l. ) has been widely used as a food and folk medicine since ancient times .
a number of studies have indicated that garlic possesses diverse pharmacological potentials related to chronic diseases , such as anticancer4 , antithrombotic5 , hypolipidemic6 and hepatoprotective activity7 .
many of these beneficial effects have been shown to be attributed to garlic characteristic organosulfur compounds ( osc ) , including s - allylcysteine ( sac ) and s - allylmercaptocysteine ( samc ) 8910111213 .
sac and samc are the major water - soluble oscs naturally occurring during aging process of garlic , and known to act as free radical scavengers14 .
therefore , some of these protective effects of sac and samc could potentially be explained by their radical scavenging activity .
while some studies have demonstrated that sac and samc inhibited growth of human cancer cells in vitro1215 , and development of chemically induced cancers or growth of implanted tumors in vivo along with increasing levels of gsts816 .
gsts play a key role in the phase ii detoxification response , which provides a conserved defense against oxidative stress17 .
more recent study demonstrated that sac treatment protected primary cultured neurons and mice against oxidative insults and middle cerebral artery occlusion - induced ischemic damages , respectively , through increases in the levels of nrf2 protein and target genes expressions , such as gamma - glutamylcysteine synthetase catalytic subunit ( gclc ) , gamma - glutamylcysteine synthetase modulatory subunit ( gclm ) and ho - 118 .
because development of cancer , oxidative stress response and apoptosis are strongly associated with aging , we considered the question of whether sac and samc can retard aging .
however , the ability of sac and samc to modulate organismal aging and the potential mechanisms involved have not been reported .
since the finding in caenorhabditis elegans that reduction in signaling through the conserved insulin / igf - i signaling ( iis ) pathway results in more than double the mean lifespan compared with wild - type19 , aging has become a particularly active area of research .
further studies have identified genes and molecular mechanisms involved in stress responses and longevity .
for example , the lifespan extension caused by reduced iis requires the activity of daf - 16 , the foxo ( forkhead box o ) orthologue , which induces entry into larval diapause but also promotes longevity in adults19 .
when iis is reduced under conditions where dauer - associated processes are inactive in adults , lifespan extension also requires skn - 1 , the nrf1 / 2 / 3 orthologue20 , which increases resistance to various stresses21 .
in addition , reduced iis causes each of these proteins to accumulate in nuclei , leading to upregulation of target genes involved in longevity , stress responses , metabolism , and the extracellular matrix20222324 .
in c. elegans , skn - 1 is required for lifespan to be extended by a variety of different interventions20242526272829 .
under oxidative stress conditions , pmk - 1 , a p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) , phosphorylates skn - 1 , leading to its nuclear accumulation and target gene expression30 .
in addition to the longevity modulating effect of skn - 1 , recent studies have also demonstrated its critical roles in protein homeostasis under conditions of reduced translation or proteasome activity3132 or increased endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress33 .
skn - 1 then selectively induces distinct but partly overlapping set of its downstream target genes under these diverse conditions .
in this study , we have investigated how sac and samc affect lifespan and oxidative stress resistance of c. elegans .
in addition , we examined their effects on pathways regulated by the daf - 16 / foxo and skn - 1 / nrf transcription factors .
we also tested whether sac and samc could mimic a dietary restriction ( dr ) - like environment , which is strongly linked to longevity of various species including c. elegans .
finally , we investigated effect of various oscs from garlic and their analogs on induction of a gst - 4p : : gfp transgene , an indicator of skn - 1 activity .
results and discussion sac and samc extend c. elegans lifespan under normal conditions we first evaluated whether sac and samc ( fig. 1a ) influence the lifespan of wild - type c. elegans under normal conditions .
to eliminate the possibilities that these compounds could affect growth of e. coli op50 , and vice versa live bacteria could metabolize these compounds , we used uv - killed e. coli op50 in the lifespan and the following assays .
in our lifespan assays , sac - and samc - treatment were begun on the first day of adulthood with concentrations at 1 , 10 , and 100 mum at 20 degreesc .
as a result , sac produced significant increase in the mean lifespan of adult animals ( 7.5 % for 1 mum ( p < 0.001 ) , 17.0 % for 10 mum ( p < 0.001 ) and 15.6 % for 100 mum ( p < 0.001 ) , fig. 1b , supplementary table s1 ) .
similarly , samc - treatment also significantly increased the mean lifespan ( 5.8 % for 1 mum ( p < 0.05 ) , 19.7 % for 10 mum ( p < 0.001 ) and 20.9 % for 100 mum ( p < 0.001 ) , fig. 1c , supplementary table s1 ) .
on the other hand , sac and samc did not affect the maximum lifespan of wild - type c. elegans ( supplementary table s1 ) .
these results would suggest that these compounds influence the death of younger but not older animals .
one possible reason for the lack of effects of these compounds on the maximum lifespan is attributed to decreased stability and / or persistence of effects of these compounds because sac and samc were only added to c. elegans on the first day of the lifespan experiments .
therefore , it is possible that additional treatments with fresh sac and samc during middle or late period of the lifespan experiments might affect the maximum lifespan .
given that the significant extension of the mean lifespan of wild - type c. elegans was achieved at 10 and 100 mum of each compound , we performed the following experiments at these concentrations .
sac and samc enhance stress resistance and reduce ros levels under oxidative - and heat - stress conditions in c.elegans , increased lifespan is sometimes associated with improved survival under conditions of oxidative or heat stress3435 .
to investigate whether sac and samc could enhance resistance to stress , we pretreated wild - type adults with 10 mum of sac or samc for 2 days at 20 degreesc , followed by exposure to oxidative ( juglone , an intracellular ros generator ) or heat stress ( 35 degreesc ) .
both sac - and samc - pretreatment increased survival after juglone exposure ( fig. 1d ) and heat stress ( fig. 1e ) at significantly higher ratio than untreated control .
these results indicate that both compounds exert protective roles against oxidative and heat stress in c. elegans .
because both juglone treatment and heat shock cause cellular damage by accumulation of ros , we next investigated whether sac and samc could lower the intracellular ros level under stress conditions by using cm - h2dcfda , a fluorescent probe that reacts with ros .
the results showed that pretreatment with sac or samc significantly suppresses oxidative or heat stress - induced accumulation of ros compared to untreated control ( fig. 1f,g ) , suggesting that the increase in lifespan and stress resistance by sac - or samc - treatment is associated with reduced ros levels .
since sac and samc have been shown to act as radical scavengers14 , the increased lifespan and stress resistance by sac and samc could be at least in part due to the direct antioxidant properties .
on the other hand , there is increasing evidence that sac and samc modulate pathways involved in oxidative stress response81618 .
therefore , we investigated whether the sac - and samc - mediated increase in stress resistance and longevity in c. elegans could be produced by activating pathways particularly associated with oxidative stress responses and longevity .
sac and samc do not affect daf - 16 / foxo activity in c. elegans , the evolutionarily conserved daf - 16 / foxo transcription factor regulates many biological processes including stress resistance and longevity2223 .
therefore , we examined whether sac and samc could have any effect on daf - 16 signaling .
we first monitored expression of transgenes in which promoter for daf - 16 target genes sod - 3 ( superoxide dismutase ) or hsp - 16.2 ( small heat shock protein ) is fused to green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) , respectively .
as shown in fig. 2a , juglone ( positive control ) upregulated the expression of both sod - 3p : : gfp and hsp - 16.2p : : gfp transcriptional reporters , whereas no induction of these reporters was observed by sac - and samc - treatment ( 100 mum each for 24 hours ) .
we also examined expression of endogenous sod - 3 , hsp - 16.2 , and ctl - 2 ( catalase ) mrnas by quantitative rt - pcr ( qrt - pcr ) , and found that neither of these genes was activated by these compounds ( 100 mum each for 24 hours ) ( fig. 2b ) .
to further investigate the effect of sac and samc on daf - 16 signaling , we examined whether sac and samc could promote accumulation of a daf - 16a : : gfp translational fusion protein in the nucleus .
like other transcription factors , nuclear localization of daf - 16 is associated with its transcription - activating activity .
exposure to juglone and heat stress resulted in remarkable nuclear localization of daf - 16a : : gfp , whereas no nuclear localization of daf - 16a : : gfp was observed in animals treated with sac or samc ( 100 mum each for 24 hours ) ( fig. 2c ) .
to further elucidate the involvement of daf - 16 signaling in the effects of sac and samc on nematodes , we performed the lifespan assays using the daf - 16 ( mgdf47 ) mutant .
we found that treatments with sac and samc at 10 and 100 mum appeared to prolong survival of the daf - 16 ( mgdf47 ) mutant in early stage of adult life ( fig. 2d,e , supplementary table s2 ) , and when we combined three independent assays , significant extension of the mean lifespan was observed in treatments with 10 and 100 mum of these compounds , although this lifespan extension was reduced compared to wild - type ( supplementary table s2 ) .
in addition , sac and samc did not extend the maximum lifespan of this mutant presumably due to the same reason as observed in wild - type ( supplementary table s2 ) .
taken together , our results show that sac - and samc - mediated increase in lifespan and stress resistance appears to be in part independent of daf - 16 signaling .
sac and samc promote longevity by modulating skn - 1 in c. elegans , the transcription factor skn - 1 / nrf plays a critical role in promoting oxidative stress resistance and longevity by upregulating numerous genes , including phase ii detoxification enzymes2426303637 .
to investigate whether sac - and samc - treatment could modulate skn - 1 activity , we first examined the effect of sac and samc on expression of gst - 4 ( glutathione s - transferase ) gene , one of the key phase ii enzyme genes that is strongly activated in response to oxidative stress3637 .
we treated the transgenic animals , which contains a gst - 4p : : gfp transcriptional reporter transgene , with juglone ( positive control ) , sac and samc .
all these treatments resulted in a dramatic increase in gfp expression compared to untreated control ( fig. 3a ) .
to confirm whether the gst - 4p : : gfp induction by sac - and samc - treatment could require skn - 1 , we treated the skn - 1 ( zu67 ) mutant , which carries the gst - 4p : : gfp transgene , with sac and samc .
we found that no induction of gst - 4p : : gfp was observed by these compounds in this mutant ( fig. 3b ) , indicating that the induction of gst - 4p : : gfp by sac and samc is completely dependent upon skn - 1 .
it has been demonstrated that skn - 1 loss - of - function mutants have shortened lifespans , and in contrast , that increased expression or activity of skn - 1 increases c. elegans lifespan24 .
we next examined whether sac - and samc - mediated extension of lifespan requires skn - 1 .
we treated the skn - 1 ( zu135 ) mutant with sac and samc , and found that both compounds failed to increase the mean lifespan of this mutant compared to untreated control ( fig. 3c,d , supplementary table s3 ) .
instead , this mutation shortened the mean lifespan in the presence of 100 mum sac or samc ( fig. 3c,d , supplementary table s3 ) .
this may indicate that sac and samc have caused toxicity to the skn - 1 ( zu135 ) mutant .
even in wild - type c. elegans , sac and samc might partly act as mild stressors .
on the other hand , the toxic effects of these compounds might be offset by activation of skn - 1 , leading to induction of stress defense genes such as gst - 4 and eventually extension of mean lifespan .
together , these results suggest that skn - 1 is required for the sac - and samc - mediated lifespan extension .
in c. elegans , skn - 1 is activated in response to diverse interventions , such as oxidative - and er - stress , and reduced translation and proteasome activity , leading to partially overlapping but distinct set of target gene expression2627313233 .
to investigate how sac - and samc - treatment could affect expression of skn - 1 target genes , we examined mrna levels of some skn - 1 targets related to response against oxidative - or er - stress , and reduced translation elongation or proteasome activity .
sac - and samc - treatment on wild - type animals significantly induced some oxidative stress defense genes , gst - 4 and gcs - 1 ( gamma - glutamylcysteine synthase heavy chain2630 ) , except gst - 1027 ( fig. 3e,f ) .
additionally , the skn - 1 - dependent er and oxidative stress - related transcription factor atf - 5 ( a mammalian bzip transcription factors atf42733 ) was also induced by these compounds ( fig. 3e,f ) .
on the other hand , sac and samc did not increase transcription of hsp - 4 ( heat shock protein ) and haf - 7 ( an ortholog of human atp - binding cassette b9 , abcb9 ) ( fig. 3e,f ) , which are induced by skn - 1 in response to er stress and reduced translation , respectively27313233 .
knockdown of some proteasome subunit genes by rnai induces skn - 1 - dependent expression of endogenous gst - 4 and gst - 1032 .
additionally , the amyloid - binding dye thioflavin t ( tht ) has been shown to extend c. elegans lifespan dependent upon skn - 1 and also hsf - 1 ( heat shock factor 1 ) , which promotes protein homeostasis38 .
tht also suppresses aggregation of amyloid - beta ( 3 - 42 ) peptide and polyglutamine , which are associated with alzheimer 's disease and several neurological conditions , respectively , in c. elegans models38 .
one possibility is that undesirable accumulation of aggregated or misfolded proteins in cells might activate skn - 1 to induce its targets associated with protein homeostasis .
in contrast , our data indicated that sac and samc did not substantially affect mrna levels of various components of the proteasomal complex ; rpt - 3 ( an atpase subunit of the 19s proteasome ) , rpn - 12 ( a non - atpase subunit of the 19s proteasome ) , pas - 4 ( an alpha - rings subunit of the 20s proteasome ) , and pbs - 6 ( a beta - rings subunit of the 20s proteasome ) 32 ( fig. 3e,f ) .
we further examined the effect of sac and samc on the 26s proteasome activity and found that these compounds had no effect on its activity ( supplementary fig. s1 ) , suggesting that these compounds appear to activate skn - 1 through a mechanism uncoupled from protein homeostasis .
taken together , these results suggest that sac and samc may act primarily on oxidative stress response genes regulated by skn - 1 , and that this may confer the increased lifespan and stress resistance associated with sac and samc treatment .
we also tested the possibility of whether sac and samc could induce expression of skn - 1 itself , thus leading to induction of its target genes .
results showed that these compounds had no effect on skn - 1 mrna expression ( fig. 3e,f ) .
therefore , we next examined whether sac and samc could modulate skn - 1 activity at the protein level .
under oxidative stress conditions , skn - 1 is activated by p38 mapk pathway signaling30 .
p38 mapk directly phosphorylates specific sites within skn - 1 , which then accumulates in the nucleus and activates oxidative stress defense genes such as gcs - 12630 .
downstream of or in parallel to this regulation , wdr - 23 ( wd40 repeat protein ) physically interacts with skn - 1 and cul - 4 / ddb - 1 ubiquitin ligase complex in the nucleus , which presumably ubiquitinylates skn - 1 protein and targets it for proteasomal degradation37 .
to elucidate how sac and samc modulate skn - 1 activity , we first examined the effect of these compounds on the p38 mapk pathway .
we treated the sek - 1 ( km4 ) mutant , a gene encoding p38 mapkk that function is essential for the p38 mapk pathway , with sac and samc and examined the effect of these compounds on gst - 4 mrna expression .
as a result , these compounds also activated transcription of gst - 4 in this mutant as well as that of wild - type ( fig. 3g ) , suggesting that the sac - and samc - mediated activation of gst - 4 transcription , which requires skn - 1 ( fig. 3b ) , might be independent of the p38 mapk pathway .
this was surprising because induction of gcs - 1 is drastically inhibited in the sek - 1 ( p38 mapkk ) and pmk - 1 ( p38 mapk ) mutants30 .
on the other hand , it is also indicated that transcription of gcs - 1 is activated in the sek - 1 ( km4 ) mutant when several genes ( e.g. c48b6.2 , phi - 43 or wdr - 23 ) are knocked down by rnai31 .
in addition , another study also demonstrated that wdr - 23 rnai robustly induced gst - 4 transcription in the sek - 1 ( km4 ) mutant37 .
therefore , we next assessed the possibility that sac and samc could activate skn - 1 and its target expressions through regulation by wdr - 23 .
to test this idea , we examined the effect of wdr - 23 knockdown by rnai on the sac - and samc - induced gst - 4 mrna expression .
as shown in fig. 3h , wdr - 23 rnai drastically caused gst - 4 mrna expression in untreated control animals compared with that of control rnai , and no additional increase in gst - 4 expression was observed in the sac - or samc - treated animals .
this suggests that sac and samc might modulate skn - 1 activity by regulating wdr - 23 or its interaction with skn - 1 , or possibly by stabilizing skn - 1 .
loss of wdr - 23 function causes nuclear accumulation of skn - 1 in intestine , and increases skn - 1 protein levels , leading to activation of target genes37 .
therefore , we next assessed the possibility whether sac - and samc - treatment could promote nuclear accumulation of skn - 1 .
we examined the effect of these compounds on subcellular distribution of a skn - 1b / c : : gfp translational fusion protein that encodes two of three skn - 1 isoforms .
we treated l4 animals with sac or samc , and then measured nuclear accumulation of skn - 1b / c : : gfp at l3 or l4 stages of the next generation .
results showed that sac - and samc - treatment did not detectably increase nuclear accumulation of skn - 1b / c : : gfp under normal conditions ( fig. 3i ) , suggesting that these compounds do not substantially affect nuclear localization of skn - 1 .
on the other hand , it is also possible that hypochlorite treatment for the preparation of l1 animals of the next generation may affect the inducibility of nuclear skn - 1 or levels of skn - 1 protein in later larval stages , leading to a failure of detection of skn - 1b / c : : gfp nuclear localization .
to address this possibility , we treated l4 animals of the next generation with acute oxidative stress , 2 % nan3 ( as a positive control of skn - 1b / c : : gfp nuclear localization ) for 15 min after pretreatments with sac or samc .
results showed that this acute oxidative stress caused drastic nuclear accumulation of skn - 1b / c : : gfp as indicated in ref .
36 , and population of animals with nuclear skn - 1b / c : : gfp slightly but reproducibly increased after exposure to 2 % nan3 when they were pretreated with sac or samc ( fig. 3i ) .
taken together , these results implicate that sac and samc do not cause nuclear accumulation of skn - 1 directly under normal conditions , but may facilitate nuclear accumulation of skn - 1 in response to acute oxidative stress by possibly defending it against degradation through wdr - 23 regulation .
consistent with our observation , some studies demonstrated that reduced mtorc1 ( mammalian target of rapamacin complex ) and tunicamicin - induced er stress also upregulated skn - 1 targets without robust accumulation of this transcription factor in the nucleus2833 .
in addition , tunicamicin treatment also causes increase of intracellular abundance of skn - 1 protein33 .
therefore , we investigated whether sac - and samc - treatment could increase intracellular skn - 1 protein levels .
to test this idea , total amount of skn - 1 protein in sac - or samc - treated animals was assessed by western blotting using a polyclonal skn - 1 antibody , which was raised against skn - 1c isoform and should detect all of main skn - 1 isoforms ( skn - 1a , 1b and 1c ) .
this antibody recognized multiple bands , and four of these increased by wdr - 23 rnai and decreased in the skn - 1 ( zu135 ) mutant , suggesting that these four bands might correspond to each skn - 1 isoform ( 1a ~ 1d ) ( fig. 3j left ) .
as shown in fig. 3j ( middle and right ) , sac and samc slightly but reproducibly increased protein levels of species that may correspond to the skn - 1b ( 2.0 ~ 2.4 - fold ) and skn - 1d ( 1.9 ~ 2.3 - fold ) isoforms , respectively .
skn - 1b is principally expressed in the asi neurons , which sense food availability and influence metabolism , and are involved in dietary restriction - induced longevity2639 .
even though the transcript of skn - 1d has been reported in wormbase , neither expression nor function of the smallest isoform has been described .
at the moment , the underlying mechanisms of the selective increase in these two skn - 1 isoforms by sac and samc are still unclear .
in mammals , kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap1 ) directly binds to nrf2 , and targets it for polyubiquitination and then proteasomal degradation21 .
some electrophilic compounds including sulforaphane have been demonstrated to bind to some cysteines in keap1 , and thus leading to release of active nrf240. c. elegans lacks a keap1 ortholog41 , and instead wdr - 23 directly interacts with skn - 1 and targets it for proteasomal degradation37 .
currently , we have been investigating the possibility whether these compounds could bind to redox - reactive cysteines in wdr - 23 or skn - 1 itself .
sac and samc do not affect body size and reproduction , but enhance food intake of wild - type c. elegans it has been revealed that reducing food intake ( dietary restriction , dr ) extends lifespan of a wide range of species , including c. elegans3942434445 .
in c. elegans , dr - induced extension of lifespan appears to require skn - 1b particularly in the asi neurons2639 .
our findings also suggest that sac and samc increased levels of the skn - 1b isoform ( fig. 3j ) .
therefore , we considered the possibility that sac and samc might activate skn - 1 in the asi neurons to produce dr - like state , leading to lifespan extension .
since diet - restricted animals also exhibit reduced brood size , extended reproductive period , and smaller body size39 , we examined the influence of sac - and samc - treatments on reproductive capacity .
the results showed that the animals treated with sac or samc for 8 days exhibited a significant increase in progeny production on the 1st and 2nd day of reproductive period , although the total number of progeny was not statistically significant compared to untreated animals ( fig. 4a ) .
furthermore , neither sac nor samc affected the reproductive period of c. elegans ( fig. 4a ) , suggesting that sac and samc do not affect the reproductive capacity of c.elegans .
we next examined whether sac and samc could affect c. elegans body size .
the result showed that wild - type animals raised in the presence of either sac or samc for 8 days did not exhibited any differences in body length compared to untreated animals ( fig. 4b ) , suggesting that sac and samc also seem to be unrelated with dr with respect to body length .
to assess whether sac - or samc - treatment could cause reduced food intake , we examined the level of food ( uv - killed e. coli op50 ) consumption by measuring the optical density ( od ) of wells containing equal numbers of animals ( n = 50 ) after 8 days of treatments with sac or samc .
the mean values of od 620 nm of wells without c. elegans were comparable among treatments , suggesting that these compounds do not affect food concentration directly ( fig. 4c ) .
on the other hand , sac - and samc - treated animals showed a significant increase in food consumption compared to untreated control ( fig. 4c ) .
this phenomenon became visually apparent after about 5 days of treatment ( unpublished data ) .
one likely explanation for this phenomenon is that sac - and samc - mediated activation of skn - 1 could slow aging of c. elegans , and this health promoting effects of these compounds may lead to the elevated food consumption of this organism , despite enhanced food consumption itself produces more ros in cells in general .
taken all together , these results indicate that , at least for parameters investigated here , sac and samc do not extend c. elegans lifespan by producing a dr - like state .
the thioallyl structure and disulfide bond in garlic - derived oscs are important for skn - 1 activation including sac and samc , numerous oscs , such as s - alk ( en ) ylcysteines , s - alk ( en ) ylcysteine sulfoxides , gamma - glutamyl - s - alk ( en ) ylcysteines , and allylsulfides , have been identified from garlic46 .
some of those have been shown to have diverse pharmacological properties as sac and samc , such as radical scavenging activity , chemopreventive activity , hepatoprotective activity , neurotropic activity , and lipid reducing activity810114748 .
moreover , a recent study reported that diallyl trisulfide ( dats ) , one of the allylsulfides derived from garlic , is also able to induce gst - 4 gene expression under control of skn - 1 with extended longevity in c. elegans49 .
therefore , we considered the question of whether other oscs in garlic might activate skn - 1 / nrf as well as sac and samc , and whether their structures might be correlated with this activity .
to address this possibility , we tested the effect of garlic - derived oscs and their analogs on induction of gst - 4p : : gfp transgene .
as shown in table 1 , of 23 compounds tested , 5 compounds ( sac ; 4.9 - fold ( p < 0.001 ) , samc ; 8.1 - fold ( p < 0.001 ) , dads ( diallyldisulfide ) ; 3.4 - fold ( p < 0.001 ) , dats ; 9.1 - fold ( p < 0.001 ) , gsamc ( gamma - glutamyl - s - allylmercaptocysteine ) ; 3.0 - fold ( p < 0.001 )) produced a significant increase in gst - 4p : : gfp expression compared to untreated control .
importantly , all these compounds commonly have the thioallyl structure .
moreover , there was a positive correlation between the number of disulfide bonds and gst - 4p : : gfp induction levels as in the case of sac < samc , and das < dads < dats .
among compounds containing the allyl structure , alliin ( s - allylcysteine sulfoxide ) , in which the sulfur atom of sac forms sulfoxide group , and oas ( o - allylserine ) , in which the sulfur atom of sac is substituted by oxygen , exhibited no gst - 4p : : gfp induction .
in addition , gsac ( gamma - glutamyl - s - allylcysteine ) and gsamc , in which glutamic acid is attached to alpha - amino group of cysteine , exhibited weaker gst - 4p : : gfp inducible activity than sac and samc , respectively .
similarly , sahc ( s - allylhomocysteine ) and samhc ( s - allylmercaptohomocysteine ) had no significant effect on the activity .
taken together , we found out the following structurally important factors that affect gst - 4p : : gfp inducible activity ; i ) the thioallyl structure is essential ; ii ) an increasing number of sulfur atoms in sulfide bonds leads to enhanced activity ; iii ) the sulfur atom adjacent to the allyl group and iv ) cysteine structure are also important factors influencing the activity .
given that sac and samc possibly stabilize skn - 1 by suppressing the interaction between skn - 1 and wdr - 23 through binding to reactive cysteines in either of these proteins , it would be interesting to see whether these activity - related factors are closely linked to this event .
the finding that the increasing number of disulfide bonds correlates with the gst - 4p : : gfp inducible activity raises the question of whether the number of disulfide bonds in these compounds might also coorelate with their protective effect .
to address this , we performed oxidative stress assays using sac , samc , dads and dats ( 10 mum each ) , and found significantly higher survivals after treatment with dads ( 41.9 +/ - 3.1 % ; p < 0.001 ) and dats ( 41.4 +/ - 2.6 % ; p < 0.001 ) compared to dmso control ( 16.0 +/ - 3.4 %) ( table 1 , supplementary fig. s2 ) .
however , neither dads nor dats treatment increased survival as robustly as sac ( 83.2 +/ - 6.2 % ; p < 0.001 vs. dads and dats ) or samc ( 90.2 +/ - 4.0 % ; p < 0.001 vs. dads and dats ) ( table 1 , supplementary fig. s2 ) , indicating that there is no positive correlation between the number of disulfide bonds and stress resistance capacity .
similar results were obtained in the heat stress assays ( table 1 , supplementary fig. s3 ) .
because dats treatment at higher concentration ( 100 mum ) caused death of adult animals within 24 hours , this toxicity by dats might lead to the lower survivals in the oxidative stress assay in spite of its highest gst - 4p : : gfp inducible activity .
alternatively , it is also possible that there is an optimal level of skn - 1 activation which , if exceeded may be deleterious .
on the other hand , treatment with sac and samc at 100 mum still caused the increased mean lifespan ( fig. 1b,c ) and higher survivals ( 88.2 +/ - 10.4 % for sac , 91.1 +/ - 9.3 % for samc ( n = 3 experiments using more than 50 animals each )) in the oxidative stress assays .
these results implicate that sac and samc can be treated at higher concentrations with less toxicity , thus leading to a superior protective effect compared to dats .
interestingly , consistent with our findings , some previous studies using garlic - derived oscs also reported the importance of the thioallyl structure and / or the number of sulfur atoms in sulfide bonds on diverse biological activities .
for example , the study investigating chemopreventive activity of s - alk ( en ) ylcysteines and these disulfide derivatives indicated that thioallyl compounds , including sac , were the most effective for colon cancer prevention50 .
another study investigating neurotropic activity of s - alk ( en ) ylcysteines , s - alk ( en ) ylcysteine sulfoxides , gamma - glutamyl - s - alk ( en ) ylcysteine , and their analogs also indicated that only thioallyl compounds , such as sac , samc , das , dads , alliin , and gsac , were effective on the survival of cultured rat hippocampal neurons10 .
the study of radical scavenging capacity of some oscs also revealed that thioallyl structure and the number of the sulfur atoms contribute to the activity47 .
although direct target ( s ) of these thioallyl compounds and their underlying mechanisms are still unclear , the notable consistency of observations derived from these and our studies suggests that the thioallyl compounds from garlic play important roles in diverse biological processes including the skn - 1 / nrf pathway .
in conclusion , we have reported that sac and samc increase resistance to oxidative stress and longevity of the nematode c. elegans .
these beneficial effects of sac and samc are most likely conferred by modulation of skn - 1 / nrf activity and selective activation of its downstream targets involved in oxidative stress defense .
taken together our findings suggest that at least a portion of the multiple health promoting activities of garlic and its constituents , especially those from thioallyl compounds , could be explained by skn - 1 / nrf activation .
furthermore , our study may provide the possibility of applications of natural thioallyl compounds to the development of nutraceutical products and drugs targeting nrf pathway .
methods reagents sac and samc were synthesized as in refs .
51 and 7 , respectively , stored in water solution and added to culture medium at various concentrations .
strains and culture of c. elegans nematode strains used in this study are listed in supplementary table s4 .
each strain was maintained at 20 degreesc on nematode growth medium ( ngm ) agar plates carrying a lawn of e. coli op50 ( caenorhabditis genetics center ) according to ref .
52. unless otherwise stated , animals for each assay were raised according to the following procedure .
briefly , to synchronize growth of c. elegans , gravid hermaphrodites were treated with sodium hypochlorite and resulting eggs were kept overnight at 20 degreesc for hatching in s - complete liquid medium .
synchronized l1 animals were then transferred to a 96 - well plate in s - complete liquid medium containing amphotericin b ( 0.1 mug / ml ) and the uv - killed e. coli op50 ( 1.2 x 109 bacteria / ml ) , sealed to prevent evaporation , and kept at 20 degreesc53 .
uv killing of e. coli op50 was done using a stratalinker ( 9999 j / m2 , stratagene , la jolla , ca ) to exclude any effects of the test compounds on bacterial growth , and unexpected metabolism of these compounds by live bacteria54 .
5 - fluoro - 2 ' - deoxyuridine ( fudr , 0.12 mm ) was added 42 - 45 hours after seeding to prevent self - fertilization .
thirty micro liters of sac or samc solution , or h2o as solvent control were added on the first day of adulthood at final concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mum , respectively .
lifespan assays all lifespan assays were started on the first day of adulthood and performed at 20 degreesc .
to avoid starvation , an adequate amount of the uv - killed op50 was added to each well during assays .
counting of surviving or dead animals was performed daily using a microscope on the basis of movement until all animals had died .
before counting each plate was shaken for one minute on a plate shaker to facilitate observation of movement .
stress resistance assays synchronized day - 1 wild - type adults were pretreated with h2o , sac or samc ( 10 mum each ) for 48 hours at 20 degreesc .
for the oxidative stress assays , the animals were washed with phosphate - buffered saline with 1 % tween 20 ( pbst ) three times before treating with a ros generator , juglone ( 250 mum , sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) , for 2 hours at 20 degreesc .
for the thermo - tolerance assays , the animals were incubated at 35 degreesc for 7 hours , and then washed with pbst three times .
after a 16 hours recovery period on ngm agar , the survival was determined by touch - provoked movement .
animals were scored as dead when they failed to respond to touching with a platinum wire pick .
measurement of intracellular ros in c. elegans to measure intracellular ros accumulation level in animals after both the oxidative - and the heat - stress treatment , the surviving animals were incubated in the presence of 5 - ( and - 6 ) - chloromethyl - 2 ' , 7 ' - dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester ( cm - h2dcfda , 50 mum , invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) in pbst for 1 hour at 20 degreesc .
cm - h2dcfda is a cell permeable substance which is intracellularly converted to h2dcfs .
this nonfluorescent probe can be oxidized by interaction with intracellular ros to yield the fluorescent dye dcf .
after washing with pbst , the animals were mounted onto microscope slides coated with 2 % agarose , anesthetized with tetramisole ( 5 mm ) , and capped with cover slides .
fluorescence images were collected with a biorevo bz - 9000 fluorescent microscope ( keyence , osaka , japan ) using the gfp - bp filter set with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 535 nm. the fluorescence intensity of whole body was quantified as mean pixel density by using imagej software ( nih , bethesda , md ) .

juglone ( 10 or 100 mum ) was used as positive control .
gfp fluorescence images were collected with randomly selected animals as described in the measurement of intracellular ros .
for the sod - 3p : : gfp and hsp - 16.2p : : gfp reporters , gfp fluorescence from pharynx was quantified by imagej .
for the gst - 4p : : gfp reporter , gfp fluorescence from whole body was quantified .

total rna was extracted from about 50 animals with trizol ( invitrogen ) .
complementary dna was produced using random 6 - mer and oligo ( dt ) primer .
qpt - pcr was performed using sybr green as the detection method .
expression levels of each mrna relative to act - 1 gene were calculated with the comparative 2 - deltadeltact method .
primer sequences used in this study are listed in supplementary table s5 .
feeding rnai rnai was performed in a 96 - well plate format by feeding e. coli ht115 expressing rnai for either wdr - 23 ( clone id : cuukp3300d063q , source bioscience , nottingham , uk ) or control ( pl4440 ) to nematodes .
synchronized l1 animals were raised in s - complete liquid medium containing amphotericin b ( 0.1 mug / ml ) , ampicillin ( 100 mug / ml ) , isopropyl beta - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( iptg , 1 mm ) and 1.2 x 109 bacteria / ml of an overnight culture of rnai bacteria induced by iptg for 1 hour .
the animals were grown at 20 degreesc throughout the assay .
fudr ( 0.12 mm ) was added 42 - 45 hours after seeding .
on the first day of adulthood , the animals were treated with h2o , sac or samc ( 10 mum each ) for 24 hours at 20 degreesc , and expression levels of gst - 4 mrna were determined by qrt - pcr .

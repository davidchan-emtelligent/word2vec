abstract the brain 's default network ( dn ) has been a topic of considerable empirical interest .
in fmri research , dn activity is associated with spontaneous and self - generated cognition , such as mind - wandering , episodic memory retrieval , future thinking , mental simulation , theory of mind reasoning , and creative cognition .
despite large literatures on developmental and disease - related influences on the dn , surprisingly little is known about the factors that impact normal variation in dn functioning .
using structural equation modeling and graph theoretical analysis of resting - state fmri data , we provide evidence that openness to experience - - a normally distributed personality trait reflecting a tendency to engage in imaginative , creative , and abstract cognitive processes - - underlies efficiency of information processing within the dn. across two studies , openness predicted the global efficiency of a functional network comprised of dn nodes and corresponding edges .
in study 2 , openness remained a robust predictor - - even after controlling for intelligence , age , gender , and other personality variables - - explaining 18 % of the variance in dn functioning .
these findings point to a biological basis of openness to experience , and suggest that normally distributed personality traits affect the intrinsic architecture of large - scale brain systems .

introduction neuroimaging research has increasingly focused on examining large - scale structural and functional brain networks [ sporns , 2014 ] .
one of the most widely studied networks is the default network ( dn ) , a set of midline and inferior parietal brain regions that show increased metabolic activity in the absence of external task demands [ buckner et al. , 2008 ; greicius et al. , 2003 ] .
since the initial discovery of the dn , researchers have sought to clarify its role in attention and cognition .
dn activity is presumed to reflect spontaneous and self - generated cognitive processes , such as autobiographical memory retrieval , episodic future thinking , theory of mind reasoning , mental scene construction , moral decision making , creative cognition , daydreaming , and mind - wandering [ andrews - hanna et al. , 2014 ; beaty et al , in press ; fox et al. , 2015 ; stawarczyk and d'argembeau , 2015 ] .
developmental neuroscience has revealed consistent patterns of structural and functional connections within the dn that correspond to the emergence and decline of core cognitive and attentional processes [ fair et al. , 2008 ] .
moreover , aberrant dn connectivity has been linked to several psychiatric disorders , including major depression , schizophrenia , and autism [ menon , 2011 ] .
despite large literatures on developmental and disease - related influences on the dn , relatively little is known about normal variation in dn functioning .
emerging evidence , however , suggests that stable personality traits predict individual differences in structural and functional properties of discrete dn regions .
for example , deyoung et al. reported associations between dn regions and the big five personality traits ( i.e. , neuroticism , extraversion , openness to experience , agreeableness , and conscientiousness ) [ adelstein et al. , 2011 ; deyoung et al. , 2010 ] .
moreover , individual differences in the frequency and phenomenology of self - reported mind - wandering episodes has been linked to resting - state connectivity within core dn regions [ andrews - hanna et al. , 2014 ; o'callaghan et al. , 2015 ] .
such work suggests that normally distributed personality traits may account for individual differences in dn functioning .
however , because discrete dn regions are related to a wide range of cognitive , behavioral , and emotional variables , it remains unclear whether such traits affect global dn functioning , or whether they are uniquely related to individual dn regions .
here , we explore whether individual differences in personality could account for variation in global dn functioning .
we were particularly interested in the personality trait openness to experience , which is one of the so - called big five personality traits that capture the major dimension of covariation among all more specific personality traits .
openness is a normally distributed personality trait reflecting the tendency to engage in imaginative , creative , and abstract cognitive processes [ mccrae and costa , 1997 ] .
although openness is associated with several psychological outcomes , it is perhaps most commonly linked to flexibility of behavior and cognition [ deyoung , 2015 ] , making it a defining feature of creative individuals ( e.g. , artists and scientists ) [ jauk et al. , 2014 ; kaufman , 2013 ] .
people high in openness consistently show superior performance on assessments of creative cognitive ability [ beaty and silvia , 2013 ; deyoung , 2015 ; jauk et al. , 2013 ] .
understanding how openness relates to brain network functioning may provide greater insight into the neuroscience of creativity .
recently , deyoung [ 2014 , 2015 ] suggested that openness may be related to dn functioning because both openness and the dn are associated with imaginative cognition .
this contention has received support from personality neuroscience showing a positive correlation between openness and individual regions of the dn [ adelstein et al. , 2011 ] .
recent personality models suggest that this broad personality trait is comprised of two correlated but separable subdimensions - - openness and intellect [ deyoung et al. , 2007 ] - - which predict distinct behavioral and neural outcomes [ deyoung et al. , 2005 , 2009 ; kaufman et al. , in press ] .
this work thus sought to determine whether openness and intellect are differentially related to global functioning of the dn1 .
to this end , we applied graph theory - based methods to resting - state fmri data to assess individual differences in dn functioning .
several graph metrics have been developed to computationally assess topological properties of complex systems , including structural and functional brain networks [ medaglia et al. , 2015 ] .
one such measure is global efficiency [ latora and marchiori , 2001 ] .
in neurocognitive networks , this measure is thought to reflect efficiency of information processing [ achard and bullmore , 2007 ] .
variation in global brain network efficiency has previously been linked to a range of individual difference variables , including intelligence , spatial orientation , memory retrieval , mathematical abilities , and creativity [ alavash et al. , 2015 ; arnold et al. , 2013 ; klados et al. , 2013 ; langer et al. , 2012 ; ryman et al. , 2014 ; van den heuvel et al. , 2009 ] .
we obtained personality and resting - state fmri data from healthy adult participants recruited from the united states and europe .
two studies explored the role of openness in dn global efficiency .
study 1 sought to establish the effect of openness in dn efficiency .
in study 2 , we attempted to replicate and extend this effect by accounting for individual differences in intelligence , a variable with known links to brain structure and function [ van den heuvel et al. , 2009 ] .
we hypothesized that trait levels of openness would predict increased dn global efficiency , in light of past research linking individual dn regions to cognitive processes central to this personality trait .
study 1 participants the sample consisted of 68 young adults from the university of north carolina at greensboro ( uncg ; 41 females ; mean age : 20.60 , age range : 18 - 43 ) .
participants received cash payment or optional course credit for their involvement in the study .
all participants were right - handed with normal or corrected - to - normal vision , and they reported no history of neurological disorder .
the study was approved by uncg 's institutional review board .
behavioral assessment participants completed the openness / intellect subscale of the big five aspects scale ( bfas ) , a well - validated assessment of personality [ deyoung et al. , 2007 ] .
the scale measures two aspects of the big five ( 10 items each ) : openness to experience ( a trait characterized by cognitive engagement with perception , fantasy , aesthetics , and emotions ) and intellect ( a trait characterized by cognitive engagement with abstract reasoning and complex problem solving ) [ deyoung et al. , 2005 ] .
openness is assessed with items such as " i seldom daydream " ( reverse scored ) ; intellect is assessed with items such as " i like to solve complex problems. " although these two aspects are significantly associated with each other , previous neuroimaging and behavioral research indicates that they predict distinct outcomes [ deyoung et al. , 2009 ; kaufman et al. , in press ] .
mri data acquisition and preprocessing resting - state functional imaging data were acquired for five minutes as participants relaxed in the scanner with eyes closed .
whole - brain imaging was performed on a 3t siemens magnetom mri system ( siemens medical systems , erlangen , germany ) using a 16 - channel head coil .
bold - sensitive t2 * - weighted functional images were acquired using a single shot gradient - echo epi pulse sequence ( tr = 2000 ms , te = 30 ms , flip angle = 78degrees , 32 axial slices , 3.5 x 3.5 x 4.0 mm , distance factor 0 % , fov = 192 x 192 mm , interleaved slice ordering ) and corrected online for head motion .
the first two volumes were discarded to allow for t1 equilibration effects .
functional connectivity analysis was conducted using the conn toolbox in matlab [ whitfield - gabrieli and nieto - castanon , 2012 ] .
imaging data were slice - time corrected using the statistical parametric mapping ( spm ) 8 package ( wellcome trust centre for neuroimaging , london ) .
functional volumes were realigned , coregistered , and resliced to a voxel size of 2 mm ( 3 ) , normalized to the mni template brain ( montreal neurological institute ) , and smoothed with an 8 mm3 isotropic gaussian kernel .
additional preprocessing steps included low frequency filtering ( 0.008 - 0.09 hz ) and identification of artefactual variables via principal components analysis , including segmented white matter ( wm ) and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) [ behzadi et al. , 2007 ] .
wm , csf , and realignment parameters were regressed from the bold signal in a first - level analysis .
network construction the dn was defined as a graph consisting of 34 regions of interest ( roi ) derived from anatomical coordinates in a meta - analysis of resting - state networks [ see dosenbach et al. , 2010 , supporting information material ) .
these rois thus represented dn " nodes " and correlations between nodes represented network " edges " ( i.e. , functional connections ; see fig. 1a ) .
we formed 5mm spherical rois based on the mni coordinates from dosenbach et al .
[ 2010 ] , and extracted mean time series from each roi for graph analysis .
temporal correlations were computed between all pairs of rois , resulting in a 34 x 34 correlation matrix for each participant .
we computed adjacency matrices from the correlation matrices , and applied a conventional network threshold ( i.e. , wiring cost , k = 0.15 ) to account for spurious connections , resulting in a binary undirected graph .
dn integrity was assessed with global efficiency , which is mathematically expressed as the inverse of the average shortest path length in the network ( i.e. , the shortest number of paths needed to traverse between any pair of nodes in the network ) [ latora and marchiori , 2001 ] .
global efficiency has been shown to be a robust and reliable marker of network integrity [ duda et al. , 2014 ; medaglia et al. , 2015 ] .

note : all variables were standardized by z - transformation .
[ color figure can be viewed in the online issue , which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com. ] structural equation modeling ( sem ) we examined the relationship between openness / intellect and dn efficiency using sem .
sem employs latent variables to model error variance separately from true measurement variance [ skrondahl and rabe - hesketh , 2004 ] .
the 10 items from each facet were averaged to form two composite variables ( i.e. , openness and intellect ) .
we formed a latent variable by specifying the two facets as indicators , which were then used to predict global efficiency of the dn. for model identification , the paths of the latent variable indicators were constrained to be equal , and the variance of each latent variable was fixed to 1 [ kline , 2011 ] .
all analyses were conducted with mplus 7.2 using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors .
regression coefficients reported below are standardized .
because openness and intellect predict different outcomes [ deyoung et al. , 2009 ; kaufman et al. , in press ] , we also assessed the effects of each composite variable in separate univariate analyses .
results our first model assessed the association of the latent openness / intellect variable with global efficiency of the dn. sems revealed a significant effect of latent openness / intellect on global efficiency ( beta = 0.25 , p = 0.03 ) : as openness / intellect increased , the dn showed more efficient information processing ( see fig. 1b ) .
we then added age and gender to the model with openness / intellect predicting dn efficiency .
the effect of openness / intellect remained stable ( beta = 0.25 , p = 0.03 ) ; the effects of age and gender were near zero and nonsignificant ( p 's > 0.7 ) .
we then assessed the individual facets effects' on dn efficiency .
openness and intellect were highly correlated ( r = 0.61 ) , so separate regressions were conducted to avoid collinearity in the model2 .
univariate analyses revealed a significant effect of intellect ( beta = 0.23 , p = 0.04 ) and a nonsignificant effect of openness ( beta = 0.16 , p = 0.11 ) .
consistent with the above analysis , age , and gender showed small and non - significant effects in both models , and they did not affect the magnitude of the openness or intellect effects on dn efficiency .
study 2 study 2 sought to replicate and extend the effect of openness on dn functioning , using a different personality assessment in an independent and culturally distinct sample of participants .
we also sought to determine whether other major personality variables were related to dn efficiency ( i.e. , neuroticism , extraversion , agreeableness , and conscientiousness ) , or whether the effect was specific to openness .
in addition , we sought evidence for incremental validity of openness on the dn by assessing individual differences in intelligence - - a potential " third variable " that could account for variance in dn efficiency - - because intelligence has established links to brain structure and function [ van den heuvel et al. , 2009 ] .
participants the sample consisted of 86 healthy adults from the university of graz , austria and the surrounding community ( 49 females ; mean age : 30.35 , age range : 18 - 49 ) .
participants received cash payment for their involvement in the study .
all participants were right - handed with normal or corrected - to - normal vision , and reported no history of neurological disorder .
the study was approved by the university of graz ethics committee .
behavioral assessment participants completed a german version of the big - five structure inventory ( bfsi ) [ arendasy et al. , 2011 ] .
the bfsi assesses six facets of each of the big five traits ( neuroticism , extraversion , openness to experience , agreeableness , and conscientiousness ; 10 items per facet ) .
participants used a 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) scale to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements .
the bfsi has demonstrated good reliability and validity , and it correlates highly with the german version of the neo - five factor inventory [ arendasy et al. , 2011 ] .
participants also completed three intelligence tests from the intelligence structure battery : figural - inductive reasoning , verbal short - term memory , and arithmetic flexibility [ see jauk et al. , 2013 ] .
mri data acquisition and preprocessing resting - state functional imaging data were acquired for five minutes as participants relaxed in the scanner with eyes closed .
whole - brain imaging was performed on a 3t siemens skyra mri system ( siemens medical systems , erlangen , germany ) using a 32 - channel head coil .
bold - sensitive t2 * - weighted functional images were acquired using a single shot gradient - echo epi pulse sequence ( tr = 2500 ms , te = 27 ms , flip angle = 90degrees , 32 axial slices , 4.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 mm , distance factor 25 % , fov = 256 x 256 mm , interleaved slice ordering ) and corrected online for head motion .
the first two volumes were discarded to allow for t1 equilibration effects .
head motion was restricted using firm padding surrounding the head .
following functional imaging , a high resolution t1 scan was acquired for anatomic normalization .
preprocessing of functional and anatomical data followed the same procedure outlined in study 1 .
structural equation modeling the six facets of each personality variable were specified as indicators , resulting in five latent variables for analysis ( i.e. , neuroticism , extraversion , openness , agreeableness , and conscientiousness ; see fig. 2 ) .
the three intelligence test were averaged to form a composite variable .
intelligence was not modeled as a latent variable because the total number of latent variable indicators would have exceeded the number of estimated model parameters , leading to model convergence issues [ kline , 2011 ] .
intelligence , age , and gender were modeled as observed variables .
figure 2 sem from study 2 showing effects of the latent personality variables on dn efficiency .
all paths are standardized coefficients .
a : agreeableness ; c : conscientiousness ; dn : default network ; e : extraversion ; n : neuroticism ( emotional stability ) ; o : openness to experience .
results personality and the dn we first examined the associations of the big five traits with global efficiency of the dn. results revealed a large effect of openness to experience on global efficiency ( beta = 0.43 , p = 0.001 ; see fig. 1c ) .
openness was the only significant predictor of dn efficiency , although extraversion , agreeableness , and conscientiousness showed small and marginal effects .
we then added age , gender , and intelligence to the model with personality predicting dn global efficiency .
the effect of openness remained robust ( beta = 0.43 , p = 0.001 ) ; age , gender , and intelligence showed small and nonsignificant effects on dn global efficiency .
to explore facet - level effects , we ran separate regression models with each of the six openness facets ( openness to fantasy , aesthetics , feelings , actions , ideas , and values ) predicting dn global efficiency , controlling for age , gender , and intelligence .
all facets showed significant effects on dn efficiency , with the exception of aesthetics ( beta = 0.14 , p = 0.13 ) - - fantasy ( beta = 0.32 , p = 0.005 ) , feelings ( beta = 0.24 p = 0.02 ) , actions ( beta = 0.26 , p = 0.02 ) , ideas ( beta = 0.25 , p = 0.01 ) , and values ( beta = 0.31 , p = 0.001 ) .
discussion despite much research on the development and disorder of the dn , little is known about traits associated with normal variation in this core functional network .
here , we show for the first time that the functional organization of the dn is related to individual differences in openness to experience - - a normally distributed personality trait associated with imaginative , creative , and intellectual cognitive processes .
study 1 established the effect of openness on dn global efficiency ; study 2 replicated and extended this effect using a separate personality assessment in a culturally distinct population , controlling for several factors related to personality and brain function ( i.e. , intelligence , age , and gender ) .
taken together , these findings point to a biological basis of openness to experience , and suggest that normally distributed personality variables affect the functional organization of large - scale brain networks .
this work extends previous studies showing associations among personality factors and individual dn regions .
we used graph theory methods to model a whole - brain network of dn regions , thus permitting a fine - grained look at whether global network functioning is sensitive to variation in openness to experience , a core personality trait reflected in the general population .
our findings build on recent work using graph theory modeling of whole - brain structural and functional networks examining contributions of cognitive and personality factors [ davis et al. , 2013 ; sampaio et al. , 2014 ; servaas et al. , 2014 ; van den heuvel et al. , 2009 ] .
for example , van den heuvel et al .
[ 2009 ] found that fluid intelligence was inversely related to characteristic path length within a whole - brain functional network , pointing to an important role of individual differences in cognitive ability in predicting brain network efficiency .
such findings provide compelling evidence for a role of cognitive , personality , and creativity variables in shaping structural and functional brain systems [ beaty et al. , 2014 ; faust and kenett , 2014 ; kenett et al. , 2014 ; medaglia et al. , 2015 ; ryman et al. , 2014 ; van den heuvel et al. , 2009 ] .
future research should continue to explore factors underlying variation in neurocognitive network topology .
this study suggests that high - openness is related to a more efficiently functioning dn. we suspect that this relationship is due in part to the imaginative characteristics that define both openness and the dn. our findings are consistent with a large literature on the role of the dn in self - generated thought , such as mind - wandering , future thinking , and creative idea production [ andrews - hanna et al. , 2014 ; beaty et al. , in press ] .
thus , a more efficiently functioning dn may allow people high in openness to more effectively engage the neurocognitive processes associated with this network .
a defining feature of openness is creativity - - not only are open people more likely to self - report high levels of imagination [ deyoung , 2014 , 2015 ] , they also show superior performance on cognitive tasks that measure creative thinking [ beaty and silvia , 2013 ; jauk et al. , 2014 ] .
in this context , the ability to efficiently access the neurocognitive resources of the dn may partially account for the ability of highly open people to generate creative ideas .
past research suggests that openness is prone to change across development .
most notably , developmental research has reported a relative decline in self - reported openness in older adults [ roberts et al. , 2006 ] .
an interesting question for future research is to determine whether this age - related decline in openness corresponds to decreased dn efficiency .
another open question is whether openness underlies core mechanisms involved in domain - general imaginative processes , or whether its role is more specific to select features of the dn ( e.g. , future thinking , mental simulation , and creative cognition ) .
this question could be addressed with task - based fmri by assessing dn efficiency during various tasks requiring imaginative and sensory processing in a high - openness sample [ cf. passamonti et al. , 2015 ] , or by exploring whether openness and related cognitive abilities modulate brain network connectivity during cognitive tasks [ beaty et al. , 2015 ] .
such approaches can shed light on the extent to which normally distributed cognitive and personality traits affect the intrinsic architecture of large - scale brain systems .
1 we use the label " openness " to refer to the broader big five dimension encompassing both openness and intellect , except for when we discuss the distinct openness subscale in study 1 .
2 a hierarchical regression analysis was also conducted to determine whether openness and intellect differentially predict default network efficiency .
age and gender were entered in a first block , and the two scales were entered in a second block .
results showed nonsignificant effects of both openness and intellect on default network efficiency ; moreover , the change in r - squared was not significant .

deep - sea hypersaline anoxic basins and other hypersaline environments contain abundant and diverse microbial life that has adapted to these extreme conditions .
the bacterial candidate division kb1 represents one of several uncultured groups that have been consistently observed in hypersaline microbial diversity studies .
here we report the phylogeography of kb1 , its phylogenetic relationships to candidate division op1 bacteria , and its potential metabolic and osmotic stress adaptations based on a partial single cell amplified genome of kb1 from orca basin , the largest hypersaline seafloor brine basin in the gulf of mexico .
our results are consistent with the hypothesis - previously developed based on 14c incorporation experiments with mixed - species enrichments from mediterranean seafloor brines - that kb1 has adapted its proteins to elevated intracellular salinity , but at the same time kb1 apparently imports glycine betaine ; this compatible solute is potentially not limited to osmoregulation but could also serve as a carbon and energy source .
candidate division kb1 orca basin phylogeography genome hypersaline national science foundation10.13039 / 100000001ef - 0801742 introduction hypersaline environments are abundant on earth ( e.g. , boetius and joye , 2009 ) and include hypersaline lakes , such as the dead sea or the great salt lake ; evaporative lagoons ; salterns ; and hypersaline marine basins where salt deposits dissolve into deep - sea water and create distinct " lakes " of high - density brines on the seafloor of the red sea , mediterranean sea and gulf of mexico .
these deep - sea hypersaline anoxic basins ( dhabs ) have been the recent focus of molecular microbial investigation ( eder et al. , 2001 ; van der wielen , 2005 ; la cono et al. , 2011 ; yakimov et al. , 2013 ) .
in spite of their harsh conditions , 16s rrna gene sequencing surveys indicate that abundant and diverse microbial life has adapted to these extreme environments .
several uncultured groups were first observed in dhab microbial diversity studies , including the bacterial candidate division kb1 , the archaeal mediterranean seafloor brine lake group 1 ( msbl - 1 ) , and other ' msbl ' groups within the phylum proteobacteria .
since these uncultured , presumably halophilic groups mostly lack genomic analysis ( see mwirichia et al. , 2016 for a recent exception ) , their physiology and survival strategies have not been described ( antunes et al. , 2011 ) .
high - salinity environments are particularly challenging to microorganisms because biological membranes are sensitive to osmotic pressure , requiring cells to maintain a cytoplasmic solute concentration higher than that of the surrounding brine in order to prevent water loss .
there are two known strategies microorganisms use to prevent dehydration : the " salt in " strategy , where organisms actively pump salt into the cell ( usually k + and cl - ) and the contrasting " salt out " strategy , where organisms produce compatible organic solutes or transport them into the cytoplasm ( oren , 2008 ) .
it is also possible to utilize a combination of strategies ( e.g. , lai and gunsalus , 1992 ) .
microorganisms that predominantly use the " salt in " strategy also require special enzymatic adaptations , namely a higher proportion of acidic amino acids and a lower proportion of hydrophobic amino acids .
this same bias prevents normal enzymatic function at lower salinities and , therefore , " salt in " strategists have been documented to be specialists and true halophiles .
on the other hand , organisms predominantly using the " salt out " strategy produce and / or import organic - compatible solutes that do not require special intracellular protein adaptations ( oren , 2008 ) .
compatible solute production or transport can be regulated by the cell , allowing " salt out " strategists to live at a range of salinities .
however , compatible solute production is more energetically costly than maintaining high intracellular salt concentrations ( oren , 1999 ). of particular interest are the candidate division kb1 bacteria , commonly found in high - salinity anoxic environments .
kb1 was initially detected by 16s rrna gene sequencing from the kebrit deep brine basin in the red sea ( eder et al. , 1999 ) .
the uncultured kb1 bacteria were proposed to be responsible for assimilation of glycine betaine as carbon substrate .
enrichments from mediterranean seafloor brines ( lake medee ) contained a mixed microbial community that predominately yielded 16s rrna sequences associated with kb1 and the archaeal halophile msbl1 .
the enrichment incorporated high concentrations of 14c - labeled glycine betaine , which resulted in increased concentrations of trimethylamine in the media , suggesting possible cleavage of glycine betaine into acetate and trimethylamine ( yakimov et al. , 2013 ) .
here we report the phylogeography of kb1 , its phylogenetic relationships to candidate division op1 bacteria , and its potential metabolic roles and osmotic stress strategies based on a partial single cell amplified genome ( sag ) from orca basin , the largest hypersaline seafloor brine basin in the gulf of mexico ( shokes et al. , 1977 ; pilcher and blumstein , 2007 ) .
our results support the hypothesis that kb1 in orca basin has adapted its proteins to elevated salinity consistent with a " salt in " strategy ; its genome also encodes an uptake system for glycine betaine , which might be used not just for osmoregulation but also possibly as a carbon and energy source .
materials and methods sample collection and processing brine samples from the ca .
200 m thick brine layer in the southern orca basin were collected in april 2012 onboard the r / v pelican ( expedition pe12 - 22 ) at orca basin ( latitude 26.54.67 n , longitude 91.21.65 w , 2410 mbsf ) with niskin bottles attached to a rosette sampler equipped with a ctd .
brine was transferred to an argon - flushed sterile canning jar and aliquoted into an n2 - flushed sterile stoppered serum vial .
the brine sample was stored at 4degreesc and sent to the bigelow single cell genomics center ( east boothbay , boothbay , me , usa ) .
the sample was processed for single cell sorting followed by multiple displacement amplification of cellular dna and pcr screening of bacterial 16s rrna genes ( martinez - garcia et al. , 2012 ; stepanauskas , 2012 ) .
a cell identified as belonging to the kb1 group by 16s rrna gene screening was selected for further genome amplification and sequencing .
genome analysis the assembled genome was uploaded and analyzed with the rast ( aziz et al. , 2008 ) and img / er ( markowitz et al. , 2012 ) annotation servers .
selected putative protein - encoding genes were further investigated by blastp searching the ncbi non - redundant protein database ( altschul et al. , 1990 ) .
protein sequences were also acquired for comparison through uniprot1 and rast ( aziz et al. , 2008 ) .
amino acids were aligned using muscle ( edgar , 2004 ) .
the model selection tool was utilized in mega6 and trees were constructed with the maximum likelihood method ( tamura et al. , 2013 ) .
neighbor joining trees ( in supplementary material ) were constructed using a poisson correction with 1000 bootstrap replicates using mega6 ( tamura et al. , 2013 ) .
theoretical average protein isoelectric point analysis was performed by importing putative protein encoding genes from rast into expasy 's compute pi / mw tool2 .
gc profiles were determined and plotted as described previously ( gao and zhang , 2006 ) .
16s rrna phylogenetic analysis sequences classified as kb1 ( which includes both the kb1 and op1 candidate divisions ) in the silva non - redundant database ( ver .
119 ) ( pruesse et al. , 2007 ) were analyzed with the arb phylogenetic software package ( ludwig et al. , 2004 ) using raxml maximum likelihood ( stamatakis , 2006 ) .
database access the sag sequence is available in rast ( genome id 6666666.48888 ) and img / er ( img genome id 2654588133 ) .
results and discussion cell sorting and identification a total of 32 single cells from the orca basin brine sample yielded bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons .
16 cells represented the kb1 group , 13 were identified as deltaproteobacteria , 2 were assigned to the candidate phylum od1 ( elshahed et al. , 2005 ) and one to the bacteroidetes phylum .
these taxa were also observed in a sanger 16s rrna gene clone library from a previous research collection ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
the kb1 - associated sag with the lowest cp value ( 5:08 h ) , indicating the time the multiple displacement amplification reaches half - maximum fluorescence , was selected for genome sequencing .
phylogenetics and phylogeography of kb1 conflicting taxonomic classification schemes have obscured the phylogenetic status of kb1 and the related op1 .
the major taxonomic classifiers within silva ( ref 119 ) have assigned all op1 and kb1 - related organisms to one phylum , kb1 , and undefined lower - ranking taxonomic categories .
on the other hand , greengenes ( ver. 13.8 ) recently classified op1 and kb1 - related sequences into a single phylum , op1 ( mcdonald et al. , 2012 ) , while maintaining distinct class levels of op1 , kb1 , acetothermia , and msbl6 .
acetothermia has also been suggested as a phylum name for the entire op1 / kb1 complex ( rinke et al. , 2013 ) , based on a reconstructed genome obtained from the metagenome of a geothermal acidic stream ( takami et al. , 2012 ) .
our phylogenetic analyses of related sequences from the most recent non - redundant silva near - full length 16s rrna gene database ( version 119 ; quast et al. , 2013 ) found four distinct phylogenetic groups near the kb1 and op1 candidate phyla with high (> 80 %) bootstrap statistical support ( figure 1 ) .
the single - cell sequences from orca basin brine identified as kb1 in the silva 119 database formed a monophyletic group with the initial kb1 sequences from the red sea kebrit deep brine basin ( eder et al. , 1999 ) and with sequences from a wide range of other hypersaline habitats , including high salinity microbial mats , hypersaline lakes , solar salterns , and other deep - sea brine basins ( van der wielen , 2005 ; tkavc et al. , 2011 ; makhdoumi - kakhki et al. , 2012 ) ( figure 1 ) .

the tree is rooted with the deeply branching bacterium thermosulfidibacter tokaii , group names indicate greengenes class taxonomy .
the scale bar indicates the length of 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site .
the initial obsidian pool sequence opb14 ( af027045 ) ( hugenholtz et al. , 1998 ) formed a distinct monophyletic group with sequences from other high - temperature ( e.g. , ncbi accession eu645931 ) and hydrocarbon - influenced ( e.g. , eu542465 ) environments ; this group constitutes the op1 lineage sensu stricto ( hugenholtz et al. , 1998 ) .
the uncultured candidatus taxon acetothermum autotrophicum , reconstructed by metagenomic analysis from an acidic hot spring community ( takami et al. , 2012 ) , belonged to a cluster separate from the obsidian pool op1 clone sequences .
this separate , monophyletic cluster includes sequences from both high - temperature and hydrocarbon - impacted environments , and constitutes the acetothermia sensu stricto ( figure 1 ) .
the fourth monophyletic cluster is termed the mediterranean seafloor brine lake 6 ( msbl6 ) group , since it was initially found in 16s rrna gene sequencing surveys of mediterranean brine basins ( daffonchio et al. , 2006 ) ; the original sequence dataset is represented here by bannock basin clone dq289342 ( figure 1 ) .
since then , the msbl6 lineage has been populated by sequences from hydrocarbon - impacted environments , including cold seeps , sediments near sulfate - methane transition zones , and a methane - influenced brackish lake from which a partial single - cell genome [ sag scgcaaa255 - c06 ] was obtained ( rinke et al. , 2013 ) .
genome analysis of kb1 the orca basin kb1 - classified sag genome contained 709508 bp and was estimated to be 25 % complete based on the presence of 107 genes identified to be present in 95 % of bacterial genomes in the comprehensive microbial resource database ( dupont et al. , 2012 ; supplementary table 1 ) .
sequences for at least 12 trnas were found .
the gc content was 46.70 % ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
putative genes were identified for vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis and metabolism , a complete acetyl - coa ( wood - ljungdahl ) pathway , cell wall biosynthesis , rna protein metabolism , dna metabolism and repair , and fatty acid and lipid metabolism .
genes potentially related to oxidative stress response , heat and cold shock response , and glycine betaine transport were also identified ( supplementary table 2 ) .
osmotic regulation the osmotic regulation strategy of kb1 is of particular interest since the kb1 clade contains sequences exclusively from hypersaline environments .
kb1 contains genes potentially coding for uptake of compatible solutes such as glycine betaine or proline betaine , and for uptake of k + ( supplementary table 2 ) , indicating either intracellular accumulation of compatible solutes as a " salt out " strategist , accumulation of potassium salts as a " salt in " strategist , or a combination of both strategies ( oren , 2008 ) .
the distribution of predicted protein isoelectric points in the kb1 genome suggests that kb1 is adapted for using the " salt in " strategy ( figure 2 ) .
accumulation of salts , primarily k + , for osmotic regulation was first observed in halophilic archaea in the phylum halobacteria , and subsequently in the bacterium salinibacter ruber in the phylum bacteroidetes ( anton et al. , 2002 ; mongodin et al. , 2005 ) .
the predicted proteins inferred from these organisms' genomes contain a higher proportion of acidic amino acids than do proteins from microorganisms that do not accumulate intracellular salts ( mongodin et al. , 2005 ) .
the isoelectric point distribution of inferred proteins from the kb1 sag ( figure 2 ) indicated a preference for proteins with higher abundances of acidic amino acids ( 30 % pi 5.0 ) , similar to s. ruber , but proportionally fewer acidic amino acids than the extreme archaeal halophile , halobacterium ncr - 1 (~ 42 % pi 4.5 ) .
conversely , c. acetothermum autotrophicum within the acetothermia , and the partial sag genome scgc aaa255 - c06 in the msbl6 clade ( rinke et al. , 2013 ) , had protein isoelectric point abundance patterns similar to those of organisms that do not accumulate high concentrations of intracellular salts , including escherichia coli and desulfohalobium retbaense , a sulfate - reducing bacterium isolated from the hypersaline retba lake ( senegal , west africa ) thought to accumulate compatible solutes as its primary mechanism for osmoregulation ( spring et al. , 2010 ) .
figure 2 frequency of predicted isoelectric point ( nearest 0.5 ) of putative proteins in the genomes of the op1 / kb1 phylum complex and other halophilic and non - halophilic bacteria .
the plot includes orca basin kb1 ; sag scgcaaa255 - c06 from a methane and sulfide - rich zone of a brackish lake ( rinke et al. , 2013 ) , c. acetothermum autotrophicum ( takami et al. , 2012 ) , halobacterium nrc - 1 , a halophilic " salt in " archaeon ; salinibacter ruber , a " salt in " halophilic bacterium ; desulfohalobium retbaense , a " salt out " halophilic bacterium and escherichia coli k12 .
amino acids were further analyzed to determine which acidic amino acids ( glutamate or aspartate ) were contributing to the isoelectric point pattern in kb1 .
analysis of individual amino acid abundances in proteins inferred from orfs from the orca basin kb1 sag indicated that glutamate was more abundant than aspartate , which was only marginally higher in abundance than in the non - halophilic or " salt out " strategist bacteria analyzed .
however , bias for glutamate was not universal among the " salt in " strategists , as halobacterium contained higher concentrations of aspartate , while s. ruber contained elevated acidic amino acids , but near - equal proportions of glutamate and aspartate ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 frequency of amino acids in putative proteins in the genomes of the op1 / kb1 phylum complex and other halophilic and non - halophilic bacteria .
the plot includes orca basin kb1 ; sag scgcaaa255 - c06 from a methane - and sulfide - rich zone of a brackish lake ( rinke et al. , 2013 ) ; c. acetothermum autotrophicum ( takami et al. , 2012 ) ; halobacterium nrc - 1 , a halophilic " salt in " archaeon ; salinibacter ruber , a " salt in " halophilic bacterium ; desulfohalobium retbaense , a " salt out " halophilic bacterium .
utilization of glycine betaine in kb1 glycine betaine is among the most common compatible solutes produced and / or imported by " salt out " strategists in response to osmotic stress .
glycine betaine transport systems can aid cells in maintaining osmotic balance and are well studied in cultured isolates , including non - halophilic escherichia and salmonella species which use these specific transport systems to adapt to elevated salinity within non - extreme survival limits ( perroud and le rudulier , 1985 ; koo and booth , 1994 ) .
once in the cytoplasm , glycine betaine has several possible fates ( muller et al. , 1981 ; naumann et al. , 1983 ; moller et al. , 1984 ; heijthuijsen and hansen , 1989 ; watkins et al. , 2014 ) : it can be retained as a compatible solute , cleaved to acetate and trimethylamine ( naumann et al. , 1983 ; heijthuijsen and hansen , 1989 ) , or demethylated to dimethylglycine ( muller et al. , 1981 ; moller et al. , 1984 ) .
demethylation to glycine has been considered the dominant pathway in aerobic bacteria , while cleavage has been considered the dominant anaerobic pathway .
however , demethylation does occur in some anaerobes , such as marine sulfate - reducing bacteria ( van der maarel et al. , 1996 ) and marine methanogenic archaea ( watkins et al. , 2014 ) .
in some methylotrophic methanogenic archaea , demethylation of glycine betaine to dimethylglycine has been observed to be connected directly to methanogenesis ( watkins et al. , 2014 ) .
the orca basin sag kb1 contains a compact gene cassette potentially encoding a glycine betaine uptake system , specifically a 3 - protein proline or glycine betaine abc transporter system , prou ( genes provwx ) ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
neighbor - joining trees of the prou proteins ( prov , prow , prox ; supplementary figure s4 ) , and bootstrap analysis of the tree topologies showed that these proteins did not form well - supported phylogenetic lineages with prou protein sequences from known organisms .
interestingly , no recognizable glycine betaine uptake genes were observed in the nearly complete op1 - related genome of c. acetothermum autotrophicum ( takami et al. , 2012 ) , indicating that glycine betaine uptake may not be universal to all members of the kb1 and op1 clades .
however , since the orca basin kb1 contains these genes , we propose that glycine betaine utilization starts with importing glycine betaine into the cell via the atp binding cassette ( prou ; t.c. 3.a.1.12.1 ) .
once glycine betaine is inside the cell , the genes detected near the transporter system suggest different possible fates .
one possibility is demethylation and subsequent use of the methyl group as a carbon source via the acetyl - coa ( wood - ljungdahl ) pathway .
investigating the physiological and phylogenetic diversity of methyltransferases , ticak et al .
( 2014 ) recently provided evidence that a family of corrinoid - containing trimethylamine methyltransferases related to trimethylamine transferases in the methanogen methanosarcina spp. demethylate glycine betaine in desulfitobacterium hafniense y51 .
the trimethylamine methyltransferase protein was upregulated during growth of d. hafniense on glycine betaine , and spectrophotometric evidence suggested that the recombinant protein converted glycine betaine and cob ( l ) alamin to dimethylglycine and methylcobalamin .
possibly , one or several putative methyltransferases in kb1 have a similar function ( supplementary figure s5 ) .
a kb1 methyltransferase ( supplementary figure s3 and s5 ) could potentially transfer one of the methyl groups of glycine betaine to tetrahydrofolate , yielding dimethylglycine and 5 - methyl - tetrahydrofolate .
the fate of dimethylglycine remains unknown - no enzymes for dimethylglycine demethylation were found - but potential genes for glycine decarboxylase and sarcosine ( n - methylglycine ) oxidase were detected , indicating the possibility of complete demethylation to glycine ( supplementary figure s7 ) .
the methylated tetrahydrofolate could possibly enter the methyl branch of the wood - ljungdahl pathway ( kreher et al. , 2008 ; ragsdale and pierce , 2008 ) , since the necessary enzymes appear to be encoded in the kb1 genome ( supplementary figures s3 and s5 ; supplementary table 2 ) .
the pathway can , therefore , potentially be used in the oxidative direction if an appropriate electron acceptor ( e.g. , formate ) is available and able to be utilized by the organism ( kreher et al. , 2008 ) .
the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase complex and acetyl - coa synthase were also detected in the partial kb1 genome .
if the redox regime in the orca basin brine permits microorganisms to sustain the reductive acetyl - coa pathway that reduces co2 with formate or hydrogen , which is consistent with the thoroughly reducing conditions in surficial sediments in orca basin ( zhuang et al. , 2016 ) , the genomic evidence would allow the interpretation that glycine betaine provides kb1 with a source of c1 compounds for biosynthetic purposes ( supplementary figure s6 ) .
otherwise , kb1 may utilize one of the alternative pathways of glycine betaine catabolism .
yakimov et al .
( 2013 ) suggested that kb1 might produce both acetate and trimethylamine , and grow as a syntroph of methylotrophic archaea , following previous results that glycine betaine - metabolizing bacteria can form syntrophic associations with methylotrophic methanogens ( e.g. , king , 1984 ) .
enrichments dominated by kb1 and msbl1 16s rrna sequences incorporated 14c - labeled glycine betaine and produced trimethylamine following glycine betaine addition ( yakimov et al. , 2013 ) .
msbl1 were recently proposed to be mixotrophic sugar - fermenting organisms based on single cell genomic analysis ( mwirichia et al. , 2016 ) .
the cleavage enzyme ( glycine betaine reductase ) that traditionally produces acetate and trimethylamine was not detected in orca basin kb1 , but could not be discounted due to the fragmentary sag .
potentially , kb1 may utilize both demethylation and cleavage of glycine betaine , depending on environmental factors and potential syntrophic relationships .
phylogenetic analysis of acetyl - coa pathway genes and metabolic function phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated acetyl - coa pathway proteins carbon monoxide dehydrogenase ( subunit coos ) and the acetyl - coa synthase ( subunit acsb ) indicate monophyly of orca basin kb1 with c. acetothermum autotrophicum ( figure 4 ) .
complete enzymes of the acetyl - coa pathway have been recognized in the genome of c. acetothermum autotrophicum within the acetothermi group ( takami et al. , 2012 ) ( figure 1 ) .
figure 4 maximum likelihood tree of concatenated coos and acsb protein sequences in the acetyl - coa pathway , including the kb1 homolog [ peg248 ] to candidatus acetothermum autotrophicum .
the maximum likelihood tree was constructed with a lg model with gamma distribution and invariant sites ( lg + g + i ) determined by using the model selection tool in mega .
amino acid alignment positions with less than 20 % informative information ( including gaps ) were not considered .
scale bar indicates 0.1 amino acid substitutions per site .
bootstrap statistical support (> 50 %) based on 1000 replicates is displayed next to each node .
the acetyl - coa pathway is known to operate in both directions ( e.g. , hattori et al. , 2005 ) .
in c. acetothermum autotrophicum , it was proposed to function autotrophically by fixing co2 with h2 ( takami et al. , 2012 ) .
kb1 may also be able to utilize the pathway to fix co2 when carbon is scarce .
as a further possibility , kb1 may also produce acetyl - coa , in combination with heterotrophy ( schuchmann and muller , 2014 ) .
genes encoding the protein subunits of pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase ( ec 1.2.7.1 ) were also observed in the genome ( rast peg 635 - 637 ) indicating another possibility for production of acetyl - coa utilizing the wood - ljungdahl pathway , potentially in combination with methyl groups derived from glycine betaine demethylation ( supplementary figure s6 ) ( kreher et al. , 2008 ) .
several genes for acetyl - coa fermentation to butyrate were also present , though not all genes comprising the pathway were observed in the partial kb1 genome ( supplementary figure s8 ) .
implications the candidate division op1 / kb1 bacteria are deeply rooted on the tree of life ( takami et al. , 2012 ) .
the four distinct groups of the op1 / kb1 complex ( figure 1 ) were consistent with class - level taxa according to the greengenes taxonomic classification .
therefore , it is proposed to retain op1 , kb1 , msbl6 , and the acetothermia as four separate groups on class level which are combined into a single phylum ; this conservative solution should be preferable to the alternative of elevating these class - level taxa to four different phyla within a superphylum , analogous to previously proposed cases ( wagner and horn , 2006 ) .
the acidic amino acid bias indicated evolutionary change in kb1 from its common ancestor with op1 , allowing it to thrive under hypersaline conditions , and likely prohibiting it from living at low salt concentration .
the acetyl - coa pathway is potentially orthologous among kb1 and op1 , but glycine betaine uptake proteins and methyltransferases were possibly horizontally transferred .
kb1 evolved a unique combination of protein modifications and compatible solute uptake and utilization pathways to survive in hypersaline environments .

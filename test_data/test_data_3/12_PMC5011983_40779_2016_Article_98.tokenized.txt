background inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibds ) are group of chronic inflammatory illnesses with a remitting and relapsing course that may result in appreciable morbidity and high medical costs secondary to repeated hospitalizations .
the study 's objectives were to identify the reasons for hospitalization among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases , and compare inpatient courses and readmission rates for ibd - related admissions versus non - ibd - related admissions .
methods a retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with ibd admitted to the minneapolis va medical center between september 2010 and september 2012 .
results a total of 111 patients with ibd were admitted during the 2 - year study period .
ibd flares / complications accounted for 36.9 % of the index admissions .
atherothrombotic events comprised the second most common cause of admissions ( 14.4 %) in ibd patients .
patients with an index admission directly related to ibd were significantly younger and had developed ibd more recently .
unsurprisingly , the ibd admission group had significantly more gastrointestinal endoscopies and abdominal surgeries , and was more likely to be started on medication for ibd during the index stay .
the median length of stay ( los ) for the index hospitalization for an ibd flare or complication was 4 ( 2 - 8 ) days compared with 2 ( 1 - 4 ) days for the other patients ( p = 0.001 ) .
a smaller percentage of the group admitted for an ibd flare / complication had a shorter icu stay compared with the other patients ( 9.8 % vs. 15.7 % , respectively ) ; however , their icu loss tended to be longer ( 4.5 vs. 2.0 days , respectively , p = 0.17 ) .
compared to the other admission types , an insignificantly greater percentage of the group whose index admission was related to an ibd flare or complication had at least one readmission within 6 months of discharge ( 29 % versus 21 % ; p = 0.35 ) .
the rate of admission was approximately 80 % greater in the group whose index admission was related to an ibd flare or complication compared to the other types of admission ( rate ratio 1.8 , 95 % confidence interval 0.96 to 3.4 ) , although this difference did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.07 ) .
conclusion identifying the reasons for the patients' index admission , ibd flares versus all other causes , may provide valuable information concerning admission care and the subsequent admission history .
keywords inflammatory bowel diseases veteran affairs readmission rate noneissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibds ) are a group of chronic inflammatory illnesses with a remitting and relapsing course that may result in appreciable morbidity and high medical costs secondary to repeated hospitalizations .
the clinical management of ibd patients has improved due to increased understanding of the disease process and new therapies .
however , disease morbidity remains high , with an estimated mean annual direct health care cost per ibd patient in the us of roughly $ 8265 and $ 5066 for crohn 's disease ( cd ) and ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , respectively .
approximately 31 and 38 % of these costs , respectively , are directly attributed to acute hospitalization [ 1 ] .
within the department of veterans affairs ( va ) , there is an increasing burden of disease related to ibd .
a recent study using va administrative data found that the prevalence of crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis had increased 2 - to 3 - fold among veterans between 1998 and 2009 [ 2 ] .
the va population differs from the general us population due to combat exposure , male predominance , lower socio - economic status , and higher psychiatric comorbidities [ 3 ] , all of which can potentially affect ibd progression and treatment .
there is a paucity of data on inpatient resource utilization by veterans with ibd .
we sought to identify the reasons for hospitalization among patients with ibd and to compare the inpatient course and readmission rates for ibd - related admissions versus non - ibd - related admissions .
to this end , we conducted a clinical review of all patients admitted to the tertiary care va hospital in minneapolis , mn , usa , during the fiscal years 2010 and 2011 to assess the reasons for hospitalization , the inpatient course and readmissions .
methods a retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients with an ibd diagnosis admitted to the minneapolis va medical center between september 2010 and september 2012 .
ethics approval was granted for the chart review by the institutional review board at the minneapolis vamc .
patients were identified by the international classification of diseases version 9 ( icd - 9 ) diagnostic codes representing crohn 's disease ( 555.x ) and ulcerative colitis ( 556.x ) .
hospitalization data were identified for 132 unique patients .
subjects with missing data on the index hospitalization or patients determined not to have ibd on chart review ( n = 21 ) were excluded .
the patients' demographics and disease histories were obtained from the hospitalization and clinic notes in the electronic medical records .
the principle diagnosis for each hospitalization was ascertained by a physician based on the review of hospitalization records .
the criteria for defining an ibd flare / complication were as follows : any hospitalization requiring steroids or other widely accepted treatments for ibd , such as tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) inhibitors , and surgical procedures related to the intestinal tract .
in - hospital resource use was determined by los , intensive care unit use ( icu ) and recurrent hospitalizations within 6 months .
statistical analyses continuous variables were described by the mean and standard deviation of the distribution unless they were highly skewed , in which case the results were described using medians and interquartile ranges ( iqrs ) .
depending on the level of measurement and the data distributions , these groups were compared using a t - test , rank sum test or chi - square test .
six - month hospital readmission rates per 100 patient - months were estimated and compared using poisson regression .
results a total of 111 ibd patients were admitted during the 2 - year study period .
ibd flares / complications accounted for 41 ( 36.9 %) of the index admissions .
other reasons for admission included atherothrombotic events ( 14.4 %) , non - gi infections ( 9.0 %) , orthopedic surgery ( 6.3 %) , oncological reasons ( 5.4 %) , arrhythmia ( 4.5 %) , renal reasons ( acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease 2 / 2 ftt , hemodialysis complications ) ( 5.4 %) , pulmonary reasons ( copd , tracheobronchitis ) ( 3.6 %) , psychiatric reasons ( 2.7 %) , and miscellaneous causes ( other surgeries , non - stroke neurological reasons , elective procedure requiring admission , giardiasis ) ( 11.8 %) .
table 1 compares the characteristics of the patients whose index admissions were for an ibd flare or complication versus patients whose admissions were not directly related to ibd .
patients with an index admission directly related to ibd were significantly younger and had developed ibd more recently .
approximately half of each group had a psychiatric co - morbidity .
unsurprisingly , the ibd admission group had significantly more gastrointestinal ( gi ) endoscopies and abdominal surgeries and was more likely to be started on medications for ibd during the index stay .
the median los ( interquartile range ) for the index hospitalizations for an ibd flare or complication was 4 ( 2 - 8 ) days , whereas the los was 2 ( 1 - 4 ) days for the other patients ( p = 0.001 ) .
a smaller percentage of the group admitted for an ibd flare or complication had an icu stay [ 4 / 41 ( 9.8 %) vs. 11 / 70 ( 15.7 %)] ; however , their icu loss tended to be longer [ 4.5d ( 2 - 6.5d ) vs. 2d ( 1 - 2d ) , respectively ; p = 0.17 ] .
there were no in - hospital deaths .

to obtain these data , we analyzed the reasons for hospitalization and the utilization of inpatient healthcare resources by us veterans with ibd .
in this analysis , it became apparent that identifying the reason for the patient 's index admission ( ibd flare versus all other causes ) provided valuable information concerning admission care and the subsequent admission history .
several key findings deserve emphasis .
first , out of the 111 ibd patients admitted to the hospital over a 2 - year period , only approximately 1 / 3 of the admissions were for problems directly related to ibd ; the other 2 / 3 of the patients were admitted for a variety of non - ibd medical problems , most commonly atherothrombotic conditions .
because gastroenterologists tend to see patients with active ibd , problems with ibd flares tend to monopolize the attention of the physicians .
these admission data emphasize the frequency of non - ibd problems and the need for care directed to the entire gamut of medical conditions rather than a concentration simply on gastrointestinal problems. of particular interest was the frequency of atherothrombotic events in our patients with quiescent ibd .
previous studies have found an increased incidence of venous and arterial thrombotic events in ibd patients [ 4 ] , which may reflect the pro - thrombotic state that has been postulated to be caused by low - grade systemic inflammation [ 5 ] .
secondly , there was a strikingly increased prevalence of opiate usage by patients admitted with a flare ( 17 %) vs. only 4 % of patients admitted for non - ibd problems .
the 17 % prevalence seems high relative to targownik et al. , [ 6 ] who reported a maximum of 11 % of ibd subjects with an active opioid prescription in the first month following diagnosis , with this usage falling as the disease process came under control .
several factors have been shown to be associated with outpatient opioid use in ibd populations , including psychiatric comorbidities , such as depression and anxiety , a history of substance abuse , female gender , and clinical disease activity when measured by symptoms [ 7 , 8 ] .
almost half of our cohort had psychiatric comorbidities , which might account for the higher prevalence of opioid use in this population .
prior studies have also shown that opioid use may be associated with more severe disease [ 9 , 10 ] and may be independently related to poor outcomes [ 9 ] , although the cause or effect relationship remains to be determined .
finally , there are reports showing an overall increased prevalence of opioid use in veteran populations , although opiate use in veterans with ibd has not been previously studied [ 11 ] .
third , we found that patients admitted for ibd flares were more likely to have a longer los ( both in the icu and overall ) .
the average los reported by kappelman et al .
[ 1 ] was 6.7 days for cd and 6.9 days for uc , although this study did not identify the reasons for hospitalization .
the median los in our study was 4.0 days for an ibd flare and 2.0 days for other admissions , which was comparable to a recent swiss study showing a mean number of hospitalization days of 2.0 (+/ - 8.8 ) and 1.5 (+/ - 6.1 ) for cd and uc , respectively .
while it is tempting to speculate that the shorter hospitalizations reflect recent improvements in the medical management of ibd , confirmation of this speculation requires additional study .
it is well established that hospitalization for ibd exacerbations can be resource - intensive , primarily due to the number of surgical procedures performed in this group [ 1 ] .
we also found that patients admitted for ibd - related reasons were significantly more likely to undergo endoscopic and abdominal surgical procedures .
fourth , patients with ibd - related admissions were more likely to have significant changes in their medication profiles upon discharge from the hospital compared to patients with non - ibd - related admissions .
this issue raises concern over the possibility that a lack of appreciation of such changes among patients or poor communication of such changes to the outpatient providers could result in disease mismanagement and potential readmissions or urgent care visits .
a randomized clinical trial demonstrated that readmissions to hospitals were often related to deficiencies in coordination and communication within the health care system and with patients .
thus , we speculated that good transitional care interventions to systematically address communication and care - coordination and to promote self - management in patients admitted for ibd flares / complications could be of significant value .
the limitations of our study merit attention .
we relied on available clinical and administrative data to assess and account for differences in illness severity at the patient or hospital level .
thus , residual confounding cannot be ruled out .
additionally , we were unable to ascertain the necessity of hospitalization or the criteria used to decide to readmit .
it is possible that we underestimated the rate of readmission if the veteran was re - hospitalized at a different institution .
finally , the generalizability of our study may be limited by the clinical setting in which the observations were made .
some potential variability in patient populations served by other va facilities may limit the generalizability of our findings .
conclusion this study highlights the importance of identifying the reason for hospitalization among ibd patients .
patients admitted for ibd - related reasons are more resource intensive in terms of length of stay and use of surgical procedures .
additionally , there was a tendency towards a higher readmission rate in patients admitted for ibd - related problems opposed to the other patients , although the difference did not reach statistical significance .
this issue may require confirmation with a larger sample size .
finally , whether interventions focusing on care - coordination and communication at the time of transition of care ( i.e. , discharge from the hospital ) reduce the readmission rate in ibd patients should be addressed in a future study .

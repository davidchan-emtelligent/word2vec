background in general , studies on the diversity of strongylid nematodes in endangered host species are complicated as material obtained by non - invasive sampling methods has limited value for generic and species identification .
while egg morphology barely allows assignment to family , the morphology of cultivated infective third stage larvae provides a better resolution at the generic level but cannot be used for exact species identification .
morphology - based taxonomic approaches greatly depend on the examination of adult worms that are usually not available .
methods hookworm parasites in two european researchers , who participated in gorilla research in the central african republic , were expelled after anthelmintic treatment to the faeces , collected and morphologically examined .
a male worm discharged naturally from a wild bonobo ( pan paniscus ) in congo was also examined for comparison .
results two species of necator were identified in researchers' faecal material : necator americanus ( stiles , 1902 ) and n. gorillae noda & yamada , 1964 ; the latter species differed in having a smaller body , smaller buccal cavity and shorter spicules with spade - shaped membranes situated distally .
males of n. gorillae also possessed unusual cuticular thickenings on the dorsal side of the prebursal region of the body .
these characters , shared with the male worm from the bonobo , correspond well to the description of n. gorillae described from gorillas in congo .
conclusions based on the morphology of the hookworms recovered in this study and previous molecular analyses of larvae developed from both humans and western lowland gorillas ( gorilla gorilla gorilla ) from this locality , we conclude that the researchers became infected with gorilla hookworms during their stay in the field .
this is the first report of infection with a necator species other than n. americanus in humans .

in general , studies on their diversity in endangered host species are complicated as material obtained by non - invasive sampling methods has limited value for generic and species identification .
while egg morphology barely allows assignment to family , the morphology of cultivated infective third stage ( l3 ) larvae provides a better resolution at the generic level [ 3 ] but cannot be used for exact species identification .
morphology - based taxonomic approaches greatly depend on the examination of adult worms , which are mostly obtained only during necropsies and thus are lacking .
as a result dna - based taxonomy suffers from the absence of comparative sequences from well - identified individuals .
until recently , it was believed that necator americanus ( stiles , [ 4 ] ) is the only species of necator parasitic in humans [ 5 ] .
however , hasegawa et al .
[ 6 ] recently proved by dna sequence analysis from infective third stage larvae raised from faecal cultures that at least two necator spp. are shared by humans , western lowland gorillas gorilla gorilla gorilla savage , and central chimpanzees pan troglodytes troglodytes blumenbach , in the tropical forest in dzanga sangha protected areas ( dspa ) , central african republic ( car ) .
the l3 larvae sequenced showed morphological characteristics of necator spp. , having a distinct spear - like structure in the buccal cavity and clear transverse striations on the sheath [ 3 ] .
however , it was impossible to assign the larvae to species based on their morphology .
based on the dna sequence profile ( its rdna and cox1 mtdna ) , one of the detected species was considered as typical n. americanus , while the taxonomic placement of the second taxon was impossible and was referred to as necator sp. after returning from the field survey of gorillas in dspa ( car ) , three european researchers were diagnosed with hookworm infections .
dna sequencing on the l3 larvae cultured from two of them suggested a mixed infection with n. americanus and other necator spp. we attempted to collect the adult hookworms from their faeces after anthelmintic treatment .
here we present the morphology of the hookworms recovered as the first report of a species of necator other than n. americanus from humans .
methods all procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and / or national research committee ( ethical commission of the biology centre of the academy of sciences of the czech republic ) and with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards .
two researchers studying western lowland gorillas in dspa ( car ) were coproscopically diagnosed positive for strongylid nematodes .
both were treated by albendazole ( 400 mg , a single dose ) and all expelled faeces during and 2 days after the treatment were collected and fixed in 4 % formaldehyde solution .
researcher a : a 23 - year - old woman who spent nine months in the field in dspa from november 2010 to august 2011 .
hookworm infection was diagnosed 11 months after returning from car .
researcher b : a 37 - year - old woman who has repeatedly participated in dspa field research for 2 - 3 month periods in 2007 - 2012 .
she was diagnosed with hookworm infection in october 2012 .
fixed faeces were washed with running tap water on piled strainers with a mesh aperture size of 2.8 mm , 1.00 mm , 0.60 mm , 0.25 mm , and 0.106 mm , respectively .
the remaining residue on each strainer was transferred to a glass dish , examined under a stereomicroscope for the presence of nematodes ; the worms collected were preserved in 70 % ethanol .
for light microscopy examination , the nematodes were cleared in glycerol - ethanol solution by evaporation of ethanol , and mounted on glass slides with 50 % glycerol aqueous solution , or cleared in lactophenol solution .
the spicules were excised from one worm using a fine needle to observe its distal ends .
all measurements are based on glycerol - mounted specimens and are presented in micrometres unless indicated otherwise .
drawings are made with the aid of a nikon drawing tube attached to a nikon optiphot microscope equipped with interference contrast .
comparative material examined : a single male adult of necator gorillae from the bonobo pan paniscus schwarz from wamba , congo , fixed in 4 % formaldehyde solution ; 20 male and 20 female n. americanus adult worms from a woman in oita , japan already identified [ 7 ] .
the specimens are deposited at the department of pathology and parasitology , university of veterinary and pharmaceutical sciences , brno ( czech republic ) under accession numbers vfunk1 , vfunb1 - vfunb16 .
results seventeen individuals of necator spp. were recovered from the researcher a and a single worm was recovered from researcher b. these were identified as two species based on detailed morphological study as described below .

remarks the worms identified as n. americanus in the present study were morphologically identical to n. americanus collected from a woman in japan , including the cephalic structure and distal ends of the spicules [ 9 , 10 ] .
the presence of n. americanus in the same material from researcher b was previously proved by sequence analysis of dna from l3 larvae raised by coproculture [ 6 ] .
we compared the specimens of n. gorillae identified in our study with the species previously described in great apes [ 11 , 12 ] , i.e. n. exilidens cummins , [ 13 ] , n. congolensis gedoelst , [ 12 ] and n. gorillae noda & yamada , [ 8 ] .
necator exilidens differs from the other two species in the shape of the mouth , the length of the spicules and the shape of the ventral cutting plates .
necator exilidens has spindle - shaped mouth whereas the mouth in the other two species has an ovoidal shape .
the spicules of n. exilidens are also more than twice as long ( 1,360 mum ) in comparison with those of n. congolensis and n. gorillae ( both < 600 mum ) .
all male specimens of n. gorillae recovered in our study possess spicules shorter than 600 mum with distal small spade - shaped membrane with fine lines .
ventral cutting plates of n. exilidens are round ( vs angular in the other species ) .
because of all of these characteristics , the distinction of the present material from n. exilidens is apparent .
the difference between n. congolensis and n. gorillae comprises the absence of dorsal cutting plates in n. congolenses , which are present in n. gorillae examined here .
the most important aspect which distinguishes n. gorillae from other necator spp. is the presence of prebursal dorsal cuticular thickenings ; these ridges do not seem to be resulting from body constriction as the subcuticle layer showed no wrinkles .
this is in sharp contrast with the almost smooth dorsal cuticle in n. americanus ( fig. 2a ) and other previously described species [ 12 ] .
the prebursal dorsal thickenings have been described only for n. gorillae collected from a wild western lowland gorila , which was caught in congo , transported to japan and died soon after arrival [ 8 ] .
additionally , the male hookworm from the comparative bonobo material shared morphological characteristics with n. gorillae ( figs. 1a , 2 g ) and we assume these to be conspecific .
other morphological features and measurements of the male n. gorillae from the researcher and the bonobo also agree well with those of n. gorillae .
in the original description of n. gorillae by noda & yamada [ 8 ] , the buccal capsule was given as 66 - 68 x 58 - 60 mum in males and 68 - 74 x 60 - 66 in females , i.e. much smaller than in the present worms identified as n. gorillae .
however , the buccal cavity of the male shown in fig. 2 in noda & yamada [ 8 ] measures 88 x 80 mum , i.e. almost equal to that in males of n. gorillae described here from humans and the bonobo .
finally , the morphology of the spicules of n. gorillae , as described by noda & yamada [ 8 ] , corresponds to that observed by us in the worms identified as n. gorillae , regardless of some terminological inconsistencies .
discussion the species composition of necator spp. parasitising african great apes is complex and remains unclear .
four species , i.e. necator americanus , n. exilidens ( from a chimpanzee ) , n. congolensis ( from chimpanzees in congo ) and n. gorillae ( from western lowland gorilla in congo ) , have been described [ 4 , 8 , 12 , 13 ] .
the key distinguishing features of the above - mentioned species are not clear , especially those of n. exilidens , n. congolensis and n. gorillae .
as the type - material of these species is not available at the present time , direct comparison with our specimens was impossible .
nevertheless , the original description of n. gorillae outlined by noda & yamada [ 8 ] is detailed enough to allow thorough morphological comparison as presented above .
this study is a follow up to previous work by hasegawa et al .
[ 6 ] , who described the dna sequence profile ( its and cox1 ) of l3 larvae raised from stools of researchers and confirmed that researchers ( and great apes ) at dspa were infected with more than one species of necator .
initially identified necator spp. clustered in both rdna and mtdna trees with n. americanus , the most common human - infecting species of necator ; this corresponds well to the presence of adult n. americanus described in our study .
the present specimens of n. americanus exhibited identical morphology with those expelled from the japanese woman [ 7 ] .
it is also noteworthy that necator sp. with its2 sequence closely resembling the type iii previously recorded from a human in dspa [ 6 ] , was recently found in bonobo from the congo [ 14 ] .
other genotypes / haplotype groups , dominant among larvae obtained from gorillas and chimpanzees , but present also in humans , were suggested to belong to other previously described great ape hookworm taxa i.e. , n. congolensis , n. exilidens or n. gorillae [ 6 ] .
based on the morhological data obtained and presented in this manuscript , the necator specimens , different from n. americanus and shared by researchers and gorillas at dspa , are identified as n. gorillae .
the possible synonymy of n. gorillae with n. congolensis ( and possibly also with n. exilidens ) cannot be ruled out , regardless of the fact , that the two latter species were described from chimpanzees .
interestingly , at the time of the original description of n. congolensis by gedoelst [ 12 ] , the bonobo has not yet been described as a distinct species .
it is probable , that at least one of the two " chimpanzees " that were the source of the type - material of n. congolensis originated from busira region in congo , which is , in fact , an area inhabited by bonobos .
nematode identification has traditionally relied on morphometric data and comparison of morphological structures ; morphology - based diagnostics of the nominal species should be further extended by molecular data [ 15 ] .
taxonomy is currently dealing with an explosion of sequence , genomic , proteomic and other molecular data [ 16 ] .
however , the fact that the genomic sequences deposited in databases ( embl , genbank , etc. ) sometimes refer to misidentified or unidentified organisms complicates analyses [ 17 ] .
each dna sequence should ideally be accompanied by comprehensive identification of the specimen [ 17 - 19 ] .
however , this is difficult to achieve with no clear taxonomic check on the name given to a sequence and usually no reference material is retained [ 17 ] .
moreover , sequences from the majority of nominal nematode taxa are missing [ 15 ] .
generally , the holotype which is declared as the ' name - bearing ' specimen is too valuable to be ground - up for dna isolation .
furthermore , type - specimens have often been preserved ( sometimes for centuries ) with fixatives prejudicial to the preservation of nucleic acid .
as such , frequently , the types are absent .
the example of necator spp. in primates and humans shows two possible options in resolving this dilemma .
we can give up traditional taxonomy and rely on otus based on derived sequences .
this approach is broadly used for avian malaria parasites [ 20 ] .
alternatively , a maximum effort should be made to collect new well - preserved material , which will be identified by experts and subsequently sequenced .
the second challenging option is the only way to continue using the traditional taxonomy important for parasites such as hookworms .
this will largely depend on the collaboration between laboratories , institutions , field researchers and wildlife veterinarians studying great apes and their parasites .
conclusions dna sequences of l3 larvae showed plural species of necator in both humans and great apes in the central african republic previously .
based on morphological analyses , we identified the adult hookworms recovered from the faeces of two researchers , in which larvae where also included and identified by hasegawa et al .
[ 6 ] , as n. gorillae and n. americanus .
this is the first report , supported by the morphology of adult worms , of a species of necator other than n. americanus in humans .
in order to maintain traditional nematode diagnostics we urge collection of new well - preserved adults suitable for both morphological and molecular examination .

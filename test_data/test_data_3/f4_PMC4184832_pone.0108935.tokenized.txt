we evaluated eye lenses as potential recorders of stable isotope histories in fish because they consist of metabolically inert optical proteins that are deposited in successive , concentric circles ( laminae ) much like otolith circuli and tree rings .
we conducted four different tests on lenses from red snapper , red grouper , gag , and white grunt .
the first test was a low - resolution screening of multiple individuals ( 4 - 5 radial groups of laminae per lens , all species except white grunt ) .
along the radial axis , all individuals exhibited substantial isotopic variability .
red snapper individuals separated into two groups based on delta 15n and gag separated into two groups based on delta 13c .
two gag with the greatest variation were chosen for high - resolution temporal analysis using individual laminae from their second eye lenses .
the first - order patterns from the high - resolution analysis generally mimicked patterns from the low - resolution screening of grouped laminae , yet the high - resolution plots revealed early - life details that were not apparent in the low - resolution screenings .
for the third test , left - versus right - eye variation was compared using high - resolution methods .
white grunt left - and right - eye radial isotopic patterns were almost identical for both delta 13c and delta 15n , suggesting the variations observed among individual fish were not artifacts .
the final test evaluated intra - laminar variation ; multiple samples were analyzed from different parts of the same lamina .
seven laminae from three individuals of two species were analyzed in this manner ; variations among laminae were found to be much higher than variations within laminae .
however , nominal intra - laminar variations were comparable to nominal differences between left and right lenses , suggesting intra - laminar variation established measurement precision .
eye lens isotopes appear to be useful for reconstructing the isotopic histories of individual fish ; these histories can be compared with spatially - derived isoscapes to reconstruct individual histories for site fidelity , movement and trophic position .

introduction internally recorded stable - isotope histories can be used to recreate lifelong trends in animal diets , trophic dependences , and movement within isotopically variable landscapes [ 1 ] - [ 5 ] .
such lifelong records are difficult to obtain because most tissues undergo metabolic turnover , and this turnover places limits on the retrospective time period that can be investigated [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
otoliths , fish scales , and vertebrae are tissues currently used to provide life - history records for fish .
otoliths are used to determine fish age and to reconstruct aquatic environments [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
otoliths grow during the entire life of the fish and consist of calcium carbonate deposited within a proteinaceous matrix .
otolith protein is generally not abundant enough ( 3 - 4 % by weight ) to allow retrospective delta 15n comparisons [ 10 ] .
fish scales grow during most of the life of the fish and provide a nonlethal way to measure isotopic ratios .
fish scales overlap old organic material with new material during growth in a phenomenon called " overplating " [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
overplating affects isotopic ratios by combining isotopic values from new and old material ; scales may not provide a true representation of isotopic information on a temporal scale [ 11 ] .
some researchers have explored the use of vertebrae in sharks for stable - isotope analyses with encouraging results [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] .
the collagen extracted from cartilaginous vertebrae is preserved because cartilage has low metabolic activity ( little or no turnover ) and it deposits in sequential layers [ 17 ] .
however , this approach cannot be applied to the vertebrae of bony fishes because bone collagen is reworked over time [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
although this paper focuses on fish , it should be noted that there are a number of isotopic records for terrestrial animals as well .
these include claws , hooves , hair , feathers , and teeth [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
although these tissues are isotopically conservative , the period of time represented by the record varies with tissue wear ( e.g. claws , hooves ) and replacement ( e.g. feathers , hair ) [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
some tissues can be sampled non - invasively on a regular basis to create a long - term isotopic record , but require recapture of the same animal on a regular basis [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
in this paper , we evaluate fish eye lenses as potential recorders of the isotopic histories of individual fish ; the eye lenses of squid ( invertebrates ) also appear to have this potential [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
vertebrate eye lenses are largely composed of different forms of a structural protein , crystallin , that develop in layers ( laminae ) at the outer lens as the animal grows [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
during the mid - to - late gastrula stage , lens cells derive from surface ectoderm and differentiate into two cell types , lens epithelial cells and fiber cells [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , although bloemendal considered all lens cells to be epithelial [ 26 ] .
at the surface of the lens , epithelial cells form a one - cell - thick outer layer ( lens epithelium ) adjacent to the fiber cells .
fiber cells remove their cytoplasmic organelles , including the cellular nucleus and its dna , to establish and maintain optical transparency within the lens [ 22 ] - [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] .
this process is a specialized form of apoptosis known as " attenuated " apoptosis , where the organelles are removed from the cell over a period of days , leaving behind the crystallin and other proteins [ 25 ] , [ 28 ] .
attenuated apoptosis is different from " classical " apoptosis in which everything , including the cell membrane , is degraded [ 25 ] .
fish eye lenses are spherical , and lens fiber cells are laid down in concentric layers much like the layers of an onion [ 22 ] - [ 24 ] .
fiber cells increase in length as the animal grows , but the increase in length is a step function of lens radius rather than a continuous increase , and this step function creates the physical discontinuities that are visible between adjacent laminae [ 22 ] , [ 27 ] .
the oldest part of the lens is at the center ( lens nucleus ) ; the nuclear fiber cells are among the oldest cells in the body [ 25 ] .
the outermost margin of the lens is the youngest material in the lens .
de novo protein synthesis ceases following attenuated apoptosis [ 22 ] .
crystallins and other lens proteins are rich in both carbon and nitrogen , and thus are suitable for delta 13c and delta 15n analysis ; this contrasts with otoliths , which are nitrogen - poor .
eye lenses thus have the potential to allow reconstruction of lifetime delta 13c and delta 15n histories and their associated ecological interpretations .
to investigate variation in fish eye - lens stable isotopes , we selected fish species that occur in geographic locations that had already been the subject of isotopic mapping ( isotope maps are known as " isoscapes ") .
this allowed comparison of any observed isotopic trends within the fish eye lenses with a known range and pattern of isotopic variation documented by radabaugh et al .
[ 29 ] .
four species ( red snapper , red grouper , gag , white grunt ) were selected that have life histories that are geographically bracketed between the polyhaline coastal zone and the outer continental shelf , a region that coincides with the radabaugh et al. isoscapes ( we avoided estuarine , strongly estuary - dependent , and highly migratory species ) .
we were otherwise limited to specimens that became available near the time of analysis , as no specimens were collected for the sole purpose of conducting the present study .
we expected trophic positions to increase with age ( as mouth gape increases ) , which generally causes delta 13c and delta 15n to increase with age [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
we conducted four tests to investigate variation in fish eye - lens isotopes ( delta 13c , delta 15n ) .
first , we conducted a low - resolution comparison of a small number ( 4 - 5 ) of eye - lens layers ( groups of laminae ) to determine if there was enough isotopic variation during life to warrant further study , with the specific objective being to compare lifetime isotopic variation with isoscapes recently produced by radabaugh et al .
[ 29 ] , therein possibly providing insight into changes in fish movement and trophic position during life .
after discovering that substantial , measurable isotopic variation did exist within the lenses , we used the remaining , second lens to conduct high - resolution comparisons , dissecting ( delaminating ) the second lens into as many thin layers ( hereafter referred to as " laminae ") as was practical , and comparing the high - resolution results with the coarse patterns from the first test .
we then compared high - resolution patterns in the left and right lenses of an additional specimen to investigate repeatability .
finally , we examined intra - laminar variation to identify the level of inherent variability ( precision ) in the method .
materials and methods ethics statement no fish were collected or killed for the purpose of this study .
all tissues were collected post - mortem according to a protocol ( is00000504 ) approved by the university of south florida institutional animal care and use committee .
none of the sampled species are protected except by recreational and commercial harvest regulations .
fish were obtained from surveys conducted by the florida fish and wildlife commission ( fwc ) and from a licensed charter - fishing vessel operating within state and federal regulatory guidelines in waters no more than 80 km distant from john 's pass , madeira beach , florida .
lens collection and dissection four red grouper ( epinephelus morio ) and three gag ( mycteroperca microlepsis ) were obtained from an fwc survey conducted 9 - 10 july , 2013 .
eight red snapper ( lutjanus campechanus ) were obtained from john 's pass charter vessels on 10 september , 2013 and one white grunt ( haemulon plumierii ) was obtained from a charter vessel on 11 june , 2013 .
whole eyes were removed by severing the sclera at its junction with the optic nerve and by severing the rectus ( orbital ) muscles near their junction with the sclera .
eyes were wrapped in aluminum foil , placed in plastic bags on ice , and frozen at - 40degreesc upon return to the laboratory .
eyes were thawed individually before dissection .
after thawing , an incision was made with a scalpel to create a flap in the cornea , which was folded back to allow removal of the lens using forceps .
exterior tissue and vitreous material were manually removed using a deionized water rinse .
the rinsed lens , which contained the lens nucleus , cortex , and lens epithelium together as one cohesive unit ( whole lens ) , was then placed on a glass petri dish where successive layers of cortical laminae were separated using two pairs of fine - tip forceps under a dissecting stereomicroscope , leaving the lens nucleus as the final tissue in the analyzed series .
the lens nucleus did not visibly delaminate further when crushed .
because the total number of cortical laminae varied with lens diameter ( age ) , the convention for numbering laminae started with the lens nucleus as 1 , with assigned numbers increasing toward the outer lens margin .
lamina removal ( delamination ) started near one lens pole and proceeded to the other , always starting the removal process at the same pole ( note that the " anterior - posterior " polar axis referred to in studies of the human eye applies to forward - oriented eyes ; most fish have laterally oriented eyes , and thus the homolog of the human anterior - posterior polar axis is usually mediolateral in fish , with the anterior pole and associated primary sutures being oriented laterally ) .
some forms of crystallin are water - soluble [ 26 ] , [ 32 ] ; deionized water was used sparingly to assist delamination .
after each delamination , an ocular micrometer was used to measure the diameter at the equator ( to nearest 0.1 mm ) ; the equator was identified as the largest diametric measurement that could be made perpendicular to the ( mediolateral ) polar axis .
lamina position is the radial midpoint of the lamina ( in mm ) on the equator , where the midpoint is the lens radius after lamina removal plus half the thickness of the removed lamina .
lens sample processing four types of isotopic variation were plotted : 1 ) low - resolution screening plots , 2 ) high - resolution plots for selected , screened individuals , 3 ) plots of left vs. right eyes , and 4 ) plots of variation within individual laminae ( intra - laminar variation ) .
for low - resolution screening , eye lenses were separated into 4 - 5 sections using fine - tip forceps , with multiple laminae intentionally included within each section ; the number of true laminae constituting each section was not known .
for all other tests , an effort was made to subdivide the lenses into the smallest thicknesses that were manually practical (" laminae ") .
individual sections and laminae were stored separately in 1 - dram glass vials .
laminae became desiccated in < 1 h at 25degreesc , after which most samples were homogenized using a mortar and pestle ; exceptions were laminae that were haphazardly selected for intra - laminar variation analysis , which were subdivided first and then homogenized .
dried laminae were weighed to the nearest microg on an analytical balance .
a dry weight of 300 - 600 microg of material was placed in tin capsules for combustion and isotopic analysis .
13c / 12c and 15n / 14n and c : n were measured in replicate using a carlo - ebra na2500 series ii elemental analyzer coupled to a continuous - flow thermofinnigan delta + xl isotope ratio mass spectrometer at the university of south florida college of marine science in st. petersburg , florida .
the lower limit of quantification was 12 microg c or n. calibration standards were nist 8573 and nist 8574 l - glutamic acid standard reference materials .
analytical precision , obtained by replicate measurements of nist 1577b bovine liver , was +/ - 0.11 / 1000 for delta 13c and +/ - 0.19 / 1000 for delta 15n ( average standard deviations of n = 30 replicates ) .

in all comparisons except for the intra - laminar comparison , replicate isotope measurements were averaged and plotted for descriptive purposes .
in the intra - laminar comparison , the objective was to determine if inter - laminar variation was greater than intra - laminar variation ; individual replicate isotope measurements were compared among laminae using one - way anova .
individual laminae were compared using 95 % tukey hsd intervals as a multiple range test ( statgraphic centurion , v. 16.2.04 ) .
in all comparisons , means and replicates were plotted without any exclusion .
results low - resolution screening analyses were conducted for eight red snapper , four red grouper , and three gag .
all individuals had variable isotopic values among lens layers ( figure 1 ) .
the majority of values were centered within ranges reported by radabaugh et al .
[ 29 ] for trawl - caught demersal fishes on the west florida shelf ( - 19 - - 14 / 1000 delta 13c ; 7 - 13.5 / 1000 delta 15n ) .
red snapper appeared to form two groups based on their delta15n values ; fish 45 and 47 ( figure 1 ) had consistently high delta 15n values .
there were no clear groupings in red grouper .
gag 2 had higher delta 13c values for its innermost layer than the other two gag , and all three gag had isotopic values that converged in the outermost layers .

rapid screening of specimens to detect large - scale differences in isotopic history .
each plotted line is a different specimen ; lines are labeled with specimen numbers .
gag 2 and 38 were analyzed using high - resolution analysis to further evaluate the difference recorded in the innermost layers .
the second lens from gag 2 ( 3.1 mm radius ) was dissected into 14 laminae plus a lens nucleus of 0.65 mm radius , indicating an average laminar thickness of 175 microm .
the second lens from gag 38 ( 3.2 mm radius ) was dissected into 16 laminae plus a lens nucleus of 0.60 mm radius , indicating an average laminar thickness of 163 microm .
when data from the two lenses were combined , dry weight ( dw , in mg ) increased as dw = 3.24r 3 ( n = 32 , r 2 = 0.99 , p < 0.0001 ) , where r is lens radius in mm. the mean dry density of these two gag lenses was 0.89 mg mm - 3 .
laminar thickness varied at a sub - annual scale in these two specimens , but did not have a strong positive or negative overall relationship with lens radius ( slope p > 0.05 ) .
the exponential ( cubic ) increase in average laminar weight that accompanies increasing lens size translates into a mass - balanced bias toward outer laminae when groups of laminae are processed together as a collective layer ( e.g. , during low - resolution screening analysis ) .
the innermost layer from the screening analysis was most likely to be misrepresentative of patterns observed in the high - resolution analysis ( figure 2 ) .
nevertheless , the screening method indicated different incipient delta 15n values for gag 2 and 38 , and this difference was borne out by the high - resolution analysis , albeit at a nominally lower difference ( 2.5 vs. 3.0 / 1000 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0108935.g002 figure 2 low - and high - resolution comparison .
the low - resolution screening method ( analysis of coarse lens layers ) is compared with the high - resolution method ( analysis of individual laminae ) for gag 2 ( upper panels ) and gag 38 ( lower panels ) .
the leftmost observation in the high - resolution method is for the lens nucleus ; the remaining observations are for individual laminae .
gag 2 was 704 mm total length ( tl ) ; gag 38 was 832 mm tl. both were female .
the left lens of white grunt 2 was dissected into 12 laminae plus the lens nucleus .
the radius of the left lens nucleus was 0.50 mm and the radius of the whole left lens was 2.85 mm , indicating a mean laminar thickness of 196 microm .
the right lens was dissected into 13 laminae plus the lens nucleus .
the radius of the right lens nucleus was 0.60 mm and the radius of the whole right lens was 2.88 mm , indicating a mean laminar thickness of 175 microm .
isotopes in both eyes were centered within ranges reported by radabaugh et al .
[ 29 ] , and delta 15n increased during life ; this latter trend was observed in 15 of the 16 fish examined ( 94 % , with red snapper 45 being the sole exception ) .
isotopic patterns were very similar between left and right eyes ( figure 3 ) , yet plotted pairings of radial midpoints in figure 3 , average laminar thicknesses ( 196 vs. 175 microm ) , and the difference in total lamina count ( 12 vs. 13 ) were not in perfect agreement .
one - way anova indicated inter - laminar variation ( figure 4 ) was much larger than intra - laminar variation for both delta 13c [ f ( 6,16 ) = 40.6 , p < 0.0001 ] and delta 15n [ f ( 6,16 ) = 232.4 , p < 0.0001 ] .

lamina number ( e.g. , l8 = lamina 8 ) is indicated within lamina identifiers .
data points have been horizontally jittered for clarity , and are summarized by means ( diamonds ) with 95 % tukey hsd intervals .
a total of 197 samples were analyzed ( 72 sections , 125 laminae ) .
the range of mass c : n was 2.72 - 3.37 .
the mass c : n mean value was 2.97 +/ - 0.12 ( molar c : n range = 3.17 - 3.39 ; mean = 3.46 +/ - 0.14 ) .
the c : n ratio was consistently < 3.5 ; therefore , no lipid correction or normalization was needed because the lipid concentrations were uniformly low [ 33 ] .
discussion the results indicate low - resolution isotopic screening has strong potential as an index of broad - scale changes in the isotopic history of individual fish .
broad - scale changes were evident in all species , yet red snapper and gag appeared to originate from distinct groups that converged later in life ( all fish were collected from the same geographic region ) .
the magnitude of isotopic variation observed in both the low - and high - resolution tests ( figures 1 - 3 ) matches the scale of variation in isoscapes produced by radabaugh et al .
[ 29 ] for the west florida shelf , the region from which the fish in our tests were collected .
the low - resolution screening tests were rapid and cost - effective , but sometimes missed important life events .
in the case of the gag ( figure 2 ) , the missed detail involved early life history ; for gag 2 , the low - resolution analysis had a starting value of - 13.8 / 1000 for delta 13c while the high - resolution analysis was variable , starting at - 16.4 and increasing to - 12.9 / 1000 .
the high - resolution approach contains the most information that can be obtained practically using the manual delamination method .
the white grunt 's left and right eyes identified very similar lifelong trends ( figure 3 ) , suggesting the temporal trends observed in the other comparisons ( e.g. , figure 1 ) were repeatable and were not artifacts .
the scale of variability between left and right eyes was similar to that of intra - laminar variation .
most intra - laminar variation was less than the instrument error calculated using bovine liver (+/ - 0.11 / 1000 for delta13c ; +/ - 0.19 / 1000 for delta15n ,) .
small , intra - laminar variation likely imparts a limit to the precision of the overall method .
all of the values and trends in the eye - lens isotopes are consistent with expected life - history patterns and trophic positions , as interpreted using published delta 13c and delta 15n isoscapes for demersal fish muscle [ 29 ] .
isoscapes visually portray spatial isotopic variation within natural systems [ 34 ] .
while many terrestrial isoscapes exist , a need exists for developing more marine isoscapes [ 35 ] .
when eye - lens isotopes are compared to observed and modeled isoscapes for demersal fish muscle on the west florida shelf [ 29 ] , [ 36 ] , it appears that the two red snapper with higher delta 15n ( figure 1 ) traveled from the northern end of a delta 15n latitudinal gradient , and those with lower delta 15n traveled from or remained within more southerly waters .
isoscape trends in delta 13c of demersal fishes are more depth - related ( higher values in shallow water ) than latitude - related [ 29 ] .
red snapper eye - lens delta 13c remained below - 15.5 / 1000 throughout life , which is consistent with the red snapper 's known preference for deeper water on the middle and outer portions of west florida shelf .
the three gag may have started life at different locations , but spent a lengthy period of time together before collection .
unlike the red snapper , the gag uses shallow inshore waters as nursery habitat [ 37 ] .
the elevated delta 13c in gag 2 ( fig. 2 ) is indicative of residence in shallow water .
however , because delta 13c for demersal fish in inshore waters varies along the coastline as a statistical function of water clarity / depth ( photosynthetically active radiation at bottom ) , particulate organic carbon concentration , and sea - surface temperature [ 36 ] , not all gag can be expected to reside in high - delta 13c locations while in shallow nursery habitats .
all of the preceding geographic interpretations are subject to future corrections that accommodate shifts in trophic level and associated changes in total trophic fractionation .
the increase in delta 15n that was observed in most ( 94 %) specimens is consistent with increasing trophic level .
the trend in the sole exception , red snapper 45 , would be explained if the fish moved south later in life [ 29 ] , [ 36 ] .
among the four species , the gag ( a large , piscivorous grouper ) had relatively high delta 15n values at capture ; this is consistent with expected differences in trophic position among species .
directions for future work include , but are not limited to , the following areas of study : 1 ) eye lens aging by synchronizing lamina radial position with otolith - based or known captive age ; relationships between fish eye - lens diameter and age , lens wet - weight and age , and lens dry - weight and age have already been established [ 38 ] - [ 41 ] , 2 ) validating diet relationships using compound specific stable isotope analysis of the both the trophic and source amino acids within different laminae [ 42 ] - [ 44 ] , 3 ) determination of long - term geographic histories for individual fish by combining isotope histories , knowledge of how trophic level changes with age ( trophic growth rate ) , and output from isoscape models [ 36 ] ; modeled isoscape outputs must be synchronized with time periods within eye lenses for accuracy because spatial stationarity cannot be assumed [ 36 ] , [ 45 ] , 4 ) comparing isotopic fractionation of eye lens tissues with fractionation of other tissues [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] .
studying captive fish may be particularly definitive both for aging eye lenses and for validating diet relationships with eye - lens isotopes .
however , the production and accurate interpretation of long - term geographic histories for individual fish require that eye - lens aging and trophic growth rate studies be completed first .
while our ability to rigorously interpret geographic histories from the eye - lens isotope data is limited by the present lack of the aforementioned studies , the patterns of variation within the eye lenses ( figs. 1 - 4 ) indicate that the overall approach is promising .
there is no other known source of simultaneous delta 13c and delta 15n temporal records within bony fish .
the approach presented here is not necessarily limited to bony fish , and may also be applied to other vertebrates as long as the spatiotemporal distribution of apoptosis within the lens is taken into consideration .
in fish , tunel assays ( terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick - end labeling ) indicate that even recently formed laminae can be apoptotic and thus isotopically conservative [ 24 ] , whereas humans and other higher vertebrates may contain large proportions of pre - apoptotic ( potentially non - conservative ) cells in the outer cortical region of the lens. dr. theodore switzer ( fwc ) assisted us in efforts to obtain specimens from fwc fish surveys .

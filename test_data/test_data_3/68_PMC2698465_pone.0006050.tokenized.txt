we used mandrills ( mandrillus sphinx ) naturally infected with simian t - cell leukemia virus type 1 ( stlv - 1 ) as a model for evaluating the influence of natural stlv - 1 infection on the dynamics and evolution of the immune system during chronic infection .
furthermore , in order to evaluate the role of the immune system in controlling the infection during latency , we induced immunosuppression in the infected monkeys .
we first showed that the stlv - 1 proviral load was higher in males than in females and increased significantly with the duration of infection : mandrills infected for 10 - 6 years had a significantly higher proviral load than those infected for 2 - 4 years .
curiously , this observation was associated with a clear reduction in cd4 + t - cell number with age .
we also found that the percentage of cd4 + t cells co - expressing the activation marker hla - dr and the mean percentage of cd25 + in cd4 + and cd8 + t cells were significantly higher in infected than in uninfected animals .
furthermore , the stlv - 1 proviral load correlated positively with t - cell activation but not with the frequency of t cells secreting interferon gamma in response to tax peptides .
lastly , we showed that , during immunosuppression in infected monkeys , the percentages of cd8 + t cells expressing hla - dr + and of cd4 + t cells expressing the proliferation marker ki67 decreased significantly , although the percentage of cd8 + t cells expressing hla - dr + and ki67 increased significantly by the end of treatment .
interestingly , the proviral load increased significantly after immunosuppression in the monkey with the highest load .
our study demonstrates that mandrills naturally infected with stlv - 1 could be a suitable model for studying the relations between host and virus .
further studies are needed to determine whether the different compartments of the immune response during infection induce the long latency by controlling viral replication over time .
such studies would provide important information for the development of immune - based therapeutic strategies .
introduction human t - cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( htlv - 1 ) , the causative agent of adult t - cell leukemia / lymphoma ( atll ) [ 1 ] and of tropical spastic paraparesis / htlv - 1 - associated myelopathy ( tsp / ham ) [ 2 ] , has also been implicated in pediatric infectious dermatitis [ 3 ] , uveitis [ 4 ] , arthropathy [ 5 ] and polymyositis [ 6 ] .
simian t cell leukemia virus ( stlv - 1 ) , the simian counterpart of htlv - 1 , naturally infects old world monkeys and shares virologic , immunologic , molecular , and pathologic features with htlv - 1 [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
the phylogenic relations of most known subtypes indicate that stlv - 1 is the simian ancestor of htlv - 1 , the latter arising by transmission from multiple nonhuman primates to humans [ 10 ] - [ 14 ] .
in naturally infected monkeys , stlv - 1 causes diseases similar to those induced by htlv - 1 in humans , atll - like pathological features occurring in a minority of individuals after a long latency [ 15 ] - [ 18 ] .
in africa , stlv - 1 infection has been detected in both species of great ape ( pan and gorilla ) as well as in the old world monkey family cercopithecidae [ 9 ] .
the mandrill ( mandrillus sphinx ) , with a geographic distribution restricted to the tropical forests of cameroon , equatorial guinea , gabon , and southern congo [ 11 ] , [ 19 ] , is subject to infection with an stlv - 1 subtype closely related to htlv - 1 .
the first cases of natural stlv infection in mandrills ( stlvmnd ) were detected during a retrospective serological survey at the primate centre of the international centre for medical research ( cirmf ) in gabon .
two males were stlv - 1 - seropositive on their arrival at cirmf , strongly supporting the existence of stlv infection in the wild .
natural transmission of the virus has been monitored since the breeding colony was created in 1983 [ 20 ] .
the first genetic studies of stlvmnd indicated the presence of two genetically distinct strains [ 19 ] , intracolony transmission occurring mainly through male - male aggression [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
it has also been reported that stlv from mandrills is closely related to htlv - 1 .
the possibility of cross - species transmission of stlv - 1 to humans is supported by the fact that the stlvmnd viruses so far characterized are genetically similar to htlv - 1 subtype d and f viruses isolated from people living in central africa [ 11 ] , [ 19 ] .
moreover , african htlv - 1 and stlv - 1 cannot be separated into distinct phylogenetic lineages on the basis of their species of origin , but rather on the geographic origin of their hosts .
all this suggests that stlv infection of mandrills could serve as a model of human htlv infection .
although the phylogenetics of stlv - 1 infection of mandrills are well documented , few data are available on the virologic or molecular determinants of natural stlv - 1 infection in this host species .
moreover , little is known about the initial and latent phases of stlv - 1 / htlv - 1 infection in terms of proviral load , reservoir cells , viral expression , the pattern of viral integration ( clonality ) , the initial target cells , and the role of cytotoxic t - cell responses during natural infection in nonhuman primates .
we therefore examined immunological and virological patterns in a large group of naturally stlv - 1 - infected mandrills , including t - cell subsets , proviral load , and stlv - specific t - cell responses .
furthermore , to evaluate the role of the immune system in controlling stlv - 1 infection , we induced immunosuppression in naturally infected mandrills and evaluated the dynamics of immunologic and virologic parameters during and after treatment .
results high stlv - 1 prevalence and high proviral load in naturally infected mandrills sera from 142 mandrills ( 58 males , 84 females ; mean age , 10.7 years ) were tested by elisa for the presence of anti - stlv - 1 antibodies .
positive samples were confirmed by western blotting .
as shown in table 1 , 19 mandrills ( 13.4 %) , all with complete western blot profiles , had antibodies against htlv - 1 .
the prevalence of stlv - 1 infection increased significantly with age ( p = 0.001 ) , from 0 % at 1 - 4 years to 12.9 % at 5 - 10 years , 18.1 % at 11 - 15 years , and 33.3 % at > 16 years .
more males than females were infected ( 17.2 % vs 10.7 %) .
no mandrills under 4 years of age were infected .
the prevalence remained stable with age in females but increased with age in males , reaching 87.5 % at > 16 years .

on average , 4.56 % of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) were infected ( range , 0.54 - 12.7 %) ; however , the mean proviral load was higher in males ( 5.11 %) than in females ( 3.81 %) ( figure 1a ) and increased with age ( figure 1b ) .
furthermore , the proviral load increased significantly with the duration of infection ( figure 1c ) : mandrills infected for 8 - 15 years had significantly higher proviral loads than those infected for 2 - 4 years ( mean , 8.4 +/ - 4.8 versus 3.2 +/ - 2.9 ) .

evaluation of t - cell subsets and influence of stlv - 1 infection on t - cell response in order to evaluate the role of stlv - 1 infection in the evolution of the cellular immune response , the distribution of t - cell subsets defined by the markers cd4 , cd8 , hla - dr , and cd25 were compared in 17 stlv - 1 - infected ( two infected mandrills died of old age ) and 59 uninfected animals .
as shown in figure 2a and 2d , the percentages of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells were similar .
in contrast , the percentage of cd4 + t cells co - expressing the activation marker hla - dr was significantly higher in infected than in uninfected animals ( p = 0.001 ) ( figure 2b ) , even though no change was noted in the percentage of hla - dr markers in cd8 + t cells ( figure 2e ) .
furthermore , the mean percentages of cd25 + in cd4 + and cd8 + t cells ( 24.0 % and 11.7 % , respectively ) were higher in infected than in uninfected animals ( 20.8 % and 9.6 % , respectively ) ; this difference was not statistically significant ( figure 2c and 2f ) .

statistical analyses for each t - cell subset in the two groups of mandrills were performed with the mann - witney test .
the only significant difference was in the percentage of hladr in cd4 + t cells ( p = 0.001 ) .
the percentages of t - cell subsets were then correlated with the proviral load .
as seen in figure 3 , the percentage of cd4 + t cells correlated negatively with the stlv - 1 proviral load , while the percentage of cd8 + t cells showed a positive correlation ( figure 3a and 3d ) .
a positive correlation was also found between the proviral load and the percentages of hla - dr + in cd4 + t cells and cd25 + in cd4 + t cells and cd8 + t cells ( figure 3b , c , and f ) .
no correlation was found between the stlv - 1 proviral load and the percentage of cd8 + cells expressing the activation marker hla - dr + ( figure 3e ) .

stlv - 1 - specific cellular immune responses in chronically infected mandrills the frequency of t cells secreting interferon ( ifn ) - gamma in response to 82 overlapping peptides covering the totality of the tax gene ( table 2 ) was evaluated by elispot in the six chronically stlv - 1 - infected mandrills and in one uninfected monkey .
as shown in figure 4 , t cells from all six mandrills secreted ifn - gamma in the presence of at least one pool of peptides .
all the peptide pools were able to induce ifn - gamma secretion in the stlv - 1 - infected monkeys but not in the uninfected control , and none was found to be more immunogenic than the others .
no correlation was found between stlv proviral load and the frequency of stlv - specific cellular immune responses ( data not shown ) .
it is noteworthy , however , that the strongest cellular immune response was found in an animal (# mnd 5 ) with a low proviral load ( 1.3 %) .
therefore , to evaluate the role of the cellular immune response in controlling stlv - 1 , we investigated the effect of immunosuppressive treatment on the dynamics of the stlv proviral load and on the distribution of t - cell subsets .

effect of immunosuppressive treatment in mandrills chronically infected with stlv - 1 two groups of three mandrills were selected on the basis of their proviral burden , with low , medium and high burdens in each group .
the first group was immunosuppressed with tacrolimus , whereas the second group received phosphate - buffered saline as a control .
both the proviral load and the cd4 , cd8 , hla - dr , and ki67 t cell populations were evaluated before ( week - 2 , week - 1 , and day 0 ) , during ( weeks + 1 , + 2 , and + 3 ) and after treatment ( weeks + 4 , + 5 , + 6 , + 7 , and + 8 ) .
no effect on the biochemical markers usually seen during immunosuppression in humans was found ( data not shown ) .
one week after immunosuppression , tacrolimus was detected in the blood of treated monkeys within the therapeutic range used in humans ( figure 5a ) .

as seen in figure 5b and 5c , there was no significant variation in the proviral load in control or treated mandrills with low or medium proviral loads , but the proviral load increased significantly in the mandrill with the highest proviral load ( mnd 3 ) after tacrolimus administration ( figure 5b ) .
the mean numbers of t - cell subsets were measured in all animals in each group before , during , and after tacrolimus treatment .
tacrolimus did not affect the percentages of cd4 + or cd8 + t cells ( figure 6a and 6b ) or the disruption of naive and memory t cells ( data not shown ) .
in contrast , the percentage cd8 + expression of hla - dr + decreased significantly during therapy ( p = 0.01 ) ( figure 6d ) , whereas the percentage of cd4 + t cells expressing the proliferation marker ki67 decreased significantly during treatment ( p = 0.01 ) but increased significantly after the end of treatment ( p < 0.001 ) , as did the percentage of cd8 + t cells expressing ki67 ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 6e and 6f ) .
the control groups showed no statistically significant change in the percentages of cd4 + and cd8 + cells expressing hla - dr during or after treatment ( figure 6c and 6d ) .

discussion our study provides the first in - depth virological and immunological characterization of natural stlv - 1 infection in a nonhuman primate .
we further evaluated the influence of this natural infection on the dynamics and evolution of the immune system during chronic infection and after the induction of immunosuppression in the infected monkeys .
when the mandrill colony was created in 1983 , only two founder males were infected with stlv - 1 .
phylogenetic studies have since shown that they were infected with subtypes d and f [ 19 ] .
a retrospective study of the same colony showed that in 1995 eight males were stlv - 1 - seropositive .
the suspected mode of transmission was through bites inflicted during fights for dominance [ 21 ] .
no females were infected at that time .
the data reported here show that the prevalence is now high in males and increases markedly with age .
we also show that females are now infected , but at a lower prevalence than in males , even among the oldest females .
transmission during fights cannot be ruled out , but sexual transmission , as in humans , should be considered .
no cases of infection were detected among juveniles (< 4 years ) , ruling out transmission in utero or during breastfeeding .
thus , the modes of stlv - 1 transmission appear to be slightly different from those in humans , where the major mode of transmission is sexual or from mother to child during breastfeeding .
it was reported previously that the rate of htlv - 1 transmission in humans , particularly from infected mothers to infants , increases significantly when women have a high htlv - 1 proviral load [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
thus , even if the route of stlv - 1 transmission in mandrills is different , the high proviral load in dominant male mandrills might explain the high rate of stlv - 1 transmission in the colony .
a recent study in a baboon colony showed that females were more frequently infected than males [ 24 ] .
these results illustrate that different patterns of behavior of different nonhuman primates result in different profiles of virus circulation .
we also showed a wide range of stlv - 1 proviral loads in pbmcs of infected monkeys .
in some mandrills , the proviral load was very high ( up to 12.7 % of pbmcs ) , reaching levels usually associated with the onset of clinical manifestations in htlv - 1 - infected humans , whereas the mandrills naturally infected with stlv - 1 appeared healthy .
few reports have been made of the stlv proviral load in naturally infected monkeys [ 25 ] .
those authors reported a high stlv - 1 proviral load in naturally infected celebes macaques ( macaca tonkeana ) without inflammatory disease .
nevertheless , htlv - 1 - associated disease is rare in humans , with less than 5 % infections after a long incubation period [ 26 ] .
in order to demonstrate that stlv - 1 can also induce inflammatory disease in its natural host , however , a long - term clinical survey of infected monkeys will be necessary .
our study shows that proviral load is correlated positively with the duration of infection and thus with the age of the animals .
no follow - up study of stlv - 1 - infected monkeys has previously been reported .
in some studies in humans , however , there was no clear evidence of an association between proviral load and duration of infection [ 27 ] .
it has been shown that the htlv - 1 proviral load is a strong predictor of disease progression , and patients with tsp / ham or adult t - cell leukemia have a higher proviral load than asymptomatic htlv - 1 carriers [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
furthermore , people infected with htlv - 1 develop associated diseases such as atll after long latency periods ( 30 - 40 years ) .
it has been suggested previously that the development of associated disease in older individuals could be related to an immunosenescence phenomenon that leads to expansion and activation of htlv - 1 - infected cells [ 30 ] .
in order to clarify the relation between the increased level of stlv - 1 in older monkeys and the role of the immune response during life , we evaluated the numbers of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in stlv - 1 - infected and uninfected monkeys of different ages and observed clear reductions in the absolute numbers of both cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in older than in younger monkeys ( figure s1 ) .
thus , the equilibrium between viral replication and the destruction and activation of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells might define the course of stlv - 1 infection during the long latency .
the loss of cd4 + t cells could induce a state of immunodeficiency in older individuals .
these findings are in accordance with the observation that disequilibrium of the immune system with age can lead to uncontrolled virus expansion and thus to a high proviral load , which could lead further to disease progression .
each stlv - 1 - infected monkey will have to be followed - up to evaluate the dynamics of the stlv - 1 proviral load and its correlation with various modifications in the immune response that could lead to disease progression after the long latency .
these studies are under way .
in the present study , we found that the percentage of cd4 + t cells co - expressing the activation marker hla - dr + was higher in stlv - 1 - infected monkeys than in uninfected control animals .
furthermore , there was a significant correlation between activated cd4 + cd25 + cells , cd8 + cd25 + cells and proviral load , and primates with high proviral loads had elevated numbers of these cells .
in humans , htlv - 1 leukemic cells have an activated helper / inducer t - cell phenotype , cd4 + cd25 + , which could be activated by the htlv - 1 tax oncogene [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
we showed recently that both cd4 + and cd8 + t cells are infected in stlv - 1 infected mandrills [ 34 ] .
furthermore , a spontaneous t - cell leukaemia / lymphoma has been described in some african monkeys naturally infected with stlv - 1 [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 35 ] - [ 38 ] , in which both cd4 + [ 15 ] , [ 18 ] and cd8 + [ 37 ] , [ 39 ] cells are involved .
the results presented in this paper thus reinforce the observation that these cells might be involved in the development of associated diseases .
regulatory t ( treg ) cells express cd4 + and cd25 + and have potent immune response suppressive activity [ 40 ] ; however , their exact role in htlv - 1 infection is unknown .
in recent studies , leukaemia cells from patients with atll strongly expressed foxp3 [ 32 ] , a specific marker for treg cells .
these cells constitute about 2 - 3 % of human cd4 + t cells [ 40 ] , and they have increasingly been found to play conflicting roles in both autoimmune and infectious disease .
yamano et al .
[ 41 ] showed that htlv - 1 tax induced dysfunction of cd4 + cd25 + t cells in patients with htlv - i - associated neuroimmunological disease .
more recently , toulza et al .
[ 42 ] proposed that cd4 + cd25high foxp3 + cells are the chief determinants of the efficiency of t - cell - mediated immune control of htlv - 1 .
in our study , however , we observed no pathologic or clinical manifestations of inflammatory status .
thus , further physiopathologic characterization is required to define the association between natural stlv - 1 infection and associated disease in this animal model .
in humans , only 2 - 8 % of htlv - 1 - infected persons develop a severe htlv - 1 - associated disease like atlll or tsp / ham during their lifetime , generally after a long latency [ 26 ] .
furthermore , in monkeys , associated diseases such as atll have been related , in some cases , to co - infection with siv [ 17 ] , [ 43 ] .
mandrills are also naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus ( sivmnd ) [ 44 ] .
as only monkeys infected with stlv - 1 were selected for the present study , co - infection with siv in our mandrill colony might account for the development of associated diseases .
thus , long - term clinical studies in non - human primates are required to evaluate the relation between stlv - 1 infection and the development of associated diseases .
in order to elucidate the role of the immune system in controlling stlv infection , we evaluated the frequency of circulating effector t cells against tax in chronically stlv - 1 - infected monkeys .
although the response to the various peptides was different in each monkey , a response was detected in all .
in our studies with chronically infected squirrel monkeys , we showed the presence of a cytolytic t - cell response against tax in enriched cd8 + t cells [ 45 ] .
the present study reports for the first time a cellular immune response against tax , although we could not identify the cells involved , and further studies are needed .
to determine whether the cellular immune response during chronic stlv - 1 infection in natural hosts controls stlv - 1 replication over time , resulting in the long latency , immunosuppression studies with tacrolimus ( fk506 ) were conducted .
it has been reported previously that some graft recipients treated with immunosuppressive drugs develop atll [ 46 ] - [ 48 ] .
in a study of patients treated with various immunosuppressive drugs , those given tacrolimus had a higher risk for atl than those treated with cyclosporin [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
in our study , we observed no clinical manifestation related to stlv - 1 infection after immunosuppression , although some significant modifications were observed in the activation markers and the proliferation status of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in tacrolimus - treated monkeys .
most importantly , in the animal with the highest proviral load , an increased stlv - 1 proviral load was observed after the immunosuppression period .
in the same animal , the increase in proviral load correlated with increased numbers of activation and proliferation markers of cd4 + t cells and specifically with increased numbers of the activation marker hladr + in cd8 + t cells .
this observation confirms the implication of t - cell expansion in viral replication and in the expansion of infected cells after immunosuppression .
one limitation of this part of our study is the small number of animals in the two groups undergoing immunosuppression .
more significant effects might be found in larger numbers of animals with higher proviral loads and more aggressive immunosuppression , which could lead to the development of htlv - 1 - associated diseases such as atll .
we are now focusing our efforts in this direction .
for example , it has been reported that treatment with cyclophosphamide negatively affects the number of treg cells but totally conserves the other th1 repertory cells [ 51 ] .
thus , to evaluate the role of treg cells in htlv - 1 pathogenesis , we shall investigate the effect of cyclophosphamide in stlv - 1 infected monkeys .
in summary , we have demonstrated that naturally stlv - 1 - infected mandrills could be a suitable model for studying the relation between host and virus .
further studies are needed to determine whether the different compartments of the immune response during infection are responsible for the long latency , by controlling viral replication over time .
such studies would provide important information for the development of immune - based therapeutic strategies .
materials and methods animals we studied 142 semi - free - ranging mandrills housed in the primatology centre of the cirmf , gabon .
mandrills were handled in accordance with standard operating procedures in the cirmf as well as in accordance with the united states national institutes of health ( nih ) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals .
all the animal protocols and procedures were approved by the ethical committee of ile de france for animal experimentation and by the gabonese ethics committee for animal experimentation , and registered under no .
08 - 006 .
the primate centre has three veterinarians specialized in primates - - an ethologist , a primatologist , and an ecologist - - and all experiments were conducted under their supervision. between november 2006 and january 2007 , blood samples were collected from mandrills in edta - k2 tubes under ketamine - hcl ( 10 mg / kg body weight ) anesthesia .
for other immunovirological and immunosuppression studies ( see below ) , six stlv - 1 - infected mandrills were selected from the free - ranging colony on the basis of their stlv - 1 proviral load , two monkeys having a high load , two medium and two low .
they were also selected on the basis of their ability to live together in an isolated enclosure without aggressive behavior and without disruption of the free - ranging breeding colony during the experimentation period .
serological screening it has been reported previously that stlv - 1 from mandrills is highly homologous to human htlv - 1 subtype b ( see introduction ) .
thus , we used the criteria for diagnosis of htlv - 1 infection in humans to evaluate the presence of stlv - 1 in our mandrill colony [ 11 ] , [ 19 ] .
plasma was screened for antibodies to htlv - i / ii / stlv - 1 with two enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisas ) , namely htlv - i platelia new ( biorad , marnes - la - coquette , france ) and vironostica ( biomerieux , marcy l'etoile , france ) .
stlv - 1 infection was confirmed by western blotting ( htlv blot 2.4 , diagnostic biotechnology ltd , singapore ) .
mandrills were considered stlv - 1 positive when a complete western blot profile was obtained .
immunosuppression immunosuppression was induced in mandrills by administering tacrolimus ( prograf ( r ) , 5 mg / ml , astellas ireland , cokerry , ireland ) via an intraperitoneally implanted osmotic pump ( alzet ( r ) model 2ml4 , charles river laboratories , l'arbresle , france ) at a dose of 0.1 mg / kg body weight per day for 28 days .
three mandrills received tacrolimus , and the other three received phosphate - buffered saline , ph 7.2 ( biomerieux , marcy l'etoile , france ) .
blood samples were collected at weeks - 3 , - 2 , - 1 , 0 , + 1 , + 2 , + 3 , + 4 , + 5 , + 6 , + 7 , and + 8 .
before immunosuppression of the infected monkeys , the baseline numbers of t - cell subsets ( see below ) were evaluated for each animal ( table s1 ) .
the monkeys were healthy , and there was no significant difference in the t - cell subsets of these stlv - 1 - infected monkeys and those of 59 uninfected animals ( table s1 ) .
pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus tacrolimus concentrations were determined with pro - trac ii tacrolimus elisa kits , as recommended by the manufacturer ( diasorin , stillwater , minnesota , usa ) , in whole blood , before treatment and weekly for 6 weeks during treatment .
tacrolimus concentrations were determined by interpolation from a standard curve .
flow cytometric analysis of cell - surface and intracellular marker expression whole - blood samples were analyzed by four - color flow cytometry with a standard procedure and a panel of monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) .
the mabs were originally designed to detect human molecules but cross - react with the mandrill counterparts .
the mabs were against cd4 - fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) ( clone mt4 - 77 ) , cd4 - phycoerythrin ( pe ) ( clone l200 ) , cd3 - allophycocyanin ( clone sp34 - 2 ) , cd8 - peridine chlorophyll protein ( clone sk1 ) , hla dr - pe ( clone g46 - 6 ) , cd25 - pe ( clone 2a3 ) , ki67 - fitc ( clone b56 ) , cd28 - pe ( clone l293 ) , and cd95 - fitc ( clone dx2 ) , all obtained from bd bioscience ( le pont de claix , france ) .
at least 10 000 events were acquired in the lymphocyte square on a facscalibur flow cytometer driven by the cellquest software package ( becton dickinson , heidelberg , germany ) .
data were analyzed with flowjo software v7.2 ( tree star , inc. , ashland , oregon , usa ) .
stlv proviral load pbmcs were separated by ficoll density gradient centrifugation .
pbmc dna was extracted by the phenol / chloroform procedure .
stlv proviral load was quantified by using a real - time sybr green pcr method with iq sybr green supermix ( biorad , marnes - la - coquette , france ) on an icycler thermal cycler coupled with the iq5 optical system ( biorad , marnes - la - coquette , france ) .
the primer sets sk43 ( cggatacccagtctacgtgt ) and sk44 ( gagccgataacgcgtccatcg ) , at a final concentration of 1.5 micromol / l , were used to amplify a 159 - base - pair fragment of the tax gene ( location , sk43:2 - 22 ; sk44:141 - 161 ) .
the reaction proceeded as follows : 5 min at 95degreesc , 50 cycles of 10 s at 95degreesc , 5 s at 60degreesc , and 10 s at 72degreesc .
melting - curve analysis was performed in 0.5degreesc increments from 60degreesc to 95degreesc .
a standard curve was generated with 10 - fold serial dilutions of mt4 cells , each of which is known to contain seven copies of proviral htlv .
to standardize the cell number , the albumin gene was also quantified by taqman pcr with itaq supermix and rox ( biorad , marnes - la - coquette , france ) .
the taqman probe albt ( 5'fam - cctgtcatgcccacacaaatctctcc - tamra3 ') and the primers albf ( gctgtcatctcttgtgggctgt ) and albr ( actcatgggagctgctggttc ) were used as described elsewhere ( gabet et al. , 2003 ) .
the pcr protocol consisted of 3 min at 95degreesc , 50 cycles for 10 s at 95degreesc , and 45 s at 60degreesc .
the stlv proviral load is reported as the copy number per 100 cells .
enzyme - linked immunospot ( elispot ) assay for ifn - gamma we used 82 overlapping peptides covering the entire tax protein [ 52 ] , which were divided into 17 pools , each containing five overlapping peptides of 12 amino acids ( table 2 ) .
the peptides were modified according to the tax sequences obtained from an stlv - 1 infected mandrill ( genbank accession no. fj755931 ) .
the peptides were diluted to 1 mg / ml in distilled water .
the elispot assay was carried out as previously described [ 53 ] .
briefly , multiscreen filtration plates ( maips4510 , millipore , bedford , massachusetts , usa ) were coated with 15 microg / ml of an mab against ifn - gamma ( 1 - d1k , mabtech , sweden ) overnight at 4degreesc .
the plates were then washed five times with rpmi - 1640 medium and blocked with rpmi 1640 supplemented with l - glu , pen / strep , and 10 % fetal calf serum for 2 h. then , 2x105 pbmc in the above medium were added in a total volume of 200 microl , in the presence or absence of 10 microg / ml of relevant peptide , and incubated for 40 h at 37degreesc .
the cells were then incubated with 100 microl of 1 microg / ml biotinylated mab 7 - b6 - 1 against ifngamma ( mabtech , sweden ) for 3 h at room temperature .
after washing , the substrate bcip / nbt ( kirkegaard and perry labs , gaithersburg , maryland , usa ) was added , and the solution was incubated in the dark for 10 - 20 min until the appearance of dark - blue spots .
the reaction was stopped by washing with cold tap - water , and the spots were counted with an immunospot image analyzer ( zeiss , oberkochen , germany ) .
the frequency of responding cells , obtained after subtracting background spots in negative control wells ( medium alone ) , was expressed as spot - forming cells per million pbmc .
statistical analysis the mann - whitney u test was used to compare groups .
correlations were sought by using the standard pearson correlation coefficient or spearman 's rank correlation test .
significance was assumed at p < 0.05 .
all analyses were performed with statistica software v7.1 .

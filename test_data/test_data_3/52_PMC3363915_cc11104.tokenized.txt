methods a prospective study of 72 patients and 99 family members that completed the hospital anxiety and depression scale during the icu stay and at 30 and 90 days after discharge .
the impact of event scale at 30 and 90 days after icu discharge was used to evaluate post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) .
results the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety , depression or both in patients during the icu stay was 10 % , 2.8 % and 6.9 % respectively .
among family members prevalence was 17.3 % , 6.5 % and 14.4 % respectively , and was significantly higher compared to patients ( p = 0.034 ) .
ptsd symptoms were present in 39.8 % and 32.7 % of family members respectively at 30 and 90 days after discharge .
among patients symptoms were significantly lower ( p < 0.001 ) .
factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during the icu stay in a multivariate model included patient - related factors as saps 3 ( or 1.1 , 95 % ci 1.01 to 1.24 ) and length of family member stay in the icu ( or 1.39 , 95 % ci 0.89 to 2.16 ) and family - related factors as female gender ( or 5.43 , 95 % ci 0.67 to 43.8 ) and oncologic diagnosis ( or 0.25 , 95 % ci 0.05 to 1.31 ) .
the multivariate model also identified patient age ( or 0.97 , 95 % ci 0.93 to 1 ) and oncologic diagnosis ( or 0.27 , 95 % ci 0.09 to 0.79 ) associated with symptoms of post - traumatic stress after discharge among family members .
conclusion at least one - third of family members visiting patients in the icu suffer from symptoms of anxiety , depression or both .
the level of post - traumatic stress symptoms in family members was high after icu discharge .
depression , anxiety and post - traumatic stress symptoms were higher among family members compared to patients .
female gender and oncologic diagnosis were strongly associated with depression and post - traumatic stress .
further actions might be adopted to diminish the incidence of these disorders .

these molecular characterizations have led to the proposal of prognostic biomarkers for many cancer types .
nevertheless , most of these biomarkers have been proposed for a specific cancer type or even specific subtypes .
although more challenging , it is useful to identify biomarkers that can be applied for multiple types of cancer .
here , we have used a network - based exploration approach to identify a multi - cancer gene expression biomarker highly connected by esr1 , prkaca , lrp1 , jun and smad2 that can be predictive of clinical outcome in 12 types of cancer from the cancer genome atlas ( tcga ) repository .
the gene signature of this biomarker is highly supported by cancer literature , biological terms , and prognostic power in other cancer types .
additionally , the signature does not seem to be highly associated with specific mutations or copy number alterations .
comparisons with cancer - type specific and other multi - cancer biomarkers in tcga and other datasets showed that the performance of the proposed multi - cancer biomarker is superior , making the proposed approach and multi - cancer biomarker potentially useful in research and clinical settings .
cancer is typically classified by tissue - specific scores such as the gleason score in prostate cancer1 , the dukes or astler - coller in colon cancer2 , or figo in cervical cancer3 .
these have been generalized by tnm staging4 .
more recently , high - throughput technologies have generated unprecedented molecular characterizations of cancer types , such as the genomic portrayals provided by the cancer genome atlas ( tcga ) research network567 .
several cancer types have been divided into subtypes using tcga data about gene expression8 , mutations9 , copy number alterations10 , microrna expression11 , pseudogenes12 , or even biological processes such as inflammation13 .
nevertheless , specific subtypes across cancer types seem to share common gene expression properties such as correlations1415 , stromal and immune signatures16 , or mesenchymal signatures17 .
clinically , better or alternative methods to identify cancer risk groups are always needed .
although point mutations and chromosomal alterations are currently the subject of active research , a large reservoir of public research has been devoted to the study of gene expression1819 , which is the most broadly studied class of molecular data for cancer so far .
more importantly , gene expression is a consequence of cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations. with the goal of clinically stratifying samples into risk groups , several gene expression biomarkers have been proposed for a large variety of cancer types202122232425 .
however , most biomarkers have been identified and designed for a specific type of cancer .
moreover , some biomarkers can be applied only to specific subtypes ; for example , biomarkers exist specifically for grade 2 in colon cancer26 and estrogen receptor - positive and lymph node - negative in breast cancer27 .
many proposed gene signatures may not even be considered for clinical use because they could not be reliably validated in other cohorts28 .
in some cases , a lack of agreement has also been reported among gene expression signatures obtained for the same type of cancer29 .
in addition , it was recently shown that biomarkers identified for only one cancer type perform modestly or poorly even when clinical data are considered30 .
gene expression biomarkers that can be applied for a broad range of cancers could be highly useful in research and clinical settings .
in clinics , such biomarkers may serve as a standard assessment for facilitating the interpretation and broad application of laboratory test results , simplifying laboratory protocols , and reducing costs .
in research , these biomarkers may help to elucidate broadly observed biological mechanisms and possible drug targets .
nevertheless , gene expression biomarkers that can be applied to more than one cancer type are scarce .
most studies exploit specific properties to identify multi - cancer signatures .
for example , signatures have been identified from metastasis - specific solid tumors31 , or found to be associated with chromosomal instability32 , therapy - failures33 , proliferation signatures34 , subsequent cancers35 , and embryonic stem - cell like gene expression36 .
distinct algorithms and strategies have been used to identify biomarkers for more than 10 years .
these methods include variable selection by shrinkage3738 , penalization3940 , clustering41 , differential expression4243 , or simply by selection of the top - ranked genes using a univariate cox score21 , among many others44 .
most of these methods nevertheless do not consider a priori biological information to identify gene signatures .
the use of biological information adds a layer of validation and prioritization45 that can be exploited for biomarker discovery .
common approaches that consider biological information use networks such as protein - protein interactions ( ppi ) or gene ontologies , which drives the search for modules or terms that could function as gene signatures .
for example , a set of significant subnetwork biomarkers to classify breast cancer metastasis was identified by performing a greedy search starting from seed genes and then adding neighbor genes46 .
these subnetworks were then compared with a null distribution of random subnetworks .
similarly , this algorithm was adapted for a web server that provides network - based biomarkers for survival data47 .
a network module - based approach applied a markov clustering algorithm to the correlation of the ppi matrix identifying modules associated with patient survival48 .
an algorithm similar to that used by google for ranking web pages has been proposed to order genes according to their association with survival outcomes49 .
modularity has also been suggested as an indicator of breast cancer prognosis as determined by an algorithm to find intramodular highly co - expressed and highly interconnected " hub " genes and intermodular hub genes with low co - expression50 .
moreover , gene ontology has also been used to identify metastasis network modules combining highly predictive gene ontology sets51 .
to the best of our knowledge , these network - based approaches have not been tailored to produce network - based multi - cancer biomarkers .
here we describe a network - based approach that explores , in parallel , gene - to - gene connections in multiple cancer datasets while maximizing the overall association of the subnetwork with clinical outcomes .
we implemented this network - based algorithm using , as a proof of concept , the human protein reference database ( hprd ) 52 , 12 tcga cancer types53 , and a composite cox - based model54 .
in these training datasets , the results showed that a gene signature of 41 genes was capable of predicting risk groups across cancer types with high precision .
analysis of a large collection of clinical outcome cancer datasets that included cancers types reported by several authors and many cancer types that were not included in the training datasets validated these results .
the predictive power of the biomarker was higher than that of clinical information alone and improved when combined .
our results suggest that it is possible to identify general , compact , and biologically driven gene expression biomarkers for multiple cancer types .
material and methods datasets we used data from 12 cancer types that belong to the tcga pan - cancer project repository53 accessed in january 2013 , compiled in 11 datasets ( http :// nature.com / tcga ) .
detailed lists of datasets , genes and samples used are shown in table 1 and supplementary table 1 .
level 3 data were used .
only gene symbols present in all cancer types were used .
microarray data ( agilent and affymetrix ) were transformed using quantile normalization .
rna - seq data were log2 transformed and quantile normalized .
biological networks we used the protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) network from the human protein reference database ( hprd ) 52 accessed in march 2013 .
the network covered 9,465 genes and 37,080 interactions .
only genes found in both the tcga datasets and the network were used .
performance of network modules we used gene expression values from each cancer type fitting a cox model to measure the level of association of a given gene signature .
for biomarkers specific to a cancer - type , the negative logarithm of the log - rank test ( nllrt ) was used to assess and drive the network - based search .
for the multi - cancer biomarker , we used the nllrt of a reference cancer - type minus the range of the nllrt from the remaining cancer - types .
subtracting the range of values gave preference to less variable signatures , helping to avoid over - fitting to specific cancer types .
we used gbm as the reference cancer - type because its performance was the lowest across the cancer type - specific runs .
nevertheless , we also used other cancer types as reference and compared the results .
to assess the overall performance of the prediction after biomarker identification , we used the concordance index ( c - index ) measure , which is similar to the area under the receiving operating curve55 .
c - index values close to 0.5 are referred to as random risk predictions whereas c - index values close to 1 are interpreted as nearly perfect risk predictions .
to represent the performance of biomarkers graphically , we split the samples by the median of the prognostic index to designate low - and high - risk groups .
the prognostic index is the linear component of the exponential function in the cox model .
network clinical association ( nca ) algorithm figure 1 shows a graphical representation of the nca algorithm .
the algorithm proceeds in cycles , starting with the determination of the performance of an isolated gene ( a seed gene ) across all datasets .
then , a module growth cycle is performed , in which all connected genes are explored , one gene at a time , generating as many grown modules as connections .
in the exploration , the performance of the module is evaluated using the nllrt value described above .
afterwards , only the top 5 % of the modules whose nllrt value improved after the addition of new connections are considered for the next growth cycle .
the procedure continues until no improvement is observed .
the algorithm starts by using each gene as a seed .
this algorithm functions as a type of hill - climbing algorithm .
scripts or executables of this algorithm are available from the corresponding author .
validation analysis to determine the significance of the c - index values , we generated a null distribution composed of 10,000 random models of 41 genes for the tcga datasets we used .
to assess the c - index prediction of the biomarkers in datasets other than tcga , we used survexpress56 , which provides evaluations of gene lists across cancer types .
for this , we used normalized datasets that included overall survival times ( without considering recurrence , metastases , or relapse ) and only those studies containing more than 30 samples .
for replicated genes , we selected the highest expressed probe .
analyses were performed in r ( http :// cran.r - project.org /) .
for biological validation , we used msigdb and david5758 to determine which biological terms were associated with the biomarker gene lists .
we also compared the c - index values of our multi - cancer biomarker with those of other multi - cancer biomarkers reported in the literature .
for model comparisons including clinical features ( e. g. cancer staging ) , we used the " other factors " option in survexpress .
results identification of biomarkers for specific cancer types we first executed the nca algorithm ( fig. 1 ) for each of the 11 cancer datasets .
we focused on the network modules with the highest performance value .
the results shown in table 2 suggest that , in general , several network modules existed for each cancer type , from 84 for lusc to 10,303 for blca .
most cancer types generated modules with about 9 genes , ranging in size from 4 for kirc to 14 for lusc .
to generate a biomarker that is representative of all modules for a specific cancer type , we used the genes that most frequently occurred in modules ( around 41 genes for comparisons with the multi - cancer biomarker ) .
the list of genes obtained is provided in supplementary table 2 .
comparisons of the genes used for these biomarkers across cancer types showed that the pairwise gene overlap was low ( ranging from 0 to 5 , see fig. 2a ) .
although the specific genes used for each biomarker were clearly different , indicating that the biomarkers are cancer type - specific , the prediction across cancer types was surprisingly satisfactory ; the average c - index values were higher than 0.75 ( fig. 2b and supplementary table 3 ) .
almost all cancer type - specific biomarkers showed c - index values higher than 0.70 for about 8 cancer types ( fig. 2c ) .
we observed consistent c - index values within each cancer type almost irrespective of the network - based biomarker ( fig. 2d ) .
for instance , all biomarkers had a c - index value about 0.97 for blca and 0.95 for coadread but about 0.65 for ov and 0.62 for gbm .
nevertheless , a random signature analysis indicated that only 14 of the 121 c - index values ( 11.5 %) were significant , mainly those of cancer type - specific biomarkers within the same cancer type dataset ( excluding blca and coadread , see fig. 2a and supplementary table 3 ) .
identification of a multi - cancer biomarker to generate a broadly predictive biomarker , we used the nca algorithm and considered the 11 datasets in the same run .
we estimated a composite performance score based on the individual performance of all cancer types .
we maximized the overall performance by taking the nllrt of a reference cancer type ( glioblastoma ) and subtracting the range of nllrt values of the other cancer types .
in this way , genes generating large deviances for specific cancer types were avoided in favor of the inclusion of genes that improved the prediction in many cancer types .
two very similar modules consisting of 44 genes were identified ( table 2 ) .
only 6 genes were not present in both modules ( jdp2 , kif5b , ntrk3 , mmp13 , tgfb1 , and tgfbrap1 ) .
therefore , we used the genes present in both modules as the overall multi - cancer biomarker .
the identified network biomarker was composed of 41 genes highly connected by esr1 , prkaca , lrp1 , jun and smad2 ( fig. 3a ) .
this gene signature was able to discriminate between low - and high - risk groups efficiently in the 11 cancer datasets ( fig. 3b and table 3 ) through the statistical association of specific genes ( fig. 3c ) .
the log - rank test and the cox model fitting were highly significant across cancer types ( table 3 ) .
the average c - index value across cancer types was 0.81 ranging from 0.65 to 1 .
eight of these 11 predictions were significant according to a randomization analysis ( fig. 2b and supplementary table 3 ) .
the highest c - index predictions were observed for blca and coadread , whereas the lowest c - index predictions were observed for gbm and ov. in a comparison of the predicted low - and high - risk groups ( splitting the prognostic index by the median ) , we observed several genes differentially expressed across cancer types , except in blca ( fig. 3c and table 3 ) .
apart from lmo4 and ddx5 , the other 39 genes were differentially expressed between risk groups in two or more cancer types .
lmo4 was not differentially expressed in any cancer but was significantly associated with gbm , luad , and lusc according to the cox model .
ddx5 was highly differentially expressed in luad and associated with three cancer types according to the cox model .
similarly , 36 genes were associated with the cox model for two cancer types or more .
surprisingly , esr1 was not associated with cox models but was differentially expressed in two cancer types and served as a hub for connecting 10 genes .
an overrepresentation analysis of the 41 genes using msigdb57 and david58 revealed important biological associations across pathways , transcriptional control , gene ontologies , and other biological terms ( fig. 3d ) .
some of these pathways are well known to be associated with cancer , such as the mapk59 , lkb160 , eralpha61 , and ngf62 pathways .
some genes were highly associated with transcription factors such as sp163 , gene ontologies such as signaling , and other biological terms such as immune system , copy number gains in cancer , and mir - 18 targets .
in addition , at least 36 of the 41 genes have been associated in the literature with one or more cancer types ( fig. 3d ) .
these findings support the utility of determining which genes predicted specific cancer types and suggest that the signature we generated is robust across cancer subtypes .
comparison of the multi - cancer and cancer type - specific biomarkers it has been proposed that molecular processes may be similar across cancer types141564 .
consequently , a biomarker of clinical outcomes in a specific cancer type may be a good biomarker in a different cancer type .
therefore , we compared our 12 biomarkers to identify similarities .
in terms of gene content ( supplementary table 2 ) , the multi - cancer ( multi - nca ) biomarker was not particularly similar to the cancer type - specific biomarkers ( fig. 2a ) .
indeed , the biomarker most similar to others was ov , which contained 17 genes ( 29 occurrences ) that overlapped with other biomarkers out of the 418 unique genes .
this similarity was considerably higher than that of the multi - nca , which had 9 genes ( 17 occurrences ) overlapping and that of the most specific biomarker , gbm , which had only 4 genes ( 5 occurrences ) in common with the other biomarkers .
a comparison of the average c - index values across biomarkers and cancer types showed that the multi - nca biomarker was , overall , the best ( average c - index = 0.81 ) but it was closely followed by ov and brca ( average c - index of 0.80 and 0.79 respectively ; fig. 2 ) .
the c - index of the multi - nca biomarker was almost always better than those of the cancer type - specific biomarkers ( fig. 2d ) .
nevertheless , in each cancer type , the c - index was higher using the cancer type - specific biomarker than using the multi - nca biomarker ( by 0.047 on average ) .
despite this , an analysis of 10,000 random biomarkers showed that 8 of 11 c - index predictions of the multi - nca biomarker were significant ( fig. 2b and supplementary table 3 ) whereas the c - indexes in most cancer type - specific biomarkers were significant only in one or two cancer types ( ov in three and marginally in two more ) .
in terms of prediction power per cancer type , the blca and coadread average c - index values were , by far , the highest ( both 0.98 ) .
in contrast , the c - indexes for gbm and ov were the lowest ( 0.62 and 0.65 respectively ) .
comparisons with clinical features although biomarkers can be a useful clinical tool to predict outcomes , some of the generated biomarkers may not actually be useful in clinical practice if the gene signature does not add predictive power beyond that of the usual clinical features30 .
to assess this , we determined the c - index of the multi - nca biomarker and the available clinical features per cancer type .
the supplementary figure 1 shows that the multi - nca biomarker adds between 0.04 and 0.30 of prediction power over clinical features alone .
in contrast , the clinical features add only between 0 and 0.075 over the biomarker alone .
overall , in most cancer types ( except kirc ) the biomarker makes better predictions than clinical features alone .
these results suggest that the multi - nca signature adds a considerable level of predictive power to clinical features .
we also determined whether the multi - nca signature was sensitive to stratifications using cancer features .
for this , we used the widely used cancer staging system for each cancer type to compare the performance of c - indexes across cancer stages .
as shown in supplementary figure 2 , c - index values varied somewhat across stages , perhaps influenced by the number of tcga samples available per stage. of note , in brca stage iiia , in kirc stage iii and iv , ov stage iiib , and ucec stage iiic , the c - indexes were lower than 0.05 relative to the overall c - indexes for corresponding cancer types ( in these cases the estimation considered more than 20 samples ) .
nevertheless , the c - index value is still acceptable for most stages .
this stratification provides an estimation of the response of markers across a wide spectrum of subtypes .
external comparison and validation of biomarkers for external validation of the multi - nca biomarker , we compared the c - index with other 5 multi - cancer biomarkers proposed by other authors326566 representing signatures of chromosome instability ( cin70 ) 32 , multiple cancer - related pathways ( poised gene cassette , pgc ) 65 , mesenchymal transition ( mes ) 66 , mitotic chromosomal instability ( cin ) 66 , and lymphocyte infiltration ( lym ) 66 .
the 41 genes in the multi - nca biomarker did not overlap with any of the genes in cin70 , pgc , mes , cin , and lym ( supplementary table 2 ) .
the average c - index for the lym biomarker was 0.796 , just below that of our multi - nca biomarker , which was 0.809 ( supplementary table 3 ) .
the c - index for lym was nevertheless significant in only 3 tcga datasets compared with 8 datasets for the multi - nca biomarker , suggesting that our multi - cancer biomarker is superior to the lym biomarker .
to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the biomarkers in cancer data other than tcga , we used survexpress56 to analyze the multi - nca and the cancer type - specific biomarkers we generated , and the multi - cancer biomarkers generated by other - authors .
we used 122 cancer datasets containing 19,105 samples spanning about 20 types of tissues ( supplementary table 4 ) .
these datasets covered cancer types not used to develop the nca - based biomarkers such as cancer of the bone , esophagus , eye , liver , prostate , pancreas , and skin , as well as medulloblastomas and astrocytomas , and others .
we performed two analyses , the first averaging all 122 datasets , and the second normalizing the average per tissue .
the second analysis was more important because some tissues have been more studied than others such as lung , ovary , breast , brain , and colon .
in addition , some cohorts are reported in various datasets .
the results showed that our multi - nca biomarker was one of the top biomarkers evaluated ; it was the most accurate in the per - tissue analysis and close to the most accurate in all datasets ( fig. 4 and supplementary table 4 ) .
compared with other multi - cancer biomarkers , our multi - nca signature was more accurate in the per tissue analysis than the cin , cin70 , pgc , lym , and mes signatures .
among these , the mes was the best in the per - tissue analysis while lym was first considering all datasets .
comparison of multi - cancer module evaluation functions the results reported here represented by the multi - nca biomarker were obtained using gbm as the reference cancer type minus the range of all other cancer types examined .
we also explored the performance of the network - based marker generation using other functions and other cancer types as reference .
we first tested the obvious average function , followed by the average minus the range .
as demonstrated in supplementary figure 4 , using only the average function generated the poorest performance , which was improved by subtracting the range but still lower than using gbm as the reference minus the range .
then , we tested the other three cancer types used as references : luad , ov , and brca .
interestingly , using luad as the reference generated a lower performance than that of gbm in all cancer types , whereas using ov generated almost the same overall performance as gbm .
surprisingly , using brca as the reference resulted in a better performance than that of gbm in 7 cancer types ( only luad showed a decrease ; the overall increase in performance was 0.025 ) .
discussion we used nca , a network - based algorithm , to identify biomarkers highly predictive of survival outcomes in cancer .
we first identified biomarkers for specific cancers and then identified a multi - cancer biomarker for 12 cancer types .
interestingly , the gene content varied greatly across biomarkers but the performance was similar when evaluated in each cancer type ( fig. 2d ) .
these results suggest that c - index values are more dependent on cancer type than on gene content of the biomarker .
consequently , survival outcomes may be more difficult to predict in some cancer types than in others .
for instance , survival was easier to predict in blca and coadread than in ov and gbm .
this is also supported by the fact that c - index values close to 1 for blca and coadread were not significant since random markers also showed high c - index values while c - indexes of 0.66 for ov and 0.65 in gbm were highly significant compared with random markers .
the ov - nca biomarker was the second most accurate biomarker across cancer types ( fig. 2c ) even though it was developed using the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma dataset only .
a comparison of the ov biomarker ( supplementary figure 3 ) with the multi - nca biomarker ( fig. 3 ) showed that , surprisingly , the ovarian biomarker had more connections than the multi - nca biomarker .
however , the number of differentially expressed genes , the cox model statistics , and the biological terms associated with the signature were more appropriate in the multi - nca biomarker than in the ov biomarker .
the multi - nca was able to significantly predict survival outcomes in 5 more cancer types than the ov biomarker ( fig. 2b ) , and it was more accurate in the per - tissue analysis ( fig. 4 ) than the ov biomarker .
these findings indicate that the multi - nca biomarker was more suitable for multi - cancer predictions than the ov biomarker .
nevertheless , it would be interesting to explore why the ov biomarker was highly predictive of outcomes across cancers .
although ovarian cancer was hard to predict , glioblastoma was even harder but the gbm biomarker was less accurate than the ov biomarker ( figs 2c and 4 ) , so it cannot be easily linked to prediction difficultness .
ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma can be divided into various subtypes defined by immunoreactive , mesenchymal , proliferative , and differentiated characteristics6 .
these characteristics represent universal tumorigenic processes and are observed in other types of cancer as well6 .
this heterogeneity is reflected in the relatively high number of individuals ( 578 ) included in the tcga ovarian dataset16 , although a similar number of samples was included in glioblastoma and invasive breast carcinoma ( table 1 ) .
in addition , the five genes ( jun , prkaca , smad2 , esr1 , and bcl3 ) shared by the ov and multi - nca biomarkers form a small network module and are recognized as cancer - related genes .
further analysis is needed to explore the reasons for the apparently high inter - cancer accuracy of the ov biomarker .
none of the c - index values in blca or in coadread were significant in the random model test even though the c - index values reached 1 because 46 % and 12 % of the random models respectively were equally predictive .
moreover , in blca , none of the genes were differentially expressed between risk groups .
although the low number of samples could influence these results ( only 54 samples in blca and 151 in coadread ) , confirmed results in larger cohorts would imply that many predictive signatures may exist .
in our study , the multi - nca did not depend on the number of samples per cancer type but in the nllrt of each cancer type .
thus , the selection of the best signature was imposed by other cancer types rather than by blca and coadread .
this may explain why none of the genes was significant in blca .
nevertheless , these findings do not necessarily indicate that these genes in blca are not important .
for instance , high expression of calr has been associated with high risk in bladder cancer67 .
hras gains have been found in bladder cancer cell lines and have been related to urothelial tumorigenesis68 .
itga4 is part of a methylation gene set used for the detection of bladder cancer69 .
in coadread , akt isoforms ( including akt1 ) are associated with high expression of cd133 and cd44 ( cancer stem cell markers ) and radiation resistance in colon cancer cells70 .
high expression of ddx5 ( previously known as p68 ) is related to the transition from polyp to adenoma and then to adenocarcinoma71 .
high levels of dut protein expression are predictive for tumor resistance to chemotherapy in colorectal cancer72 .
finally , up - regulation of jun is related to the invasiveness of colorectal cancer cells .
these findings clearly indicate that the biomarker genes are biologically related to blca and coadread .
the performance comparisons of the multi - nca with clinical features suggest that the multi - nca signature adds predictive power to clinical features .
nevertheless , these comparisons also showed that the predictive power of the multi - nca biomarker might vary across cancer stages .
this may indicate that the biomarker is somehow influenced by the high representation of specific cancer subtypes in the tcga studies .
for example , the results in brca were highly influenced by stage ii samples , which accounted for more than 50 % of total samples , whereas stage iv samples represented only 3 % of samples .
other cancer types showed similar staging biases .
inclusion of more samples ( as is happening with the tcga and the international cancer genome consortium datasets ) and prefiltering of data to balance stage representation may be good strategies to improve the identification of multi - cancer biomarkers .
the c - index value of our multi - nca biomarker was higher than that of other previously reported multi - cancer biomarkers , but not substantially .
the c - index values of mes and cin70 were just below that of our multi - nca biomarker .
some of the other multi - cancer biomarkers however use more genes for the prediction ( supplementary table 2 ) .
still , these comparisons highlight the fact that our multi - nca biomarker is highly competitive among the others reported .
the network - based strategy that we used emphasizes the fact that using biological information coupled with gene selection is a powerful strategy to generate biomarkers ; this conclusion is consistent with results from other studies464748495051 .
however , the network - based strategy that we used is different from other approaches in various ways ( supplementary table 5 ) .
first , we directly evaluated a cox model that is capable of identifying combinatorial features more robustly than univariate - oriented approaches47 , classifiers464951 or components48 .
second , unlike in other algorithms , we did not prefilter genes to decrease the complexity of the exploration47 .
third , we used population - dependent selection of the most improved models allowing us to explore more combinations than would be possible using other algorithms4647 .
finally , to generate a multi - cancer biomarker , we expanded the cox evaluation to multiple datasets by subtracting the range of all nllrt values from the nllrt value of a reference cancer .
we used the hprd protein - protein interaction network in our approach .
in principle , however , the nca approach can be applied to other biological networks such biogrid73 , irefweb74 , string75 , and to genetic regulatory networks such as motevo76 and the conserved transcription factor binding sites track in ucsc ( https :// genome.ucsc.edu ) .
the nca algorithm is not limited to gene expression data or to survival analysis as the response variable .
the exploration of diverse biological networks , genomic data , and response variables may lead to the identification of better or alternative multi - cancer biomarkers .
the identification of novel or alternative multi - cancer biomarkers is also valuable because such biomarkers can represent different biological phenomena that may help to elucidate specific cancer features .
for example cin70 was identified from chromosome instability32 , mes from mesenchymal transition66 , and lym from lymphocyte infiltration66 .
our multi - nca biomarker represents a protein - network - based biomarker .
in this context , our multi - nca biomarker does not share genes with other multi - cancer markers and shares only 5 genes with the ov biomarker also identified here .
we tested diverse module evaluation functions in which we varied the reference cancer type .
we observed that the biomarkers found , and their performance depended on this evaluation .
these results have deep implications : the choice of the module - growth function is critical , the function used can be improved , and the approach can generate alternative markers .
it would be interesting to explore other functions combined with more cancer types .
recent results have explored the correlation between gene expression and genomic changes such as copy number alterations77 .
in this context , the predictive power of the multi - nca biomarker appeared to be specific for gene expression because mutations and copy number alterations were not highly related ( supplementary table 6 ) .
the search for mutation signatures associated with clinical outcomes is starting30 .
given the sparseness of the mutational spectrum across cancers , it is difficult to realize that a general mutation signature could be found .
it would be exciting to see whether approaches like our proposal are capable of providing interesting solutions .
the identification of multi - cancer biomarkers may lead to proposals of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic schemes .
in this context , using dgidb78 we observed that 22 of the 41 genes of the multi - cancer biomarker were known drug targets ( supplementary table 7 ) .
thus , our approach may also shed light on which targets can be assayed in future experiments .

figure 1 schematic representation of the network clinical association algorithm ( nca ) .
starting from a single seed gene ( black ) , the first cycle generates modules that include the seed gene and each of the connected genes ( blue ) .
the 6 modules of 2 genes are then evaluated by their goodness of fit in a cox survival model .
only those grown modules that improve ( filled blue circles ) the evaluation are considered for the next grow cycle .
only a proportion of the best improved modules are further explored in the next cycle ( represented by a percentage of the distribution of all modules , shown in green , evaluated in the 4th cycle ) .
this procedure continues until no improvement is observed .
the nca algorithm was run for each cancer type and for all cancer datasets ( multi - nca ) .

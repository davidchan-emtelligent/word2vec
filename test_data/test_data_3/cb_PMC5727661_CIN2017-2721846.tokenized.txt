schizophrenia is a chronic mental disease that usually manifests psychotic symptoms and affects an individual 's functionality .
the stigma related to this disease is a serious obstacle for an adequate approach to its treatment .
stigma can , for example , delay the start of treatment , and it creates difficulties in interpersonal and professional relationships .
this work proposes a new tool based on augmented reality to reduce the stigma related to schizophrenia .
the tool is capable of simulating the psychotic symptoms typical of schizophrenia and simulates sense perception changes in order to create an immersive experience capable of generating pathological experiences of a patient with schizophrenia .
the integration into the proposed environment occurs through immersion glasses and an embedded camera .
audio and visual effects can also be applied in real time .
to validate the proposed environment , medical students experienced the virtual environment and then answered three questionnaires to assess ( i ) stigmas related to schizophrenia , ( ii ) the efficiency and effectiveness of the tool , and , finally ( iii ) stigma after simulation .
the analysis of the questionnaires showed that the proposed model is a robust tool and quite realistic and , thus , very promising in reducing stigma associated with schizophrenia by instilling in the observer a greater comprehension of any person during an schizophrenic outbreak , whether a patient or a family member .

introduction the world health organization ( who ) describes schizophrenia as one of the most serious and challenging psychiatric diseases nowadays , which still demands strong efforts in order to acquire a more solid knowledge on the pathology .
it is a complex disease categorized by distortions of thought , self - perception , and external reality , as well as inadequacy and dullness of affection [ 1 ] .
schizophrenia affects more than 21 million people worldwide , and one in every two schizophrenia - afflicted subjects does not receive care for the disease [ 2 ] , despite the fact that there are effective schizophrenia symptom - mitigation treatments and affected people can lead a productive life and be inserted into society [ 3 ] .
amongst the main schizophrenia manifestations the positive symptoms stand out , ordinarily termed psychotic symptoms , which include hallucinations and delusions , typifying the loss of the patient 's contact with reality .
negative symptoms ( mostly impairment of motivation , reduction of spontaneous speech , and social isolation ) and cognitive impairment are also considered key features of this illness [ 4 ] .
hallucinations can be defined as the perception of an object , such as voice , noise , or image , without it being present , that is , without the respective sensorial stimulus [ 5 ] .
they are experiences comparable to perception that occur without an external stimulus ; it means that the patient experiences the behavior as not being under voluntary control [ 6 ] .
in schizophrenia , hallucinations concerning visual , somatic , tactile , and olfactory modalities may take place , but the auditory ones are the most frequent indicators [ 7 ] .
over the past years , a greater access to technology has allowed the use of tools such as virtual reality ( vr ) in medicine .
vr is an instrument capable of inserting the user into an interactive three - dimensional virtual world , using a computer that can generate images and a display that presents sensory information .
over the last few decades , the use of vr in psychotic disorders , such as schizophrenia , has been a promising candidate , for example , for a clearer understanding of symptoms , for training of instrumental and social skills , and for the treatment of the disease , as an adjuvant technique [ 8 , 9 ]. with reference to the stigma , vr has been shown to be useful for diminishing negative stereotypes [ 10 ] and as a supporting device to increase empathy and positive impressions towards schizophrenic people [ 11 ] amongst other applications [ 12 - 24 ] .
in addition to the severe symptoms of the disease , patients afflicted with schizophrenia face another key trouble : the stigma .
discrimination against these patients can be perceived when they try to make or maintain friendships , look for a job , or maintain intimate or sexual relations .
moreover , discrimination often comes from members of their own family [ 25 ] .
in a study conducted in the united kingdom , it was observed that more than 70 % of the general public classified schizophrenia - afflicted people as dangerous or unpredictable [ 26 ] .
one aspect to fight the stigma is intervention in specific groups of the population , such as police authorities and health providers .
there are studies showing that training of police forces to recognize mental disorders could decrease the number of arrests and unnecessary force used against people with mental illnesses , as well as increase the adequate referral to psychiatric institutions [ 27 ] .
even though the effects of the stigma on the evolution of schizophrenia are still scarcely addressed by patients families and health practitioners , they have been observed in a number of studies .
in recent times , it has been demonstrated , for instance , that stress instigated by stigma may be related to the transition to schizophrenia in young people at risk of psychosis [ 28 ] .
habitually , the patient feels downgraded .
the disorder itself often leads to a condition of hypobulia and decreased motivation , which culminates with impaired physical conditioning .
environment - generated stimuli maybe cannot induce severe side effects , as there are no literary reports of serious symptoms generation ( e.g. , convulsive crisis ) [ 29 ] .
a number of approaches have been developed aiming at reducing the public stigma of mental illness and the damage it causes to the patient 's life .
for example , virtual environments to educate patients with schizophrenia of the hallucinations they suffer [ 30 ] .
amongst these approaches , social protest or activism , education of the public , and contact with mentally handicapped people stand out , while the latter two show positive results in the stigma reduction .
educational strategies comprise public messages , books , pamphlets , films , videos , web pages , virtual reality , and other audiovisual tools [ 31 ] .
a healthy sample of the population submitted to the demonstration of the proposed environment can reduce interrelated obstacles , for example , to the delay in the beginning of the treatment and difficulties in interpersonal and professional relationships to have a proper approach to the conditions of people afflicted this serious mental illness .
the development of a vr - based tool capable of reducing the stigma related to schizophrenia is of utmost importance to treat this disease .
to fill this gap , we propose a new augmented - reality - based tool capable of simulating the typical psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia and analyzing its effectiveness , the influence of the tool on stigmas reduction , emotional impact on users , and its validation by specialists and students of the medicine course by use and application of a questionnaire .
the proposed system can interact , in real time , with a healthy sample of the population , medical students , simulating the psychotic symptoms typical of schizophrenia .
the environment was developed with the support of a psychiatry specialist team .
appraisal of the tool effectiveness is performed by mental health specialists through three questionnaires : schizophrenia - related stigma evaluation , environment simulation evaluation , and stigma evaluation after augmented - reality simulation .
in the questionnaire assessing the schizophrenia - related stigma , volunteers' personal data , family experience in cases of schizophrenia - diagnosed persons , and a fictional history of a schizophrenia - afflicted individual were made .
for the simulation evaluation , inquiries related to the performance of the ar environment were made .
in the last questionnaire , the reassessment was made after an environment simulation of how the volunteer turned out to perceive the person from the fictional story about schizophrenia .
environment - generated stimuli should not be able to trigger serious side effects , as there are no literature reports about serious symptoms induction ( e.g. , convulsive crises ) .
simulations can be applied in educational environments ( school groups , colleges , and technical training ) in professional settings such as hospitals and clinics , and in training and awareness - raising groups that may interact with psychosis - afflicted people , such as police officers , municipal guards , and family members of disease carriers. by applying such virtual systems , connected with clinical purposes , they can play an important role in the healthcare area , as they are easily handled by the specialist as well as by the patient , being such a reassuring feature for the treatment continuousness [ 32 ] .
for example , [ 9 ] presented a pilot study to investigate the feasibility and potential negative side effects of exposure to different virtual social risk environments in patients with first episode psychosis and in healthy controls .
2. development of the proposed virtual environment virtual and augmented reality are technological tools that use virtual elements that can be inserted in realistic scenarios , becoming an alternative and complementary approach to the treatments and diagnoses , being a very promising method to be adopted definitively in the health area [ 33 ] .
virtual reality is an advanced interface for computational applications in which users can navigate and interact with a three - dimensional computer - generated environment through multisensory devices .
this technology establishes the relationship between the user and the created environment , allowing real - time integration with controlled virtual objects , and can simulate touch - screen monitors , mount - head goggles , mouse , and data glove and explore virtually freely , without real constraints like gravity , according to the immersion scenario and controls in which the user is interacting .
in it , the individual has the sensation , in real time , of interacting with the virtual world manipulating objects around it [ 34 ] .
augmented reality is a type of advanced virtual reality interface that allows the user to experience sensations through stimuli to see , hear , feel , and interact with information and virtual elements inserted in the real environment [ 35 ] .
in this work , the voices and figures were generated from the narrative of three schizophrenic patients treated at the nuesq schizophrenia outpatient clinic of frota pinto mental hospital in fortaleza , ceara .
the data collection was qualitatively focused , based on the patients' verbal description of their psychotic experiences focusing on sensory perception alterations ( auditory hallucinations and visual pseudohallucinations ) .
the evaluation was led by a psychiatrist heading the clinical follow - up of the patients under discussion .
the tool consists of a software that reproduces some schizophrenia typical psychotic symptoms in an augmented - reality environment so that healthy people can undergo a simulation and thus provides a reality immersion for a patient carrying such ailment .
in the environment , a 3 - minute duration simulation was set , as it could become tiring over an extended period of time .
at the beginning , in the tool created in the unity 3d program , a software that is used to create games and animations , an environment that could simulate what would be the reality was produced ; namely , it was able to produce an immersion to the user as close to the reality as possible .
to achieve this , a gameobject , named cubo1 was designed , aimed at conveying with its texture a camera , so that when the operator used the environment he / she could visualize the real scenario in which he / she was inserted .
after the creation of the object that would use the camera to visualize the real - time environment , pictures that would make the process of simulation of the appearances of figures ( common visual pseudohallucinations , referred by carriers ) were inserted , with 2d sprites being used as scene gameobject , which could have their humanoid or geometric shapes a little rounded , and in them a blur effect was applied ( blurred feature ) .
the human - shaped figure has its animation modeled with fade - in and fade - out effects , causing it to appear or disappear at a particular point in time according to its program design , while its total four - second appearance is the most common .
the geometric figure generally features the same outline when its animation is programmed similarly to the humanoid version , but in some cases the animation suffers the spawn effect ( when the gameobject undergoes a transformation on the x - axis from one particular point to another ) , causing the gameobject to move from side to side , with a speed script being added .
additionally , the problem of the gameobject being " spawned " though never disappearing became evident , causing a future memory error .
in consequence , a script was inserted so that it destroyed itself at a given time .
in the facial detection phase , a unity plugin called opencv for unity , which is a plugin that makes unity recognize opencv scripts used in facial detection , was used .
in the development of the facial modification a sprite ( 2d animated image ) of a blurred spot was used to cause a somber effect in the interviewees' gaze .
the effect of the facial modification lasted about 1 second , running twice during the three minutes .
the voices heard in the simulation via headphones were digitally recorded by two actors from a script prepared by the psychiatrist who piloted the interview with the volunteer patients .
the audio plays a generic content , usually heard by patients with auditory hallucinations : whispers , threatening and commanding speech , laughter , and offending content phrases .
two voices were chosen , one male and one female , based on recurrent schizophrenia hallucinatory phenomena involving voices of different characteristics that often talk to each other .
the choice of actors and nonrobotic voices was aimed at promoting authenticity and naturalness , which are distinctive of true hallucinations .
all students gave their informed consent to the procedure , which was approved by the ethics committee of escola de saude publica do ceara , ceara , brazil ( permit 1.569.510 , june 1 , 2016 ) .
2.1 .
system architecture the implementation of the proposed system is based on the use of unity as an engine of the augmented - reality environment , being used as 2d sprites scene objects produced in an image editing software .
the hmz - t2 , sony glasses , responsible for transmitting the image processor , coupled with a lifecam studio microsoft is placed in the user 's head with a panasonic rp - btgs10 phone shown in figure 1 , which uses the bone to convey sound vibrations to the nervous system , transporting the sound of the environment and not interfering in the interviewer 's voice .
figure 2 shows the integration of the devices in the system .
2.2 .
environment integration with the equipment as the purpose of this paper was to convey the psychotic symptoms to a healthy sample of the population , it demanded a good interaction of the tool with the equipment employed .
the tool consists of software that can be installed on any computer that has windows operating system with versions from win 7 .
it already has a simple interface that was created by the graphic engine unity 3d itself , being easily accessible to any user .
2.3 .
modeling and animation 2.3.1 .
modeling and audio animation sound hallucinations were created by means of sound editing software and recorded with a microphone that was emitted by a headset .
in creating the audio hallucinatory phrases noises , whispers and provocations , like " you are n't worth a thing " type were implemented .
some order phrases with " he will kill you " or " get out of here " were used in the environment audio .
while developing the audio some pauses were made .
in order to give more immersion as if a person were whispering in the ear , the procedure was applied in each and every phrase or any sound emitted by the environment , by using a sound channel coming out separately on each side of the headset .
in the environment , the user of the glasses should listen to the voice of the interviewer who would make questions to the user while he / she listened to the sound effects .
2.3.2 .
modeling and figure animation the figure , modeled on an imaging software and animated in unity , plays a major role in the augmented - reality environment , because it simulates one of the typical schizophrenia psychotic symptoms .
this is the case when a patient has hallucinations in his / her vision that cause a perception of something nonexistent , but that is a subjective impression that it is something real without external stimulus .
consistent with reports from patients the figure may have a human appearance or a blur .
to develop the figure images of a man silhouette and a flattened circumference were used , and then the blur effect was applied so that the image provided an impression of an image with twisted visual focus .
figure 3 shows model types made of figures for the environment with man silhouette , where there are more blur in figure 3 ( a ) , less blur in figure 3 ( b ) , and medium blur figure 3 ( c ) .
figure 4 illustrates the model of a circumference flattened by the sides .
the animations were constructed so that there was some relation with what was being heard with the audio mentioned .
the figure underwent a transformation of position on the x - axis corresponding to the camera and appeared in parts demarcated by the studies .
the other figures , which are the man silhouette , appeared in the extreme part of the camera view , while the fade effect was applied by varying the fade - in and fade - out time according to the sound effects .
2.3.3 .
modeling and animation of facial transformation effect in facial modification , the opencv plugin for unity available in the unity asset store was used .
plugins function to include the use of opencv in unity .
as this package is an opencv java clone , we can use the same api with opencv java 3.1.0 .
it works with unity free and pro with ios , android , windows store apps 8.1 support , windows phone 8.1 , windows 10 uwp support ( beta ) , support win , mac , and linux standalone support for editor viewing .
its image processing is in real time using the drive webcamtexture capabilities ( real - time face detection works flawlessly on iphone 5 ) .
version 1.9.0 of the plugin was used. with this plugin , we can proceed with the facial recognition and thus apply deformation and facial modification effects .
in this work , to perform the facial modification , a dark circumference , see figure 4 , was placed over the eyes , accompanying the movements of the user 's face through a 2d sprite provided by unity technologies for use in prototyping of games .
the process is aimed at simulating psychopathological changes experienced by the schizophrenia - afflicted individuals during their psychotic symptoms .
some patients report illusions involving the face of interlocutors , who may appear to patients as gloomy or even monstrous .
as such , the simulated effect causes discomfort and estrangement feelings , rendering the experience more threatening .
3. results as a result of this work , a simulator was developed in an augmented - reality environment called " schizophrenia simulator " originally designed as the proposal in this work , so that the environment could be evaluated as to the possibility of being used as a tool to help reducing the stigma with reference to schizophrenia .
in this work , the analysis was made through observations and analysis of the questionnaire based on multiple comparison to evaluate the significance of the changes in the observed parameters .
3.1 .
screenshots of the developed environment and testing used figure 5 ( a ) shows the use of an environment simulation tool by a medical student , analyzing his behavior during his interaction with the augmented - reality environment through virtual reality glasses , as well as the usability of the tool for possible adjustments for difficulties presented by users. from this test , it was acknowledged that initially the user had difficulties adjusting the glasses on his head , because in some cases the device did not fit properly because of its size .
the infrastructure used for this test was a doctor 's office of frota pinto mental hospital .
a medical consultation was performed using a simulator , in which the volunteer ( medical student ) would answer some questions in a personal , professional , and logical reasoning scheme at a time when the schizophrenia psychotic - symptom simulating environment was running .
figure 5 ( b ) shows how the medical student ( patient ) sees the visual - effect simulating figures of a schizophrenia psychotic symptom .
figure 5 ( c ) shows the facial modification effect applied in the environment visualized by the medical student ( patient ) in real time .
3.2 .
evaluation of the virtual environment in order to validate the augmented - reality environment , medical students at mental hospital frota pinto were invited to take part in a simulation of augmented - reality environment using virtual reality glasses .
they had the opportunity to use it to explore their possibilities and to analyze the feasibility of this augmented - reality environment as an alternative to help in decreasing the schizophrenia - related stigma .
twenty - one students from three universities in the state of ceara were present for the environment trial .
after using the augmented - reality environment , the medical students were submitted to three questionnaires : evaluation of the schizophrenia - related stigma , evaluation of the environment simulation , and evaluation of stigma after an augmented - reality simulation .
according to pfleeger ( 1994 ) and wohlin et al .
( 2000 ) , a questionnaire should be applied to analyze quantitative data before and / or after application of an approach .
the aim of the questionnaires was to be used as a prestudy in order to certify that important issues related to the study were anticipated , as well as to depict expectations , perceptions , and opportunities related to the possibility of the actual use of an augmented - reality environment in users as a complementary tool for understanding , stigma reduction , and prejudice .
the questionnaire to assess the schizophrenia - related stigma consisted of 9 questions ; the last one was related to jose 's story , a fictitious schizophrenic patient , in his first contact with the user , and the other 8 questions have a personal nature and asked whether there are cases of family members diagnosed with schizophrenia .
the other questionnaires ( table 1 to table 4 ) correspond to the evaluation of the proposed virtual environment on stigma reduction related to schizophrenia .
in the last questionnaire evaluating the stigma after an augmented - reality simulation , questions related to jose 's story with a postsimulation feature were made .
analyzing the results of the questionnaires application , see table 1 , it was found that in the questionnaire related to the environment simulation evaluation , on a 1 - 5 scale , of not at all to extremely , 42.85 % of medical students chose the value 5 , 42.85 % of the students considered 4 , and 14.30 % chose 3 , regarding the realism of the proposed environment in the execution of its sound effects ; 23.80 % of the medical students considered on a 1 - 5 scale , of not at all to extremely , value 5 and 47.60 % considered 4 , 14.20 % of the medical students chose 3 , and the same value chose 2 , regarding the realism of the proposed environment in the execution of its visual effects. with regard to the augmented - reality environment proposed , there is the sensation of reality immersion ( feeling of belonging to reality ) : 9.50 % of the medical students considered on a 1 - 5 scale , of not at all to extremely , the value 5 , while 57.15 % considered 4 and 28.60 % of the medical students chose 3 and 4.75 % chose 2 .
on the other hand , 80.95 % and 19.05 % of the medical students , on a 1 - 5 scale , of not at all to extremely , chose 5 and 4 , respectively , if the simulation was educational concerning the schizophrenia symptoms .
regarding whether the simulation should make users more empathetic towards schizophrenia - afflicted individuals , on a 1 - 5 scale , of not at all to extremely , 71.40 % considered the value 5 , 19.05 % considered 4 , 4.75 % indicated 3 , and the same value , 4.75 % , chose 2 .
table 1 shows the results quantitatively found with the objective questions of the questionnaire .
questions on the environment simulation evaluation questionnaire related to the symptoms experienced during or shortly after the simulation reported that 19.05 % of the medical students had a general malady ( a general sensation of discomfort and uneasiness ) , fatigue , and " heavy headache " ( due to the equipment weight ) ; 4.76 % said that they had problems with headache , dizziness with open eyes , and abdominal discomfort ( stomachache ) .
on the other hand , 38.10 % reported they had a tired eye and blurred vision .
it was found that 71.40 % of the medical students had difficulty maintaining focus and concentration ( seeing clearly and getting confused with the voices of the environment ) .
9.52 % of the users reported sweating problems ( perspiration or sweating ) and nausea ( an uncomfortable stomach feeling ) and 14.30 % reported dizziness with open eyes .
table 2 shows the analysis of the medical students' answers about the symptoms felt during or shortly after the simulation .
regarding the subjective questions , the medical students emphasize that the proposed environment stands out .
positive points .
positive points are as follows : being educational for health professionals and others , simulation in a suitable place rendering realistic effects , experience in understanding a psychotic patient 's mind , reducing stigma and prejudice , showing the reality experienced by a schizophrenic , understanding the disease symptoms , interactivity being more attractive than the conventional information practice , and empathy with the schizophrenia symptoms .
negative points .
negative points were as follows : difficulty in putting glasses on the head , discomfort using the device , simulating in a more restless setting , difficulties in viewing for glasses users , voice - audio synchronization improvement , and possibility of causing uneasiness for some individuals .
possibilities for improvement .
possibilities for improvement include improving the external environment lighting , use of vr glasses with a better and more comfortable fitting and better closing of vision , adding real people in simulations , and figure - audio synchronization improvement .
in order to evaluate the impacts on the schizophrenia - related stigma , a questionnaire that evaluated questions about a fictional patient called " jose " was applied , and these same questions were applied after using an augmented - reality environment , assessing the result changes .
appendix 2 of the questionnaire tells jose 's story .
questions and inquiries in the questionnaire comprised the following : " would i feel sorry for jose ?," " how dangerous do you think jose is ?," " how scared would you feel with jose ?," " i think jose is guilty of his present condition ," " i think it would be better for jose 's community that he be admitted to a psychiatric hospital ," " how angry would you feel about jose ?," " how likely is it that you will help jose ?," " i would try to stay away from jose ," and " do you think jose should be forced to take medical treatment , even against his will ?" on a 1 - 9 scale , in which 1 corresponds to " no or nothing " and 9 corresponds to " very or completely. " during the results analysis of the application of the questionnaire related to the evaluation of the medical students' responses ( table 3 ) on the schizophrenia - related stigma , on a 1 - 9 scale of no / nothing and very / completely , 28.57 % of the medical students gave value of 9 ; 23.80 % considered 8 ; 14.28 % chose 7 ; 6 .

after the simulation , as stated by the questionnaires , there was a trend to help the fictitious case patient .
it is important to note that there was also an increase in the trend to hospitalize the patient and to treat him / her involuntarily .
these data indicate a change of posture after the simulation : while there was an increase in empathy , there was an apparent greater impression that the presented picture is serious .
there was also an ascending trend after the simulation of considering jose dangerous .
the results demonstrated an increase in the mean stigma score from 32.05 to 35.38 ( p = 0.004 ) , with statistical significance in pity , fear , and segregation .
on the other hand , there was an increase in the average score referring to the probability of giving help , from 7.00 to 7.81 ( p = 0.034 ) .
the tool had good acceptance , demonstrated by the average scores , for use as a teaching method ( 4.8 ) , ability to increase the understanding of people with schizophrenia ( 4.57 ) , realism of sound effects ( 4.29 ) , realism of visual effects ( 3.81 ) , and sensation of immersion in reality ( 3.71 ) , on a scale from 1 ( not at all ) to 5 ( extremely ) .
in the analysis of the emotional impact of the tool on individuals submitted to the proposed environment , there was always some sort of symptom , and the most common one was the difficulty of maintaining focus and concentration .
although this was an isolated intervention , there was an increase in the mean total stigma score ; moreover , the simulation of psychotic symptoms through the augmented reality also resulted in increased scores of the possibility of helping a patient with psychosis .
in general , the proposed system obtained a good overall evaluation .
notwithstanding these positive points , further improvements in the technique will be needed in order to decrease discomfort and improve concerns related to size and portability , so that the tool can have a large - scale usage .
however , in its present form , the new tool can be used as an educational resource so that people can become more familiar with the symptoms of schizophrenia , and in doing so reducing its stigma and enhancing empathy for the patients .
the design of this study has limitations related to the long - term effect of vr in the change of attitude towards the bearer of schizophrenia .
in cross - sectional analysis it is impossible to predict whether the experiment is capable of causing lasting stigma reduction .
4. conclusion this work presented the development of an augmented - reality environment simulating the schizophrenia psychotic symptoms as an alternative tool to help reducing the schizophrenia - related stigma so that there is no delay at the beginning of treatment .
we specifically addressed the use of an augmented - reality environment through sony hmz - t2 glasses , which proved useful for the simulation of visual and auditory effects , managing to transmit the visual effects well with few exceptions , such as people wearing glasses , who could not see appropriately .
the panasonic rp - btgs10 headset , which uses bone tissue to transfer sound vibrations to the nervous system , is promising , lightweight , and affordable .
according to the results , the medical students and specialist / psychiatrist included the use of the augmented - reality environment as an educational resource for health professionals as well as for family members and society in search of reducing the disease - related stigma .
in the analysis of the emotional impact of the tool on individuals submitted to the proposed environment , it shall be noticed that there was always some sort of symptom , while the difficulty of maintaining focus and concentration was the most common one .
the tool developed in this work showed very promising results , and can be applied in educational environments ( groups of schools , colleges , and technical training ) , in hospitals and clinics , and in the training and awareness - raising of groups that may come into contact with psychosis - afflicted patients , such as police officers , municipal guards , and family members , amongst many other applications .
it will be necessary to further improve the technique in order to decrease discomfort and improve concerns related to size and portability , so that it can have a large - scale application .
in general , the new tool can be used as an educational resource so that people become more familiar with the schizophrenia symptoms , and in so doing reducing its stigma and enhancing empathy for the patients .
longitudinal evaluation studies with one or multiple exposures to the rv tool can demonstrate if the effects of the experiment are lasting over time , as well as determining the need to repeat the experiment to consolidate the expected effect .
future studies may also indicate whether the effect of immersion experience can be reinforced by supplementary psychoeducation measures such as short lectures on schizophrenia , for example .

thirty - three male rats ( 270.5 +/ - 12.8 g ) underwent maximal exercise tests to determine vo2 reserve ( vo2r ) , being randomly assigned to three groups : moderate - intensity continuous exercise at speed corresponding to 50 % vo2r ( mic ; n = 11 ) ; high - intensity continuous exercise at 80 % vo2r ( hic ; n = 11 ) ; and high - intensity intermittent exercise ( hii ; n = 11 ) at 60 % vo2r ( 3 min ) and 80 % vo2r ( 4 min ) .
exercise duration was calculated individually to elicit ee of 5 kcal in each session .
no difference between groups was found for total running distance ( mic : 801 +/ - 46 , hic : 734 +/ - 42 , hii : 885 +/ - 64 m ; p = 0.13 ) .
total ee measured by rer was systematically underestimated compared to values obtained from vo2 ( hii : 4.5 % and mic : 6.2 % , p < 0.05 ) .
total ee ( calculated from vo2 ) , and duration of hic bouts ( 2.8 kcal and 30.8 +/ - 2.2 min ) were lower ( p < 0.0001 ) than in mic ( 4.9 kcal and 64.7 +/ - 1.8 min ) and hii ( 4.7 kcal and 46.9 +/ - 2.2 min ) .
predicted and actual values of total vo2 , total ee , and duration of isocaloric sessions were similar in mic and hii ( p > 0.05 ) , which were both higher than in hic ( p < 0.0001 ) .
in conclusion , the time to achieve a given ee in exercise bouts with different intensities did not correspond to the total distance .
therefore , the volume of aerobic exercise in protocols involving wistar rats should be equalized using ee rather than total covered distance .
energy expenditure aerobic exercise exercise testing metabolism fitness introduction isocaloric exercise bouts aim to equalize the energy expenditure ( ee ) within aerobic training sessions performed with different intensities ( 1,2 ) .
ee is a surrogate for exercise volume ( understood as the interaction between training intensity , duration and frequency ) ( 3,4 ) , and controlling its influence is an important issue in experimental research ( 2,4 ) .
in fact , if the difference between intensities is high enough , exercise sessions performed with a higher intensity might also be considered of greater exercise volume ( 2,5 ) .
this can introduce bias in experiments designed to determine whether a given outcome was produced by exercise intensity or volume .
considering that several benefits of physical training measured by cardiometabolic markers are related to an increase in ee regardless of the intensity of exercise ( 6 - 12 ) , exercise bouts should be designed to be isocaloric in studies investigating the specific effects of training intensity or volume ( 13 - 15 ) .
in this context , research comparing different exercise intensities in humans adopted rigorous exercise volume equalization ( 1 ) .
this is usually accomplished by measuring the oxygen uptake ( vo2 ) during exercise to calculate ee. on the other hand , the same concern is not present in most experimental studies with rodents , which have adopted less accurate strategies to isolate the effects of exercise intensity ( 15 - 20 ) .
actually , the covered running distance has been primarily used to match the exercise volume across sessions , disregarding differences achieved in ee ( 16 - 19,21 ) .
although the assessment of covered distance allows estimation of the performed work ( 22 ) , it does not assure that ee ( and therefore volume ) is similar between two exercise sessions or that sessions are isocaloric .
for instance , it is well known that vo2 kinetics differ according to exercise intensity ( i.e. , moderate , heavy and severe ) and duration ( 23 ) , which can introduce error into the achieved ee , and consequently in the performed exercise volume .
in a practical context , the covered distance can be used to calculate the amount of performed work , but does not provide a precise estimation of total energy production during an exercise bout ( 24 ) .
on the other hand , the ee during exercise has been considered a major determinant of health - related effects ( 4,8,9 ) and its correct determination seems to be necessary to optimize the cardio - metabolic impact of physical training programs .
two major strategies have been usually applied to determine the ee during exercise : a ) the quantification of total vo2 during the exercise bout ( 4 ) ; and b ) the calculation of the corresponding energy equivalent per liter of o2 consumed ( kcal / l ) from average respiratory exchange ratio ( rer ) data ( 25 ) .
both approaches have limitations that might compromise the accuracy of ee calculation during exercise .
for instance , the quantification of total vo2 does not provide a valid representation of anaerobic ee component ( i.e. , heavy and severe exercises ) and may lead to an underestimation of the caloric expenditure and therefore , of the exercise volume ( 26 ) .
on the other hand , although the rer has been used to calculate ee , there is evidence showing that some metabolic carts are limited in ascertaining short - term changes in this variable , which would compromise the estimation of ee during exercise ( 27 ) .
therefore , a question arises : which approach ( e.g. , quantification of total vo2 or rer ) should be applied for a more accurate determination of exercise volume obtained from ee ?
to date , no study has examined which method ( ee or running distance ) would provide a greater accuracy in the equalization of exercise volume and in designing isocaloric exercise bouts for rats .
this information would be useful for experiments designed to investigate the specific effects of exercise intensity and volume measuring several outcomes .
therefore , the present study aimed to compare distinct methods for equalizing the volume of aerobic bouts performed with different intensities by wistar rats .
the duration of sessions was calculated based on ee estimated from vo2 and rer , and the total distance covered during exercise was measured .
it is hypothesized that : a ) to calculate the exercise duration using ee , equalizing the volume would be more effective than measuring the total distance covered in running bouts ; b ) to determine the duration of sessions using the ee obtained from vo2 would be more precise than using rer data .
material and methods thirty - three male wistar rats ( rattus norvegicus , 270.5 +/ - 12.8 g , 12 weeks old , anilab , brazil ) were kept under a 12 - h light - dark cycle in a temperature - controlled environment ( 22degreesc ) with free access to water and standard rat chow ( nuvital ( tm ) , brazil ) .
the experiments were performed according to principles of laboratory animal care ( nih publication no .
86 - 23 , revised 1996 ) and the protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the universidade do estado do rio de janeiro (# 06 / 2013 ) .
study design after assessing the oxygen uptake at rest ( vo2rest ) and during maximal exercise ( vo2peak ) , the animals were randomly assigned into three exercise groups : a ) moderate - intensity continuous exercise ( mic ; n = 11 ) ; b ) high - intensity continuous exercise ( hic ; n = 11 ) , and c ) high - intensity interval exercise ( hii ; n = 11 ) .
after at least 48 h of the maximal exercise grading test , the rodents underwent the exercise sessions , in a randomized counterbalanced order and within 24 - h intervals .
the vo2 , ee and total covered distance were measured in each exercise condition .
maximal graded exercise test and aerobic sessions the vo2rest and exercise vo2 were determined by indirect calorimetry via metabolic cart ( oxylet ( tm ) , panlab harvard apparatus , spain ) .
the gas analyzer was coupled to a treadmill inside a plexiglas chamber , connected through a tube to an air pump used to maintain the airflow inside the chamber .
the air flow was set at 0.5 l / min during the assessment at rest , and 2.0 l / min during maximal exercise , according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
another tube was connected to the gas analyzer , which continuously measured relative concentrations of oxygen ( o2 ) and carbon dioxide ( co2 ) outflowing from the chamber ( 28 ) .
the vo2 was calculated by a software ( metabolism ( tm ) , panlab harvard apparatus ) , using equations described elsewhere ( 29 ) .
standard conditions of temperature , pressure and humidity were kept in all experiments .
the vo2rest was assessed during 30 min and the average of the last 5 min was recorded as final result ( 30 ) .
in order to avoid circadian influence , measurements were taken at the beginning of the animal 's dark cycle .
prior to vo2peak assessment , in maximal exercise testing , the rats underwent adaptation sessions to the treadmill for 3 days , with speed set at 10 m / min during 10 - 15 min , as previously described ( 31,32 ) .
maximal exercise tests were applied 24 - 48 h following the adaptation sessions .
the testing protocol consisted of load increments of 5 m / min every 3 min ( 28 ) , until the rats were no longer able to run .
exhaustion was determined when animals remained at the end of the metabolic chamber , at the shock grid for 5 s .
vo2peak corresponded to the highest vo2 obtained during the maximal exercise test ( 28 ) .
the target workload during submaximal exercise bouts was calculated using the oxygen uptake reserve ( vo2r ) method , as previously described ( 5 ) : vo2r = ( fraction intensity ) x ( vo2peak - vo2rest )+ vo2rest .
the relative intensity was defined according to each group .
animals assigned to mic and hic exercised at speeds corresponding to 50 and 80 % of vo2r , respectively .
exercise sessions for hii consisted of alternate phases corresponding to 60 % vo2r ( 3 min ) and 80 % vo2r ( 4 min ) .
these exercise protocols were based on previous studies with rats ( 17,20 ) .
running speeds corresponding to relative intensities were calculated individually , based on vo2 obtained during the maximal exercise testing ( 1 ) .
calculation of exercise bout duration based on energy expenditure the duration of isocaloric bouts was calculated as follows : a ) first , relative values of vo2r ( ml.kg - 1.min - 1 ) were converted to absolute values ( l / min ) ; b ) the ee was then calculated ( kcal / min ) assuming an energy equivalent of 5.0 kcal for each liter of o2 consumed ( 27 ) , and c ) the time spent to achieve the targeted total ee ( set at 5.0 kcal ) was calculated by the ratio between total ee and absolute ee corresponding to vo2r in each exercise condition ( mic , hic and hii ) ( 33 ) .
after establishing the speed and duration of the exercise bouts , animals underwent two exercise sessions , during which vo2 and total covered distance were individually calculated by means of indirect calorimetry system ( panlab harvard apparatus ) .
the ee during exercise was determined from the vo2 ( l ) assessed during the isocaloric exercise bouts ( table 1 ) .
the caloric cost of exercise sessions was also calculated using rer , as previously described ( 19 ) .
in this procedure , the ee per liter of o2 consumed ( kcal / l ) obtained from average rer during the exercise is multiplied by the target vo2 ( l / min ) , and this result is then multiplied by the bout duration to obtain total ee ( kcal ) .
step - by - step procedures to measure the caloric cost of exercise using rer are shown in table 2 .
statistical analysis normal distribution of data was confirmed by the kolmogorov - smirnov test and , therefore , results are reported as means +/ - se. comparisons for running speed between groups , vo2 , ee , total distance and duration of exercise sessions were made using one - way anova followed by tukey post hoc .
paired t - tests were used to test differences between estimated and measured outcomes in each exercise group .
in all cases significant level was set at p <= 0.05 , and calculations were performed using the software graphpad prism version 5.00 for windows ( graphpad ( tm ) , usa ) .
results table 3 exhibits data assessed at rest and during maximal exercise .
no significant difference was found between groups for vo2rest , vo2peak , and maximal speed achieved in the maximal exercise testing .
running speeds for different conditions and groups are shown in figure 1 .
mic and hic groups exercised at 19.7 +/ - 0.8 and 29.8 +/ - 0.8 m / min , respectively , while running speed in hii ranged between 29.8 +/ - 1.4 and 22.3 +/ - 1.0 m / min .
significant differences were found between speeds performed during exercise in 80 % vo2r hii vs 60 % vo2r hii ( p < 0.0001 ) , 80 % hii vs 50 % mic ( p < 0.0001 ) , 80 % hic vs 60 % hii ( p < 0.0001 ) and 80 % hic vs 50 % mic ( p < 0.0001 ) .
as expected , no significant difference was found between 80 % vo2r hii vs 80 % hic ( p = 0.59 ) .
figure 2 shows data for running speed multiplied by distance ( figure 2a ) , and running speed multiplied by exercise duration ( figure 2b ) .
these calculations provide results of intensity ( running speed ) in combination with volume components ( distance or duration ) .
significant differences were found only in regards to running speed vs distance data ( figure 2a ) : the product between speed and distance was significantly lower in mic than in hii ( p < 0.01 ) and hic ( p < 0.0001 ) .

table 4 reports results for estimated and measured exercise volume ( represented by total ee and vo2 ) , workload ( represented by target ee and vo2 ) , and duration .
the target work vo2 was higher in hii than mic ( p < 0.0001 ) , while no difference was found for estimated total ee either from vo2 ( p = 0.66 ) or rer ( p = 0.48 ) .
on the other hand , total ee ( from both vo2 and rer ) was lower in hic than in both mic and hii ( p < 0.0001 ) .
only hic exhibited significant discrepancy between predicted and measured values for total vo2 ( p < 0.0001 ) , total ee ( p < 0.0001 ) , and duration of exercise bout ( p < 0.0001 ) .
despite of the disparities between protocols in regards to vo2 and ee , no significant difference between groups could be detected for the total distance covered in the exercise sessions ( mic : 801 +/ - 46 m ; hic : 726 +/ - 45 m ; hii : 885 +/ - 64 m ; p = 0.13 ) .
the ee during exercise calculated from vo2 was higher than calculated from rer in all groups ( p < 0.0001 ) .
the total ee calculated from rer was underestimated compared to values obtained from vo2 in hii ( 4.67 +/ - 0.1 vs 4.88 +/ - 0.2 kcal ; p = 0.04 ) and mic ( 4.47 +/ - 0.2 vs 4.75 +/ - 0.2 kcal ; p = 0.02 ) , but not in hic ( 2.80 +/ - 0.2 vs 2.93 +/ - 0.2 kcal ; p = 0.63 ) .
discussion the present study compared different methods for equalizing the exercise volume performed with different intensities by wistar rats .
the main findings were : a ) the exercise performed with different intensities elicited similar total distances , but different ee ; b ) the ee estimated from vo2 was systematically higher than using rer. additionally , an original strategy to design isocaloric aerobic exercise sessions for rats has been provided , based on procedures often applied in studies with humans ( 1,4,5 ) .
our findings demonstrated that although rats in the three intensity groups had covered similar distances during the exercise bouts , hic did not reach the predicted total ee. actually , for a given amount of ee ( e.g. , isocaloric conditions ) the distance covered by the animals in hic was greater than in mic and hii .
it is worth mentioning that early fatigue was more present in hic than in the other groups .
apparently , the animals were not able to keep the intensity for the time estimated to achieve the predicted ee. on the other hand , due to the higher speed , this fact did not affect the total distance covered during the exercise .
in brief , matching the aerobic bouts using the covered distances in this case would overestimate the ee and therefore the exercise volume .
this validates our hypothesis that equalizing the distance during exercise does not necessarily assures that sessions are isocaloric and elicit equal exercise volume , as assumed by prior studies ( 17,20,21 ) .
the distance covered during running exercise provides only a crude estimate of ee ( or performed work ) ( 22 ) .
the ee ( assessed by vo2 or rer ) reflects more precisely the metabolic demand , being acknowledged as a better marker of exercise volume ( 4 ) .
it has been shown that animals may cover similar distances during equivalent aerobic exercise duration while exhibiting distinct caloric expenditures due to several factors , such as mechanical efficiency or aerobic capacity ( 34,35 ) .
this is not different in humans , since it is well known that total ee and vo2 are not necessarily the same in subjects that run or walk identical distances ( 36 ) .
therefore , using covered distance to estimate ee may introduce bias and should be avoided when investigating the specific effects of exercise intensity .
the caloric cost of running in our sample is in agreement with data reported in the classical study by katch et al .
( 19 ) ( 4.8 vs 5.2 kcal / h , respectively ). that was probably the first study demonstrating that ee estimated from rer could be used to equalize the exercise volume within animal research models .
interestingly , subsequent investigations comparing different intensities exercise bouts performed by animals did not take those results into consideration ( 16,17,20,21,37,38 ) .
in this sense , the present study adds to the current knowledge by revisiting the pioneer work by katch et al .
( 19 ) and validating the calculation of ee as a preferential strategy to equalize the volume of aerobic exercise bouts .
furthermore , our findings suggest that estimating the exercise duration based on ee calculated from vo2 would be more adequate than using rer , in the case of wistar rats .
prior studies have pointed limitations in regards to the use of rer obtained by open - circuit indirect calorimetry to calculate ee in rodents .
factors such as oscillation in the interconversion of macronutrients or lack of stability in pool sizes of co2 and o2 make the interpretation of short - term changes in rer difficult ( 27 ) .
in this sense , transient changes in rer particularly present in exercise performed with high intensity and intermittently could be undetected by this system , because of the delay between collection and analysis of the air collected from the chamber ( 27 ) .
the present results concur with this premise , since the ee estimated from rer was significantly lower than values obtained from vo2 .
the rer alone also failed to detect differences in the metabolic demand induced by hii and mic ( rer : 0.77 +/ - 0.01 vs 0.76 +/ - 0.01 , p = 0.37 , respectively ; ee : 71.8 +/ - 2.1 vs 101.4 +/ - 4.5 cal / min , p = 0.0001 , respectively ) .
in brief , the calculation of ee from vo2 instead of rer allowed a more precise estimation of the caloric cost of exercise .
this information is especially useful in research settings , since the use of vo2 avoids the need to submit the rats to extra sessions ( two or more ) , in order to confirm the total ee achieved .
two methodological approaches have been predominantly applied in the literature to calculate isocaloric exercise sessions ( 5,33 ) : either using gross ee or net ee. gross ee is defined as the total amount of energy spent during a specific activity , including resting ee ; on the other hand , net ee corresponds to the caloric expenditure specifically induced by the exercise bout , being computed as the difference between gross ee and resting ee ( 5,33 ) .
although in humans the use of net ee is often recommended to avoid overestimation of weight loss induced by exercise programs ( 5 ) , in the present study we have adopted the gross ee instead of net ee. findings of a pilot study that preceded our experiments ( unpublished data ) showed that the exercise bout duration was overestimated when using net ee ( 109 % at 50 % vo2r , and 87 % at 80 % vo2r ) , therefore underestimating the ee for a given workload .
gross ee provided a more acceptable and feasible range of durations for the exercise bouts .
the overestimation of exercise duration with net ee probably occurred due to the fact that rats exhibit higher metabolic rate than humans at rest (~ 26.5 vs ~ 3.5 ml.kg - 1.min - 1 , respectively ) ( 26,39 ) and during exercise ( 40 ) .
compared to rats , humans have a large amount of fat mass with low contribution to overall metabolism .
on the other hand , rats expend calories more easily due to higher metabolic rate of their fat tissue and greater heat loss through body surfaces ( 27 ) .
thus , unlike humans , to rats exercise represents a large and significant additional caloric cost to maintain their vital processes ( 26,34 ) .
in order to calculate the net ee it is necessary to exclude the values at rest , which represent approximately 35 % of maximal ee in rats , resulting in significant overestimation when calculating the duration of exercise bouts .
this overestimation of exercise duration due to the use of net ee resulted in an error of ~ 5 kcal added in each session , regardless of the intensity of exercise ( i.e. , twice the value provided by gross ee ) .
hypothetically , such inherent error in the calculations could have a high impact on exercise prescription and expose the animals to unnecessary risk due to prolonged metabolic demand and physiological stress .
given the lack of studies investigating how to estimate the duration of isocaloric sessions in rats , our data provide useful information demonstrating that gross ee ( converted from target vo2r ) , is a valid and reproducible strategy to equalize the volume of aerobic exercise .
this method represents a viable alternative to accurately predict individual ee during exercise bouts and equalize the amount of training volume in studies with rodents .
in practical terms , this means that additional measurements of vo2 during the exercise sessions would not be necessary .
in conclusion , our findings indicate that the exercise volume within aerobic exercise bouts in wistar rats should be equalized by using the time to reach a given amount of ee , rather than the total distance covered during exercise sessions .
in order to design isocaloric exercise sessions in rats , procedures similar to those adopted in humans appear to be adequate ; that is , after measuring maximal vo2 and converting a particular relative intensity (% vo2 ) into kcal / min , the time to achieve a targeted ee can be estimated using the speed corresponding to that intensity .
further research , however , is warranted to verify the reproducibility and precision of these procedures in different rat strains , as well as to investigate their applicability in studies with other animal models .

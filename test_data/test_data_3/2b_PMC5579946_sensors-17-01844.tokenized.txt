one of the crucial actions to be performed during a grasping task is to avoid slippage .
the human hand can rapidly correct applied forces and prevent a grasped object from falling , thanks to its advanced tactile sensing .
the same capability is hard to reproduce in artificial systems , such as robotic or prosthetic hands , where sensory motor coordination for force and slippage control is very limited .
in this paper , a novel algorithm for slippage detection is presented .
based on fast , easy - to - perform processing , the proposed algorithm generates an on / off signal relating to the presence / absence of slippage .
the method can be applied either on the raw output of a force sensor or to its calibrated force signal , and yields comparable results if applied to both normal or tangential components .
a biomimetic fingertip that integrates piezoresistive mems sensors was employed for evaluating the method performance .
each sensor had four units , thus providing 16 mono - axial signals for the analysis .
a mechatronic platform was used to produce relative movement between the finger and the test surfaces ( tactile stimuli ) .
three surfaces with submillimetric periods were adopted for the method evaluation , and 10 experimental trials were performed per each surface .
results are illustrated in terms of slippage events detection and of latency between the slippage itself and its onset .
slippage tactile sensor algorithm prosthetics robotics 1 .
introduction tactile sensing is fundamental for enhancing performance of robotic systems in unstructured environments .
moreover , in the last years the interaction of robots with the surrounding environment is increasingly moving more and more towards the inclusion of human beings , in addition to inanimate objects [ 1 ] .
this implies the need of advanced sensing capabilities to effectively interact with people and successfully grasp and manipulate objects .
in particular , tactile sensing plays a paramount role to : ( a ) gather information about the object properties , e.g. , shape and hardness , and about the interaction forces , and ( b ) properly detect slippage phenomena that may occur during manipulation and grasping tasks .
robotic end effectors are the devices at the end of robot kinematic chains .
they can be grippers or also robotic hands .
they should be able to control slip events in a dexterous manner , and to avoid grasp instability or else damages to the objects .
while the robotic end effector performs an action or handles an object , unpredictable events might occur , which hinder the success of the action ; the availability of control strategies relying on tactile sensory feedback could greatly increase robot performance when facing such a situation .
to date , the number of applications using tactile information is limited [ 1 ] .
depending on the technology , tactile sensors still suffer from certain drawbacks , such as hysteresis , non - linearity and sensitivity to environment ( e.g. , temperature ) .
the resulting lack of reliability leads robotic end effectors to mainly act within structured environments , without relying on tactile information .
even when they are endowed with tactile sensory system , the dexterity of the human hand is highly difficult to mimic .
indeed , tactile sensory systems are not capable of measuring all the tactile properties ( contact forces , slippage , temperature , roughness , texture , hardness , etc. ) as human tactile sensing can do simultaneously .
further , most tactile sensors can only be used either for static or dynamic sensing , but not both .
much research was performed in the last decades , yet the biological tactile system is not satisfactorily reproduced .
for this reason , improving tactile information can predispose the robots towards a more natural behavior , including e.g. , their reactions to unexpected events and situations .
sensory feedback from tactile sensors would be of great help in many robotic domains , such as robotic manipulation and prosthetics .
nonetheless , the current state of the art regarding commercial prosthetic hands reports only one case of a device provided with feedback , from tactile or force sensors and employed for slip control [ 2 ] ; this confirms that tactile sensing technologies , including slip detection , are not easily applicable to prosthetic systems yet , despite the considerable efforts of the last years [ 3 ] .
moreover , it is worth noticing that the number of research groups and activities focused on tactile sensing has traditionally been lower than on other sensing principles ( e.g. , artificial vision ) , thus leading to a slower development of the tactile technology [ 4 ] .
the literature proposes plenty of tactile sensors and procedures for slippage detection .
in tactile sensing applications , a critical issue is the integration of static ( force / pressure measurement ) and dynamic ( slip detection ) information .
the main approach used until the end of last century relied on the calculation of the static friction coefficient from normal and tangential force measurements [ 5,6 ] .
this requires a multiaxial force sensor in order to measure forces at least along two axes ( including the normal one ) ; as an alternative , tangential forces can be analyzed in the frequency domain [ 7,8 ] by resorting to fast fourier transform ( fft ) , discrete fourier transform ( dft ) and power spectrum density ( psd ) , or else estimated by means of kalman filters [ 9 ] .
other methods take into account the variations of the center of pressure [ 10,11 ] .
a tri - axial force sensor featuring a carbon micro - coil ( cmc ) for slippage detection was fabricated in [ 12 ] .
a widespread solution is to combine more sensing units for static and dynamic information .
to this purpose , force sensors can be jointly used with piezoelectric ( such as polyvinylidene fluoride ( pvdf ) or lead zirconate titanate ( pzt )) sensors for slip management [ 13,14,15 ] .
moreover , the employment of accelerometers as slippage sensors was also demonstrated in various scenarios [ 16,17,18 ] .
in [ 19 ] a slippage sensor based on conductive rubber was proposed , which was able to detect slippage phenomena through the application of the continuous wavelet transform .
however , the aforementioned sensor was not able to measure forces .
further methods exploit the derivative function of the normal component of the estimated force [ 20 ] , or else , the vibrations in a fluid sealed into the core of a biomimetic sensor [ 21,22 ] .
this is the case of the commercial sensor biotac ( by syntouch , montrose , ca , usa ) , which is able to provide slippage information by means of a band - pass filtered signal of a fluid pressure measurement in the 10 - 1040 hz range .
all the reported works present sensors and / or techniques for the detection of slippage often resorting to force measurement on more axes .
in this paper , a new method [ 23 ] for the detection of slippage events is proposed ; it provides an on / off slip information thanks to online processing of a force sensor output .
simple operations such as digital filtering , rectification and envelope of the input signal are cascaded in order to generate the on / off slip signal .
the method can be applied to every type of piezoresistive sensors , regardless the number of force axes : i.e. , each available axial component might be processed in the same way , though one is sufficient for the generation of the on / off slip signal .
indeed , the difficulty of measuring slippage events starting only from normal force signal is well known [ 24 ] ; by applying the proposed method to the voltage output of a simple , low cost mono - axial sensor ( i.e. , normal axis ) , it is possible to obtain information about slippage along with the force information itself .
an application of the method to mono - axial force sensors for force and slippage control of a prosthetic hand is presented in [ 25 ] .
here , the proposed method will be explained in detail and its experimental validation on a tactile array including microelectromechanical system ( mems ) piezoresistive force sensors will be illustrated .
each sensor in the array is composed of four sensitive units ; hence , 16 " channels " are taken into account for detecting slippage , considered as mono - axial components .
the raw voltage from all the channels is employed as input for the algorithm .
it is possible to convert such an input into a force signal by using calibration matrices [ 26 ] ; nonetheless , the voltage signal contains all the necessary information for applying the proposed slippage detection algorithm .
this approach is highly convenient for online applications , e.g. , a robotic hand control system .
indeed , force computation and slip detection from the voltage output can be performed in parallel rather than subsequently , thus speeding up the process .
during the validation trials , slippage was induced by controlling the sliding velocity of the surface in contact with the sensors , which were embedded into a prosthetic finger ( see section 3 ) .
a mechatronic platform operated the surface movement , reproducing in this way the slippage event .
the slippage detection method was tested on three surfaces with sub - millimetric periods ( ranging from 400 microm to 480 microm ) , using a set of experiments composed of 10 trials for each surface .
such surfaces were chosen for a first rigorous validation as the one shown in the present paper .
however , the method was also tested with flat surfaces having roughness values up to 0.2 microm [ 23 ] , using different piezoresistive sensors .
these tests , along with the experiments carried out with common objects in [ 25 ] , indicated a scarce influence of the material properties towards the algorithm output .
even though periodic surfaces were adopted , this paper does not aim at providing a technique for surface pattern discrimination .
to this end , literature offers solutions like the one in [ 27 ] ; nevertheless , slippage identification is not concerned , as greater attention is paid to the roughness encoding by means of mems tactile sensors .
a biomimetic tactile sensor is used in [ 28 ] to understand how human mechanoreceptors code textural information during exploratory tasks .
very limited speeds ( 0.2 mm / s ) were set , thus not investigating slippage conditions .
advanced hardware for composite tactile imaging was developed in [ 29 ] , allowing to reconstruct spatial profile of applied pressure .
although the considerable technological advance , the study neglected the analysis of slippage phenomena .
the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 the slippage detection procedure is presented in detail , describing the different blocks with the main characteristics .
section 3 illustrates the experimental setup that was employed for the evaluation of the method , together with the sensors .
in section 4 experimental data elaboration and results are discussed .
finally , section 5 points out the conclusions and the future work .
2. slippage detection procedure 2.1 .
theoretical description of the method the proposed method consists of three main blocks in cascade between the input signal , which is the raw voltage output of the employed force sensor , and the on / off output , which is the final slippage signal .
figure 1 shows the blocks .
although the calibrated force information is not used as input , it should be noticed that the algorithm output somehow depends from the applied pressure level , i.e. , the higher the exerted pressure on the sensor is , the higher the amplitude of the signal available for the on / off signal generation is. however , the applied pressure is directly proportional to the raw voltage , allowing to exploit the latter without loss of information .
the variation of the voltage signal with respect to the baseline ( which ranges between 4.3 v and 4.35 v , figure 2 ) , due to an applied force , is characterized by high amplitude and low frequencies in absence of slippage .
when the sensor is slid over a surface ( active touch ) , or vice - versa when the surface is slid on the sensor ( passive touch ) , the voltage signal carries a higher frequency content and has a smaller amplitude .
such a content can be extracted by means of filtering operations : adequate cut - off frequencies and bandwidth are defined depending on the type of sensor and on its specific structure .
thus , the low frequencies of the original voltage signal are filtered out , by privileging the faster variations produced by slip .
at this point , a low amplitude , high frequency signal is generated ; the presence of dense fluctuations indicates that the relative movement between the object and the sensor is occurring .
the filtering operation is computed together with an opportune amplification ( block 1 ) and is followed by the rectification and exponentiation of the signal ( block 2 ) , which is in turn followed by an enveloping phase ( block 3 ) .
an on / off signal relative to the onset of a slippage event is then generated .
the algorithm blocks are described in detail below .
2.1.1 .
filter network the filtering operations are responsible for the high frequency extraction from the force ( voltage ) signals .
thus , it is crucial to accurately design the filter parameters in order to obtain proper performance .
a band - pass configuration was chosen for controlling the whole bandwidth , though a high - pass filter can also be adopted .
the most general configuration of the method requires one to fix the low cut - off frequency fcol around 7 - 10 hz , in order to avoid the signal slow variations due to the applied force. by filtering the signal content up to a high cut - off frequency fcoh equal to 50 hz , the vibrations generated by the slippage can be adequately isolated , and relayed to the next elaboration stages .
nonetheless , the solution implemented in this work is general ; the bandwidth can also be varied , depending on the sensor structure and output .
for the filters network , infinite impulse response ( iir ) causal filters were designed .
iir filters are computationally more efficient than the finite impulse response ( fir ) type , while the causality is fundamental for a real - time implementation .
a 4th - order butterworth filter was employed .
it can be expressed by means of its transfer function hb ( z ) as : ( 1 ) hb ( z )= gbsumn = 0nbnz - nsumn = 0manz - n , and : ( 2 ) y ( z )= hb ( z ). x ( z ) is the filtered output in the z - domain , with the possibility to control the filtered signal amplitude through a gain gb. in equation ( 1 ) n = m is the filter order while in equation ( 2 ) x ( z ) is the input piezoresistive signal .
equation ( 1 ) also gives an idea of how the filter order influences the transfer function .
the polynomials complexity augments with the order ; this adds delay to the system , even though the filter performance is improved .
additional digital 4th - order stop - band filters , can be cascaded to the butterworth one .
a flat response in the pass - band region was searched , as well as a quick roll - off transition to the stop - band region .
in figure 2a , a general example of filtered signal is illustrated together with the original unfiltered piezoresistive signal .
the choice of high order filters , higher than three , is due to the necessity of achieving fast roll - off .
in this way , frequency components outside the range of interest might be easily discarded , including frequencies near the bandwidth limits .
nevertheless , the filter order must be carefully chosen considering equation ( 1 ) , avoiding too much elevate values .
2.1.2 .
rectification the filtering stage provides a high frequency signal , yet characterized by a bipolar nature .
the rectification can improve the subsequent thresholding .
in figure 2b an example of rectification is provided. by inverting the polarity of the negative spikes , the time window where the signal is on ( i.e. , above threshold ) can be longer than in the case of a bipolar signal .
a full - wave rectification , or at least a half - wave rectification needs to be performed .
moreover , to privilege the slip signal content with respect to the peaks due to contact and release phases , the exponentiation of the signal amplitude was computed .
indeed , these peaks may sometimes be present although the stop - band filters have a great impact on the signal .
the amplitude of such peaks is commonly smaller than the true positives ; exponentiation helps to increase the amplitude difference between false positives and true ones .
to this end , the filtered and rectified signal can be raised to the third power , and whole process is described by the following mathematical function hf + r ( z ) : ( 3 ) hf + r ( z )= hf ( z ). hf *( z *) 3 / 2where : ( 4 ) hf ( z )= hb ( z ). he1 ( z ). he2 ( z ) i.e. , hf ( z ) represents the transfer function of the overall filters network , comprised of the filters described in section 2.1.1 .
the network includes two stop - band filters he1 ( z ) and he2 ( z ) , briefly described in section 3 .
the filtered and rectified signal y ( z ) becomes : ( 5 ) yf + r ( z )= | hf | 3.x ( z ) 3 = x ( z ) 2.hf ( z ). hf *( z *) 32 2.1.3 .
envelope finally , the envelope of the signal is calculated by means of root mean square ( rms ) .
the rms value envrms is obtained as follows : ( 6 ) envrms = 1wsumr = w1w2xr2where w = w2 - w1 corresponds to the temporal width of the selected window , and xr is a single sample included within w. the rectified signal yr + f ( z ) was divided into windows with an equal width h ; every window wi almost totally overlaps the adjacent one wi + 1 , since they are computed as : ( 7 ) wi =[ yr + f ( i ) , yr + f ( i + 1 )... yr + f ( i + h )] ( 8 ) wi + 1 =[ yr + f ( i + 1 ) , yr + f ( i + 2 )... yr + f ( i + h + 1 )] i.e. , the overlap is shifted by one sample from a window to the next one .
the envelope acts as a low pass filter ; it generates a continuous curve starting from the peaks of the rectified signal .
figure 2c gives an example of enveloped signal .
at this point , the on / off slip signal can be obtained with a threshold mechanism ( see section 4 ) .
more details about the chosen time window will be provided in section 4 .
3. experimental setup , protocol and algorithm implementation the described algorithm was applied to the raw voltage outputs of a 2 x 2 array of piezoresistive mems sensors that were integrated in a biomimetic fingertip [ 27 ] .
each sensor had four piezoresistors implanted at the roots of a cross - shape structure that transduced the forces acting on a mesa .
the sensors were covered by a polymeric packaging material ( dragonskin , smooth - on , macumgie , pa , usa ) , with 10 shore a hardness and about 0.8 mm thickness .
the area of mechanical contact sensorized by the 16 channels was about 22 mm2 .
the experiments were carried out under a passive touch protocol : the fingertip was static and a plastic plate was put into contact and then slid by means of a 2 degrees of freedom tactile stimulation platform [ 30 ] .
it allowed implementing trials with versatile reconfiguration of stimulation conditions .
briefly , the platform had horizontal and vertical translational degrees of freedom .
the horizontal axis was operated by means of a linear guide ( ltp 60.180.0804 - 02 , skf multitec , goteborg , sweden ) , actuated with a dc motor ( re35 , maxon motors , sachseln , switzerland ) , with position tracking error lower than 30 microm up to 25 mm / s sliding velocity .
the vertical axis was operated by means of a voice coil ( ncc05 - 18 - 060 - 2x , h2w tech. , santa clarita , ca , usa ) , with force tracking error lower than 20 mn [ 28 ] .
the platform was previously shown not to introduce spurious vibrations that could be perceived by humans .
this was confirmed by a set of experiments involving the recording of neural activity of rapidly adapting ( meissner ) mechanoreceptors [ 30 ] .
the purpose of the protocol was to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to : ( 1 ) identify the onset of the sliding phase ; ( 2 ) separate the slippage from the loading and unloading phases that were included in the experimental procedure .
during the contact phases the interaction force was kept at 400 mn , and the plastic plate was moved at 6.7 mm / s for 1.5 s and subsequently at 10 mm / s for 1 s. the trial time t was set at 6.5 s , as the slippage lasted 2.5 s while 2 s elapsed between the finger contact on the platform and the start of the movement ; the same time interval occurred between the end of the slippage and the finger release .
three plates were tested , with 10 experimental repetitions per plate , for the sake of evaluating the generalization abilities of the proposed algorithm with different surfaces .
the plates differed for the spatial period deltap ( 400 , 440 and 480 microm ) of the pattern of ridges and grooves that alternated along its surface .
the height of the ridges of the stimuli was as little as 100 microm to test the capability of the system to identify slippage with a surface having a fine patterning .
in this work , all experimental data were acquired at a sample rate of 380 hz. more details about the experimental setup ( figure 3b,c ) can be found in [ 27 ] .
additional tests with different piezoresistive sensors and flat surfaces characterized by roughness up to 0.2 microm can be retrieved in [ 23 ] .
the algorithm was applied to each channel of the biomimetic fingertip , thus generating 16 on / off signals to identify the occurrence of local slippage events .
the 16 on / off signals were then grouped taking into account the channels physical orientation ; a single global on / off slippage alerting signal was finally generated .
four groups of four channels each were created : ( 1 ) transversal proximal ( tp ) orientation ; ( 2 ) transversal distal ( td ) orientation ; ( 3 ) longitudinal ulnar ( lu ) orientation ; ( 4 ) longitudinal radial ( lr ) orientation .
figure 3a shows the allocation of the sensing units on the biomimetic fingertip , while table 1 groups them with respect to their orientation .
for all the four groups , the on / off signal obtained from every channel was put into an and operator , resulting in four on / off signals .
subsequently , the logical or operator was applied to the four on / off signals for the determination of the final on / off signal .
the basic concept is the following : the presence of local slip phenomena is investigated on every possible direction , both transversal and longitudinal ; the and operator allows reducing the detection of false positives , which mainly occur during the contact and release phases , thus having a robust local slip identification ; the or operator allows detecting the slippage as soon as it is detected on at least one direction , thus converting any identified local slip into a global alert .
the high cut off frequency fcoh of the band - pass filter was set to twice the highest expected fundamental frequency ( i.e. , 25 hz ) based on the experimented spatial periods of the plates deltap and their sliding velocity v. however , fcoh might be differently chosen without deterioration of the algorithm efficacy , as it will be shown in section 4 .
the gain gb was set to 100 in order to amplify the small vibrations due to slip .
two additional digital 4th - order stop - band filters , i.e. , elliptic filters , were cascaded to the butterworth one .
their transfer functions he1 ( z ) ( low filter ) and he2 ( z ) ( high filter ) were set with unitary gain , while the pass - band ripple ( peak to peak ) and the stop - band attenuation were set to 0.01 db and 40 db respectively .
they were conceived to inhibit the frequency content below the low limit of the bandpass filter ( low filter ) and above its high limit ( high filter ) .
rectification ( full - wave ) , exponentiation and enveloping operations were performed as described in section 2 .
as regards the on / off computation , it is important to focus on the width of the temporal window employed .
the computational operations described in section 2 , including the final on / off decision , were accomplished by setting the time window width to 40 ms. this value resulted from a trade - off between : ( 1 ) the necessity to achieve a computational time below the physiological time needed to respond to slip events ( i.e. , > 70 ms [ 31,32 ]) ; ( 2 ) the correct detection of the slippage , reducing the detection of false positives .
figure 4 illustrates the output from one of the tactile units during a trial , and the result of the algorithm ( on / off signal ) calculated with different time windows .
the enveloped signal is considered to be on if its average value within the time window overcomes an empirically established threshold .
the threshold can be adjusted according to the employed sensor technology ; it may vary from a kind of sensor to the other .
in this case , it was set to 0.5 v .
4. experimental results first , it is crucial to evaluate the delay d between the beginning of the platform movement with respect to the biomimetic finger , and the off to on transition of the slip signal .
the time instant tst at which the platform starts moving was computed as follows : ( 9 ) tst ={ t1int | dxpl ( t ) dt != 0 } i.e. , the time instant t1 at which the platform position value xpl is different from the previous one , is considered as the start of the relative movement during the trial time interval t. in other words , the minimum measurable displacement ( according to the sampling frequency ) has been regarded as the commencement of the slippage .
in this way , a rigorous evaluation was carried out , with movements lower than 5 microm considered as the start of the slippage phase .
as already explained in section 3 , the time window for the algorithm execution was regulated accounting for the physiological response time as well .
similarly , the delay d has to be lower than 70 ms , possibly not greater than 50 ms as d does not include the efferent response ( i.e. , the reaction to the identified slip ) , but only the afferent one .
this means that slippage detection has to be followed by an opportune reaction ( either of the robot or the human ) in terms of force adjustment .
table 2 summarizes the mean values mdi for all the trials carried out for the three deltaps .
these values were obtained based on the position measured by an optical encoder embedded in the mechatronic platform .
they were computed with respect to tst as described by equation ( 9 ) .
all the values in table 2 were calculated as : ( 10 ) mdi,deltapj = sumk = 116chk16where i is the trial number , deltapj is the corresponding deltap and k is the channel number .
such values resulted to be acceptable (< 50 ms ) in most cases .
these data can be further synthetized by observing the mean values mddeltap for every deltap , i.e. , the sum of the mdi,deltapj in every column of table 2 divided by the number of trials performed per every deltap ( i.e. , 10 ) .
they are : md400 = 36.02 +/ - 3.91 ms ; md440 = 41.78 +/ - 10.78 ms ; md480 = 48.90 +/ - 9.91 ms. these results confirm the capability of the proposed slip detection algorithm , in terms of promptness .
the mddeltap value seems to increase proportionally to the stimulus spacing deltap , coherently with the fact that the output of the sensors shifts towards lower frequencies ( thus requiring higher latencies for being observed ) .
another crucial feature that should characterize an algorithm for the prevention of slippage events regards the correct avoidance of false positives .
while grasping an object , false positives might principally occur during the contact and / or release phases .
in figure 5 some examples of the algorithm performance are shown , extracted from one of the trials relating to the 440 microm stimulus .
a channel from each of the four groups mentioned previously is displayed in figure 5a,b ; figure 5c shows the result of the and mechanism for all the four groups , whereas figure 5d depicts the final on / off slip signal generated by means of the or operation applied onto the four ands .
in every plot , a black asterisk indicates the start of the mechatronic platform movement tst ( start of slip ) , calculated according to equation ( 9 ) .
figure 5c shows how three of the four ands result in an off signal for the entire duration of the trial .
this condition highlights the capability of the algorithm to detect the occurrence of local slip events , without requiring the activation of the whole set of channels .
this resembles the biological condition , in which the human finger tactile areas might be involved differently even when performing the same task .
the robustness of the algorithm always allowed detecting the true positive , as it is sufficient to achieve the on at least on one of the four ands .
in fact , figure 5d illustrates the on signal , which covers the whole duration of the slip event .
no false positives were detected in the example shown in figure 5 .
the same considerations can be extended to figure 6 , which relates to a trial carried out onto the 480 microm stimulus .
in figure 6 , the mems signals were taken from different channels with respect to figure 5 .
different shape can be noticed as well : this is due to the various contact conditions that every tactile array unit faces , as already referred .
most notably , channel 16 is characterized by huge peaks in correspondence of the contact and release instants , with no useful content during the slip event .
the overall success rate of the algorithm in identifying slippage events was equal to 100 % , as it correctly recognized the slippage event in all 30 trials .
false positives were rarely detected by the algorithm ; for evaluating their detection , the time lapse tfp when false positives can occur has been considered , which is the trial time t ( i.e. , 6.5 s ) decreased by the actual slippage event duration ( i.e. , 2.5 s ) .
the mean percentage of false positives , computed with respect to tfp , resulted to be : 1.01 % ( deltap = 400 microm ) , 0.11 % ( deltap = 440 microm ) , and 0.88 % ( deltap = 480 microm ) .
in order to assess relevance of the proposed method , additional tests were performed with different configurations of the filter network .
the bandwidth of the bandpass filter has been extended up to 150 hz , close to the nyquist limit ( i.e. , 190 hz ) .
the reduction of the filters quantity has been tried as well .
in this way , rising the slippage speed does not compromise the functioning of the algorithm .
moreover , the possibility to modify the design choices described in section 2 and section 3 can be demonstrated .
in figure 7 , the algorithm output is shown for a further trial ( 440 microm ) .
results depicted in figure 7a,b were obtained with a bandwidth [ 10 - 100 ] hz for the bandpass filter , while figure 7c,d offer the same graphs but relating to a bandwidth [ 10 - 150 ] hz. in both configurations , the stopband filter he2 ( z ) was removed from the filter network .
it is easy to observe that data illustrated in figure 7 do not significantly differ from the ones of figure 5 and figure 6 .
causal filters introduce an amount of delay in the system : therefore , removing one of them has the advantage of reducing the delay d between the slippage onset ( tst ) and the on signal .
e.g. , a d of 15.31 ms was achieved for the trial of figure 7 .
nevertheless , the absence of a stopband filter unavoidably results into a greater probability to detect false positives .
finally , the effectiveness of the algorithm at higher slippage velocities than the ones used in this work was proved in [ 23 ] ( up to 8 cm / s ) and [ 25 ] ( up to 4 cm / s ) .
5. conclusions and future work in this paper , a novel method for detection of slippage events was proposed .
said method was presented through a detailed description of its sub - blocks , which include simple operations such as digital filtering , rectification and envelope of the input signal .
such sub - blocks are cascaded to generate the on / off slippage identification signals .
the method was accurately validated on piezoresistive mems sensors ; an ad hoc automated setup was experimented for this purpose .
a total of four sensors , integrated into a biomimetic fingertip , were employed ; each sensor featured four channels , leading thus to sixteen channels for the slippage detection analysis .
relative movements lower than 5 mum between the sensor and the contact surface were detectable through the developed algorithm .
true positives were detected in 100 % of the cases and minimum average delays resulted lower than 50 ms. false positives have been detected in no more than 1.01 % of the cases .
remarkably , it is not necessary to employ the force value to apply the method : the raw voltages of sensor outputs ( relating to the force ) can be used as input .
in this manner the force estimation and the on / off slip signal generation can be performed as parallel operations rather than consecutive .
future works will focus on the use of additional sensors for the algorithm validation , with the aim of extending the algorithm validity beyond the piezoresistive domain .
surfaces with more naturalistic texture , in place of regular gratings , will be employed to hopefully confirm the possibility to apply the algorithm regardless the surface characteristics .
the method was already tested in a prosthetic control with common objects [ 25 ] and with surfaces whose roughness was a priori known [ 23 ] ; yet further verifications are needed in order to show the general extendibility of the algorithm .

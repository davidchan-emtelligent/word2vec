quantum spin liquids are exotic mott insulators that carry extraordinary spin excitations .
therefore , when doped , they are expected to afford metallic states with unconventional magnetic excitations .
here , we report experimental results which are suggestive of a doped spin liquid with anomalous metallicity in a triangular - lattice organic conductor .
the spin susceptibility is nearly perfectly scaled to that of a non - doped spin liquid insulator in spite of the metallic state .
furthermore , the charge transport that is confined in the layer at high temperatures becomes sharply deconfined on cooling , coinciding with the rapid growth of spin correlations or coherence as signified by a steep decrease in spin susceptibility .
the present results substantiate the desired doped spin liquid and suggest a strange metal , in which the coherence of the underlying spin liquid promotes the deconfinement of charge from the layers while preserving the non - fermi - liquid nature .
it is expected that introducing charge carriers into an exotic quantum spin liquid state may lead to an unconventional metal but there are no clear realizations of a metallic spin liquid .
here , the authors present a spin liquid candidate that also shows evidence of strange metal behavior .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction strongly interacting electrons show a variety of ground states and distinctive elementary excitations , depending on interaction strength , lattice geometry , and band filling .
in half - filled systems , the strong on - site coulomb interaction u exceeding the bandwidth w prevents electrons from doubly occupying a site , and drives the system into a mott insulating state .
although mott insulators typically exhibit magnetic order at low temperatures , spin frustration in a triangular - lattice system is theoretically expected to prevent magnetic ordering and to lead to an exotic spin state1 .
indeed , several materials with quasi - triangular lattices have been found to host spin liquids without magnetic ordering2 , 3 .
what phases emerge when carriers are injected into spin liquids by doping is an intriguing issue4 - 9 .
however , no doped spin liquids have been realized experimentally , although a doped spin liquid has been proposed as a model for high - t c superconductivity in copper oxides4 , which are not spin liquids before being doped .
a promising candidate for doped spin liquids is the organic conductor kappa - ( et ) 4hg2.89br8 ( abbreviated as kappa - hgbr ) 10 , which has conducting et layers sandwiched between insulating layers composed of hg and br ions ( fig. 1 ) .
in the conducting layers , the et dimers form a nearly isotropic triangular lattice with respect to transfer integrals between dimers as in the spin liquid insulator kappa - ( et ) 2cu2 ( cn ) 3 ( abbreviated as kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 ) ( fig. 1 ) 11 .
the spin liquid nature of kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 has been intensively studied and is revealed to contain unexpected features such as field - induced inhomogeneity and the so - called 6k - anomalies , suggesting still unknown but fertile phenomena underlying in the spin liquid state1 , 12 .
in the insulating layers , the hg ions form a sub - lattice incommensurate with the br and et sub - lattice .
this results in a fixed non - stoichiometric composition of 2.8913 , and the deficiency from 3.0 causes 11 % hole doping in the half - filled band in the conducting layer .
thus , carrier doping is created in the triangular - lattice system .
in actuality , the organic conductor kappa - hgbr is a metal .
the in - plane resistivity rho // shows non - fermi liquid ( non - fl ) behavior at low pressures , and it exhibits fermi liquid ( fl ) behavior at high pressures above 0.5 gpa14 , 15 , where an increase in carrier density is indicated by the hall coefficient , in spite of the fixed band filling15 .
thus , the kappa - hgbr is a doped mott insulator with strongly prohibited double occupancy ( or strongly bound doublon - holon pairs ) at low pressures or a correlated metal with all the electrons contributing to carriers at high pressures , analogous to the pressure - driven mott metal - insulator transition at half filling15. fig. 1 crystal structure of kappa - ( et ) 4hg2.89br8 ( denoted by kappa - hgbr ) .
a et denotes bis ( ethylenedithio ) - tetrathiafulvalene .
b shows the conducting et layer , which is parallel to the b - c plane .
the electronic bands of kappa - et compounds are well described by the tight binding of antibonding molecular orbitals in the et dimers ( indicated by broken circles ) .
the lattice of dimers is modeled as a nearly isotropic triangular lattice with a t '/ t value close to unity , where t and t ' are the transfer integrals between the antibonding orbitals of dimers forming a conduction band11 .
the non - stoichiometric composition of hg , 2.89 , originates from the incommensurability of the hg sublattice with the br and et sublattices , and is precisely known by the incommensurability determined by x - ray diffraction13 in this article , we describe the results of spin susceptibility and resistivity measurements , which probe the spin and charge sectors of the doped triangular - lattice organic conductor kappa - hgbr .
the spin susceptibility in the doped mott insulator regime is nearly perfectly scaled to that of a non - doped spin liquid insulator , indicating that the spin sector of kappa - hgbr behaves like spin liquid in spite of the metallic state .
the non - femi liquid nature of the charge sector is confirmed by the temperature - linear resistivity .
furthermore , a sharp non - metal - to - metal crossover in the out - of - plane resistivity coincides with a drop - off in spin susceptibility , indicating entanglement between spin correlations and interlayer charge coherence .
the present results suggest the realization of a doped spin liquid that hosts a non - fermi liquid in a triangular - lattice organic conductor .
results spin susceptibility to assess the spin liquid nature of kappa - hgbr in the doped mott insulator regime , we measured the spin susceptibility chi spin ( fig. 2a ) .
it is characterized by a linear temperature dependence at high temperatures and a rounded peak at 30 - 40 k , followed by a sharp decrease , which is consistent with earlier reports16 , 17 .
the behavior of the chi spin differs considerably from that of isostructural metallic compounds with half - filled bands , kappa - ( et ) 2x ( x = cu ( ncs ) 2 and cu [ n ( cn ) 2 ] br ) , which reside close to the antiferromagnetic ground state .
they show only weakly temperature - dependent pauli - paramagnetic susceptibility on the order of 4 x 10 - 4 emu mol - 1 at most ( fig. 2a ) 18 , which is less than half of the peak value ( 9 x 10 - 4 emu mol - 1 ) found in kappa - hgbr .
instead , the chi spin of the kappa - hgbr is well reproduced by a series expansion of the triangular - lattice heisenberg model , which is applicable down to t ~ 0.2 j or lower19 with a nearest - neighbor exchange interaction , j , of 140 k ( fig. 2a ) .
the chi spin of the quantum spin - liquid mott - insulator kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 is also known to comply with that of the triangular - lattice heisenberg model with a j of 250 k1 .
the differences in the j values are reasonably explained by the differences in u and t between kappa - hgbr and kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 ( see methods ) .
to compare the chi spin of the two systems , we examined the scaling of jchi spin against t / j 20 .
remarkably , the two results are indistinguishable , and it is noted that there is no adjustable parameter ( fig. 2b ) .
only a slight difference in the temperature range below 0.1 j is recognizable ( supplementary fig. 1 ) .
the nearly perfect coincidence clearly shows that in the spin sector , kappa - hgbr behaves nearly exactly like the spin liquid insulator , kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 , with the exception of the difference in j , while they behave quite differently in the charge sector ( inset of fig. 2b ) .
this is a clear indication of spin - charge separation .
a prominent feature in the scaled susceptibility is a sharp decrease at low temperatures , for example , below 0.1 j , which is beyond the temperature range of the series expansion .
considering that there is no magnetic ordering in these systems2 , 21 , the sharp decrease in the susceptibility is not a simple indication of the growth of the 120degrees spin correlation , which would end up with a long - range order in the heisenberg model .
instead , the sharp decrease signifies the increasing correlation or coherence inherent in the spin liquid .
interestingly , nmr relaxation rate shows an accelerated decrease with temperature around 10 k in both systems2 , 17 , which may indicate the crossover from the 120degrees short range order to quantum spin liquid .
thus , the present result provides the first direct indication of the spin liquid nature of a metallic phase revealed by magnetic measurements. fig. 2 evidence for a doped spin liquid .

the broken lines represent the numerical curves obtained by the series expansion of the triangular - lattice heisenberg model with a pade approximant of order [ 7 / 7 ] 19 .
comparing the calculations and the experimental data yields a j value of 130 - 150 k. b scaled chi spin of kappa - hgbr and kappa - ( et ) 2cu2 ( cn ) 3 ( denoted by kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 ) 2 .
jchi spin is plotted against t / j , where chi spin is defined per mole of spin and j is in unit of k b. the inset shows the in - plane resistivity of the two compounds out - of - plane resistivity having justified that kappa - hgbr hosts a doped spin liquid , we proceeded to further characterize the non - fl state using out - of - plane transport , which probes the nature of the conducting state through the inter - layer tunneling of charge carriers to address the issue of charge excitations in the metallic state22 .
figure 3a shows the rho _|_ of the kappa - hgbr with the tuning pressure across the non - fl - to - fl transition / crossover point .
at 0.1 and 0.15 gpa , the temperature dependence of the out - of - plane resistivity rho _|_ is non - metallic in a wide temperature range , where rho // behaves like a metal ( fig. 3b ) .
a peak is reached in the rho _|_ at ~ 20 k , followed by a steep decrease .
above 0.2 gpa , the peak in rho _|_ with respect to temperature is broadened and shifted towards higher temperatures .
at pressures above 0.5 gpa , the temperature dependence of rho _|_ is metallic over a wide temperature range. fig. 3 out - of - plane and in - plane resistivities of kappa - ( et ) 4hg2.89br8 .
a , b temperature dependences of out - of - plane resistivity rho _|_ ( a ) and in - plane resistivity rho // ( b ) at several pressures .
at ambient pressure , this material shows a number of spurious jumps in resistivity with temperature variation , very probably due to micro - cracking in the crystal , as encountered in several organic materials .
thus , applying finite pressures was necessary for obtaining reliable data to characterize the out - of - plane metallicity , we plotted the rate of change in rho _|_ with respect to temperature , 1 / rho _|_( drho _|_/ dt ) .
as the pressure decreases , the interlayer metallicity begins to decrease at ~ 0.5 gpa for all temperatures except below 20 k ( fig. 4a ) .
the contour plot of 1 / rho _|_( drho _|_/ dt ) highlights how the interlayer - metallic region extends to higher temperatures for higher pressures ( fig. 4b ) .
there are three distinctive regions ; p < 0.3 gpa , 0.3 < p < 0.6 gpa and p > 0.6 gpa .
the high - pressure region ( p > 0.6 gpa ) corresponds to the fl region identified by the behavior of rho // , which exhibits quadratic temperature dependence roughly in the blue - colored region ( fig. 4c ) 15 .
in p < 0.3 gpa , the peculiar nonmetal - to - metal crossover sharply occurs only in the out - of - plane direction at low temperatures , 10 - 15 k ( fig. 3a ) in the non - fl regime , where temperature - linear dependence of rho // is observed ( fig. 4c ) 14 , 15 .
the intermediate region ( 0.3 < p < 0.6 gpa ) is a transition region between the two regimes. fig. 4 pressure dependence of charge excitations .

the solid line represents the superconducting transition temperatures determined by ac susceptibility measurements15 .
c pressure dependence of power law behavior of rho // .
the power n is determined by fitting the form of rho // = rho omicron + at n to the data of rho // in a temperature range between superconducting transition temperature and 15 k ( see methods and supplementary fig. 3 ) to examine the possible involvement of superconducting fluctuations in the nonmetal - to - metal crossover in p < 0.3 gpa , we measured rho // and rho _|_ under magnetic fields perpendicular to the layers ( fig. 5 ) .
above the superconducting transition temperature t c , both rho // and rho _|_ are not affected by the magnetic fields that are large enough to extinguish the superconductivity .
this rules out the role of superconductivity in the low - temperature restoration of the interlayer coupling .
it is remarkable that the non - fl nature persists down to the lowest temperature studied , 1.8 k , when the superconductivity disappears .
this observation is contrary to the fl behaviors of non - doped systems in the vicinity of the mott transition23. fig. 5 magnetic field dependence of resistivity .
a , b out - of - plane resistivity rho _|_ ( a ) and in - plane resistivity rho // ( b ) under magnetic fields of 0 , 3 , 6 and 9t applied perpendicular to the conducting plane at a pressure of 0.3 gpa discussion a clue to the puzzling interlayer transport at low pressures is found in the steep decrease of chi spin , which occurs in the same temperature range ( below 0.1 j ) as the nonmetal - to - metal crossover in the rho _|_ , indicating the recoupling of charge and spin .
fermionic spinon excitations have been proposed as a model of spin liquids24 , which have finite chi spin values at low - temperatures as in the present system ( supplementary fig. 1 ) .
in this context , the coincidence of the transport and magnetic anomalies suggests that the interlayer transport of doped carriers is enhanced by the formation of coherent spinons .
it is noted , however , that the spin - charge coupling is weak because the non - fermi - liquid nature persists even after the nonmetal - to - metal crossover in rho _|_ occurs .
if the spinons and doped carriers were strongly coupled , conventional quasi - particles would result , leading to a fermi liquid with large fermi surfaces at low temperatures .
the absence of large fermi surfaces is supported by the hall coefficient , which indicates a considerable decrease in the carrier density at low pressures15 .
thus , we suggest that an extraordinary quantum fluid in which spin and charge are weakly coupled emerges in a doped spin liquid , whereas spin and charges are separated in the high temperature range .
a slight difference between the susceptibilities of the undoped and doped systems at temperatures below 0.1 j ( supplementary fig. 1 ) could be a signature of the weak spin - charge coupling .
the peculiarity of the doped spin liquid also appears in the electronic specific heat coefficient , gamma = 55 mj mol - 1 k - 2 , which is extraordinarily large among organic conductors ; e.g. , gamma = 25 and 22 mj mol - 1 k - 2 for the half - filled metals , kappa - ( et ) 2x with x = cu ( ncs ) 2 and cu [ n ( cn ) 2 ] br , respectively25 .
the wilson ratio given by ( pi2 / 3 )( chi spin / mub 2 )/( gamma / kb 2 ) for kappa - hgbr is 0.63 , an anomalous value that considerably deviates from the values for the half - filled systems , 0.95 and 0.98 , respectively , typical values for fermi liquids26 , 27 .
on the other hand , in the spin liquid system kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 , the gamma value of 13 mj mol - 1 k - 2 is discussed as a hallmark of the spinon fermi surfaces in conjunction with the acceptable wilson ratio , 1.6 , as fermionic excitations .
notably , another spin liquid insulator , me3etsb [ pd ( dmit ) 2 ] , also shows nearly the same wilson ratio .
assuming this value for the spin sector in kappa - hgbr , gamma becomes 22 mj mol - 1 k - 2 , which explains only a fraction of the observed gamma value .
given that spin and charge are only weakly coupled with each other , we ascribe the remaining large value , 33 mj mol - 1 k - 2 , to the charge channel opened by 11 % doped holes with the non - fermi liquid nature .
an anomalous metal with a preserved spin - liquid nature , as observed here is theoretically suggested for multi - band systems with conduction electrons and localized spins on geometrically frustrated lattices28 - 31 such as the shastry - sutherland lattice32 , 33 and pyrochlore lattices34 .
in the weak kondo coupling regime , electrons in the conduction band become only weakly hybridized with the frustrated spins in a spin liquid state31 .
the predictions include the following similarities to the present observations in the single - band kappa - hgbr system .
first is that the anomalous metal emerges upon cooling from a situation in which the conducting and magnetic channels appear disentangled at high temperatures .
second is that the anomalous metal turns into a conventional fl , when the transfer integral in our system or the kondo coupling in the multiband model is increased35 .
in this scenario , the non - fl - to - fl crossover at 0.5 gpa can be an indication of the strong spin - charge coupling leading to quasiparticle formation .
addressing the present issue may require reconciling the predictions for the multiband model with the present observations in the single - band system .
seeking qualitatively different metallic phases from the fermi liquid is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics .
the present results indicate that a doped spin - liquid is realized in a real material , and it is a non - fermi liquid in the charge sector and a spin - liquid in the spin sector , where the two sectors are weakly coupled to each other .
notably , superconductivity emerges in this system .
what kind of cooper pairing occurs in this strange metal is an issue of future work .
methods band calculations in the present study , we used the band parameters based on the extended huckel method and tight - binding approximations with the dimer model .
the lattice parameters used in the calculations are reported in refs .
36 , 37 .
the t '/ t values38 - 41 and the predicted ground states42 - 49 are known to depend on the theoretical methods employed ; however , the fact that the same ( quantum chemical ) method gives nearly the same t '/ t values , 1.02 for kappa - hgbr and 1.06 for kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 , suggests the similar degrees of spin frustration in the two materials .
the difference in j between kappa - hgbr and kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 is reasonably explained by differences in u and t , where u is defined for a dimer of bedt - ttf molecules and is estimated by 2t dimer with t dimer the intra - dimer transfer integral in the limit of strong correlation on a et molecule .
in case that u is sufficiently larger than t , j is approximately given by 4t 2 / u , which yields 18.4 mev ( 210 k ) for kappa - hgbr and 26.8 mev ( 310 k ) for kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 according to the band - structure calculations .
these estimates qualitatively explain the magnitudes and material dependence of the j values obtained by fitting the heisenberg model to the experimental data ; j = 140 k for kappa - hgbr and 250 k for kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 .
crystal growth and transport and susceptibility measurements the single crystals of kappa - hgbr and kappa - cu2 ( cn ) 3 used in the present study were grown by the conventional electrochemical methods .
the magnetic susceptibility was measured using a squid magnetometer ( quantum design mpms xl - 7 ) .
the spin susceptibility was obtained by subtracting the core - diamagnetic contribution from the measured susceptibility .
we confirmed that chi spin is nearly sample - independent in the normal state above 3 k ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
the in - plane and out - of - plane resistivities were measured by the conventional four - probe method using a source meter ( keithley 2400 ) and a nanovolt meter ( keithley 2182a ) .
pressure was applied with the use of a dual structured clamp - type cell formed by becu and nicral cylinders .
daphne7373 oil , which does not solidify up to 2.2 gpa at room temperature , was used as a pressure - transmitting medium .
the values of pressure reported here is the internal pressure at low temperatures , which is lower than the external pressure at room temperature due to solidification of the pressure medium and friction in the pressure cell .
power - law analysis of in - plane resistivity to characterise the power law behavior of rho // at low temperatures , the resistivity data presented in fig. 3b are fitted by the form of rho // = rho omicron + at n in a temperature range between the superconducting transition temperature and 15 k. as shown in supplementary fig. 3 , the fitting works well for 0.57 , 0.85 , and 1.57 gpa , and the pressure dependence of power n is consistent with the previous studies14 , 15 in that the value of n changes from 1 to 2 under pressure .
concerning the data fitting for 0.19 and 0.38 gpa , rho omicron takes negative values , which are unphysical , and thus the n values deduced are considered not to be reliable .
to obtain reliable n value in this low pressure range , we need resistivity data at lower temperatures with superconductivity suppressed by magnetic field .
figure 5b shows resistivity data at 0.3 gpa under a magnetic field of 9 t , which allow a physically valid power - law fitting , as shown in supplementary fig. 3f .

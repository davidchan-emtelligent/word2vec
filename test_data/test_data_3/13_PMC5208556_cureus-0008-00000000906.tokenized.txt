introduction mixed connective tissue disease ( mctd ) was initially described as a unique syndrome with features of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , systemic sclerosis , and myositis associated with antibodies to a nuclear ribonucleoprotein , u1 ribonucleoprotein ( rnp ) .
subsequently , the serological specificity was defined to epitopes on the 70 kd phosphoprotein uniquely associated with the ribonucleoprotein particle containing u1 rnp [ 1 ] .
the original claims for mctd have subsequently become points of contention .
these include the clinical distinctiveness based on the presence of a particular group of features , notably raynaud 's phenomenon , polyarthritis , " puffy " hands , oesophageal dysmotility , myositis and lymphadenopathy in the absence of cerebral and renal disease or vasculitis , a benign prognosis , responsiveness to corticosteroids , and the presence of high titres of anti - u1 rnp [ 2 ] .
case presentation a 24 - year - old female with a history of asthma and gerd presented to the emergency room with severe chest pain , chest tightness and shortness of breath following an upper respiratory tract infection .
the patient reported episodes of dry cough and runny nose one week prior to this presentation , followed by a sudden sharp pain in the center of the chest .
the pain was 8 / 10 in intensity on the visual analog scale and pleuritic in nature , which aggravated by deep breathing and lying down flat .
it was relieved by sitting up straight and did not radiate to her left arm or jaw .
the patient has associated cough and high - grade fever but denied chills , wheezing , orthopnea , nausea or vomiting .
she had not experienced similar complaints in the past .
the patient also complained of muscle aches along the back of her neck and shoulders .
she denied smoking or alcohol use .
physical examination revealed a healthy looking african american female .
auscultation of the chest and back demonstrated slightly diminished breath sounds at the bilateral lung bases .
no murmurs or friction rubs were appreciated on precordial examination .
vital signs were recorded , monitored and charted .
initially , the heart rate was 105 / min but later decreased to 94 / min , temperature upon arrival to the emergency department was 103.3 degreesf and after treatment , it improved to 98.4 degreesf , oxygen ( o2 ) saturation was 99 % on room air and respiratory rate was 18 / min .
laboratory investigations showed low serum sodium levels suggesting hyponatremia secondary to hypovolemic state , high aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) and alanine transaminase ( alt ) levels , possibly due to an underlying infection ( table 1 ) .
the patient was anemic but white blood cell count was elevated at 10.6 k / mm3 .
acute - phase reactants such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate , c - reactive protein , and ferritin levels were high .
creatine kinase ( ck ) was markedly elevated with a low ck - mb relative index indicative of skeletal muscle injury .
mild increase in troponin levels was suggestive of pericardial inflammation .
positive antinuclear antibodies ( ana ) and elevated levels of anti - dsdna , anti - rnp , anti - smith and anti - ssa / b antibodies consistent with a mixed picture of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , sjogren 's syndrome and polymyositis were found .

ct angiography of the chest was also performed .
axial contrast enhanced images using 100 ml isovue 370 intravenous contrast material with multiplanar reformations showed mild left pleural effusion as well as a small pericardial effusion with bilateral lower lobe interstitial infiltrates .
there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism .
electrocardiogram ( ecg ) showed no apparent st segment elevation or depression ( figure 3 ) .
echocardiogram showed small pericardial effusion , no diastolic chamber collapse , ejection fraction of 65 - 70 % , normal left ventricular diastolic function , normal left ventricular internal dimensions and wall thickness .

no infiltrates are seen on the right side figure 3 ekg showing non - specific t wave abnormality in the emergency department , she was diagnosed with pericarditis based on history , but imaging of the chest showed diffuse infiltrates in the lungs indicating multifocal community acquired pneumonia for which she was treated with 250 mg zithromax ( azithromycin ) po daily , 1 g rocephin ( ceftriaxone ) iv twice a day and 2 litres of intravenous ( iv ) fluid .
the patient received dilaudid ( hydromorphone ) and toradol ( non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug ) for her chest pain and possible pericarditis .
she was also managed with scheduled ibuprofen 600 mg every eight hours for generalized body aches , colchicine for polyserositis , and pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate ( proton pump inhibitor ) 20 mg po daily for gerd .
she responded well to the medications .
the patient was prescribed prednisone on a tapering dose .
on the follow - up visit , her condition significantly improved although her creatinine phosphokinase levels remained elevated suggesting rhabdomyolysis and polymyositis .
informed consent was obtained from the patient for this study .
discussion the universal definition of mixed connective tissue disease ( mctd ) and its classification criteria are not established .
some experts describe mctd as a syndrome with overlapping features of various connective tissue diseases ( ctds ) .
multiple case series and cohorts have described mctd as a complex disease with variable clinical presentation [ 3 - 4 ] .
the peak incidence of the disease occurs in the third decade of life and may affect people in all age groups .
the annual incidence of mctd in the united states is reported to be 1.9 per million , with a female predominance [ 5 ] .
the diagnosis of mctd can be challenging because of overlapping symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , systemic sclerosis ( ssc ) and polymyositis / dermatomyositis ( pm / dm ) .
the most common clinical features of mctd reported are raynaud 's phenomenon and ' puffy hands ' .
the cumulative frequency of these features is more than 90 % in mctd .
various diagnostic criteria have been established to aid in the diagnosis of mctd .
diagnosis of mctd should be considered in the presence of anti - rnp antibodies along with raynaud 's phenomenon and swollen hands , along with the presence of ( two or more ) arthritis , pericarditis , myositis , interstitial lung disease ( ild ) or esophageal dysmotility .
in this case report , the diagnostic challenge of variable symptom presentation and overlapping immunological workup suggested the involvement of multiple ctds .
the commonly used coexisting clinical criteria for the diagnosis of mctd are the alarcon - segovia criteria and the kasukawa criteria [ 6 - 7 ] .
a major criterion included in the diagnostic set is myositis , with prevalence ranging 35 - 79 % in patients with mctd .
it is rarely a presenting symptom and develops slowly over the course of the disease with a similar distribution pattern as in pm / dm associated muscle injury [ 8 ] .
joint pain ( polyarthritis ) is another major symptom listed in the criteria set and is commonly associated with mctd .
lung manifestations in mctd include interstitial lung disease ( ild ) and pulmonary hypertension ( pah ) , with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia ( nisp ) being the most commonly observed histological pattern of ild [ 9 ] .
nisp presents as ground glass opacities and reticular pattern on high - resolution computed tomography ( hrct ) .
patients with lung involvement have lower pulmonary function test values .
gastrointestinal ( gi ) involvement includes esophageal dysmotility and hypomotility , which are also part of kasukawa criteria set only .
gastroesophageal reflux disease is common and may increase the risk of aspiration syndromes .
pleural thickening or effusion occurs in less than 10 % of patients .
skin involvement is included in the kasukawa criteria set .
studies report a cumulative frequency of 36 - 53 % of skin manifestations over the course of the disease , including photosensitivity , malar rash , telangiectasia , or hypo - and hyper - pigmentation .
also , 20 % of patients with mctd develop renal abnormalities , most commonly immune complex depositions ( membranous glomerular nephropathy ) ; however , this is not a part of the diagnostic criteria sets .
in this case report , the diagnostic features were variable and did not meet a particular criteria set .
our patient had a combination of gastroesophageal reflux disease , pericarditis , serositis ( pleural effusion ) and myositis , which along with the positive immunological workup was suggestive of mctd .
the autoimmune workup was positive for ana , anti - dsdna , anti - sm and anti - ssa / b ; however , the presence of anti - rnp was most suggestive of mctd .
conclusions when overlapping features of the autoimmune disease are present , mctd should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis .
prognosis of such patients depends on earlier diagnosis and treatment with steroids to prevent further progression .
the authors have declared that no competing interests exist .

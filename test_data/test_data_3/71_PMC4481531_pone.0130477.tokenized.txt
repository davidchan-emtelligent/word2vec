aims activation of ca2 +/ calmodulin protein kinase ii ( camkii ) is an important step in signaling of cardiac hypertrophy .
the molecular mechanisms by which camkii integrates with other pathways in the heart are incompletely understood .
we hypothesize that camkii association with extracellular regulated kinase ( erk ) , promotes cardiac hypertrophy through erk nuclear localization .
methods and results in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts , the selective camkii peptide inhibitor antcantide , its penetratin conjugated minimal inhibitory sequence analog tat - cn17beta , and the mek / erk inhibitor uo126 all reduce phenylephrine ( pe ) - mediated erk and camkii activation and their interaction .
moreover , antcantide or tat - cn17beta pretreatment prevented pe induced camkii and erk nuclear accumulation in h9c2s and reduced the hypertrophy responses .
to determine the role of camkii in cardiac hypertrophy in vivo , spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to intramyocardial injections of antcantide or tat - cn17beta .
left ventricular hypertrophy was evaluated weekly for 3 weeks by cardiac ultrasounds .
we observed that the treatment with camkii inhibitors induced similar but significant reduction of cardiac size , left ventricular mass , and thickness of cardiac wall .
the treatment with camkii inhibitors caused a significant reduction of camkii and erk phosphorylation levels and their nuclear localization in the heart .
conclusion these results indicate that camkii and erk interact to promote activation in hypertrophy ; the inhibition of camkii - erk interaction offers a novel therapeutic approach to limit cardiac hypertrophy .

introduction calcium / calmodulin dependent kinase ii ( camkii ) belongs to the subfamily of multifunctional ser / thr kinases , that phosphorylate a variety of substrates and regulate numerous cellular functions [ 1 - 4 ] that are intimately involved in heart diseases [ 5 - 7 ] .
the pathogenetic role of camkii in cardiac disorders is confirmed by the up regulation of this kinase in human and animal models of cardiac remodelling and heart failure , [ 8 - 11 ] .
several studies have demonstrated that camkii plays important functions in the development of cardiac hypertrophy by activating the impaired gene expression of atrial natriuretic peptide ( anp ) , brain natriuretic peptide ( bnp ) , beta - myosin heavy chain ( beta - mhc ) , and skeletal actin [ 12 ] .
on the other hand , extracellular signal regulated kinase ( erk ) also represent a critical regulator of hypertrophic responses through the phosphorylation of transcription factors and the induction of the expression of hypertrophy - related genes [ 13 ] .
thus , activation of the fetal gene program that involves camkii and erk may be regarded as the earliest and most prominent marker of left ventricular hypertrophy ( lvh ) [ 14 ] .
connections between ca2 + signaling and the erk pathway have been documented in many cell systems [ 15 ] .
moreover , we have recently showed that the crosstalk between camkii and erk pathways and their physical interaction regulate the alpha1 adrenergic receptors ( alpha1ar ) - mediated proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells ( vsmc ) , through their association and we have suggested a model in which camkii regulates the ca2 + - dependent assembly of the erk cascade components , and the subcellular localization of both camkii and erk [ 16 ] .
however , the existence of a mechanistic correlation between the activation of the camkii - erk pathway and the development of cardiac hypertrophy has never been studied .
the implication of camkii as a possible mechanism of cardiac disease fosters the search of pharmacological tools to target the kinase in the heart , in order to inhibit maladaptive responses [ 5 , 17 - 19 ] .
chemical compounds that possess inhibitory properties on camkii are available , including the widely used kn93 , which targets the atp pocket of camks [ 20 ] .
the poor selectivity of this compound is its major limiting factor for translating the use in clinical setups , due to the elevated risk of undesired effects [ 21 , 22 ] .
the mechanism of inhibition of camkii with specific peptides represents an alternative strategy to achieve a selective inhibition of the kinase , based on the sterical inhibition of the conformational change of the kinase needed for its activation [ 23 , 24 ] , rather than with the occupation of the atp pocket , as for kn93 [ 21 ] .
a selective peptide inhibitor for camkii was derived from the sequence of a natural camkii specific protein inhibitor selective to camkii , cam - kiin [ 25 ] , which includes a 27 - aminoacid sequence ( cam - kntide : krppklgqigrskrvvieddriddvlk ) [ 26 ] conjugated with antennapedia n - terminal domain ( krppklgqigrskrvvied ) ( antcantide ) , blocks camkii - dependent phenotypes in vitro [ 16 , 22 , 27 , 28 ] .
compared to other pharmacological inhibitors , this peptide has the advantage of camkii selectivity over other kinases of the family [ 26 - 28 ] .
recently , we identified the antcantide minimal inhibitory sequence that sits in residues 1 - 17 ( cn17beta krppklgqigrakrvvi )( 27 ) .
this novel cn17beta peptide recapitulates the inhibitory properties of the parental antcantide peptide .
to improve its ability to enter cells , cn17beta has been fused with penetrating peptide tat ( rkkrrqrrrppqc ) .
the resulting peptide tat - cn17beta retains the inhibitory activity and selectivity for camkii [ 27 ] .
so far there is no evidence of its effectiveness in reducing cardiac myocyte hypertrophy [ 29 ] .
in this setting also , the use of camkii inhibitors can help to understand the molecular elements of the camkii - erk interaction and their functional significance , with the perspective of a novel therapeutic approach to limit pathological cardiac hypertrophy .
the aim of this study is therefore to demonstrate in cellular and animal models that the use of camkii peptide inhibitors ( antcantide and tat - cn17beta ) is effective to reduce hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes and remodeling of the heart , and identify the mechanism of the crosstalk between the erk and camkii pathways in the hypertrophy phenotype .
materials and methods in vitro study cell culture cardiomyoblasts h9c2 were purchased from atcc ( crl - 1446 ) and cultured in dulbecco 's minimal essential medium ( dmem , gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs , gibco ) 200 mg / ml l - glutamine , 100 units / ml penicillin , and 10 mg / ml streptomycin ( sigma - aldrich mo. ) , at 37degreesc in 0.95 g / l air - 0.05 g / l co2 .
h9c2 cells were studied between passages 4 and 10 .
to examine the role of camkii on cardiac hypertrophy we studied the responses to alpha1ar stimulation , with phenylephrine ( pe ) .
h9c2 cells were incubated overnight in dmem serum - free ( fbs 1 %) and then exposed to pe ( 100 nmol / l , sigma aldrigh mo. ) at different time points .
to investigate the effect of camkii inhibition on pe - mediated erk activation , we pretreated h9c2 for 30 min. with the camks inhibitor kn93 ( 5 mumol / l , methossibenensulphonamide , purchased from seikagaku ) ; alternatively we used of the selective camkii inhibitors antcantide ( 10 mumol / l ) [ 16 , 25 , 28 ] and tat - cn17beta ( 5 mumol / l ) [ 27 ] .
antcantide and tat - cn17beta peptides were synthesized and purified at the department of pharmacy of salerno as previously described and validated [ 27 ] .
the penetrating peptide tat : rkkrrqrrrppqc ( 5 mumol / l ) was also used as a control in preliminary experiments in which showed no inhibitory activity ( data not shown ) .
in order to study the effect of erk inhibition on pe - mediated camkii activation , we pre - treated h9c2s for 30 min. with the map kinase inhibitor uo126 ( promega , wi. 10 mumol / l ) [ 16 ] .
finally , in another set of experiments , to evaluate the effects of protein kinase a ( pka ) on pe induced camkii / erk interaction , we transfected h9c2s with a plasmid encoding pka inhibitor single - point mutant gene ( pka - i ) , a kind gift of prof. antonio feliciello ( federico ii university of naples ) [ 30 , 31 ] .
cell infection and transfection the catalytically inactive form ( rcamkiialpha , k42m , impaired atp binding pocket , ( camkii dn )) and the wild type ( camkii - wt , rcamkiialpha ) variant of camkii were subcloned into psp72 ( promega ) .
adenoviruses encoding camkii catalytically inactive ( camkii - dn ) and wild type ( camkii - wt ) were generated using the adeasy system ( quantum biotechnologies ) [ 32 - 34 ] .
h9c2 cells at =~ 70 % confluence were incubated 1 h at 37degreesc with 5 ml dmem containing purified adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 100:1 , encoding either the camkii - dn , camkii - wt variants i or the empty virus as a negative control ( ctr ) [ 16 ] .
24 h after the infection , the cells were used for the experiments .
transient transfection of the pka - i plasmid was performed using lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen ) in 70 % confluent h9c2s .
western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis to examine the effect of camkii inhibition on cardiac hypertrophy , h9c2 cardiomioblasts were stimulated with the alpha1ar agonist , pe ( 100 nmol / l ) after pretreatment with camks inhibitor kn93 ( 5 mumol / l seikagaku , tokyo , japan ) and camkii selective inhibitors , antcantide ( 10 mumol / l ) or tat - cn17beta ( 5 mumol / l ) for 30 min .

camkii isoforms in cardiac myocytes in order to verify the similarity between cultured cardiac myoblast and adult cardiac myocytes , we tested the expression of camkii isoforms in h9c2 , a cell line of cardiac myoblasts , and ventricular adult myocytes from wky rats .
h9c2 cells express camkii alpha , beta and gamma isoforms , similar to adult ventricular myocytes .

next , we evaluated the intracellular localization of erk and camkii to study whether camkii inhibition affects the subcellular compartmentalization of one or both kinases .
pe stimulation induces both camkii and erk nuclear accumulation ; kn93 , antcantide and tat - cn17beta prevent pe induced nuclear localization of both kinases ( fig 2e and 2f ) .
previously , we showed in vsmc cells that the interaction between camkii and erk resulted in a significant increase of autonomous camkii activity and we demonstrated that erk activity is required to interact with and activate camkii ( 16 ) .
interestingly , the inhibition of erk by uo126 in turn reduces camk2 phosphorylation also in cardiomyoblasts ( fig 3a and 3b ) , inhibits the interaction of both camkii and erk ( fig 3c and 3d ) , as well as pe - induced nuclear localization of erk and camkii ( fig 3e and 3f ) .
it is possible to speculate that the effect of pe is mediated by a non - selective activation of the betaadrenergic receptor and consequent pka activity .
to rule out this hypothesis , we transfected h9c2 with the pka - i plasmid to inhibit pka and verified under these conditions pe induced camkii / erk interaction induced by pe. pka - i did not impair pe - induced camkii or erk phosphorylation ( fig 4a and 4b ) nor did we observe inhibition of pe mediated camkii / erk interaction ( fig 4c and 4d ) or pe - induced nuclear localization of either kinases ( fig 4e and 4f ) .
altogether , our results demonstrate camkii - dependent erk activation after pe stimulation and support the concept that erk and camkii transactivate reciprocally .

3. camkii - dependent regulation of the hypertrophy marker atrial natriuretic factor the atrial natriuretic peptide ( anp ) is an established marker of cardiac hypertrophy , and pe a widely recognized inducer of cardiac hypertrophy [ 45 ] , causes anp expression in h9c2 cells .
to demonstrate the role of camkii in cardiac hypertrophy , h9c2 cardiomioblasts were incubated with adenoviral constructs encoding camkii catalytically inactive ( camkii - dn ) , camkii wild - type ( camkii - wt ) or the empty virus as a negative control and then stimulated with pe for 24 h to assess anp expression levels .
the overexpression of camkii - wt determines an increase of the expression levels of anp both in basal conditions and after stimulation with pe compared to controls .
on the other hand , camkii - dn infection significantly reduces anp levels ( fig 5a ) .
to confirm the expression of camkii - wt and camkii - dn after infection in h9c2s , the total cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis for camkii ( fig 5b ) .
finally , the efficacy of camkii inhibitors to prevent pe induced hypertrophic responses in h9c2s , is confirmed by the use of kn93 , antcantide and tat - cn17beta , which all significantly reduced the levels of anp expression induced by pe ( fig 5c ) .
a similar result is obtained by the inhibition of erk pathway with uo126 ( fig 5c ) .
these data are consistent with the crosstalk between camkii and erk pathways , and suggest the existence of a correlation between the activation of camkii - erk pathway and anp activation .

4. camkii selective inhibition with specific peptides blocks cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats to transpose in in vivo model the effect of camkii inhibition , we used shr , an animal model of hypertension - induced left ventricular hypertrophy ( lvh ) .
antcantide , tat - cn17beta or a saline solution were injected in the cardiac wall of the shrs at a time point when lvh develops .
lvh was evaluated weekly for 3 weeks by echocardiography .
both antcantide and tat - cn17beta treatments efficiently reduced cardiac wall thickness ( fig 6a ) and lvm ( fig 6b ) .
accordingly , at the end of the observation period , the heart weight ( hw ) to the body weight ratio showed a significant reduction ( fig 6c ) .
a similar beneficial effect could be observed on left ventricle function , assessed by ultrasound analysis .
indeed , compared to normotensive wky rats , lv ejection fraction ( lvef ) and lv fractional shortening ( lvfs ) , were depressed in the shr control group ( fig 6d ) .
the treatment with either antcantide or tat - cn17beta tends to improve these parameters without however reaching statistical significance ( fig 6d ) .
to rule out changes in hemodynamics as a possible mechanism of regulation of lvh , we measured blood pressure in rats after the treatment and verified that there were no significant effects on this parameter ( fig 6e ) .
biochemical analysis confirmed the reduction of lvh related biochemical responses induced by antcantide and tat - cn17beta , as assessed by the expression of the hypertrophy marker gene anp ( fig 6f ) .
because increased cell size and augmented interstitial fibrosis are key processes in the progression of pathological cardiac remodeling , we performed masson trichrome staining to assess the effects of antcantide and tat - cn17beta treatment on shr hearts .
intramyocardial injection of both camkii inhibitors significantly attenuated the amount of fibrosis such as cardiomyocytes size when compared with shr controls .

results are expressed as mean +/ - sem from 3 independent experiments .
the ratio of fold change was calculated using the pfaffl method [ 36 ] .
histological analysis of shr hearts showed common elements of hypertension - induced lvh , including increased cell size and augmented interstitial fibrosis compared to wky ( fig 7a ) .
the improvement of both parameters was confirmed by digital measurements ( fig 7b and 7c ) .
to further confirm that the treatment with camkii selective inhibitors reduced interstitial fibrosis of shr hearts , we evaluated the collagen expression .
the quantitative real - time pcr demonstrated that the transcript levels of both collagen i and collagen iii were significantly lower in shr hearts treated with with antcantide or tat - cn17beta when compared to shr controls ( fig 7d ) .

5. the selective inhibition of camkii regulates camkii / erk subcellular localization in left ventricles of spontaneously hypertensive rats to confirm the role of the cross talk between camkii and erk in cardiac hypertrophy , we evaluated camkii and erk phosphorylation and subcellular localization in left ventricles .
we observed that camkii expression levels were increased regardless of treatment in shr compared to wky ( fig 8a ) .
importantly , camkii phosphorylation levels were enhanced , and this effect was prevented by antcantide and tat - cn17beta ( fig 8b ) .
as expected , increased levels of erk phosphorylation were observed in sham treated shr left ventricles .
once again treatment with camkii selective inhibitors markedly reduced erk1 / 2 phosphorylation levels ( fig 8c ) .
in the hypertrophic hearts , the nuclear accumulation of camkii and erk was also enhanced ( fig 8d and 8e ) , as well as the interaction between both kinases ( fig 8f ) .
strikingly , camkii inhibition by antcantide or tat - cn17beta blocked both erk1 / 2 phosphorylation ( fig 8c ) and camkii / erk interaction ( fig 8f ) .
these inhibitory events were mirrored by the reduction of the nuclear content of both kinases ( fig 8d and 8e ) .
these data indicate that camkii inhibitors , antcantide and tat - cn17beta , are both able to reduce hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes and remodeling of the heart , by a mechanism that involves the crosstalk between the erk and camkii pathways and their nuclear accumulation .

data from all immunoblots presented here were quantified by densitometric analysis .
each data point in all graphs represent the mean +/ - sem of 3 independent experiments .
discussion in the present study , we provide for the first time the compelling evidence that pharmacological selective inhibition of camkii results in the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo models .
indeed , so far the role of camkii in lvh was essentially demonstrated by gene deletion strategies ( 5 ) .
here we demonstrate that peptides designed on the camtide sequence can inhibit camkii and block hypertrophy responses .
furthermore , our data indicate that a crosstalk between camkii and erk also occurs in cardiac myocytes and promotes cardiac hypertrophy .
our data exploit the pathogenic role of camkii in the settings of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy , showing that a targeting strategy based on selective peptides can prevent this maladaptive response of the heart .
since camkii is present in humans in 4 isoforms , namely camkiialpha , camkiibeta,camkiigamma and camkiidelta and the adult heart is composed of ~ 56 % myocytes , 27 % fibroblasts , 7 % endothelial cells , and 10 % vascular smooth muscle cells [ 46 ] , we felt the urge to characterize the expression of camkii isoforms in our cardiac myocyte models , namely the h9c2 myoblasts and adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes .
both h9c2 and adult rat cardiomyocytes express camkii alpha , beta , gamma and delta isoforms , and this finding is in accordance with previous literature [ 47 - 51 ] , albeit other reports suggest that the heart does not express camkii alpha and beta isoforms [ 52 ]. of note , though , our results indicate that the most abundant camkii isoform in adult rat cardiomyocytes is camkii beta , since camkii alpha , delta and gamma are only detectable when concentrated by immunoprecipitation .
these data contradict the notion that camkiidelta is the most important camkii isoform in the heart. by a critical perusal of the literature , it appears that this assumption is based on early reports that analyzed camkii expression by mrna expression from mrna extracted by the whole heart [ 10 , 53 - 55 ] .
on the contrary , we evaluated expression of the isoforms using commercial , validated antibodies which are of wide use by researcher in the field and that recognize in rat the respective isoforms of camkii .
furthermore , our results are obtained in cultured cardiac myoblasts or freshly isolated ventricular myocytes ; we also compared the relative expression in these cells with the most abundant source of camkii isoforms in the body of the rat , the brain .
therefore , we are convinced that differences in the model used and dissimilarities between mrna and proteins may account for the divergences observed between our and previous reports .
our data do not exclude that less expressed isoforms of camkii might play a role in lvh ; on the contrary , we believe that our results point in particular to the nuclear isoforms of camkii .
in this regard , we confirm that camkii delta is the most important nuclear isoform in cardiac myocytes .
our data , furthermore , indicate that the recently described mechanism of stimulation of nuclear transcription by camkii activation of erk is possibly relevant also in the setup of lvh .
in particular , we demonstrate that inhibition of camkii results in the loss of erk accumulation within the nucleus .
these data are in agreement and help to reconcile previous literature .
in particular , it has been observed that nuclear inhibition of camkii does not prevent hypertrophy in response to physiological stimulation [ 56 ] .
on the contrary , another report shows that camkii isoforms deletion results in attenuation of hypertrophy [ 5 , 57 ] .
according to our results both findings can co - exists , since the crosstalk between erk and camkii takes play in the cytosol and favors accumulation of erk in the nucleus .
selective inhibition of nuclear camkii isoform will not prevent erk to enter the nucleus and determine activation of erk dependent transcription factors related to hypertrophy [ 58 ] .
the mechanism of inhibition of camkii by camkii - kiin - based peptides represents an alternative strategy based on the steric inhibition of a conformational change of the kinase that is needed for its activation , rather than with the occupation of the atp pocket ( 21 ) .
although previously used for proof of concept studies , these peptides , and in particular antcantide , were never used before in vivo .
camkii selective inhibition with both antcantide and tat - cn17beta efficiently reduced the hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes , as well as the remodeling of the heart .
we therefore considered antcantide as a leading compound , and identified its minimal inhibitory sequence , that resides in residues 1 - 17 ( 27 ) .
the novel tat - cn17beta peptide recapitulates the inhibitory properties of the parental antcantide peptide , both in vitro and in vivo , and the shorter sequence provides a basis for the identification of the minimal inhibitory sequence and the future molecular design of pharmacological inhibitors .
our findings retain most relevance in light of the multiple signaling converging on camkii , in different cellular types that contribute to the development of lvh .
neurohormonal signals elevated in heart disease can stimulate camkii activity. of interest , beta - adrenergic [ 59 ] and angiotensin ii ( 7 ) receptor stimulation both independently result in camkii activation .
likewise , camkii inhibition reverses the hypertrophic and anti - apoptotic effects of these agonists , respectively [ 7 , 60 ] .
also in inflammatory cells , camkii participates to at1r - mediated nad ( p ) h oxidase activation , leading to generation of reactive oxygen species , widely implicated in vascular inflammation and fibrosis .
ang ii also promotes the association of scaffolding proteins , such as paxillin , talin , and p130c as , leading to focal adhesion and extracellular matrix formation [ 61 ] .
all these phenotypes , being camk dependent , could be mitigated by a selective inhibitor of camk activity .
perspectives our data represent the first demonstration that pharmacological inhibition of camkii is effective in reducing cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in an animal model of hypertension - induced lvh .
this study might provide the basis for a further exploration of the hypertension related phenotype in the shr , such as cardiac arrhythmias , sudden death and survival .
also , it is a further advance in the understanding of physiology of cardiac remodeling that could be useful to develop targeted therapies in lvh models as well as other models of heart failure and impaired cardiac function references 1 fujisawa h . regulation of the activities of multifunctional ca2 +/ calmodulin - dependent protein kinases . j biochem .

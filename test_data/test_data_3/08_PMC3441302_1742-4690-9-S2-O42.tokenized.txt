methods 36 patients with cd4 + > 450 cells / mm3 were randomized ( 2:1 ) to receive 3 immunizations every 2 weeks with dc pulsed with autologous heat - inactivated hiv - 1 ( cases , n = 24 ) or with non - pulsed dc ( controls , n = 12 ) .
changes in viral load ( vl ) as well as changes in cd4 cell counts have been evaluated .
additionally hiv specific responses were measured in pbmc samples from different time - points by lpr and by ifn - gamma - elispot against gag , nef and gp41 hiv overlapping peptide pools , respectively .
results vl rebounded to detectable level in all the patients .
at week 12 and 24 , a decrease of vl >= 1 log was observed in 12 / 22 ( 55 %) vs 1 / 11 ( 9 %) and in 7 / 20 ( 35 %) vs 0 / 10 ( 0 %) in cases and controls , respectively ( p = 0.02 , p = 0.03 ) .
cd4 drop to baseline value before any cart without differences between groups .
although only transient positive responses to hiv p24 were observed , the median change in lpr to hiv p24 at week 24 from baseline was 0.96 vs - 0.50 ( p = 0.02 ) in cases vs controls , respectively .
baseline median values of the total sum of hiv specific responses against hiv peptide pools were similar in both arms ( 2625 versus 2283 sfc / 106 pbmc , p = 0.462 ) .
after vaccination , the median change of total sum of sfc / 106 pbmc at week 24 was 3567 vs 838 sfc / 106 pbmc ( p = 0.0459 ) in cases and controls , respectively .
this difference was more evident when analyzing responses against gag p17 and nef peptide pools ( p = 0.0288 and p = 0.03615 , respectively ) .
no statistically significant correlations between immune responses and vl were found .
conclusion these results indicate that hiv - 1 specific immune responses elicited by therapeutic dc vaccines could significantly change pvl set - point after cart interruption in chronic hiv - 1 infected patients .

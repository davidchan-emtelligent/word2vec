hiv - 1 blocks apoptosis , programmed cell death , an innate defense of cells against viral invasion .
however , apoptosis can be selectively reactivated in hiv - infected cells by chemical agents that interfere with hiv - 1 gene expression .
we studied two globally used medicines , the topical antifungal ciclopirox and the iron chelator deferiprone , for their effect on apoptosis in hiv - infected h9 cells and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with clinical hiv - 1 isolates .
both medicines activated apoptosis preferentially in hiv - infected cells , suggesting that the drugs mediate escape from the viral suppression of defensive apoptosis .
in infected h9 cells , ciclopirox and deferiprone enhanced mitochondrial membrane depolarization , initiating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis to execution , as evidenced by caspase - 3 activation , poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase proteolysis , dna degradation , and apoptotic cell morphology .
in isolate - infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells , ciclopirox collapsed hiv - 1 production to the limit of viral protein and rna detection .
despite prolonged monotherapy , ciclopirox did not elicit breakthrough .
no viral re - emergence was observed even 12 weeks after drug cessation , suggesting elimination of the proviral reservoir .
tests in mice predictive for cytotoxicity to human epithelia did not detect tissue damage or activation of apoptosis at a ciclopirox concentration that exceeded by orders of magnitude the concentration causing death of infected cells .
we infer that ciclopirox and deferiprone act via therapeutic reclamation of apoptotic proficiency ( trap ) in hiv - infected cells and trigger their preferential elimination .
perturbations in viral protein expression suggest that the antiretroviral activity of both drugs stems from their ability to inhibit hydroxylation of cellular proteins essential for apoptosis and for viral infection , exemplified by eif5a .
our findings identify ciclopirox and deferiprone as prototypes of selectively cytocidal antivirals that eliminate viral infection by destroying infected cells .
a drug - based drug discovery program , based on these compounds , is warranted to determine the potential of such agents in clinical trials of hiv - infected patients .

introduction human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv - 1 ) evades the innate and adaptive responses of the immune system , and exploits both to its advantage .
in susceptible cells , hiv - 1 establishes infection that resists clearance by all current antiretrovirals .
only rarely and under special circumstances may combination antiretroviral therapy ( cart ) restrain hiv - 1 from re - establishing productive infection upon cart cessation , eliciting post - treatment control [ 1 ] .
the continued presence of hiv - 1 dna in these patients reaffirms the robust resistance of hiv - 1 to clearance by pharmacological means .
a major feature of this resistance is hiv - 1 interference with the primal cellular defense against viral invasion and takeover , programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) [ 2 ] - [ 5 ] .
after hiv - 1 entry , apoptosis remains functional for a brief period [ 6 ] .
marked resistance to pro - apoptotic stimuli occurs in hiv - infected cell lines and cultured primary cells , but not their uninfected counterparts , mediated by retroviral proteins and mirnas [ 7 ] - [ 10 ] .
in brain and blood , infected monomyelocytic cells are protected against apoptosis [ 11 ] .
their stable anti - apoptotic gene expression secures viability as mobile infective units and long - term reservoirs [ 12 ] .
only 0.1 % of productively infected cells in lymph nodes become apoptotic [ 13 ] .
furthermore , hiv - 1 re - programs susceptible cells to kill uninfected ' bystanders' [ 9 ] , [ 13 ] , resulting in extensive apoptosis of hiv - specific cytotoxic lymphocytes [ 14 ] .
t cell depletion , due to virally promoted apoptotic death of uninfected and eventually of infected cells , is the major cause of immune deficiency [ 12 ] - [ 15 ] .
the prominent role of apoptosis in hiv / aids was recognized early [ 16 ] - [ 18 ] , suggesting that inhibitors of apoptosis could be combined with antiretrovirals to preserve immune system function by promoting the survival of infected cells and uninfected ' bystanders' [ 13 ] , [ 19 ] .
while this suggestion remains viable , the studies reported here support an alternative approach , namely the use of activators of apoptosis for the ablation of pathogenic hiv - infected cells that destroy the immune system .
in oncology , the intentional ablation of pathogenic cells by interventions that activate apoptosis is widely practiced and a leitmotif in anti - cancer drug development [ 20 ] .
therapeutic recruitment of the apoptotic mechanism has also been exploited to control graft - versus - host disease in patients [ 21 ] , but this strategy has not been well explored in virology .
to test the concept of pro - apoptotic therapy in hiv - 1 infection , we examined the activity of two medicines previously shown to inhibit hiv - 1 gene expression in cellular models and hiv - 1 replication in infected pbmcs cultured ex vivo [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
ciclopirox ( cpx ; 6 - cyclohexyl - 1 - hydroxy - 4 - methylpyridin - 2 [ 1h ] - one : e.g. , batrafen ( tm )) is a well - tolerated topical fungicide in gynecological and dermatological preparations .
deferiprone ( def ; 3 - hydroxy - 1,2 - dimethylpyridin - 4 ( 1h ) - one : e.g. , ferriprox ( tm )) is a systemically active medicinal chelator administered orally to transfusionally iron - overloaded thalassemia patients .
if successful , our approach would bypass expensive and high - risk preclinical stages of de novo drug development by exploiting the off - target activity of approved , globally available non - hiv medicines to define novel , therapeutically desirable on - target effects directly in humans .
precedents for this drug - based drug discovery approach , which builds on easily overlooked side activities of clinically established medicines , include the development of diuretics and oral antidiabetics from the sulfonamide antibiotics , and of antipsychotics from the antihistamines [ 24 ] .
cpx and def are iron - chelating hydroxypyridinones ( hopos ) , classified among the 1,2 - and 3,4 - hopos , respectively [ 25 ] .
both drugs were identified as candidate inhibitors of protein hydroxylation by searching drug libraries for structures that fit the stereochemical parameters of the catalytic mechanism proposed for 2 - oxoacid - utilizing protein hydroxylases [ 26 ] - [ 33 ] .
cpx , def , and mimosine , a veterinarily employed def analogue , were confirmed to inhibit protein hydroxylation by these dioxygenases at therapeutically achievable concentrations [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
the compounds were predicted [ 36 ] and confirmed [ 22 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] to be inhibitors of the hydroxylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a ( eif5a ) by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase ( dohh ) .
dohh is an apparent monooxygenase whose active site pocket contains a non - heme iron center essential for activity and inhibition [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
dohh forms the distinctive hypusine residue of eif5a , a cellular protein involved in the control of apoptosis [ 22 ] , [ 41 ] - [ 48 ] and the replication of hiv - 1 and fiv - 1 [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 49 ] - [ 54 ] .
def and cpx inhibit hiv - 1 gene expression at the level of transcript initiation [ 23 ] , potentially disrupting viral control over cellular apoptosis , acute infection , and the function of the immune system .
consistent with this hypothesis , def triggers apoptosis in a latently hiv - infected cell line after mitogen stimulation , but not in its uninfected parent [ 22 ] , although the underlying pro - apoptotic mechanism was not established .
here we address the generality of this antiretroviral pro - apoptotic activity and define its mechanism .
our results show that both cpx and def overcome retrovirally - induced resistance to apoptosis and activate apoptosis selectively in a chronically hiv - infected cd4 + t cell line .
the apoptotic mechanism is triggered through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway .
prior to apoptosis , cpx suppresses acute infection of primary human cells ( peripheral blood mononuclear cells , pbmcs ) exposed to patient - isolated hiv - 1 .
self - sustaining hiv - 1 infection in long - term pbmc cultures was effectively cleared by cpx and productive infection did not return after cessation of treatment .
despite its pro - apoptotic activity at low microm concentrations in culture , preferentially in infected cells , topical cpx at mm concentrations did not cause deleterious effects in a mouse model predictive for damage to human tissues .
parallel experiments with def led to a double - blinded proof - of - concept trial , to be reported elsewhere ( saxena et al. , unpublished data ) .
we propose a novel antiretroviral target , the inhibition of protein hydroxylation , and suggest that cpx and def can serve as pioneer drugs for exploratory trials and as leads for chemical optimizations with the goal to obtain selectively cytocidal antivirals .
results cpx and def trigger apoptosis in h9 cells via the intrinsic pathway an earlier study showed that treatment of hiv - infected h9 cells ( h9 - hiv ) with def dramatically reduced virion formation and p24 levels [ 22 ] .
the drug caused nuclear condensation and enhanced dna fragmentation in latently infected ach - 2 cells induced by phorbol ester , but not in parental cem cells [ 22 ] .
these observations , together with accumulating data on the inhibitory action of both cpx and def on eif5a hydroxylation [ 35 ] , [ 38 ] , hiv - 1 infection in pbmcs and viral gene expression in model systems [ 23 ] , suggested that the two drugs might have a common mode of action via the induction of apoptosis in hiv - infected cells .
we first determined whether cpx and def elicit apoptosis in h9 - hiv cells .
annexin - v binding , cell diameter and cell survival were assayed in a time - dependent manner. by 24 hr , drug treatment led to a ~ 5 - fold increase in the percentage of the 7 - amino - actinomycin d ( 7 - aad ) - negative cell population capable of binding annexin - v to exposed membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine , with little further increase at 48 hr ( fig. 1a ) .
both drugs caused a decrease in mean cell diameter of ~ 15 % within 24 hr and ~ 30 % within 48 hr ( fig. 1b ) , indicating apoptotic volume decrease ( avd ) [ 55 ] , an early and prerequisite event in apoptosis [ 56 ] that reflects cell dismantling into apoptotic bodies [ 57 ] and contrasts with the cell volume increase typical of necrosis [ 58 ] .
concomitantly , cell survival decreased ~ 2 fold at 24 hr and ~ 5 fold at 48 hr ( fig. 1c ) .
cpx and def exerted similar effects with similar kinetics on these apoptotic indicators , suggesting that both drugs trigger apoptosis in this t lymphocytic cell line chronically infected with hiv - 1 .

results ( mean +/ - sem ) were obtained by flow cytometry using jc - 1 and are expressed relative to untreated control cells .
p values are indicated .
collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential , deltapsi , is an early event in apoptotic death triggered via the intrinsic pathway , leading to proteolytic activation of initiator and effector caspases including caspase - 3 [ 59 ] .
one consequence of caspase - 3 activation is the cleavage of poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase ( parp ) , resulting in the accumulation of an 89 - kda parp fragment indicative of nuclear proteolysis [ 60 ] .
we therefore monitored the deltapsi and parp status of h9 and h9 - hiv cells .
flow cytometric analysis showed that both the collapse of deltapsi and the cleavage of parp were attenuated in hiv - h9 cells relative to h9 cells ( fig. 1d ) .
specifically , deltapsi collapse was about half as frequent in hiv - h9 cells as in uninfected h9 cells , and approximately one - third as many cells were positive for parp cleavage in hiv - h9 cell cultures as in uninfected h9 cultures .
these data indicate that apoptosis in h9 cells is triggered via the intrinsic pathway and is attenuated by hiv - 1 infection .
drug - mediated reversal of resistance to apoptosis in hiv - infected cells we next compared the effect of the drugs on apoptosis in h9 and h9 - hiv cells .
both cpx and def increased the collapse of deltapsi in a manner that was concentration - dependent and accentuated by viral infection ( fig. 1e,f ) .
relative to uninfected cells , hiv - infected cells displayed significantly increased collapse of deltapsi at the standard drug concentrations used in this study ( 30 microm cpx ; 200 microm def ) .
furthermore , the h9 - hiv cultures exhibited enhanced deltapsi collapse at lower drug concentrations ( 5 and 15 microm cpx ; 50 and 100 microm def ) than in uninfected h9 cells ( 30 microm cpx ; 200 microm def ) .
thus , exposure to cpx or def counteracted the hiv - mediated reduction of deltapsi collapse and rendered infected cells more susceptible than uninfected cells to this early step of apoptosis .
to determine whether the differential effects of the drugs extend into late apoptosis , we measured parp fragmentation in h9 and h9 - hiv cells .
cpx caused an ~ 8 - fold increase in h9 - hiv cells positive for 89 - kda parp , compared to ~ 2 fold in h9 cells ( fig. 2a ). by 24 hr , twice as many cells stained positive for 89 - kda parp in the infected treated cultures as in uninfected treated cultures ( 27 % compared to 14 % ; fig. 2b ) .
furthermore , the fluorescence intensity was approximately one order of magnitude higher in the presence of hiv - 1 ( fig. 2b ) .
these differences persisted after 48 hr of cpx treatment ( fig. 2c ) .
def gave similar but less pronounced effects ( saxena et al. , unpublished data ) .
we conclude that the retroviral suppression of initiation and execution of apoptosis [ 7 ] - [ 13 ] is reversed by the drugs and transformed into enhanced susceptibility of hiv - infected cells to apoptosis ( fig. 1d vs. fig. 2a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0074414.g002 figure 2 ciclopirox increases apoptosis preferentially in hiv - infected h9 cells. a. increased formation of the caspase - 3 - fragmented 89 - kda form of parp in h9 - hiv ( red ) and uninfected h9 ( blue ) after 24 hr of treatment with 30 microm cpx .

b , c. cell counts over the fluorescence intensity spectrum for 89 - kda parp reactivity , quantified by flow cytometric single cell analysis after 24 hr ( b ) and 48 hr ( c ) of treatment with 30 microm cpx .
percentages of frag - parp - positive h9 - hiv ( red ) and uninfected h9 ( blue ) are calculated .
cellular and viral protein levels during drug - induced apoptosis the enhancement of deltapsi collapse suggested that the drugs might repress anti - apoptotic proteins that stabilize deltapsi , in particular bcl - 2 [ 61 ] .
cd4 + t cells isolated from infected individuals have increased bcl - 2 levels compared to uninfected lymphocytes [ 62 ] and several reports implicate hiv - 1 tat in preventing apoptosis in persistently infected cells by inducing bcl - 2 transcription [ 63 ] - [ 65 ] .
since cpx blocks hiv - 1 gene expression [ 23 ] , we determined bcl - 2 expression in h9 and h9 - hiv cells .
after treatment with cpx for 24 hr , ~ 35 % of cells stained positive for bcl - 2 , irrespective of infection ( fig. 3a ) .
although uninfected cells displayed a modest dose - dependent decrease in bcl - 2 content , contrasting with a slight increase in infected cells , neither of these measures achieved statistical significance ( fig. 3b ) .
def gave similar results ( not shown ) .
these data do not support a role for bcl - 2 suppression in the drug - induced enhancement of apoptosis in h9 - hiv cells , in accord with conclusions drawn from a study of other agents that cause apoptosis in hiv - infected cells [ 8 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0074414.g003 figure 3 effects of ciclopirox on cellular and retroviral proteins in h9 cells .

b : cpx concentration dependence of bcl - 2 reactivity expressed as the geometric mean of fluorescence ( mean +/ - sem ). c. response of proteins in h9 - hiv cells to 30 microm cpx after exposure for 24 hr ( hatched bars ) and 48 hr ( filled bars ) .
retroviral and cellular proteins were labeled immunocytochemically and quantified in the same sample by flow cytometry .
data are presented as the geometric mean of fluorescence , normalized to time - identical infected untreated controls ( 100 % values at 24 / 48 hr : p24 , 36.2 / 38.2 ; tat , 168.1 / 141.6 ; rev , 7.8 / 6.4 ; vpr , 1.7 / 1.7 ; activated caspase - 3 , 1.3 / 1.3 ) .
p values for deviation from respective controls are indicated : * = 0.02 ; ** <= 0.004 ; *** <= 0.0004 .
retroviral proteins can control apoptosis .
we therefore measured the response of individual retroviral proteins in h9 - hiv cells ( fig. 3c ) to the shutdown of the hiv - 1 promoter by cpx .
this drug reduced intracellular p24 by 30 % within 24 hr , and by 70 % within 48 hr , consistent with results in 293t cells [ 23 ] .
intracellular tat was similarly reduced .
rev was only marginally affected , however , possibly due to its greater stability ( the half - life of p24 and tat is ~ 3 hr [ 66 ] , [ 67 ] while that of rev is at least 16 hr [ 68 ]) .
paradoxically , the levels of vpr increased by ~ 15 % within 24 hr and ~ 70 % within 48 hr , suggesting a degree of autonomy from transcription - dependent accumulation consistent with previous reports [ 69 ] , [ 70 ] .
def elicited a similar response , sparing rev , decreasing p24 and tat , and increasing vpr ( not shown ) .
the rise in vpr paralleled that of active caspase - 3 ( fig. 3c ) .
vpr at increased intracellular levels [ 71 ] is proapoptotic [ 72 ] - [ 78 ] , and vpr - driven cell death is characterized by many of the parameters recorded above , such as increased annexin binding [ 72 ] , changes in cell size and volume [ 74 ] , deltapsi collapse [ 75 ] , parp cleavage [ 76 ] , and dna fragmentation [ 77 ]. by contrast , intracellular tat displays antiapoptotic activity [ 63 ] , [ 65 ] , conducive to establishment of infection and latency [ 79 ] .
although tat and vpr can each display either anti - or proapoptotic activities depending on the test system [ 78 ] , [ 79 ] , in the context of our study the divergence in their levels ( fig. 3c ) suggests a functional imbalance between these viral controllers of apoptosis that contributes to the drug - induced apoptotic death of hiv - infected cells ( see discussion ) .
structure - activity relations both cpx and def are hydroxypyridinones with vicinally positioned oxygen atoms that mediate bidentate interaction with metal ions , in particular fe3 + ( fig. 4a ) [ 25 ] .
to evaluate the effect of iron - chelating drugs on the intracellular iron pool and on hiv - 1 gene expression , we exploited transient expression assays in human 293t cells .
intracellular iron was assayed using a construct in which a physiological iron - responsive element ( ire ) controls luciferase expression [ 80 ] .
this approach is highly specific for iron , due to the metal selectivity of the ire [ 81 ] , and provides a functional parameter not captured by commercial fluorescent iron sensors ( fis ) [ 82 ] .
hiv - specific transcription was assayed in parallel using an hiv - 1 molecular clone that expresses a luciferase reporter under the direction of the retroviral promoter [ 23 ] .
cpx and def were compared with the medicinal chelator deferoxamine ( dfox ) and with the cpx fragment agent p2 , which consists of the metal - binding 1,2 - hopo domain of cpx without its cyclohexyl moiety ( fig. 4a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0074414.g004 figure 4 dohh inhibition , apoptosis , and structure - dependent chelation of intracellular iron. a. covalent structures of the medicinal chelators dfox and def , and of the antifungal agent cpx and its chelation homolog agent p2 .
dfox , cpx , and agent p2 interact with iron via a hydroxyurea - like hydroxamate moiety that is similar to the chelating domain of def ( shaded ) .
arrows indicate this moiety 's uniform bidentate mode of metal binding .
dfox contains three of these moieties and is a hexadentate chelator. b. effect of drugs and agent p2 on the expression of iron - dependent ( ire ; hatched bars ) and retrovirally - encoded ( hiv ; filled bars ) gene expression in transfected 293t cells .

triangles , peptide - bound hypusine ; squares , peptide - bound deoxyhypusine. d. induction of apoptosis by cpx and by dfox .
h9 - hiv were treated for 24 hr and then assayed by flow cytometry using tunel .
results are expressed as percentage of cells that are tunel - positive (+/ - sem ) .
cpx and def reduced intracellular iron by 80 % and ~ 60 % , respectively ( fig. 4b , hatched bars ) .
dfox , tested at 15 microm , close to the plateau concentration reported in patients ( 13.7 microm [ 83 ]) , also reduced intracellular iron by 80 % ( fig. 4b ) .
these ire - based results for def and dfox are consistent with fis - based data on the depletion of the intracellular iron pool by either drug [ 84 ] - [ 86 ] .
as expected [ 23 ] cpx and def decreased hiv - 1 expression by 40 - 50 % ( fig. 4b , filled bars ) .
dfox had no effect on hiv - driven gene expression , however , indicating that depletion of chelatable intracellular iron does not translate directly into antiretroviral activity .
this conclusion is consistent with the failure of dfox to suppress hiv - 1 gene expression and replication in culture [ 23 ] , [ 87 ] and to prevent disease progression and death in hiv - infected patients [ 88 ] .
dfox is an effective inhibitor of iron - containing protein hydroxylases only at supraclinical concentrations [ 35 ] , [ 89 ] , [ 90 ] .
as predicted from its structure , agent p2 displays a cpx - like ability to form bidentate chelates with fe3 + that produce tris ( n - hydroxypyridinone ligand ) complexes ( fig. s1a ) , but it had no effect on either ire - dependent or hiv - encoded luciferase expression ( fig. 4b ) at concentrations equimolar to cpx .
furthermore , agent p2 failed to inhibit cellular eif5a hydroxylation even at a concentration at which cpx completely suppressed hydroxylation ( fig. 4c ) , and its apparent ki for dohh inhibition in vitro was ~ 7 - times higher than that of cpx ( fig. s1b ) .
evidently , the cyclohexyl moiety of cpx is required for cell entry , dohh inhibition , and antiretroviral activity .
the relationship between iron chelation and apoptosis was assessed using the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dutp nick end labeling ( tunel ) assay to measure dna fragmentation .
def induces this late apoptotic event in hiv - expressing ach - 2 cells [ 22 ] .
similarly , cpx triggered dna fragmentation in h9 - hiv cells in a dose - dependent manner with a steep , almost 10 - fold increase in tunel - positive cells between 10 and 20 microm cpx that leveled off at 40 microm ( fig. 4d ) .
agent p2 was ineffective ( not shown ) .
dfox did not enhance dna fragmentation even at 20 microm , which exceeds the peak levels achievable in human plasma [ 83 ] ( fig. 4d ) .
we conclude that the antiretroviral activities of cpx and def in hiv - infected cells require more than global iron chelation .
specifically , apoptosis and the inhibition of retroviral gene expression by these drugs are not mediated simply via the depletion of extracellular or intracellular ferric ions , or of other metal ions chelated by these drugs .
inhibition of acute viral infection and activation of apoptosis in hiv - infected pbmc cultures to examine the antiretroviral action of cpx in a clinic - derived model , we used pbmcs infected with patient isolates of hiv - 1 .
naive freshly isolated pbmcs from a single donor were infected by co - cultivation with hiv - infected , hla - nonidentical pbmcs at an initial uninfected / infected cell ratio of 10:1 .
cpx was added and cells were maintained and monitored for six days .
half of each culture supernatant was replenished daily with cpx - containing or cpx - free medium as appropriate .
in control cultures , robust infection invariably occurred during this period , achieving p24 and viral rna copy levels and a p24 / viral copy ratio similar to those reported in patients [ 91 ] .
the kinetics of infection varied depending on the particular pbmc donor / hiv isolate combination .
for the donor / isolate combination shown in figure 5 , p24 formation briskly increased 96 hr after inoculation with hiv - infected pbmcs .
addition of cpx at 48 hr completely inhibited p24 production , as shown previously [ 23 ] , and doubling the cpx concentration to 60 microm did not further increase this suppressive effect ( fig. 5a ) .
correspondingly , cpx inhibited the production of hiv - 1 rna ( fig. 5b ) , indicating that the drug completely suppressed the establishment of productive infection .
agent p2 , the chelation homolog of cpx , did not curtail the accumulation of p24 or hiv - 1 rna ( fig. 5a,b ) , consistent with its lack of effect on hiv - 1 gene expression in h9 - hiv cells ( fig. 4b ) .
the delay - insensitivity of the antiretroviral activity of cpx in pbmcs argues against interference with early events such as retroviral binding to cell receptors or fusion with the target cell membrane .

cultures were left untreated ( open squares ) or either cpx ( red triangles ) or agent p2 ( green circles ) was added at 48 hr after plating / inoculation to 30 microm ( small symbols ) or 60 microm ( large symbols ) .
hiv - 1 protein ( p24 ; a ) and copy number ( hiv - 1 rna ; b ) were assayed at 24 - hr intervals .
the induction of apoptosis was analyzed with donor / isolate combinations that displayed rapid emergence of productive infection .
in such cultures , the protein and nucleic acid indices of active retroviral infection rose within 72 hr after inoculation with infected pbmcs ( fig. 6a,b ) .
the increases in retroviral p24 and rna occurred in a synchronous manner ( r = + 0.92 , p < 0.01 ) .
cpx , whether added at the time of inoculation ( not shown ) or 12 hr later ( fig. 6a,b ) , inhibited hiv - 1 replication .
hiv - 1 p24 remained undetectable throughout six days of incubation ( fig. 6a ) , and extracellular hiv - 1 rna did not increase at any time over the initial infectious dose , whereas it increased > 100 fold in hiv - exposed untreated cultures ( fig. 6b ) .
using the tunel assay for dna fragmentation , < 10 % of cells in infected or uninfected untreated cultures were apoptotic 144 hr after inoculation ( fig. 6c ) .
this population increased to 24.1 % (+/ - 3.2 %) of cells in cpx - treated uninfected cultures. by contrast , it rose dramatically to 71.8 % (+/ - 8.8 %) of cpx - treated cells exposed to hiv - 1 ( p = 0.009 ) ( fig. 6c ) .
similar to h9 cells ( fig. 2a ) , cpx roughly doubled the proportion of tunel - positive pbmcs in uninfected cultures but caused a ~ 10 - fold increase in hiv - infected cultures .
apoptosis emerged after 120 hr in treated infected cultures ( fig. 6c ; dark gray period ) , whereas productive infection in untreated pbmc cultures reached a maximum within 72 hr ( fig. 6a,b ; dark gray period ) .
thus , untreated infected pbmcs displayed marked hiv - 1 expression early ( green segments in phase i ; fig. 6a - c ) and displayed minimal apoptosis subsequently ( green segment in phase ii ) , whereas hiv - exposed cpx - treated pbmcs showed no hiv - 1 expression in phase i but extensive apoptosis in phase ii ( red segments ; fig. 6a - c ) .
similar results were obtained with def ( saxena et al. , unpublished data ) .
these observations are consistent with the induction of apoptosis in infected cells if the expression of critical hiv - 1 genes is blocked .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0074414.g006 figure 6 inhibitory action of ciclopirox in rapid - onset infection of primary cells .
a - c. blockade of acute hiv - 1 infection and activation of hiv - enhanced apoptosis .
uninfected pbmcs from a single - donor were cultured without infection ( open symbols ) or were infected with 58,500 copies / ml of hiv - 1 isolate # 990,010 ( filled symbols ) .
after 12 hr , cpx was added to 30 microm ( open squares ) or cultures were left untreated ( triangles ) .
hiv - 1 p24 ( a ) and rna ( b ) were assayed at intervals and apoptotic cells were enumerated by tunel ( c ) .
active retroviral gene expression occurs in phase i , preceding suppression of apoptosis in phase ii ( green line segments ) .
in cpx - treated infected cultures , retroviral gene expression is inhibited in phase i and apoptosis is activated in phase ii ( red line segments ) .
d , e. response of innate cytokines .
cells were treated as above , except that cpx addition was coincident with infection .
ifn - gamma ( d ) and il - 10 ( e ) were analyzed during phase i in the same samples by flow cytometric bead assay .
values are the mean of two independent experiments ( initial levels in pg / 106 vital cells for hiv - exposed cpx - treated , hiv - exposed untreated , and uninfected cpx - treated cells : 657 , 209 , and 634 for ifn - gamma ; 34 , 13 , and 40 for il - 10 ) .
cytokines play key roles during hiv - 1 infection and predict disease progression [ 92 ] .
to further assess the action of cpx on hiv - infected primary cells , we measured their ability to launch a cytokine reaction to the virus .
we measured the levels of interferon ( ifn ) - gamma and interleukin ( il ) - 10 , since in vivo their plasma levels are altered at the earliest point of hiv - 1 infection [ 92 ] , [ 93 ] .
ifn - gamma , a representative th1 cytokine that activates antiviral defenses , is elevated early in infection and decreases with disease progression [ 94 ] .
il - 10 , a representative th2 cytokine that limits immune system activity , increases markedly as cd4 counts fall [ 95 ] , [ 96 ] .
both cytokines were measured in infected , cpx - treated or untreated pbmc cultures .
in hiv - exposed untreated cultures , the levels of ifn - gamma and il - 10 increased at 72 hr by ~ 14 - and ~ 4 - fold , respectively ( fig. 6d,e ) , closely paralleling the rise of viral parameters ( fig. 6a,b ; r = + 0.94 , p < 0.05 ) .
cpx abolished the hiv - induced cell stimulation reflected by ifn - gamma and il - 10 synthesis , irrespective of whether the drug was added at the time of inoculation ( fig. 6d,e ) or 12 hr later ( not shown ) .
il - 6 , which is markedly increased in the plasma of hiv - infected persons in a secondary , acute - phase inflammatory response [ 97 ] , rose by a factor of 5.5 in untreated hiv - exposed pbmc cultures , and by a factor of 1.8 in cpx - treated hiv - exposed cultures ( not shown ) .
def gave similar results ( not shown ) .
in drug - treated infected cultures , the lack of a cytokine response therefore concurred with the inhibition of virological indices ( fig. 6a,b ) .
we conclude that cpx and def block the acute infection of freshly isolated pbmcs by patient isolates of hiv - 1 to such an extent that viral production is undetectable and the innate cytokine response is not activated .
termination of infection in drug - treated pbmcs we next asked whether cpx can control established hiv - 1 infection in primary cells .
long - term pbmc cultures were employed as a model for on - going , self - sustaining hiv - 1 production .
as before , infection was initiated by exposure to patient isolate - infected cells .
to emulate the bulk flow of susceptible cells from a generative into an infective compartment that occurs in vivo , we followed a replenishment protocol .
freshly isolated uninfected primary cells were infused into the infected cultures at regular intervals during multi - month monitoring of viral parameters .
hiv - 1 rna reached the range of 106 copies / ml within a week of patient isolate inoculation ( fig. 7 , period 1 ) , and this robust infection was sustained for 4 months ( fig. 7 ; open squares ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0074414.g007 figure 7 long - term suppression of hiv - 1 infection in pbmc cultures by ciclopirox .
multiple - donor pbmc cultures were infected with isolate # 990,010 and replenished with fresh cells and medium as indicated by arrowheads ; on each occasion , half of the culture was replaced .
after one week ( period 1 ) to establish infection ex vivo , the culture was treated with 30 microm cpx for one month ( period 2 ) , then the drug was withdrawn ( asterisk ) and the culture was assayed for viral copy number during three post - treatment months ( period 3 ) to monitor for re - emerging productive infection .
p24 assays : open circle , hiv - exposed untreated cultures ; closed circles , hiv - exposed cultures , treated with cpx .
hiv - 1 rna assays : open squares , hiv - exposed untreated cultures ; closed triangles , hiv - exposed cultures during cpx treatment ; open triangles , hiv - exposed cultures after withdrawal of cpx .
arrows a and b denote the detection limits of the p24 and hiv - 1 rna assays , respectively .
due to the continuous replenishment with freshly isolated uninfected pbmcs , the viability of cultured cells was consistently above 90 % as assessed by computerized vital dye exclusion .
the introduction of cpx on day 7 , adjusted daily to maintain a constant level of 30 microm , reduced the virus to the limits of detectability with a week - to - week median decline of ^ log - 1.0 ( fig. 7 , period 2 ) ; individual decline kinetics varied with the donor - isolate combination .
apoptosis parameters ( tunel and avd ) did not differ from untreated controls ( not shown ) , attributed to the on - going replenishment of the cultures with freshly isolated pbmcs .
in the experiment shown here , hiv - 1 rna levels declined during the four week treatment by four orders of magnitude ( fig. 7 ; closed triangles ) , whereas the suppression of p24 occurred within 14 days ( fig. 7 ; closed circles ) .
we attribute the apparent lag in hiv - 1 rna inhibition to the broad dynamic range of the pcr - based rna assay ( note logarithmic scale ) compared to the relatively narrow range of the elisa - based p24 assay ( linear scale ) , and possibly to the packaging of rna into apoptotic bodies that protect against degradation by rnases [ 98 ] , [ 99 ] .
mathematical modeling ( fig. s2 ) indicated that the viral rna level decreases more slowly than the rate calculated for depletion by medium replenishment , arguing against a protocol - related artifactual decline .
evidently , cpx dramatically suppressed viral production in continuous pbmc culture and did not allow viral breakthrough during prolonged monotherapy (>= 30 days , fig. 7 ) .
similar results were obtained with def ( not shown ). by contrast , breakthrough occurs after as few as 20 days of monotherapy with standard antiretrovirals like lamivudine , emtricitabine , zidovudine , nevirapine , or foscarnet [ 100 ] - [ 103 ] , and is prevented only by combining several of these drugs [ 104 ] - [ 107 ] .
to determine whether any productively infected cells survived the suppressive effect of cpx monotherapy , we examined the possibility of viral resurgence following withdrawal of drug .
cultures were maintained for extended post - treatment observation periods and monitored for the re - emergence of hiv - 1 rna ( fig. 7 , period 3 ) .
strikingly , after drug cessation ( asterisk in fig. 7 ) hiv - 1 infection did not recur during post - treatment observation periods extending up to 90 days .
similar results were obtained in repeated experiments ( not shown ) .
def likewise produced off - drug suppression and consistent with apoptotic ablation of infected cells , reduced hiv - 1 dna to the limit of detection ( saxena et al. , unpublished data ). by contrast , monotherapy with standard antiretrovirals ( including zidovudine , lamivudine , nevirapine , delavirdine , loviride , tenofovir , ritonavir , indinavir , saquinavir , stavudine , festinavir , didanosine , or emitricitabine [ 108 ] , [ 109 ]) uniformly fails to delay resurgence of hiv - 1 production for more than 3 days off drug , despite an initial report that hiv - 1 " became negative " [ 110 ] .
marked reduction of hiv - 1 rna without off - drug resurgence requires combination of several of these antiretrovirals [ 104 ] - [ 106 ] .
we conclude that the apparent functional sterilization of hiv - infected primary cultures treated with cpx or def correlates with the preferential apoptotic ablation of hiv - infected cells , and thus the destruction of the proviral reservoir , by each of these drugs .
lack of apoptosis induction in a murine tissue damage model in the experiments reported here , cpx and def enhanced apoptotic indices in hiv - infected cells and also in uninfected cells , albeit to a significantly lesser degree ( fig. 1e,f ; fig. 6c ) .
we therefore studied the effects of both drugs in model systems predictive of toxicity in humans .
cpx was evaluated both functionally and histologically for effects on murine vaginal mucosa in a mouse model designed to assess the integrity of genital epithelium via susceptibility to challenges with herpes simplex virus type 2 ( hsv - 2 ) [ 111 ] - [ 113 ] .
the gynecological preparation of cpx ( 1 % batrafen vaginalcreme ( tm ) [ sanofi - aventis ]) , whose drug content exceeds the antiretroviral concentration of 30 microm cpx by orders of magnitude , was applied intravaginally .
this preparation generates drug levels in human surface tissues that range at 30 microm [ 114 ] .
treatment of the mice for four consecutive days did not increase susceptibility to vaginal infection with hsv - 2 .
in the low - dose hsv - 2 group , one of the untreated and none of the cpx - treated animals became infected ; in the high - dose hsv - 2 group , 8 of 10 animals became infected whether cpx - treated or not .
this lack of a gross effect on the protective function of the cervicovaginal mucosa was corroborated by histological examination .
cpx exposure did not disturb the medroxyprogesterone - induced surface - lining layer of living mucinous cells in these mice , nor did the drug disrupt the underlying layers of squamous epithelial cells ( fig. 8a,b ) .
notably , cpx did not trigger apoptosis in the epithelial or subepithelial compartments , as assessed by immunohistochemical detection of active caspase - 3 .
this protease locates to the nucleus after induction of apoptosis [ 115 ] and therefore reactivity to anti - active caspase - 3 displays a typical punctate pattern , highlighting the nuclei of cells undergoing apoptosis in tissue , as shown for human neonatal thymus ( fig. 8c ) and mouse ovarian follicles ( fig. 8d ) .
the nuclei of mucinous and squamous epithelial cells in cpx - exposed vaginal mucosa did not react with anti - active caspase - 3 , and their faint cytoplasmic hue did not differ from untreated mucosa ( fig. 8a2 , b2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0074414.g008 figure 8 treatment of mouse vaginal mucosa with ciclopirox .
a , b : histology of vaginal mucosa of medroxyprogesterone - synchronized mice , untreated ( a ) or intravaginally treated ( b ) for four consecutive days with the antifungal gynecological formulation of cpx ( 1 % batrafen vaginalcreme ( tm ) , equivalent to 28.8 mm cpx ) .
a1 and b1 , stained with hematoxylin - eosin ; a2 and b2 , stained with anti - active caspase - 3 .
due to the progestin synchronization of all animals , the vaginal mucosa of untreated ( a ) and treated ( b ) animals displays a luminal surface of living cuboidal mucinous cells , overlying uncornified strata of living squamous epithelial cells .
c , d : tissue reactivity to anti - active caspase - 3 for two organs known to contain cells undergoing apoptosis , human neonatal thymus ( c ) [ 216 ] and mouse ovary ( d1 - d3 ) [ 217 ] .
active caspase - 3 locates to the nuclei of cortical lymphocytes and folliculogenic cells , respectively , consistent with its established nuclear occurrence [ 115 ] , and generates a characteristic , punctate staining pattern .
batrafen - treated vaginal mucosa does not display this apoptotic pattern ( b2 ) , showing instead the faint cytoplasmic reactivity of untreated controls ( a2 ) .
the images of b2 , evidencing absence of apoptotic cells after vaginal batrafen exposure , and of d1 - d3 , evidencing presence of physiologically apoptotic cells in the ovary , were taken from the same longitudinal cut that sections an animal 's entire reproductive tract .
def was tested in tissue culture for its effect on the trans - epithelial resistance displayed by confluent human ecc - 1 cells linked by tight junctions [ 116 ] .
at 200 microm , a concentration that inhibits hiv - 1 replication and ranges at the peak values measured in human plasma [ 117 ] , def did not degrade the barrier function of the monolayer , signifying absence of an apoptotic effect on these uninfected cells ( saxena et al. , unpublished data ) .
in sum , neither cpx nor def gave evidence of apoptotic or other toxic effects on uninfected epithelia when applied at or above the concentrations that ablate hiv - infected cells ( figs. 1 , 2 , 4 and 6 ) and suppress de novo and established infection of pbmcs by viral isolates ( figs. 5 - 7 ) .
the lack of detrimental activity in these models suggests that drug - induced death of uninfected tissue elements in vivo is minimal or undetectable , consistent with the clinically established safety record of each medicine .
discussion the drugs investigated here , the antifungal agent cpx and the medicinal chelator def , inhibit retroviral gene expression in chronically infected t cells with concomitant activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis , resulting in suppression of acute infection and preferential ablation of infected cells .
in isolate - infected cultures of primary cells , cpx produced lasting post - treatment remission , assessed as absence of rebounding replication - competent virus and of resurgent hiv - 1 expression .
no damage to the uninfected cells of epithelial tissues in mice was detected .
in a double - blinded proof - of - concept trial , a one week - course of oral def caused an acute zidovudine - like reduction of viral load in individuals who attained the threshold serum level of the drug , defined according to the concentrations required in culture for inhibition of hiv - 1 gene expression and induction of apoptosis in infected cells as documented here and elsewhere [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
the viral load reduction persisted throughout seven weeks of monitoring after cessation of def ( saxena et al. , unpublished data ) .
these data suggest that medicinal activation of apoptosis in pathogenic infected cells is a viable antiviral strategy , for which we propose the term ' therapeutic reclamation of apoptotic proficiency ' ( trap ) .
related approaches using recombinant protein constructs rather than small molecules , have been tested against several viruses in cell culture and a mouse model [ 118 ] , [ 119 ] .
we infer that the trap concept has general applicability for the termination of viral infections .
viral versus therapeutic control over programmed cell death apoptosis is a stereotypical cellular defense against viral takeover .
numerous viruses neutralize this innate initial defense , including hiv - 1 [ 2 ] - [ 5 ] , [ 120 ] .
several hiv - 1 accessory proteins , exemplified by nef and vpr , disrupt antiviral resistance [ 121 ] .
rapid execution of apoptosis does occur upon entry of hiv - 1 into cd4 + t cells [ 6 ] , before the completion of reverse transcription and the vpr - enhanced expression of anti - apoptotic factors like nef from unintegrated viral dna [ 122 ] - [ 124 ] .
however , only a fraction of target t cells eludes the vpr blockade of anti - viral defenses [ 125 ] and is able to mount the innate antiviral suicide response [ 6 ] .
hiv - 1 entry usually leads to expression of viral gene products that interact with cellular components and modulate specific cellular activities , such as apoptosis or cytokine production , to achieve replicative advantage [ 7 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 64 ] , [ 125 ] - [ 127 ] .
as shown here and elsewhere [ 22 ] , cpx and def allow completion of the innate antiviral suicide response by promoting trap , thereby overcoming the retrovirally triggered resistance to apoptosis .
trap may also underlie the selectively cytocidal , antiretroviral activity of other small molecules .
adenine triggers selective ablation in an hiv - infected cd4 + cell line , apparently by changing the association of pro - apoptotic bax with the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator [ 128 ] , [ 129 ] .
selective induction of apoptosis in hiv - infected lymphocytes was reported for motexafin gadolinium ( xcytrin ( tm )) [ 130 ] , an experimental chemotherapeutic agent that triggers mitochondrially - mediated apoptosis [ 131 ] and inhibits the thioredoxin - glutathione system [ 132 ] , which protects mitochondria from oxidative stress [ 133 ] .
imatinib ( gleevec ( tm )) , an activator of mitochondria - dependent apoptosis used for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia [ 134 ] , elicits progressive increase of dna fragmentation in hiv - infected macrophages , but does not promote apoptotic death of uninfected macrophages [ 7 ] .
flavopiridol ( alvocidib ( tm )) activates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis [ 135 ] , [ 136 ] and causes extensive caspase - 3 - driven apoptosis in latently infected cell lines , but not their uninfected parents [ 137 ] .
in productively infected primary cells , flavopiridol displays progressive cytotoxicity [ 138 ] , as expected for the emergence of trap .
taken together , these observations suggest that trap may proceed in productively and latently hiv - infected lymphocytes or macrophages by re - activation of apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway , irrespective of whether the compound is able ( cpx , def , flavopiridol ) or unable ( adenine , imatinib ) to chelate metal , or is itself a metal chelate ( motexafin gadolinium ) .
such diversity of chemical structures presumably reflects the multiplicity of cascading pathways that converge on mitochondria and trigger the ' altruistic suicide ' of pathogenic cells [ 139 ] , implying that several of these pathways could be targeted for the selective elimination of hiv - 1 production sites and sanctuaries .
although therapeutic strategies in hiv / aids have to date focused principally on the virus and its immediate cellular targets , requiring continuous administration of suppressive agents , mitochondria are recognized as premier targets for triggering the death of pathogenic cells in oncology , to the point of eradicating the pool of such cells and overcoming the need for long - term medication [ 139 ] .
it is notable that hydroxyurea ( hydrea ( tm ) , droxia ( tm )) , a pro - apoptotic anticancer drug [ 140 ] - [ 143 ] , suppresses the activity of the hiv - 1 promoter [ 144 ] , depletes hiv - 1 dna in infected cultures thus eliminating off - drug resurgence of the virus [ 145 ] , and has clinically relevant antiretroviral activity [ 146 ] , [ 147 ] that in some individuals averts viral rebound after drug withdrawal [ 148 ] .
it has been proposed that this antiretroviral activity of hydroxyurea is not fully explained by the inhibition of its cytostatic target , the r2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase [ 149 ] .
interestingly , the chelating substructure of hydroxyurea is contained within the 1,2 - hopo domain of cpx .
we propose that the antiretroviral profile of hydroxyurea is compatible with the concept of trap .
eif5a and apoptosis of pathogenic cells cpx and def inhibit dohh , the enzyme responsible for the final step in the formation of hypusine [ 35 ] , [ 150 ] .
this posttranslationally modified amino acid has been found exclusively in eif5a , which in cells exists only in the hypusine - containing form [ 151 ] .
eif5a is expressed in lymph nodes during acute hiv - 1 infection [ 152 ] , is overexpressed in lymphocytes of hiv - infected patients [ 51 ] , and has been implicated as a cofactor for hiv - 1 replication [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 50 ] as well as a regulator of apoptosis triggered through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] .
hypusine is essential for eif5a function in hiv - 1 infection and apoptosis .
specifically , a pharmacologically [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 41 ] - [ 46 ] , [ 52 ] - [ 54 ] or genetically [ 47 ] - [ 49 ] induced defect of hypusine - containing eif5a in culture both activates apoptosis in susceptible cells [ 22 ] , [ 41 ] - [ 48 ] and inhibits infection by human [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] or feline [ 54 ] immunodeficiency virus .
although cpx and def could affect other pathways , as discussed below , our data support the view that dohh and the posttranslational modification of eif5a are the relevant targets for both drugs .
thus , the inhibition of cellular dohh by cpx or def closely correlates with each agent 's antiviral and pro - apoptotic profile ( figs. 4 , 5 , and s1b ) [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
notably , the dose - dependencies for tunel reactivity and inhibition of eif5a hydroxylation in cpx - treated h9 - hiv cells were indistinguishable ( figs. 4c,d ) : apoptotic dna fragmentation correlated positively with the accumulation of non - hydroxylated eif5a ( r = + 0.995 ; p < 0.01 ) and negatively with the depletion of hydroxylated eif5a ( r = - 0.996 ; p < 0.01 ) .
non - hydroxylated precursors of physiologically hydroxylated proteins can antagonize the biological functions of the native protein , as first reported for collagens [ 153 ] .
similarly , deoxyhypusyl - eif5a may interfere with the functions of mature eif5a and contribute to the induction of apoptosis .
apoptosis has also been linked to eif5a hydroxylation in tumor cells that lack functional p53 .
like hiv - 1 [ 51 ] , human papillomavirus ( hpv ) is associated with overexpression of hydroxylated eif5a [ 154 ] .
genetically hypusine - deficient eif5a causes caspase - dependent apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in hpv - immortalized cells [ 48 ] , which are defective for p53 expression .
cpx exerted similar effects in p53 - defective tumor cells in culture , and inhibited the growth of breast cancer xenografts in mice by selectively inducing apoptosis in the tumors [ 155 ] .
this remarkable profile corresponds closely to the pro - apoptotic activity of cpx in hiv - infected cells ( figs. 1 , 2 , 4 and 6 ) , which in mice leaves the vaginal surface layer of live cells intact despite cpx concentrations in the mm range ( fig. 8 ) .
in summary , activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in hiv - and in hpv - infected cells , triggered by cpx at concentrations that inhibit eif5a hydroxylation , emerges as a common denominator for the preferential apoptotic elimination of pathogenic , virally infected and / or neoplastic cells in culture and in animals .
iron chelation and inhibition of protein hydroxylation iron and oxygen availability have been reported to affect hiv - 1 infection in a number of studies , implicating several potential mechanisms including cell cycle effects mediated by factors such as eif5a and cdk2 [ 156 ] , [ 157 ] .
among these , viral transcriptional activation via the cellular kinases cdk2 and cdk9 and hiv - 1 tat has been extensively documented [ 158 ] .
iron chelators such as deferasirox ( exjade ( tm )) have been shown to inhibit hiv - 1 replication via this pathway [ 159 ] , [ 160 ] , and a similar mechanism may underlie the inhibition observed with dfox at supraclinical concentrations [ 161 ] - [ 163 ] .
in our experiments , however , cdk2 is not significantly inhibited by cpx or def ( hoque et al. , unpublished results ) and rna analysis argues that these chelators inhibit hiv - 1 transcription at the level of initiation rather than via the tat / p - tefb axis [ 23 ] .
furthermore , comparison of cpx and def with agent p2 ( at equimolar concentrations to cpx ) or dfox ( at clinically relevant concentrations ) indicates that metal binding is not sufficient for their antiviral and pro - apoptotic activities or for dohh inhibition ( figs. 4 , 5 and fig. s1b ) .
we conclude that cpx and def do not act exclusively by global depletion of extra - or intracellular iron , by non - specific redox functions of their chelates , or by a broad reduction in metalloenzyme activity , affecting a range of targets for a particular effect [ 164 ] .
this conclusion is consistent with the observation that protein hydroxylases do not release their non - heme iron center under turnover conditions [ 165 ] .
all protein hydroxylases display a similarly side chain - coordinated non - heme iron center contained within their active site pocket that is essential for their catalytic utilization of atmospheric oxygen .
this event produces an oxo - iron species that inserts its oxygen atom into a specific c - h bond of the substrate protein , as first described [ 26 ] and verified [ 32 ] for the prolyl 4 - hydroxylases .
accordingly , cpx and def can also inhibit the non - heme iron oxygenases required for the hydroxylation of collagens [ 35 ] and hypoxia - inducible factor ( hif ) - 1alpha ([ 166 ] , hanauske - abel , unpublished results ) .
inhibition of collagen hydroxylation decreases its secretion and tissue fibrosis [ 153 ] , [ 167 ] .
fibrosis is a hallmark of hiv - infected lymphoid tissues , limits survival and reconstitution of naive t cells [ 168 ] , and predicts the magnitude of the peripheral cd4 + cell pool achievable by cart [ 169 ] .
adjunctive use of agents that decrease collagen secretion has therefore been proposed to provide antiretroviral benefit [ 168 ] , [ 169 ] .
inhibition of hif - 1alphahydroxylation increases its stability and transcriptional activity [ 170 ] , stimulating the hiv - 1 promoter via its specific hypoxia response element [ 171 ] .
vpr , itself a pivotal stimulator of hiv - 1 expression [ 78 ] , [ 122 ] , [ 124 ] , further increases the level of hif - 1alphaand enhances hif - 1alphabinding to the hiv - 1 promoter , augmenting hiv - 1 expression [ 171 ] .
despite the presence of increased vpr levels ( fig. 3c ) , however , both protein hydroxylase inhibitors blocked hiv - 1 expression ( fig. 4b ) .
our data suggest that cpx interacts with a matching cellular element , the active site cavity of dohh .
among the iron - binding medicines and experimental compounds surveyed [ 172 ] - [ 175 ] , only cpx and def ( i ) comply with the limits for molecular volume and surface area derived from the dimensions of the dohh substrate , the deoxyhypusine side chain ; and ( ii ) meet the requirement for hydrophobic subsite interaction and directional metal - binding imposed by the active site cavity of dohh ( fig. s3 and [ 40 ]) .
the catalytic iron center of dohh enables a tertiary structure fold required for substrate binding and product formation , whereas iron removal causes marked refolding with loss of enzyme activity [ 176 ] .
cpx and def render dohh unable to bind its substrate [ 23 ] , proposed to reflect their chelating access to the iron center , its release as a chelate from the apoenzyme , tertiary structure collapse , and loss of activity , as evidenced by the accumulation of its substrate , the non - hydroxylated precursor of eif5a ( fig. 4c and fig. s1b ) .
a mechanistic hypothesis for trap and its consequences based on the data presented here and elsewhere [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , we envision the three - phase model illustrated in figure 9 .
in phase i , hiv - 1 gene expression is disrupted and production of infective virions and other viral products inhibited , at least in part due to suppression of hypusine formation in eif5a .
these events combine to limit hiv - 1 control over the survival of infected cells , leading to trap in phase ii. the ablation of infected cells diminishes hiv - 1 production sites to the point of eradication , evidenced by the lack of hiv - 1 resurgence after drug withdrawal in phase iii .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0074414.g009 figure 9 model for the antiretroviral action of ciclopirox and deferiprone via trap .
the model is based on two drug effects : ( 1 ) enhanced pro - apoptotic activity in cells , and ( 2 ) decreased viral suppression of infection - activated apoptosis due to increased viral pro - apoptotic factors and decreased viral anti - apoptotic factors .
in uninfected cells , the apoptotic threshold is decreased ( 1 ) , but they largely escape apoptosis in the absence of infection - activated apoptosis that is released from viral control by drug treatment ( 2 ) .
see text for details .
yellow boxes , cellular events ; green boxes , viral events .
events measured in this study are specified in bold within bold - lined boxes ; predicted consequences are specified in italics within thin - lined boxes .
in phase i , cpx and def inhibit dohh causing depletion of mature eif5a and accumulation of its non - hydroxylated precursor ( fig. 4c ) .
this lowers the apoptotic threshold in uninfected cells ( figs. 2a , 6c ) , consistent with the pro - apoptotic effect of hypusine inhibition .
it also blocks hiv - 1 gene expression ( fig. 4b ; [ 23 ]) , restricting both productive infection ( fig. 5 ; fig. 6a,b ) and anti - apoptotic effectors like tat [ 63 ] - [ 65 ] ( fig. 3c ) .
paradoxically , vpr increases and , consistent with its pro - apoptotic activity [ 72 ] - [ 78 ] , active caspase - 3 rises synchronously ( fig. 3c ) ; upon increase of its intracellular concentration , vpr exerts a proapoptotic instead of an anti - apoptotic function [ 71 ] .
vpr can originate from incoming virions [ 69 ] and is able to extend its own half - life independent of synthesis by manipulating the ubiquitin / proteasome pathway [ 70 ] , [ 125 ] , [ 177 ] .
this auto - regulatory activity of vpr , essential for preintegration transcription and initiation of infection [ 122 ] , [ 124 ] , [ 125 ] , [ 178 ] , is restrained by the subsequent expression of hiv - 1 proteins like vif [ 179 ] .
we therefore speculate that such feedback control over vpr is impaired by the drug - mediated suppression of hiv - 1 gene expression ( fig. 4b ) , resulting in an enhancement of vpr pro - apoptotic activity in hiv - infected cells .
although the intentional recruitment of vpr as a pharmacological activator of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is known to eliminate malignant cells [ 180 ] , [ 181 ] , it has not been conceived as a tool for combating hiv - 1 infection .
our data suggest that cpx and def may recruit vpr as a caspase - 3 activator , facilitating the apoptogenic elimination of virus - infected cells .
in phase ii , the drug - induced disruption of eif5a hydroxylation and hiv - 1 gene expression causes trap by converting the retroviral blockade of apoptosis ( fig. 1d ) into extensive and preferential death of infected cells ( fig. 6c ) .
in our concept , the drug - mediated disruption of viral regulatory mechanisms forces hiv - infected cells over the drug - lowered apoptotic threshold , resulting in depletion of the proviral reservoir .
uninfected cells need to contend solely with a lowered apoptotic threshold .
consequently , in tissue culture the majority of uninfected cells exposed to cpx or def survives , in contrast to infected cells ( figs. 1 , 2a , 6c and 8 ; ref. [ 22 ]) .
in vivo , non - pathogenic cell populations survive intact even when exposed to drug concentrations that , in the case of cpx , are orders of magnitude above those causing the death of infected cells ( fig. 8 ). by blocking retroviral gene expression ( fig. 4b ; [ 23 ]) , cpx also quenches the production of host molecules that promote immune paralysis [ 93 ] , [ 126 ] , [ 182 ] .
il - 10 disrupts virus - specific t cell responses and causes persistence of viral infection [ 183 ] , [ 184 ] .
this cytokine is induced by several retroviral proteins , e.g. tat and gp120 [ 126 ] , [ 127 ] , [ 185 ] , is an anti - apoptotic factor for t cells [ 186 ] and promotes hiv - 1 infectivity through ccr5 induction [ 187 ] .
the hiv - induced increase in il - 10 levels is not normalized by cart [ 96 ] but is completely inhibited by cpx ( fig. 6e ) .
in phase iii , the consequence of suppressed infection in phase i and of activated apoptosis in phase ii emerges as functional depletion of established virion production sites , evidenced by the absence of post - treatment resurgence ( fig. 7 ) .
resurgence of hiv - 1 rna up to or above the pretreatment set - point occurs in cell culture and in patients after interruption or termination of antiretroviral treatment [ 188 ] - [ 190 ] and has been attributed to extended survival of hiv - infected cells [ 191 ] - [ 193 ] .
phase i and phase ii emulate the two major effects of an adaptive immune response , blockade of acute infection ( by neutralizing antibodies ) and ablation of virally infected cells ( by cytotoxic lymphocytes ) , respectively ( see figs. 5 and 6 ) .
the ensuing depletion of viral production sites appears to achieve termination of previously productive infection , suggested by absent resurgence of hiv - 1 rna despite the prolonged post - treatment presence of susceptible cells ( fig. 7 ) .
in vivo , absent rebound is a rare event , achieved only by total lymphoid tissue ablation with subsequent transplantation of hiv - 1 resistant ccr5 ^ 32 /^ 32 stem cells [ 194 ] , [ 195 ] , by complementing cart with hydroxyurea [ 148 ] , or by very early start of cart [ 1 ] .
importantly , absent re - acquisition of pre - treatment hiv - 1 rna levels was also noted after def monotherapy in the proof - of - concept trial ( saxena et al. , unpublished data ) .
implications of trap : in situ formation of immunogens in addition to this immunomimetic antiretroviral side activity of cpx and def ( figs. 5 - 7 ) , we anticipate that such medicines may also display immunogenic activity in vivo .
when introduced into a host with a functioning immune system , hiv - infected pbmcs rendered apoptotic ex vivo induce hiv - 1 specific cellular and humoral responses that effectively protect against challenge with live hiv - infected cells [ 196 ] - [ 198 ] .
similarly , infected cells rendered apoptotic in situ by medicines like cpx or def , might serve as vehicles that deliver retroviral immunogens to an immune system that has , at least temporarily , been de - paralyzed by the same drugs via their ability to inhibit hiv - 1 gene expression .
such ' vaccineless vaccination ' would induce a state of stabilized hiv - 1 control that extends beyond cessation of treatment and is evidenced by prolonged suppression of hiv - 1 rna .
we propose a testable clinical scenario in which an hiv - infected patient receives medication that blocks expression of immunodisruptive viral genes [ 23 ] while activating apoptosis of infected cells ([ 22 ] and figs. 1 - 7 ) , thereby facilitating an immune response against endogenous re - emergence and exogenous re - infection .
conceptually , lack of resurgence in vivo may therefore combine drug - mediated apoptotic ablation of viral production sites with a further , post - medication decline in viral load , as noted in the proof - of - concept trial of def ( saxena et al. , unpublished data ). of note , def - treated thalassemic patients display signs of immune activation and are able to launch immune responses against previously unrecognized epitopes [ 199 ] .
implications of trap : drug development and clinical exploration trap offers a novel framework for the development and proof - of - principle testing of antiviral medicines .
trap bridges the traditional barrier between pharmacological and immunological modes of fighting viral infections .
trap - triggering low - molecular weight medicines can preferentially kill productively infected lymphocytic cells ( figs. 1 , 2 , 6 ; refs .
[ 22 ] , [ 128 ] , [ 130 ]) and macrophages [ 7 ] , and possibly latently infected cells [ 137 ] .
trap effects can be investigated directly in patients , bypassing the deficiencies of experimental models for human infection , a severe constraint on antiretroviral drug development .
since hiv - 1 transmission occurs via mucosal or intravenous routes and particularly affects populations with established indications for administration of cpx or def , the trap profiles of these drugs can be tested by hypothesis - directed side effect monitoring in hiv - infected patients who use these medicines as directed and indicated for unrelated therapeutic benefit .
we envision two populations for such monitoring studies : hiv - positive thalassemic patients who , requiring life - long transfusions and thus exposed to several blood - borne viruses , became iatrogenically infected and are receiving oral def ( e.g. ferriprox ( tm )) as therapeutically indicated decorporation agent .
in resource - limited epidemic settings , hiv - 1 infection of such patients is frequent and eventually may affect every fourth child born with thalassemia [ 200 ] - [ 203 ] .
at least one case report on a thalassemic patient suggests that def displays antiretroviral activity in vivo [ 204 ] , although the drug had not been prescribed for this purpose .
hiv - positive women who suffer from vulvovaginal candidiasis and receive topical cpx ( batrafen ( tm )) as therapeutically indicated antifungal agent .
candidiasis causes significant increases of the hiv - 1 copy number in cervicovaginal secretions , even in women who test negative for hiv - 1 rna in plasma [ 205 ] .
due to the absent induction of resistant yeast species , which sets cpx and its analog rilopirox apart from azole and polyene antifungals [ 114 ] , [ 206 ] , [ 207 ] , and due to its inherent antiretroviral activity , cpx is predicted to suppress vaginal shedding of infectious virions in a manner superior to azoles and polyenes .
recent studies indicate that cpx may no longer be an exclusively topical medicine .
its systemic application has shown promise in patients with hematologic malignancies , in particular acute myelogenous leukemia [ 208 ] , [ 209 ] .
in culture , cpx markedly decreases several proteins that protect malignant cells against apoptosis , among them survivin [ 210 ] and hsp27 ( memin et al. , submitted ) .
both proteins are also induced by hiv - 1 , ensuring survival of infected cells [ 211,212 ] .
our further studies will focus on this convergence in pathogenic , i.e. malignant or hiv - infected cells .
the medicines investigated here as antiretroviral pioneer drugs are widely used and considered safe for their approved human applications .
they modulate infection by hiv - 1 in culture , and def shows activity in infected individuals ( saxena et al. , unpublished data ) .
these facts do not , however , elevate these medicines into the category of antiretrovirals : extensive clinical studies have to be completed .
our data suggest that cpx and def can serve as the basic structures for chemical optimizations to achieve trap by dedicated cytocidal antivirals .
the transformation of the antiviral and pro - apoptotic side activities of existing drugs into the main activity of a cytocidal antiviral can be guided by their steric parameters and structure - activity relation [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ( fig. 4 and fig. s3 ) , and by the steric coordinates of their bona fide cellular targets , which for cpx and def appear to be the active sites and catalytic events of non - heme iron protein hydroxylases [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 26 ] - [ 29 ] , [ 40 ] .
conclusions two structurally distinct drugs , the antifungal ciclopirox and the chelator deferiprone , inhibit hiv - 1 gene expression and activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis preferentially in infected cells .
in contrast to current antiretrovirals , these medications therefore terminate the infection by hiv - 1 of human lymphocytes in culture .
this finding suggests a general strategy for combating hiv / aids and potentially other infections : the therapeutic reclamation of apoptotic proficiency .

mouse model for cervicovaginal toxicity of cpx as described previously [ 111 ] , 10 week old female cf - 1 mice ( harlan ; indianapolis , in ) received 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate ( mpa ) administered subcutaneously to induce superficial mucification of the vagina , i.e. a surface layer of vital columnar instead of dead cornified cells .
five days after injection , three groups of ten animals each were formed .
animals in groups a and b received 20 microl 1 % batrafen vaginalcreme ( tm ) containing 28.8 mm total and 0.6 mm bioavailable cpx on four consecutive days .
animals in group c ( controls ) received 20 microl phosphate buffered saline on four consecutive days .
all animals were then challenged by vaginal inoculation with hsv - 2 , the animals in groups a and c receiving high - dose ( 10 id50 ) and those in group b low - dose ( 0.1 id50 ) inoculum .
vaginal lavages from all animals were obtained three days after inoculation and assayed for viral shedding using an anti - hsv - 2 fitc - conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody for direct fluorescence detection of hsv - 2 antigen expression ( bartels ( tm ) herpes simplex virus type - specific fluorescent monoclonal antibody test ; trinity biotech , bray , ireland ) in cell cultures inoculated with the vaginal lavages .

figure s2 analysis of the dilutional effect of the replenishment protocol on retroviral copy number in the long - term pbmc cultures .
we computationally analyzed the potentially confounding effect of the replenishment protocol developed for the long - term pbmc cultures on the results obtained in the long - term pbmc cultures infected with patient isolates .
on alternate days , the cultures were replenished with medium and pbmcs freshly isolated from hiv - uninfected hla - diverse volunteers .
replenishment of these multi - donor mixed lymphocyte cultures was required to meet cell decay and nutritional demands in the productively infected controls .
the cultures generated extraordinarily high levels of infectious hiv (>= 106 copies / ml ) that have only been observed in moribund aids patients .
cell proliferation kinetics in mixed lymphocyte cultures from two hla - diverse individuals are complex due to differential survival of stimulator / responder and daughter subpopulations , the modifying impact of initial cell number , etc .
in our system , this complexity is multiplied by the necessity to rely on pbmcs from multiple hla - diverse individuals and by the presence of both a viral infection and a drug .
we do not know of any methodology that could deconvolute the differential survival and kinetics of the multitudes of subpopulations in these cultures .
viral propagation is the key parameter of our study , however , and the impact of replenishment can be assessed mathematically at the level of hiv - 1 copy number .
our model is based on the replenishment parameters ( frequency , volume , etc. ) and the observation that 30 microm cpx ( the concentration maintained throughout the 38 - day treatment period ) completely blocks virion generation in infected pbmcs ( figs. 5b and 6b ) .
the viral copy number at the start of cpx treatment is therefore ' frozen ' and subject only to change by dilution and decay .
ignoring decline by decay , change by dilution can be calculated and represents a high - end estimate for the fall in virion number .
this computational model indicates that medium replenishment by itself ( in the absence of viral replication and decay ) will dilute viral copy number from over 2x106 copies / ml on day 1 of cpx to the limit of hiv - 1 rna detectability ( about 200 copies / ml ) by day 23 and to less than 0.01 copies / ml on day 38 of cpx ( shown in blue ) .
the experimentally determined virion numbers ( shown in red ) deviate markedly from this model .
within the first days on cpx , a gap that widens over time places the measurements significantly above , but not at or below , those modeled as representing the dilutional decline in viral copies .
thus , the replenishment protocol does not by itself result in a dilution of the virus sufficient to cause lack of hiv - 1 rebound after drug withdrawal .

figure s3 inhibitor domains and active site organization of dohh. a. computationally derived geometric dimensions of peptide - bound hypusine , ciclopirox and agent p2 .
the oxygen atom at c9 of hypusine reveals the position of the non - heme iron ( blue circle ) that is essential for its generation and for coordination of the inhibitors .
the deoxyhypusine substrate of dohh displays the same conformation as hypusine , but lacks the oxygen atom at c9 ( not shown ) .
molecules are depicted as tube models in energetically minimized conformation and conventionally colored ( gray , carbon ; red , oxygen ; blue , nitrogen ; white , hydrogen ) .
the green double arrows specify the largest intercarbon distance within the hydrophobic substructures of the hypusine residue and ciclopirox .
the van der waals - based cavitand contour around ciclopirox approximates the van der waals - based shape of the hypusine residue and fits the proposed dimensions of the active site pocket of dohh [ 40 ] .
white arrows identify oxygen atom - mediated bidentate chelation .
within the active site cavity of dohh , the hydrophobic cyclohexyl moiety of cpx locates to the site of the hydrophobic ( ch2 ) 4 - segment in the lysyl domain of the substrate .
the scheme on the right indicates that ciclopirox shares two functionally discernable domains , one for hydrophobic anchorage ( green ) and one for coordinative anchorage ( blue ) , whose alignment meets the directional metal - binding requirements imposed by the active site cavity of dohh [ 40 ] .
only the coordinative domain occurs in the chelation homolog agent p2 , which despite the electronically and spectroscopically identical metal binding moiety ( figs. 4a and s1a ) is distinctly less inhibitory for dohh in vitro ( fig. s1b ) .
only the stereochemistry of the cpx domains for hydrophobic ( green ) and for coordinative anchorage ( blue ) conforms with the experimentally derived model for the active site architecture of dohh [ 40 ]. b. computational analysis of cpx , agent p2 , def , and the dohh substrate side chain .
steric parameters were calculated with spartan ( tm ) ( wavefunction inc. , irvine , ca ) .
surface area , volume , and surface area / volume ratio of cpx differ from those of the deoxyhypusine substrate by <= 4 % , whereas those of agent p2 differ by as much as 47 % .

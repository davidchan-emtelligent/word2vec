abnormal methylation of certain cancer related genes strongly predicts a diagnosis of head and neck cancer ( hnc ) , while the predictive power of methylation of other dna markers for hnc remains unclear .
to systemically assess the diagnostic value of dna methylation patterns for hnc and the effect of methylation platform techniques and sample types , we performed a pubmed search for studies of the correlation between dna methylation and hnc completed before july 2016 , and extracted the sensitivity and specificity for methylated biomarkers .
across these studies , dna methylation showed high sensitivity for diagnosing hnc in solid tissue ( 0.57 ) , and high specificity in saliva ( 0.89 ) .
area under the curve ( auc ) from summary receiver operating characteristic ( sroc ) curves revealed that dna methylation had more diagnostic power in solid tissue ( auc = 0.82 ) than saliva ( auc = 0.80 ) or blood ( auc = 0.77 ) .
combinations of multiple methylated genes were more sensitive diagnostic markers than single methylated genes .
our results suggest that the diagnostic accuracy of methylated biomarkers for hnc varied by sample type and were most accurate when results from multiple sample types were considered .
head and neck cancer dna methylation diagnostic accuracy biopsy type meta - analysis introduction for this study , we selected from the literature reports of common squamous - cell carcinomas of the oral cavity , pharynx , and larynx ( hscc ) , which account for 90 % of hnc [ 1 ] .
approximately 650,000 cases of hnc are identified per year [ 2 ] and the disease has high recurrence rates and poor prognoses due to distant metastasis [ 3 ] .
late diagnosis results in poorer prognosis [ 4 ] .
improved diagnostic accuracy for hnc could lead to earlier diagnosis , increasing patient survival rates .
variations in the epigenetic modifications , such as dna methylation in gene promoters , often inhibit gene transcription and protein translation , important factors in human carcinogenesis .
a number of genes are frequently methylated in hnc , including p16 , dapk1 , and rassf1a [ 5 , 6 ] , or hypermethylated in cpg islands , such as hmlh1 [ 7 ] , kif1a , and ednrb [ 8 ] .
many groups have identified abnormally methylated genes as hnc diagnostic biomarkers but their predictive accuracies fluctuated among different sample types .
moreover , there are no systematic diagnostic accuracy studies or meta - analyses regarding the various sample types in hnc .
we performed a systematic review and stratified meta - analysis of previous hnc studies based on sample types and diagnostic markers .
we aim to provide more reliable evidence to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of dna methylation markers , according to published reports that computed sensitivity and specificity .
results study characteristics we identified 108 papers in a search of the pubmed database .
seventy - nine were excluded based on screening the title and abstract , including twenty - eight papers that did not involve hnc , thirty - six papers that did not investigate the cancer diagnoses , eleven papers that did not include a diagnosis based on dna methylation , and four reviews .
we obtained the full texts of twenty - nine papers ; of these five further papers were excluded , including two studies that did not show the sensitivity and specificity of the methylation biomarkers in a hnc diagnosis and three studies that only investigated the diagnosis of recurrence .
we identified 183 studies from the remaining twenty - four articles [ 8 - 31 ] ( figure 1 ) .
in addition , we added 20 articles including 25 studies to our analysis from a review [ 32 - 51 ] .
these studies were conducted in fifteen countries or regions ( including the usa , brazil , china , hong kong , japan , australia , sweden , egypt , thailand , india , taiwan , hungary , turkish , french and italy ) and were published between 2002 and 2016 .
the sample sizes of these studies ranged from 31 - 597 patients , with a mean of 115 .
figure 1 flow chart showing the study retrieval process the diagnostic accuracy of selected methylated genes was extracted from the included papers and grouped by sample type tested .
ten papers used saliva [ 9 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 17 , 27 , 29 , 32 , 50 ] , sixteen papers used solid tissue [ 11 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 19 , 23 - 26 , 30 , 31 , 33 - 38 , 40 - 46 , 49 ] , four papers used blood [ 21 , 28 , 31 , 39 ] , five papers used both solid tissue and saliva [ 8 , 13 , 22 , 47 , 51 ] , and two papers used both solid tissue and blood ( table 1 ) [ 20 , 33 ] .
the studies evaluated the diagnostic power of methylation biomarkers as follows : thirty - five studies were based on a single gene [ 8 , 12 - 14 , 16 - 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 - 28 , 30 , 32 - 51 ] , two papers were based on multiple genes [ 9 , 22 ] and seven papers were based on both single and multiple genes [ 10 , 11 , 15 , 20 , 24 , 29 , 31 ] .
the details of methylated biomarkers and their diagnostic powers are shown in supplementary table 1 .

exploration of heterogeneity analysis to determine the effect model of diagnostic accuracy , we conducted heterogeneity tests for plr , nlr , and dor and found a significant heterogeneity of nlr in the solid tissue and saliva studies ( table 2 ) .
dor showed no heterogeneity in the solid tissue or blood studies .
plr showed low heterogeneity in the solid tissue studies and no heterogeneity in the saliva or blood studies .
the heterogeneity of nlr varied among the sample types .

q and p - value were the q value and p value of cochran 's q test .
we used meta - regression analysis to assess whether publication year , sample type , dna methylation detection technique , or the methylation panel corresponding to single or multiple methylated biomarkers affected the diagnostic accuracy for hnc .
the true and false positive rates were used as the responses in meta - regression analyses .
as shown in table 3 , the p values of sensitivity and false positive rates were not significant , suggesting that publication year , biomarker technique , and sample types did not affect the false positive rate .

meta - analysis was performed separately for the saliva , solid tissue , and blood samples .
dna methylation detected from saliva samples had an overall sensitivity and specificity for hnc diagnosis of 0.47 ( 95 % ci : 0.39 - 0.55 ) and 0.89 ( 95 % ci : 0.85 - 0.91 ) , respectively ( figure 2a ) .
in solid tissue samples the overall sensitivity and specificity were 0.57 ( 95 % ci : 0.50 - 0.63 ) and 0.88 ( 95 % ci : 0.84 - 0.9 ) , respectively ( figure 2b ) .
blood samples provided the lowest overall sensitivity at 0.46 ( 95 % ci : 0.32 - 0.61 ) , and overall specificity of 0.85 ( 95 % ci : 0.77 - 0.91 , figure 2c ) .

in addition , we evaluated the diagnostic power based on the types of methylation biomarkers .
the single methylation markers had overall sensitivity and specificity of 0.51 ( 95 % ci : 0.45 - 0.57 ) and 0.87 ( 95 % ci : 0.84 - 0.90 ) , respectively .
the diagnostic sensitivity of multiple methylation markers was 0.55 ( 95 % ci : 0.47 - 0.63 ) and the specificity was 0.88 ( 95 % ci : 0.85 - 0.90 ) .
in general , methylated biomarkers showed differential diagnostic accuracy in all three sample types , and the diagnostic power of integrating multiple methylated genes was better than with a single gene .
according to the sensitivity and specificity results from each trial , the regression coefficients of the sroc curves were near 0 for the three sample types ( table 4 ) .
the auc curve indicated that samples from solid tissue had the highest diagnostic accuracy , with an auc value of 0.82 ( figure 3 ) and a q * metric of 0.81 ( 95 % ci : 0.77 - 0.85 ) , whereas the sensitivity was identical to the specificity ( table 4 , figure 3 ) .
in addition , the panel of multiple methylated genes showed higher auc value than a single methylated gene ( 0.85 vs. 0.77 ) .
these results suggest that the combination of multiple methylation biomarkers in solid tissue has better diagnostic accuracy , with higher sensitivity in saliva , which could be useful for hnc screening .

figure 3 sroc curves of studies relating to the detection of hnc in different biopsy types publish bias and sensitivity analysis the risk of bias for each study was first assessed ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
as shown in figure 4 , 92 % of studies showed a low or unclear risk of bias for many bias items and only 5 ~ 18 % of studies clearly reported a non - random sequence generation , no blinding , or incomplete blinding .
more than 50 % of the studies had independent data collection , assessment of dna methylation , and interpretation of outcomes .
in total , 75 % of the studies show the sensitivities and specificities for all of the evaluated methylation biomarkers , which suggested no selective reporting .
ten studies were reported to be free of other sources of bias .
based on these metrics we deemed the quality of the studies included in the following meta - analysis to be acceptable .
figure 4 risk of bias graph two authors independently evaluated the items of bias .
if the study reported all of the sensitivities and specificities of genes that were measured dna methylation status , selective reporting was defined as low risk. by testing the relationship between the dor and its standard error , we assessed the publication bias effects of the sample size for each diagnostic consequence .
the potential publication bias was ascertained in these studies using symmetrical funnel plots for the saliva , solid tissue , and blood samples .
we found that some studies corresponding to saliva ( figure 5a ) or solid tissue ( figure 5b ) were not inside the funnel .
begg 's testing demonstrated that there was no significant publication bias in the three sample types from hnc patients .
the studies with smaller sample sizes did not tend towards higher levels of accuracy .

a one - way sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the robustness of the results of this meta - analysis with respect to study and biomarker .
the pooled specificity was not influenced when removing one study or diagnostic biomarker ( supplementary table 2 , 3 ) .
the sensitivity was increased when the studies by carvalho et al. and adams et al. were excluded , and was decreased when the study by arantes et al. was excluded ( supplementary table 2 ) .
the exclusion of individual methylated markers had no effect on diagnostic sensitivity .
discussion dna methylation has previously been demonstrated to be a potentially useful marker for multiple cancers [ 52 ] .
abnormally methylated regions in cancer - related genes such as rassf1a [ 24 ] , p16 [ 53 ] , rar - beta [ 24 ] , and mgmt [ 54 ] , provide adequate sensitivity and specificity for the detection of hnc .
other abnormally methylated genes have shown inconsistent diagnostic accuracy for hnc .
for example , the sensitivity of p16 for diagnosing hnc varied from 44.6 % to 100 % [ 19 , 55 ] .
in this study , we analyzed the accuracy of methylated genes for diagnosing hnc based on previously published studies .
overall , the sensitivity of the dna methylation was 0.47 in saliva , 0.57 in solid tissue and 0.46 in blood , and the specificity was 0.89 , 0.88 and 0.85 , respectively .
we found that dna methylation had low sensitivity but high specificity in the diagnosis of hnc .
different samples showed similar specificity but differential sensitivity .
seven papers corresponding to eleven studies were used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of dna methylation in blood .
the small number of studies may provide misleading conclusions on the diagnostic power in blood that should be further evaluated .
moreover , testing for multiple methylated genes showed higher sensitivity than single methylated genes .
ideally , we should assess the overall diagnostic accuracy of the same combinations of methylated genes or single genes in three different sample types , but were limited by the number of studies available in the literature .
we provide detailed information on the combinations of multiple methylated genes in figure 2 .
behind each author 's name is the applicable dna methylation marker information for the specific study .
the evidence from this study suggests that dna methylation biomarkers might be effective tools for detecting hnc .
it should also be noted that the diagnostic accuracy of dna methylation depends on the sample type and diagnostic markers studied .
many of the studies in our analysis detected dna methylation based on methylation - specific pcr ( msp ) , one of the principle methods of investigating dna methylation .
msp typically overestimates the extent of methylation , which would affect the diagnosis of hnc .
we studied whether the assay method of dna methylation affects the hnc diagnosis , but found no significant differences among these methods .
materials and methods data sources and search strategy we searched for diagnostic studies in pubmed published before july 2016 .
the search strategy for pubmed was (" head and neck neoplasms " [ mesh terms ] or " head and neck cancer " [ all fields ]) and (" sensitivity and specificity "[ mesh terms ] or " sensitivity and specificity " [ all fields ] and (" dna methylation " [ mesh terms ] or " dna methylation " [ all fields ]) to find appropriate studies published in english prior to july 25 , 2016 .
we searched for published trials that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of one or more methylated biomarkers .
in addition , we added all studies included in a previous meta - analysis into our analysis [ 56 ] .
study selection two reviewers independently filtered the search results by the title and abstract .
studies were excluded if they did not pertain to dna methylation , were not related to hnc , were not diagnostic studies , or were reviews .
two authors obtained the full text of each paper and further filtered out the studies that did not supply sensitivity or specificity data for hnc diagnosis or that concerned the diagnosis of recurrence .
we collected the authors' names ; institutions ; publication dates ; sample types , including saliva , solid tissue , and blood ; methylated biomarkers ; and techniques of dna methylation detection for all of the studies .
all studies were evaluated independently and discussed by the authors until any inconsistencies were resolved .
data extraction and quality assessment a standardized data extraction form was used to extract the information from each paper including the first author , year of publication , country in which the study was performed , number of cases and controls , sample types , methylated gene names , dna methylation detection techniques , number of methylated genes used as diagnostic biomarkers , and records of true positive , false positive , true negative and false negative results in head and neck cancer .
simultaneously , we evaluated the risk of bias according to pre - specified criteria from the cochrane collaboration 's tool for assessing the risk of bias [ 57 ] .
the two authors independently checked the risk of bias assessment for each trial using standardized methods including the following ( supplementary table 4 ) : whether a study showed selection bias including sequencing generation and allocation concealment ; whether the performance was biased regarding the blinding of patients and study personnel ; whether the detection was biased according to the assessment of the blinding of the outcome ; and whether the attrition and reporting were biased by being based on incomplete outcome data and selective reporting , respectively .
data synthesis and statistical analysis we extracted the number of true positive ( tp ) , false positive ( fp ) , true negative ( tn ) and false negative ( fn ) results based on the remaining studies .
the summary effects of the positive likelihood ratio ( plr ) , negative likelihood ratio ( nlr ) , diagnostic odds ratio ( dor ) , and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) were further computed to estimate the statistical heterogeneities through cochran 's q test , that approximately follows a chi2 distribution with k - 1 degrees of freedom ( where k is the number of included studies ) [ 58 ] .
we assessed i2 = (( q - ( k - 1 ))/ q ) x100 % , which ranged from 0 - 100 % .
i2 represents different degrees of heterogeneity , including low ( 0 - 25 %) , moderate ( 25 - 50 %) , high ( 50 - 75 %) and very high ( 75 - 100 %) [ 58 ] .
the p value of the heterogeneity test determined whether a fixed - or random - effects model was used to estimate the diagnostic effects , and the significance level of heterogeneity was considered to be 0.05 .
the overall sensitivity and specificity were estimated to represent the diagnostic power of dna methylation for the detection of head and neck cancer .
for the overall diagnostic accuracy , an sroc curve was generated based on the sensitivity and specificity of each study using the equation d = a + bxs , where d = logit ( se ) - logit ( 1 - sp ) = log ( or ) and s = logit ( se ) + logit ( 1 - sp ) [ 59 ] .
in the regression equation , d represents the diagnostic power of the methylated biomarkers , and s represents the threshold of the classification between positive and negative .
because the parameters d and s are from different studies , the values of the regression coefficient closer to 0 suggested less significant heterogeneity in various studies , which corresponds to diagnostic accuracy .
the area under the sroc curve ( auc ) value was estimated to measure the overall diagnostic power of dna methylation in individual studies .
in addition , q * = se = 1 - sp was computed according to the regression equation of sroc , where se = exp ( a / 2 )/[ 1 + exp ( a / 2 )] and 1 - sp = 1 /[ 1 + exp ( a / 2 )] , which suggested that the diagnostic threshold for a correct diagnosis was constant for all of the subjects .
publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot analyses and begg 's and egger 's tests , with a significance level defined as 0.01 .
we used the mada and metafor package in r to performed the statistical analysis [ 60 ] .

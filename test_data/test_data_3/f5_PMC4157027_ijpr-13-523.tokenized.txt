several complications attributed with herpes virus related infections and the emergence of drug resistant viruses prompt scientists to search for new drugs .
several terpenoids and coumarins have shown anti hsv effects while no sesquiterpene coumarins have been previously tested for hsv treatment .
three sesquiterpene coumarins badrakemin acetate ( 1 ) , kellerin ( 2 ) and samarcandin diastereomer ( 3 ) were isolated from the gum resin of ferula assa - foetida , a herbal medicine with antimicrobial , antiprotozoal and antiviral effects .
compounds were identified by 1d and 2d - nmr spectroscopies and comparison with literature data .
a comparative evaluation of cytotoxicity and antiviral activity showed that kellerin ( 2 ) could significantly inhibit the cytopathic effects and reduce the viral titre of the herpes virus type 1 ( hsv - 1 ) dna viral strain kos at concentrations of 10 , 5 and 2.5 microg / ml. key words kellerin badrakemin acetate samarcandin diastereomer ferula assa - foetida herpes simplex introduction hsv - related opportunistic infections are involved in the development of various malignancies , and there is a growing need to find new antiviral compounds to address the emergency of drug - resistant viral strains and to improve the efficacy and tolerability of our current antiviral armoury ( 1 - 2 ) , that , in the case of herpes virus , include both nucleoside analogues ( acyclovir ) and non - nucleoside hsv - inhibitors ( 3 ) .
several studies have shown the potential of herbal medicine to afford new antiviral leads that can inhibit viral replication , viral genome synthesis , or both processes ( 4 - 5 ) .
remarkably , several isoprenoids show antiviral activity against type 1 or 2 herpes virus ( 6 - 9 ) , sometimes comparable to that of acyclovir , the golden standard of the field ( 10 ) .
the potent activity of many sesquiterpene coumarins toward several strains of influenza virus ( 11 ) and rhinoviruses ( 12 ) has prompted us to extend these studies to their anti - herpetic action , focusing on asafoetida as a source of these compounds .
asafoetida is the gum resin obtained by incision of the collar of roots of several ferula spp ( apiaceae ) characterized by foul smell .
asafetida has been extensively investigated from a phytochemical standpoint , and sesquitepene coumarin ethers ( 13 - 14 ) , sesquiterpenes ( 15 - 16 ) and sulphides ( 17 - 18 ) have emerged as its hallmark constituents .
sesquiterpene coumarins such as , assafoetidnol a , assafoetidnol b , gummosin , polyanthin , badrakemin , neveskone , samarcandin , galbanic acid ( 13 ) , 5 - hydroxyumbelliprenin , 8 - hydroxyumbelliprenin and 8 - acetoxyumbelliprenin ( 14 ) have been previously reported from the plant , mostly from samples far away from original place of the plant .
since asafoetida is a commercial umbrella name that lacks a specific botanical connection , it is difficult to assign the occurrence of the various compounds to a particular ferula species .
to overcome this limitation , we have started a systematic study of various foul - smelling gum resins obtained from botanical collections of iranian ferula species , trying to bridge the gap between the existence of multiple botanical sources for commercial asafetida and the occurrence of a specific phytochemical pattern and bioactivity profile in its various plant sources .
although complicated by the likely occurrence of chemotypes , we feel this approach is a prerequisite for a better exploitation of the biomedical profile of asafetida and the establishment of a botanically certified supply chain of the product .
we present here the results obtained with the gum - resin of f. assa - foetida , focusing on its sesquiterpene coumarin profile and their antiviral activity .
the exudates from this plant is locally known as " anghuzeh " , " heng " and " buganeh " , and has traditionally been used for a bewildering range of ailments ( epilepsy , urinary , gasterointestinal and respiratory infections ) , as well as an aphrodisiac ( 19 - 20 ) , an emmenagogue ( 21 ) , and to treat snake and insects bites ( 22 ) , with the best documented folk use being the management of intestinal worm infections .
the growing interest for the antiviral activity of natural products and effectiveness of sesquiterpene coumarins on some viral infections ( 11 ) provided a rationale for focusing on this end - point .
experimental general instruments high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) was performed on a waters ( r ) apparatus equipped with a pump module 600 and a dual wavelength ( 254 , 366 nm ) uv detector using shimpack ( r ) si 20 x 250 columns .
the nmr spectra were recorded on a brucker ( r ) ( 400 mhz ) instrument , using cdcl3 as solvent .
homonuclear 1h connectivities were determined by the cosy experiment .
one - bond heteronuclear 1h - 13c connectivities were determined with the hsqc experiment. through - space 1h connectivities were established using roesy experiments with a mixing time of 300 ms. two - and three - bond 1h - 13c connectivities were determined by gradient 2d hmbc experiments optimized for 2,3j = 7.7 hz. ms analysis was obtained on an agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ( agilent technologies , palo alto , ca , usa ) coupled to an agilent mass hunter workstation b.01.03 .
silica gel in different particle sizes was used for gravity column chromatography .
tlc plates ( silica gel 60 gf254 precoated plates , merck ) were revealed by uv observation at 254 and 365 nm , and by spraying with cerium sulfate / molybdate .
all reagent solid material and solvents were purchased from merck ( germany ) .
plant material the gum - resin of ferula assa - foetida was collected by an incision of the plant root in toghrol jerd region , kerman , iran , in may 2011 at an altitude of 2200 m above sea level .
the plant was identified by dr. mohammad - reza kanani , department of biology , medicinal plants and drugs research institute , shahid beheshti university , tehran , iran , and compared to voucher specimen of the source plant ( no. mph - 1251 ) deposited at aforementioned institute .
extraction and isolation of compounds the gum resin ( 140 g ) was dried in dark , and then extracted with hexane ( 2 x 0.9 l , constant stirring for two days ) to remove the non - polar constituents .
the defatted material was then extracted with meoh ( 2 x 1 l ) , in which after evaporation at reduced pressure yielded 79 g of a reddish resinous residue , part of which ( 10 g ) was partitioned between aqueous methanol ( 40 ml water in 140 ml meoh ) and n - hexane ( 100 ml ) .
the polar phase was evaporated and fractionated by gravity column chromatography on silica gel , using a heptane - etoac gradient .
further purification of the primary fractions was achieved by normal phase hplc to get 1 ( 3 mg , heptane - etoac 1:1 ) , 2 ( 48 mg , heptane - etoac 3:7 ) and 3 ( 8 mg ) ( figure 1 ) .

antiviral evaluation cells and viruses and viral infections african green monkey kidney cells ( vero cell line ccl - 81 - atcc ) were grown in eagle minimum essential medium ( mem ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal calf serum ( fcs ) ( gibco ) , 100 u ml - 1 penicillin ( gibco ) and 100 mg ml - 1 streptomycin ( gibco ) , 2 mm l - glutamine ( gibco ) and 1mm sodium pyruvate ( gibco ) .
a virus stock of herpes simplex virus type i , strain kos ( university of isfahan / iran ) was prepared,in which vero cells infected at a low multiplicity of infection , incubated for 4 days and virus containing supernatant was harvested every day after infection until 4 days .
evaluation of cytotoxicity the different concentrations of the isolated compounds were prepared and tested in the antiviral experiments .
the solutions were prepared by dissolving the extracts in dmso at sub toxic concentration ( maximum of 0.019 %) .
to assess the effect of compounds 1 , 2 and 3 on uninfected vero cells , dilutions ranging from 2.5 , 5 , 10 microg / ml in the maintenance medium , were added to vero monolayers ( using a 96 - well microplate with 4.0x104 cells per well ) .
after 72 h of incubation at 37 c , cytotoxicity was determined by xtt proliferation assay kit ( roche , germany ) according to the instruction ( 23 ) .
all assays were carried out in triplicate .
antiviral activity anti - hsv activity was investigated using plaque forming assay .
dilutions of the extracts at concentrations of 10 and 5 and 2.5 microg / ml were added on confluent 24 h old monolayer of vero cells grown in microtitre tissue culture plates just before virus inoculation .
the cell monolayer was infected with 25 pfu of hsv1 and incubated at 37 c for 2 hours .
the infected cells were washed and overlaid with medium supplemented with 2.5 % methylcellulose and different concentrations of extract .
0.1 % dmso was used as negative control .
after 3 - 4 days , the overlay medium was removed and the cell monolayer was stained at room temperature .
finally , cell monolayer was fixed with 3.7 % formalin for 5 min and visible plaques were counted after staining with 1 % crystal violet .
the antiviral activity was determined by the following formula : percentage of inhibition = 1 - number of plaquetestednumber of plaquecontrolx100 the minimal concentration of extracts required to suppress the formation of virus plaque number by 50 % ( ic50 ) was calculated by regression analysis of the dose response curve generated from data ( 24 ) .
results and discussion a combination of open column chromatography and hplc of the defatted meoh extract of the oleo - gum - resin of ferula assa - foetida , resulted in the isolation of three sesquiterpene coumarins , namely kellerin ( 1 ) , badrakemin acetate ( 2 ) and samarcandin diastereomer ( 3 ) ( figure 1 ) .
the structures of known compounds were confirmed by direct comparison of their spectral data ( 1h nmr , 13c nmr and dept ) with those reported in literature .
as an instance , the structure elucidation of compound 2 is discussed here .
regarding 1h nmr spectrum of compound 2 , proton signals of umbelliferone part appeared at deltah 6.25 ( h - 3 ) , 7.65 ( h - 4 ) , 7.38 ( h - 5 ) , 6.86 ( h - 6 ) and 6.82 ppm ( h - 8 ) .
analysis of its 13c nmr spectrum ( cdcl3 , table 1 ) revealed the presence of 25 carbons , nine related to coumarin moiety including lactone carbonyl deltac 161.2 ppm ( c - 2 ) , fifteen carbons related to sesquiterpene moiety and one for acetate ester at deltac 170.5 .
dept 90 and 135degrees analysis showed five methyls , four aliphatic methylenes , eight methines including coumarin carbons at deltac 113.3 ( c - 3 ) , deltac 143.4 ( c - 4 ) , deltac 128.8 ( c - 5 ) , deltac 112.8 ( c - 6 ) , deltac 101.1 ( c - 8 ) and one primary alcoholic methylene at deltac 67.6 ( c - 11 ') .
there were no olefinic methylenes .
the sesquiterpene moiety was determined from the primary alcohol protons at deltah 4.17 ( h - 11'a ) and 4.46 ( h - 11'b ) , the geminal proton to ester group at deltah 4.62 ( h - 3 ' , s ) and four methyl groups at deltah 1.36 ( h - 12 ' , s ) , 0.89 ( h - 13 ' , s ) , 0.93 ( h - 14 ' , s ) and 1.32 ( h - 15 ' , s ) .
all the proton resonances were then associated to those of the relevant carbon atoms by 2d hsqc experiment .
the 1h - 1h cosy spectrum showed that the methine proton at deltah 4.62 ( h - 3 ') is coupled to the methylene at deltah 1.69 ( h - 2 ') .
the inspection of 2,3jh,c hmbc spectrum helped us to determine different moieties connectivity .
in particular , the proton at deltah 4.62 ( h - 3 ') showed long - range correlations with the carbon resonances at deltac 170.5 ( c - 1 ") , which clearly places the acetate moiety at c - 3 ' .
besides , there was a long range correlation between tertiary carbon at deltac 57.8 ( c - 9 ') and two methyls at deltah 1.32 ( h - 15 ') and 1.36 ( h - 12 ') .
the relative stereochemistry of the chiral centers could be established by examining the various cross peaks in the roesy spectrum , fig. 2. the roesy experiment supported the proposed stereochemistry .
h - 2'ax showed cross - peaks with h - 14'ax , h - 15'ax , and h - 1'eq. besides , h - 5'ax exhibited cross - peaks with h - 13'eq , h - 1'ax , and h - 9'eq , but no correlation was seen between h - 9'eq and h - 5'ax , which would propose alpha equatorial position for h - 9 ' ( figure 2 ) .
furthermore , methyl group protons of the acetyl group appear at unusually high field , in which this diamagnetic shift could only be seen due to the screening effect of the coumarin ring when ch2 - oar group is axially oriented ( 25 ) .
figure 2 selective noe correlations of compound 2 ( kellerin ) .
compound 2 could not affect the viability of vero cells as evaluated by the xtt assay .
results showed that kellerin had no cytotoxic effect up to the concentration of 10 microg / ml ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 cytotoxic activity of compound 2 .
cytotoxicity on vero cells were measured by xtt assay .
data are expressed as means +/ - standard deviations ( p < 0.05 ) .
the antiviral activity of all compounds isolated was evaluated by plaque reduction assay .
among the isolated compounds , only compound 2 could reduce the viral titre of the hsv - 1 dna viral strains kos at concentrations of 10 , 5 and 2.5 microg / ml ( table 2 ) .
this effect on hsv - 1 replication was quantified through the reduction of the infectious titre after several rounds of multiplication .
results showed that at the concentration of 10 , 5 and 2.5 microg / l , compound 2 inhibited hsv - 1 multiplications with an inhibition rate of 98 +/ - 5.2 % , 80 % and 65 % , respectively .
kellerin was effective in ec50 as 38 microg / ml ( figure 4 ) .
figure 4 effect of compound 2 on hsv - 1 replication in vero cells .
the 50 % inhibitory concentration ( ec50 ) of each extract was calculated using regression line .
each bar represents the mean +/ - sd of three independent experiments .
( p < 0.05 ) .
for comparison , the effect of the reference compound acv was also studied under our assay conditions .
when compared to the reference compound acv , 2 was significantly less potent ( table 2 ) ( 26 ) .
table 2 the percentage of antiviral activity of pure sesquiterpene coumarins determined as plaque reduction assay by comparison with untreated controls .
the values are expressed as mean +/ - sd of three separate experiments sample 10 5 2.5 1 - - - 2 98 +/ - 5.2 % 80 +/ - 3.8 % 65 +/ - 2.2 % 3 - - - acyclovir 100 100 85 +/ - 2.9 % several natural products are effective against hsv - 1 or - 2 like several mono , di , tri ( 6 - 8 ) and tetra terpenoids ( 9 ) , but no sesquiterpene coumarins have been previously investigated for hsv treatment , despite their effect on hiv ( 27 ) .
different mechanisms underlie the anti - hsv activity of natural products .
essential oils directly inactivate herpes virus and might interfere with virion envelope structures or mask viral structures necessary for adsorption or entry into the host cells , while inhibition of hsv occur before adsorption but not after penetration of the virus into the cell .
inactivation could occur by prevention of cell - to - cell spread ( 6 ) .
polyphenols like tannins ( 28 ) and flavonoid glycosides ( 29,30 ) exhibit anti - hsv activity mostly by inhibiting entry into the host cells .
other mechanisms are diminishing the synthesis of viral dna and inhibition the spread of infectious viral particles by using hsv - 1 expressing - galactosidase activity as a detection system ( 8 ) or oligomerization of hsv - 1 glycoprotein d ( 28 ) .
oligomeric stilbenoids exert anti - hsv effect by ros production promotion ( 31 ) .
most sesquiterpenoids are only moderately virucidal against different enveloped viruses , e.g. herpes simplex , cytomegalo - , measles and influenza viruses , but several essential oils show virucidal activity through inhibition of glycosylation of viral proteins ( 6 ) .
a remarkable aspect of the antiviral activity of natural products is their ability to inhibit acyclovir - resistant hsv - 1 isolates , showing mechanism complementarity with acyclovir that interferes with the dna polymerase inside the cell ( 6,32 ) .
furthermore , some plant extracts show only indirect antiviral properties , being endowed of immunomodulatory properties by interacting with il - 12 , ifn - and tnf - alpha ( 9 ) .
overall , should be considered that ferula spp render various biologically active components ( 33 - 35 ) .
regarding the mechanism of action of sesquiterpene coumarins , given the capacity of coumarin to trap thiol groups and act as a michael acceptor ( 36 ) , it does not seem unreasonable to assume that they share the same mechanism as sesquiterpene lactones ( 10 ) .

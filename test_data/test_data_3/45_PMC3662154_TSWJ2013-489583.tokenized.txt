1. introduction drought is probably the most important abiotic stress that limits plant growth [ 1 ] .
drought stress is one of the most serious environmental factors that can severely limit the yield and quality of agricultural crops [ 2 ]. with global climate change , the lack of water for agronomic purposes will become the major problem for crop production [ 3 ] .
in agronomical point - of - view , drought stress is a situation in which lack of water exceeds the capacity of plants which leads to the growth prevention .
thus , improving the drought tolerance is a major adaptation strategy for plant production in arid and semiarid regions [ 4 ] .
in drought prone environments , crop drought resistance is a major factor in the stabilization of crop performance .
drought resistance is now considered by both breeders and molecular biologists as a valid breeding target .
wheat ( triticum aestivum l. ) is one of the most important cereals in the world .
drought stress may reduce all yield components in wheat [ 5 ] .
drought is the major factor limiting wheat growth and productivity in many regions of the world , and the changing global climate is making the situation more serious [ 6 , 7 ] .
developing high - yielding wheat cultivars under drought conditions in arid and semiarid regions is an important objective of breeding programs [ 5 ] .
although great efforts have been made in wheat drought resistance breeding , the decrease in agricultural productivity induced by drought stress still remains unsolved [ 8 ] .
one reason is that the numerous germplasm resources were not effectively utilized in wheat breeding programs .
however , with continuous collection of germplasm resources , the size of populations has been becoming bigger and bigger , which hindered the evaluation and utilization of the wheat germplasm resources .
core collections provide an efficient way to evaluate and utilize germplasm resources .
a core collection is a representative sample of the whole collection which has minimum repetitiveness and maximum genetic diversity of a plant species [ 9 ] .
the core collection serves as a working collection to be evaluated and utilized preferentially [ 10 - 13 ] .
in this way , it is possible to preserve most of the genes in large germplasm populations using a small sample .
thus , the objectives of this research were ( 1 ) to investigate the ideal constructing strategy on wheat core collection based on data of agronomic traits combining drought resistance information and ( 2 ) to construct such a wheat core collection for the drought resistance breeding programs .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
materials wheat varieties were introduced from abroad .
the drought resistance level combining four yield traits ( plant height , spike length , grain numbers per spike , and 1000 - grain weight ) and four quality traits ( crude protein content , lysine content , sedimentation , and hardness ) of 1,683 varieties have been investigated .
all data were downloaded from " chinese crop germplasm resources information system " ( http :// icgr.caas.net.cn /) .
2.2 .
core collection construction according to the drought resistance level , all 1,683 wheat varieties were divided into five germplasm groups ( high resistant , hr ; resistant , r ; moderate resistant , mr ; susceptible , s ; and high susceptible , hs ) .
the distribution of varieties was shown in figure 1 .
the procedure for core collection construction was conducted by two steps .
first , subcore collections were selected from each germplasm groups .
second , all the sub - core collections were combined together to construct a core collection .
the least distance stepwise sampling ( ldss ) method [ 14 ] was adopted to construct sub - core collections from germplasm groups .
the procedure was as follows .
( 1 ) the genetic distances among accessions were calculated , and accessions were classified by hierarchical cluster analysis based on their genetic distance .
( 2 ) one accession from a subgroup with the least distance was randomly removed , and another accession of the subgroup was sampled .
( 3 ) the genetic distances among the remaining accessions were calculated , and the sampling was repeated in the same way .
the stepwise samplings were performed until the percentage of the remaining accessions reached the desired one .
this method performs sampling based on the subgroup with the least genetic distance , which can efficiently eliminate redundant accessions and ignore the effect of the cluster methods [ 15 ] .
2.3 .
genetic distances and evaluating parameters six commonly used genetic distances ( euclidean distance , euclid ; standardized euclidean distance , seuclid ; mahalanobis distance , mahal ; manhattan distance , manhat ; cosine distance , cosine ; and correlation distance , correlation ) were used to assess genetic distances among accessions .
unweighted pair - group average ( upgma ) method was used for performing hierarchical cluster analysis [ 15 ] .
coincidence rate of range ( cr ) and variable rate of coefficient of variation ( vr ) [ 16 , 17 ] were adopted to evaluate the representativeness of core collection .
those four parameters were formulated as follows : cr = ( 1 / n ) sumi = 1 n ( r c ( i )/ r i ( i )) x 100 , where r c ( i ) is the range of the ith trait in the core collection ; r i ( i ) is the range of the corresponding trait in the initial collection ; n and is total number of traits , vr = ( 1 / n ) sumi = 1 n ( cvc ( i )/ cvi ( i )) x 100 , where cvc ( i ) is the coefficient of variation of the ith trait in the core collection ; cvi ( i ) is the coefficient of variation of the corresponding trait in the initial collection ; n is total number of traits .
2.4 .
data analysis the genetic distances calculation , the ldss procedures , and the evaluating parameters calculation were performed using computer code programmed by the authors based on matlab software ( version 6.5 ) [ 18 ] .
3. results 3.1 .
the assessment of subcore collections constructed by different genetic distances subcore collections were constructed by different genetic distances at the sampling percentage of 10 % , 20 % , and 30 % ( table 1 ) .
in any germplasm group , cr and vr of sub - core collections constructed by the genetic distance of cosine and correl were much lower than of those constructed by the other four genetic distances at the three sampling percentages ( table 1 ) .
in hr group , sub - core collections constructed by manhat had larger cr and vr than those constructed by euclid , seuclid , and mahal at the three sampling percentages ( table 1 ) .
in r group , sub - core collections constructed by euclid had the largest cr at the sampling percentage of 10 % and 30 % , and those constructed by manhat had the largest vr at the sampling percentage of 10 % and 20 % ( table 1 ) .
in mr group , sub - core collections constructed by mahal had the largest cr at the sampling percentage of 20 % and 30 % , and those constructed by seuclid had the largest vr at the sampling percentage of 10 % and 20 % , but similar vr than that constructed by euclid at the sampling percentage of 30 % ( table 1 ) .
in s group , sub - core collections constructed by seuclid had the largest cr at the three sampling percentage , while there was no significant pattern in vr ( table 1 ) .
in hs group , sub - core collections constructed by euclid had the largest cr at the sampling percentage of 20 % and 30 % , and those constructed by mahal had the largest vr at the sampling percentage of 10 % and 30 % ( table 1 ) .
synthesizing the results above , five ideal combinations for sub - core collection were selected : hr - manhat , r - euclid , mr - mahal , s - seuclid , and hs - euclid .
3.2 .
selection of the optimal sampling percentage in each germplasm group , sub - core collections were constructed based on the selected genetic distance with the sampling percentage increasing from 5 % to 30 % .
the value of cr of each sub - core collection was calculated .
thus , 26 crs were calculated in each group .
the constructing results of the five groups were summarized in figure 2 .
in each group , the cr showed logarithmic changing .
the cr increased drastically when the sampling percentage was small. with the sampling percentage increasing , cr increased steady ( figure 2 ) .
the rangeability in the group of hr and r was larger than that in the groups of mr , s , and hs ( figure 2 ) .
each curve of in figure 2 was treated by curve fitting analysis , and the results were summarized in table 2 .
the equations showed logarithmic form , and the coefficient of determination of fitted equations ( r 2 ) of each equation was larger than 0.9 ( table 2 ) .
based on the equations , the optimal sampling percentage was calculated by setting the value of cr (%) to 95.00 ( table 2 ) .
3.3 .
validation of the ideal constructing strategy the principal component analysis was adopted to validate sub - core collections constructed by the ideal strategy selected by the present research .
principal component plots of core accessions and reserve accessions in each germplasm group were drown in figure 3 .
the total genetic variation percentage of the first two principal components was 71.51 % in hr group , 67.67 % in r group , 66.90 % in mr group , 68.45 % in s group , and 71.83 % in hs group .
at the same sampling percentage , compared to the sub - core collections constructed by complete random selection , the core accessions selected by the present strategy showed more symmetrical distribution in the whole germplasm group , and most extreme accessions were selected ( figure 3 ) .
4. discussion core collection has been studied for about twenty years [ 19 , 20 ] .
a valid core collection provides a high - efficient way to assess genetic diversity or to find beneficial genes [ 21 - 24 ] .
most core collection researches focused on finding efficient ways in sub - core collection selection [ 25 - 27 ] .
however , there is not a widely accepted strategy for constructing sub - core collection up to now .
one common approach for constructing a core collection is splitting the whole germplasm population into several groups , then , selecting representative core accessions from each group to form sub - core collections , and combining all sub - core collections to form the final core collection [ 16 , 28 ] .
the present research divided the whole wheat germplasm population into five groups based on drought resistance level .
the results showed that the distribution pattern of accessions was various in different germplasm group , which might lead to different suitable strategy for sub - core collection construction .
therefore , different germplasm group required different constructing strategy , and it is needlessly to try to find a widely accepted constructing strategy .
the representativeness is the most important character for a core collection .
the vr represents the difference of variance between core collection and the initial collection .
the value of vr is affected greatly by the number of accessions in the core collection .
in core collection construction based on a valid strategy , with the sampling percentage increasing , the variance decreased and the mean almost keeps unchanging , which led to the decrease of vr. however , at the same sampling percentage , bigger vr means more variation preserved in core collection .
the cr shows the extent of preservation of the trait scope in a core collection .
the value of cr is not affected greatly by the number of accessions .
in the present research , the cr showed sensitivity to the representativeness of a sub - core collection .
the cr has been reported to be an important parameter for the evaluation of the representativeness of the core collections [ 9 , 29 , 30 ] .
based on the above analysis , the ideal genetic distance for different group was determined first by cr , then by vr. moreover , a genetic distance that could make higher cr at low sampling percentage might be more valid than others .
in the present research , data of eight agronomic traits in 1,683 wheat varieties were downloaded from public database of " chinese crop germplasm resources information system. " such a big number of wheat germplasm might not be planted within one area or one year .
therefore , the upper data might not be collected based on the same cultivating standards , which might affect the precision of the final core collection .
however , there were more than one agronomic trait used in the present research .
data of eight agronomic traits were used to calculate cr and vr. the two evaluating parameters reflected the mean representativeness of the eight agronomic traits in the core collection , which reduced the error mentioned above .
a wheat core collection for the drought resistance breeding programs was constructed by the strategy selected in the present research based on the upper dataset .
table 2 showed the optimal genetic distance and the relative optimal sampling percentage for sub - core collection in each germplasm group .
therefore , the whole core collection was constructed by combining all sub - core collections .
the principal component analysis showed that the genetic diversity was well preserved in that core collection .
the method for the ideal constructing strategy selection suggested in the present research is also valuable in other crop 's core collection construction .

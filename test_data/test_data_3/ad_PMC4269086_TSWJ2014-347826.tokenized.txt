to establish the prevalence of nasopupillary asymmetry ( difference in nasopupillary distances ) in the population and its relation with the interpupillary distance. methods .
a retrospective descriptive study was conducted by reviewing of 1262 medical records .
the values of nasopupillary asymmetry and the interpupillary distance were obtained .
a statistical analysis was made and the correlation between these variables was established. results .
seventy - nine percent of the population presented some degree of nasopupillary asymmetry .
the interpupillary distance had a very low correlation with the nasopupillary asymmetry ( r = 0.074 , p = 0.0 ). conclusion .
it is advisable to use the nasopupillary distance of each eye as a standard measurement .
1. introduction the interpupillary distance ( id ) is the distance measured between the centers of the pupils , and it is important for the creation of the stereoscopic vision , which results in a single tridimensional image [ 1 , 2 ] .
the id is an important measure widely used today as part of the process of eyeglasses formulation [ 3 , 4 ] .
furthermore , the nasopupillary distance ( npd ) is the measure from the pupil center to the medial nasal axis [ 5 , 6 ] .
however , currently the nasopupillary asymmetry ( npa ) ( difference in nasopupillary distances ) and its relation to the id have not been studied [ 7 ] .
additionally , there have not been reported in the literature data of the percentage of the population with npa .
in this research , the values of npa and its relation to id in a colombian population were studied , evidencing that most of the population presents some degree of npa .
this is the first research reported in the literature that studies the npa .
2. methods a retrospective descriptive study was conducted by reviewing 1300 medical records .
patients with any type of strabismus , single eye and those under 18 were excluded , thereby obtaining a total sample of 1262 medical records of 631 women and an equal number of men , aged between 18 and 99 years .
the id and npd measurement was performed all the time by the same specialist utilizing the essilor pupillometer calibrated by long distance .
the instrument shows the id and also the two separate nasopupillary distances ( right and left eyes ) ( figure 1 ) .
the npa was obtained by calculating the difference between the npd of the right eye ( re ) and the npd of the left eye ( le ) , for each patient .
data was collected and a statistical analysis for the entire population was performed .
the degree of npa was classified as low ( up to 2 mm ) , medium ( greater than 2 mm up to 4 mm ) , and high ( greater than 4 mm ) .
also , which eye was farthest from the nasal axis ( greater npd ) and the distribution of this variable to the entire population were analyzed .
a calculation to determine the relation between the npa and the id was made , by pearson 's correlation coefficient .
3. results the average age of the population was 46.8 +/ - 18 ( range : 18 - 99 ) years , with a mean of 48.65 +/ - 17.57 ( range : 18 - 99 ) years for women and 44.94 +/ - 18.24 ( range : 18 - 92 ) years for men. of the total sample , 288 ( 22.82 %) patients were from 18 to 30 years of age , 444 ( 35.18 %) were from 31 to 50 , 382 ( 30.26 %) were from 51 to 70 , and 148 ( 11.72 %) were from 71 to 99 .
the npd mean of the re was 31.65 +/ - 1.86 ( range : 26 - 38 ) mm , median was 31.5 mm , and the mode was 31 mm. the npd of the le had a mean of 30.90 +/ - 1.8 ( range : 26 - 37 ) mm , a median of 31 mm , and a mode of 31 mm. for the id a mean of 62.58 +/ - 3.35 ( range : 52.5 - 73 ) mm , a median of 62 mm , and a mode of 62 mm were found .
the mean of npa for the population was 1.28 +/ - 1.04 ( range : 0 - 6 ) mm. a median of 1 mm and a mode of 1 mm for the npa in the population were obtained .
the confidence interval for the npa was 1.28 +/ - 0.057 mm. of all patients , 997 ( 79 %) had some degree of npa and 265 ( 21 %) had a symmetrical npd , and this difference was statistically significant ( p = 0.0 ) .
834 patients ( 83.73 %) showed a low npa , 155 ( 15.46 %) a medium npa , and 8 ( 0.8 %) a high npa. of the total population of patients with npa , 76 ( 7.6 %) patients had an npa of 0.5 mm , 445 ( 44.6 %) of 1 mm , 43 ( 4.3 %) of 1.5 mm , 270 ( 27.08 %) of 2 mm , 10 ( 1 %) of 2.5 mm , 114 ( 11.43 %) of 3 mm , 3 ( 0.3 %) of 3.5 mm , 28 ( 2.8 %) of 4 mm , 5 ( 0.5 %) of 5 mm , and 3 ( 0.3 %) of 6 mm ( figure 2 ) .
729 patients ( 73.19 %) had the re farther than the le ( re npd greater than le npd ) and the remaining 268 ( 26.8 %) had the le farther than the re ( le npd higher than the re npd ) ( p = 0.0 ) .
a very low correlation between id and npa was found ( r = 0.074 , p = 0.0 ) ( figure 3 ) .
4. discussion the magnitude of id has a great importance ; however , the perfect symmetry on the face is not present in all people [ 8 , 9 ] .
the id does not consider the ocular asymmetry .
the nature of the npd has elements that make it variable , such as the gender , race , and age [ 3 , 10 - 12 ] .
this variability may be influenced by the techniques and instruments used to measure it , due to parallax errors , patient care , reading accuracy , and the fixation point , especially when the millimeter ruler is used [ 13 ] .
the pupillometer is a tool that can be used to measure both the npd and the id , in which the measurement is based on the assessment of the corneal reflex in both eyes while the patient observes a fixation point .
this method provides a more accurate measurement than a metric ruler , since when the patient observes the fixation point , the corneal reflection denotes the point known as visual axis or vision line , and without the errors of parallelism of the lanterns or other systems [ 14 ] .
in this paper the npa was studied through a digital pupillometer in a colombian population , finding that 79 % of the population has some degree of npa .
83.73 % of the population with npa presented a low npa , which could not be clinically significant ; nonetheless , the remaining 16.7 % presented a greater npa , which could be significant .
the low correlation found between the id and the npa ( r = 0.074 ) reflects the lack of relation between the id and the ocular asymmetry .
this could be especially important for the eyeglasses prescription , since if this is not taken into account , it could cause the failure to obtain a correct centering of the ophthalmic lenses , inducing a prismatic effect and a binocular vision , especially in progressive lenses [ 15 , 16 ] .
all of the above underlines the importance of the npd of each eye as an optometric measure .
it should be noted that most automated refractometers and phoropters do not have the possibility of including the npd at the time of examination .
according to our results it would be advisable to use the npd of each eye as standard measurement , especially in patients with medium and high npa , when the refractive error is high and of course with the increasing use of multifocal lens for patients with presbyopia [ 17 ] .
similarly , the relation of the npa with other variables should be established .
this will be studied by the present authors in a further study .

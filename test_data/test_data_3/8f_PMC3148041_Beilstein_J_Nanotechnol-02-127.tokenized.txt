nanostructured materials have promising capabilities applicable for the construction of various photonic and electronic devices .
in this paper , a mesoporous tio2 thin film photoanode was soaked in an aqueous methanol solution using an o2 - reducing pt - based cathode in contact with atmospheric air on the back side .
it was shown from distinct photocurrents in the cyclic voltammogram ( cv ) that the nanosurface of the mesoporous n - tio2 film forms a schottky junction with water containing a strong electron donor such as methanol .
formation of a schottky junction ( liquid junction ) was also proved by mott - schottky plots at the mesoporous tio2 thin film photoanode , and the thickness of the space charge layer was estimated to be very thin , i.e. , only 3.1 nm at - 0.1 v vs ag / agcl .
on the other hand , the presence of [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - and the absence of methanol brought about ohmic contact behavior on the tio2 film and exhibited reversible redox waves in the dark due to the [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - / 3 - couple .
further studies showed that multiple schottky junctions / ohmic contact behavior inducing simultaneously both photocurrent and overlapped reversible redox waves was found in the cv of a nanoporous tio2 photoanode soaked in an aqueous redox electrolyte solution containing methanol and [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - . that is , the tio2 nanosurface responds to [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - to give ohmic redox waves overlapped simultaneously with photocurrents due to the schottky junction .
additionally , a second step photocurrent generation was observed in the presence of both meoh and [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - around the redox potential of the iron complex .
it was suggested that the iron complex forms a second schottky junction for which the flat band potential ( e fb ) lies near the redox potential of the iron complex .
cyclic voltammogram of titanium dioxide photoanode flat band potential nanoporous tio2 thin film photocurrent schottky junction and ohmic contact introduction photoelectrocatalytic reactions at semiconductor electrodes were investigated before the 1960s [ 1 - 2 ] .
a semiconductor electrode forms a type of schottky junction with liquid electrolytes called a liquid junction , which generates a photocurrent .
a crystalline n - tio2 photoanode to decompose water by uv light attracted a great attention [ 3 ] ; organic compounds have also been similarly decomposed [ 4 - 5 ] .
later , a nanoporous tio2 thin film was applied to a dye - sensitized solar cell ( dssc ) [ 6 ] in which the nanoporous tio2 film works in an organic liquid electrolyte solution as an electron acceptor and conductor rather than as a liquid junction semiconductor. with regard to this invention , the photoreactivity of nanoporous semiconductors has been an important issue in potential applications .
there has been much argument as to the nature of the interface between nanoporous semiconductor and an aqueous redox electrolyte solution such as k4 [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] [ 7 - 10 ] .
the nature of such an interface should strongly depend on the type and concentration of the redox substrate present in the solution phase due to the nanostructure .
it was reported that cathodic photocurrents were obtained at a nanocrystalline tio2 film electrode due to oxygen reduction in alkaline solutions [ 7 ] .
visible light sensitization of tio2 by surface complexation with [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - has also been reported [ 8 ] .
in such a case it was suggested that the electron injection occurs at only one or a few ti centers located very close to the adsorbed location of the iron cyanide complex [ 9 ] .
as one of the applications in solid - state electronics , an optoelectronic logic device was fabricated from nanocrystalline tio2 modified with hexacyanoferrate anions [ 10 ] .
the present authors have reported a cell composed of a nanoporous semiconductor photoanode and an o2 - reducing cathode that can efficiently photodecompose various bio - related compounds in water [ 11 - 12 ] .
when ammonia was present in water in contact with a nanoporous tio2 photoanode , the semiconductor formed a kind of schottky junction , which induced efficient decomposition of ammonia with a high internal quantum efficiency ( i.e. , the number of decomposed molecules per photon activating an nh3 molecule ) of over 100 (= 104 %) through auto - oxidative decomposition of the activated ammonia [ 12 ] .
in subsequent research we found that a mesoporous tio2 semiconductor film forms both a schottky junction as well as exhibiting partial ohmic contact behavior in a redox electrolyte solution and this multi - nature behavior is reported in this publication .
results and discussion the cyclic voltammogram ( cv ) at a nanoporous tio2 ( t / sp , solaronix ) thin film photoanode soaked in a 10 wt % aqueous methanol solution (+ 0.1 m na2so4 electrolyte , ph 8.5 ) in a cell ( fig. 1 ) under an ar atmosphere is shown in fig. 2. figure 1 side view of a photoelectrochemical cell ( 1 cm x 1 cm x 3 cm ) used for cv measurements with membrane electrode assembly ( mea ) attached to a pt - mesh cathode .
figure 2 cyclic voltammograms both in the dark ( black line ) and with light irradiation ( gray line ) at a nanoporous tio2 photoanode ( 1cm x 1cm ) in an aqueous solution of 10 wt % methanol (+ 0.1 m na2so4 , ph 8.5 ) under an ar atmosphere with mea - attached pt ( 1 cm x 1 cm ) as the counter electrode and ag / agcl as the reference electrode .
the light intensity was 3.5 mw.cm - 2 ( uv - a region ) .
scan rate : 100 mv.s - 1 .
in the dark in the cathodic scan from 0.6 v to - 0.6 v vs ag / agcl , the cathodic current starts to increase around 0 v vs ag / agcl most probably due to o2 reduction in the first instance and then h + reduction , and in the reverse scan re - oxidation of the generated h2 occurs whose peak is located around - 0.45 v vs ag / agcl. by contrast , under irradiation the cv shows distinct photocurrents that reach a plateau around 0 v , demonstrating clearly that band bending occurs at the tio2 / liquid interface due to a kind of schottky junction formation as noted below .
since much argument exists as to the nature of the contact between a mesoporous tio2 thin film and an electrolyte solution , this will first be discussed here .
taking an n - type semiconductor ( sc ) , such as tio2 and a metal as an example , we adopt the case that the fermi level ( e f ) of the sc is higher ( i. e. , more negative ) than that of the metal .
for an n - sc , the fermi level is located at a slightly lower ( more positive ) level than the lower edge of the conduction band ( cb ) ( fig. 3 ) .
when the n - sc is in contact with the metal ( or the same with an electrolyte solution instead of the metal ) , the electrons in the sc are transported to the vacant level of the metal ( or electrolyte solution ) , which makes the sc positively charged , and the metal ( or electrolyte solution ) negatively charged .
as the result the band structure of the sc ( both the valence band ( vb ) and the conduction band ) is bent as shown in fig. 3. figure 3 formation of a schottky barrier ( junction ) in an n - semiconductor photoanode at the interface with aqueous electron donor / electrolyte solution .
e f = fermi level , e g = band gap , vb = valence band , cb = conduction band .
this curved portion of the band structure is called a space charge layer ( also called a depletion layer , where electrons are depleted ) .
under this condition , on irradiation by photons at the interface between the sc and the metal ( or electrolyte solution ) , the energy of which is larger than the bandgap ( e g ) of the semiconductor ( for tio2 e g ~ 3.2 ev , wavelength < 390 nm ) , excitation of electrons from the vb to cb in the sc takes place leaving holes in the vb. the electron and the hole form an exciton ( excited electron - hole pair ) , which is usually short - lived and recombines if there is no driving force to separate them .
however , when the band structure is bent as in fig. 3 for an n - sc , the hole can migrate towards the sc interface , and the electron can migrate towards inside of the semiconductor bulk , thus the hole and the electron are now separated .
after such migration of holes and electrons , when an electron donor ( such as ethanol ) is present in the contacted liquid phase , the holes can oxidize the donor in the liquid , and the electrons are transported first to the fluorine - doped tin oxide ( fto , sno2 : f ) conductive layer through tio2 grain boundaries and then to the cathode reducing electron acceptor there ( o2 in the present case ) .
in a schottky junction , under the conditions when the band structure is flat without any bending , the fermi level is called the flat band potential ( e fb ) .
when an n - sc ( i.e. , photoanode ) and a cathode are soaked in an electrolyte solution where an electron donor is present , and the anodic potential is applied to the sc under irradiation , anodic photocurrents begin to be generated due to band bending when the applied potential is shifted from cathodic polarization towards the anodic direction thus preventing electron - hole recombination of the exciton .
if such a space charge layer of a schottky junction does not exist , the holes and the electrons present as an exciton formed by photoirradiation recombine quickly and preferentially without generating a photocurrent .
the photocurrents shown in the cv ( fig. 2 ) evidently proves that a schottky junction is formed in the nanostructured tio2 thin film .
it is quite unambiguous from fig. 2 that , similar to conventional semiconductor electrode photoelectrochemistry , the nanostructured tio2 also forms a schottky junction in the redox electrolyte solution generating photocurrents .
for a schottky junction semiconductor , the mott - schottky relation ( eq .
1 ) is obtained [ 4 ] , where c sc is the capacitance of the space charge layer [ f.m - 2 ] , epsilon the relative permittivity ( epsilon of tio2 = 85.8 and 170 , anisotropic ) , epsilon0 the vacuum permittivity ( 8.854 x 10 - 12 f.m - 1 ) , q the elementary electric charge ( 1.602 x 10 - 19 c ) , n the carrier density [ m - 3 ] , e the applied potential [ v ] , e fb the flat band potential [ v ] , k b the boltzman constant ( 1.380 x 10 - 23 j.k - 1 ) , and t the absolute temperature [ k ] .
[ 1 ] when d [ m ] is the thickness of the space charge layer , c sc can be approximated to ( epsilon.epsilon0 )/ d , so that d is estimated by eq .
2. [ 2 ] when measuring the capacitance of the sc electrode , if plots of 1 / c sc 2 against the applied potential ( e ) exhibit a linear relationship , the formation of a schottky barrier is proved. from the intercept (= e - e fb - ( k b t )/ q ) of the plots on the potential axis , the flat band potential is obtained , and from the slope (= 2 /( epsilon.epsilon0.q.n )) , the carrier density n can be estimated .
the flat band potential e fb of a nanoporous tio2 thin film photoanode soaked in water was measured by mott - schottky plots in a 10 wt % meoh aqueous solution containing 0.1 m na2so4 ( ph 8.5 ) under irradiation , and the results are shown in fig. 4. figure 4 mott - schottky plot of a nanoporous tio2 thin film coated on fto in contact with a 10 % aqueous methanol solution (+ 0.1 m na2so4 ) under irradiation .
measured with 100 hz frequency and ac amplitude = 10 mv. since the plot exhibits a linear relationship this proves that the tio2 film forms a schottky junction. from eq .
1 and eq .
2 , the flat band potential e fb , carrier density n , and the thickness of space charge layer d sc were calculated and are shown in table 1 .
for the calculation , since the relative permittivity epsilon of tio2 is anisotropic ( 85.8 and 170 ) , we used both the values in the calculation , and thereafter took their average values considering the macroscopically amorphous nature of the mesoporous tio2 film .
since the space charge layer thickness ( d sc ) is dependent on the applied potential , we calculated the value at the applied potential of - 0.1 v vs ag / agcl at which the cv under irradiation approaches a saturated value as shown in the fig. 2. table 1 flat band potential e fb , space charge layer thickness d sc of the schottky junction , and carrier density n in a mesoporous tio2 thin film coated on fto obtained by the mott - schottky plots shown in fig. 4. d sc and n are average values when epsilon of tio2 = 85.8 and 170 .
efb vs ag / agcl at ph 8.5 [ v ] - 0.16 dsc at - 0.1 v vs ag / agcl [ nm ] 3.10 n [ cm - 3 ] 6.96 x 1019 the obtained flat band potential was - 0.16 v vs ag / agcl at ph 8.5 under irradiation .
the space charge layer thickness was only 3.10 nm ( at - 0.1 v vs ag / agcl ) , much thinner than that of conventional sc electrodes for which it is 100 nm to 1 mm. this very thin space charge layer is reasonable since the present mesoporous tio2 thin film consists of small particles of on average 13 nm diameter .
the band structure of the nanostructured tio2 film can therefore be depicted as in fig. 5. it should be noted here that the 3 - d structured thin film is shown as a 2 - d picture .
the thin space charge layer is located at the interface between tio2 and the liquid , and the band structure ( cb and vb ) in the tio2 bulk is interconnected through the tio2 grain boundaries forming continuous cb electron - transporting channels from the space charge layer to reach the conductive layer on the fto .
when tio2 is excited by uv light , excitons are formed , but many of these would recombine simply wasting the excitation energy if band bending did not exist .
however , due to the band bending in the space charge layer formed at the tio2 / liquid interface , the excitons formed here would be separated into electrons and holes due to the slope of the vb and cb bands , the h + then being reduced by meoh present in the liquid , and the e - being transported in the cb through tio2 grain boundaries to the counter cathode via the fto .
as reported earlier by us [ 13 ] , resistances at the grain boundaries are low for such mesoporous tio2 thin film as investigated by an alternating current impedance spectroscopy .
figure 5 schematic representation for the formation of continuous schottky junctions with space charge layer ( i.e. , depletion layer , green region ) and conduction band ( cb , gray region ) in a nanoporous n - tio2 thin film formed at the interface with an aqueous electrolyte solution containing an electron donor .
in the space charge layer holes ( h +) of the excitons ( excited e - - h + couples , red circle ) migrate in the vb onto the tio2 surface reacting with the e - donor , and electrons ( e - ) of the exciton migrate into the bulk cb where e - then migrate through tio2 grain boundaries and finally into the conductive layer on fto .
it should be noted that the 3 - d structured nano - ordered thin film is shown as a 2 - d picture here .
the electron conductivity of tio2 itself is not high .
however , the carrier density n of 6.96 x 1019 cm - 3 obtained from fig. 4 was high , in the order as that of graphite , indicating that the mesoporous tio2 thin film can function as a good electron - conductive material under irradiation conditions when a strong electron donor is present in the liquid .
it should be noted that in a dye - sensitized solar cell ( dssc ) [ 6 ] , a mesoporous tio2 thin film also functions as an electron conductor under irradiation due to the large electron density injected from the photoexcited state of tio2 - attached dye molecules .
the cv of the nanoporous tio2 ( t / sp , solaronix ) thin film photoanode soaked in an aqueous solution containing only 400 mum [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - (+ 0.1 m na2so4 , ph 8.5 ) without methanol is shown in fig. 6. figure 6 cyclic voltammogram in the dark ( black line ) and with light irradiation ( gray line ) at a nanoporous tio2 photoanode ( 1 cm x 1 cm ) in a 400 mum [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - aqueous solution (+ 0.1 m na2so4 , ph 8.5 ) under an ar atmosphere with mea ( 1 cm x 1 cm ) as the counter electrode and ag / agcl as the reference electrode .
light intensity 3.5 mw.cm - 2 ( uv - a region ) .
scan rate : 100 mv.s - 1 .
in the dark , the cv showed clear reversible redox waves typical for the [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - / 3 - couple at 0.26 v vs ag / agcl at ph 8.5 , demonstrating that the nanoporous tio2 film shows ohmic contact behavior with the [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - complex .
this would be due to the thin space charge layer structure ; the applied positive charges can oxidize the fe ( ii ) complex through the space charge layer , and then re - reduce the oxidized fe ( iii ) complex in the reverse scan .
under irradiation , only a low photocurrent was observed due to the absence of meoh since the electron donating ability of the fe complex is low .
it should be noted here that the redox potential of the iron complex obtained was much more positive than that of this complex ( 0.69 v vs she at ph 0 , corresponding to - 0.03 v vs ag / agcl at ph 8.5 ) , which could be interpreted by the redox potential shift of the iron complex attached to the dissociated surface structure by ligand exchange of the fe2 +/ 3 + center between cn - and ti - o - . when both the methanol and the [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - were present in the aqueous phase , the behavior was interesting .
in the dark , the cv also showed clear reversible redox waves for the [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - / 3 - couple ( fig. 7 ) at 0.26 v vs ag / agcl ( ph 8.5 ) .
figure 7 cyclic voltammogram in the dark ( black line ) and light irradiation ( gray line ) at a nanoporous tio2 photoanode ( 1 cm x 1 cm ) in a 10 wt % aqueous methanol solution containing 400 mum [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - (+ 0.1 m na2so4 , ph 8.5 ) under an ar atmosphere with mea ( 1 cm x 1 cm ) as the counter electrode and ag / agcl as the reference electrode .
light intensity 3.5 mw.cm - 2 ( uv - a region ) .
scan rate : 100 mv.s - 1 .
under irradiation conditions an anodic photocurrent was clearly observed in the cv curve due to the electron donating meoh , and , in addition , the photocurrent cv curve was overlapped by the reversible redox waves of the iron complex , showing that the nanoporous tio2 film can have simultaneously both schottky junction and ohmic contact behavior .
sensitization and electron transfer in tio2 nanoparticles and nanoporous electrodes by [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - has been thoroughly investigated [ 8 - 10 ] , but such multi - nature behavior of both schottky junction and ohmic contact has not been reported .
in order to investigate further the behavior in fig. 7 , larger size ( 500 nm ) tio2 ( g2 , rutile > 95 % , note that anatase - rich sample is not available and difficult to prepare for this particle size ) was used instead of the ti - nanoxide t / sp ( average diameter 13 nm , anatase > 90 %) , and the cvs at the mesoporous g2 thin film - coated photoanode in the presence of both methanol and [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - in the aqueous phase are shown in fig. 8 in the dark and under irradiation .
for this measurement a 10 ml cylindrical cell was used with a pt black coated pt plate cathode .
it should be noted that , in the anodic direction cv curve under irradiation , a second photocurrent generation was observed starting from 0.1 v vs ag / agcl accompanying the oxidation of the iron complex .
the interpretation might not be simple , but this might suggest that the iron complex , most probably attached to the tio2 surface , induced a second band structure whose e fb lies near the redox potential of the iron complex on the tio2 surface .

light intensity 3.5 mw.cm - 2 ( uv - a region ) .
scan rate : 100 mv.s - 1 .
the photocurrents increased with repeated scans .
in a previous paper [ 14 ] by one of the present authors ( mk ) , both schottky junction and ohmic contact behavior were found at a single crystal cds photoanode with ruo2 fine powder attached to the surface and coated with a thin film of polymer - pendant ru ( bpy ) 3 2 + on top of the ruo2 .
it was clear that the cds formed a schottky junction with the redox electrolyte solution , and in addition , the ruo2 formed an ohmic contact with the cds , and the coated cationic ru ( bpy ) 3 2 + polymer electrostatically incorporating the anionic k4 [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] exhibited photocurrents that overlapped redox waves of the iron complex .
while in the multiple schottky junctions / ohmic behavior of the nanoporous tio2 soaked in a methanol aqueous solution containing [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - reported in the present paper , a second photocurrent was observed around the redox potential of the iron complex .
this schottky junction / ohmic contact behavior could schematically be represented by fig. 9. such multiple schottky junctions / ohmic contact behavior must originate from the nanostructured nature of the nanoporous tio2 thin film photoanode .
figure 9 schematic representation of a two - step schottky junction / ohmic contact behavior of a nanoporous n - tio2 thin film .
conclusion the nanosurface of a mesoporous n - tio2 film forms , in principle , a schottky junction with an aqueous electrolyte solution , so that , in the presence of strong electron - donating compound ( meoh in the present case ) , clear photocurrents were generated ( fig. 2 ). from the mott - schottky plots , the schottky junction formation was proved , and the space charge layer thickness was estimated to be 3.1 nm at the applied potential of - 0.1 v vs ag / agcl .
the tio2 nanosurface itself also forms ohmic contact with [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - complex giving ohmic redox waves ( fig. 5 ) .
the presence of both meoh and the iron complex induced simultaneous schottky junction and ohmic contact behavior exhibiting photocurrents overlapped with the redox waves of the iron complex ( fig. 7 ) .
in addition , it was suggested that the iron complex formed a second schottky junction on the semiconductor surface for which the e fb lies at the redox potential of the iron complex ( fig. 8 ) .
this schottky junction / ohmic contact behavior is schematically shown in fig. 9. the nature of a nanoporous semiconductor film soaked in liquid could be tuned easily by the presence of various electron donors and acceptors and other redox compounds in the liquid phase .
such schottky junction / ohmic contact characteristics of nanoporous semiconductor thin films could be applied to a variety of photonic and electronic devices in the future .

plasma phospholipid transfer protein ( pltp ) binds and transfers a number of amphipathic compounds , including phospholipids , cholesterol , diacylglycerides , tocopherols and lipopolysaccharides .
pltp functions are relevant for many pathophysiological alterations involved in neurodegenerative disorders ( especially lipid metabolism , redox status , and immune reactions ) , and a significant increase in brain pltp levels was observed in patients with alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) compared to controls .
to date , it has not been reported whether pltp can modulate the formation of amyloid plaques , i.e. one of the major histopathological hallmarks of ad. we thus assessed the role of pltp in the ad context by breeding pltp - deficient mice with an established model of ad , the j20 mice .
a phenotypic characterization of the amyloid pathology was conducted in j20 mice expressing or not pltp .
we showed that pltp deletion is associated with a significant reduction of cerebral abeta deposits and astrogliosis , which can be explained at least in part by a rise of abeta clearance through an increase in the microglial phagocytic activity and the expression of the abeta - degrading enzyme neprilysin .
pltp arises as a negative determinant of plaque clearance and over the lifespan , elevated pltp activity could lead to a higher abeta load in the brain .
phospholipid transfer protein alzheimer 's disease innate immunity phagocytosis microglia introduction plasma phospholipid transfer protein ( pltp ) belongs to the lipid transfer / lipopolysaccharide binding protein ( lt / lbp ) gene family as do cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( cetp ) and two proteins involved in innate immunity , lipopolysaccharide binding protein ( lbp ) and bactericidal permeability increasing protein ( bpi ) [ 1 ] .
pltp is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate species , and has the ability to bind and transfer a number of amphipathic compounds , including phospholipids , unesterified cholesterol , diacylglycerides , tocopherols and lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) [ 2 ] .
many studies have been conducted to decipher the complex action of pltp on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism .
the relationship of pltp to atherosclerosis is rather puzzling and may be dependent on the experimental setting , the animal model used and the pltp source ( plasma versus macrophage - derived ) [ 3 , 4 ]. through its ability to transport the lipophilic antioxidant alpha - tocopherol , i.e. the main isomer of vitamin e , pltp also plays a major role in maintaining the redox equilibrium between the intravascular compartment and tissues , with reported pathophysiological implications in the fields of vascular homeostasis , fertility , and cognitive functions [ 5 - 9 ] .
last but not the least , pltp has recently been reported to modulate inflammation and immune responses .
these actions rely both on its ability to transport and detoxify lipopolysaccharides ( the main component of the cellular wall of gram - negative bacteria ) [ 10 - 12 ] and on its direct action on immune cell functions [ 13 , 14 ] .
recently , a positive relationship was established between pltp activity and inflammatory markers in patients with cardiovascular disease or diabetes [ 15 - 17 ] .
pltp is secreted by a wide variety of tissues .
it is highly expressed in the central nervous system ( cns ) , and its activity can be measured in cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) [ 18 , 19 ] .
pltp functions are relevant for many pathophysiological alterations involved in the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders ( especially lipid metabolism , redox status , and immune reactions [ 20 - 22 ]) , and a significant increase in brain pltp levels , along with a decrease of its activity in the csf were observed in patients with alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) compared to controls [ 19 , 23 ] .
ad is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly population , and is characterized by the accumulation and deposition of toxic amyloid - beta peptides ( abeta ) in the brain tissue along with a neuroinflammatory reaction .
although a previous work from our group demonstrated that pltp deficiency in mice exacerbates abeta neurotoxicity and associated cognitive loss through a significant increase in cerebral oxidative stress [ 7 ] , it has not been reported whether pltp can modulate the formation of amyloid plaques , i.e. one of the major histopathological hallmarks of ad. to address this question and clarify the functional importance of pltp in the pathophysiology of ad , we have undertaken in the present work an in vivo assessment of the role of pltp in the ad context by breeding pltp - deficient mice with an established model of ad , the j20 mice .
these mice overexpress the happ gene bearing the swedish and indiana mutations , under the control of the pdgf promoter [ 24 ] .
we demonstrate that pltp deficiency in j20 mice strongly reduces amyloid - beta peptide deposition through an upregulating effect on abeta clearance mechanisms involving microglial phagocytosis and neprilysin activity .
although amyloid plaques were reduced , soluble amyloid - beta peptide amounts were comparable and spatial memory was not significantly improved in pltp - deficient compared to wild - type mice in the j20 line , which argues against a direct relationship between amyloid deposition and cognitive dysfunction in this model .
results pltp deletion does not alter soluble abeta levels in tgapp mice to address the impact of pltp on pathways involved in ad , we generated tgapp mice lacking pltp ( tgapp / pltp - / - ) and compared them with their tgapp littermates at the age of 6 months .
we first measured abeta1 - 40 and abeta1 - 42 levels in the soluble fraction of hemibrain homogenates .
as shown in figure 1a and 1b ) , both peptides were found in similar amounts in brains of tgapp / pltp - / - mice and their tgapp littermates .
a tendency towards an increase in abeta1 - 42 levels was observed in tgapp / pltp - / - mice ( p = 0.15 ) .
oligomeric forms of the abeta peptides , measured using the specific a11 antibody , were present at similar levels in the soluble fraction of brain homogenates from tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - animals ( figure 1c ) .
figure 1 human app expression and processing in transgenic mice with or without pltp deficiency ( a - c ) soluble forms of amyloid - beta 1 - 40 , amyloid - beta 1 - 42 , and oligomeric amyloid - beta 1 - 42 were assayed in hemibrain homogenates from 6 months old tgapp mice ( n = 8 ) and tgapp / pltp - / - mice ( n = 7 ) using elisa kits , and results were normalized to protein concentrations .
( d - e ) expression of the human app transgene and of the app - cleaving enzyme bace1 was determined in hemibrain homogenates from tgapp mice ( n = 8 ) and tgapp / pltp - / - mice ( n = 7 ) by western blot and normalized to the expression of the loading control beta - tubulin .
results are presented as mean +/ - sem .
as shown in figure 1d and 1e ) , the expression of the human app transgene was not altered by pltp deletion .
a non significant increase ( p = 0.11 ) in the amount of the app - cleaving enzyme bace1 was measured in brain homogenates of tgapp / pltp - / - compared to tgapp mice , suggesting the amyloidogenic processing of app is not significantly altered by pltp deletion .
pltp deletion decreases congo - red positive plaque load in tgapp mice to address the impact of pltp on amyloid - beta peptide deposition , the number and size of congo - red positive amyloid plaques were measured in the hippocamus and in the temporal cortex of tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mice at the age of 6 months .
as shown in figure 2a , 2b , upper panels ) , hippocampal and cortical congo red - positive plaque surfaces , expressed as a percentage of the analyzed area , were markedly decreased in pltp - deficient compared to pltp - expressing animals ( x1000 values , hippocampus : 6.73 +/ - 0.93 % in tgapp ( n = 10 ) vs 3.07 +/ - 0.70 % in tgapp / pltp - / - mice ( n = 7 ) , p < 0.01 ; temporal cortex : 0.78 +/ - 0.18 % in tgapp ( n = 10 ) vs 0.24 +/ - 0.08 % in tgapp / pltp - / - mice ( n = 7 ) , p < 0.02 ) .
the number of amyloid plaques ( lower panel ) was significantly reduced in the temporal cortex of tgapp / pltp - / - mice ( n = 6 ) compared to tgapp mice ( n = 7 ) ( 9.5 +/ - 2.4 / cm2 vs 2.9 +/ - 1.1 / cm2 , respectively , p < 0.05 ) , and a non significant decrease was measured in the hippocampus ( 46.9 +/ - 6.2 / cm2 in tgapp ( n = 10 ) vs 28.8 +/ - 8.5 / cm2 in tgapp / pltp - / - mice ( n = 7 ) , p = 0.09 ) ( figure 2a , 2b , lower panels ) .
it is worthy of note that as previously reported in this model , amyloid plaques were 5 - 10 times more abundant in the hippocampus than in the cortex .

nesting behavior and spatial reference memory assessment in tgapp mice with or without pltp deficiency nest construction is an affiliative , social behavior that was reported to be impaired in various mouse models of ad [ 25 - 27 ] .
to evaluate nest quality we used a 5 - point rating scale .
the average score of the nest quality of wt , tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mice is shown in figure 3a .
nest construction ability was significantly impaired in tgapp mice compared to wt mice ( p < 0.05 ) , and a partial restoration of this capacity was observed in tgapp / pltp - / - mice .

we next assessed spatial reference short - term memory in wt , tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mice in the y maze paradigm .
as shown in figure 3b , the spontaneous alternation performances of tgapp mice were non - significantly reduced compared to those of wt mice , and a tendency towards an increase was observed in tgapp / pltp - / - mice .
the exploratory activity , assessed through the total number of arm entries , was not significantly different between wt , tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - animals ( data not shown ) .
pltp deletion modulates neprilysin ( nep ) but not insulin - degrading - enzyme ( ide ) expression in brain tissue to address whether pltp deletion can modulate abeta clearance mechanisms , we first measured the mrna expression of the main abeta - degrading enzymes , nep and ide in brain extracts by real - time pcr .
as shown in figure 4a and 4b ) , pltp deletion is associated with a significant , 2 - fold increase in nep expression in brain homogenates ( p < 0.05 ) .
the expression of ide is mildly but not significantly increased in tgapp / pltp - / - compared to tgapp mouse brains .
figure 4 protein - dependent amyloid beta clearance in tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mouse brains the expression of the amyloid - beta degrading enzymes nep ( a ) and ide ( b ) was determined by semi - quantitative real - time pcr in purified mrna preparations obtained from hemibrain homogenates of 6 months old tgapp ( n = 8 ) and tgapp / pltp - / - ( n = 7 ) mice .
results were normalized using the expression level of gapdh .

as shown in figure 4c , a significant , 23 % decrease in apolipoprotein e levels was measured in tgapp / pltp - / - brains compared to their tgapp littermates ( p < 0.01 ) .
pltp deletion reduces astrogliosis and il - 6 levels in tgapp mice to determine whether astrogliosis was affected by deletion of the pltp gene , gfap was quantified by western blot in hemibrain homogenates and gfap - positive cell numbers were determined in brain sections from tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mice by immunohistochemistry .
as shown in figure 5a , 5b ) , a significant , 22 % decrease in gfap signal intensity was measured in brain homogenates from tgapp / pltp - / - compared to tgapp mice ( p < 0.02 ) , while astrocyte numbers were similar in both groups .
a representative picture of gfap immunostaining in the dentate gyrus area of tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mice is presented in figure 5c .
the observed decrease in astrogliosis is suggestive of a reduced neuroinflammatory response in tgapp / pltp - / - mice .

to further address the impact of pltp deficiency on brain inflammatory state , the prototypic pro - inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 ( il - 6 ) , interleukin 1 - beta ( il - 1beta ) , and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf - alpha ) were assayed in brain homogenates fromtgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mice .
as shown in table 1 , a significant , more than two - fold decrease in il - 6 levels was measured in tgapp / pltp - / - compared to tgapp mouse brains ( 0.43 +/ - 0.07 vs 0.99 +/ - 0.08 pg / mg protein , respectively , p < 0.001 ) , while no significant difference was measured for tnf - alpha and il - 1beta .

pltp deletion modifies microglial activation state and phagocytic activity in the brain of tgapp mice microglia are considered as the predominant immune cells of the brain .
they are tasked with the phagocytosis of cns material including amyloid plaques , and are known to play a major role in ad pathogenesis [ 29 , 30 ] .
we sought to determine the effect of pltp deletion on the activation state and functional phenotype of microglial cells .
we quantified microglial cells number and characterized their morphology within the hippocampus and the parietal cortex of tgapp mice and tgapp / pltp - / - mice ( figure 6 ) .
our immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of microglial cells ( iba1 - positive ) in the temporal cortex ( p < 0.05 ) , but not in the hippocampus of tgapp / pltp - / - mice compared to tgapp mice ( figure 6a and 6c ) .
activated microglia are typified by an enlarged soma , short processes , and decreased branching [ 31 ] .
we quantified the relative amounts of activated versus resting microglial cells in the hippocampus and parietal cortex of tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mice .
as shown in figure 6b and 6d ) , the percentage of activated microglia was significantly increased in the hippocampus ( p < 0.005 ) as well as in the the temporal cortex ( p < 0.05 ) of tgapp / pltp - / - mice compared to tgapp mice .
figure 6e is a representative picture of iba - 1 immunostaining in the dentate gyrus area of tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mouse brains , illustrating the increased proportion of activated microglial cells in the context of pltp deficiency .

for each animal , iba - 1 - positive cells were counted in 3 fields of the hippocampus ( 1 in the dentate gyrus , 1 in ca1 , 1 in ca3 ) ( a ) and in 1 field of the parietal cortex ( c ) from 4 different sections .
two distinctive microglial phenoytpes were manually discriminated in the hippocampus ( b ) and parietal cortex ( d ) of tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mice as described in the ' materials and methods' section , and the percentage of activated microglial cells was calculated .
a representative iba - 1 staining in the dentate gyrus area of tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - brains is shown in ( e ) , with arrows pointing to the activated microglial cells .
results are expressed as mean +/ - sem .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.005 vs tgapp mice ( student 's t test ) .
to determine whether pltp is involved in microglial phagocytosis , we used acute brain slices and determined phagocytosis using fbs - coated fluorescent latex beads .
microglial cells were identified by iba - 1 immunostaining .
three independent experiments were performed ; in each experiment one tgapp brain and one tgapp / pltp - / - brain were sliced , and results were analyzed by a paired student 's t test .
as shown in figure 7a and 7b ) , both the percentage of phagocytic cells (+ 40 % , p < 0.01 ) and the mean number of phagocytosed beads per microglial cell (+ 37 % , p < 0.005 ) were increased in brain slices from tgapp / pltp - / - compared to tgapp mice , resulting in an almost 2 - fold increase (+ 91 %) of the phagocytic index ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 7c ) .
figure 7 phagocytosis ability of microglial cells from tgapp and tgapp / pltp - / - mice phagocytosis experiments were conducted with acutely isolated brain slices .
slices were incubated with fbs - coated fluorescent latex microspheres for 60 min and phagocytic activity of microglial cells was determined after iba - 1 immunostaining .
the percentage of iba - 1 positive phagocytic cells ( a ) , the mean number of beads per microglial cell ( b ) , and the phagocytic index ( c ) were determined in brains slices from tgapp ( n = 3 ) and tgapp / pltp - / - ( n = 3 ) mice .

discussion the incidence of alzheimer 's disease is expected to double in the next 20 years and will contribute to heavy social and economic burden .
currently , no cure exists and with the recent failure of clinical trials of drugs targeting solely abeta , there is an urgent need to define new targets and develop alternative therapeutic strategies .
in the present study , we provide evidence that cerebral abeta peptide deposition is markedly reduced when pltp is deleted in a happ transgenic mouse model of ad , which can be explained by an increase in abeta clearance mechanisms .
there is growing evidence supporting the hypothesis that ad starts to develop due to an imbalance between abeta production and removal .
whereas familial early - onset ad appears primarily related to overproduction of abeta , sporadic late - onset ad may result from a dysfunction in the clearance system and / or the formation of hard - to - clear abeta aggregates [ 32 - 35 ] .
in the present study , we observed no difference in the expression of the human app transgene , and a small , non significant increase in abeta1 - 42 peptide levels were measured in soluble fractions of brain homogenates from tgapp / pltp - / - compared to tgapp animals .
these observations indicate that reduced expression or amyloidogenic processing of app are unlikely to account for the decreased amount of congo red - positive plaques in this transgenic setting .
tong et al. reported in another ad model that pltp deficiency is associated with a disrupted app turnover and an enhancement of the amyloidogenic pathway , leading to increased soluble abeta peptides and intracellular accumulation of abeta [ 36 ] .
although the reason of the discrepancy between these observations and our findings is not clear at this time , it is worthy of note that their study was conducted in three month - old animals , which corresponds to a very early stage of the amyloid pathology where amyloid deposition has not appeared yet ; moreover , as reported earlier for the membrane receptor trem2 [ 37 ] , there could be a stage - dependent differential effect of pltp on the pathology .
another hypothesis is that the discrepancy relies on differences in the promoter , expression and metabolism of the transgene product , human app protein , between the j20 ( pdgf promoter ) and app / ps1 ( thy1 promoter ) models .
interestingly , a differential effect of the genetic ablation of abca7 , a transmembrane lipid carrier , was also observed in the app / ps1 and j20 models .
thus , in 2013 , kim et al. reported that abca7 deficiency in j20 mice is associated with a reduced phagocytic capacity of microglial cells , affecting abeta clearance and leading to increased deposition .
they did not observe any alteration in app processing in this model .
one year later , sakae et al. reported that increased amyloidosis in app / ps1 mice with abca7 deficiency is associated with increased app processing and abeta formation , with no impact on its clearance [ 38 ] .
thus , one can hypothesize that due to intrinsic differences between the j20 and app / ps1 models , the impact of a genetic modification on app processing is not the same .
it is worthy of note that app processing is markedly accelerated in app / ps1 mice due to the presence of the ps1 transgene , which may interfere with the action of the endogenous cleaving enzymes and their modulators .
finally , the differences could also be explained by environmental factors in animal facilities modifying the immunological status of the animals .
more generally , it is important to keep in mind that results obtained using ad models should always be interpreted with caution , since each model , depending on how it was designed , provides a unique pathophysiological context , with its own specificities and limitations .
most importantly , species differences between rodents and humans in terms of neuroanatomy , genetics , behaviors , and immune functions force to limit extrapolations .
several clearance mechanisms tightly regulate abeta levels in the brain .
one of them relies on the action of specialized cells of the cns called microglia .
emerging evidence suggests that activated microglial cells can work as a double - edged sword with regards to neurodegeneration .
thus , they can either produce and secrete pro - inflammatory mediators ( including il - 1beta , tnf - alpha , and il - 6 ) , or instead release protective factors ( triggering anti - inflammatory and immunosuppressive responses ) and phagocytose abeta aggregates [ 39 , 40 ] .
the important role of microglia in the phagocytic clearance of abeta aggregates in ad mouse models and in abeta42 - immunized human ad patients has been clearly demonstrated ( for review , see [ 41 ]) .
recent human genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) and experimental studies have identified that functional microglia impairment would play a dominant role in the accumulation of amyloid plaques and the pathophysiology of ad [ 42 ] .
although pltp was mostly studied for its role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease , recent evidence suggests that it also plays a major role in inflammation and modulation of the immune response in the periphery .
pltp - deficient mice were shown to display an anti - inflammatory phenotype ( e.g. lower circulating levels of il - 6 ) [ 43 , 44 ] , and reduced expression level of il - 6 and infiltrating macrophages in aortic tissue of pltp - / - mice as compared to wild type mice was recently observed in an experimental model of abdominal aortic aneurysm [ 45 ] .
in macrophages , pltp exerts a direct anti - inflammatory role through direct interaction with the atp - binding cassette transporter a1 ( abca1 ) and subsequent activation of the jak2 / stat3 pathway [ 14 ] .
pltp also acts as an essential acute phase protein to suppress lps - induced inflammation in vivo and in vitro via its lps neutralization capacity [ 10 , 12 ] , and pltp - / - mice show increased mortality after lps injection compared to wild - type mice [ 11 ] .
in addition , reduced pltp expression or activity were shown to enhance the inflammatory response in cigarette smoke extract - exposed lung and small airway epithelial cells [ 46 ] .
pltp also modulates the acquired immune response , since our group recently demonstrated that pltp deficiency is associated with a shift of thelper ( th ) lymphocytes polarization towards the anti - inflammatory subset , th2 [ 13 ] .
in the present study , we provide the first evidence of an involvement of pltp in the modulation of innate immune reponses in the cns .
we showed that pltp deletion is associated with a shift in microglial cells phenotype towards the ameboid form , with a marked increase in their phagocytic capacity .
since a sharp reduction of amyloid deposits was observed in tgapp / pltp - / - compared to tgapp mice , our finding is in line with the current idea that switching microglia phenotype plays a dominant role in limiting the expansion of amyloid plaques [ 47 ] .
the reason why pltp modifies the phenotype of microglial cells is not clear at this time and will deserve further investigation .
our group previously demonstrated that peritoneal macrophages from pltp - deficient mice have an increased capacity to phagocytose oxidatively modified low - density lipoproteins and become foam cells , a property related to increased intracellular oxidative stress [ 9 ] .
since cerebral oxidative stress is significantly higher in pltp - deficient mice than in wt mice [ 5 ] , a similar mechanism may account for the increased ability of microglial cells to phagocytose abeta aggregates observed in the ad context .
interestingly , we measured a marked reduction of il - 6 level in brain homogenates from tgapp / pltp - / - compared to tgapp mice , which is concordant with earlier observations made in the periphery [ 43 , 44 ] .
il - 6 promotes microglial pro - inflammatory activities [ 48 ] and induces the synthesis of acute phase proteins [ 49 ] .
several studies have reported increased serum and plasma levels of il - 6 in patients with ad as compared to controls [ 50 , 51 ]. whether reduced il - 6 level is an endophenotype of pltp - deficient mice and contributes to the increased phagocytic potential of microglial cells , or whether it is a consequence of altered microglial polarization will warrant further investigation .
beyond microglial cells , several enzymes also participate to the degradation of abeta deposits in the brain .
among those enzymes are several zinc - proteases : neprilysin ( nep ) and the insulin - degrading enzyme ( ide ) .
during the ageing process , and under certain pathological conditions ( e.g. ischemia and stroke ) , the expression and activity of these enzymes decline , which leads to a deficit of abeta clearance and its accumulation in the brain .
in agreement with this notion , pharmacological inactivation [ 52 ] or genetic ablation [ 53 , 54 ] of nep in happ mice increased total abeta levels in the brain and plasma , whole brain and hippocampal levels of abeta dimers , abeta deposition , plaque - related pathology , deficits in synaptic plasticity , and impairments in hippocampus - dependent memory .
in contrast , viral vector - mediated [ 55 , 56 ] or transgene - mediated [ 57 , 58 ] overexpression of nep reduced cortical abeta levels , abeta deposition , and plaque - related pathology .
in the present study , we observed a significant increase in the mrna expression of nep in happtg / pltp - / - mice compared to happtg mice , which may also contribute to the reduced amyloid deposition .
we measured a significant decrease in apolipoprotein e levels in brain homogenates from tgapp / pltp - / - compared to tgapp mice .
this finding corroborates previous in vitro findings showing that pltp induces apolipoprotein e secretion in primary human astrocytes , and that csf apoe levels correlate with csf pltp activity [ 23 ] .
a direct interaction between apolipoprotein e and pltp , leading to pltp activation , has also been demonstrated , suggesting a strong functional link between the two proteins [ 59 ] .
apolipoprotein e is the primary genetic risk factor for the vast majority of sporadic , late - onset ad cases in the population .
although several mechanisms for the effect of the apoe4 variant on ad pathogenesis have been proposed , the primary pathway appears to be the differential effects of apoe isoforms on abeta aggregation and clearance [ 60 , 61 ] .
in addition to isoform status , it appears that the amount of apoe also plays a role in determining the extent of abeta accumulation in the brain .
there has been intense debate as to whether potential ad therapeutics should increase or decrease apoe levels .
based on the strong association between apoe and abeta in the brain , apoe was suggested as an abeta - binding protein that induces a pathological beta sheet conformational change in abeta [ 62 ] .
initial in vivo studies clearly indicated that the deletion of the endogenous murine apoe gene causes a dramatic decrease in fibrillar and total abeta deposition in app transgenic mouse models [ 63 - 65 ] .
recently , apoe was shown to interfere with the uptake of amyloid beta oligomers by astrocytes and fibrillar amyloid beta by microglial cells [ 66 ] .
thus , reduced apolipoprotein e concentration in the brain tissue of tgapp / pltp - / - mice is another feature that may contribute to the reduced accumulation of amyloid beta aggregates .
the finding that pltp deletion did not counteract memory deficits in the j20 mice despite a strong reduction of amyloid deposition might be due to the fact that soluble abeta levels were not significantly changed .
it is noteworthy however that although the findings did not reach statistical significance , pltp deficiency tends to improve nest building activity , an indicator of well - being and executive functioning .
it has been reported that memory loss and insoluble abeta aggregates were not connected in app transgenic mice ( tg2576 ) and transgenic mice co - expressing mutant presenilin - 1 and app , respectively , which suggested that earlier abeta aggregates disrupted cognition [ 67 - 69 ] .
in 2008 , long - term clinical follow - up , post - mortem neuropathological examination of abeta1 - 42 immunization in ad patients showed that although immunization with abeta1 - 42 resulted in reduction of amyloid plaques in patients with ad , this reduction did not prevent progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [ 70 ] .
thus , the notion that plaque loads are unreliable indicators of ad - related functional impairments is now widely accepted .
in the j20 model , memory impairment appears at the age of 2 months , well before amyloid deposition [ 24 ] , and is not dependent of disease progression , which suggests that in these mice like in other ad models , soluble multimeric forms of amyloid beta rather than amyloid deposits might initiate the synaptic and neuronal dysfunction leading to cognitive decline [ 68 ] .
in summary , we have shown that pltp deletion is associated with a significant reduction of abeta deposits and astrogliosis in the brain .
this phenotype can be explained at least in part by a rise of abeta clearance through an increase in the microglial phagocytic activity and the expression of nep .
our findings suggest that pltp acts as a negative determinant of plaque clearance and that over the lifespan , elevated pltp activity could lead to a higher abeta load in the brain .
in line with the present study , it would be worthwhile to determine the impact of pltp overexpression in ad mice on amyloid deposition and cognitive functions .
materials and methods animals hemizygous happswind transgenic ( j20 ) mice [ 24 ] were purchased from the jackson laboratories , and pltp - / - mice were generated as described by jiang et al .

abundant inflammatory macrophages destruct tissues , leading to atherosclerosis , myocardial infarction and heart failure .
emerging therapeutic options create interest in monitoring macrophages in patients .
here we describe positron emission tomography ( pet ) imaging with 18f - macroflor , a modified polyglucose nanoparticle with high avidity for macrophages .
due to its small size , macroflor is excreted renally , a prerequisite for imaging with the isotope flourine - 18 .
the particle 's short blood half - life , measured in three species , including a primate , enables macrophage imaging in inflamed cardiovascular tissues .
macroflor enriches in cardiac and plaque macrophages , thereby increasing pet signal in murine infarcts and both mouse and rabbit atherosclerotic plaques .
in pet / magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) experiments , macroflor pet imaging detects changes in macrophage population size while molecular mri reports on increasing or resolving inflammation .
these data suggest that macroflor pet / mri could be a clinical tool to non - invasively monitor macrophage biology .
in vivo imaging of inflammation is crucial for detection and monitoring of many pathologies and noninvasive macrophage quantification has been suggested as a possible approach .
here keliher et al. describe novel polyglucose nanoparticle tracers that are rapidly excreted by the kidney and with high affinity for macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques .
ischaemic heart disease leads worldwide mortality statistics1 .
while conventional risk factors such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension are well understood and effectively treated , the atherosclerosis disease burden keeps growing .
macrophage function is increasingly seen as therapeutically interesting , as per genome - wide association studies showing inflammation - related mutations in patients with myocardial infarction ( mi ) 2 and fundamental immunology discoveries .
data obtained from animals with cardiovascular disease suggest that surplus inflammatory macrophages in either the arterial wall or ischaemic heart muscle promote tissue destruction , morbidity and death3 .
in patients , most available evidence focuses on blood monocytes , which are macrophage precursors that are easy to assay with existing technology .
however , because tissue macrophage numbers and phenotypes do not necessarily correlate with blood monocytes , we need to directly survey vascular and cardiac tissues .
in preclinical research , intravital microscopy and flow cytometry enable tissue macrophage quantification4 .
yet it is not practical to biopsy atherosclerotic blood vessels and infarcted or failing hearts in patients .
quantitative macrophage imaging , currently unavailable for clinical applications , would overcome this barrier , provide better understanding of macrophages' roles in human disease , identify patients at risk for complications and evaluate emerging macrophage - targeting therapeutics .
nanoparticles , which can be efficiently internalized by phagocytic myeloid cells5 , are a promising strategy for quantitatively and specifically imaging macrophages in human cardiovascular organs .
previously developed nanoparticles with effective macrophage uptake also have long circulation times with high blood pool activity that limit target - to - background ratios in the vascular system .
further , the long circulation times precluded the use of the clinically facile 18f pet isotope for nanoparticle tracking , because the radioisotope decays faster ( t1 / 2 110 min ) than nanoparticles exit from the blood pool adjacent to the imaging target , that is , diseased cardiovascular tissues .
to solve these problems , we shrank nanoparticles to a size below the renal excretion threshold6 and optimized biological behaviour through biocompatible chemistries .
here we describe a class of modified polyglucose nanoparticles that we named macrins .
more specifically , macrins are a class of lysine - crosslinked low molecular weight carboxymethyl polyglucose polymers , each containing 22 glucose units .
macrins can be considered glycogen biomimetics that lack the central glycogenic core .
for our imaging applications , we labelled a 5 nm macrin with either 18f to create a positron emission tomography ( pet ) imaging agent ( termed macroflor ) or a fluorochrome for correlative studies .
in three animal species , we confirm rapid renal excretion of macroflor and also show its high affinity for macrophages residing in cardiovascular organs .
in a number of imaging experiments , this approach provides quantitative and specific pet data on inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque and ischaemic myocardium .
results small nanoparticles are excreted renally macroflor synthesis relied on the commercial building blocks carboxymethylated polyglucose ( with an average chain length of 22 ) and l - lysine crosslinked through amide bond formation ( fig. 1a ) .
a carbohydrate assay determined that macroflor particles were composed of 40 % polyglucose and 60 % lysine .
optimizing chemical stoichiometry and reaction time yielded a mean particle diameter of 5.0 +/ - 0.4 nm ( fig. 1b ) , which is small enough to allow renal excretion .
chemical characterization of macroflor documented 23 nmol free amines per mg and 62 nmol azides per mg , providing two strategies for derivatization with imaging beacons .
free amines were capped by reaction with excess succinic anhydride , which shifted the zeta potential from - 11.1 to - 19.9 +/ - 1.0 mv , thereby indicating a change in the surface charge .
succinylation did not change particle size .
macroflor was radiolabelled with 18f with high radiochemical purity ( fig. 1c ) .
the average specific activity was 10.2 +/ - 1.9 mci mg - 1 .
macroflor was first tested in healthy mice ( fig. 1d,e ) and rabbits ( fig. 1f ) .
in both species , the highest activity occurred in the kidneys , while uptake in liver and spleen was considerably lower , as measured 120 min after injection .
together with the rapid clearance from the blood pool ( fig. 1d , blood half - life of 6.5 min measured in five normal mice and 22.5 min measured in four normal rabbits ) , these data indicate that macroflor is rapidly cleared from circulation by the renal system .
macroflor stability in mouse serum was tested by size exclusion radiochromatography .
the data indicate that macroflor is stable for 120 min with no appearance of additional peaks ( supplementary fig. 1 ) .
to test if similarly rapid renal excretion occurs in primates , we conducted a dynamic imaging experiment using a clinical pet / magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scanner ( fig. 2a - c ) .
macroflor , 2.5 mci , was injected intravenously , followed by 90 min of pet data acquisition .
as anticipated , macroflor rapidly departed the blood pool and accumulated in the kidneys and bladder ( fig. 2a,b ) .
fitting the blood pool activity yielded a blood half - life of 21.7 min ( fig. 2c ) .
thus , data obtained in all three species document rapid renal excretion of macroflor .
to explore macroflor uptake by macrophages , we used dynamic intravital confocal microscopy to study the hearts of cx3cr1gfp /+ mice .
in naive hearts , no signal was seen in the 680 nm channel , but cardiac macrophages were brightly green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) positive ( fig. 2d ) .
shortly after the fluorescent nanoparticle was injected into the tail vein , intravascular signal appeared in cardiac vessels .
while blood pool signal faded rapidly thereafter , we observed nanoparticle enrichment in cardiac macrophages ( fig. 2d,e ) .
these data imply that the nanoparticles undergo rapid distribution to macrophages , and that these nanoparticles are cleared from the blood pool within a time frame that enables 18f pet imaging of macrophages residing in cardiovascular tissues .
to test the hypothesis that macrolite enters macrophages via a biologically active process , we studied in vitro uptake into primary cells harvested from mouse spleens at different temperatures .
splenocytes were incubated with the fluorescently labelled nanoparticle macrolite for 15 min and 12 h at either 4 or 37 degreesc .
uptake of macrolite was assessed by flow cytometry , which also identified macrophages by their typical surface marker profile .
we found substantial macrolite uptake only in the cells that were incubated at 37 degreesc , indicating that nanoparticle uptake is inhibited if the cells are on ice ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
these data indicate that macrolite uptake is a biologically active process .
imaging inflammatory atherosclerosis macrophages enter arterial wall segments to remove cholesterol deposits .
in patients and animals with atherosclerosis , the cells fail in this task and instead create sub - endothelial inflammatory lesions .
continued recruitment and local proliferation feed macrophage population growth , which perpetuates inflammation and swells lesions that impede blood flow .
macrophages also destabilize arterial tissue integrity by secreting proteolytic and pro - inflammatory enzymes , which can lead to atherosclerotic plaque disruption , thrombotic arterial occlusion and sudden downstream ischemia .
this makes macrophages a potential therapeutic target and indicates the need to monitor them .
in apoe - / - mice on pro - atherogenic diet , we observed macroflor enrichment in the aortic root and arch ( fig. 3a,b ) , vascular territories that are affected by inflammatory atherosclerosis .
standard uptake values obtained by pet / computed tomography ( ct ) imaging 120 min after intravenous injection of 525 +/ - 167 muci macroflor were significantly increased in mice with atherosclerosis ( fig. 3c ) .
these in vivo data correlated well with activity measured in excised aortae ( fig. 3d,e ) .
using autoradiography exposure of aortae , we detected radioactivity co - localized with fatty atherosclerotic plaques ( fig. 3f ) .
the nanoparticle 's uptake profile into cells that reside in the aortic wall showed a significant predilection for macrophages , while other leukocytes such as lymphocytes and neutrophils showed negligible nanoparticle incorporation ( fig. 3g - i ) .
immunofluorescent labelling of the myeloid marker cd11b , which is highly expressed by macrophages , co - localized with nanoparticles in histological sections of aortic plaques ( fig. 3j ) .
we next explored macroflor imaging of atherosclerosis in rabbits using a clinical pet / mri scanner .
ninety minutes after macroflor injection , we observed high pet signal in the rabbits' kidneys ( fig. 4a,b ) , thereby confirming macroflor 's renal excretion .
significantly increased pet signal localized into the infrarenal aortae of rabbits that developed atherosclerotic lesions therein after exposure to atherogenic diet and infrarenal aortic ballon injury ( fig. 4a,c ) .
in a cohort of rabbits that received balloon injury with intermediate pressure , aortic standard uptake values were higher than in the control cohort but lower than in rabbits that received full - pressure endothelial denudation ( fig. 4c ) .
autoradiography on excised aortae documented radioactivity in a pattern reflecting atherosclerotic lesion distribution ( fig. 4d ) .
ex vivo scintillation counting of excised rabbit aortae revealed increased activity in rabbits with atherosclerotic disease ( fig. 4f ) .
two days before macroflor imaging , rabbits underwent 18f - fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18f - fdg ) pet to enable comparison .
the rabbit cohorts had similar pet signal distributions ( fig. 4f ) .
when aortic segments were studied , 18f - fdg and 18f - nanoparticle signal correlated with an r2 = 0.518 ( p < 0.0001 , pearson correlation coefficient , fig. 4g ) .
the difference in myocardial uptake between macroflor and 18f - fdg , shown in fig. 4h and supplementary fig. 3 may have implications for cardiac pet inflammation imaging .
pet imaging of macrophages in acute mi ischaemic organ injury profoundly expands the macrophage pool .
the cells derive from blood monocytes made in the bone marrow and spleen but also proliferate locally in the infarct7 .
macrophage numbers peak around day 3 after ischemia , before tissues transition to resolution of inflammation .
during the resolution phase , macrophages assume less inflammatory phenotypes and promote tissue repair .
however , their overabundance , or a delayed phenotype transition , promotes heart failure .
infarct macrophages are , therefore , a potential therapeutic target , but we currently lack tools for monitoring them quantitatively .
to explore macroflor pet imaging after mi , we imaged mice with permanent coronary ligation .
in vivo imaging showed macroflor uptake into the ischaemic myocardium ( fig. 5a,b ) to be significantly higher than myocardial standard uptake values in control mice without mi ( fig. 5c ) .
these in vivo data were corroborated by scintillation counting ( fig. 5d ) and autoradiography exposure ( fig. 5e ) of excised mouse hearts .
flow cytometric evaluation of cardiac leukocytes showed significant enrichment in macrophages ( fig. 5f - h ) .
dual targeted pet / mri reports on phenotype and number macrophages may not only change in number but also shift their phenotypes and inflammatory activities .
a change in macrophage phenotype occurs when infarct inflammation transitions to resolution on day 3 in wild - type mice with permanent coronary ligation .
in mice and patients with inflammatory co - morbidities such as pre - existing atherosclerosis , oversupply of inflammatory myeloid cells compromises resolution and leads to post - mi heart failure because inflammatory macrophage phenotypes impede tissue regeneration .
consequently , monitoring macrophage numbers and phenotypes is vital to furthering our understanding of ischaemic heart disease .
recently - developed pet / mri systems can image more than one target simultaneously by combining two imaging agents detectable with either pet or mri .
we here combined macroflor pet imaging with mri sensing of myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) , an enzyme expressed by inflammatory macrophages .
we previously validated the gadolinium ( gd ) - based , activatable enzyme reporter mpo - gd for infarct imaging8 and found the signal to be specific for inflammatory myeloid cells , especially neutrophils and the inflammatory l6chigh monocyte subset9 .
we tested dual - target pet / mr imaging at two time points after acute mi. the first imaging occurred on day 2 after coronary ligation , which coincides with the inflammatory phase characterized by an abundance of inflammatory neutrophils , monocytes and macrophage subsets ( fig. 6a ) .
the second imaging session was on day 6 ( fig. 6b ) , which coincides with the resolution phase of infarct healing , when reparative macrophage phenotypes support tissue healing via crosstalk with fibroblasts and endothelial cells in sprouting neo - vessels .
the pet standard uptake value for reporting macrophage numbers increased between day 2 and day 6 ( fig. 6c ) , a change that indicates an expanding macrophage pool in the healing infarct .
the increase in macroflor pet signal correlates well with previous flow cytometric studies documenting rising macrophage numbers between days 2 and 6 after mi710 .
the data also imply that macrophages of different phenotypes readily incorporate macroflor .
concomitantly , we observed declining mri mpo signal ( fig. 6d ) .
thus , while the macrophage population expanded , the cells produced less mpo , a dynamic that is consistent with infarct inflammation switching to resolution .
this sensing strategy could identify at - risk individuals that do not undergo phenotype switching .
finally , we tested dual - target pet / mri in mouse atherosclerosis .
figure 6e illustrates the activation and retainment of mpo - gd in the aortic root , a site of inflammatory atherosclerosis in apoe - / - mice consuming a pro - atherogenic diet .
after mpo - gd injection , the contrast - to - noise ratio rose significantly ( fig. 6f ) .
immunostaining for mpo demonstrated its presence in the region of interest ( fig. 6g ) .
to provide contrast with the macrophage resolution phenotype observed in day 6 infarcts , we subjected apoe - / - mice to coronary ligation , which promotes disease - exacerbating inflammation systemically and in plaques11 .
ex vivo histology and flow cytometry previously documented that acute mi accelerates atherosclerosis in mice .
comparing litter mate apoe - / - mice with and without mi , we detected not only increased macroflor pet signal but also increased mpo - gd retention by mri .
increased signal in both imaging channels indicates that macrophage numbers expanded but without the resolution documented by lower mpo - gd retention in the 6 day old infarct ; indeed , plaque inflammation flared .
ex vivo scintillation counting confirmed a higher macroflor uptake in aortic specimens harvested from mice after mi ( fig. 6k ) .
in the clinic , such an integrated imaging strategy may identify disease - promoting inflammatory incidents .
discussion imaging cardiovascular targets has specific challenges because the tissues are in direct contact with the blood pool in which the imaging probe circulates .
macrophages , cells with high pathophysiological relevance , internalize nanoparticles that can deliver isotopes , fluorochromes or rare earth metal to be detected by nuclear , optical and mri .
among those modalities , pet is uniquely quantitative , and in the clinic , 18f is the most commonly used isotope .
until now , slow hepatic nanoparticle elimination impeded pet macrophage imaging with 18f labelled particles , as the isotope decay usually outpaces nanoparticle elimination from the blood pool .
here we describe how macroflor , a polyglucose nanoparticle shrunk to a size below the renal excretion threshold , solves this problem .
though it is excreted within minutes , macroflor 's high avidity for macrophages makes it a suitable pet agent for imaging these cells .
because macroflor 's synthesis relies on sugar molecules and uses facile click labelling for pet isotope attachment , it is highly suitable for clinical translation .
sensitive imaging tools , including optical detection of fluorescent proteins expressed under control of macrophage - specific promoters , recently revealed macrophage presence and density in cardiovascular and other organs .
in the steady state , these cells pursue surveillance and defense .
one of their prime activities , phagocytosis of dying cells , infectious agents and other foreign material , also results in avid nanoparticle uptake .
macrophages expand by orders of magnitude in injured and diseased tissue , and depending on their numbers and inflammatory properties , macrophages may promote healing or disease .
in cardiovascular organs , overabundance of inflammatory macrophages damages vascular and cardiac structures , ultimately leading to ischemia , stroke , heart failure and death3 .
thus , macrophages are being explored as therapeutic targets in heart disease and many other pathologies .
but because macrophages also pursue salutary functions in tissue repair and defense , broadly targeting macrophages may have deleterious effects .
as a consequence , imaging tools for monitoring macrophages or their functions will likely be companion strategies during drug development .
different imaging strategies for monitoring macrophages have been proposed , comprising imaging of adhesion molecules , cell surface receptors and secreted factors executing inflammatory functions4 .
these strategies likely differ in their sensitivity and specificity for macrophage presence , phenotype target range and pharmacokinetics .
some approaches may be sensitive for early cell activation , such as imaging of alarmins12 , while others , including pet imaging of macroflor enrichment , report on macrophages in all inflammatory stages , even on non - inflammatory tissue resident cells .
we envision that macroflor will enable detection of increased macrophage numbers in cardiovascular organs and monitor the cell population size as a function of therapy .
large animal infarct imaging is required next , since pet imaging in mouse thoracotomy infarct model reaches limitations in terms of spatially distinguishing inflammation in the body wall from myocardial injury .
when combined with an mr imaging agent , dual - target data may additionally report on orthogonal biomarkers that reflect macrophage phenotypes .
cardiovascular 18f - fdg pet detected arterial and myocardial inflammation in several preclinical studies131415 and clinical trials16171819202122 .
we , therefore , correlated 18f - fdg and macroflor uptake in rabbits with atherosclerosis .
the data show imaging agent overlap .
in rabbits with atherosclerosis13 and in human endarterectomy specimens17 , 18f - fdg associates with macrophages detected by histology , which supports the correlation we observed between macroflor and 18f - fdg .
however , the 0.518 correlation coefficient suggests that both agents behave distinctly .
for example , if not sufficiently suppressed with appropriate measures , 18f - fdg enriches in cardiomyocytes , especially if these are distressed23 .
this consideration may be relevant for imaging the myocardium and coronary arteries .
we observed negligible myocyte uptake of macroflor , perhaps dictated by the different distribution and tissue penetration of small molecule and nanoparticle based pet imaging agents .
the favourable macroflor uptake profile for macrophages and its rapid pharmacokinetics motivate our next translational steps , which include imaging in large animals and toxicology in preparation for first - in - human studies .

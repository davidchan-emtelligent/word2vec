this paper describes a fully - automated system ( auto diss ( r )) for the determination of active ingredient release of solid oral dosage forms according to the paddle method of the us pharmacopoeia ( usp ) and european pharmacopoeia .
twenty batches can be tested continuously , with the six individuals ( tablets , capsules etc. ) of one batch being examined synchronous .
the components of the auto diss ( r ) system are presented and the operating steps of automatic filling with dissolution medium , dropping in of tablets , sampling and cleaning of vessels are described .
suitability for testing controlled - release drugs by means of automated buffer change from simulated gastric fluid to simulated intestinal fluid according to usp is also demonstrated .
on - line determination of active ingredient concentration , as well as evaluation and documentation of measured values , is possible using an integrated automatic sampler in combination with various measuring instruments .
the auto diss ( r ) system is shown to be both rugged and accurate .

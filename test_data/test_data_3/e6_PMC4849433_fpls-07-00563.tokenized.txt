global climate changes inversely affect our ability to grow the food required for an increasing world population .
to combat future crop loss due to abiotic stress , we need to understand the signals responsible for changes in plant development and the resulting adaptations , especially the signaling molecules traveling long - distance through the plant phloem .
using a proteomics approach , we had identified several putative lipid - binding proteins in the phloem exudates .
simultaneously , we identified several complex lipids as well as jasmonates .
these findings prompted us to propose that phloem ( phospho - ) lipids could act as long - distance developmental signals in response to abiotic stress , and that they are released , sensed , and moved by phloem lipid - binding proteins ( benning et al. , 2012 ) .
indeed , the proteins we identified include lipases that could release a signaling lipid into the phloem , putative receptor components , and proteins that could mediate lipid - movement .
to test this possible protein - based lipid - signaling pathway , three of the proteins , which could potentially act in a relay , are characterized here : ( i ) a putative gdsl - motif lipase ( ii ) a pig - p - like protein , with a possible receptor - like function ; ( iii ) and plafp ( phloem lipid - associated family protein ) , a predicted lipid - binding protein of unknown function .
here we show that all three proteins bind lipids , in particular phosphatidic acid ( ptdoh ) , which is known to participate in intracellular stress signaling .
genes encoding these proteins are expressed in the vasculature , a prerequisite for phloem transport .
cellular localization studies show that the proteins are not retained in the endoplasmic reticulum but surround the cell in a spotted pattern that has been previously observed with receptors and plasmodesmatal proteins .
abiotic signals that induce the production of ptdoh also regulate the expression of gdsl - lipase and plafp , albeit in opposite patterns .
our findings suggest that while all three proteins are indeed lipid - binding and act in the vasculature possibly in a function related to long - distance signaling , the three proteins do not act in the same but rather in distinct pathways .
it also points toward plafp as a prime candidate to investigate long - distance lipid signaling in the plant drought response .

this is aggravated by an encroachment of cities on arable land , competition between food and fuel crops , and the impact of global climate changes on crop yields .
abiotic factors such as drought , heat , and cold commonly affect crop yield .
to continuously provide sufficient food and fuel for the increasing world population , we need plants with accelerated growth , higher yields , and increased stress tolerance .
since plants are sessile and cannot escape adverse conditions , it is essential to understand how plants perceive environmental changes and how they transmit the signals that convey developmental changes and the resulting adaptations .
this requires intracellular and long - distance signaling .
the plant long - distance transport systems are the xylem and the phloem .
the two main components for phloem transport are sieve elements and companion cells .
to enhance transport of molecules through the sieve elements , they optimize the longitudinal flow in these cells by degrading any obstacles in the form of organelles and ribosomes , leaving only the plasma membrane and a thin cytoplasm which contains er , phloem - specific plastids , and a few dilated mitochondria ( van bel and knoblauch , 2000 ; turgeon and wolf , 2009 ) .
the residual er is found near the plasmodesmata which connect the sieve elements with the companion cells .
it is thought to participate in controlling and mediating the trafficking of proteins and other molecules from the companion cell , where they are synthesized , into the sieve element for long - distance movement ( lucas et al. , 2009 , 2013 ) .
transport of photoassimilates as well as signaling molecules is thought to occur from source ( photosynthetically active , mature leaves ) to sink ( immature leaves , roots , fruits , flowers , etc. ) in a mechanism driven by the osmotic gradient (" pressure flow hypothesis " ; munch , 1930 ; for a review see froelich et al. , 2011 ; lucas et al. , 2013 ) .
our understanding of the phloem has evolved from simple assimilate movement to a complex trafficking system for environmental - and stress signals as well as developmental regulators ( citovsky and zambryski , 2000 ; ding et al. , 2003 ; wu et al. , 2003 ; haywood et al. , 2005 ; lucas et al. , 2013 ) in the form of small molecules ( chen et al. , 2001 ; corbesier et al. , 2003 ) , proteins ( fisher et al. , 1992 ; schobert et al. , 1995 ; kuhn et al. , 1997 ; marentes and grusak , 1998 ; kehr et al. , 1999 ; xoconostle - cazares et al. , 1999 ; haebel and kehr , 2001 ; hoffmann - benning et al. , 2002 ; giavalisco et al. , 2006 ; lin et al. , 2009 ; guelette et al. , 2012 ; champigny et al. , 2013 ) , nucleic acids ( ruiz - medrano et al. , 1999 ; citovsky and zambryski , 2000 ; ding et al. , 2003 ; yoo et al. , 2004 ; haywood et al. , 2005 ; pant et al. , 2008 ; buhtz et al. , 2010 ; varkonyi - gesic et al. , 2010 ; rodriguez - medina et al. , 2011 ; hannapel et al. , 2013 ; pallas and gomez , 2013 ) , and lipophilic molecules , including complex lipids such as steroids and phospholipids ( madey et al. , 2002 ; behmer et al. , 2011 , 2013 ; guelette et al. , 2012 ) .
using proteomics approaches , we along with others have identified several putative lipid - binding proteins in the phloem of several plant species as diverse as perilla , lupine , arabidopsis , broccoli , canola , several cucurbits , poplar , and rice ( table 1 ; hoffmann - benning et al. , 2002 ; walz et al. , 2004 ; giavalisco et al. , 2006 ; aki et al. , 2008 ; dafoe et al. , 2009 ; lin et al. , 2009 ; cho et al. , 2010 ; rodriguez - medina et al. , 2011 ; guelette et al. , 2012 ; anstead et al. , 2013 ; lattanzio et al. , 2013 ; tetyuk et al. , 2013 ; du et al. , 2015 ) .

the questions arise : what is the function of the phloem lipids ?
how are they solubilized and transported in this aqueous environment ? and what is the role of the phloem lipid - binding proteins in this process ?
our findings led us to propose that phloem ( phospho - ) lipids could act in long - distance developmental signaling in response to abiotic stress : they could facilitate perception by tethering a signaling molecule , receptor , or secondary messenger to the membrane .
alternatively , they could be ( part of ) a signal themselves .
as such they are released , sensed , and moved by phloem lipid - binding proteins ( benning et al. , 2012 ; hoffmann - benning , 2015 ; barbaglia and hoffmann - benning , 2016 ) .
indeed , the proteins we identified include lipases , that could release the signaling lipid into the phloem , putative receptor components , and proteins that could mediate lipid - movement .
the presence of lipids in an aqueous environment is not without precedence in biological systems : cholesterol is either taken up into cells and incorporated into membranes , or it is moved to the liver for degradation .
its fate depends on the lipoproteins to which it is bound ( for a summary see nelson et al. , 2008 ) .
other examples of the lipid movement and signaling are ( i ) the developmental regulator wnt in animals , which requires palmitoleic acid for binding to the receptor frizzled ( frz ; janda et al. , 2012 ) ; ( ii ) the platelet activation factor is a phospholipid , which controls platelet aggregation and inflammation ( christie , 2014 ) ; ( iii ) the regulation of the beta - oxidation by fatty acids via the transcription factor pparalpha1 ( wahli and michalik , 2012 ) .
clearly , lipids can act in long - distance signaling using protein - facilitated mechanisms .
the type of protein to which a lipid binds not only determines its transport but also its fate as well as downstream regulatory processes .
despite the fact that these lipid - protein signaling mechanisms are essential for mammalian health and development , their significance in plants is virtually unexplored .
phloem lipids range from small lipophilic molecules ( jung et al. , 2009 ; chanda et al. , 2011 ; chaturvedi et al. , 2012 ; shah et al. , 2014 ) to lipophilic hormones ( wu et al. , 2003 ; behmer et al. , 2013 ; lucas et al. , 2013 ) to ( phospho - ) glycerolipids ( madey et al. , 2002 ; guelette et al. , 2012 ; for a summary see hoffmann - benning , 2015 ) .
small lipophilic molecules such as oxylipins , dehydroabietinal , a glycerol - 3 - phosphate - derivative , and azelaic acid ( aza ) are studied mostly in the context of biotic stress and systemic acquired resistance ( sar ; howe and schilmiller , 2002 ; chaturvedi and shah , 2007 ; jung et al. , 2009 ; chanda et al. , 2011 ; chaturvedi et al. , 2012 ; shah et al. , 2014 ) .
the oxylipin jasmonate ( ja ) is synthesized in response to wounding or herbivory .
it moves throughout the plant as its isoleucine ( ile ) - or methyl - ester and elicits a ( systemic ) defense response ( howe and schilmiller , 2002 ; thorpe et al. , 2007 ; truman et al. , 2007 ; mandal et al. , 2011 ; matsuura et al. , 2012 ; tamogami et al. , 2012 ) .
moreover , a role for the ja - precursor 12 - oxo - phytodienoic acid in response to drought and crosstalk with aba has been suggested ( savchenko et al. , 2014 ) .
behmer et al .
( 2011 , 2013 ) detected free , acylated , and glycosylated derivatives of cholesterol , sitosterol , campesterol , and stigmasterol in the phloem .
phospholipids act as intracellular signals regulating development as well as the response to biotic and abiotic stress ( zhu , 2002 ; wang et al. , 2007 ; munnik and testerink , 2009 ; wang and chapman , 2012 ; gillaspy , 2013 ; ischebeck et al. , 2013 ; hung et al. , 2014 ) .
one of these , phosphatidic acid is generated in the plasma membrane in response to several environmental stresses and aba via phospholipases d or c and partakes in intracellular signal transduction ( welti et al. , 2002 ; wang et al. , 2007 ; munnik and testerink , 2009 ; mcloughlin and testerink , 2013 ) .
however , the concept of phospholipids as long - distance signals has not been investigated and provides a novel aspect in lipid signaling .
to test possible protein - based lipid - signaling pathways , three phloem lipid - binding proteins , which could potentially act in a relay , are characterized here : a putative gdsl - motif lipase that may release lipids into the phloem ; a putative pig - p protein , with a predicted role in gpi - anchor synthesis and thus , receptor biosynthesis ; plafp ( phloem lipid - associated family protein ) , a putative lipid - binding protein of unknown function .
gdsl esterases / lipases are part of a subfamily of hydrolytic / lipolytic enzymes .
they contain a distinct glycine - aspartic acid - serine - leucine ( gdsl ) motif and have a flexible active site that changes conformation in the presence of different substrates .
this flexible active site leads to a broader substrate - and regiospecificity .
it is situated near the n - terminus , while the active site of other lipases is located near the center of the protein ( akoh et al. , 2004 ) .
gdsl lipases play a role in seed germination ( ling et al. , 2006 ) , plant growth and morphogenesis ( brick et al. , 1995 ) , and pathogen response ( lee and cho , 2003 ; hong et al. , 2008 ; oh et al. , 2005 ) .
atglip2 plays a role in pathogen defense against erwinia carotovora through the negative regulation of auxin signaling ( lee et al. , 2009 ) .
the pig - p - like protein is a protein of unknown function with similarity to one subunit of the yeast and human phosphatidylinositol n - acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit p ( pig - p ) of the gpi - n - acetylglucosaminyltransferase .
the human enzyme transfers n - acetylglucosamine from udp - n - acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol and assists in the gpi - anchor formation ( watanabe et al. , 2000 ) .
however , it is much smaller than the putative atpig - p , thus their functions are not necessarily related .
pig - p has several homologs in other plants , all containing a duf4378 at the carboxy - terminus that is shared with the yeast and human pig - p and could contain the lipid - binding site .
the remainder of the plant proteins shows no similarity to any known protein and may have a novel and plant - specific function .
the phloem lipid - associated family protein ( plafp ) is a small putative lipid - binding protein of unknown function .
it contains a plat / lh2 domain , which is thought to mediate interaction with lipids or membrane - bound proteins ( bateman and sandford , 1999 ) .
proteins containing the plat / lh2 domain are typically stress - induced ( bona et al. , 2007 ; mhaske et al. , 2013 ) .
the presence of the plat domain has led to the annotation of this protein as a lipase or lipoxygenase , however , plafp lacks the catalytic site , suggesting a different function .
hyun et al .
( 2014 ) proposed a function in the er stress response ; however , we could not confirm any association with the er ( see section localization of protein and promoter activity of gdsl - lipase , plafp , and pig - p ) .
we have shown that plafp specifically binds phosphatidic acid ( benning et al. , 2012 ; see figure 1c or figure 1e ) , a membrane lipid known to participate in intracellular signaling in response to several stresses ( wang , 2005 ; wang et al. , 2006 ; testerink and munnik , 2011 ; arisz et al. , 2013 ) .

( d , g ) shows the presence of gdsl - lipase in either pellet or supernatant after incubation with liposomes containing either ptdcho ( negative control ) , dag , or a mixture .
presence of a band in the pellet indicates binding of the protein to the lipids .
e and f show the presence of plafp and pig - p , respectively , in the pellets of liposomes containing ptdoh ( plafp and pig - p ) and ptdser ( pig - p ) but not if liposomes contain ptdcho alone .

to participate in any long - distance function , the proteins need to be expressed in the vasculature of the plant .
a previous analysis of the phloem translatome by mustroph et al .
( 2009 ) suggested expression of plafp and the putative gdsl - motif lipase in phloem companion cells .
our study here goes beyond the proteomics approach that identified putative lipid - binding proteins in the phloem and provides a functional analysis of three candidates in the context of lipid binding and signaling in response to environmental signals .
our findings show that all three proteins are indeed lipid - binding ( figure 1 ) , bind to the same lipid ( ptdoh ) , act in the vasculature ( table 1 ; figure 3 ) , and respond to ptdoh - mediated stresses ( figure 4 ) ; however , their different response to environmental factors suggests that the three proteins likely do not act in the same pathway .

results the predicted phloem lipid - binding proteins gdsl - lipase , plafp , and pig - p - like protein bind lipids the plant phloem contains several putative lipid - binding proteins ( table 1 ) as well as lipids ( guelette et al. , 2012 ) .
to participate in any lipid - based signaling pathway , these proteins need to bind specific lipids , including lipids that can be found in phloem exudates .
protein - lipid overlay assays ( figures 1a - c ) suggest a strong interaction of the putative gdsl - lipase with diacylglycerol , phosphatidyl - inositol - 3,4,5 - trisphosphate ( ptdinsp3 ) and a weak interaction with phosphatidic acid ( ptdoh ) ; the putative pig - p shows interaction with phosphatidylserine ( ptdser ) , phosphatidyl - inositol - 4 - phosphate ( ptdinsp1 ) , and ptdoh ; plafp specifically binds ptdoh .
the lipid - binding seen in the protein - lipid overlay was confirmed using independent liposome - binding assays : the purified putative lipid - binding protein was incubated with liposomes consisting of lipids that had been identified in the overlay assay .
proteins that bind to the liposomes of a specific lipid composition can be detected in the ( liposome - containing ) pellet ( figures 1d - g , respectively ) , while proteins that do not bind to the liposomes are found in the supernatant ( illustrated in figure 1d ) .
ptdcho - liposomes were used as negative controls as none of the proteins showed interaction with ptdcho in the protein - lipid overlay .
as figure 1d illustrates , gdsl - lipase is not detected in the pellets containing liposomes that contain dag or ptdcho , or a mixture thereof .
however , it is detected in the supernatant .
different compositions of dag - containing liposomes were used , none of which interacted with the lipase .
on the other hand , the gdsl - lipase does associate with ptdoh - containing liposomes ( figure 1g ) .
since the binding to ptdoh in the protein - lipid overlay assay was weak an increased amount of protein ( 10 mug ) was used for figure 1g , showing that in addition to binding ptdoh , there is a weak interaction with ptdcho .
together this indicates that the lipase binds preferentially to ptdoh .
figure 1e illustrates that plafp does not bind to liposomes consisting solely of ptdcho .
however , when ptdoh was included in the liposome , plafp bound .
the amount of protein bound increased with the ptdoh content of the liposomes .
similarly , pig - p binds to liposomes containing ptdoh or ptdser but not to liposomes consisting exclusively of ptdcho ( figure 1f ) .
these liposome binding studies confirmed binding of ptdoh to plafp , pig - p , and gdsl - lipase as well as binding of ptdser to the pig - p - like protein .
binding to ptdinsp3 was not tested since this lipid has so far not been reported in plants and is , thus , not of biological relevance ( munnik and testerink , 2009 ) .
our results demonstrate that all three proteins are indeed lipid - binding proteins .
most importantly , they all bind ptdoh albeit with different intensities .
ptdoh is one of the lipids that was found in the phloem ( benning et al. , 2012 ; guelette et al. , 2012 ) and that is already known to participate in intracellular signaling ( wang et al. , 2007 ; xue et al. , 2009 ; hong et al. , 2010 ; kim et al. , 2013 ; mcloughlin and testerink , 2013 ) .
thus , these findings suggest the possibility that all three proteins function in a ptdoh - related signaling path .
localization of protein and promoter activity of gdsl - lipase , plafp , and pig - p during the development of the phloem , many organelles and the nuclei of the sieve elements disintegrate to allow for an unobstructed flow of molecules ( lucas et al. , 2013 ) .
while some components of the translational apparatus can be found ( lin et al. , 2009 ) they are likely not sufficient for translation and may be remnants of earlier developmental stages .
hence , it is believed , that proteins , rna , and many other molecules found in the sieve elements are synthesized in the companion cell and move to the sieve elements via plasmodesmata , possibly in an er - mediated mechanism ( lucas et al. , 2013 ) .
the gdsl - lipase and plafp contain signal peptides , while pig - p is predicted to be a soluble protein .
to understand their localization within the plant cell we generated fusion proteins containing c - terminal fluorescent tags and transiently expressed those in tobacco ( figure 2 ) .
all three proteins are localized in a dispersed pattern at the periphery of the cell .
no co - localization with chloroplasts or nuclei was observed .
similarly , markers for golgi and plasma membrane also show no overlap ( not shown ) .
overlays with a fluorescent marker for the er show that there is little co - localization with the er marker ( figure 2 ) .
this is particularly obvious for gdsl - lipase and plafp where cytoplasmic strands containing the er are clearly visible but show no overlap with the fluorescently tagged protein .
plafp in particular displays a spotted pattern without er - colocalization .
a similar spotted pattern has been reported for receptors as well as for plasmodesmata - mobile proteins ( kim et al. , 2002 ; robatzek et al. , 2006 ) .
figure 2 localization of gdsl - lipase ( a ) , plafp ( b ) , and the pig - p like protein ( c ) using c - terminal fluorescent tags and transient expression in tobacco .
localization of the fusion proteins was determined using confocal microscopy .
chlorophyll fluorescence and a fluorescent er marker were used as controls .
the size marker indicates 20 mum .
to determine the localization of gene expression we searched several phloem - specific transcriptomes ( zhao et al. , 2005 ; deeken et al. , 2008 ; mustroph et al. , 2009 ) for the presence of gdsl - lipase , plafp , and pig - p gene expression .
gdsl - lipase and plafp were found in the companion - cell specific databases suggesting that genes are expressed in the companion cells and could , thus , translocate into the sieve elements via plasmodesmata .
using a gus reporter gene under the control of the plafp promoter we show that plafp - promoter activity is indeed associated with the vasculature in roots and expanding leaves , as well as in the hydathodes , which are associated with the vasculature ( figure 3 : leaf and root ) .
expression at the branch - point for lateral roots and in the leaf primordia suggests that plafp may be necessary during early vasculature development .
figure 3 promoter activity via gus reporter .
two - week old arabidopsis seedlings containing the 1 kb region upstream of the transcription initiation site of plafp were generated .
gene expression was visualized using a gus - reporter staining .
plafp was identified within the leaf vasculature ( a ) as well as the vasculature of root ( b ) of 3 week - old seedlings .
overall gene expression as determined by rt - pcr showed that all three genes are expressed in all tissues of the plant ( stem , root , leaf , and flower ) with gdsl - lipase and plafp expression at slightly reduced levels in the root ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
plafp and gdsl - lipase gene expression is affected by the same environmental factors that lead to the production of their lipid - ligand phosphatidic acid we have shown that gdsl - lipase , plafp , and the pig - p - like protein bind ptdoh , which we had detected in phloem exudates ( guelette et al. , 2012 ) .
ptdoh is a well - known intracellular signal acting in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses such as pathogen response and infection , drought , salinity , wounding , cold , cell death , and oxylipin production ( wang et al. , 2007 , 2014 ; munnik and testerink , 2009 ; xue et al. , 2009 ; hong et al. , 2010 ; testerink and munnik , 2011 ; kim et al. , 2013 ; julkowska et al. , 2015 ) .
it plays a role in maintaining root system architecture as well as salt tolerance ( mcloughlin and testerink , 2013 ) .
in addition , ptdoh is widely known for its role in stomatal closure via the activation of the aba - signaling pathway under drought / osmotic conditions ( guo et al. , 2012 ; lu et al. , 2013 ; yao et al. , 2013 ) .
to understand if gdsl - lipase , plafp , and the pig - p - like protein are controlled by the same environmental factors as ptdoh , we exposed 3 - week - old arabidopsis seedlings to salt ( nacl ) and osmotic stress ( mannitol ) as well as to the drought mimic peg and the stress signal aba ( figure 4 ; supplementary figure 2 ) .
concentrations of mannitol , nacl , peg , and aba were based on those used in the literature ( yamaguchi - shinozaki and shinozaki , 1994 ; nakashima et al. , 1997 ; zhu , 2002 ; fujita et al. , 2005 ; zhu et al. , 2010 ) .
gene expression was monitored for 24 h. pig - p expression was not affected by any of the stress factors ( figure 4 ) .
this is not surprising since we had proposed that pig - p may be part of a receptor and as such , should be constitutively expressed .
gdsl - lipase expression was downregulated by osmotic ( mannitol ) stress , the signaling molecule aba , and water stress as mimicked by peg .
this downregulation was significant within 5 h of treatment and was maintained for 24 h ( figure 4 ) .
plafp displayed the opposite response to these stresses : its expression was strongly upregulated by aba and water stress ( peg ) within 2 h , an effect that was maintained for the entire 24 - h treatment period ( figure 4 ) .
a response to mannitol was observed after 12 - 24 h. this increase in plafp parallels the induction of ptdoh synthesis under the same conditions ( wang et al. , 2007 , 2014 ; munnik and testerink , 2009 ; xue et al. , 2009 ; hong et al. , 2010 ; testerink and munnik , 2011 ; kim et al. , 2013 ; lu et al. , 2013 ; mcloughlin and testerink , 2013 ; yao et al. , 2013 ; julkowska et al. , 2015 ) .
figure 4 effect of abiotic stress on gdsl , plafp , and pig - p expression .
two week old arabidopsis seedlings were submitted to osmotic ( 300 mm mannitol ) and salt ( 150 mm nacl ) stress , a water stress mimic ( 30 % peg 6000 ) , and aba ( 100 mum ) .
values represent mean and standard error of 3 - 6 biological replicates as determined using qpcr ( three technical replicates per biological replicate ) .
the asterisks indicate significance of p < 0.01 ( student 's t - test ) .
discussion a survey of our proteomics analysis of the phloem exudates of arabidopsis thaliana as well as publications of other phloem proteomes has shown the presence of lipids and lipid - binding proteins within the translocation stream ( table 1 ; guelette et al. , 2012 ) .
this prompted us to propose the possibility of long - distance lipid signaling ( benning et al. , 2012 ) .
as part of this long - distance path , one protein would release the lipid into the sieve element ( gdsl - lipase ) where it is bound by a second protein that functions either as transporter or co - signal ( plafp ) and later perceived at a receptor ( pig - p ) .
to participate in the proposed long - distance lipid signaling , these proteins need to fulfill several requirements : they need to bind a specific lipid .
both protein and lipid - ligand need to be present in the phloem sap .
their genes need to be active in the vasculature , specifically in the companion cells .
the protein needs to be capable of moving through plasmodesmata into the sieve element .
the expression of the gene encoding the lipid - binding protein likely is controlled by the same factors as the production of the lipid - ligand .
our results show that all three predicted lipid - binding proteins ( gdsl - lipase , plafp , and the pig - p - like protein ) bind lipids ( figure 1 ) .
most importantly , all three proteins bind ptdoh .
this is of particular importance since ptdoh has been found in the same phloem exudates that were used to identify the protein ( guelette et al. , 2012 ) .
ptdoh is an important intermediate in lipid biosynthesis , a membrane component , and a signaling molecule : as a membrane component it may affect the membrane curvature and , consequently , regulates trafficking and membrane biogenesis ( wang , 2004 ; kooijman et al. , 2005 ) .
most importantly in the context of this work , ptdoh participates in signaling pathways , often by tethering components of these pathways to the membrane , thus , altering their location and function .
ptdoh is rapidly and transiently produced in response to several biotic and abiotic stresses , such as drought , salinity , wounding , cold , pathogen infection , and oxylipin production ( wang et al. , 2007 , 2014 ; munnik and testerink , 2009 ; xue et al. , 2009 ; hong et al. , 2010 ; testerink and munnik , 2011 ; kim et al. , 2013 ; julkowska et al. , 2015 ) .
the path of its production and the enzymes involved varies depending on the environmental signal ( welti et al. , 2002 ; uraji et al. , 2012 ; arisz et al. , 2013 ; mcloughlin and testerink , 2013 ; gonorazky et al. , 2014 ; julkowska et al. , 2015 ) .
we examined if the three ptdoh - binding proteins responded to some of the same environmental factors that induce the production of ptdoh ( figure 4 ) , namely osmotic stress , a water - stress mimic ( peg ) , and the signaling molecule ( aba ) .
pig - p expression is not influenced by any of those factors .
possible explanations are that pig - p is part of a receptor and , hence , would likely be constitutively expressed .
alternatively , it could be post - translationally modified or its function could be unrelated to abiotic stress .
the expression of gdsl - lipase is downregulated by aba , mannitol , and peg and upregulated by nacl .
while there have been other gdsl - lipases that exhibit an increase in expression under various abiotic stresses such as aba , drought , osmotic , salt , and sa stress ( hong et al. , 2008 ) , this particular lipase shows the opposite effect .
the most interesting finding was that plafp expression is upregulated by peg and aba within 5 h and by mannitol within 12 h ( figure 4 ) .
drought , osmotic stress , aba , salt stress and cold activate distinct phospholipases that cleave phospholipids and generate lipid messengers particularly ptdoh , diacylglycerol , and inositol - 3 - phosphate .
they are thought to affect stress tolerance partially through modulating the expression of stress - responsive genes ( zhu , 2002 ) .
one example of a ptdoh - based signaling cascade is the response to osmotic stress and drought , which can lead to an increase in aba .
this increase in aba leads to the activation of phospholipase dalpha1 , which in turn produces ptdoh .
ptdoh prevents abscisic acid insensitive 1 ( abi1 ) , a protein phosphatase 2c , from binding to the aba receptor by tethering it to the membrane , subsequently leading to a modification in gene expression and an aba response .
in addition , ptdoh has been shown to be involved in the intracellular signaling process by regulating stomatal closure , which leads to a conservation of water when the plant is experiencing water - deficit conditions ( lu et al. , 2013 ) , and by regulating the transcription of genes such as glabra2 ( gl2 ) through interaction with the myb transcription factor , werewolf ( yao et al. , 2013 ) .
the proposed function here is that ptdoh tethers werewolf to the nuclear envelope and facilitates its movement into the nucleus .
in long - distance signaling , ptdoh could either act by binding and moving signals from the companion cell into the sieve element , by tethering a receptor to the plasma membrane of the sieve element , by functioning as binding site for a ( proteinaceous ) signal , or by being part of a mobile signal that would consist of a mobile protein with a hydrophobic pocket for lipid ( ptdoh ) binding .
in summary , we find that all three lipid - binding proteins and their lipid ligand ptdoh are present in phloem exudates .
gdsl - lipase and plafp respond to several abiotic stress factors which also regulate ptdoh - production albeit in opposite fashion .
this suggests that these proteins may have a long - distance function in response to abiotic stress .
the facts that both , plafp and its ligand ptdoh are induced by the same environmental factors , that they are both present in the phloem , and that plafp is produced in the vasculature ( figure 3 ) allow for the possibility that they act in the same signaling pathway and may be part of a mobile signal .
thus , plafp - ptdoh can function as model system to study the possibility and mechanisms of lipid - mediated , long - distance signaling in plants .
in addition , they provide a unique opportunity as targets for generating stress tolerant plants .

myocardial ischemia is a major cause of death and remains a disease with extremely deficient clinical therapies and a major problem worldwide .
cold inducible rna - binding protein ( cirbp ) is reported to be involved in multiple pathological processes , including myocardial ischemia .
however , the molecular mechanisms of myocardial ischemia remain elusive .
here , we first overexpressed cirbp by transfection of pc - cirbp ( pcdna3.1 containing coding sequenced for cirbp ) and silenced cirbp by transfection of small interfering rna targeting cirbp ( sicirbp ) .
pcdna3.1 and the negative control of sicirbp ( sinc ) were transfected into h9c2 cells to act as controls .
we then constructed a cell model of myocardial ischemia through culturing cells in serum - free medium with hypoxia in h9c2 cells .
subsequently , alamarblue assay , flow cytometry and western blot analysis were used , respectively , to assess cell viability , reactive oxygen species ( ros ) level and apoptosis , and expression levels of ikappabalpha , p65 and bcl - 3 .
we demonstrated that cirbp overexpression promoted cell proliferation ( p < 0.001 ) , inhibited cell apoptosis ( p < 0.05 ) , reduced ros level ( p < 0.001 ) , down - regulated phosphorylated levels of ikappabalpha and p65 ( p < 0.01 or p < 0.001 ) , and up - regulated expression of bcl - 3 ( p < 0.001 ) in h9c2 cells with myocardial ischemia .
the influence of cirbp knockdown yielded opposite results .
our study revealed that cirbp could protect h9c2 cells against myocardial ischemia through inhibition of nf - kappab pathway .
myocardial ischemia cirbp nf - kappab cell proliferation cell apoptosis introduction myocardial ischemia is a major cause of death , leading to a disease for which clinical therapy is extremely deficient worldwide ( 1 ) .
myocardial ischemia refers to the reduction of blood perfusion in the heart , resulting in reduction of heart oxygenation and abnormal myocardial energy metabolism , so that the normal functioning of the heart cannot be well supported ( 2,3 ) .
essential to myocardial cell activity , oxygen is transported to cells through blood .
the hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning has been proven to be an effective prevention against myocardial infarction ( 4 ) .
the heart relies solely on the myocardial blood supply , so that myocardial ischemia can immediately affect heart function ( 5 - 7 ) .
myocardial ischemia and its related mechanisms , as well as the determinants for this disease , have been partly studied ( 8,9 ) .
zhang et al .
( 9 ) explored the effect of hydrogen sulfide on myocardial ischemia / reperfusion injury ( miri ) and found that hydrogen sulfide could protect against miri in mice , and this might be related to the enhancement of antioxidative ability and the decreased release of inflammatory factors .
although great progress has been made in mechanism and therapy research , the biological basis for the increased rate of myocardial ischemia also needs to be deeply understood .
cold - inducible rna - binding protein ( cirbp ) is a stress response protein found in mammals , which is excessively expressed under cold stress , hypoxia stress , ultraviolet irradiation , etc .
( 10 - 13 ) .
studies have shown that cirbp is expressed in various cell types and is involved in various disease processes , such as cancer , wound healing , sepsis , and others ( 14 - 16 ) .
cirbp is constitutively expressed at low levels across several tissues , but the role of cirbp in myocardial cell hypoxia stress reaction and its underlying mechanism remain deficient .
in this study , we investigated cell viability , apoptosis , and reactive oxygen species ( ros ) of h9c2 cells in vitro , and confirmed the connection between cirbp and myocardial ischemia injury .
the involved pathway of cirbp in myocardial ischemia injury was also investigated .
the present study provided a new understanding of the regulation of cirbp in myocardial ischemia injury and identified potential avenues for therapeutic intervention of this disease .

for hypoxia treatment , the medium was replaced by serum - free dmem when the cells reached 80 % confluence .
then , cells were incubated in anaerobe gas generating pouch system ( gaspak ( tm ) ez , bd biosciences , usa ) with 10 % co2 and 1 % o2 following the manufacturer 's instructions .
plasmids and sirna transfection the full - length coding sequence of wild - type cirbp was sub - cloned into pcdna3.1 ( invitrogen , usa ) to construct pcdna3.1 / cirbp ( pc - cirbp ) which was confirmed by sequencing .

briefly , cells ( 104 cells / well ) were seeded onto 96 - well plates and cultured under hypoxia for 4 days .
cell viability was assessed daily by replacing the medium with dmem supplemented with 10 % alamarblue , followed by incubation for 3 h at 37degreesc .
thereafter , absorbance was measured at 570 nm ( 600 nm background subtraction ) with a microplate reader ( bio - rad , usa ) .
ros assay we measured the ros levels by flow cytometry using 2,7 - dichlorofluorescein diacetate ( dcfh - da ) ( jiancheng bioengineering institute , china ) .
the cells were cultured in a 6 - well plate .
after rinsing with phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) twice , cells were co - incubated with serum - free dmem medium containing 10 mum dcfh - da for 20 min at 37degreesc in dark .
then , samples were collected by trypsin digestion method .
all samples were centrifuged at 150 g for 5 min at 4degreesc and the supernatants were removed .
the cells were resuspended to 500 mul pbs and the fluorescence intensities were measured by using a flow cytometer ( 488 nm excitation , 521 nm emissions ) .
apoptosis assay apoptosis assay was performed by using annexin v - fitc / pi apoptosis detection kit ( beijing biosea biotechnology , china ) .
the adherent and floating cells were combined and washed by pre - cold pbs .
then , cells were resuspended by binding buffer and stained by 10 mul annexin v - fitc and 5 mul pi in turn , according to the manufacturer 's instruction .
after that , cells were measured with flow cytometer ( beckman coulter , usa ) to differentiate apoptotic cells ( annexin - v positive and pi - negative ) from necrotic cells ( annexin - v and pi - positive ) .
quantitative reverse transcription pcr ( qrt - pcr ) total rna was isolated from transfected cells by using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , usa ) and dnasei ( promega , usa ) .
reverse transcription was performed by using the multiscribe reverse transcriptase and a mix of random hexamers and oligo dt ( all from applied biosystems , usa ) at a condition of 10 min at 25degreesc , 30 min at 48degreesc and a final step of 5 min at 95degreesc ( 17 ) .
cdna was then subjected to amplification by using sybr green pcr master mix ( applied biosystem ) according to manufacturer 's instructions .
relative mrna expression levels were calculated using the formula 2 - deltadeltact ( 18 ) .
the primers were synthesized as shown in table 1 ( sangon , china ) .
napdh was used as the housekeeping gene .
table 1 primer sequences .
western blot analysis the protein used for western blotting was extracted using ripa lysis buffer ( beyotime biotechnology , china ) supplemented with protease inhibitors ( roche , china ) and quantified using the bca ( tm ) protein assay kit ( pierce , usa ) .
the western blot system was established using a bio - rad bis - tris gel system according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the proteins were separated by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane .
primary antibodies against cirbp ( ab106239 ) , bcl - 3 ( ab27780 ) , ( both from abcam , uk ) ; inhibitor of nuclear factor kappabalpha ( ikappabalpha , 4812 ) , phosphorylated ikappabalpha ( p - ikappabalpha , 5209 ) , p65 ( 8242 ) , phosphorylated p65 ( p - p65 , 3031 ) , ( all from cell signaling technology , usa ) and gapdh ( g9545 , sigma , usa ) were diluted and incubated with the membrane at 4degreesc overnight , followed by wash and incubation with secondary antibodies marked by horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) for 1 h at room temperature .
after rinsing , the membranes with blots and antibodies were transferred into the bio - rad chemidoc ( tm ) xrs system , followed by addition of 200 mul immobilon western chemiluminescent hrp substrate ( millipore , usa ) to cover the membrane surface .
the signals were captured and the intensity of the bands was quantified using image lab ( tm ) software ( bio - rad ) .
statistical analysis data are reported as means +/ - sd. statistical analyses were performed using graphpad statistical software ( graphpad , usa ) .
the p values were calculated using one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) .
a p value of < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant result .
results pc - cirbp and sicirbp successfully interfered with the expression of cirbp h9c2 cells were transfected with sicirbp , pc - cirbp and their controls , respectively .
qrt - pcr and western blot analysis displayed the expression levels of cirbp at both mrna and protein levels .
as shown in figure 1a and c , the cirbp expression levels were significantly increased by pc - cirbp when compared to cells transfected with pcdna3.1 ( p < 0.05 ) .
at the same time , the cirbp expression levels were markedly decreased by sicirbp compared with cells transfected with negative control of sicirbp ( sinc ) ( figure 1b and d , p < 0.01 ) .
thus , we concluded that the transfection of pc - cirbp successfully overexpressed cirbp while transfection of sicirbp successfully silenced cirbp .

cirbp promoted cell proliferation to investigate the effects of cirbp on cell proliferation , the alamarblue assay was employed to test the cell viability of myocardial ischemia cells .
in figure 1e , overexpression of cirbp significantly enhanced cell viability at 2 - 4 days compared with its control ( p < 0.001 ) .
meanwhile , cirbp knockdown significantly reduced cell viability at 2 - 4 days compared with its control ( p < 0.001 ) .

cirbp suppressed cell apoptosis to investigate the effects of cirbp on cell apoptosis , flow cytometry was employed to assess cell apoptosis of myocardial ischemia cells .
the results in figure 2 showed that overexpression of cirbp inhibited cell apoptosis compared with its control ( p < 0.05 ) , while cirbp knockdown promoted cell apoptosis compared with its control ( p < 0.05 ) .
thus , we concluded that cirbp could inhibit cell apoptosis in myocardial ischemia cells .

cirbp reduced ros levels we measured ros levels by flow cytometry .
the ros levels in figure 3 clearly showed that overexpression of cirbp significantly reduced ros levels compared with its control ( p < 0.001 ) , while knockdown of cirbp enhanced ros levels significantly compared with its control ( p < 0.05 ) .
therefore , cirbp could obviously reduce ros levels .

* p < 0.05 , sicirbp compared to sinc ; *** p < 0.001 , pc - cirpb compared to pcdna3.1 ( anova ) .
effect of cirbp on myocardial ischemia was related to nf - kappab pathway based on the above results , we focused on the nuclear factor - kappab ( nf - kappab ) pathway .
as shown in figure 4 , phosphorylated levels of ikappabalpha and p65 were markedly down - regulated ( p < 0.01 or p < 0.001 ) but expression level of bcl - 3 was up - regulated by cirbp overexpression compared to their controls .
meanwhile , the influence of cirbp knockdown was opposite to ciprb overexpression , resulting in up - regulation of ikappabalpha and p65 phosphorylation and down - regulation of bcl - 3 expression ( p < 0.05 or p < 0.001 ) .
thus , the effects of cirbp on myocardial ischemia could be connected with the nf - kappab pathway activation .

discussion myocardial ischemia remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite of significant progress in cardiovascular medicine ( 19 ) .
results suggest that many factors influence the progress and development of myocardial ischemia ( 20,21 ) .
cirbp , which is the first cold - shock protein identified in mammals , was recently identified as a proinflammatory cytokine ( 22 ) .
as a sensor protein , which expression increases in response to stress , cirbp plays important roles in tumor recurrence ( 23,24 ) .
a study by zhang et al .
( 25 ) has shown that cirbp plays key roles in hypoxia - induced cell cycle arrest and may be utilized for preventing hypoxia - induced neonatal brain injury .
therefore , in our study , we focused on cirbp and explored its role in transfected h9c2 cells .
myocardial ischemia is a process that causes reduced blood supply to the heart , resulting in simultaneous nutrient and oxygen deprivation ( 26 ) .
a vast number of studies used h9c2 cells to simulate myocardial ischemia for addressing miri ( 27,28 ) .
the results implied that cell proliferation was promoted by cirbp overexpression but suppressed by cirbp knockdown .
at the same time , the effect of cirbp on cell apoptosis was opposite to proliferation .
the results in our study are in agreement with previous investigations .
jian et al. suggested that cirbp up - regulation could induce corticotroph cell proliferation in pituitary corticotroph adenoma ( 29 ) .
li et al .
( 30 ) has demonstrated that cirbp inhibited h2o2 - induced apoptosis in rat cortical neurons .
however , another study interestingly found that cirbp significantly activated inflammasome and thereby induced cell death of mouse lung vascular endothelial cell ( 11 ) .
thus , we suspected that the specific influence of cirbp on cell proliferation and apoptosis varied depending on cell types .
our study was the first to explore the role of cirbp in myocardial cells .
studies on cirbp as a therapeutic drug should continue to support the application of cirbp on clinical therapy of myocardial ischemia .
studies have reported that starvation and hypoxia frequently trigger production of ros , which is shown to largely damage cardiomyocyte ( 31,32 ) .
massive ros production causes cell death due to necrosis .
in the present study , the ros level in cells with myocardial ischemia was significantly reduced by cirbp overexpression while markedly enhanced by cirbp knockdown .
the alteration of ros levels could partially explain the effect of cirbp on cell proliferation and apoptosis .
overproduction of ros leads to oxidative stress , and nf - kappab is an essential transcription factor , which could be activated by oxidative stress and effectively regulate cell apoptosis ( 33 ) .
thus , we speculated that the influence of cirbp on cell proliferation and apoptosis might be associated with nf - kappab signaling pathway .
ikappabalpha , an effective inhibitor of nf - kappab , is located in the cytoplasm and binds to nf - kappab ( p50 - p65 heterodimer ) in the unstimulated cells ( 34 ) .
under oxidative stress , the ikappabalpha could be phosphorylated , ubiquitinated and degraded , followed by phosphorylation of p65 ( 35 ) .
the phosphorylated p65 then translocates to the nucleus and binds to a specific sequence , resulting in gene transcription including pro - apoptotic genes ( 36 ) .
in our study , the phosphorylated levels of ikappabalpha and p65 were both down - regulated by cirbp overexpression , which might lead to repression of cell apoptosis .
in terms of bcl - 3 , accumulating experiments demonstrate its role as proliferative factor ( 37 ) .
on the one hand , bcl - 3 could bind to nf - kappab ( p50 - p52 heterodimer ) and then activate cyclin - d1 promoter , resulting in increased cell proliferation ( 38 ) .
on the other hand , bcl - 3 is implied to block apoptosis in il - 4 - deprived cells ( 39 ) .
in our study , the expression level of bcl - 3 was markedly up - regulated by cirbp overexpression , which might be another explanation for the effect of cirbp on proliferation and apoptosis of h9c2 cells with myocardial ischemia .
our study found that overexpression of cirbp promoted cell proliferation and suppressed cell apoptosis via the nf - kappab signaling pathway .
this paper preliminarily studied the role of cirbp in myocardial ischemia injury as well as the underling mechanism , which might provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of myocardial ischemia injury .

ethylene is a simple two carbon atom molecule with profound effects on plants .
there are quite a few review papers covering all aspects of ethylene biology in plants , including its biosynthesis , signaling and physiology .
this is merely a logical consequence of the fascinating and pleiotropic nature of this gaseous plant hormone .
its biochemical precursor , 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylic acid ( acc ) is also a fairly simple molecule , but perhaps its role in plant biology is seriously underestimated .
this triangularly shaped amino acid has many more features than just being the precursor of the lead - role player ethylene .
for example , acc can be conjugated to three different derivatives , but their biological role remains vague .
acc can also be metabolized by bacteria using acc - deaminase , favoring plant growth and lowering stress susceptibility .
acc is also subjected to a sophisticated transport mechanism to ensure local and long - distance ethylene responses .
last but not least , there are now a few exciting studies where acc has been reported to function as a signal itself , independently from ethylene .
this review puts acc in the spotlight , not to give it the lead - role , but to create a picture of the stunning co - production of the hormone and its precursor .
1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylic acid ( acc ) ethylene conjugation deaminase transport signaling the discovery of acc the discovery of ethylene as a plant growth regulator can be attributed to the work of the russian scientist neljubov ( 1901 ) .
he reported that dark - grown pea seedlings showed a reduced hypocotyl growth in combination with an exaggerated hypocotyl bending when exposed to illumination gas ( neljubov , 1901 ) .
neljubov ( 1901 ) could pinpoint ethylene gas as the active component that caused dark - grown pea seedlings to bend , by flowing the illumination gas over several filters prior to exposing the seedlings .
this typical ethylene response of dark - grown seedlings was later defined as the triple response : ( 1 ) shortening of the hypocotyl and roots , ( 2 ) radial swelling of the hypocotyl , and ( 3 ) the exaggeration of the apical hook ( knight et al. , 1910 ) .
in 1934 , conclusive evidence that ethylene is a natural product from plants , was presented by the english scientist ( gane , 1934 ) .
it took another 30 years before the primary steps of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway were elucidated ( see figure 1 ) .
lieberman and mapson ( 1964 ) first reported that ethylene could be produced from the amino acid methionine , taking advantage of the high rates of ethylene production from apples for their experimental work ( figure 1 ) .
13 years later , adams and yang ( 1977 ) made tremendous progress in understanding the biosynthesis pathway of ethylene , when they discovered that s - adenosyl - l - methionine ( sam ) was an intermediate between methionine and ethylene .
yang and co - workers also showed that 5 ' - methylthioadenosine ( mta ) was formed as a by - product from sam and that mta could be recycled back to methionine ( murr and yang , 1975 ) .
the elaboration of the different reaction steps of the methionine cycle in plants , now often referred to as the yang - cycle , was mainly inspired by the biochemical similarities between the plant pathway and the methionine salvage cycle which was already known for prokaryotes , yeast , and mammalians .
an - up - to - date overview of the methionine and sam metabolism in plants is given by sauter et al .
( 2013 ) .
the major discovery that made the methionine cycle in plants unique from all other organisms , was the characterization of 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylic acid ( acc ) as the intermediate between sam and ethylene ( adams and yang , 1979 ) .
adams and yang ( 1979 ) were able to identify acc as the precursor for ethylene by feeding experiments on apple tissue , using radio - labeled methionine .
upon incubation of apple disks , they observed a shift from ethylene production in air , toward an unknown compound that was retained in the tissue when treated with nitrogen ( lack of oxygen inhibits oxidation of acc toward ethylene ). by using a ph - dependent ion mobility assay , they could characterize this unknown component as an amino acid .
subsequently , the component was identified as acc , using co - migration of synthetic acc for both paper - chromatography and paper - electrophoresis ( adams and yang , 1979 ) .
they further showed that the conversion of radioactively labeled methionine toward ethylene decreased when unlabeled acc was supplemented , yet the conversion of labeled acc to ethylene was almost not affected when unlabeled methionine was supplemented , suggesting that externally supplied acc is in fact used to produce ethylene .
additional evidence for acc being the intermediate precursor between sam and ethylene was obtained by treating apple tissue with [ s ] - trans - 2 - amino - 4 ( 2 ' - aminoethoxy ) trans - 3 - butenoic acid , also known as avg ( 2 - amino - ethoxy - vinylglycine ) , a pyridoxal - 5 ' - phosphate ( plp or vitamin b6 ) dependent enzyme inhibitor , which was later known to inhibit the enzymatic conversion of sam toward acc .
the identification of acc as the precursor of ethylene was a major breakthrough in the understanding of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway in plants , and was part of the foundation for many new discoveries in the field of ethylene biology .

the amino acid methionine is converted to s - adenosyl - l - methionine ( sam ) by sam - synthetase ( sams ) with the requirement of atp .
the general precursor sam is then converted to acc by acc - synthase ( acs ) .
this reaction also involves the cleavage of 5 ' - methylthioadenosine ( mta ) , which is recycled back to methionine by the yang cycle ( dotted line indicates multiple enzymatic steps ) .
acc can be converted to ethylene by acc - oxidase ( aco ) in the presence of oxygen .
acc can also be converted to its major conjugate 1 - malonyl - acc ( macc ) by the yet uncharacterized acc - n - malonyl transferase ( amt ) with the requirement of malonyl - coenzyme - a. a second derivate of acc is gamma - glutamyl - acc ( gacc ) which is formed by gamma - glutamyl - transpeptidase ( ggt ) with the requirement of glutathione ( gsh ) .
another novel derivate of acc is jasmonyl - acc ( ja - acc ) , which is formed by jasmonic acid resistance 1 ( jar1 ) .
acc can also be metabolized by the bacterial ( and plant ) acc deaminase into ammonium and alpha - ketobutyrate .
acc and ethylene biosynthesis as mentioned above , acc is produced from sam , releasing mta .
this reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme acc - synthase ( acs ; boller et al. , 1979 ) .
acs is a member of the plp - dependent enzymes , which use vitamin b6 as a co - factor for its enzymatic function .
acs was localized in the cytosol by activity assays on extracts retrieved after differential centrifugation ( boller et al. , 1979 ) .
acs genes were first characterized in zucchini by sato and theologis ( 1989 ) and in tomato by van der straeten et al .
( 1990 ) .
acs is encoded by a multigene family of 12 members in arabidopsis , eight of which encode functional acc synthases [ acs2 ( named acs1 in van der straeten et al. , 1992 ) , acs4 - 9 , acs11 ] .
in addition , there is one inactive isoform ( atacs1 ) and one pseudogene ( atacs3 ; yamagami et al. , 2003 ) .
acs was found to form functional dimers of which the 3d structure was determined by capitani et al .
( 1999 ) .
the formation of heterodimers increases the structural and functional complexity of the acs protein family ( tsuchisaka et al. , 2009 ) .
the large acs gene family displays a tissue - specific and differential expression pattern in arabidopsis ( tsuchisaka and theologis , 2004 ) .
using single and multiple acs knock - out mutants , it was demonstrated that there are specific developmental and physiological roles for individual members of the acs gene - family , but also that there is a complex combinatorial interplay amongst them ( tsuchisaka et al. , 2009 ) .
a diverse group of internal and external signals modulate the level of ethylene biosynthesis in numerous plant species , acting at the level of acs gene expression .
these inducers include auxin , cytokinin , brassinosteroids , ethylene , copper , mechano - stimuli , ozone , pathogens and wounding ( van der straeten et al. , 1992 ; rodrigues - pousada et al. , 1993 ; botella et al. , 1995 ; cary et al. , 1995 ; liang et al. , 1996 ; vahala et al. , 1998 ; woeste et al. , 1999 ) .
three types of acs proteins are recognized , based on their c - terminal structure .
type i acs proteins contain in their c - terminal domain one putative calcium - dependent protein kinase ( cdpk ) phosphorylation target site and three mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) phosphorylation sites ( yoon and kieber , 2013 ) .
type ii acs proteins only contain the mapk phosphorylation sites , while type iii acs do not contain any phosphorylation sites ( yoon and kieber , 2013 ) .
these post - translational phosphorylation sites play an important role in the stability of the acs protein ( chae and kieber , 2005 ) .
both in arabidopsis ( chae et al. , 2003 ; kim et al. , 2003 ; liu and zhang , 2004 ; wang et al. , 2004 ; yoshida et al. , 2005 , 2006 ; joo et al. , 2008 ; christians et al. , 2009 ; lyzenga et al. , 2012 ) and in tomato ( tatsuki and mori , 2001 ; kamiyoshihara et al. , 2010 ) it was shown that differential phosphorylation of certain acs members directed the protein for proteasomal degradation .
protein stability of certain acs members is further regulated by the protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ; skottke et al. , 2011 ) and pp2c ( ludwikow et al. , 2014 ) , demonstrating a complex balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation to secure protein activity and stability .
the second ethylene biosynthesis protein is acc - oxidase ( aco ) , which converts acc to ethylene in the presence of oxygen .
it took a long time before aco activity could be demonstrated in vitro .
the key aspect in isolating aco was the addition of ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) to the extraction media , as was first reported by ververidis and john ( 1991 ) who isolated aco from melon tissue and quantified in vitro aco activity .
although the exact role of ascorbic acid for protein stability / activity remained uncertain for a long time ( rocklin et al. , 2004 ) , it was recently clarified that ascorbic acid participates in the ring opening of acc , by providing a single - electron to the active site ( murphy et al. , 2014 ) .
this catalytic reaction releases ethylene and a cyanoformate ion [ ncco2 ] - , which is subsequently decomposed into co2 and cn - ( murphy et al. , 2014 ) .
the reactive cyanide ( cn - ) is subsequently detoxified by beta - cyanoalanine synthase to produce beta - cyanoalanine ( miller and conn , 1980 ) .
aco belongs to the superfamily of dioxygenases that require iron ( fe2 +) as co - factor and bicarbonate as activator ( dong et al. , 1992 ; zhang et al. , 2004 ) .
the subcellular localization of aco remains vague , as some studies localize aco in the cytosol ( reinhardt et al. , 1994 ; chung et al. , 2002 ; hudgins et al. , 2006 ) , while other localize aco at the plasma membrane ( rombaldi et al. , 1994 ; ramassamy et al. , 1998 ) .
although the aco protein sequence does not contain any predicted transmembrane domains , it is still possible that the protein associates with the plasma membrane via ( in ) direct interactions .
aco is also encoded by a multigene family of five members in arabidopsis [ aco1 , 2 , 4 , at1g12010 ( aoc3 ) and at1g77330 ( aco5 )] .
expression of different members of the tomato aco family in escherichia coli showed that each isoform had a specific in vitro enzyme activity ( bidonde et al. , 1998 ) .
it is well accepted that acs is the rate limiting step of ethylene biosynthesis in plants ( yang and hoffman , 1984 ) although there are examples where aco is the rate limiting step , e.g. , during post - climacteric ripening of tomato fruit ( van de poel et al. , 2012 ) .
three aco genes are also auto - regulated by ethylene in arabidopsis ( de paepe et al. , 2004 ) .
this might suggest that the regulation of aco expression and / or activity is more complex than anticipated .
there are some hints for a putative post - transcriptional and / or post - translational regulatory mechanisms of aco as suggested by dilley et al .
( 2013 ) and as investigated through mathematical modeling by van de poel et al .
( 2014a ) .
both acs and aco are two well - studied enzymes that exclusively participate in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway .
both proteins are well characterized , but many more questions remain unanswered .
while the post - translational regulation of acs has been revealed , the biochemical and mechanistic details of this protein modification are still unclear .
transcriptional and functional characterization of the different acs gene - family members has shone light on the combinatorial interplay , nevertheless , much more work is needed to elucidate the exact role of each isoform and how they interact with each other .
much less is known about the post - translational regulation and combinatorial interplay of aco .
a lack of genetic studies focusing on aco , raises the question whether or not aco shares a similar structural , biochemical and post - translational complexity as acs .
acc as a pivotal molecule : acc conjugates and the control of ethylene biosynthesis 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylic acid is best known as the direct precursor of ethylene in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway .
however , there also exist three different conjugates of acc , suggesting that the biochemical regulation of the available acc pool is more complex than anticipated , which in turn can possibly affect the eventual levels of the plant hormone ethylene .
shortly after the identification of acc as the intermediate between sam and ethylene in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway , a first conjugated form of acc , called malonyl - acc ( macc ) , was discovered by amrhein et al .
( 1981 ) in buckwheat seedlings and by hoffman et al .
( 1982 ) in wheat leaves .
macc is formed by acc - n - malonyl transferase ( amt ) which was purified from tomato extracts ( martin and saftner , 1995 ) , although not structurally characterized .
it was shown that the conjugation of acc into macc was stimulated by ethylene in preclimacteric tomatoes ( liu et al. , 1985a ) , grapefruit flavedo ( outer peel ; liu et al. , 1985b ) and tobacco leaves ( philosoph - hadas et al. , 1985 ) , indicative for a feedback control of ethylene biosynthesis .
martin and saftner ( 1995 ) also showed that the activity of amt was ethylene inducible and that its activity correlated with the increase in ethylene production during climacteric ripening of tomato ( martin and saftner , 1995 ) .
the exact amino acid and gene sequences of amt are not yet known , and no putative amt gene is annotated in the arabidopsis genome , limiting more in - depth genetic and molecular studies .
because macc does not participate in any other known biological conversions , macc formation might be a mechanism to control the available acc pool .
this hypothesis was further strengthened by the observation that macc could be translocated from the cytosol into the vacuole ( and back ) by atp - dependent tonoplast carriers ( bouzayen et al. , 1988 , 1989 ; tophof et al. , 1989 ) .
nonetheless , the reconversion of macc toward acc by an unknown macc - hydrolase was reported twice in literature ( jiao et al. , 1986 ; hanley et al. , 1989 ) .
the ability to hydrolyze macc back into acc and the ability to ' store ' macc in the vacuole is an interesting mechanism to regulate the cellular availability of macc .
moreover , because macc has no other biochemical role besides being an acc conjugate , the regulation of macc levels can also affect the available pool of acc and possibly ethylene production levels .
this hypothesis was investigated by in silico mathematical modeling , showing that the reconversion of macc to acc could have a potential stimulating effect on ethylene production during climacteric fruit ripening of tomato ( van de poel et al. , 2014a ) .
a second important derivative of acc is gamma - glutamyl - acc ( gacc ) , which was discovered in crude tomato extracts of acc - n - malonyltransferase ( martin et al. , 1995 ) .
these crude protein extracts were able to form a new acc derivative , which could be identified as gacc ( martin et al. , 1995 ) .
gacc is formed by the reaction of acc with the tripeptide glutathione ( gsh ) by a gamma - glutamyl - transpeptidase ( also called gamma - glutamyl - transferase , ggt ; martin et al. , 1995 ; martin and slovin , 2000 ) .
while a first report , based on in vitro studies , stated that gacc was the most abundant acc derivative in tomato ( martin and saftner , 1995 ; martin et al. , 1995 ) , another study found that macc was the most abundant acc derivative in vivo in tomato fruit during climacteric ripening ( peiser and yang , 1998 ) .
the arabidopsis genome contains four genes ( ggt1 - 4 ) , of which only ggt1 and ggt2 are catalytically active ( martin et al. , 2007 ) .
both ggt1 and ggt2 are co - expressed predominantly in rapidly growing tissue , and are localized extracellularly , which raised the question about the role of extracellular gacc ( martin et al. , 2007 ) .
a knock - out mutant of ggt1 shows rapid senescence , while ggt3 knock - outs have a reduced rosette size and silique number ( martin et al. , 2007 ) .
the effect of gacc formation by ggt on acc availability and possibly ethylene biosynthesis remains to be investigated .
a third derivative of acc is jasmonyl - acc ( ja - acc ) .
this molecule was discovered by screening for amino acid conjugates of ja , using gc - ms ( staswick and tiryaki , 2004 ) .
four amino acid conjugates of ja ( ja - ile , ja - val , ja - leu , and ja - phe ) were quantified in arabidopsis tissue ( staswick and tiryaki , 2004 ) .
interestingly , the same authors also demonstrated that ja forms a conjugate with acc ( ja - acc ) in arabidopsis leaves ( staswick and tiryaki , 2004 ) .
recombinant jar1 enzyme was found to be able to form ja - acc in vitro .
strangely , levels of ja - acc were higher in the leaves of jar1 mutants compared to wild - type plants .
it was also shown that ja - acc inhibits root growth in arabidopsis .
elegant genetic experiments with ja signaling mutants ( coi1 - 35 ) showed that the ja - acc - induced root inhibition was independent of ja signaling .
furthermore , the ethylene signaling mutant etr1 - 1 and the double mutant etr1 - 1 jar1 - 1 were insensitive to the ja - acc treatment and displayed no inhibition of root growth , indicating that ja - acc acts via the ethylene signaling pathway ( staswick and tiryaki , 2004 ) .
most likely the acc moiety of ja - acc is responsible for an increase in ethylene production which results in the root growth inhibition response .
these experiments suggest that ja - acc might serve as a pivotal molecule which can function as a modulator of the hormonal cross - talk between the ethylene and jasmonic acid pathway , although the exact molecular and biochemical mechanism of ja - acc function remains unclear .
the three above - mentioned derivatives of acc ( macc , gacc , and ja - acc ) are perhaps not the only ones .
future metabolic studies might reveal additional conjugates of acc .
nonetheless , these three derivatives can potentially play an important role in the regulation of the pool of available acc , which in turn can affect eventual ethylene production levels , with physiological and developmental consequences .
genetic perturbations of the formation of acc derivatives could be a useful tool to unravel their exact roles .
in addition , a more detailed structural and biochemical characterization of the enzymes involved in the formation of acc derivatives is essential .
acc deaminase and plants as mentioned above , plants possess several mechanisms to control their pool of acc , for example by converting it to ethylene or to conjugates like macc , gacc , or ja - acc .
another unique way to metabolize acc , is the deamination of acc .
acc deaminase was first discovered in bacteria .
some plant growth - promoting bacteria are capable of processing the plant - borne acc by converting it into ammonia and alpha - ketobutyrate using the enzyme acc deaminase ( honma and shimomura , 1978 ) .
acc deaminase was retrieved in for example , pseudomonas sp. strain acp ( honma and shimomura , 1978 ) , pseudomonas chloroaphis 6g5 ( klee et al. , 1991 ) , pseudomonas putida gr12 - 2 ( jacobson et al. , 1994 ) and pseudomonas putida uw4 ( hontzeas et al. , 2004 ) .
the bacterial acc deaminase is a plp - dependent enzyme with a rather low affinity for acc ( the reported km value is 1.5 - 15 mm ; glick et al. , 2007 ) .
nonetheless , relatively low concentrations of acc ( 100 nm ) can already induce the expression of the acc deaminase gene ( acds ) , but so do other amino acids like l - alanine , dl - alanine , and dl - valine ( jacobson et al. , 1994 ) .
acds expression is also under the regulation of the nitrogen fixation ( nif ) promotor of some rhizobia , linking acc deaminase with nodule formation ( nukui et al. , 2006 ; nascimento et al. , 2012 ) .
plant growth - promoting bacteria that harbor acc deaminase must interact with the root environment in order to access plant - produced acc .
it was shown that root exudates contain certain amounts of acc , which might attract acc deaminase containing bacteria and establish the rhizosphere interaction ( penrose et al. , 2001 ) .
it has been proposed that bacterial acc deaminase can reduce the endogenous ethylene levels of plant roots by limiting the amount of available acc , which will in turn prevent ethylene - induced root growth inhibition , and thus promote plant growth ( glick et al. , 1998 , 2007 ; glick , 2014 ) .
another model proposes that plant growth - promoting bacteria produce iaa which can be taken up by the plant , and can induce the expression of acs , resulting in an increase in acc production , providing a nitrogen supply for the bacteria ( glick et al. , 1998 , 2007 ; glick , 2014 ) .
there are many beneficial effects of acc deaminase containing bacteria on plant growth , particularly in relation to stress tolerance .
for instance , acc deaminase containing bacteria can reduce stress susceptibility of plants during flooding ( barnawal et al. , 2012 ; li et al. , 2013 ) , drought ( mayak et al. , 2004a ) , salinity ( mayak et al. , 2004b ; nadeem et al. , 2007 , 2010 ) , flower senescence ( nayani et al. , 1998 ; ali et al. , 2012 ) , metal pollution ( glick , 2010 ) , organic pollution ( gurska et al. , 2009 ) and pathogens ( glick , 2014 and references therein ) .
in addition , it has been reported that the presence of acc deaminase can increase the symbiotic performance of rhizobial strains ( ma et al. , 2003 ) .
hence , bacterial acc deaminase is also used as a biotechnological tool to control endogenous acc levels and consequently lower ethylene production in plants .
transgenic plants overexpressing bacterial acc deaminase were shown to be more resistant to growth inhibition when confronted with fungal pathogens ( lund et al. , 1998 ; robison et al. , 2001 ) , salt stress ( sergeeva et al. , 2006 ) , and metals ( grichko et al. , 2000 ; nie et al. , 2002 ) .
plants themselves also contain a homolog of the bacterial acc deaminase .
in arabidopsis , it was demonstrated that the previously known enzyme d - cysteine desulfydrase also possesses acc deaminase activity ( mcdonnell et al. , 2009 ) .
antisense lines showed a decreased acc deaminase activity , an increased sensitivity to acc and produced more ethylene ( mcdonnell et al. , 2009 ) .
these results indicate that the plant - specific acc deaminase might be another metabolic shunt regulating acc levels and ethylene production in plants .
acc transport and its role during root stress besides the biosynthesis , conjugation , and catabolism of a hormone , short or long range transport is another important aspect to regulate proper dosage of a hormonal signal within an organism .
often , hormones are synthesized at one site and transported to another site for their action .
hormonal transport from one cell to another is an advanced process , that facilitates tissue specific or long - distance physiological processes or stress responses .
because ethylene is a gaseous molecule , it can freely diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell , evoking mainly local responses .
the presence of aerenchyma or large intercellular voids facilitates rapid long - distance transport of ethylene gas in plant organs .
but long - distance ethylene responses can also be achieved by transport of its precursor acc .
often , but not always , acc is transported from the roots to the shoot , when the roots are exposed to stress ( mcmanus , 2012 ) .
yet , local acc transport between cells of the same tissue type and intracellular transport is also possible , illustrating the molecular complexity of acc transport .
one of the best characterized acc transport systems is the translocation of acc from the roots to the shoots of tomato plants suffering from flooding or root hypoxia .
a lack of oxygen in the rhizosphere will induce the expression of acs in the roots ( olson et al. , 1995 ; shiu et al. , 1998 ) resulting in an increased acs activity ( bradford et al. , 1982 ; wang and arteca , 1992 ) .
the excess of acc in the roots is not converted to ethylene due to a lack of oxygen and the absence of aco in the roots .
rather , acc is loaded into the xylem and transported to the shoots ( bradford and yang , 1980 ) .
once arrived at the shoots , acc is converted into ethylene by aco , which is already present in the leaves ( english et al. , 1995 ) .
in tomato , root hypoxia will result in an epinastic response of leaves due to an increased ethylene production ( figure 2a ; doubt , 1917 ; jackson and campbell , 1976 ) .
differential expression of both acs and aco during hypoxia was also observed in arabidopsis ( peng et al. , 2005 ) , sunflower seedlings ( finlayson et al. , 1991 ) , maize ( atwell et al. , 2006 ; geisler - lee et al. , 2010 ) , and rice ( zarembinski and theologis , 1993 , 1997 ; van der straeten et al. , 1997 , 2001 ; zhou et al. , 2001 ) .
interestingly , long - distance transport of acc has also been suggested to occur during other root stress conditions as for example drought ( davies et al. , 2000 ; sobeih et al. , 2004 ; skirycz et al. , 2011 ) , rehydration after drought ( tudela et al. , 1992 ) , nutrient stress ( lynch and brown , 1997 ) and salinity ( feng and barker , 1992 ; ghanem et al. , 2008 ) .

figure reproduced from doubt ( 1917 ) .
( b ) acc translocation via the phloem was demonstrated by measuring total radioactivity over time in the stem ( st. ) , hypocotyl ( hy. ) , and apex ( ap. ) after the foliar application of radioactive acc to the oldest leaf ( leaf 1 ) of 21 day old cotton plants .
figure reproduced from morris and larcombe ( 1995 ) .
another long - distance acc transport system is achieved via the phloem .
foliar applied radioactive acc was found to be transported via the phloem to other aerial parts in tomato ( amrhein et al. , 1982 ) and in cotton plants ( morris and larcombe , 1995 ; figure 2b ) .
it should be noted that the foliar applied acc was also rapidly converted into macc , which was not found to be transported via the phloem ( morris and larcombe , 1995 ) .
this immobility of macc is in accordance with the earlier observations that macc is actively transported from the cytosol into the vacuoles , where it could be subsequently stored ( bouzayen et al. , 1988 , 1989 ; tophof et al. , 1989 ) .
interestingly , there could be a link between phloem transport of acc and the yang cycle .
pommerrenig et al .
( 2011 ) showed that yang cycle genes were specifically expressed in phloem , indicating that recycling of mta toward sam is preferentially carried out in this tissue .
perhaps mta recycling is stimulated by high rates of acc synthesis in phloem cells , or the recycled sam forms a pool for phloem - specific acc production .
in roots , spatiotemporal gene expression profiling demonstrated that different acs isoforms are expressed ( but not exclusively ) in the vascular tissue ( brady et al. , 2007 ; dugardeyn et al. , 2008 ) .
moreover , the loading of acc to this tissue could affect the homeostasis of sam and consequently , polyamines ( pommerrenig et al. , 2011 ) .
the exact molecular mechanism by which acc is loaded into the xylem and / or the phloem and subsequently transported throughout the plant is still unknown , but is an important element in our understanding of long - distance ethylene signaling via acc and how plants deal with different root and leaf stress conditions .
long - or medium - long - distance acc transport was also observed ( or speculated ) during different developmental processes .
tissue specific gene expression profiling of maize root cells showed that there are differences between acs and aco expression patterns ( gallie et al. , 2009 ) .
aco was predominantly expressed in the protophloem sieve elements and the companion cells , while acs was expressed only in the root cortex .
this discrepancy led the authors to hypothesize that acc could be transported from the site of synthesis to the site of consumption , in order to ensure the ethylene production levels observed ( gallie et al. , 2009 ) .
differences in acs and aco expression patterns predicted in silico in arabidopsis roots support the same hypothesis ( dugardeyn et al. , 2008 ) .
a similar reasoning was made by jones and woodson ( 1997 , 1999 ) , who observed differences in aco and acs transcripts in different cell - types of carnation flower .
they also postulated that acc transport from sites with a high acs expression ( in e.g. , petals and styles ) secured the ability of aco to produce ethylene in cells with a high aco expression ( for example the ovaries ; jones and woodson , 1997 , 1999 ). of course one should take into account that gene expression levels not always reflect actual protein levels , and that post - translational modifications can play an important role in protein stability and activity .

( 2014b ) investigated the tissue specificity of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway in tomato fruit .
they observed that the pericarp tissue produced the highest amount of ethylene ( and high aco activity ) , while the pericarp had the lowest acs activity and acc content compared to other tissues .
perhaps acc is transported from neighboring tissues with a high acs activity or acc content such as the locular gel , toward the pericarp in order to secure high rates of ethylene production during climacteric ripening of tomato ( van de poel et al. , 2014b ) .
besides long - distance , short - distance intracellular transport of acc was also observed in barley and wheat mesophyll cells ( tophof et al. , 1989 ) and maize mesophyll cells ( saftner and martin , 1993 ) .
acc is transported across the tonoplast by carriers that rely on an electrochemical potential gradient of protons , and which are stimulated by the supplementation of atp ( saftner and martin , 1993 ) .
this intracellular compartmentalization of acc allows the plant to precisely regulate the cellular pool of acc , possibly also affecting ethylene biosynthesis .
clearly , more research is needed to further unravel the exact molecular and biochemical mechanisms which assure intracellular , inter - and intra - tissue and long - distance acc transport in plants , and their corresponding physiological effects .
acc as a signaling molecule 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylic acid holds a key position in many physiological processes as it is the direct precursor in the biosynthesis of ethylene .
a balanced supply and consumption of acc is essential to achieve the necessary production level of ethylene within a given spatial and temporal context .
as shown above , the pool of acc is regulated by a complex interaction of production , consumption , modification , and transport .
interestingly , recent findings have suggested a perhaps even more important role for acc , as a signaling molecule independent from ethylene ( yoon and kieber , 2013 ) .
a first report by xu et al .
( 2008 ) investigated the role of acc signaling in relation with fei1 and fei2 , which are leucine - rich repeat receptor - like kinases .
the fei1 fei2 mutant displays a severe defect in anisotropic root growth due to a reduced cellulose microfiber content in the cell wall at the root tip ( figure 3 ) .
the fei1 fei2 phenotype can be reversed by the application of ethylene biosynthesis inhibitors , but not by ethylene signaling inhibitors .
the application of both aminooxy - acetic acid ( aoa ) or alpha - aminoisobutyric acid ( aib ) specifically inhibits ethylene biosynthesis and can reverse the phenotype of the fei1 fei2 mutant ( figure 3 ) .
aoa is an inhibitor of plp - dependent enzymes , and will affect the activity of acs resulting in a reduced ethylene production .
aib on the other hand is a structural analog of acc and acts as a competitive inhibitor of acc preventing ethylene production at the level of aco .
ethylene signaling inhibitors such as 1 - methylcyclopropane ( 1 - mcp ) and silver ions , did not affect the fei1 fei2 phenotype ( figure 3 ) .
similarly , genetics showed that the fei1 fei2 mutant crossed with etr1 - 3 ( a mutation in the ethylene receptor causing severe ethylene insensitivity ) , nor ein2 - 50 ( a central regulator of ethylene signaling causing ethylene insensitivity ) could reverse the phenotype .
all together this study showed that the typical fei1 fei2 phenotype was not affected by ethylene signaling , but could be reversed by ethylene biosynthesis inhibitors .
this suggests that the signal reversing the fei1 fei2 phenotype originated independent from ethylene signaling , involved acs and is possibly acc itself ( xu et al. , 2008 ) .
figure 3 role of acc / ethylene on the fei phenotype .
root phenotypes of seedlings grown on ms medium containing 0 % sucrose for 4 days and then transferred to ms medium containing 4.5 % sucrose , or additionally supplemented with aoa ( 0.375 mm ) or aib ( 1 mm ) as indicated .
note that the distribution of lateral roots in the fei1 fei2 mutants in the presence of high sucrose is variable ; the architecture of the fei1 fei2 ein2 triple mutant is not substantially different from that of the fei1 fei2 parent .
the close - ups of the root tips clearly show the typical swelling of the fei1 fei2 mutant .
( bar = 1 cm ) .
figure reproduced from xu et al .
( 2008 ) .
a second report by tsang et al .
( 2011 ) linked acc signaling with cell elongation and cell wall composition of roots .
specific ethylene biosynthesis inhibitors [ avg , aoa , and 2 - anilino - 7 - ( 4 - methoxyphenyl ) - 7,8 - dihydro - 5 ( 6h ) - quinazolinone ( 7303 )] could reverse the inhibition of root cell expansion which was induced by an isoxaben treatment ( a cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor causing cell wall stress ) .
similarly , as observed by xu et al .
( 2008 ) , an ethylene signaling inhibitor ( silver ions ) could not reverse the isoxaben - induced reduction in root cell elongation .
also , the ein3 eil1 ethylene insensitive mutant responded to acc and isoxaben , providing genetic evidence of an acc signaling mechanism independent of ethylene signaling .
they also showed that the application of acc without isoxaben , inhibited root cell elongation and was partially ethylene - dependent and partially ethylene - independent .
altogether , their results demonstrate that monitoring of cell wall integrity requires an acc sensing / signaling mechanism , which can result in a reduction of root cell elongation , when disrupted .
in addition , tsang et al .
( 2011 ) showed that this inhibition of root cell elongation required auxin and reactive oxygen species ( ros ) signaling , downstream of acc signaling .
in a third report ( tsuchisaka et al. , 2009 ) an octuple acs mutant was made to study the interplay between different acs isoforms .
the octuple line was created by introduction of two amirna lines ( acs8 and acs11 ) into the hexuple mutant acs2,4,5,6,7,9 creating an octuple mutant line with complete or severe inhibition of acs function .
the lines that showed a very strong silencing of acs8 and acs11 , displayed embryo lethality .
this suggests that ethylene biosynthesis ( or acc biosynthesis ) is essential for arabidopsis viability , while this is not the case for the single ( ctr1 and ein2 ) and double ( ctr1 ein2 ) ethylene signaling mutants ( kieber et al. , 1993 ; roman et al. , 1995 ; alonso et al. , 1999 ) .
this phenotypic discrepancy between ethylene biosynthesis and signaling once more suggests that acc can acts as a signaling molecule itself , independent from ethylene , at least during embryo development and arabidopsis viability .
in addition , tsuchisaka et al .
( 2009 ) characterized a wide variety of physiological and developmental processes of their single and multiple acs knock - out lines , and observed many phenotypes which were similar as for previously described ethylene signaling mutants .
but interestingly they also observed several phenotypes like reduced branching , which were not observed in ethylene - insensitive mutants .
these discrepancies could again be caused by acc acting as a signaling molecule .
however , it is also possible that individual acs members have unique roles in developmental processes , and that knocking - out multiple acs members might result in pleiotropic effects irrelevant to acc or ethylene metabolism .
finally , it must be noted that such a severe genetic interference in acc metabolism might also affect upstream sam or mta levels or the pool of downstream acc conjugates , which in turn could signal themselves and affect cell physiology to contribute to the phenotypic differences observed .
all together these reports suggest a role for acc as a signaling molecule to regulate plant development and growth , independent from ethylene .
the exact molecular mechanism by which acc signaling operates , and whether or not there is an acc receptor and downstream signaling components , remains to be investigated .
future biochemical studies with specific ethylene biosynthesis and signaling inhibitors , in combination with genetics to create higher order ethylene biosynthesis / signaling mutants ( like etr1ers1etr2ein4ers2ctr1ein2 or multiple aco knock - outs ) , could shed light on the role of acc as a signaling molecule .
it also still needs to be elucidated whether this unique title of " signaling molecule " is to be awarded to acc , or rather to one if its ( unknown ) downstream derivatives .
conclusion over the years , a lot of work has been done on acc since its discovery in 1979 , and it has become clear that acc is more than just the precursor of ethylene .
its role in ethylene biosynthesis is well characterized , although there are still many questions concerning the two unique proteins that are associated with acc in ethylene biosynthesis : acs and aco .
pioneering work on the characterization of post - translational modifications and the combinatorial interplay of acs isoforms , has opened our eyes to the complex regulation of ethylene biosynthesis at the protein level .
more mechanistic details are to be uncovered , probably including a complex post - translational control of aco .
furthermore , acc is conjugated into macc , gacc , and ja - acc .
these derivatives are an elegant biochemical shunt to regulate the pool of acc available for ethylene production , although it remains rather speculative what the exact biological roles are for these acc conjugates .
a better characterization of the participating enzymes is necessary to further elucidate the importunateness of acc derivatives .
furthermore , acc can also be used by bacterial ( and plant ) acc - deaminase , adding another layer of metabolic complexity to the regulation of acc levels .
it is also well established that acc can be easily transported over short ( intracellular and intra - tissue ) and long - distances ( via the xylem and phloem ) , providing the plant with an elaborate system to control local and remote ethylene responses .
last but not least , acc has been identified as a potential signaling molecule , independent of ethylene .
this property of acc is perhaps the most exciting , opening new avenues in acc research , with potentially profound effects on plant physiology .
the molecular mechanism by which acc is signaling and the identity of other putative signaling components in such an ' acc pathway ' remain to be discovered .

background decreased expression of the angiogenesis inhibitor adamts1 ( adam metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif , 1 ) has previously been reported during prostate cancer progression .
the aim of this study was to investigate the function of adamts1 in prostate tumors .
methods adamts1 was downregulated by shrna technology in the human prostate cancer cell line lncap ( androgen - dependent ) , originally expressing adamts1 , and was upregulated by transfection in its subline lncap - 19 ( androgen - independent ) , expressing low levels of adamts1 .
cells were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice and tumor growth , microvessel density ( mvd ) , blood vessel morphology , pericyte coverage and thrombospondin 1 ( tsp1 ) were studied in the tumor xenografts .
results modified expression of adamts1 resulted in altered blood vessel morphology in the tumors .
low expression levels of adamts1 were associated with small diameter blood vessels both in lncap and lncap - 19 tumors , while high levels of adamts1 were associated with larger vessels .
in addition , tsp1 levels in the tumor xenografts were inversely related to adamts1 expression .
mvd and pericyte coverage were not affected .
moreover , upregulation of adamts1 inhibited tumor growth of lncap - 19 , as evidenced by delayed tumor establishment .
in contrast , downregulation of adamts1 in lncap resulted in reduced tumor growth rate .
conclusions the present study demonstrates that adamts1 is an important regulatory factor of angiogenesis and tumor growth in prostate tumors , where modified adamts1 expression resulted in markedly changed blood vessel morphology , possibly related to altered tsp1 levels .
background extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteases are involved in several steps of cancer development and progression , including angiogenesis and metastasis. by cleavage of ecm components , proteases regulate endothelial cell migration and the selective release and modulation of pro - and anti - angiogenic factors [ 1 ] .
adamts1 ( adam metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif , 1 ) is a widely expressed matrix metalloproteinase with documented roles in angiogenesis and tumor biology [ 2 - 6 ] .
it has been described as a potent anti - angiogenic factor that effectively inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in experimental assays [ 2 ] .
as the name indicates , the adamts1 protein comprises a metalloproteinase domain and three thrombospondin ( tsp ) type i motifs [ 7 ] , both of which is important for the angioinhibitory capacity .
the tsp type i motifs of adamts1 have been reported to directly bind vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) 165 , and thereby block its angiogenic function [ 8 ] .
in addition , the metalloproteinase domain has the ability to release anti - angiogenic fragments through cleavage of matrix - bound tsp1 and - 2 [ 9 ] .
tsp1 is one of the most studied endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis , and downregulation of tsp1 is common in a variety of tumor types , including prostate cancer [ 10 ] .
adamts1 has been reported to efficiently inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in different experimental cancer models by blocking angiogenesis [ 3 - 5 ] , and decreased expression of adamts1 has been reported in human malignancies [ 11 - 13 ] .
however , the involvement of adamts1 in tumor progression is complex , with data also describing adamts1 as a tumor promoting factor [ 4 - 6 ] .
the tumor promoting effect is believed to involve the release of growth factors from ecm , and there are studies suggesting that the proteolytic status of adamts1 is of importance for its effect on tumor growth [ 4,5 ] .
in human prostate cancer , angiogenesis is related to clinical stage , progression , metastasis and survival [ 14 - 18 ] .
in addition , androgen - independent or castration resistant prostate cancer ( i.e. tumors relapsing from androgen deprivation therapy ) displays higher mvd compared to androgen - dependent tumors [ 19 - 21 ] .
thus , factors affecting regulation of blood vessels and angiogenesis are of importance for the progression of prostate cancer , and may also be candidate targets for anti - angiogenic treatment .
in a previous study , we identified adamts1 as a gene that was downregulated when the androgen - dependent human prostate cancer cell line lncap progressed into an androgen - independent subline , lncap - 19 [ 22 ] .
this transition into androgen - independency was also associated with enhanced malignancy , increased mvd , altered blood vessel morphology and less pericyte covered vessels [ 23 - 25 ] .
furthermore , decreased expression of adamts1 was found in tumor tissue from prostate cancer patients compared to benign prostate tissue , and low levels of adamts1 were associated with increased mvd and metastasis in androgen - independent tumors [ 19 ] .
this study was conducted to investigate the actual function of adamts1 in prostate cancer .
adamts1 expression was downregulated in lncap cells ( androgen - dependent ) with shrna technology and was upregulated in lncap - 19 ( androgen - independent ) by transfection with an expression vector containing full - length adamts1 .
we report that modified expression of adamts1 resulted in markedly changed blood vessel morphology and tsp1 levels in the tumor xenografts , while mvd and pericyte coverage was unaffected .
moreover , the effect of adamts1 on tumor growth was different in lncap and lncap - 19 .
the results from this study demonstrate that adamts1 is an important regulatory factor of angiogenesis and tumor growth in prostate tumors .
methods cell lines and cell culture the androgen - dependent human prostate cancer cell line lncap was obtained from american type culture collection ( atcc , manassas , va ) .
the androgen - independent cell line lncap - 19 was previously established from lncap in our laboratory and cells were maintained as previously described [ 23 ] .
expression vectors and transfection of cells suresilencing shrna plasmids for human adamts1 with neomycin (# kh01149n , sabiosciences , frederick , md ) were used to downregulate the expression of adamts1 by rna interference in lncap cells .
a plasmid expressing shrna that does not match any human , mouse or rat gene was included as control .
lncap - 19 cells were transfected with a mammalian expression vector containing the full - length wild - type mouse adamts1 [ 4 ] or empty control vector ( pcdna3 ) .
cells were transfected over night with 8 mug dna and 20 mul lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) in 6 ml culture medium without antibiotics .
three days after transfection , cells were subjected to selective pressure by adding geneticin ( 400 mug / ml , invitrogen ) .
three weeks later , stably transfected clones were isolated , expanded and screened for adamts1 expression by real - time rt - pcr and western blotting .
several clones were obtained and one clone from each group was selected for in vivo studies .
animal experiments isolated clones and wild - type cells were implanted subcutaneously in male athymic balb / c nude mice , 8 - 10 weeks old ( charles river laboratories , wilmington , ma ) .
the use of animals was approved by the animal ethical committee in gothenburg ( nr : 228 - 2006 ) .
two million cells , diluted in 100 mul culture medium and 100 mul matrigel ( bd biosciences , bedford , ma ) , were injected subcutaneously in the flank of the mice .
to represent the clinical situation , lncap cells ( wild - type = l wt , control transfected = lc and adamts1 shrna - transfected = la - ) were implanted in intact mice , while lncap - 19 cells ( wild - type = l19 wt , control transfected = l19c and adamts1 transfected = l19a +) were implanted in castrated mice .
each clone was implanted in eight mice .
mice used for implantation of lncap - 19 clones were castrated under anesthesia three days before inoculation .
in a separate control experiment l19c and l19a + were also implanted in intact mice .
tumors were measured with a caliper and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula ; ( length x width2 )/ 2 .
when tumor size reached about 1.3 cm3 , or after a maximum of 15 weeks , mice were sacrificed and tumors were removed and weighed .
tumor take rate was defined as percentage of animals with a palpable tumor at different time points after implantation .
tumor growth rate was calculated as tumor weight ( mg ) divided with the number of days from implantation to sacrifice , and then related to the growth rate of wt tumors .
one part of the tumors was fixed in formalin for paraffin embedding and one part was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in - 80degreesc .
rna preparation and real - time rt - pcr total rna from cells and tumor tissue was isolated with the rneasy plus mini kit and treated with rnase - free dnase i ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
rna concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically , and the integrity of rna was confirmed by gel electrophoresis .
reverse transcription of total rna was performed as previously described [ 22 ] .
real - time rt - pcr was performed with taqman gene expression assays in a 7500 fast real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) , according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
the taqman gene expression assays used were ; human adamts1 ( hs00199608 _ m1 ) , mouse adamts1 ( mm00477355 _ m1 ) and 18s ( hs99999901 _ s1 ) .
the real - time rt - pcr analysis was performed in duplicates and was repeated twice .
data were analyzed according to the deltadeltact method for relative quantification according to applied biosystems' instructions and were normalized to the expression of 18s rrna .
protein preparation and western blotting protein extraction and western blotting was performed as previously described [ 22 ] .
primary antibodies used were against ; human adamts1 ( 1:500 , # a4476 , sigma - aldrich , st louis , mo ) , mouse adamts1 ( 1:5000 , kindly provided by prof. joanne s. richards [ 26 ]) , and tsp1 ( 1:400 , # ms - 421 - p1 , neomarkers , fremont , ca ) .
the tsp - 1 antibody reacts with the c - terminal of the protein and has earlier been reported to detect full - length tsp1 and adamts1 cleaved tsp1 [ 9 ] .
as loading control an antibody against actin ( 1:500 , # a2066 , sigma - aldrich ) was used .
chemiluminescent signals were visualized by the las - 4000 ccd camera ( fujifilm , tokyo , japan ) and semi - quantitative analysis of immunoreactive bands was performed with the free computer software imagej http :// rsb.info.nih.gov / ij / .
cell proliferation assay cells were seeded in triplicates in 96 - well plates at a density of 5000 cells / well in regular culture medium .
cells were incubated for four days and then frozen at - 80degreesc .
proliferation was analyzed using the cyquant cell proliferation assay kit ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
a fluorescent dye that binds to dna was added and fluorescence was measured with a victor3 multilabel plate reader ( perkinelmer , waltham , ma ) .
proliferation experiments were repeated twice .
detection of blood vessels in tumors mvd , blood vessel morphology and pericyte coverage were analyzed by immunohistochemistry .
for determination of mvd and blood vessel morphology , sections were stained with an antibody against cd34 ( 1:20 , # ab8158 , abcam , cambridge , uk ) .
to analyze pericyte coverage , another set of sections were double stained with the cd34 antibody and an antibody against alpha - sma ( 1:20 , # a5691 , sigma - aldrich ) .
immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [ 22,25 ] .
mvd was evaluated by counting the number of cd34 - positive vessels in five objective fields of representative areas in each section .
blood vessel morphology was assessed by grouping the tumors into two groups according to the form and distribution of vessels .
tumors characterized by large , thick and singly distributed vessels , often with a visible lumen were denoted as lv ( large vessels ) , while tumors characterized by small and thin vessels forming networks without a visible lumen were assigned as sv ( small vessels ) .
the evaluation was based on the total area of the section and included both peripheral and central parts of the tumor .
to evaluate pericyte coverage index , all cd34 - positive vessels associated with alpha - sma positive cells were counted and divided with the total number of cd34 - positive vessels in five objective fields in each section .
all analyses were performed independently by two investigators at 200 x magnification .
statistical analyses data are presented as mean +/ - sem .
mann whitney u test was used to compare differences between groups .
fisher 's exact test was used to compare the tumor take rate between groups .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
all statistical analyses were performed using spss 16.0 software for windows .
results modified expression of adamts1 in lncap and lncap - 19 cells lncap cells ( l wt ) that originally express significant amounts of adamts1 were stably transfected with shrna plasmids against adamts1 ( la - ) or control vector ( lc ) .
lncap - 19 cells ( l19 wt ) , originally expressing low amounts of adamts1 , were stably transfected with an expression vector containing the full - length adamts1 ( l19a +) or control vector ( l19c ) .
to represent the clinical situation lncap cells were inoculated in intact mice , while lncap - 19 cells were implanted in castrated mice .
real - time rt - pcr and western blotting analysis revealed significantly decreased mrna and protein levels of adamts1 in la - tumors compared to lc tumors ( figure 1a , b , c ) and an obvious increase in adamts1 expression in l19a + tumors compared to l19c tumors ( figure 1d , e , f ) .
both the latent form ( 110 kda ) and the active form ( 87 kda ) of adamts1 protein that are present in lncap were also present in l19a + tumors .

tumor growth of lncap and lncap - 19 was differently affected by adamts1 decreased levels of adamts1 did not affect tumor take of androgen - dependent lncap cells ( figure 2a ) , but strongly inhibited tumor growth rate .
tumor growth rate , measured as tumor weight / days in relation to lncap wt , was reduced with approximately 80 % from 1.05 (+/ - 0.16 ) in lc tumors to 0.20 (+/ - 0.07 ) in la - tumors ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 2b ) .
measurements of tumor volumes displayed similar results ( figure 2c ) .
however , the proliferation rate in vitro was not affected ( figure 2d ) .
in contrast , increased levels of adamts1 in lncap - 19 resulted in markedly slower tumor establishment .
all mice in the l19c group had palpable tumors already after one week , while tumors in the l19a + group gradually became palpable during 9 weeks ( figure 3a ) .
the relative tumor growth rate was 1.03 (+/ - 0.23 ) in l19c tumors and 0.66 (+/ - 0.18 ) in l19a + tumors ( p = 0.279 ) ( figure 3b ) .
similar results were obtained when measuring tumor volumes ( figure 3c ) .
however , there was no statistically significant effect on tumor growth rate once tumors were established .
no difference in proliferation rate was observed in vitro ( figure 3d ) .

four days later , dna was quantified by a fluorescent dye and values were related to the wild - type cells .
mean +/ - sem of two independent experiments with triplicates are shown .
the discrepancy in tumor growth regulation between lncap and lncap - 19 was not due to the fact that lncap - 19 tumors were growing in castrated mice , while lncap tumors were growing in intact mice , since similar results were obtained when l19c and l19a + cells were implanted in intact mice as control ( figure 3b ) .
adamts1 altered tumor blood vessel morphology but not mvd or pericyte coverage modified expression of adamts1 induced a clear difference in blood vessel morphology .
in lncap tumors , blood vessels in the l wt and lc groups were observed as singly distributed vessels that were larger , thicker and rounder in shape often with a visible lumen ( assigned as lv = large vessels ) .
in contrast , when adamts1 was downregulated ( la - ) , the tumors were dominated by small and thin vessels forming long networks , mainly without a visible lumen ( assigned as sv = small vessels ) .
the blood vessel morphology was similarly affected by adamts1 expression in lncap - 19 tumors .
the tumors with low adamts1 ( l19 wt and l19c ) were dominated by smaller and thinner vessel networks ( sv ) , while l19a + tumors displayed singly distributed blood vessels that were rounder and thicker in shape ( lv ) ( figure 4 ) .
however , adamts1 did not affect mvd ( figure 5a , c ) or the proportion of alpha - sma positive vessels , representing pericyte covered vessels ( figure 5b , d ) , neither in lncap nor in lncap - 19 tumors .

adamts1 affected the tsp1 levels in tumors since adamts1 has been reported to cleave tsp1 , we analyzed the protein forms of tsp1 by western blotting .
tsp1 was detected as two immunoreactive bands of approximately the same size that previously was described as full - length tsp1 ( 145 kda ) and adamts1 cleaved tsp1 ( 110 kda ) [ 9 ] .
however , modified expression of adamts1 did not alter the ratio between the two detected protein forms either in lncap or lncap - 19 tumors .
instead , the total protein levels of detected tsp1 were markedly affected by adamts1 levels .
tsp1 was present in l19 wt , but not in l wt. downregulation of adamts1 in lncap resulted in increased levels of tsp1 ( figure 6a , b ) , and upregulation of adamts1 in lncap - 19 was associated with decreased levels of tsp1 ( figure 6c , d ) .

discussion in the present study , we modified the expression of adamts1 in an experimental model of prostate cancer to investigate the function of this protein .
the main findings were that adamts1 altered the blood vessel morphology and tsp1 levels in the tumor xenografts .
in addition , the tumor growth was differently affected by adamts1 in androgen - dependent lncap and androgen - independent lncap - 19 tumors .
in prostate cancer , an increased angiogenesis is observed in androgen - independent and metastatic disease and this is probably important for the rapid growth and spreading of the cancer [ 17,19,23 ] .
since adamts1 is known as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in other systems and previously has been reported to decrease during prostate cancer progression , we investigated its effects on tumor blood vessels .
interestingly , we found that modified expression of adamts1 markedly altered the blood vessel morphology in these tumor xenografts , while the number of blood vessels was unaffected .
during the transition of lncap into lncap - 19 , an altered blood vessel morphology was observed together with increased mvd and the loss of adamts1 [ 22,23 ] .
in this study , downregulation of adamts1 in lncap resulted in a blood vessel phenotype characteristic of lncap - 19 tumors with small diameter vessels forming long networks. by upregulation of adamts1 in lncap - 19 , the vessel morphology could be reversed into a phenotype resembling the blood vessels in lncap tumors , characterized by larger vessels .
these results demonstrate that adamts1 is a regulator of blood vessel biology also in prostate tumors .
the significance of this switch in blood vessel morphology for tumor progression is not extensively investigated .
however , it was recently shown in a large prospective study of prostate cancer patients that the vessel morphology is of importance for the clinical outcome .
it was shown that small blood vessels were associated with poorly differentiated tumors .
more interestingly , men whose tumors had a small vessel diameter or a small vessel area were about 6 times more likely to develop lethal prostate cancer , even after adjustment for age , differentiation ( gleason score ) and psa [ 27 ] .
this new data together with our results presented here , implies that loss of adamts1 could be an important mediator of the progression into more aggressive prostate cancer .
adamts1 has previously been reported to regulate angiogenesis by cleaving tsp1 , which results in the release of tsp1 from ecm and thereby to decreased angiogenesis [ 9 ] .
however , modified adamts1 expression did not affect the cleavage of tsp1 in lncap or lncap - 19 tumors .
instead , we found that adamts1 expression was inversely related to the total levels of tsp1 in the tumor xenografts .
since tsp1 is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor , this may explain why the mvd in the tumor xenografts was not affected by altered levels of adamts1 .
interestingly , tsp1 has also been described to affect blood vessel morphology .
mammary tumors in tsp1 - null mice have been reported to display significantly larger blood vessels than tumors in wild - type mice [ 28,29 ] .
this is in accordance with our study , where decreased expression of adamts1 was associated with increased tsp1 and a switch from large vessels into small vessels , while overexpression of adamts1 resulted in loss of tsp1 and a switch back to larger vessels .
thus , the adamts1 - mediated effect on tsp1 levels could be a possible mechanism responsible for the switch in blood vessel morphology observed .
tumor blood vessels are often characterized by decreased pericyte coverage , making them less stabilized , more permeable and more sensitive to angiogenic stimuli [ 30 ] .
lncap tumors have previously been described to have more vessels stabilized by pericytes than lncap - 19 tumors [ 25 ] .
however , modified expression of adamts1 did not influence the degree of pericyte coverage , indicating that altered vessel stabilization by pericytes is not involved in the altered blood vessel morphology observed .
adamts1 is a multifunctional protein reported to have both pro - and anti - tumorigenic properties .
transition of the cell line lncap into its more malignant subline lncap - 19 has previously been reported to result in loss of adamts1 together with a more rapid tumor establishment [ 22,23 ] .
also in the human prostate , adamts1 was downregulated in tumor tissue compared to benign tissue and decreased expression of adamts1 was associated with increased angiogenesis and metastasis in androgen - independent tumors [ 19 ] .
in this study , re - expression of adamts1 in lncap - 19 greatly delayed tumor establishment , indicating that adamts1 actually might function as a tumor suppressor of androgen - independent prostate tumors .
however , once tumors were established the lncap - 19 cells seem to escape from this inhibitory effect of adamts1 , since no obvious difference in tumor growth rate was observed. that increased expression of adamts1 is associated with a less malignant phenotype of androgen - independent prostate tumors has also been shown in pc - 3 tumors [ 31 ] .
however , downregulation of adamts1 in lncap resulted in a reduced tumor growth rate , suggesting that adamts1 rather is a tumor promoting factor in androgen - dependent lncap tumors .
other experimental studies also report conflicting data regarding adamts1 as a pro - or anti - tumorigenic factor , and the proteolytic status of adamts1 has been proposed to be of importance for its effect [ 4,5 ] .
however , in this study adamts1 was only detected in its latent and full - length active form in both lncap and lncap - 19 tumors , suggesting that this is not the reason to the difference in tumor growth regulation in this model .
since adamts1 is a multifunctional protein mainly acting indirectly on tumor cells by regulating the availability and activity of factors present in the ecm , the constitution of the surrounding ecm is probably of great importance for the net effect of adamts1 .
conclusions in conclusion , modified adamts1 expression resulted in markedly changed blood vessel morphology and altered tsp1 levels in the tumors .
loss of adamts1 was associated with small diameter vessels that have been associated with more aggressive prostate tumors .
altogether , the results presented in this paper further support that adamts1 is an important regulatory factor of tumor growth and angiogenesis during prostate cancer progression .

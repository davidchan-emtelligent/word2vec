background ventricular septal rupture is a potentially fatal complication of acute myocardial infarction .
its incidence has declined with modern reperfusion therapy .
in the era of percutaneous coronary interventions , it occurs a median of 18 - 24 hours after myocardial infarction and is most commonly associated with anterior myocardial infarction .
we present a case of delayed ventricular septal rupture complicating acute inferior wall myocardial infarction .
case presentation a 53 - year - old caucasian male presented with epigastric pain for three days and electrocardiographic evidence for an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction .
coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery .
reperfusion was achieved by balloon angioplasty followed by placement of a bare metal stent .
on hospital day six , the patient developed acute respiratory distress , a new loud pansystolic murmur , and hemodynamic instability .
echocardiography revealed the presence of a large defect in the inferobasal interventricular septum with significant left - to - right shunt consistent with ventricular septal rupture .

myocardial infarction echocardiography ventricular septal rupture surgery background ventricular septal rupture ( vsr ) is a potentially fatal complication of acute myocardial infarction .
without surgical repair , patients with vsr have an in - hospital mortality rate of 90 %. with surgical repair , the in - hospital mortality rate is still 33 - 45 % [ 1,2 ] .
before the era of reperfusion therapy , the incidence of vsr was 1 - 3 % [ 3 ] , declining to 0.2 - 0.3 % with the advent of thrombolytic therapy [ 4 ] .
in the modern era of ubiquitous percutaneous coronary interventions ( pci ) , vsr has become a rare finding in patients with acute myocardial infarction. with reperfusion therapy , the median time from the onset of myocardial infarction to the diagnosis of vsr has shortened to 18 - 24 hours as opposed to 5 days in the pre - reperfusion era [ 3,5,6 ] .
we present the case of delayed ventricular septal rupture complicating acute inferior wall myocardial infarction .
case presentation a 53 - year - old caucasian male presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain for three days .
the electrocardiogram ( ecg ) showed 2 mm coved st segment elevation in the inferior leads and q waves in leads iii and avf suggestive of acute inferior myocardial wall infarction ( figure 1 ) .
he underwent emergent coronary angiography which revealed a diffusely diseased left coronary system ( figure 2a ) and a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery ( figure 2b ) .
coronary blood flow was successfully restored with balloon angioplasty followed by placement of a bare metal stent ( figure 2c ) .
however , the right coronary artery remained partially occluded after the bifurcation due to distal embolization .
transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) showed akinesis of the basal inferior myocardial segment .
on hospital day six , the patient developed the sudden onset of respiratory distress and hemodynamic instability with a new loud pansystolic murmur heard over the entire precordium .
repeat tte showed a high velocity left - to - right turbulent jet across the inferobasal septum indicative of a vsr ( figure 3a ) .
dilatation of the right ventricle was also noted ( figure 3b ) .
the patient became tachypneic , tachycardic and hypotensive , and required placement of an intra - aortic balloon pump for hemodynamic support .
a transesophageal echocardiogram ( tee ) confirmed the presence of a large defect in the inferobasal septum measuring approximately 1.6 cm causing a significant left - to - right shunt consistent with vsr ( figure 3c and d ) .
the patient underwent emergent repair of the vsr with a bovine pericardial patch .
his postoperative course was uncomplicated .

b ) thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery at the ostium .
note the absence of ipsilateral or contralateral collateral circulation .
c ) following reperfusion , the right coronary artery shows marginal flow past the bifurcation due to distal embolization .
the posterior descending and posterior lateral coronary arteries are faintly visible .

b ) transthoracic echocardiogram in the parasternal long axis view showing significant right ventricular enlargement ( proximal right ventricular outflow tract in this image ) secondary to left - to - right shunt and volume overload .
c ) transesophageal echocardiogram from a modified transgastric view at 0degrees demonstrates a 1.6 cm defect in the inferobasal septum at the level of the mitral valve ( mv ) and tricuspid valve ( tv ) .
d ) high velocity turbulent flow of left - to - right shunt by color doppler across the ventricular septal rupture noted in c. discussion rupture of the ventricular septum is a rare but well recognized complication of acute myocardial infarction .
reperfusion therapy usually prevents extensive myocardial necrosis thus decreasing the incidence of vsr .
without reperfusion , myocardial necrosis develops within 3 - 5 days [ 3 ] .
in the shock trial registry , the median time from myocardial infarction to vsr was 18 hours ( interquartile range , 5 hours to 36 hours ) after thrombolytic therapy [ 6 ] .
however , pci sometimes can cause reperfusion injury and induce more damage to the infracted myocardium , especially in cases with total occlusion of the infarct - related artery and minimal collateral circulation [ 5,7 ] .
vsr occurs in the setting of anterior myocardial infarction 70 % of the time and complicates inferior myocardial infarction in 29 % of the cases [ 5 ] .
the culprit vessel was the left anterior descending artery in 64 % of patients and the right coronary artery in 28 % of patients in the gusto - i trial [ 5 ] .
the location of vsr was apical in 66 % and basal in 34 % of patients who developed vsr after acute myocardial infarction [ 4 ] .
our patient developed symptoms 3 days prior to seeking medical attention and rupture of the inferobasal septum , which is supplied by the right coronary artery occurred six days after revascularization .
the late - onset vsr in the setting of acute inferior myocardial infarction is a rare finding in view of reperfusion therapy with pci .
both tte and tee are effective imaging modalities to establish the diagnosis and exclude other mechanical complications of myocardial infarction with similar clinical presentation .
the sensitivity and specificity of color doppler echocardiography for detecting a shunt at the ventricular septal level have been reported as high as 100 % [ 3 ] .
risk factors for the development of vsr include old age , female gender , anterior myocardial infarction , and single vessel disease , specifically left anterior descending artery [ 3,5 ] .
the treatment of vsr is emergent surgical repair but even with surgical repair , the in - hospital mortality rate is in the 33 - 45 % range [ 1,2 ] .
recently , transcatheter ventricular septal closure has shown promising results in the treatment of vsr with a 30 - day mortality rate of 35 % .
it can be considered as an alternative to surgical repair in hemodynamically stable patients [ 4 ] .
in our patient , surgery was selected because of hemodynamic instability .
conclusion although the incidence of vsr has significantly decreased in the modern era of pci , septal rupture after myocardial infarction should be suspected in the presence of new physical findings and hemodynamic compromise regardless of revascularization therapy .

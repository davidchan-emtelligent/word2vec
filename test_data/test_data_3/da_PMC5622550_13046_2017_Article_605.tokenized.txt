background glioblastoma ( gb ) is the most malignant brain tumor in adults .
it is characterized by angiogenesis and a high proliferative and invasive capacity .
standard therapy ( surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide ) is of limited efficacy .
innovative anticancer drugs targeting both tumor cells and angiogenesis are urgently required , together with effective systems for their delivery to the brain .
we assessed the ability of human mesenchymal stromal cells ( mscs ) to uptake the multikinase inhibitor , sorafenib ( sfn ) , and to carry this drug to a brain tumor following intranasal administration .
method mscs were primed with sfn and drug content and release were quantified by analytical chemistry techniques .
the ability of sfn - primed mscs to inhibit the survival of the human u87mg gb cell line and endothelial cells was assessed in in vitro assays .
these cells were then administered intranasally to nude mice bearing intracerebral u87mg xenografts .
their effect on tumor growth and angiogenesis was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and immunofluorescence analyses , and was compared with the intranasal administration of unprimed mscs or sfn alone .
results mscs took up about 9 pg sfn per cell , with no effect on viability , and were able to release 60 % of the primed drug .
the cytostatic activity of the released sfn was entirely conserved , resulting in a significant inhibition of u87mg and endothelial cell survival in vitro .
two intranasal administrations of sfn - primed mscs in u87mg - bearing mice resulted in lower levels of tumor angiogenesis than the injection of unprimed mscs or sfn alone , but had no effect on tumor volume .
we also observed an increase in the proportion of small intratumoral vessels in animals treated with unprimed mscs ; this effect being abolished if the mscs were primed with sfn .
conclusion we show the potential of mscs to carry sfn to brain tumors following an intranasal administration .
however , the therapeutic effect is modest probably due to the pro - tumorigenic properties of mscs , which may limit the action of the released sfn .
this calls into question the suitability of mscs for use in gb therapy and renders it necessary to find methods guaranteeing the safety of this cellular vector after drug delivery .
keywords drug delivery glioblastoma mesenchymal stromal cells targeting sorafenib issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background glioblastoma ( gb ) is the most common , invasive and aggressive primary brain tumor in humans .
over the last 12 years or so , most patients with gb have been treated with the stupp protocol [ 1 ] , consisting of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide ( tmz ) chemotherapy .
the efficacy of this treatment is limited , with median overall survival of no more than 15 months [ 2 ] .
gb treatment is complicated by the high resistance of these tumors to standard chemotherapy agents , the critical role of angiogenesis in their growth and spread and the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) , which serves as a physiological obstacle to the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system .
the development of innovative anticancer drugs targeting both tumor cells and blood vessels is therefore urgently required , together with effective systems for delivering these drugs to the brain .
in recent years , targeted molecular therapies based on the use of inhibitors of several pathways involved in the oncogenic process in gb have emerged [ 3 - 5 ] .
sorafenib ( sfn ) ( nexavar ) is one such inhibitor .
it is an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets both cell surface kinase receptors ( vegfr and pdgfr ) and downstream intracellular serine / threonine kinases [ 6 ] resulting in diverse cellular effects , such as induction of tumor cell apoptosis and autophagy , and reduction of angiogenesis [ 7 - 9 ] .
sfn showed efficacy against different solid tumors and is already approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma , renal cell carcinoma , and thyroid cancer [ 6 ] .
in clinical studies in patients with progressive or recurrent gb , oral administration of sfn has been shown to be of very limited efficacy as a monotherapy or in combination with tmz or other targeted drugs , such as erlotinib [ 10 - 16 ] .
this lack of efficacy is not restricted to sfn ; other drugs fell short of expectations because they penetrated the brain only inefficiently via the bbb or were unable to target tumor cells .
various approaches have been developed to overcome these limitations , including the use of mesenchymal stromal cells ( mscs ) , which can cross the bbb and display brain tumor tropism after systemic and local administration [ 17 - 21 ] .
this property has generated considerable interest in the use of mscs as treatment vectors for gb [ 22 - 25 ] .
mscs have been genetically modified to overexpress several antitumor factors , such as interleukins , interferons , pro - drugs , oncolytic viruses , anti - angiogenic agents , pro - apoptotic proteins , and growth factor antagonists [ 26 , 27 ] .
despite promising results in animal models , the genetic manipulation of mscs for clinical application is not risk - free [ 28 ] .
we and others have shown that mscs can deliver chemotherapy drugs to brain tumors without genetic modification [ 29 - 33 ] .
for example , we have shown that mscs can deliver lipid nanocapsules containing an organometallic complex ( ferrociphenol ) in the heterotopic and orthotopic u87mg gb models [ 29 , 31 ] .
mscs were also able to take up and release paclitaxel and to induce cytotoxic damage in gb xenografts [ 32 , 34 ] .
a major concern to use these therapeutic cells is the delivery method .
the surgical injection of mscs directly into the brain is the most frequently used method of delivery .
however , this method is invasive making a repeated treatment option difficult .
in a clinical context , systemic administration of this therapeutic tool would be simpler , less costly and would allow for a chronic treatment .
intravascular applications of mscs could be an option but major obstacles are the entrapment and elimination of cells in peripheral organs and the risk of vascular and pulmonary embolization [ 35 , 36 ] .
intranasal administration of mscs appears to be a promising noninvasive and safe alternative delivery method to surgical injection or to intravascular administration [ 37 ] .
intranasally administered mscs were able to enter the brain in experimental glioma models [ 19 ] as well as in mouse models of alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease [ 38 ] and neonate ischemic brain damage models [ 39 ] .
in this study , we evaluated the ability of mscs to take up sfn and target it to the tumor in the orthotopic u87mg gb model , following intranasal administration .
we paid particular interest to the effects of sfn - primed mscs on tumor growth and angiogenesis , through comparisons with the intranasal administration of unprimed mscs or sfn alone .
methods cell culture and reagents mscs were obtained from iliac crest aspirates from a human male post - mortem organ donor ( protocol agreed by the french agency of biomedicine ) , and were isolated as previously described [ 17 , 40 ] .
this cell population was expanded by culture in stemmacs ( tm ) msc expansion media kit xf ( miltenyi biotec , paris , france ) in a humidified incubator at 37 degreesc , under an atmosphere containing 5 % co2 , until 70 % confluence .
all experiments were performed with cells between passages 4 and 5 .
the human u87mg gb cell line was obtained from the atcc ( lgc promochem , molsheim , france ) .
cells were maintained in dulbecco 's modified eagle medium - high glucose medium ( dmem - hg , lonza , verviers , belgium ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) ( fisher scientific , illkirch , france ) and 1 % antibiotics ( sigma - aldrich , st. quentin fallavier , france ) , under an atmosphere containing 5 % co2 ( 37 degreesc ) , in a humidified incubator , until they reached 80 % confluence .
human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) were purchased from lonza .
cells were cultured according to the supplier 's instructions , in endothelial cell growth medium - 2 ( egm - 2 ) in a humidified chamber at 37 degreesc , under an atmosphere containing 5 % co2 .
sfn was purchased from lc laboratories ( woburn , usa ) .
the stock solution was prepared in dmso ( sigma - aldrich ) , at a concentration of 100 mm. aliquots were stored at - 20 degreesc .
sensitivity of huvecs , u87mg and mscs to sfn huvecs and u87mg cells were plated in 96 - well plates at densities of 5 x 103 cells / cm2 and mscs were plated at a density of 1 x 104 cells / cm2 .
after 48 h , the culture medium was removed and cells were treated with sfn at concentrations of 0.001 to 100 mum .
four days later , the medium was removed from the wells and the plates were stored at - 80 degreesc until their use for assays .
cell survival was estimated with the cyquant ( r ) cell proliferation assay kit , according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( fisher scientific ) .
priming of mscs with sfn mscs ( 4 x 105 cells ) were incubated for 1 h at 37 degreesc with 1 ml sfn ( 20 or 100 mum ) in hank 's balanced salt solution ( hbss ) , with ca2 + and mg2 + ( lonza ) .
at the end of the incubation period , cells were washed twice with hbss , counted , and used for in vitro and in vivo experiments , as described below .
in vitro characterization of sfn - primed mscs sfn content of sfn - primed mscs the sfn content of mscs was measured by high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) method .
sfn - primed mscs ( 4 x 105 cells ) were suspended in 50 mul h2o .
we then successively added 50 mul tetrahydrofuran and 200 mul methanol .
a filtration was performed using a millex - lg 0.2 mum filter ( millipore , guyancourt , france ) and 10 mul was injected onto the hplc system .
chromatography was performed with the waters modular system ( 600 / 717 / 996 / 2414 ) ( waters , saint - quentin - en - yvelynes , france ) on a sunfire ( r ) c18 column ( 150 x 4.6 mm ; 5 mum ) at 37 degreesc .
sfn was eluted with an isocratic mobile phase ( acetonitrile / methanol / 1 % acetic acid , at a ratio of 35:38:27 ) at a flow rate of 1 ml / min , with monitoring at 266 nm. the chromatograms were recorded and integrated with empower 3 software ( waters ) .
the range of linear response was 0.5 - 32 mug / ml. viability of sfn - primed mscs sfn - primed mscs were used to seed 96 - well plates , and cell survival was estimated one and seven days later , with the cyquant ( r ) cell proliferation assay kit , as described above .
release of sfn from sfn - primed mscs sfn - primed mscs ( 3 x 105 ) were used to seed transwell ( r ) inserts with a pore size of 0.4 mum ( millipore ) in dmem - hg supplemented with 10 % fbs and 1 % antibiotics .
we monitored sfn release at different time points , by collecting the cell - conditioned medium ( cm ) from the lower compartment at 4 , 24 , 48 , 72 and 96 h. quantification of sfn in the cm was determined by liquid chromatography tandem - mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) .
chromatography was performed with the waters alliance ( r ) 2695 system , with an uptisphere ( r ) 5 odb c18 column ( 150 x 2.0 mm ) ( interchim , montlucon , france ) .
the mobile phase consisted of an isocratic mixture of 0.1 % formic acid in water / 0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile : 20 / 80 ( v / v ) .
the column temperature was set at 25 degreesc and the flow rate was 0.3 ml / min , with a total run time of 10 min .
the total hplc effluent was analyzed in a quattro ( r ) micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ( waters ) .
ionization was achieved by the electrospray method , in positive - ion mode .
the mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction monitoring ( mrm ) mode .
the ( m - h ) + m / z transition for sfn was 465 - - > 270 .
a typical retention time for sfn was 2.3 min .
quantification was achieved with quantlynx ( r ) ( waters ) , by comparing the observed peak area ratios of sfn samples with a calibration curve obtained under the same experimental conditions .
the range of the linear response was large , extending from 50 to 1000 ng / ml. toxicity of sfn - primed mscs to u87mg cells and huvecs we assessed the in vitro toxicity of sfn - primed mscs to u87mg cells and huvecs , by performing coculture experiments in transwell ( r ) plates , with inserts with a pore size of 0.4 mum ( millipore ) .
huvecs and u87mg cells ( 6 x 103 cells / well ) were placed in the lower compartment .
after 48 h , we added sfn , or unprimed or sfn - primed mscs to the upper compartment .
three days later , the inserts were removed and a cyquant ( r ) cell proliferation assay was performed .
in vivo effect of sfn - primed mscs u87mg gb model female swiss nude mice ( 8 - 10 weeks old ) were obtained from charles river laboratories ( l'arbresle , france ) .
the protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments of the " pays de la loire " ( permit no. 01785.01 ) .
animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of xylazine ( 13 mg / kg body weight ) and ketamine ( 100 mg / kg body weight ) and were positioned in a kopf stereotaxic instrument .
on day 0 ( d0 ) , u87mg cells ( 3 x 104 ) in 5 mul hbss with ca2 + and mg2 + were injected into the striatum of mice [ coordinates : 2.1 mm lateral to the bregma , 0.5 mm anterior and 3 mm interior to the outer border of the cranium ] .
analysis of the distribution of mscs in the u87mg tumor after their intranasal administration intranasal delivery was performed as previously described [ 19 ] , but with minor modifications .
thirty minutes before cell administration , anesthetized u87mg tumor - bearing mice ( d12 ) were placed in a supine position and the nasal cavity of each animal was treated with total of 100 u hyaluronidase ( sigma - aldrich ) in the form of four repeated inoculations at two - minute intervals ( 3 mul per nostril ) .
we then applied either hbss with ca2 + and mg2 + , or 6 x 105 mscs in the same conditions .
for analysis of the distribution of mscs in the u87mg tumor , the animals were killed three or seven days later ( d15 and d19 , respectively ) .
brains were snap - frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 degreesc .
coronal sections of the brain were cut at 10 mum intervals and collected on silane - treated slides .
mscs in tumor cryosections were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) , with a human y - chromosome probe , as previously described [ 34 ] .
the dna probe was complementary to the highly repetitive human satellite iii sequences located close to the centromeric region of the human y - chromosome dyz1 locus ( cepy ) and was labeled with the spectrumorange fluorochrome ( vysis , abbott molecular , rungis , france ) .
cryosections of four mice killed at day 15 or day 19 were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope ( axioscope ( r ) 2 light microscope , zeiss , le pecq , germany ) .
y + mscs were counted on nine cryosections per mouse corresponding to the central and peripheral portions of the tumor , with the metaview computerized image - analysis system ( roper scientific , evry , france ) .
about five fields per cryosection , at a magnification of x200 , were randomly selected for each tumor .
analysis of the effect of sfn - primed mscs in the orthotopic u87mg gb model u87mg tumor - bearing mice ( d6 ) were assigned to four groups receiving intranasal injections according to the protocol described above : ( a ) hbss with ca2 + and mg2 + ; ( b ) sfn ; ( c ) unprimed mscs ; ( d ) sfn - primed mscs .
these injections were repeated on day 10 .
seven days later , we measured tumor volume by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , as previously described [ 31 ] , and the mice were killed for the analysis of ki67 + cells or cd31 + vessels in the u87mg tumor .
the presence of intratumoral y + mscs in all u87mg tumor - bearing mice treated with unprimed or sfn - primed mscs was checked by fish .
for cd31 and ki67 expression analysis , brain cryosections were allowed to dry in air , rehydrated in pbs and fixed by incubation for 10 min in 4 % pfa ph 7.4 at 4 degreesc .
nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the sections in 4 % bsa and 10 % normal goat serum in pbs .
the sections were incubated overnight , at 4 degreesc , with isotype controls and primary antibodies against endothelial cells ( mouse cd31 , bd biosciences , le pont de claix , france ) and proliferative cells ( ki67 , agilent technologies , les ulis , france ) .
the primary antibodies were detected with biotinylated secondary antibodies and the signal was amplified with streptavidin - fitc ( interchim ) .
nuclei were counterstained with dapi ( sigma ) .
cryosections of four mice from each of the groups described above ( a , b , c and d ) were analyzed under an axioscope ( r ) 2 fluorescence microscope .
cd31 + and ki67 + cells were counted with the metaview computerized image - analysis system in six brain cryosections per mouse corresponding to the central and peripheral portions of the tumor .
five fields per cryosection , at x200 magnification , were randomly selected for each tumor .
statistical analysis results are expressed as means +/ - sem .
the kruskal - wallis test was used for statistical analyses .
differences were considered significant if the p - value was < 0.05 .
results effect of sfn on the survival of u87mg cells , huvecs and mscs both u87mg cells and huvecs displayed dose - dependent survival inhibition when treated for 4 days with sfn ( fig. 1 ) .
sfn decreased cell viability with an ic50 of 7.39 +/ - 0.16 mum for u87mg cells and 1.91 +/ - 0.19 mum for huvecs .
mscs displayed relative resistance to sfn treatment ( about 40 % cell death at 100 mum ). fig. 1 effect of sfn on cell survival .
u87mg cells , huvecs and mscs were seeded in their standard growth media and were treated with various concentrations of sfn .
cell survival was estimated with the cyquant ( r ) cell proliferation assay kit .
the results obtained for u87mg cells , huvecs or mscs cultured with culture medium alone were considered to correspond to 100 % survival .
data are expressed as the mean of four wells +/ - sem ( n = 3 ) sfn content of sfn - primed mscs and control of their viability we defined the dose of sfn that mscs could carry without deleterious effects on their viability .
for this purpose , mscs ( 4 x 105 ) were incubated for 1 h at 37 degreesc with 20 mum ( 9.2 mug / ml ) or 100 mum ( 46 mug / ml ) .
mscs primed with 20 mum and 100 mum were carrying 8.8 +/ - 0.5 and 52.7 +/ - 5.0 pg sfn per cell , respectively ( fig. 2a ) .
the incubation of mscs with 100 mum sfn resulted in a 40 % loss of cell viability 1 day after uptake , whereas 80 % of mscs remained viable when incubated with 20 mum sfn ( fig. 2b ) .
seven days after priming , no additional loss of viability was observed in either set of conditions and sfn - primed mscs retained their capacity to proliferate ( data not shown ) .
given the lower cell viability observed following the incubation of mscs with 100 mum sfn , we decided to prime mscs with 20 mum sfn. fig. 2 sfn content in primed mscs and control of their viability .
a determination of the sfn content of primed mscs .
mscs were incubated for 1 h at 37 degreesc with sfn ( 20 mum or 100 mum ) .
after washing with hbss , the sfn content of the cell pellet was determined by hplc .
b determination of the viability of sfn - primed mscs .
mscs were incubated for 1 h at 37 degreesc with or without sfn ( 20 mum or 100 mum ) .
after washing with hbss , cells were seeded in a 96 - well plate .
cell survival was estimated after 24 h , with the cyquant ( r ) cell proliferation assay kit .
the results obtained for unprimed mscs were considered to correspond to 100 % survival .
data are expressed as the mean of three independent experiments +/ - sem .
asterisks (*) indicate significant differences from unprimed mscs ( p < 0.05 ) quantification and toxicity of the sfn released by sfn - primed mscs we evaluated the release of sfn over time , by collecting the cm from sfn - primed mscs 4 , 24 , 48 , 72 and 96 h after priming with sfn ( 20 mum ) and analyzing it by lc - ms / ms. we found that about 20 % of the sfn was released from sfn - primed mscs in 4 h , and that 60 % of the drug was released in 48 h ( fig. 3a ) .
no further increase was observed for longer incubation periods .
we therefore estimated that about 40 % of the sfn was retained by the cells .
this result was confirmed in a cytotoxicity assay on u87mg cells and huvecs ( fig. 3b , c ) .
we found that , after 3 days , 6 x 105 sfn - primed mscs , corresponding to the release of approximately 3.2 mug sfn , decreased u87mg cell survival by 23 % , whereas 6 x 105 unprimed mscs had no effect on u87mg cell viability ( fig. 3b ) .
this decrease in survival is intermediate between those induced by 2 mug and 6 mug of sfn ( fig. 3b ) .
a similar result was obtained with huvecs , in which 2 x 105 sfn - primed mscs , corresponding to the release of approximately 1.1 mug sfn , decreased cell survival by 37 % , a value close to that induced by 1.5 mug sfn ( 35 %) ( fig. 3c ). fig. 3 sfn release from sfn - primed mscs and in vitro toxicity of sfn - primed mscs to u87mg cells and huvecs .

two doses of mscs were tested : 6 x 105 and 2 x 105 cells , corresponding to the release of about 3.2 mug and 1.1 mug sfn , respectively .
the results obtained for u87mg cells and huvecs cultured with culture medium alone were considered to correspond to 100 % survival .
data are expressed as the mean of four wells +/ - sem ( n = 2 ) (* p < 0.05 , versus u87mg cells or huvecs cultured with culture medium alone ) analysis of the effects of the intranasal administration of sfn - primed mscs on u87mg growth and angiogenesis we first controlled by fish , the intratumoral distribution of mscs following intranasal administration in u87mg tumor - bearing mice ( d12 , tumor volume : 2.9 +/ - 0.2 mm3 estimated by mri ) ( n = 8 ) ( fig. 4a ) .
three days after intranasal administration of mscs , we observed mscs in the tumor mass and at the border zone between the tumor and the normal parenchyma , consistent with tumor - directed tropism ( fig. 4b ) .
the tumor contained a mean of 157 +/ - 27 cells / mm2 ( fig. 4c ) .
seven days after intranasal administration , the number of mscs in the tumor increased to a mean of 403 +/ - 82 cells / mm2 ( fig. 4c ) .
the mscs were evenly distributed throughout the whole tumor ( data not shown ) .
intranasally administered mscs were also able to migrate towards smaller u87mg tumors ( d6 , tumor volume : 1.2 +/ - 0.1 mm3 estimated by mri ) and this migration was unaffected by priming with sfn ( data not shown ). fig. 4 gb - targeted migration of mscs after intranasal administration .

mscs were administered via the nasal cavity using a pipet tip .
after passing the olfactory epithelium ( brown ) , mscs enter the brain and migrate towards the tumor .
b fluorescence microscopy images of tissue sections after the intranasal injection of mscs into u87mg tumor - bearing mice .
three days ( d15 ) and seven days ( d19 ) after the intranasal administration of mscs , the mscs had migrated and were located within the tumor mass .
mscs were detected by red fluorescent labeling of the y - chromosome .
nuclei were stained with dapi .
scale bars = 100 mum .

results are expressed as the mean number of y + mscs per mm2 +/ - sem (* p < 0.05 , versus the number of y + mscs observed at day 15 ) the effect of two intranasal administrations of sfn - primed mscs was then assessed on u87mg growth and angiogenesis ( fig. 5a ) .
for this purpose , u87mg tumor - bearing mice were treated on day 6 with sfn , or with unprimed or sfn - primed mscs , in amounts corresponding to an sfn dose of about 5.3 mug / mouse .
this dose caused in vitro u87mg cell and huvec mortality rates of close to 40 % and 70 % , respectively .
a control group receiving intranasal administrations of hbss rather than treatment was also established .
this injection protocol was repeated on day 10 .
seven days later , we assessed tumor volume , and the numbers of intratumoral ki67 + proliferative cells and cd31 + vessels .
intranasal administrations of sfn , or of unprimed or sfn - primed mscs had no effect on tumor volume ( fig. 5b ) .
there was no significant difference in the number of intratumoral ki67 + cells between control and treated mice ( fig. 5c , d ) .
nevertheless , mice receiving intranasal administrations of unprimed mscs had slightly higher levels of angiogenesis : they had significantly more small vessels (< 100 mum2 ) than mice receiving intranasal administrations of hbss , sfn or sfn - primed mscs ( fig. 5c , e ) .
this effect was attenuated by the priming of mscs with sfn .
furthermore , sfn - primed mscs induced a significant decrease in the number of large vessels (> 100 mum2 ) relative to hbss , sfn and unprimed mscs ( fig. 5c , e ). fig. 5 effect of intranasal administrations of sfn , or of unprimed or sfn - primed mscs on u87mg growth and angiogenesis .

(* p < 0.05 , versus hbss , sfn and sfn - primed mscs ; * p < 0.05 , versus hbss , sfn and unprimed mscs ) discussion the best approach to chemotherapy for cancer is to deliver the drug to the tumor microenvironment , to kill tumor cells whilst maintaining the lowest possible level of lethal damage to healthy cells , so as to limit deterioration of the patient 's quality of life .
many approaches to achieving this objective have been proposed , including the use of mscs , which can take up drugs and home to tumors when administered systemically in vivo [ 41 ] .
we show here that mscs can be primed in vitro with sfn , a targeted chemotherapy drug .
we showed that a priming concentration of 100 mum sfn caused 40 % toxicity in mscs , whereas a priming concentration of 20 mum was only moderately cytotoxic ( about 20 %) .
this concentration was selected to ensure that a sufficient number of mscs reached the brain tumor after an intranasal delivery .
hplc analysis showed that mscs primed with 20 mum sfn contained a dose of about 9 pg sfn per cell and were able to release 60 % of the drug into the culture medium , in a time - dependent manner .
this result is consistent with the findings of pessina et al .
( 2011 ) [ 34 ] who estimated that about 25 - 30 % of ptx was retained by ptx - primed mscs and never released .
the cytostatic activity of the released sfn was entirely conserved , resulting in the significant inhibition of u87mg cell and huvec proliferation in vitro .
the mechanisms by which mscs excreted sfn did not seem to involve msc death since 80 % of mscs remained viable seven days after priming with sfn .
further work is required to determine the route by which sfn leaves mscs , but recent studies have suggested that mscs deliver drugs by secreting membrane microvesicles [ 42 , 43 ] .
we investigated the in vivo effect of sfn - primed mscs on the orthotopic u87mg gb model , following their intranasal administration .
intranasal delivery has the advantage over direct intracranial deliver of being noninvasive , making repeated treatment regimens possible .
balyasnikova et al .
( 2014 ) [ 19 ] showed , with various technical approaches ( 111in - oxine , mri and bioluminescence imaging ) , that mscs could penetrate the brain from the nasal cavity and infiltrate intracranial glioma xenografts in a mouse model .
we validated their results with another approach , fish technique , which can be used for the specific tracking of male - derived mscs in female nude mice bearing u87mg tumors , through detection of the y - chromosome .
three days after the intranasal administration of 6 x 105 mscs , these cells had accumulated in the u87mg tumor , with a mean of 157 +/ - 27 cells / mm2 , and even greater accumulation was observed after seven days .
these findings are similar to those of reitz et al. , ( 2012 ) [ 44 ] , who reported a mean accumulation of 54 +/ - 13 cells / mm2 in u87mg tumors five days after the intranasal administration of 3 x 105 neural stem / progenitor cells .
the accumulation of mscs in u87mg was analyzed three days post - msc administration to be sure that a sufficient number of cells could be detected by fish but part of mscs might have reached the tumor as early as 24 h as observed by balyasnikova et al .
( 2014 ) [ 19 ] .
these same authors analyzed the distribution of mscs using 111in - oxine - labeled mscs and demonstrated the presence of mscs in the lung and stomach after intranasal delivery .
it is difficult to specify if mscs accumulate in the brain long - term or if they are cleared out from the brain because the survival time of tumor - bearing animals is short .
in our previous study [ 17 ] , we assessed the fate of mscs seven days after being injected into intracranial u87mg tumors and compared it to the fate of mscs injected into the striatum of healthy mice .
mscs did not seem to clear out from the brain .
we observed that 20 % of mscs expressed ki67 proliferation marker in the u87mg environment .
in the healthy environment , we found no mscs in a proliferative state suggesting that factors produced by the u87mg cells induced msc proliferation .
we observed that mscs can migrate towards large or small u87mg tumors .
this is important in a clinical context because gb is highly invasive with an infiltration that can extend several centimeters deep beyond the radiological limits of the tumor [ 45 ] .
furthermore , as previously described for other modified mscs , the priming of mscs with sfn did not prevent their migration after intranasal administration [ 18 , 19 ] .
the treatment of u87mg tumor - bearing mice with two intranasal administrations of 6 x 105 sfn - primed mscs four days apart reduced tumor angiogenesis , resulting in a significant decrease of the number of large vessels .
no decrease in angiogenesis was observed following the intranasal administration of sfn alone , highlighting the potential value of mscs as a vector for transporting sfn to the intracerebral tumor following administration via this route .
we did not observe an effect of sfn - primed mscs on tumor volume or the proportion of ki67 + cells in the tumor .
the absence of this effect is probably due to an insufficient dose of sfn - primed mscs .
siegelin et al .
( 2010 ) [ 8 ] observed that a daily treatment of u87mg - bearing mice with sfn ( 100 mg / kg ) by intraperitoneal injections resulted in an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and reduction of angiogenesis with a prolonged survival of mice .
we injected only two doses of sfn - primed mscs ( about 5.3 mug / mouse ) , a lower dose than was used in the study of siegelin et al. corresponding to about 2 mg / mouse / day .
the dose of sfn carried by mscs in our study corresponded to an effective dose reducing u87mg cell survival in vitro , but was ineffective against u87mg cells in vivo .
however , it may be sufficient to have affected endothelial cells , which are four times more sensitive to sfn than u87mg cells .
the intranasal administration of larger numbers of sfn - primed mscs may be required for an effect on u87mg growth .
however , if we look at global literature data on the use of modified mscs to treat gb , we notice that the effect of these cells on animal survival is relatively modest , whatever the route of administration and the number of administrations .
for example , regarding the intranasal route , balyanikova et al .
( 2014 ) [ 19 ] showed that the treatment of irradiated mice bearing intracranial u87 - egfrviii gb xenografts by four intranasal administrations of 5 x 105 mscs expressing tnf - related apoptosis inducing ligand at one - week intervals prolonged survival of mice of about ten days compared with irradiated mice treated with control mscs .
similarly , mangraviti et al .
( 2016 ) [ 18 ] observed that the treatment of athymic rats bearing human brain tumor - initiating cells by two intranasal inoculations of 2 x 106 human adipose - derived mscs ( hamscs ) producing bone morphogenetic protein 4 one week apart induced a 21.4 % increase in median survival over that in rats treated with control hamscs .
the modest effect of therapeutic mscs on gb growth inhibition may be due to the pro - tumorigenic and pro - angiogenic properties of these cells .
even if the role of mscs in cancer progression remains a matter of heated debate , increasing numbers of studies are highlighting these properties [ 41 , 46 - 48 ] .
in line with these studies , we found that the intranasal administration of unprimed mscs induced a significant increase of the number of small vessels in the u87mg tumor , which was abolished when mscs were primed with sfn .
different studies indicate that mscs promote angiogenesis by secreting angiogenic factors , such as vegf , releasing exosomes , recruiting endothelial progenitors , and / or transdifferentiating into endothelial cells [ 49 , 50 ] .
the mechanisms by which sfn inhibited the angiogenic properties of mscs need to be elucidated .
even though we did not observe an effect of unprimed mscs on tumor volume or the proportion of ki67 + cells in the u87mg tumor , mscs are reported to facilitate tumor growth through their secretion of various anti - inflammatory cytokines and proangiogenic factors [ 41 , 46 - 48 ] .
furthermore , mscs can differentiate into cancer - associated fibroblasts ( cafs ) , which have been described in the stroma of carcinomas and are known to promote tumor growth [ 46 ] .
in the gb peritumoral environment , we identified msc - like cells that we named gb - associated stromal cells ( gascs ) which have phenotypic and functional properties in common with mscs and cafs [ 51 - 53 ] .
like unprimed mscs , their injection into intracranial u87mg tumors had no effect on tumor volume but promoted angiogenesis with an increase in the number of intratumoral small vessels [ 52 ] .
other studies isolated msc - like cells from gb and these cells were shown to increase angiogenesis , and gb cell proliferation and invasion [ 54 - 58 ] .
consistent with these findings , it has been recently observed that the percentage of gb - associated msc - like cells is inversely correlated with overall survival , indicating a role for these cells in promoting the aggressive behavior of gb [ 59 , 60 ] .
all these data raise the question if mscs are interesting candidates as cellular vehicles for the delivery of a therapeutic molecule in a gb context .
even if mscs have the potential to deliver the therapeutic agent in the tumor , their pro - tumorigenic and pro - angiogenic properties may limit the effect of this agent .
we need to find ways of guaranteeing the safety of this cellular vector for clinical use .
one possibility would be to use a suicidal gene or a small molecule to induce senescence in the mscs after drug delivery .
conclusion this study demonstrates the capacity of mscs to carry sfn to gb after their intranasal administration and to decrease angiogenesis .
despite this encouraging result , the anti - angiogenic effect was not enough to affect tumor growth .
the pro - tumorigenic and pro - angiogenic properties of mscs may be responsible for the weakness of the therapeutic effect observed , and the sfn released may not be sufficient to counteract these msc properties .
these findings call into question the suitability of mscs for use in the cell - based delivery of therapeutic agents for gb treatment .

autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease ( adtkd ) is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance , progressive chronic kidney disease , and a bland urinary sediment .
adtkd is most commonly caused by mutations in the umod gene encoding uromodulin ( adtkd - umod ) .
we herein report the first confirmed case of a multi - generational brazilian family with adtkd - umod , caused by a novel heterozygous mutation ( c.163g > a , ggc - - > agc , p.gly55ser ) in the umod gene. of 41 family members , 22 underwent genetic analysis , with 11 individuals found to have this mutation .
three affected individuals underwent hemodialysis , one peritoneal dialysis , and one patient received a kidney transplant from a family member later found to be genetically affected .
several younger individuals affected with the mutation were also identified .
clinical characteristics included a bland urinary sediment in all tested individuals and a kidney biopsy in one individual showing tubulointerstitial fibrosis .
unlike most other reported families with adtkd - umod , neither gout nor hyperuricemia was found in affected individuals .
in summary , we report a novel umod mutation in a brazilian family with 11 affected members , and we discuss the importance of performing genetic testing in families with inherited kidney disease of unknown cause .
chronic kidney disease uromodulin kidney disease genetic mutation uromodulin umod genetic kidney diseases introduction autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is characterized by a bland urinary sediment and progressive chronic kidney disease .
multiple names have been proposed for this group of disorders , including medullary cystic kidney disease , familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy , and uromodulin associated kidney disease .
a recent consensus from a conference for improving global outcomes in kidney disease ( kdigo ) ( 1 ) proposed a new nomenclature for this group of diseases , using the term autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease ( adtkd ) as a collective term , with further nomenclature determined by the underlying genetic mutation .
adtkd - umod is caused by mutations in the umod gene encoding uromodulin .
in addition to kidney disease , adtkd - umod families often suffer from gout and hyperuricemia .
adtkd - ren is caused by mutations in the ren gene encoding renin and is associated with childhood anemia , hyperuricemia , gout , and hyperkalemia ( 2 ) .
adtkd - muc1 is caused by a frameshift mutation in the muc1 gene ; there are no other clinical findings except for progressive chronic kidney disease ( 3 ) .
adtkd is also caused by mutations in the tcf2 gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta ( 4 ) .
in this condition , early onset diabetes , abnormalities in liver function tests , and congenital abnormalities of the genito - urinary tract may occur .
recently , mutations in the sec61a1 gene were also identified as a cause of adtkd ( 5 ) .
patients with this condition may have anemia , developmental delay , and / or leukopenia. of all the subtypes of adtkd , adtkd - umod is the most common ( 6,7 ) .
uromodulin , also known as tamm - horsfall protein , is encoded by the umod gene on chromosome 16p12 ( 8 ) .
it is produced exclusively by tubular cells in the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle and is the most common protein excreted in the urine ( 9 ) .
while its function is not fully understood , it has been found to facilitate transport of the furosemide - sensitive nkcc2 transporter to the apical surface of the thick ascending limb ( 10 ) .
as a result , there is defective sodium transport in the thick ascending limb , resulting in a mild natriuresis .
this natriuresis leads to secondary proximal tubular sodium uptake as well as urate uptake , resulting in hypouricosuric hyperuricemia and gout .
mutations in the umod gene also result in a misfolding of the uromodulin protein , resulting in deposition of the mutant uromodulin in the endoplasmic reticulum ( 11 ) .
some families with umod mutations have a milder clinical course , without hyperuricemia and gout and milder manifestations of chronic kidney disease ( 12,13 ) .
the present study describes a new umod mutation for the first time in a brazilian family presenting with adtkd but without gout or hyperuricemia .
patients and methods the index case was a 62 - year old woman who had suffered from chronic kidney failure of unknown cause for the preceding 5 years .
laboratory studies revealed a serum creatinine of 2.19 mg / dl [ ckd - epi estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr )= 24 ml.min - 1 /( 1.73m2 )] .
the urinalysis revealed no hematuria , with a spot urinary protein : creatinine ratio of 290 mg / g. the serum urate level was 5.0 mg / dl. there was a strong family history of kidney disease , with many affected family members ( see figure 1 ) .

the double arrow indicates the patient who donated a kidney and still had an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) of 66 ml.min - 1 /( 1.73m2 ) at age 59 .
one transverse bar means death by unknown cause whereas two transverse bars mean death in hemodialysis .
black figures indicate end stage renal disease or egfr < 60 ml.min - 1 /( 1.73m2 ) .
gray figures indicate egfr > 60 and < 90 ml.min - 1 /( 1.73m2 ) .
for patients affected clinically , see supplementary table s1 for details .
a plus sign (+) indicates that the patient was genetically tested and found to have the umod mutation .
a negative sign ( - ) means the patient was genetically tested and found not to have a umod mutation .
after a syndromic diagnosis of adtkd was made , we conducted a genetic study in all family members who were willing to participate .
a written consent term was created and approved by the ethical committee of the hospital universitario antonio pedro , universidade federal fluminense .
blood samples were obtained , and the dna was extracted from whole blood using a commercial qiaamp dna kit ( qiagen , germany ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
exon and intron 4 and exon 5 of the umod gene were amplified using the following umod x4 - f primers ( 5 ' - ggtggaggcttgacatcatcagag - 3 ') and umod x5 - r ( 5 ' - ggaatagggctcagatggtctttg - 3 ') , as previously described ( see ref. 14 ) .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) was performed on a thermocycler ( veriti ( r ) 96 - well thermal cycler model , applied biosystems , usa ) under the following conditions : a denaturation cycle at 95degreesc for 5 min , hybridization in 35 cycles of 95degreesc for 30 s , 56degreesc for 30 s , and 68degreesc for 90 s and extension at 68degreesc for 10 min .
the reaction product was purified using the wizard sv gel kit ( promega , usa ) .
sequencing was performed with the bigdye ( r ) terminator cycle sequencing v3.1 kit ( applied biosystems ( tm ) , usa ) and analyzed on the 3130 genetic analyzer sequencer ( applied biosystems , usa ) .
sequencing of the ren gene was performed at the first faculty of medicine , charles university , prague , czech republic , and genetic testing for adtkd - muc1 was performed at the broad institute of harvard medical school and the massachusetts institute of technology , cambridge , ma , usa ( 15 ) .
results the renal ultrasound of the index case revealed small bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys , with some small corticomedullary cysts ( figure 2d ) .
all usual serologic markers including complement proteins , anti - nuclear antibodies , as well as viral serologies were negative .
it was decided to clinically characterize all family members , including a complete medical history , physical examination , laboratory testing , and renal ultrasound. from this data , we determined that the condition was inherited in an autosomal dominant manner .

d , renal ultrasound image showing hyperechogenic kidney with cortical cyst from case iii : 9 .
most of the affected individuals of the family presented with an unexplained decline in glomerular filtration rate .
recurrent urinary tract infections were identified in several female members .
there was no significant proteinuria , hematuria , gout or hyperuricemia .
juvenile diabetes was not present , and blood pressure readings were normal in all individuals .
individual biochemistry data , when available , are reported in supplementary table s1 .
a kidney biopsy performed in one affected family member revealed tubular atrophy , interstitial inflammation , and negative immunostaining for immunoglobulins and complement proteins ( figure 2a - c ) .
in several patients , renal ultrasounds revealed a hyperechogenic cortex and occasional small corticomedullary cysts .
taken together , the clinical presentation of this family was considered characteristic of adtkd .
genetic analysis was performed on 22 individuals , including 3 non - consanguineous spouses who served as controls .
a mutation was not identified in the ren or muc1 gene. of the 22 participants , 11 individuals were found to have a novel c.163g > a , ggc - - > agc , p.gly55ser mutation in exon 4 of the umod gene ( figure 3a ) .
the mutation occurred in exon 4 , a frequent site for umod mutations ( 16 - 18 ) .

all positive patients presented the same mutation .
the cases are iii : 9 , iv : 6 and v : 2 , respectively .

c , structure of the uromodulin protein , showing a leader peptide , three epidermal growth factor egf - like domains , a central domain named d8c , a zp domain and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi - anchoring site ; the black arrow shows the heterozygous missense mutation c.g163a ; p.gly55ser , found in the present study , located in egf1 domain .
below each region are the percentages of mutations reported to date .
the conservation of the mutated amino acid residues was assessed by blastp alignment of human wild - type protein and other mammalian uromodulin homologs ( gorilla gorilla , rattus norvegicus , oryctolagus cuniculus , mus musculus , canis familiaris and bos taurus ) ( figure 3b ) , with the wild - type amino acid being conserved across all species .
a diagram was created showing the domains of the uromodulin protein and the position of the identified mutation ( figure 3c ) .
in order to predict the functional effects of the missense mutation , we used the polyphen 2 program ( polymorphism phenotyping v2 , http :// genetics.bwh.harvard.edu / pph2 /) , the sorting intolerant from tolerant program ( sift , http :// sift.jcvi.org /) , and the m - cap score ( 13 ) .
the polyphen2 core predicted a 40 % likelihood of pathogenicity .
the sift program predicted a 53 % likelihood of pathogenicity .
the m - cap score for p.g55s is 0.617 , indicating the mutation is " possibly pathogenic " .
the lod ( logarithm of odds ) score was calculated as 2.58 , with a recombination frequency of 0.15 .
genetic testing of the muc1 and ren genes was negative .
based on the clinical presentation , the presence of the mutation in all affected individuals , the presence of the mutation in a hotspot for umod mutations , and the negative results from other genetic analysis , the family was diagnosed with adtkd - umod .
after genotyping , further clinical analysis of genetically affected individuals could be performed. of 10 affected individuals in whom laboratory data was available , 6 had advanced chronic kidney disease [ egfr < 60 ml.min - 1 /( 1.73m2 )] , undergone kidney transplantation or started dialysis .
one child ( v : 8 ) had normal renal function and one 28 - year - old ( v : 2 ) had mildly decreased renal function [ egfr 89 ml.min - 1 /( 1.73m2 )] .
there was also a 59 - year - old genetically affected male ( iii : 5 ) who had donated a kidney prior to genetic testing ; his egfr was 66 ml.min - 1 /( 1.73m2 ) .
discussion several previous studies have revealed various heterozygous missense mutations in the umod gene of families with adtkd .
the renal clinical phenotype caused by umod mutation is characterized by dominant inheritance , chronic kidney disease due to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis , hyperuricemia , gout , and , occasionally , renal cysts ( 19 - 21 ) .
more than 100 mutations in the umod gene have been described ; the majority of reported umod mutations cluster in exons 4 (> 80 %) and 5 (> 11 %) , resulting in the replacement of cysteine residues and leading to misfolding of the uromodulin molecule ( 22,23 ) .
in the family under study , serum urate levels were normal , and a number of family members had relatively well - preserved kidney function .
increased awareness of adtkd - umod as a cause of inherited kidney disease , together with increased genetic testing , has revealed a variation in the severity of chronic kidney disease and the presence of gout and hyperuricemia between families .
in one recent study of 202 patients from 74 families , 91 % of tested patients had hyperuricemia ( 24 ) .
however , in a study of a family with an in - frame umod indel ( insertion and deletion ) mutation , only 1 / 30 family members had gout and hyperuricemia ( 12 ) .
thus , gout is not found in all families with adktd - umod .
in the current family , there was a wide variation in age of onset of end - stage kidney disease , with patients starting dialysis at 44 , 56 , and 60 years , while two family members had well preserved kidney function at ages 59 and 62 .
the 62 - year - old patient had actually donated a kidney to a family member and still retained kidney function later in life .
the wide variation of age of esrd has been noted by other investigators , with some affected family members starting dialysis in their 30 's while others had not started dialysis into their late 70 's ( 25 ) .
the cause of this variation in age of onset of esrd is unknown .
recently , bleyer et al. have identified seven cases of genetically affected individuals with adtkd donating a kidney and retaining surprisingly good kidney function over time ( bleyer aj , et al. abstract , american society of nephrology kidney week , 2017 ) .
the reason for milder disease in some individuals remains unexplained .
however , researchers are trying to identify the factors responsible for improved kidney function in some individuals to see if they could point to potential therapies .
adtkd - umod is a rare disease .
the true prevalence is difficult to determine because the condition is frequently underdiagnosed ( 26 ) .
the findings of slowly progressive renal failure , bland urinalyses , and unremarkable renal ultrasounds make the correct diagnosis elusive .
families with adtkd - umod have been reported from europe , usa , asia , and africa ( 6 ) .
a nationwide epidemiologic survey of adtkd - umod conducted in austria revealed a prevalence of 1.7 cases per million population and 1 case per 1000 renal replacement therapy patients ( 27 ) .
medeiros et al .
( 28 ) reported a brazilian family with history of juvenile gout and chronic kidney disease and made a clinical diagnosis of familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy ; a mutational analysis of the umod gene was not performed .
at present , there is no specific therapy for adtkd - umod .
allopurinol is very effective as a treatment of hyperuricemia and gout in these patients , but it is unclear if it has an effect on progression of chronic kidney disease ( 29 - 31 ) .
even though there is no specific therapy for adtkd - umod , there are several reasons to perform genetic testing .
first , definitive diagnosis is very important for many family members and their doctors .
a correct diagnosis will prevent unnecessary testing and avoid unneeded kidney biopsies .
second , genetic testing can then be performed to confirm the presence or absence of disease in other family members .
genetic counselling can also be provided .
correct identification will also allow a better characterization of this condition over time .
finally , when a treatment does become available , family members will have already been identified and can be notified .
even though there was a successful donation in a genetically affected donor , we still believe that all family members who are potential donors should be tested for the familial mutation and very great caution be exercised when considering them for donation .
in summary , we have identified a multi - generational family in brazil in which a mutation in the umod gene is linked to adtkd .
the family had a less severe presentation compared to other families , with several family members being mildly affected , and with the absence of hyperuricemia and gout .
nephrologists should consider umod mutational analysis in families with adtkd and a bland urinary sediment , even when hyperuricemia and gout are not present .

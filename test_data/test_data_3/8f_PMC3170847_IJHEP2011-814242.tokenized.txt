ophthalmologic complications with interferon therapy are rare and usually reversible .
the anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is an uncommon complication of interferon treatment .
a case of irreversible anterior ischemic optic neuropathy complicating interferon therapy for chronic hepatitis c is reported .
we suggest that periodic ophthalmological examinations , including visual acuity and fundus examinations , should be performed to patients with high risk of ocular complications after starting and during treatment .
we also suggest that an ophthalmologist would be able to detect these complications .
antiviral treatment should be stopped immediately if severe ophthalmologic complications occur .
ophthalmologic complications with interferon therapy are rare , usually mild and reversible , and do not require the withdrawal of antiviral treatment [ 1 ] .
ophthalmologic complications with interferon alpha therapy , such as retinopathy with cotton - wool spots , hemorrhages and macular edema , optic neuropathy , and thrombotic microangiopathy occur in less than 1 % of treated patients .
individuals with diabetes , hypertension , dislipidemia , and hypercoagulable states are more prone to develop those changes .
in most cases , they are subclinical , mild , and reversible , not requiring the withdrawal of the treatment [ 2 ] .
we report a case of a patient with chronic hepatitis c who developed irreversible anterior ischemic optic neuropathy during antiviral treatment by pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin .
a 55 - year - old man had chronic hepatitis c since 2008 .
hcv genotype was 4 , hcv - rna level was 6,08.106 equivalent / ml and the histological score of the liver biopsy was a2 f3 according to the metavir classification .
pegylated interferon ( 180 mug / week ) combined with ribavirin ( 1000 mg / day ) was started in june 2008 .
hcv - rna had been undetectable since week 12 of the therapy .
five months after starting treatment , the patient presented with a sudden bilateral decreased vision .
visual acuity was 2 / 10 in the left eye and 4 / 10 in the right eye , while his visual acuity was previously normal .
fundus examination revealed bilateral disc edema .
fluorescein angiography confirmed the bilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy .
there was no response to the visual evoked potentials in the either eye .
the complete blood count chemistry , sedimentation rate , c - reactive protein level , antinuclear antibodies , anti - dna antibodies , and panca antibodies were normal .
cryoglobulinemia was negative as were magnetic resonance imaging of the head , echocardiogram , and carotid doppler study .
antiviral treatment was discontinued , and the patient received methyl prednisolone 1 g for 5 days .
an ophthalmologic examination one month later showed that visual acuity had not clearly improved the visual acuity was 3 / 10 for the left eye and 5 / 10 for the right one , while optic disc oedema was partially resolved .
hcv - rna was always undetectable six months and 1 year after interruption of treatment , suggesting a sustained virological response .
ophthalmologic examination after 1 years showed a visual acuity of 3 / 10 for the left eye and 5 / 10 for the right one .
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is an uncommon complication of interferon treatment which may dramatically impair visual function .
few cases have been reported in the literature [ 3 ] during antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis c [ 2 ] and also during interferon treatment of cancer ( 2 cases ) , treatment of primary thrombocytemia ( 1 case ) , treatment of malignant melanoma ( 1 case ) , and during treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 4 ] .
predisposing factors have not been clearly identified , except for classic vascular risk factors ( diabetes , arterial hypertension , and dyslipidemia ) [ 2 ] .
in our patient 's case , no vascular risk factors were found .
purvin and col [ 5 ] has suggested involvement of the posterior ciliary arterius rather than the retinal vessels as a possible cause of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy [ 5 ] .
lohmann and coll hypothesized that interferon could produce autoantibodies , and thus cause desposition of immune complexes in the small retinal or optic cytokines causing an inflammatory reaction of the blood vessels that could then lead to ischemia [ 6 ] .
the favorable course is uncommon in anterior ischemic optic neuropathy with vascular causes suggesting another mechanism [ 4 ] .
the absence of resolution of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy after discontinuation of interferon in our patient suggests probable vascular causes .
in the literature , the course of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy occurring during interferon treatment for chronic hepatitis c was favorable in four cases [ 7 ] , and not resolved in three cases [ 2 , 4 ] .
after interruption of the antiviral treatment , our patient received methyl prednisolone , a steroid drug prescribed by the ophthalmologists , without favorable course of visual function .
in the literature , two patients received steroids after interferon treatment was discontinued , but there was no improvement in visual function [ 3 ] .
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is uncommon unpredictable , and the frequency is unknown with interferon therapy .
periodic ophthalmologic examinations before starting treatment and during treatment particularly in patients with vascular risk factors must be indicated .
therapy should be stopped immediately if severe ophthalmologic complications occur .

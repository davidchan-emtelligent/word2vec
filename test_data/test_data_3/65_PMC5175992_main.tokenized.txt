current prostate cancer ( pca ) diagnostic tests suffer from insufficient sensitivity and specificity .
novel biomarkers that can be detected by minimally invasive methods are of a particular value .
here we provide two datasets .
the first one is on the whole transcriptome profiling by rna - seq of urine and plasma obtained from patients with pca and benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) .
the second one represents targeted sequencing of dna from urine and plasma of patients with pca and bph .
both datasets are available at ncbi sequence read archive under accession no .
srp093707 and no .
srp093842 respectively .

value of the data * the data on protein coding and non - coding rnas detectable in urine and plasma of patients with pca is valuable for the screening of novel biomarkers for early diagnostics of pca .
* targeted dna sequencing data can be used to develop methods of revealing resistance to commonly used anti - androgen therapy at the early stages of pca progression .
* both datasets include samples obtained from patients with bph which can be used as a control group to ensure high specificity of found markers towards pca ( nikitina et al. , 2016 ) [ 1 ] .
* access to the raw sequencing data allows researchers to perform further bioinformatic analysis based on their own computational algorithms .
1 experimental design , materials and methods 1.1 sample collection , rna and dna extraction urine and plasma samples were taken from 14 patients with pca and 3 patients with bph from moscow city clinical hospital no .
50. urine samples were obtained after prostate massage .
each urine and plasma sample was collected either before or after the operation ( radical prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate ( turp ) depending on patient 's diagnosis ) .
rna and dna extractions from urine were performed using rna / dna purification kit ( norgen biotek ) .
isolation of these molecules from plasma was carried out by qiaamp circulating nucleic acid kit ( qiagen ) .
overall , 19 rna ( 12 from urine and 7 from plasma ) samples and 41 dna ( 14 from urine and 27 from plasma ) samples were obtained .
table 1 provides information about patients and the samples obtained from them .
each sample name corresponds to a single library and to a single fastq record in ncbi sra database .
1.2 transcriptome library preparation dna contaminations from extracted total rna were removed with the use of dnase i ( fermentas ) treatment following the manufacturer 's recommendations .
rna concentration was determined by fluorometer qubit 2.0 using qubit rna hs assay kit ( thermo fisher ) .
transcriptomic libraries were constructed using ion total rna - seq kit v2 ( life technologies ) with the following modifications of the protocol .
for rna fragmentation 1 microl of 10x rnase iii buffer ( life technologies ) was added to 9 microl of rna solution and heated for 10 min at 95 degreesc followed by immediate snap - cooling on ice .
after that 1 microl of 10 microm atp and 1 microl of polynucleotide kinase ( fermentas ) were added to the solution from the previous step and the whole mix was incubated at 37 degreesc for 30 min .
fragmented rna was cleaned up using micro bio - spin chromatography columns ( bio - rad ) .
further steps of library preparation including adapter ligation , first - strand cdna synthesis , and amplification were carried out in accordance with manufacturer 's instructions .
fragments of cdna corresponding to rrna were depleted using duplex - specific nuclease ( evrogen ) as described in [ 2 ] with the following modifications .
only one round of dsn - normalisation was performed and the re - annealing of ds - cdna at 68 degreesc was carried out overnight .
the prepared library was purified by magnetic beads agencourt ampure xp ( beckman coulter inc. ) and its quality was assessed by 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent genomics ) using agilent high sensitivity dna kit ( agilent genomics ) .
1.3 targeted dna library preparation generead dnaseq targeted human prostate cancer panel ( qiagen ) was used for targeted enrichment of the extracted dna .
considering the quality of circulating cell - free dna the number of cycles in this amplification step was raised to 20 and 22 for dna extracted from urine and plasma respectively .
subsequent library construction was performed using generead library prep workflow ( qiagen ) following the manufacturer 's recommendations .
1.4 high - throughput sequencing the sequencing of constructed libraries was performed on ion proton platform using ion pi hi - q sequencing 200 kit and ion pi chip kit v2 ( thermo fisher scientific ) following the recommendations of the manufacturer .
base calling was performed by torrent suite 5.0 , fastqcreator v3.4.56313 .

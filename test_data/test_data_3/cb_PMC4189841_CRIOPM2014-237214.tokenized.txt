self - enucleation is a very unusual form of self - mutilation directly linked to mental illness .
in this case we present a 26 - year - old schizophrenic patient who attempted to enucleate his eye with a rollerball pen .
antipsychotic therapy and emergency surgery saved the patient eye and emphasize the importance of quick response and good collaboration between psychiatric and ophthalmic teams .
1. introduction self - enucleation , or " oedipism ," is a rare but devastating condition , often the result of acute psychosis .
this condition poses a challenge to both psychiatric and ophthalmologic personnel .
in the past , it was believed to be caused by either inappropriate sexual attraction to one 's mother ( freud 's famous oedipus complex ) or by christian guilt after reflection on a certain passage from the gospel of matthew [ 1 ] .
now it is believed to result from acute schizophrenic psychosis , drug induced psychosis , obsessive - compulsive disorder , depression , or mental retardation [ 2 , 3 ] .
estimated prevalence is reportedly between 2.8 and 4.2 : 100,000 and incidence is about 1 : 30 million people per year in an equal male to female ratio [ 2 , 4 ] .
the instrument of self - enucleation may be a finger , sharp object , or very often a usual item such as a signet ring [ 5 ] .
here , we present a case of a schizophrenic patient who attempted to enucleate his right eye using a rollerball pen .
2. case report a 26 - year - old male , diagnosed with schizophrenia six years earlier , was admitted to the abarbanel mental health center , israel , during an acute psychotic event .
while being admitted , the patient deliberately injured his right eye with a ballpoint pen .
a quick response from the medical staff prevented him from self - enucleating and he was transferred to our er for ophthalmologic evaluation .
a bag containing a broken pen with a missing tip accompanied him .
the patient was catatonic and noncooperative , so no history could be obtained .
after administering zyprexa 10 mg and clonex 1 mg , we were able to examine the patient .
on examination the best corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) in his right eye was 20 / 150 and intraocular pressure ( iop ) was 20 mmhg .
the patient had right periorbital edema and ecchymosis , severe conjunctival chemosis , corneal erosions , and a clean anterior chamber .
the pupil was dilated with no direct or consensual response to light .
the vitreous was clear and fundoscopy showed a completely normal disc and retina .
in addition , the patient had positive right relative afferent papillary defect ( rapd ) and a complete ophthalmoplegia of the right eye .
examination of the left eye was normal , with visual acuity of 20 / 20 and iop of 14 mmhg .
on orbital ct there was no sign of perforation .
it did show , however , a metallic foreign body in the right orbital apex close to the optic nerve and adjacent to the superior orbital fissure ( figure 1 ) .
because the patient displayed signs of traumatic orbital apex syndrome , we planned an urgent surgery to remove the foreign body .
however , it was clear that the patient , suffering from acute psychosis , is unable to give an informed consent .
therefore , the decision to operate was made and the signatures of three physicians were obtained , as dictated by the israeli patient 's rights law [ 6 ] .
intravenous cefazolin and parenteral cotrimoxazole were administered to protect against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria .
a lateral orbitotomy through the superior lid crease incision was performed .
a 1.2 - centimeter long metallic pen tip was located and retrieved from the apex ( figure 2 ) .
after removing the object , drain was left and the orbit was repaired .
the following week , there was no sign of infection and the patient was discharged with bcva of 20 / 60 , a dilated pupil slightly reactive to light , and complete ophthalmoplegia .
sixty - six days after surgery the visual acuity had improved to 20 / 20 .
the patient had slight ptosis , slight restriction in re adduction with diplopia , and a pupil responsive to accommodation but only slightly responsive to light , with no rapd ( figure 3 ) .
the patient 's eye exam during his follow - up period is described in table 1 .
3. discussion approximately eighty case reports on this rare condition exist in medical literature .
patton 's 2004 review suggests several causative psychological factors [ 1 ] .
in about half of the cases , religious ideation was at the root of the psychosis ; the patient , preoccupied with sinful thoughts , would attack his own eye , as it symbolises the soul .
sexual ideation was found to be a cause in one - third of the cases .
some theories suggest that the act mimics autocastration and that the eye represents the penis .
others suggest that self - enucleation results from an oedipus complex or repressed homosexuality or that it might be an autoerotic act similar to masturbation .
regardless of the psychological origin of the self - enucleation , all of the patients who attempt it suffer from acute psychosis , often resulting from untreated schizophrenia , and have bizarre delusions about their eyes [ 2 ] .
until such severe psychosis can be brought under control using antipsychotic drugs , the patient should be restrained to keep him from hurting himself .
at presentation the patient exhibited traumatic optic neuropathy and complete ophthalmoplegia with pupillary involvement .
in this case of penetrating trauma , direct damage to the cranial nerves and ocular muscles caused this orbital apex syndrome .
other complications described in reports on self - enucleation include damage to the ophthalmic artery , aneurysm of internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries , endophthalmitis , meningitis , and subarachnoid hemorrhage [ 1 ] .
our patient had a light near - dissociation response , most probably due to trauma to the ciliary ganglion , a parasympathetic ganglion located between the optic nerve and lateral rectus .
because 93 % of the postciliary ganglion axons innervate the ciliary body for accommodation and only 7 % innervate the iris for miosis during light reflex , pupil response to accommodation is usually spared after such injuries .
this case emphasizes the importance of collaboration between psychiatric and ophthalmic teams in order to preserve a patient 's vision after a self - enucleation attempt .

figure 3 this photo was taken several seconds after testing for near accommodation .
the right pupil had a normal constriction phase but later demonstrated a slower dilation response then the left pupil .
this anisocoria is a result of a right tonic pupil due to ciliary ganglion injury .

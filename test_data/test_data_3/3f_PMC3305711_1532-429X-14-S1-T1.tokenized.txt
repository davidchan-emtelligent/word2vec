background standard mri assessment of ventricular volume and mass is based on a stack of " standard " short axis images orthogonal to the lv horizontal long axis .
recently , we showed a modified short axis ( sa ) geometry more accurately defines the tricuspid valve plane , and thereby provides more reliable right ventricular volume estimates in normal subjects and repaired tof patients .
in order to use the modified sa stack as a replacement for the standard sa stack in routine studies , we wanted to prove its reliability for lv measurements .
methods the study was a comparison of cardiac mri scans of 15 patients ( 10 male , age range 10 to 25 years ) with tof status post transannular patch repair .
subjects underwent cardiac mri for standard clinical indications .
in addition to standard sa cine ssfp stacks ( fig.1 ) ; a second stack of " modified " sa ssfp cines was obtained perpendicular to the rv outflow long axis ( fig.1 ) .
lv volumetry and mass were assessed by planimetry of the endocardial and epicardial lv borders at end - systole and end - diastole using medis qmass software .
lv volume and mass were measured for both sets of sa stacks ( figs.2 - 2 ) by 2 independent expert blinded observers at separate sittings .
agreement between the modified and standard geometry measures was determined by the intraclass correlation coefficients ( icc ) and bland - altman analysis .
although there are no universal standards , values of icc of < 0.40 are considered low and values of > 0.75 are considered high .
figure 1 figure 2 results there was excellent agreement for all left ventricular metrics between the standard and the modified sa geometries .
the icc for the two methods was 0.93 ( p < 0.001 ) for end - diastolic volume , 0.91 ( p < 0.001 ) for end - systolic volume , and 0.91 ( p < 0.001 ) for lv mass .
the bland - altman analysis showed no significant bias with limits of agreement < 5 % ( fig.1 ( 5 )) .
there was also excellent interobserver agreement for the modified short axis geometry with iccs ranging from 0.91 to 0.95 for the three measures and bland - altman limits of agreement < 7 % .
conclusions the modified sa geometry showed excellent agreement of lv volume measurments compared with the standard sa geometry in this series of chronic rv volume overload patients .
these results combined with our previous work showing improved rv assessment by the modified sa geometry makes this the preferred geometry for standard evaluation of repaired tof patients .
abstract summary statement in patients with chronic rv volume overload , a modified short axis geometry that has shown better reliability for rv volumetry also demonstrates excellent agreement for lv volumetry compared with the standard sa geometry .

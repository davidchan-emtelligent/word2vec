ovarian - type surface epithelial neoplasms of the testis and paratestis are uncommon , and the mucinous subtype is particularly rare .
these tumors represent a counterpart to ovarian cancer .
malignant tumors have the potential for metastatic spread and are often fatal .
the case of a 59 - year - old man with testicular mucinous adenocarcinoma is presented .
computed tomography indicated involvement of the paraaortic and pelvic lymph nodes , so chemotherapy was initiated .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the second paper regarding responsiveness to chemotherapies used in ovarian cancer .
1. introduction primary ovarian - type surface epithelial carcinomas of the testis and paratestis are very rare [ 1 ] .
the mucinous subtype is particularly rare , with only 20 cases reported to date [ 2 - 6 ] .
we report a case of primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the testis with retroperitoneal metastasis .
we discuss the management of this uncommon testicular tumor based on the limited reports .
2. case report a 59 - year - old man with hyperlipidemia presented with a 2 - month history of right testicular discomfort and painless swelling .
physical examination revealed a firm mass with an irregular surface in the right scrotum .
no lymphadenopathy was palpable .
laboratory findings showed elevation of serum carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 ( ca19 - 9 ) to 17,200 u / ml ( normal , < 37 u / ml ) and carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) to 6.5 ng / ml ( normal , < 5 ng / ml ) , although levels were normal for serum germ cell tumor markers such as lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) , beta - human chorionic gonadotropin ( beta - hcg ) , and alpha - fetoprotein ( afp ) .
transscrotal ultrasonography showed a 6 x 4 x 2 cm mass with cyst in the right testis .
abdominal computed tomography ( ct ) revealed swelling of the paraaortic and pelvic lymph nodes to a diameter of 2.5 cm ( figure 1 ) .
chest radiography showed no normal abnormalities .
no gastrointestinal tumor was indicated on upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy .
right primary testicular tumor was diagnosed and the patient underwent right inguinal orchiectomy .
pathological examination demonstrated that the tumor consisted of solid tumor containing mucinous fluid .
microscopically , a single or several layers of columnar epithelium producing mucin showed papillary growth .
the tumor epithelium exhibited stromal invasion ( figure 2 ) .
no teratomatous element , germ cell neoplasia , or ovarian - type stroma was evident .
after orchiectomy , serum ca19 - 9 fell to 6,860 u / ml. adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated to treat paraaortic lymph node metastasis using paclitaxel ( 185 mg / m2 ) and carboplatin ( auc 6 ) administered every 3 weeks for a total of three cycles .
after the first treatment , the level of ca19 - 9 halved but subsequently increased to 10,270 u / ml for the next two cycles .
multiple lung and liver metastases were identified on ct at this time .
these findings suggested that the tumor had developed resistance to the first regimen .
the patient decided against further treatment and died 10 months later .
3. discussion primary ovarian - type surface epithelial carcinomas of the testis and paratestis are rare [ 1 ] .
six subtypes have been defined : serous , mucinous , endometrioid , clear , transitional , and squamous .
the most frequent of these is the serous subtype , while the mucinous subtype is very rare .
to the best of our knowledge , only 20 cases ( including the present case ) have been reported to date [ 2 - 6 ] .
the incidence of these tumors is higher among older age groups than that of common testicular tumors , with a median age at onset of 54 years [ 2 - 6 ] .
similar to ovarian tumors , the biological behavior ranges from benign to borderline to malignant with metastasis .
although the gross features resemble the well - known ovarian tumors , a few differences are worth noting .
testicular tumors are not generally as large as the ovarian ones , as the more conspicuous location results in patients seeking attention earlier .
as a result , the chief complaint is commonly painless enlargement of the testis , sometimes with a hydrocele .
compared to an ovarian tumor , a testicular tumor is more often a unilocular cystic tumor .
the most important differential diagnosis is metastasis from the gastrointestinal tract for primary ovarian - type surface epithelial carcinomas of the testis .
in cases with ovarian tumors , immunostaining for cytokeratin 7 , muc2 , muc5ac , and muc6 has been reported to be useful in distinguishing this from metastatic ovarian tumors .
also , with intratesticular mucinous adenocarcinoma , some reports have suggested the utility of immunohistochemical staining [ 2 ] .
however , solid evidence is lacking , because of unavailable material .
the possibility of metastatic lesions from primary tumors of other primary sites should thus be excluded by appropriate clinical , endoscopic , and radiographic investigations .
the standard treatment for localized disease is radical orchiectomy .
the significance of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial , as most reported cases have not shown metastases and have enjoyed a good prognosis .
our case displayed a metastasis at the time of first diagnosis of testicular tumor , and the tumor behaved in a positively malignant manner .
we selected paclitaxel and carboplatin administered every 3 weeks as adjuvant chemotherapy , as used for first - line chemotherapy in ovarian cancer [ 7 ] .
the tumor was initially sensitive to this regimen but became resistant after 3 cycles .
the second - line agent for relapsed ovarian cancer is liposomal doxorubicin or gemcitabine .
the patient desired palliative care and died 10 months after ending chemotherapy .
in conclusion , our case showed two important points .
the first point is that we should take into consideration that this type of tumor might have malignant potential , although most previous reports have shown the features of a favorable clinical outcome .
second , experience is limited with intratesticular mucinous adenocarcinoma .
however , its behavior appears similar to that of its ovarian counterparts .
chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin might have potential efficacy , as previously reported .

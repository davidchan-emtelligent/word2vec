both bts and sign guidelines recognise that simple nodal sampling is not adequate to accurately stage nsclc and recommend at least systematic sampling of mediastinal nodes .
in the west of scotland all patients with node positive disease are considered for adjuvant chemotherapy .
this requires accurate staging of lymph nodes .
aims / objectives we report on the nodal staging of all patients in 2012 and 2013 who underwent lung resection .
method all patients who underwent surgery for nsclc at the golden jubilee national hospital in 2012 and 2013 were included .
data were collected on histological diagnosis , t and n staging from histology reports , the lymph nodes stations sampled at operation and the operating surgeon .
adequate lymph node sampling was considered to have been performed if more than three mediastinal lymph node stations were sampled , as this is a quality performance indicator set out by nhs scotland .
results 583 patients underwent lung resection .
there was no difference in the proportion of patients with nodal disease between operating consultant ( p = 0.120 ) .
in this cohort , as the number of lymph node stations sampled increased , the proportion of node positive disease increased from 16 % and 19 % if only 1 or 2 lymph node stations were sampled respectively , to 42 % node positive if more than 6 stations were sampled ( p = 0.002 ) .
when 3 or more mediastinal lymph node stations were sampled , then the detection of nodal disease increased by 50 % ( p = 0.006 ) .
discussion / conclusion by sampling more mediastinal lymph nodes , more diseased lymph nodes were detected .
this meant these patients were more accurately staged and considered for adjuvant chemotherapy , therefore potentially increasing their chances of survival .

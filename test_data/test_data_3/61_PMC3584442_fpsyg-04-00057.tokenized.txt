the purpose of this study was to explore developmental changes , in terms of spectral fluctuations and temporal periodicity with japanese - and english - learning infants .
three age groups ( 15 , 20 , and 24 months ) were selected , because infants diversify phonetic inventories with age .
natural speech of the infants was recorded .
we utilized a critical - band - filter bank , which simulated the frequency resolution in adults' auditory periphery .
first , the correlations between the power fluctuations of the critical - band outputs represented by factor analysis were observed in order to see how the critical bands should be connected to each other , if a listener is to differentiate sounds in infants' speech .
in the following analysis , we analyzed the temporal fluctuations of factor scores by calculating autocorrelations .
the present analysis identified three factors as had been observed in adult speech at 24 months of age in both linguistic environments .
these three factors were shifted to a higher frequency range corresponding to the smaller vocal tract size of the infants .
the results suggest that the vocal tract structures of the infants had developed to become adult - like configuration by 24 months of age in both language environments .
the amount of utterances with periodic nature of shorter time increased with age in both environments .
this trend was clearer in the japanese environment .
infant vocalization speech development spectral fluctuations factor analysis speech rhythm introduction during the first 2 years of age , the human speech production mechanism develops rapidly .
various anatomic structures of the vocal tract grow to 55 - 80 % of adult size by 18 months of age ( vorperian et al. , 2005 ) .
corresponding to the growth of the vocal tract as well as the control of places and manners of articulation , infant vocalization changes from cooing ( vowel - like sounds ) to babbling ( e.g. , da - da or ma - ma ) , and then to words similar to adult speech during the first 2 years of life .
a number of studies have explored the acoustic characteristics in infant speech spectra , such as formants or spectral peaks of vowels ( e.g. , buhr , 1980 ; lieberman , 1980 ; bond et al. , 1982 ; kent and murray , 1982 ; gilbert et al. , 1997 ; rvachew et al. , 2006 ; ishizuka et al. , 2007 ) ; these acoustic characteristics reflect the development of the vocal tract and the acquisition of places and manners of articulation .
for example , gilbert et al .
( 1997 ) explored developmental characteristics of formant 1 ( f1 ) and formant 2 ( f2 ) produced by four young english - learning children between 15 and 36 months of age .
the results revealed that f1 and f2 were relatively stable during the period of 15 - 21 months and their frequencies decreased significantly between 24 and 36 months .
gilbert et al .
( 1997 ) suggested that the vocal tract length and pharyngeal space increased whereas nasal cavity influence decreased , which would probably result in relatively stable f1 and f2 during the period of 15 - 21 months .
bond et al .
( 1982 ) analyzed f1 and f2 of english front and back vowels between 17 and 29 months , and showed that vowel formants shifted in accordance with vowel space expansion with age .
ishizuka et al .
( 2007 ) also explored longitudinal developmental changes ( 4 - 60 months of age ) in spectral peaks of vowels with two japanese - learning infants .
the results showed that a categorically separated vowel space is formed by around 20 months of age , and that the speed of vowel space expansions is rapid by around 24 months of age .
these studies supported the view that there are rapid developmental changes in acoustic characteristics during the first 2 years of age corresponding to anatomical development of the vocal tract and manners and places of articulation .
in addition to the acoustic characteristics in infant speech , increasing attention has been devoted to temporal periodicity ( e.g. , oller , 1986 ; davis and macneilage , 1995 ; davis et al. , 2000 ; kouno , 2001 ; nathani et al. , 2003 ; petitto et al. , 2004 ; dolata et al. , 2008 ) .
this interest has been caused by the statement that consonant - vowel ( cv ) sequences in babblings are simply determined by open - close mandibular oscillation , which gives listeners the perceptual impression of temporal regularity ( e.g. , davis and macneilage , 1995 ; oller , 2000 ) .
dolata et al .
( 2008 ) explored the repetition of cv forms in reduplicative vocal babblings obtained from english - learning infants ( 7 - 16 months of age ) and reduplicated syllables from adult speakers .
the results showed that the mean syllable duration in vocal babblings was 329.5 ms and 95 % of total durations were between 250 and 425 ms. for adult speakers , the mean syllable duration was 189 ms , which was shorter than that of infant utterances .
nathani et al .
( 2003 ) investigated normally hearing and deaf infants at prelinguistic vocal development .
for normally hearing infants , the mean nonfinal syllable durations decreased from 378 to 316 ms , and final syllable durations decreased from 527 to 355 ms. final syllable length ratios for normally hearing infants decreased across age whereas it was relatively stable for deaf infants .
the results suggested that the rhythmic organization was influenced by the auditory status and the level of vocal development .
kouno ( 2001 ) reported that syllable duration of two - or three - syllable words gradually decreased to be less than 420 ms in babbling forms and less than 330 ms in word forms in japanese - learning infants by around 20 months of age .
both studies ( kouno , 2001 ; nathani et al. , 2003 ) showed gradual development in that the syllable duration in infant vocalizations became shorter across age .
some studies attempted to find language - related aspects of temporal periodicity in early word production period .
a representative series of vihman ( 1991 , vihman et al .
1998 , 2006 ) , vihman and de boysson - bardies ( 1994 ) explored speech rhythm in infant production from different language backgrounds .
for example , halle et al .
( 1991 ) investigated duration patterns in disyllabic vocalization in either word or babbling forms with japanese - and french - learning infants by around 18 months of age .
final syllable lengthening , which reflected duration characteristics in french , was found in french - learning infants , whereas it was absent for japanese - learning infants : language - related aspects of prosodic patterns were already found in infant utterances in these linguistic environments .
vihman et al .
( 1998 ) examined disyllables obtained from english - and french - learning infants in the late single - word period ( 13 - 20 months of age ) .
the tendency that the second vowel duration was longer than the first vowel duration was adult - like in french - learning infants , whereas each syllable was at considerably higher level of variability , which less closely matched to prosodic patterns in adult speech , in english - learning infants .
there was also individual variability for english - learning infants .
vihman et al .
( 1998 ) considered children 's differing learning strategies , and argued that each child filtered the input of language , and attempted to reproduce words based on their favored word production templates .
language - related aspects were found while there was variability of syllable duration in the early word production period .
although these studies shed light on the developmental changes in acoustic characteristics and temporal periodicity , they had the following problems : ( 1 ) formant frequency analysis ( e.g. , buhr , 1980 ; lieberman , 1980 ; bond et al. , 1982 ; kent and murray , 1982 ; gilbert et al. , 1997 ; ishizuka et al. , 2007 ) , which was most frequently used , is employed basically to detect only vowel sounds in order to obtain knowledge for linguistic development .
there has been a lack of acoustic analysis which measures the whole pattern of spectral fluctuations .
( 2 ) speech samples to observe temporal periodicity were limited to disyllabic vocalizations ( e.g. , halle et al. , 1991 ; vihman et al. , 1998 ; davis et al. , 2000 ) .
there was no automatic measurement to identify temporal periodicity , and thus phoneticians judged duration by looking at speech waveforms , which might have be subjective .
in the present study , a critical - band - filter bank was used to analyze the spectral fluctuations and temporal periodicity in infants' utterances .
a practical way to analyze speech signals is to separate them into a certain number of narrow frequency bands as in a historical ( traditional ) vocoder system , and to observe the temporal power fluctuation in each frequency band .
the notion of critical bands , which reflects basic characteristics of the auditory system ( see , e.g. , fletcher , 1940 ; zwicker and terhardt , 1980 ; patterson and moore , 1986 ; unoki et al. , 2006 ; fastl and zwicker , 2007 ; moore , 2012 ) , seemed convenient for our present purpose , because the power fluctuations in 15 - 22 critical bands contain enough information to make speech almost fully intelligible .
ueda and nakajima ( 2008 ) performed factor analyses of the spectral fluctuations in speech sounds of different languages , utilizing a critical - band - filter bank .
the same three factors appeared in japanese and english , which were replicated for a far smaller number of speech samples ( see figure a1 in appendix ) .
the critical - band - filter bank analysis seemed applicable to japanese - and english - learning infant speech in order to detect the whole pattern of spectral fluctuations .
we were particularly interested in what age of life the factors as in adults' speech would appear in infant speech .
as a next step , we explored the temporal periodicity in infant speech obtained from japanese - and english - learning infants .
the speech samples in the current study were not limited to disyllabic vocalization .
we used all the speech samples (>= 1.5 s ) in order to explore the whole pattern of developmental changes .
we utilized the temporal periodicity of the factor scores that summarizes power fluctuations of speech sounds in the outputs of critical - band filters , instead of measuring temporal intervals in speech waveforms by the eye .
japanese and english adult speech samples in a database were first analyzed , and the validity of this method was proved ( see figure a2 in appendix ) .
thus , we applied this method to identify the temporal periodicity in infant speech .
three ages , 15 , 20 , and 24 months , were selected for the following reasons .
the various vocal tract structures , predominantly pharyngeal / posterior structure , achieve 55 - 80 % of the adult size by 18 months of age ( vorperian et al. , 2005 ) .
in addition to the development of vocal tract , lexical development is in rapid progress from 12 to 18 months of age .
many infants over this period become capable of producing at least 50 meaningful words , which is so called " 50 - word stage " ( macneilage et al. , 2000 ) .
after " 50 - word stage ," there is an explosion of phonetic diversification due to the better control of manners and places of articulations to produce a variety of consonant sounds , and expansion of the vowel spaces to include diverse vowel types ( kern et al. , 2010 ) .
thus , around the age of 15 months , the vocal tract is in the process of rapid development and this corresponds to a period of rapid lexical development ( 12 - 18 months ) , while infants from 20 to 24 months of age become capable of diversifying phonetic inventories and form some sentences to convey more complex messages .
thus , the period of 15 - 24 months of age seemed appropriate to explore significant changes in infant speech development .
the questions of infant speech development were addressed as follows : ( 1 ) how do spectral fluctuation and temporal periodicity in infant speech change between 15 and 24 months of age ?
( 2 ) are the developmental changes of speech in the acoustic domain similar in japanese - and english - learning infants ?
materials and methods infant participants participants included five typically developing infants at 15 months of age ( three girls and two boys ) , five infants at 20 months of age ( three girls and two boys ) , and five infants at 24 months of age ( three girls and two boys ) from japanese - speaking families .
five typically developing infants at 15 months of age ( three girls and two boys ) , five infants at 20 months of age ( two girls and three boys ) , and four infants at 24 months of age ( three girls and one boy ) were from english - speaking families .
the japanese - learning infants were being raised by monolingual japanese adult speakers .
the english - learning infants were being raised by monolingual english adult speakers or adult speakers whose first language is english .
for all japanese - learning infants , their weight was over 8 , 10 , and 9 kg and height was over 76 , 83 , and 82 cm at 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age , respectively .
for all english - learning infants , their weight was over 10 , 11 , and 10 kg and their height was over 78 , 84 , and 84 cm at 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age , respectively .
this showed that all infants exhibited normal physical development .
parental consent forms and information sheets were provided to a parent of each infant .
the procedures required for the project and the time involved were explained .
parental consent forms from each parent were received .
recordings utterances were recorded in a quiet room in each infant 's home for about 2 h a month .
special care was taken to keep each infant in a normal environment at home .
a digital sound recorder ( roland , r - 09hr or teac , dr - 07 ) was set to 44.1 - khz sampling and 16 - bit linear quantization .
the recorder was placed on a pillow in order to prevent vibration and reverberation .
it was kept at least 1 m away from the infant in order to stabilize the recording level .
the parent or parents were instructed to behave in a usual manner and to do daily activities during the recording process .
no specific procedures to elicit infant vocalization were utilized .
speech samples one of the authors and two students in the department of acoustic design and human science course at kyushu university extracted utterances from each 2 - h recording , using audio software ( syntrillium , cool edit 2000 , or adobe , audition ) based on the following criteria : silent parts of 75 ms before and after each utterance were included .
if a silent part between two potential utterances was shorter than 1200 ms , the whole pattern was considered a single utterance .
since we were particularly interested in rhythmic patterns in speech , we calculated autocorrelations of factor scores up to 1 s. this prohibited us from discarding silent intervals shorter than 1 s. for assurance , we included all silent intervals shorter than 1200 ms as part of the utterances to be analyzed .
if a single utterance was separated by adult speech or background noise , the separated parts were analyzed as different utterances .
if an utterance was overlapped by adult speech or background noise from toys or other objects , it was excluded from analysis .
anomalous vocal signals , such as laughter , crying , squeals , growls , and shrieking were excluded .
we constructed a database consisting of utterances of japanese - and english - learning infants .
speech samples longer than 1.5 s in this database represented 25 , 30 , and 54 % of all utterances for japanese - learning infants at 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age , respectively , and 23 , 27 , and 59 % of all utterances for english - learning infants at 15 , 20 , and 24 months , respectively .
table 1 presents information regarding the number of utterances and the average duration of utterances obtained for each infant .
in total , 484 , 474 , and 586 utterances were collected from japanese - learning infants at 15 , 20 , and 24 months , respectively ; 529 , 465 , and 426 utterances were collected from english - learning infants at 15 , 20 , and 24 months , respectively .

a bank of critical - band filters was constructed .
the total passband of the filter bank ranged from 100 to 12,000 hz , and the center frequencies of the filters ranged from 150 to 10,500 hz. the cutoff frequencies of the critical - band filters were based on zwicker and terhardt ( 1980 ) .
each filter was constructed as concatenate convolutions of an upward frequency glide and its temporal reversal .
both sides of the filters had slopes steeper than 90 db / oct .
each filter output was squared , smoothed with a gaussian window of sigma = 20 ms , and sampled at every 1 ms. factor analyses were performed based on the correlation matrices between the power fluctuations of the 22 critical - band filters .
in each age / language group , the average levels of all the speech samples were adjusted to be equal to each other , and the adjusted samples were connected in time for factor analysis .
the total duration of the connected signals was 667 , 626 , and 897 s for the japanese - learning infants and 630 , 512 , and 763 s for the english - learning infants , at 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age , respectively .
correlation - based ( normalized ) analysis was performed ; varimax rotation followed principal component analysis .
the number of factors was set at two or three in order to compare the present results with ueda and nakajima 's ( 2008 ) results .
in the following analysis , the autocorrelation functions were obtained in order to observe temporal periodicity in the factor scores .
the correlation between the nth and the ( n + k ) th sample in a time series of n samples was calculated as follows : r ( k )= sumn = 1n - kxn - x / 1xn + k - x / k + 1sumn = 1n - kxn - x / 12.sumn = kappa + 1nxn - x / k + 12,wherex / 1 = sumn = 1n - kxnn - k,andx / k + 1 = sumn = k + 1nxnn - k. the autocorrelation function of the temporal distance tau was defined as rtau = rtau.fs , where fs represents the sampling frequency ; r ( tau ) was defined only when tau . fs was an integer .
in the factor analysis , factor scores were sampled at every 1 ms. we used speech samples >= 1.5 s and observed temporal periodicity in factor scores by calculating autocorrelations up to 1 s. there was always a factor including a frequency range of 1000 - 1600 hz , and this factor seemed to be related to vowel - like sounds ( nakajima et al. , 2012 ) ; the autocorrelation of this factor ( factor scores as a function of time ) was calculated for each utterance in order to observe a global pattern of temporal periodicity , if any .
the amplitude of the first peak above zero was taken as the representative of an autocorrelation score .
if there was no peak above zero , the autocorrelation function was considered to be without a peak .
results factor analyses figures 1a - f show the results obtained from japanese - and english - learning infants at 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age .
factor 1 related to a frequency range around 1600 hz , factor 2 was bimodal surrounding factor 1 , and was related to frequency ranges around 350 hz and around 4000 hz , and factor 3 was related to high frequency ranges .

japanese - learning infants at 15 months of age ( a ) , english - learning infants at 15 months ( b ) , japanese - learning infants at 20 months ( c ) , english - learning infants at 20 months ( d ) , japanese - learning infants at 24 months ( e ) , and english - learning infants at 24 months ( f ) .
the solid lines , dashed lines , and dotted lines represent factors 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .
the factor loadings of factors 1 - 7 or 1 - 8 whose original principal components always exhibited eigenvalues greater than 1 , were observed .
the cumulative contributions obtained from the data for each language / age group were 50 - 57 % for the seven or eight components .
for comparison with adult speech , two or three factors were chosen .
the cumulative contributions were 30 - 32 % for the first three components .
the first three components showed clear correspondence with the adults' results for japanese - learning infants at 20 and 24 months , and english - learning infants at 24 months .
the second or third factor did not show clear correspondence with any particular frequency ranges for japanese - learning infants at 15 months or with english - learning infants at 15 and 20 months .
for older infants , factor 1 was surrounded by factor 2 , which was bimodal , and factor 3 was specifically related to the highest frequency range .
if factor loadings are indicated against frequency represented logarithmically , the configurations of the three factors in the infant speech at 24 months of age are well in correspondence with those in the adult speech in both linguistic environments ( see figure a3 in appendix ) .
peaks of the curves represented relatively high factor loadings , and we considered the crossover frequency of two adjacent curves as an indication of the boundary between the corresponding factors .
table 2 shows the obtained boundaries as represented by the closest center frequencies .
the first and second crossover points between factors 1 and 2 are indicated as the first and second boundary frequencies ; the crossover points between factors 2 and 3 are indicated as the third boundary frequencies .
if the boundary frequencies are difficult to observe , they are indicated as unclear .

this indicates that the 24 - month - old infants and the adult speakers used the articulation organs basically in the same way , and that the differences between the factor configurations were caused simply by the size differences - if the articulation organs are doubled in size , the frequencies indicating the factor locations are halved .
autocorrelation analyses we adopted the two - factor analysis , which produced visually clear results in most cases .
the cumulative contributions were 23 - 27 % for the two principal components .
there was always a factor including a frequency range around 1600 hz , which was similar to one of the factors in the three - factor analysis .
infants' utterances >= 1.5 s were selected from speech samples so that at least 1500 factor scores , sampled at every 1 ms ( as exactly as possible ) , were used for each autocorrelation analysis .
figure 2 shows an example of an autocorrelation function from a japanese - learning female infant at 24 months of age .
the amplitude of the first peak above zero ( 0.36 s in figure 2 ) was taken as the representative autocorrelation score .
if there was no peak above zero , the autocorrelation score was considered as without a peak .
for japanese - learning infants , the total numbers of utterances >= 1.5 s were 157 , 141 , and 311 at 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age , respectively .
for english - learning infants , the total numbers of utterances >= 1.5 s were 118 , 126 , and 251 at 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age , respectively .

figures 3a - c show the relative frequency distributions (%) of the first peaks for the japanese - and english - learning infants at 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age .
we focused on the first peaks located above 0.10 up to 0.40 s to explore the temporal periodicity , which was observed in previous studies ( see , e.g. , kouno , 2001 ; nathani et al. , 2003 ; dolata et al. , 2008 ) .
as shown in figure 4 , 15.9 , 22.7 , and 29.9 % of the first peaks were located in this range at 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age for the japanese - learning infants , compared with 13.6 , 15.9 , and 23.1 % for the english - learning infants .
a chi - square test was carried out .
for the japanese - learning infants , the results showed that the relative frequency of the first peaks located above 0.10 up to 0.40 s increased across age , and the change was statistically significant ( 15 , 20 , and 24 months of age ; chi2 = 11.35 , df = 2 , p < 0.01 ) .
there was a similar trend in the english - learning infants , but it was not statistically significant .

discussion the purpose of the present investigation was to explore how the spectral fluctuations and the temporal periodicity of infant speech changed in japanese - and english - learning infants between 15 and 24 months of age .
the factor analyses of spectral fluctuations showed that three factors observed in adult speech appeared by 24 months of age in both linguistic environments .
those three factors were shifted to a higher range corresponding to the smaller vocal tract size of the infants ( e.g. , goldstein , 1980 ; vorperian et al. , 2005 ) .
it is probable that the vocal tract structures of the infants had developed to adult - like configuration , but the whole vocal tract was still shorter than that of an adult .
this corresponds to the vocal development study by vorperian et al .
( 2005 ) , which showed that the sizes of the various vocal tract structures grew rapidly to achieve 55 - 80 % of that of the adult 's by 18 months of age .
the results also agree with previous studies ( e.g. , bond et al. , 1982 ; ishizuka et al. , 2007 ) , which showed there were rapid vowel space expansions during the first 2 years of age .
autocorrelations were calculated from temporal fluctuations of the factor scores .
it should be pointed out that the present study included a variety of utterances ; it differs from previous studies , in which speech samples were limited to disyllabic vocalizations ( e.g. , halle et al. , 1991 ; vihman et al. , 1998 ; davis et al. , 2000 ) .
one of the reasons that the previous analyses were limited to disyllabic vocalizations was the difficulty of measuring temporal periodicity .
conventional methods for adult speech , which are based on phonological properties , such as syllable structure and vowel reductions ( e.g. , ramus et al. , 1999 ; low et al. , 2000 ; deterding , 2001 ; grabe and low , 2002 ; white and mattys , 2007 ) , were not applicable to infants .
since phonological properties in infant utterances are obscure .
thus , measuring duration was a common way to explore temporal periodicity in infant utterances .
as roach ( 1982 ) pointed out , there was no automatic measurement to identify stressed syllables : phoneticians needed to judge stressed syllables by looking at speech waveforms , which might be influenced by incidental characteristics such as vowel length or pitch .
the present authors employed an automatic method to identify temporal periodicity ; it is based on temporal fluctuations of factor scores ( by calculating autocorrelations ) .
this method made it possible to explore the whole patterns of temporal periodicity in infant utterances .
the amount of utterances with periodic nature of shorter time ( up to 0.4 s ) increased with age .
the result corresponds to syllable durations observed in previous studies ( e.g. , kouno , 2001 ; nathani et al. , 2003 ; dolata et al. , 2008 ) .
it needs to be examined whether this trend reflects ambient language rhythm .
in conclusion , the present analysis of spectral fluctuation showed that three factors observed in adult speech appeared by 24 months of age in both linguistic environments .
those three factors were shifted to a higher frequency range corresponding to the smaller vocal tract size .
the amount of utterances with periodic nature of shorter time increased with age in both linguistic environments .
this trend seemed clearer in the japanese environment , which should be examined further in the future .

the present research was a part of kyushu university interdisciplinary programs in education and projects in research development ( the kyushu university project for interdisciplinary research of perception and cognition ) .
we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the parents and infants who were willing to participate in this study .
takuya kishida , bao zhimin and hirotoshi motomura gave us technical assistance .
appendix figure a1 the graph in ( a ) shows the results of factor analysis from adult japanese speakers ( n = 10 ) , and the graph in ( b ) shows the results from adult english speakers ( n = 10 ) .
the total number of sentences was 20 for each language group .
the solid lines , dashed lines , and dotted lines represent factors 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .
figure a2 the graph shows the autocorrelation score and time of the first peak for each sample of adult japanese speakers ( black square ) and adult english speakers ( white square ) .
the acoustic method clarified difference in temporal periodicity between japanese and english .
figure a3 the graphs in ( a ) show the results from japanese - learning infants at 24 months ( upper ) and adult japanese speakers ( lower ) , and the graphs in ( b ) show the results from english - learning infants at 24 months ( upper ) and adult english speakers ( lower ) .
the solid lines , dashed lines , and dotted lines represent factors 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .
adult speakers' data are from figure a1 .
the use of logarithmic frequency scales is helpful to compare the configurations of the factors in infant and adult speech .
the horizontal axis in the graph of adult speech was shifted by 1.7 times .
if a point in an upper graph and another point in a lower graph agreed with each other on the horizontal location , the frequency in the upper graph is 1.7 times as high as that in the lower graph .
the graphs showed that the configurations of the three factors in infant speech were in correspondence with those in adult speech .
roughly speaking , the frequency boundaries for the infant data were higher by a factor around 1.7 times .
this tolerably corresponds to the fact that infants' articulation organs at this age are 55 - 80 % in size compared with the adults' articulation organs ( vorperian et al. , 2005 ) .

objective to investigate the hiv - 1 molecular epidemiology among newly diagnosed hiv - 1 infected persons living in the jilin province of northeastern china .
methods plasma samples from 189 newly diagnosed hiv - 1 infected patients were collected between june 2010 and august 2011 from all nine cities of jilin province .
hiv - 1 nucleotide sequences of gag p17 - p24 and env c2 - c4 gene regions were amplified using a multiplex rt - pcr method and sequenced .
phylogenetic and recombination analyses were used to determine the hiv - 1 genotypes .
results based on all sequences generated , the subtype / cfr distribution was as follows : crf01 _ ae ( 58.1 %) , crf07 _ bc ( 13.2 %) , subtype b ' ( 13.2 %) , recombinant viruses ( 8.1 %) , subtype b ( 3.7 %) , crf02 _ ag ( 2.9 %) , subtype c ( 0.7 %) .
in addition to finding crf01 _ ae strains from previously reported transmission clusters 1 , 4 and 5 , a new transmission cluster was described within the crf07 _ bc radiation .
among 11 different recombinants identified , 10 contained portions of gene regions from the crf01 _ ae lineage .
crf02 _ ag was found to form a transmission cluster of 4 in local jilin residents .
conclusions our study presents a molecular epidemiologic investigation describing the complex structure of hiv - 1 strains co - circulating in jilin province .
the results highlight the critical importance of continuous monitoring of hiv - infections , along with detailed socio - demographic data , in order to design appropriate prevention measures to limit the spread of new hiv infections .

introduction in china , it is estimated that 780,000 people were living with hiv by the end of 2011 , according to the " china aids response progress report " [ 1 ] .
china is experiencing a dynamic and complex hiv / aids epidemic .
the reported predominant co - circulating hiv - 1 genotypes are : subtype b ' , circulating recombinant form ( crf ) crf01 _ ae , crf07 _ bc , and crf08 _ bc [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
these three crfs and the b ' subtype constituted 92.8 % of reported hiv - 1 infections in china in 2006 based on our nationwide molecular epidemiology survey , and were detected in all high - risk groups including former plasma donors ( fpds ) , injecting drug users ( idus ) , men having sex with men ( msm ) and heterosexual transmissions [ 2 ] .
co - circulation with strains from different hiv - 1 subtypes , crfs , and unique recombinant forms ( urfs ) in these risk groups can create opportunities for the emergence of new , hybrid recombinants [ 4 ] - [ 7 ] .
jilin province is located in the center of northeast china , bordering with russia to the east , the democratic people 's republic of korea ( dprk , also referred to as north korea ) across the rivers of yalu and tumen to the southeast , liaoning province to the southwest , inner mongolia autonomous region to the west , and heilongjiang province to the north .
jilin province encompasses an area of 187,400 square kilometers , and is divided into nine regions : changchun ( the capital of jilin province ) , jilin ( located in the center of jilin province ) , siping , tonghua , baishan , liaoyuan , baicheng , songyuan and yanbian korean autonomous prefecture .
according to the sixth nationwide population census of 2010 [ 8 ] , jilin province had a population of 27,462,297 , with a total of 44 ethnicities , including han , manchu , mongol and hui .
jilin 's central location contributes to a persistent influx and outflow of people , mainly due to trade , labor , tourism , and education ; this increasingly mobile population provides an increased opportunity for importing new hiv - 1 strains and increasing transmissions .
the first known aids case in jilin province was in a laborer infected through heterosexual contact with a female commercial sex worker ( csw ) in mombasa , kenya in 1993 , however , the hiv genotype of the infected patient was unknown .
jilin province experienced a low level of new hiv infections between 1993 and 1994 , and then the number of reported hiv infections increased yearly [ 8 ] .
a total of 1,477 hiv infections had been reported by the end of 2010 among all risk groups [ 9 ]. between 2004 and 2010 , the major risk for hiv - 1 infections changed from fpds ( 2.09 % in 2010 compared with 42.19 % in 2004 ) to those infected through sexual transmission ( 93.4 % in 2010 compared with 35.9 % in 2004 ) [ 10 ] .
in addition , the proportion of hiv - 1 infections among msm surged approximately 28 - fold : from 1.8 % ( 2 / 114 ) in 2005 to 48.6 % ( 139 / 286 ) in 2010 [ 10 ] .
however , the most heavily affected regions in jilin province were still concentrated in several big regions , including changchun , jilin and yanbian korean autonomous prefecture [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
the current distribution of hiv - 1 subtypes , crfs , and recombinants in jilin province is largely unknown .
therefore , a detailed hiv - 1 molecular epidemiologic investigation to determine the genotypic distribution and the emergence and spread of new subtypes and crfs is of great importance for understanding the dynamics of the hiv - 1 epidemic in this region .
in the present study , we performed an hiv - 1 molecular epidemiological investigation of 189 newly diagnosed hiv - infections in jilin province .
methods study subjects and dataset information a total of 189 newly diagnosed hiv - infected persons identified between january 2008 and december 2010 at local voluntary counseling and testing sites ( vct ) , sentinel surveillance sites , and medical institutions in jilin province were agreed to be enrolled in this study .
all newly diagnosed hiv - infected people were identified from various cities and risk groups .
whole blood samples were collected in 2010 ( n = 93 ) and 2011 ( n = 96 ) ; plasma was separated and stored at - 80degreesc .
the study was approved by the institutional review board of the national center for aids / std control and prevention , china cdc .
a written informed consent , as well as a socio - demographic questionnaire , was obtained from each participant in this study .
the socio - demographic data that was collected included sex , age , ethnicity , marital status , education background , year of diagnosis , year of sampling , site of sampling , cd4 + t cell count and risk group .
hiv - 1 rna extraction , amplification and sequencing plasma samples from 189 newly diagnosed hiv infected participants were collected and submitted for rt - pcr and sequencing .
viral rna was extracted from 280 microl of plasma using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit ( qiagen , valencia , california , usa ) following the manufacturer 's instructions [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
the extracted viral rna was subjected to a multiplex reverse transcription , polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) to obtain the nucleotide sequences of hiv - 1 gag p17 - p24 ( hxb2 : position 781 - 1836 for 1056 base pairs ( bp )) and env c2 - c4 ( hxb2 : positions 7002 - 754 for 540 bp ) gene regions as previously described [ 13 ] .
the positive pcr products were purified using qiaquick gel extraction kit ( qiagen , valencia , california , usa ) and sequenced directly on an abi 3730xl automated sequencer using bigdye terminators ( applied biosystems , foster city , california , usa ) by beijing biomed technology development co. , ltd ( beijing , china ) .
phylogenetic tree and recombination analysis the nucleotide sequences of the 134 hiv - 1 gag p17 - p24 and 121 env c2 - c4 gene regions were aligned separately using the gene cutter software ( http :// www.hiv.lanl.gov / cotent / sequence /. html ) with hiv - 1 group m subtype reference sequences [ los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) hiv sequence database ( http :// www.hiv.lanl.gov / cotent / sequence / newalign / align.html , accessed in april 2013 )] as follows : a1 ( 3 ) , a2 ( 3 ) , b ( 4 ) , c ( 4 ) , d ( 4 ) , f1 ( 4 ) , f2 ( 4 ) , g ( 4 ) , h ( 4 ) , j ( 3 ) , k ( 2 ) , crf01 _ ae ( 2 ) , crf02 _ ag ( 3 ) , crf08 _ bc ( 1 ) and group n ( 3 ) .
in addition to these 48 reference strains , we used 62 reference sequences from viruses that represent subtypes / crfs commonly identified in china as follows : subtypes a1 ( 1 ) , b ( 6 ) , b ' ( 7 ) , c ( 2 ) , crf07 _ bc ( 5 ) and crf01 _ ae ( 39 ) , crf08 _ bc ( 2 ) .
both gag and env sequences from these 110 reference strains were available .
following alignment , manual adjustments were made taking into consideration protein coding sequences using bioedit software [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
neighbor - joining phylogenetic trees were constructed using the kimura 2 - parameter model of evolution , including both transitions and transversions [ 16 ] , implemented in the mega 5.0 software package [ 17 ] .
the reliability of the tree structure or branching order was evaluated by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates [ 18 ] .
in order to better display the phylogenetic trees of the hiv - 1 gag p17 - p24 and env c2 - c4 regions , the sequences were separated into two different neighbor - joining trees , one containing only the subtype a , crf01 _ ae , crf02 _ ag - related sequences and the other representing the b / b ' , c , crf07 _ bc related sequences .
if there was evidence of recombination in any of the sequences ( i.e. , discordant gene regions or outlier position in a tree ) , they were further analyzed using the jumping profile hidden markov model program ( jphmm ; http :// jphmm.gobics.de /) [ 19 ] .
in order to confirm the possible recombinant structures and identify recombinant breakpoints of the potential hiv - 1 recombinants , bootscanning analysis was performed using simplot 3.5.1 software package with window size of 300 bp , step size of 20 bp ) [ 20 ] .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers all the nucleotide sequences obtained in this study were submitted to genbank under accession numbers of kf818784 - kf818917 for the hiv - 1 gag p17 - p24 gene region and kf818661 - kf818713 , kf818715 - kf818772 , kf818774 - kf818783 for the hiv - 1 env c2 - c4 gene region .
results demographic and epidemiologic information on the study participants a total of 189 newly diagnosed hiv - 1 infected samples were collected from local voluntary counseling and testing sites ( vct ) , sentinel surveillance sites and medical institutions in jilin province and were used for the hiv - 1 genetic analysis .
for each sample , gag p17 - p24 and env c2 - c4 genes were amplified and sequenced. from the 189 plasma samples , 134 gag p17 - p24 and 121 env c2 - c4 gene sequences were obtained ; 119 samples had both gag p17 - p24 and env c2 - c4 sequences ; a total of 136 samples were genotyped with a success rate of 72.0 % ( 136 / 189 ) .
the failure of pcr amplification or sequencing was likely related to factors such as poor transportation and storage conditions , low plasma volumes , low viral load , repeated freezing and thawing , and poor amplification and / or sequencing primer specificity .
the demographic and epidemiologic data are summarized in table s1 .
among the 189 participants , 81.5 % were males .
the mean age of the participants was 37.3 +/ - 12.9 years .
88.4 % ( 167 / 189 ) of participants were of han nationality and 11.6 % ( 22 / 189 ) of participants were minority nationalities , including korean , manchu , dai , yi , hui , lisu , and mongol .
the median cd4 + t cell count was 380 cells / microl , suggesting that most of these newly diagnosed participants had chronic infections .
the following risk groups were identified : msm ( 107 / 189 , 56.6 %) ; heterosexuals ( 65 / 189 , 34.4 %) ; fpds ( 9 / 189 , 94.8 %) ; idus ( 3 / 189 , 1.6 %) ; blood transfusion recipients ( 2 / 189 , 1.1 %) ; mother - to - child transmission ( 1 / 189 , 0.5 %) ; unknown ( 2 / 189 , 1.1 %) and geographical regions in jilin province : changchun ( 125 / 189 , 66.1 %) ; jilin ( 20 / 189 , 10.6 %) ; yanbian korean autonomous prefecture ( 15 / 189 , 7.9 %) ; tonghua ( 10 / 189 , 5.3 %) ; liaoyuan ( 4 / 189 , 2.1 %) ; baishan ( 4 / 189 , 2.1 %) ; baicheng ( 4 / 189 , 2.1 %) ; songyuan ( 4 / 189 , 2.1 %) ; and siping ( 3 / 189 , 1.6 %) .
hiv - 1 genotype distribution of the study participants phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences of 134 gag p17 - p24 and 121 env c2 - c4 gene regions are shown in fig. 1 and fig. 2 , respectively .
a total of 136 hiv - 1 samples were successfully amplified and genotyped for at least one gene region , and most for both gene regions ( table 1 and table s2 ) .
the classifications for the 119 samples having both gag and env sequences ( gag / env ) were as follows : crf01 / crf01 ( 69 / 119 , 58.0 %) , subtype b '/ b ' ( 17 / 119 , 14.3 %) , crf07 / crf07 ( 16 / 119 , 13.4 %) , crf02 / crf02 ( 4 / 119 , 3.4 %) , subtype b / b ( 2 / 119 , 1.7 %) , and subtype c / c ( 1 / 119 , 0.8 %) .
furthermore , there were 10 ( 8.4 %) samples with discordant gag // env phylogenies , and 2 of these showed complex levels of recombination involving gene regions from at least 3 different subtypes / crfs : crf07 // crf01 ( 3 / 119 , 2.5 %) , crf01 // b ( 1 / 119 , 0.8 %) , b // crf01 ( 1 / 119 , 0.8 %) , crf01 / c // c ( 2 / 119 , 1.7 %) , crf01 / crf07 // crf07 ( 1 / 119 , 0.8 %) , crf01 / c // crf01 ( 1 / 119 , 0.8 %) and a1 / g // h ( 1 / 119 , 0.8 %) ( table 2 and table s2 ) .
the distribution of genotypes for the samples having only gag sequences were as follows : crf01 _ ae ( 10 / 17 , 58.8 %) , subtype b ( 2 / 17 , 11.8 %) , crf07 _ bc ( 2 / 17 , 11.8 %) , crf01 / b '/ c ( 1 / 17 , 5.9 %) and the two with only env sequences were both subtype b ( 2 / 17 , 11.8 %) ( table s2 ) .
six gag sequences were located outside of the subtype / crf clusters , suggesting that they might be intersubtype recombinants .
bootscanning analyses of the 6 gag sequences showed the following recombinant structures : 3 crf01 _ ae / c , 1 crf01 _ ae / b '/ c , 1 crf01 _ ae / crf07 _ bc and 1 a1 / g ( fig.s1 ) .
the demographic and genotypic characteristics of the 136 participants with available nucleotide sequences are summarized in table 1 .

our previous national - wide study [ 21 ] identified 7 major , distinct lineages among china 's crf01 _ ae epidemic .
we found that some jilin province crf01 _ ae strains sub - clustered with crf01 - 4 ( 22 / 79 , 27.8 %) and crf01 - 5 ( 54 / 79 , 68.4 %) lineages , predominantly found among msm in both this and our previous study ( fig. 1a and fig. 2a ) [ 21 ] , and just one strain of crf01 - 1 ( 1 / 79 , 1.3 %) , commonly found among heterosexuals and idus in the previous study , but in a heterosexual transmission in this study .
in addition , one sequence did not group with other known transmission clusters ( 1 / 79 , 1.3 %) ( designated as crf01 - ng ) .
in the present study , we found 1 crf01 _ ae recombinant consisting of crf01 - 5 in gag and crf01 - 4 regions in env .
we also identified two strongly supported monophyletic transmission sub - clusters of crf07 _ bc among sexual transmissions based on both gag and env sequences ; crf07 _ bc - 1 was previously identified [ 24 ] - [ 26 ] .
however , in the current study , a new lineage , designated crf07 _ bc - 2 , was identified only in msm from jilin and songyuan .
among 18 crf07 _ bc strains identified in the present study , 6 ( 33.3 %) and 8 ( 44.4 %) belonged to crf07 - 1 and crf07 - 2 respectively , and 4 ( 22.2 %) crf07 _ bc strains were located outside of these two clusters ( fig. 1b and fig. 2b and table 1 ) .
hiv - 1 genotype distribution by risk group as summarized in table 1 , a socio - demographic study was performed to better characterize the distribution of hiv - 1 genotypes .
we found intermixing of hiv - 1 subtypes / crfs in sexual transmissions ( msm and heterosexual ) accounting for 92.6 % of the genotyped infections .
based on hiv - 1 gag p17 - p24 and / or env c2 - c4 , among the msm population , crf01 _ ae , crf07 _ bc , subtype b and recombinants accounted for 78.3 % , 13.3 % , 6.0 % and 2.4 % of hiv - infections , respectively .
the greatest diversity of hiv subtypes and recombinant viruses was observed among the heterosexual population with crf01 _ ae , subtype b ' , recombinants , crf07 _ bc and crf02 _ ag accounting for 32.6 % , 30.2 % , 16.3 % , 14.0 % and 7.0 % of the infections , respectively .
recombinants were primarily found among the heterosexual transmissions compared to other risk groups , accounting for 63.6 % ( 7 / 11 ) of all recombinants ( table 1 and table 2 ) .
subtype b ' ( 13 / 18 , 72.2 %) and crf02 _ ag ( 3 / 4 , 75.0 %) were most frequently identified among the heterosexual population ; none were found in our 83 msm .
crf01 _ ae was the primary hiv - 1 genotype found among the msm and heterosexual populations , while no crf01 _ ae strains were identified in our 3 idus .
three different genotypes were detected among our 3 idus : subtype c ( 33.3 %) , crf02 _ ag ( 33.3 %) and crf07 _ bc ( 33.3 %) .
hiv - 1 genotype distribution by geographic region as shown in table 1 and figure 2 , most hiv sequences were collected in changchun ( 92 / 136 , 67.6 %) , jilin ( 19 / 136 , 14.0 %) and yanbian korean autonomous prefecture ( 11 / 136 , 8.1 %) .
six out of the 7 identified subtypes / crfs of hiv - 1 were found in changchun .
most of these hiv - infections were found in msm ( 72 / 92 , 78.3 %) and heterosexuals ( 19 / 92 , 20.7 %) , and the two predominant genotypes were crf01 _ ae ( 68 / 92 , 73.9 %) and crf07 _ bc ( 11 / 92 , 12.0 %) .
seven out of 8 ( 87.5 %) of the newly identified crf07 - 2 strains were identified in changchun , and the other crf07 - 2 infection was found in the neighboring city of songyuan. of note , 95.5 % of crf01 - 4 and 83.3 % of crf01 - 5 co - circulated in changchun , therefore , it was not surprising that we discovered a recombinant genotype ( designated jl.dg01 ) comprised of gene regions from both crf01 - 4 and crf01 - 5 .
however , it should be noted that 68 % of all our sequences were from changchun .
in the city of jilin , heterosexual ( 9 / 19 , 47.4 %) and fpd ( 5 / 19 , 26.3 %) were the two major risk groups for hiv - infections with subtype b ' ( 8 / 19 , 42.1 %) , followed by crf01 _ ae ( 4 / 19 , 21.1 %) , urfs ( 4 / 19 , 21.1 %) and crf07 _ bc ( 3 / 19 , 15.8 %) .
in yanbian korean autonomous prefecture , the major risk group was heterosexual transmission ( 10 / 11 , 90.9 %) , which was comprised of subtype b ' ( 3 / 11 , 27.3 %) , crf02 _ ag ( 3 / 11 , 27.3 %) , crf01 _ ae ( 2 / 11 , 18.2 %) , recombinant viruses ( 2 / 11 , 18.2 %) and crf07 - 1 ( 1 / 11 , 9.1 %) .
the sampling size in the remaining cities was very small ( table 1 , fig. 3 ) .

discussion here we describe the most comprehensive hiv - 1 molecular epidemiologic investigation , to date , on the characteristics and trends of the hiv / aids epidemic in the jilin province of northeastern china between 2010 and 2011 .
jilin province , as well as most of china , is experiencing an increasingly complex hiv epidemic .
we identified subtypes b , b ' , and c , crf01 _ ae ( including lineages crf01 - 1 , crf01 - 4 and crf01 - 5 ) , crf02 _ ag , crf07 _ bc ( crf07 - 1 and the newly identified lineage crf07 - 2 ) , and recombinant viruses ; crf01 _ ae was the predominant genotype in both heterosexual and msm sequences .
in a previous nation - wide study [ 21 ] , we identified 7 unique , strongly supported , phylogenetic sub - clusters or lineages among the crf01 _ ae radiation nation - wide .
these lineages were partially segregated by geographic regions of china and different risk groups .
the first three lineages ( crf01 - 1through crf01 - 3 ) were prevalent among idus and heterosexuals from the south and southwest , lineages crf01 - 4 and crf01 - 5 were primarily found in msm from northern cities , and sub - clusters crf01 - 6 and crf01 - 7 were found in heterosexuals from southern china .
in the current study , we identified three of these crf01 _ ae lineages .
crf01 - 4 and crf01 - 5 were found among sexual transmissions , both heterosexual and msm , while the one crf01 - 1 virus was identified in a heterosexual male .
previous studies have found that there was a large and strongly supported transmission sub - cluster of crf07 _ bc strains among msm in beijing , liaoning , and shijiazhuang within the crf07 radiation [ 22 ] - [ 24 ] , we designated this crf07 _ bc sub - cluster as crf07 - 1 .
in this current study , we found the route of transmissions for crf07 - 1 had expanded to include heterosexuals as well as msm in jilin province .
furthermore , a new statistically supported , monophyletic transmission cluster of crf07 _ bc ( designated crf07 - 2 ) was identified among seven msm from changchun and one msm from songyuan , which is geographically adjacent to the northwestern portion of changchun .
although the sample sizes are still fairly small relative to the epidemic , crf07 - 1 has spread throughout much of jilin province and is transmitted by both heterosexuals and msm , while crf07 - 2 has only been found among msm in changchun and neighboring songyuan .
originally subtype b ' infections in china were identified primarily among idu in yunnan province and subsequently among fpd and heterosexual in inland china , due to unhygienic commercial plasma collections during the early to mid - 1990s , after which the practice was banned [ 25 ] .
the majority of subtype b ' infections are now found in the heterosexual population [ 2 ] .
this shift in risk groups is most likely the result of national policies in china that strictly regulated blood donations , which began in the late 1990s [ 26 ] and the fact that the hiv - infected fpd were spreading subtype b ' viruses through heterosexual transmissions to their sex partners .
indeed , we found no subtype b ' infections among our 83 msm from jilin province .
while these comparisons of genotypes and risk groups are interesting , and appear to indicate certain trends , it must be highlighted that the samples were collected by convenience and do not represent a random sampling .
an unknown degree of sampling bias is likely .
in the present study , we also detected a new statistically supported monophyletic cluster of 4 crf02 _ ag uniquely associated with korean ethnicity and heterosexuals near the jilin - north korean border ( yanbian korean autonomous prefecture ) .
the exception was an idu in changchun , who was also a citizen of yanbian korean autonomous prefecture but was imprisoned in changchun .
in a previous study , it was also showed that crf02 _ ag predominated among heterosexuals in cina , accounting for at least 68.8 % of all detected crf02 _ ag in a nationwide cross - sectional study of hiv - 1 epidemic in china .
in light of the fact that the four study participants were all of korean ethnicity , it is tempting to speculate that the crf02 _ ag cluster detected in the present study originated in yanbian korean autonomous prefecture .
it is the first report of crf02 _ ag forming a transmission cluster in a local resident population in china .
in the past , crf02 _ ag had only been found in migrating workers from west africa [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
among the complex mix of subtypes and crfs that co - circulate in china , it was not surprising to find the emergence of gag and gag / env recombinants .
all but 1 ( 90.9 %) of the 11 recombinants we found contained at least a portion of crf01 _ ae , which is consistent with crf01 _ ae being the predominant genotype among both heterosexual and msm transmissions .
overall , the highest hiv - 1 genotype diversity was observed among the heterosexual population , however , we only had three idu samples .
if we had a larger sampling of idus , we may have found a larger genotype diversity in this risk group too , due to the presence of both needle sharing and sexual routes of infection .
in fact , from the three jilin idu sequences , we found three different genotypes , subtype c , crf07 _ bc , and crf02 _ ag , supporting the hypothesis that if more samples were available from idus , we might have found a genotype diversity at lease as high as that seen in heterosexual transmissions .
china 's hiv epidemic is very heterogeneous , composed of a series of overlapping local sub - epidemics defined by risk groups , as well as temporal and / or spatial variation [ 29 ] - [ 34 ] .
detecting these sub - epidemics can be challenging because hiv diagnosis may take place many years after infection , and because of reliance on risk group self - reporting .
idu , msm , and heterosexual risk factors are complicated by frequent ' bridging ' between risk groups , caused by concurrent risk behaviours .
idus constitute a high - risk group , which can facilitate hiv spread to lower risk populations through sexual risk factors [ 35 ] - [ 43 ] .
while msm has become the predominant route of hiv transmission [ 40 ] , [ 44 ],[ 45 ] , it is common for msm in china to be bisexual [ 41 ] - [ 43 ] , because of traditional values and family expectations ; 17 - 35 % of msm are married [ 46 ] - [ 49 ] and more than 70 % will be married in their lifetime [ 48 ] , [ 50 ] .
furthermore , an estimated 8.3 % of msm used drugs in the past 6 months and 5 - 25 % sold sex to other men [ 50 ] - [ 56 ] .
in conclusion , our study indicates that the hiv epidemic in jilin province is very complex ; effective control will require an understanding of the dynamics that drives the spread of hiv through social / sexual transmission networks [ 57 ] , [ 58 ] .
future molecular epidemiologic studies need to focus on collecting detailed behavioral and socio - demographic information that will allow the characterization of common behavioral risk factors for each of the identified social / sexual transmission clusters .
since transmission clusters significantly drive the hiv - 1 epidemic in china , characterizing the specific , common risk behaviors for these networks will help target intervention strategies .

the purpose of the study was twofold : to assess the relationship between antiretroviral adherence and social position among colombian women with hiv / aids and to examine the possibility of expanding the medical concept of adherence to treatment including a " social determinants of health " perspective .
method a mixed method approach with a qualitative and quantitative sequential design was applied .
in the phase of formative research semi - structured interviews were conducted with 7 national experts in the field .
the qualitative component of the study included 10 focus groups with a total of 99 women ; in - depth interviews were conducted with 14 of these participants .
another 269 women from five different cities completed a socio - demographic and clinical questionnaire , an adherence to treatment questionnaire , and a social position survey designed according to the colombian socioeconomic structure .
content analyses were applied to analyze the qualitative data and logistic regressions were used to analyze the quantitative data .
results significant statistical associations and qualitative patterns between adherence and social position were found .
women in a medium and high social position were more likely to present higher adherence behaviors than women in low social position .
also , healthcare system barriers , being a caregiver of children with hiv / aids , and individual coping styles were found as critical factors for adherence behaviors .
conclusions adherence to treatment in colombian hiv positive women is determined by their social position .
research on antiretroviral adherence and the concept of adherence itself should include a " social determinants of health " perspective in order to maximize the likelihood of obtaining better clinical outcomes .
the findings of the study should also serve as a point of reference for reviewing current healthcare guidelines for people living with hiv / aids in colombia .

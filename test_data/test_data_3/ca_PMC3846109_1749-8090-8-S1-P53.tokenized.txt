we present our experiences of surgical treatment of af with asd in adults .
methods 84 adult patients ( mean age 40,8 +/ - 7,2 years ) with asd and different forms of af were operated between 2005 - 2012 with next forms of af : paroxysmal - 48 , persistent - 26 , long persistent - 10 patients .
we performed radiofrequency " maze iii " procedure and then asd closure in cpb .
mean cpb - time was 64 +/ - 18 min .
lines of ablation were performed point - by - point applications with exposition of 15 seconds .
all patients were on amyodaron - therapy for the first three months .
the follow - up period was from 24 to 36 months .
standard 12 - lead ecg was done daily during the postoperative hospital stay and at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months postoperatively .
to evaluate cardiac function and the recovery of the atrial contraction tte was performed before discharge and at 3 , 6 , and 12 months postoperatively .
results at 6 months follow - up sinus or atrial rhythm was present in 73 ( 86.9 %) patients .
53 ( 63,1 %) patients have no need of antiarrhythmic therapy .
right atrial contractility was restored in 100 % ( 84 / 84 ) and left atrial contractility in 67.9 % ( 57 / 84 ) of patients .
lvef was increased from 0.43 +/ - 0.02 to 0.52 +/ - 0.10 ( p < 0.05 ) .
in 3 cases ( 3.6 %) sinus node dysfunction was developed and needed permanent cardiac pacing ( aair mode ) .
conclusions the main hemodynamic factor in patients after " maze iii " procedure is preservation of av - synchrony .
the maintaining sinus rhythm and av - synchrony is more important , than restoration of atrial systolic function .
the mean lvef increased in postop period .
independent risk factors for late af recurrence were longer duration of af (> 60 months ) ( or = 2.721 , p = 0.025 ) , increased left atrial size ( or = 1.105 , p = 0.004 ) .
duration of af is predisposable factor for sinus node dysfunction development .

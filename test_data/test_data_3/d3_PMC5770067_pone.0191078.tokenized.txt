static magnetic field ( smf ) has shown some possibilities for cancer therapies .
in particular , the combinational effect between smf and anti - cancer drugs has drawn scientists' attentions in recent years .
however , the underlying mechanism for the drug - specific synergistic effect is far from being understood .
besides , the drugs used are all conventional chemotherapy drugs , which may cause unpleasant side effects .
in this study , our results demonstrate for the first time that smf could enhance the anti - cancer effect of natural compound , capsaicin , on hepg2 cancer cells through the mitochondria - dependent apoptosis pathway .
we found that the synergistic effect could be due to that smf increased the binding efficiency of capsaicin for the trpv1 channel .
these findings may provide a support to develop an application of smf for cancer therapy .
the present study offers the first trial in combining smf with natural compound on anti - cancer treatment , which provides additional insight into the interaction between smf and anti - cancer drugs and opens the door for the development of new strategies in fighting cancer with minimum cytotoxicity and side effects .

introduction magnetic fields with different intensities naturally exist in the world .
the earth 's magnetic field of around 0.3 - 0.6 gauss is required for many animals to navigate during migration .
a permanent magnet composed of many magnetic dipoles produces its own static magnetic field ( smf ) .
smfs are time - independent fields and can interact directly with moving charges .
to date , there were many in vivo and in vitro studies highlighting the beneficial effects on biological systems with smf exposure [ 1 ] .
for example , jing et al. showed that 180 mt smf presented a beneficial effect on diabetic wound healing in 3 - month - old rats [ 2 ] .
the acceleration of new bone tissue formation [ 3 ] , the stimulation of neurite outgrowth [ 4 , 5 ] , the pain relief [ 1 , 6 ] , blood pressure modulation [ 7 ] , and the anti - inflammatory effects [ 8 ] by smf exposure were also observed .
one fascinating therapeutic use of smf is the cancer - fighting application , in which researches have shown that solo smf has the potential to inhibit cancer cell through different mechanisms , such as retarded vessel maturation by anti - angiogenesis [ 9 ] , reduction in immunoreactive p53 expression [ 10 ] , and influence on the calcium signaling pathway [ 11 ] .
although the above results provided some understandings about the effect of smf on cancer cells , most studies claimed that smf as monotherapy is not sufficiently successful , but prefers the combinational effects with chemotherapy drugs [ 10 , 12 ] .
for example , the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy drugs such as taxol [ 13 , 14 ] , cisplatin [ 15 ] , and doxorubicin [ 12 ] were enhanced by moderate smf with different intensities .
these data indicate that smf might be an assisted method for cancer chemotherapy , allowing minimum dosage of drugs to produce maximum curative effect .
however , the mechanism of the synergistic effect between smf and anticancer drugs is far from being understood .
some researches provided evidence of smf - induced changes of cell surface structure increasing the permeability of cell membranes [ 12 ] .
gellrich et al. found smf increased tumor microvessel leakiness and improved antitumoral efficacy in combination with paclitaxel in vivo [ 14 ] .
nevertheless , the increased permeability can hardly explain the drug - specific synergism or antagonism behavior between smf and different drugs [ 12 , 13 , 16 ] , and so far little attention has been put on the interaction between smf and drugs .
besides , the drugs used in these experiments are all conventional chemotherapy drugs , which may cause unpleasant side effects .
nowadays , there has been an emerging area of cancer prevention and cure focused on natural compounds , especially the dietary products because of their low toxicity and potent efficacy .
in this work , we choose capsaicin to be studied , which is the major pungent ingredient of the hot chili peppers and responsible for their spicy flavor .
in particular , recent studies have demonstrated the anti - cancer activity of capsaicin in various types of cancer models [ 17 , 18 ] .
capsaicin binds to distinct cell surface receptors , including the most well - known ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( trpv1 ) [ 19 ] .
trpv1 channel is a non - selective cation channel , which has an important role in heat sensors .
this ion channel is activated by several physical , chemical and biological factors [ 20 ] .
drugs which could regulate trpv1 channel activity could be useful for the treatment of conditions ranging from chronic pain to hearing loss [ 21 ] .
previous studies have shown that trpv1 acts as a tumor suppressor through inducing tumor apoptosis upon activation by its agonist [ 22 ] .
therefore , in this study , the involvement of trpv1 was also investigated in the hepg2 cells undergoing capsaicin and smf induced apoptosis .
previous research had shown the time - dependent modifications of hepg2 cells during exposure to smf [ 11 ] .
however , the data indicated that the biological effects of 6 mt smf on hepg2 cells are not cytotoxic .
besides , capsaicin - induced apoptosis was also observed in hepg2 cells [ 23 ] .
therefore , the objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic anti - cancer effect of smf and capsaicin on hepg2 cells .
in this paper , we study the combinational anti - cancer effects of smf with capsaicin by means of the cell viability as well as light microscopy .
the apoptotic signaling pathways were evaluated by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy .
our results demonstrated that smf enhanced the effect of natural compound , capsaicin , to inhibit the growth of cancer cells for the first time .
the trpv1 activation was confirmed to participate in the synergistic anti - cancer effect by the antagonist experiment and the change of calcium in cytoplasm related to the treatments .
these data first indicate that combining smf exposure with capsaicin is a promising therapy strategy , which sheds light on new anti - cancer treatments in combination of magnetic field and other nature compounds .

cell viability assay viability of hepg2 cells after treatments with smf and capsaicin was assessed by mtt assay .
briefly , the medium was replaced with mtt solution ( 0.5 mg / ml in dmem ) and incubated at 37degreesc for 3.5 h. during this period , the ability of mitochondrial dehydrogenases to reduce the mtt to formazan is an indicator of cellular viability .
the supernatants were then replaced with dmso and incubated for complete solubility of formazan crystal .
the optical density of each well was then determined at 570 nm using a fluostar optima microplate reader .
the cell viability was calculated based on the intensity of formazan , and expressed as percentage of non - treated control .
western blot analysis protein expression levels were investigated by western blot of whole hepg2 cell lysates .
adherent cells were washed with cold pbs , and scraped off from culture dishes in ripa lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail .
the collected cells were lysed by incubation with the lysis buffer for 30 min on ice .
lysates were vortexed and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4degreesc .
after centrifugation , the supernatants were collected and the protein concentrations were determined by bradford protein assay ( bioshop , canada ) using bovine serum albumin as standard .
each lysate was denatured for 5 min at 95degreesc in sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) 5x sample buffer .
an equal amount of proteins ( 30 mug ) were resolved by 10 % sds - page at 40 ma for 2 h and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride ( pvdf ) membrane .
the pvdf membrane was stained with ponceau s to verify the proper transfer .
nonspecific protein binding was blocked in 5 % nonfat dry milk in tbst ( 20 mm tris - base , ph 7.6 ; 0.15 m nacl , 0.1 % tween 20 ) for 1 h at rt. after blockage , the membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4degreesc .
the membranes were washed four times with tbst solution for 5 min each , and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( 1:500 dilution ; jackson immunoresearch inc. ) in blocking solution .
the density of the targeted bands was visualized by the enhanced chemoluminescence ( ecl ) substrate ( advansta ) .
signals were detected by image system ( amersham imager 600 ; ge healthcare life science ) .
immunofluorescence microscopy at the end of capsaicin and smf treatments , cells were washed with pbs and fixed with 3.7 % paraformaldehyde ( pfa ; sigma ) in pbs for 15 min at rt. fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.1 % triton x - 100 in pbs for 15 min .
nonspecific protein binding was blocked with 1 % bsa in pbs for 20 min at rt. after washing three times with pbs , the cells were incubated with anti - beta - tubulin ( 1:1000 dilution ; abcam ) and anti - active caspase - 3 ( 1:800 dilution ; cell signaling technology ) primary antibodies overnight at 4degreesc .
the cells were then washed three times in pbs , and incubated in the alexa fluor 488 - conjugated donkey anti - goat secondary antibody and the alexa fluor 647 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( 1:500 dilution ; jackson immunoresearch inc. ) for 1 h at 37degreesc in the dark .
the coverslips were mounted to slides in mounting medium with dapi ( abcam ) .
the mounted samples were examined by a zeiss lsm 880 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope .
pictures of randomly selected areas were taken for each sample and representative micrographs are shown in the figures .
flow cytometry apoptosis was analysed by flow cytometry with the annexin v - fitc and propidium iodide ( pi ) double - staining method ( bd biosciences ) .
cells used for flow cytometry were collected by trypsinization and washed three times with ice - cold pbs before they were resuspended in 1x binding buffer .
then , 100 mul of the solution ( 2 x 105 cells ) was transferred to a 5 ml culture tube .
cells were stained with annexin v and pi for 15 min at 25degreesc in the dark .
another 400 mul of the 1x binding buffer was added to each tube before they were analysed by flow cytometry .
intracellular calcium assay the levels of calcium in hepg2 cells was determined by rhod - 4 no wash calcium assay kit ( abcam ) .

results 0.5 t smf increases the inhibition effect of capsaicin on hepg2 cell proliferation we used mtt assay to examine the viability of hepg2 cell under smf and / or capsaicin administration .
cells were treated with capsaicin , combined with or without smf exposure for 72 h. fig 1a shows that the hepg2 cells were inhibited by capsaicin in a dose - dependent manner .
cell proliferation was reduced significantly when the concentration of capsaicin was above 100 mum .
previous studies had shown that 100 mum capsaicin induced significant neurotoxicity in cultured neuron cells [ 24 ] .
in this study , we aim to investigate the combinational effect of capsaicin and smf , so we choose the concentrations of capsaicin below 100 mum .
we first evaluate the effect of 0.5 t smf on the viability of hepg2 cells .
our results show that the hepg2 cell proliferation of the smf treated group did not differ from that of the control group , indicating that smf alone will not cause inhibition effect on hepg2 cells .
interestingly , the experiments showed that 0.5 t smf could increase the efficacy of capsaicin in hepg2 cells .
for example , the viability of hepg2 cells in the group treated with 50 mum capsaicin can be further reduced by about 20 % in combination with 0.5 t smf ( fig 1b ) .
for 75 mum capsaicin , which already reduced the viability of hepg2 cells , its inhibition effect was also increased by 0.5 t smf .
light microscopy images also showed significant inhibiting effect in the smf + capsaicin group after 72 h treatment ( fig 1c ) .
effect of capsaicin and smf on expression of bax and bcl - 2 proteins to investigate the role of proteins involved in capsaicin and smf - induced cell death , we carried out western blotting of bcl - 2 family proteins bax and bcl - 2 .
it was known that the increased bax / bcl - 2 ratio indicates the up - regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways [ 25 - 27 ] .
the western blot result ( fig 2 ) shows that 50 mum capsaicin caused an elevation in bax protein level , and the level was further enhanced under smf stimulation .
on the contrary , the bcl - 2 protein level was decreased in the capsaicin and capsaicin plus smf treated groups .
as a result , the increased bax / bcl - 2 ratio in the capsaicin treated group was further elevated under smf stimulation .
the result confirmed that the potency of capsaicin was indeed increased under 0.5 t smf exposure .

smf enhances the effect of capsaicin - induced apoptosis to further understand the mechanism of capsaicin and smf - induced cell death , we investigated the cleaved caspase - 3 expression on hepg2 cells by confocal microscope .
caspase - 3 is one of the key executioners of apoptotic events in cells , and since it serves as a convergent downstream from different signaling pathways , it is well suited as an indicator in an apoptosis assay .
in experiments , hepg2 cells were double - stained with beta - tubulin and active caspase - 3 , and dapi was used to visualize the nuclei of cells .
as seen in fig 3 , the cell shape was clearly outlined by beta - tubulin marker .
typical morphological changes of cell apoptosis , such as blebbing and nucleus fragmentation can be detected in dapi staining ( zoomed - in views in fig 3 ) .
an antibody against cleaved caspase - 3 showed negligible signal in the control cells , whereas the active caspase - 3 signals were increased in capsaicin treated cells , and further increased under smf treatment ( fig 3 ) .
the cleaved caspase - 3 immunofluorescent signals caused by 50 mum capsaicin treatment were significantly increased under smf exposure , which again demonstrated the synergistic effect of smf and capsaicin .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0191078.g003 fig 3 smf exposure aggravated active caspase - 3 intensities .
confocal images of hepg2 cells treated with 50 mum capsaicin with or without smf for 72 h. red fluorescence represents active caspase - 3 staining ; cell shapes were marked with beta - tubulin green fluorescence and nuclei were labeled with dapi .
the upper right corner in the dapi group showed the zoomed - in view of nuclei .
scale bar : 50 mum .
smf increases capsaicin - induced hepg2 cell apoptosis to confirm whether smf and capsaicin decreased cell survival by the induction of apoptosis , hepg2 cells were cultured with capsaicin with or without smf exposure and then assessed with flow cytometry .
cells were double stained with annexin v - fitc and pi. annexin v has a strong affinity for phosphatidylserine ( ps ) residues , and therefore can be used as a probe for detecting apoptosis .
fig 4 shows that incubation with 50 mum capsaicin for 72 h did increase the percentage of apoptotic cells from 1.5 % in the control group to 32.1 % .
co - treatment with smf exposure significantly enhanced capsaicin - induced hepg2 cell apoptosis to 59.3 % .

the cells in the lower right quadrant indicate annexin v - positive , pi - negative , early apoptotic cells .
percentages of viable , early and late apoptotic cells in different conditions were listed in the table below .
blocking capsaicin - binding trpv1 affects the synergistic anti - cancer activity of smf and capsaicin in order to realize whether trpv1 is involved in the synergistic anti - cancer effect , the selective trpv1 antagonist sb - 705498 (( n - ( 2 - bromophenyl ) - n ' - [(( r ) - 1 - ( 5 - tri - fluromethyl - 2 - pyridyl ) pyrrolidin - 3 - yl )] urea ) was incubated with the cells 30 min before smf and capsaicin treatments [ 28 ] .
we found that incubation of hepg2 cells with trpv1 antagonist abrogated the effect of smf and capsaicin induced cell apoptosis as evidenced by the mtt viability assay ( see fig 5 ) .
the result showed that disrupting the function of trpv1 blocked the enhanced effect of smf on cancer cell apoptosis .
this suggests that the smf enhanced apoptosis may be mediated by the trpv1 - dependent mechanisms .

effects of capsaicin and smf on intracellular calcium levels the fluorescence of the rhod - 4 loading dye is greatly enhanced once inside the cell and binding to calcium .
intracellular calcium concentrations were measured with a microplate reader at ex / em = 532 / 555 nm. fig 6 shows that capsaicin treatment greatly increased the intracellular calcium concentration which is a known fact since capsaicin is a trpv1 channel agonist .
on the other hand , smf alone did not influence the calcium level significantly .
interestingly , the combined treatment of smf and capsaicin significantly increased the calcium concentration compared with capsaicin only group .

discussion the focus of our research was to investigate the synergistic anti - cancer effect of smf and capsaicin on hepg2 cells .
liver cancer is one of the most frequent and leading cause of cancer death .
the incidence of liver cancer is rising worldwide due to various factors that may cause cirrhosis , including the widely disseminated hepatitis b and c viruses and alcohol use .
the therapeutic efficacy of recent surgery and chemotherapy are limited , and some of the chemotherapy drugs may cause more severe side effects in people with cirrhosis [ 29 ] .
therefore , research looking for appropriate drugs and method which produce maximum effect and minimum unpleasant side effects is a matter of vital importance .
previous studies have shown that smf has the ability to enhance the effect of some anti - cancer drugs [ 14 ] .
however , most studies still remain focusd on conventional chemotherapy drugs .
no attempt was made to investigate the combinational effect of smf and natural compounds .
to date , cancer therapy and prevention by natural compounds have shown promising results against various malignancies in vitro and in vivo [ 30 ] .
due to their low cytotoxic effects in normal cells , natural products had been a highly useful source for anti - cancer drugs .
the novelty of this study is the use of capsaicin , one of the food additive consumed worldwide , in combination with smf to further inhibit the cancer cells .
in agreement with other reports [ 18 ] , we found capsaicin also induces cell inhibition on hepg2 cells in a dose dependent manner .
in this study , we choose lower concentration of capsaicin (< 100 mum ) to investigate the biological effects in capsaicin - treated cancer cells under the exposure of smf .
regarding to the combination of smf exposure with capsaicin , our results in the cell viability assay have provided clear evidence for an additional synergistic effect of the combination therapy .
in comparison to the monotherapy of smf or capsaicin , the combination treatment yielded a higher inhibition effect in tumor growth .
in the present study , we found that 50 mum capsaicin is the most effective parameter to work synergistically with smf .
this result suggests that there is an appropriate treatment level that magnetic field and anti - cancer drugs could inhibit the cancer cell proliferation synergistically .
literature reports indicate that capsaicin binds to distinct cell surface receptors [ 31 , 32 ] and can modulate membrane protein function by altering bilayer elasticity [ 33 ] .
in particular , efforts have been made to understand the specific and selective receptor for capsaicin , trpv1 [ 19 , 34 , 35 ] .
studies had shown that the activation of trpv1 is capable of inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cancer cell growth by cell cycle arrest in many different types of cancer , while normal cells remained unharmed [ 22 , 36 , 37 ] .
in order to examine whether the capsaicin - induced apoptotic effect was mediated by trpv1 , the trpv1 - specific antagonist sb - 705498 [ 28 ] was used and incubated with the cells before the capsaicin and smf treatments .
as a result , the enhanced anti - cancer effect was diminished by the trpv1 blocker .
hence , in this study , the synergistic effect could be due to that smf increased the binding efficiency of capsaicin for the trpv1 channel , thereby altering the activation kinetics and the downstream apoptotic pathways .
to further confirm that the trpv1 activity was indeed influenced by smf and capsaicin , we performed the calcium assay to measure the intracellular calcium levels after the treatments .
the results showed that capsaicin indeed activated the trpv1 channel .
interestingly , while smf alone did not influence the calcium concentration , smf and capsaicin synergistically increased the cytoplasmic calcium concentrations .
the results confirm the suggestion that trpv1 activity plays an important role in the smf enhanced anti - cancer effect .
many studies attempt to provide explanations for the enhancement effect caused by smf , however , as far as we know , the drug - specific phenomenon could not be explained satisfactorily .
thus , more studies will be necessary to elucidate the role of smf played on specific anti - cancer drugs .
previous study suggested that during moderate smf exposure , the reorientation of membrane phospholipids will result in the deformation of imbedded ion channels , and hence influences channel activations [ 38 ] .
besides , experimental data had shown that smf affected the trpv1 - modulated nociceptive processes [ 39 , 40 ] .
therefore , in this study , part of the mechanism by which smf affects capsaicin activity may involve a conformational change of trpv1 ion channel , possibly making it more available to capsaicin .
in other words , smf increases the probability of interaction between capsaicin and the transmembrane ion channel trpv1 and thus enhances the anti - cancer effect exhibited by capsaicin .
previous studies have shown that apoptosis is an important procedure for chemotherapeutic agents - induced tumor cell death [ 41 ] .
in our case , we found that capsaicin induced apoptosis in hepg2 cells , as evidenced by the flow cytometry result .
when the capsaicin - treated group was under smf exposure , the annexin v positive cells were further increased , indicating the efficacy of capsaicin was indeed enhanced by smf .
it has been postulated that apoptotic signal is regulated by two subgroups of pro - apoptotic proteins and anti - apoptotic proteins [ 42 ] .
for instance , the balance of the apoptosis - promoting protein bax and apoptosis - inhibiting protein bcl - 2 subtly controls the apoptotic signaling pathway by regulating mitochondrial function .
bax is a member of the bcl - 2 protein family and its expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 gene [ 43 ] .
in healthy cells , bax is located mostly in the cytosol , but upon initiation of apoptotic signaling , it undergoes a conformational change , and becomes more membrane - associated [ 44 ] .
basically , it can be realized from earlier studies that bax increases the mitochondrial membrane permeability by interacting with voltage - dependent ion channel [ 45 ] or forming oligomeric pores in mitochondrial outer membrane [ 46 ] .
this results in the release of cytochrome c and other apoptotic factors , and thus activates caspase - 9 which processes the main executioner caspase - 3 , finally reaching the " point of no return '' in apoptotic pathway [ 47 ] .
on the contrary , the apoptosis - inhibiting protein bcl - 2 provides survival signals to the cell .
studies have shown that the bax / bcl - 2 ratio is an important index which determines the susceptibility to apoptosis in cancer cells [ 25 ] .
in accordance with this , we found that capsaicin increased the bax / bcl - 2 ratio in hepg2 cells , indicating the apoptotic signal was induced .
it was also in agreement with the flow cytometry result showing increased population of apoptotic cells .
moreover , the bax / bcl - 2 ratio was further increased by smf exposure , which again revealed the assisted virtue of smf .
in this work , we also showed that the level of active caspase - 3 was increased in capsaicin - treated hepg2 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy .
caspase - 3 is considered to be the main executioner in the apoptotic process , once it is activated , the apoptotic process is at the point of no return [ 47 ] .
in the combinational treatment , our results demonstrated for the first time that smf significantly increased the capsaicin - induced caspase - 3 fluorescence intensity , which unambiguously confirms the anti - tumor efficacy of capsaicin can be enhanced by smf treatment .
in conclusion , we show that capsaicin and smf could synergistically inhibit hepg2 cancer cell growth through mitochondria - dependent apoptosis pathway .
the potency of capsaicin against cancer cells was significantly enhanced by smf .
the underlying mechanism could be due to that smf induces conformational change of trpv1 ion channel and facilitates the interaction between capsaicin and trpv1 channel , thus enhancing the anti - cancer effect exhibited by capsaicin .
this study yields important implications for the therapeutic usage of anti - cancer drugs in combination with smf , which opens new doors in the development of new strategies in fighting cancer with minimum cytotoxicity and side effects .
further studies are needed to understand the specific role smf played on anti - cancer drugs and to optimize smf parameters and appropriate drug combinations .

the nucleoside analogue ribavirin significantly increases patient response to ifn - alpha treatment of hcv , by directly inhibiting viral replication .
recent studies indicate that ribavirin also regulates immunity and we propose that ribavirin enhances specific interferon sensitive gene ( isg ) expression by amplifying the ifn - alpha - jak / stat pathway .
we found that ifn - alpha - induced stat1 and stat3 phosphorylation was increased in hepatocytes co - treated with ribavirin and ifn - alpha , compared to ifn - alpha alone .
ribavirin specifically enhanced ifn - alpha induced mrna and protein of the anti - viral mediator mxa , which co - localised with hcv core protein .
these novel findings indicate for the first time that ribavirin , in addition to its viral incorporation , also enhances ifn - alpha - jak / stat signalling , leading to a novel mxa - mediated immuno - modulatory mechanism that may enhance ifn - alpha anti - viral activity against hcv .
introduction in combination with the anti - viral cytokine interferon ( ifn ) - alpha , ribavirin is used to treat chronic hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection .
ribavirin lowers serum alanine aminotransferase levels of hcv infected patients [ 1 ] , reduces hcv rna levels [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , decreases patient relapse and more than doubles the sustained virological response ( svr ) obtained with ifn - alpha monotherapy [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] .
ribavirin ( 1 - beta - d - ribofuranosyl - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole - 3 - carboxamide ) is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside analogue , that directly inhibits viral replication by depleting guanosine pools upon inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase [ 7 ] , inhibiting hcv non - structural - 5b polymerase [ 8 ] and incorporating into the viral genome , leading to error catastrophe [ 9 ] .
however , in addition to its effect on viral replication , this nucleoside analogue is also thought to have immune modulatory properties , including the regulation of macrophage and t helper ( th ) cell produced cytokines , modulation of the th1 / th2 subset balance and the enhancement of ifn sensitive gene ( isg ) expression , suggesting an effect on the jak / stat pathway [ 10 ] - [ 15 ] .
anti - viral responses to ifn - alpha are mediated by a number of key proteins induced through activation of the jak / stat pathway , including double - stranded rna - activated protein kinase ( pkr ) and 2'5 ' - oligoadenylate synthethase ( 2'5 ' - oas ) , which block translation and degrade viral rna , respectively .
a third critical anti - viral protein is a dynamin - like large guanosine triphosphatase ( gtpase ) , myxovirus resistance gene a ( mxa ) , which is upregulated by ifn - alpha in many species [ 16 ] .
mx proteins were initially discovered in influenza a resistant mice and are thought to mediate innate immunity against numerous rna viruses , including hepatitis b [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
human mx proteins ( mxa and mxb ) are cytoplasmic and involved in vesicle trafficking via their association with the cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum .
in fact , this interaction is thought to mediate anti - viral activity by complexing with viral nucleocaspids and trafficking them to cellular locations for isolation or degradation [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] .
this effective anti - viral mechanism is clearly demonstrated in mxa over - expressing mice , which lack functional ifnalpha / beta receptors , but survive normally lethal viral infections despite the inability to mount ifn responses [ 22 ] .
since ribavirin mono - therapy does not clear hcv infection , but enhances patient response to ifn - alpha , an immuno - modulatory effect is likely , but remains poorly understood .
therefore , the aim of this study was to examine the effect of ribavirin on ifn - alpha intracellular signalling , in a bid to further elucidate its mechanism of action .
we found that ribavirin enhanced ifn - alpha - induced phosphorylation of stat1 and stat3 and mxa expression in huh7 hepatocytes , revealing a novel mechanism of immune regulation by ribavirin .
furthermore , hcv core protein co - localised with and enhanced mxa protein , implicating mxa as an important anti - viral mediator against hcv .
these results are the first to provide a novel insight into the immune modulatory mechanism used by ribavirin to enhance patient response to ifn - alpha and may reveal targets within the jak / stat pathway for enhancement of current therapy for hcv .

results ribavirin / ifn - alpha co - treatment increases stat activation since the addition of ribavirin to ifn - alpha treatment greatly increases hcv clearance , we wondered if ribavirin enhances ifn - alpha - mediated jak / stat signal transduction .
initially , we treated huh7 cells with ribavirin for 2 and 4 h alone ; ifn - alpha for 15 min alone and ribavirin pretreatment for 2 and 4 h , before 15 min ifn - alpha .
lysates were analysed for pstat1 , stat1 , pstat3 and stat3 protein expression by immunoblotting .
as expected , stat1 and stat3 phosphorylation occurred after the addition of ifn - alpha for 15 min .
while stimulation with ribavirin alone did not induce phosphorylation of stat1 or stat3 , ribavirin pretreatment amplified subsequent ifn - alpha - induced stat1 and stat3 phosphorylation ( fig. 1 ) .
this data demonstrates that ribavirin enhances ifn - alpha signal transduction in hepatocytes , which may reveal a mechanism by which ribavirin increases response to ifn - alpha therapy in hcv - infected patients .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0027866.g001 figure 1 ifn - alpha induced stat1 and stat3 phosphorylation is enhanced in the presence of ribavirin .
lysates from huh7 hepatocytes treated with ifn - alpha for 2 h , ribavirin for 2 h or both for 2 h were immunoblotted for pstat1 and 3 and reprobed for their protein counterparts and beta - actin loading control ( data representative of three independent experiments ) .
ribavirin specifically enhances induction of mxa mrna and protein having observed that ribavirin increased ifn - alpha - mediated stat1 and stat3 phosphorylation , we subsequently analysed the induction of downstream anti - viral isgs , including pkr , oas and mxa .
initially , we treated huh7 hepatocytes with ifn - alpha and ribavirin separately and together for 2 h , before analysing pkr , 2'5 ' - oas and mxa mrna expression by qrt - pcr .
to further determine ribavirin 's functional specificity , mrna levels of the chemokine cxcl10 were measured as a control , since it is strongly upregulated in response to ifn - alpha , but does not exhibit direct anti - viral activity like pkr , 2'5 ' - oas and mxa [ 25 ] .
ifn - alpha stimulation strongly induced isg mrna expression , while ribavirin alone had little effect on gene levels .
the addition of ribavirin alongside ifn - alpha led to a reduction in pkr , 2'5 ' - oas and cxcl10 mrna .
however , mxa message was potentiated by ribavirin / ifn - alpha co - stimulation ( fig. 2 ) .
these results indicate that ribavirin specifically enhances ifn - alpha induction of mxa mrna , via increased stat phosphorylation , revealing a novel insight into how these therapeutics increase anti - viral responses .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0027866.g002 figure 2 ribavirin treatment specifically enhances ifn - alpha - induced mxa mrna .
quantitative rt - pcr analysis of huh7 cells treated with ifn - alpha alone for 2 h , ribavirin alone for 2 h and rbv and ifn - alpha together for 2 h. stimulated values are relative to untreated which are normalized to one ( n = 4 ) .
since we found that a combination of ribavirin and ifn - alpha increased mxa mrna , we wondered whether protein levels were also affected .
therefore , we treated huh7 cells with ifn - alpha and ribavirin separately and together for 2 h , before lysates were harvested , immunoprecipitated for mxa and analysed by western blotting .
while mxa protein was constitutively present in huh7 s , the addition of ifn - alpha or ribavirin alone had no significant impact after 2 h. however , ribavirin / ifn - alpha co - treatment mirrored the previously observed mrna expression by increasing mxa protein levels ( fig. 3a ) .
to further explore the effect of ribavirin and ifn - alpha upon mxa protein expression , we treated huh7 hepatocytes with ifn - alpha and ribavirin as before and analysed mxa protein expression by confocal microscopy .
we found that ribavirin and ifn - alpha together visually increased cytoplasmic mxa protein levels ( fig. 3b ) , providing support for the mxa protein upregulation observed by immunoblotting ( fig. 3a ) .
these findings indicate that the addition of ribavirin to ifn - alpha treatment elevates hepatocyte mxa expression , which may have functional anti - viral consequences during treatment for hcv infection .

bar , 10 microm .
hcv core protein co - localises with mxa since these results suggest that mxa is an important anti - viral protein during ifn - alpha / ribavirin combination treatment and mxa is thought to bind viral core proteins , targeting them for endosomal isolation , we wondered if mxa also associated with hcv in this manner .
therefore , we initially transfected huh7 hepatocytes with the non - replicating pbrtm / hcv1 - 3011 dna construct over a 24 h time course to determine the optimal transfection time for hcv core protein expression .
we found that hcv core protein was strongly expressed within 12 h ( fig. 4a ) .
next , we transfected huh7 hepatocytes with a hcv - dna construct for 12 h and using confocal microscopy , we analysed the association of mxa with hcv .
mxa protein levels were increased upon expression of hcv proteins via the transfection of the hcv - dna construct , indicating a direct mxa - mediated anti - viral response to hcv protein expression .
furthermore , mxa co - localised in a cytoplasmic granular pattern with hcv core ( fig. 4a ) .
we also found that mxa co - localisation with hcv appeared more aggregated , rather than diffuse , upon co - treatment with ribavirin and ifn - alpha .
( fig. 4c ) , suggesting that ribavirin increases ifn - alpha - induced mxa expression , thus promoting directional localisation with hcv .
these results indicate that mxa targets hcv and suggest that ifn - alpha / ribavirin co - treatment may enhance this novel anti - viral process .

discussion ribavirin increases the response rate of hcv - infected patients to ifn - alpha therapy , through mechanisms that remain largely unknown , but are thought to reside in its structural similarity to the nucleosides adenosine and guanosine .
we found that ribavirin amplified ifn - alpha - induced stat1 and stat3 phosphorylation and that this combined treatment also increased mxa expression , but had no effect on pkr or 2'5 ' - oas , indicating that ribavirin amplification of jak / stat signalling specifically enhances the anti - viral protein mxa .
ribavirin has been shown to upregulate ifn - alpha receptor expression of hepatocytes [ 12 ] , perhaps providing a mechanism for our observed increase in ifn - alpha signal transduction and mxa expression .
interestingly , we observed that in hepatocytes transfected with an hcv - dna construct , mxa and hcv core protein co - localised in a granular pattern , which may resemble vacuole or endosomal encasement .
these findings outline a mechanism by which ribavirin may enhance anti - viral responses to ifn - alpha , and suggest that mxa may be fundamental in targeting hcv , thus explaining improved response of patients given ribavirin in combination with ifn - alpha .
in agreement with a previous study of chronic hcv infected human livers [ 26 ] , we found that the presence of hcv increased mxa expression in hepatocytes , suggesting that hcv acts either directly or via paracrine / autocrine induction of ifn - alpha to induce mxa .
even though mxa has been shown to block the replication of rna viruses , its exact effect on hcv is undetermined .
frese et al. , found that the hcv replicon was not affected by over - expression of mxa and dominant negative mxa did not block ifn - alpha responses [ 27 ] .
however , this study did not include ribavirin ; which , as our results suggest , is required for enhanced ifn - alpha signalling and mxa expression .
furthermore , mxa acts by targeting viruses to endosomal compartments for isolation or degradation , a process that may not lower observed levels of cellular hcv in vitro [ 16 ] .
indeed , our results show a granular pattern of hcv core : mxa in huh7 cells , possibly demonstrating this anti - viral mechanism in action .
in contrast , thomas et al. , found that ifn - alpha and ribavirin inhibit cell cultured hcv infection of huh7 cells and itsui et al. , found that over - expression of isgs , including mxa , significantly suppressed the hcv replicon , demonstrating mxa 's anti - viral activity against hcv [ 13 ] , [ 28 ]. with the imminent introduction of new protease inhibitors for the treatment of hcv , it was initially thought that ifn - alpha and ribavirin might become redundant .
however , the phase 2 study for telaprevir showed that a group of hcv - infected patients given telaprevir and ifn - alpha for 12 weeks had svr of 36 % , compared to 60 % svr of those who received telaprevir , ifn - alpha plus ribavirin [ 29 ] .
these data indicate that ribavirin will continue to be critical for improved patient response in these novel combination therapies .
together with our results , this suggests that the anti - viral action of protease inhibitors against hcv may further increase the positive effects of ribavirin upon ifn - alpha signalling , generating a high level of svr .
in conclusion , we show that ribavirin enhances ifn - alpha jak / stat signalling and have identified mxa as a key component of this anti - viral response , which is important in our understanding of how these therapeutics function and in the development of tailored , effective therapeutic care for hcv - infected patients .

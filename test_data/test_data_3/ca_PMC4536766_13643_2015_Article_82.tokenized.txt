background the purpose of this review is to study the effect of school - based interventions on smoking prevention for girls .
methods we performed a systematic review of articles published since 1992 on school - based tobacco - control interventions in controlled trials for smoking prevention among children .
we searched the databases of pubmed , embase , web of science , the cochrane databases , cinahl , social science abstracts , and psycinfo .
two reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion and quality and extracted data .
a pooled random - effects estimate was estimated of the overall relative risk .
results thirty - seven trials were included , of which 16 trials with 24,210 girls were included in the pooled analysis .
the overall pooled effect was a relative risk ( rr ) of 0.96 ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 0.86 - 1.08 ; i2 = 75 %) .
one study in which a school - based intervention was combined with a mass media intervention showed more promising results compared to only school - based prevention , and four studies with girl - specific interventions , that could not be included in the pooled analysis , reported statistically significant benefits for attitudes and intentions about smoking and quit rates .
conclusions there was no evidence that school - based smoking prevention programs have a significant effect on preventing adolescent girls from smoking .
combining school - based programs with mass media interventions , and developing girl - specific interventions , deserve additional study as potentially more effective interventions compared to school - based - only intervention programs .

keywords cigarette smoking prevention schools systematic review girls issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background worldwide , about 80 - 100,000 young people become addicted to tobacco every day [ 1 ] , and smoking behavior established during adolescence often becomes a lifelong habit .
in fact , 88 % of adult smokers who smoke daily report that they started smoking before the age of 18 [ 2 ] .
evidence supports that the motivation to start smoking at a young age differs between boys and girls .
in a european study with 4000 adolescents , girls experiencing higher social pressure to smoke from friends were more likely to start smoking , but it was not a significant factor for boys [ 3 ] .
girls who had a favorite movie star who smoked on - screen had a greater increase in smoking initiation during adolescence , yet this relationship was not as strong for boys [ 4 ] .
there is increasing evidence that the tobacco industry is focusing its efforts on the marketing of tobacco to women globally [ 5 ] by selling pink - colored cigarette packages that resemble perfume or lipstick boxes to make them attractive for girls .
industry analysts attributed the sharp increase of market share in 2007 of camel cigarettes to the innovative fashion - themed camel no .
9 marketing campaign aimed at young women that was launched in february 2007 [ 6 ] .
the tobacco industry 's successful use of gender - based marketing to promote smoking provides a strong rationale for investigating gender - specific approaches to preventing smoking .
helping children to not start smoking is a worldwide endorsed public health goal , and school - based programs are most commonly used to prevent smoking in children .
however , most school - based interventions target boys and girls in the same , universal program .
the world health organization framework convention on tobacco control ( who fctc ) acknowledges gender - specific risks and the need for gender - specific strategies for more effective tobacco control [ 7 ] .
in this systematic review , the authors focused on the effect of school - based interventions in smoking prevention for girls .
the primary aim of this review was to determine how effective school - based interventions are in preventing smoking in girls , and the secondary objective was to determine which interventions are most successful .
to answer these questions , studies were included that reported data on the effect of an intervention for girls , regardless of whether or not the intervention was girl - specific .
methods this study was part of a larger project that was a scoping review of interventions outside the doctor 's office designed to prevent smoking and promote smoking cessation in women and girls .
the study protocol is registered in prospero ( crd register 2012 : crd42012002322 ) [ 8 ] .
the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the scoping review are reported in the protocol but , in general , were very broad - based , aimed at identifying smoking prevention and cessation interventions delivered outside the clinician 's office .
there were few restrictions other than that publications had to be in the english language , published since 1992 , and did not include treatment within a clinician 's office or certain specialized environments such as addiction - treatment facilities .
the data were collected through 2015 and analyzed in 2015 .
data sources and searches we conducted a review of key terms related to smoking cessation from pubmed , embase , web of science , the cochrane databases in addition to the cinahl , social science abstracts , and psycinfo from 1 january 1992 to 22 january 2015 and included articles published only in english ( see additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
we excluded letters to editors and editorials .
study selection two reviewers ( mk and mf ) independently reviewed the titles , and any title selected by either reviewer was accepted to the next stage .
the two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full text articles against the inclusion and exclusion criteria using the distillersr software [ 9 ] and documented the reason for exclusion .
disagreements on inclusion were resolved by group consensus .
based on the combination of policy - relevance and the availability of controlled trials , the authors narrowed the focus for the meta - analysis to school - based interventions for children with outcome data on smoking behavior for girls .
hence the inclusion criteria were as follows : population , children ( less than 18 years of age at baseline ) at school ; intervention , any school - based tobacco - control intervention with the intention to prevent smoking or promote smoking cessation ; comparison , including studies comparing outcomes of intervention groups to controls ; design , trials ( randomized , other controlled trials ) and outcome : included studies that present smoking behavior results for girls .
smoking behavior was defined as changes in smoking behavior ( quit smoking , intention to quit , retention rates ) or intermediate outcome ( changes in knowledge or attitudes toward smoking , satisfaction or acceptance of the intervention ) .
data extraction and quality assessment for each study , we extracted the year , country where the study took place , funding source , age and ethnicity of the participants , study design , the number of participants , the intervention content , a description of the person or persons who delivered the intervention , the duration of the intervention , the duration of follow - up , and the smoking behavior outcome data .
smoking behavior at baseline was coded as nonsmoker or smoker ( daily , weekly , or monthly smoking ) .
for non - smokers , outcome data were coded as started smoking versus never started smoking for non - smokers and quit smoking or did not quit smoking for smokers .
we combined both outcomes when present , counting all smokers at follow - up ( including new smokers and continuing smokers ) .
we excluded studies that only reported intention to quit or intermediate outcomes from the pooled analysis .
the content or goals of the interventions were characterized into the following four categories : ( 1 ) gaining knowledge , ( 2 ) gaining more skills , ( 3 ) multiple strategies based at the school ( i.e. , quit - and - win contests , poster contests , displays , health fairs ) , and ( 4 ) multi - component programs ( the school program is part of a larger anti - smoking campaign strategy outside the school ) .
we developed this categorization prior to data extraction based on existing literature reviews on school - based prevention programs [ 10 - 12 ] .
ultimately , the different interventions aimed at gaining knowledge and / or gaining more skills were evaluated together ( additional file 2 : table s2 .
characteristics and results for interventions designed to gain knowledge and / or more skills ) , versus multiple strategy interventions that were only school - based ( additional file : 3 table s3 .
characteristics and results for school - based multiple strategy interventions ) and multi - component programs ( additional file 4 : table s4 .
characteristics and results of school - based interventions with multi - component programs ) .
the control group was defined as usual care when the control group received either no intervention ( or nothing was described for the control group ) , the standard health education curriculum , the tobacco education curriculum , or drug - abuse education curriculum normally used at the school , or a delayed intervention ( control group on a waiting list for the intervention ) .
data extraction was done independently in duplicate ( by mk and mf ) with adjudication in case of disagreement by a third author .
risk - of - bias ( quality ) assessment criteria for judging the risk of bias were used , adapted from van tulder 2003 [ 13 ] , boutron et al , 2005 ( clear npt ) [ 14 ] and the cochrane handbook of systematic reviews of interventions , chapter 8 ( version 5.1 , updated march 2011 ) [ 15 ] .
two authors ( mk and mf ) assessed four aspects of risk of bias , with adjudication in case of disagreement by a third author ( ps ) .
each potential risk of bias was assessed to be either at low risk , unclear risk ( if no or insufficient data were provided which could be judged to assess bias ) , or at high risk ( study design or execution could cause over or underestimation of the intervention effect ) for each of the following criteria : selection bias ( biased allocation to interventions ) due to inadequate generation of a randomized sequence ; selection bias due to dissimilarity between the intervention and control group at baseline ; detection bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors ; attrition bias due to amount , nature , or handling of incomplete outcome data ; and performance bias or fidelity .
data synthesis and analysis to be included in the pooled analysis , the number of girls within the intervention and control groups had to be reported .
also the number of new girl smokers at follow - up in the intervention and control groups had to be specified in order to calculate the relative risks .
in some studies , the number of non - smokers at baseline was not stated in the article .
given the age of this population , we assumed the smoking rate would be very low [ 16 , 17 ] and therefore set the baseline smoking rate to zero for these studies .
we also conducted sensitivity analyses by removing these two studies .
we calculated relative risks for each trial , intervention compared to the usual .
for trials that had more than one intervention group , we selected the one that had the largest published effect for the pooled analysis .
since randomization was usually done at the school or classroom level , we adjusted our results for clustering .
cluster adjustments are made by calculating the effective sample size for each trial and intervention group [ 18 ] .
the effect sample size is calculated by dividing the total sample size by the design effect .
the design effect takes into account the average cluster size and the intraclass correlation .
based on previous work done among measures of adolescent smoking , we used an intraclass correlation of 0.01 to calculate the design effect [ 19 ] .
a pooled random - effects estimate [ 20 ] was estimated of the overall relative risk , and we performed a test of heterogeneity using i2 [ 21 ] , where values of i2 close to 100 % represent high degrees of heterogeneity .
we used the begg rank correlation [ 22 ] and egger regression asymmetry test [ 23 ] to test for evidence of publication bias .
publication bias occurs when the publication of results depends on their direction and significance [ 24 ] .
effects of quality were assessed by testing for differences within each of the five risk - of - bias measures .
we used stata 12 to conduct all analyses [ 25 ] .
results description of included studies we reviewed 4924 titles from the electronic search and an additional 36 titles from occasional reference mining. of the 4960 titles , 197 studies met the inclusion criteria after a title , abstract , and full article review ( see fig. 1 ) .
after further review , 37 controlled trials described in 43 articles were included in our data synthesis [ 16 , 17 , 26 - 60 , 64 , 70 - 74 ] ; 26 randomized controlled trials and 11 other controlled trials ; including 45 intervention groups and 38 control groups ; giving a total of 83 arms , including girls from 20 different countries .
funding sources where all related to local or national governmental financing .
ethnicity was not reported in most articles .
full details of the included studies are shown in the evidence tables ( additional file 2 : table s2 , additional file 3 : table s3 , additional file 4 : table s4 ). fig. 1 literature flow nineteen study - arms had interventions focused on gaining knowledge and gaining more skills ( e.g. , peer - assisted learning , harm - minimization curriculum , take - charge - of - your - life program ) ; six arms focused on gaining knowledge ( e.g. , informational lessons , social normative interventions ) ; five arms focused on gaining more skills ( e.g. , refusal skills , life - skills training , good - behavior game ) ; five arms had interventions based on multiple strategies ( e.g. , smoke - free class competition , school smoking - free policies ) ; and ten arms had interventions consisting of multi - component programs ( school interventions combined with mass media ( anti - smoking advertisements ) and / or community activities , parental interventions ) .
only four studies included gender - specific interventions for girls [ 36 , 50 , 54 , 58 ] , while all others included the same intervention for boys and girls .
twenty - five studies had interventions mainly aimed at smoking prevention and / or cessation .
in ten studies , the intervention was aimed at the prevention or reduction of substance abuse in general , whereas one study was aimed at good health [ 54 ] and one study at prevention of disruptive behavior [ 16 ] .
most trials were comparisons of an intervention group to a control group that received usual care ( 23 studies ) , and in two studies , the control group received a delayed intervention .
in one study , the control group received the standard health education curriculum , and in four studies , the control group received the tobacco - or drug - abuse education curriculum normally used at the school , and in four studies , other activities took place .
in three studies , two different interventions were compared to each other , and the school - based intervention was the same for the intervention and the control group [ 50 , 51 , 56 ] .
interventions were performed mostly by teachers , peers , coaches , and sometimes , parents or trainers outside the school were involved .
description of the excluded studies one hundred thirty - seven studies were excluded that were not school - based or the participants where aged 18 or older ( fig. 1 ). of the 60 articles that went on to detailed abstraction , one study was excluded because it was based on a special population [ 61 ] , and two studies were excluded because there was no outcome reported on smoking behavior [ 62 , 63 ] .
study designs that were not trials were excluded ( n = 20 ) .
effectiveness of the intervention in the first category , interventions on gaining knowledge and / or gaining more skills ( additional file 2 : table s2 ) , only one study showed significant positive results for the intervention for girls .
this was a controlled trial [ 49 ] from australia with 122 girls who were randomized to either a peer - led smoking - education program , a teacher - led smoking - education program , or a control group that received no intervention .
the girls in the teacher - led program showed significant decreased risk of smoking after a seven - year follow - up ( rr = 0.57 ; 95 % ci ; 0.33 - 0.99 ) compared to girls in the control group .
there was also one study showing a significant negative effect of the intervention - - indicating that the control group was more effective in preventing smoking ; it was a randomized clinical trial ( rct ) [ 17 ] from the usa with a two - year school - based substance - abuse prevention program delivered by police officers to children .
data were analyzed from the five - year follow - up on 5814 girls and found a significantly higher risk of smoking for girls in the intervention group ( rr = 1.3 ; 95 % ci ; 1.21 - 1.41 ) compared to girls who received no intervention .
no studies reported a significant effect for girls for school - based interventions with multiple strategies ( additional file 3 : table s3 ) .
in the third category , studies that included multi - component interventions ( additional file 4 : table s4 ) , two studies had relative risks below 1 , but the differences were not statistically significant [ 46 , 47 ] .
one of these , the ariza et al. study , was a non - randomized controlled trial [ 47 ] with 575 girls from spain .
the school - based intervention consisted of the following three components : teacher - led lessons in year 1 and booster lessons in years 2 and 3 , reinforcement of a smoke - free school policy with teacher training , and a community intervention targeting parents , leisure - time supervisors , sports organizations , and coaches .
the control group did not receive any intervention .
although the relative risk for the intervention versus control was 0.82 at 3 - year follow - up , the effect was not statistically significant ( 95 % ci ; 0.64 - 1.03 ) .
the vartiainen et al .
[ 46 ] study enrolled 1279 girls in a randomized controlled trial that included 14 information lessons about smoking and refusal skills training over a three - year period , and smoking prevention was integrated into regular subjects ( e.g. , math , finnish , geography ) .
students hung up self - made anti - smoking posters , received newsletters where young people described their ways of refusing smoking , and were invited to participate in no - smoking competitions .
the community - element of the program included parish confirmation camps , parents , and dentists .
the schools in the control group received the standard health education curriculum .
the risk ratio for the girls in the intervention group was 0.91 but not statistically significant ( 95 % ci ; 0.82 - 1.00 ) .
two other multi - component studies [ 51 ] where excluded from the pooled analysis because the control group did not receive usual care .
the first study [ 16 ] presented data on 10,170 girls from four different cities in the usa who received a 4 - year school - based prevention curriculum with or without a mass media campaign .
at the 5 - year follow - up , the relative risk for girls to start smoking in the mass media group was 0.74 ( 95 % ci ; 0.47 - 1.18 ) compared to those who only received the school - based prevention curriculum .
the other study was a controlled trial among 1266 girls age 9 to 12 with a 4 - year multi - component program including a mass media component and a school smoking - prevention program targeted primarily at girls .
at the 6 - year follow - up , the relative risk for girls to start smoking in the mass media group was 0.56 ( 95 % ci ; 0.33 - 0.96 ) compared to the school - based prevention curriculum only .
pooled analysis twenty - one studies were excluded from the pooled analysis for the following reasons : the outcome of interest ( percent of starters ) was not reported ( eight studies ) [ 28 , 29 , 36 , 45 , 54 , 57 - 59 ] , the data was not reported by gender ( five studies ) [ 27 , 30 , 39 , 53 , 60 ] , the data was not in a usable format - - the number of girls who started smoking was not reported by intervention group ( six studies ) [ 32 , 34 , 35 , 42 , 52 , 56 ] , or they compared a mass media intervention combined with school intervention versus a school intervention alone , so their control group was not usual care ( two studies ) [ 50 , 51 ] .
therefore , of the 37 included studies ( described in 43 articles ) , 16 were analyzed in the pooled analysis [ 16 , 17 , 26 , 31 , 33 , 37 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 44 , 46 - 49 , 55 ] ( see fig. 2. pooled analysis ) including data on 24,210 girls. fig. 2 pooled analysis in fig. 3 ( risk of bias ) the risk of bias of all 37 studies is presented .
regarding risk of bias , all included studies in the pooled analysis except one [ 31 ] were judged to be at high risk of detection bias ( due to the use of self - report of smoking status as the outcome ) , and all except three [ 27 , 30 , 31 ] were judged to be at low risk for bias due to group similarity at baseline and compliance .
thirty - two studies were judged to be high or unclear risk of bias due to the sequence generation and twenty - one studies were judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data. fig. 3 risk of bias the percentage of girls smoking in the control group at the end of follow - up varied widely from 3 % [ 40 , 44 ] to 77 % [ 46 ] in the studies included in the pooled analysis .
two of the 16 studies included in the pooled analysis ( fig. 2 ) had statistically significant differences between groups , one favoring the intervention [ 49 ] and the other favoring usual care [ 17 ] .
the overall pooled effect was a rr = 0.96 ( 95 % ci ; 0.86 - 1.108 ; i2 = 75 %) .
there was no indication of publication bias ( begg 's p = 0.558 and egger 's p = 0.111 ) .
testing for differences in effect based on quality / risk of bias was done , and no effect was found .
we imputed the baseline sample size for two studies that did not specify the number of non - smokers at baseline ; we set the number of smokers at baseline to be zero .
results of the sensitivity analysis that excluded those studies with imputed baseline rate yielded a slightly lower relative risk and a more narrow confidence interval ( pooled rr = 0.94 , 95 % ci ; 0.88 - 1.00 ; i2 = 6.0 %) than the pooled analyses with all 16 studies. of the 37 studies included , only four studies had gender - specific interventions for girls [ 36 , 50 , 54 , 58 ] , but then had to be excluded from the pooled analysis .
three of these gender - specific studies were excluded because the outcome of interest ( smoking behavior ) was not reported [ 36 , 54 , 58 ] .
the fourth study was excluded because the control group received an intervention as well , so the intervention could not be compared to usual care [ 50 ] .
however , all four of these gender - specific studies individually reported statistically significant positive effects .
in the first study , 40 sport teams from 18 high schools based in two states ( usa ) including 928 girls were enrolled. of these , 457 girls received the intervention called " athena " : athletes targeting health exercise and nutrition alternative .
the sports - coach and peers delivered the intervention in eight weekly 45 - minute sessions that were incorporated into a team 's usual practice activities .
ten weeks after the start of the program , girls in the intervention group were less likely to report intentions toward future tobacco use than girls in the control group , and this difference was statistical significant ( p < 0.05 ) [ 54 ] .
in the second study , 91 girls from two high schools in new york , usa , received either a gender - specific individual computer intervention based on stress reduction or a group - based gender - neutral conventional substance - abuse prevention program .
two weeks after the intervention , girls who received the gender - specific intervention reported lower approval of cigarettes ( p < 0.04 ) , a lower likelihood of cigarette use if asked to do so by a best friend ( p < 0.038 ) , and stronger plans to avoid cigarettes in the next year ( p < 0.046 ) , than girls who received the conventional intervention [ 36 ] .
in the third study , 5448 students were included from two matched pair communities in metropolitan areas in the usa .
within each matched pair , one community received a 4 - year school - based intervention while the other received a mass media campaign along with the school - based intervention .
the mass media campaign was especially focused on high - risk girls .
six years after the start of the study , the number of girls that had started smoking in the mass media group was lower than in the school - based intervention only group ( a rr of 0.56 was calculated ; 95 % ci ; 0.33 - 0.96 ) [ 50 ] .
in the fourth study [ 58 ] , 188 girls received the not - on - tobacco intervention in ten 50 - minute sessions over 10 weeks .
the intervention was delivered in same - gender groups by same - gender facilitators , and the matched control schools were given only a brief intervention equal to a normal school curriculum on tobacco .
at the seven - month follow - up , the quit rate for girls in the intervention group was almost four times higher than for the control group , and this difference was statistically significant ( p = 0.043 ) [ 64 ] .
discussion in this systematic literature review , we examined the effect of school - based smoking - prevention interventions for girls .
the pooled results of 16 studies provided no evidence of an effect ( rr = 0.96 ) of the school - based interventions on smoking behavior outcomes for girls .
however , the 95 % ci ( 0.86 - 1.08 ) does not exclude a modest - sized effect in magnitude similar to other smoking - control interventions [ 65 ] .
there is a signal that interventions that include a mass media component may be more effective than school - based interventions alone ; one study comparing a school - based intervention with a multi - component program showed a strong effect of the added mass media components [ 50 ] .
mass media interventions combined with school - based interventions are probably modifying the effect of the school - based intervention .
the only study that showed a significant effect [ 49 ] was a study among grade 7 students ( age 12 - 13 ) from australia , an age at which children and especially girls are highly influenced by peers [ 66 ] .
given that most of the studies included in this pooled analysis included a high percentage of smoking girls in the control group at follow - up , interventions with a small effect are clinically relevant with such high percentages of smoking girls. with the high percentages of smokers in a large part of the western world and the rapidly increasing smoking rates in parts of the eastern world , modest intervention effects for smoking prevention and cessation could have a serious impact globally .
gender - specific interventions the literature on specific factors that influence a girl 's motivation to start smoking like social pressure and the influence of role models [ 3 , 4 ] provide support that gender - specific interventions could be more effective than gender - neutral interventions at reducing smoking in girls .
the four studies of girl - specific interventions [ 36 , 50 , 54 , 58 ] that were identified , although limited in terms of either sample size , outcome measures , timing of the outcome , or the comparison group , provide some support for this .
the amount to which girls are influenced by social pressure , movie stars , and the tobacco industry marketing also support that multi - component interventions with a mass media component could be more effective in girls compared to only school - based interventions .
there were not enough multi - component interventions , and the number of included girls in these interventions was too small to adequately address this potential effect .
results of other reviews in this field a recent cochrane review [ 12 ] on school - based interventions concluded that there was an effect of smoking - prevention interventions for all children only when follow - up was greater than one year ( or = 0.52 ; 95 % ci ; 0.30 - 0.88 ) .
the authors also looked at the effects by gender and found no statistically significant effects of the intervention for females ( or = 0.82 ; 95 % ci ; 0.67 - 1.00 ) after a follow - up greater than one year .
for a shorter follow - up ( up to one year ) they did find a modest effect ( or = 0.69 ; 95 % ci ; 0.49 - 0.96 ) in girls .
this result is in line with the results of the review .
more studies were included in this pooled analysis [ 15 ] compared to the cochrane review [ 7 ] .
the five important differences between this review and the cochrane review were [ 1 ] the scope of the review ( cochrane general scope with a subset analysis , this review scoped only girls ) [ 2 ] , publication date of the studies ( studies published before 1992 were excluded in this review ) [ 3 ] , the stratification of follow - up time in up to one year and longer than one year ( cochrane ) [ 4 ] , the exclusion of studies without the number of non - smoking girls at baseline ( cochrane ) [ 5 ] , and the inclusion of non - randomized trials ( cochrane - only rct ) .
therefore , our review adds evidence to the cochrane review , which only included a limited number of randomized studies .
in another review of community interventions [ 67 ] , most of the 25 trials combined the intervention with school - based interventions .
nine studies showed a significant long - term effect of the interventions , with two trials showing an intervention that was only effective in boys .
in another review on the effectiveness of mass media campaigns in young people , three out of seven studies concluded that mass media interventions reduced the smoking behavior of young people [ 68 ] .
one of the three studies was a media campaign aimed primarily at girls and found that the increase in the proportion of females smoking was significantly lower ( 8.6 %) in the intervention county than in the control county ( 12.4 %) .
limitations of this review this systematic review had several limitations .
only studies in which data on girls were included were presented .
out of the 37 studies , 11 studies had to be excluded because of missing or insufficient data on girls .
this may have introduced presentation bias if authors were more likely to report the results by gender if such differences were actually seen .
given the overall ineffectiveness of the interventions , such bias , if present , would likely be small .
in most studies , we considered the risk of detection bias as high , because of the self - report of smoking behavior .
however , a recent study found that the validity of self - report in a large population including adolescents was high , with a sensitivity of 90 % [ 69 ] , indicating that detection bias may not be a large risk .
attrition bias is a real problem in the studies , especially in studies with a long follow - up time .
longer follow - up often means higher attrition , and this most likely leads to overestimation of the effect due to the higher attrition of smokers compared to non - smokers .
there was no difference in effect between the studies with a high or unclear risk and the studies with a low risk of attrition bias .
our search was limited to articles published in english .
we also limited our search to articles from 1992 and onwards because sociological phenomena like smoking behavior change over time , and we judged that data from studies published before 1992 would be less relevant for today .
the decision to focus this review on school - based interventions in the second stage of the search , and the difficulty in using well - defined search terms for this review , could have resulted in missing school - based studies that did not focus on girls specifically .
however , our search should have captured most studies that identified gender - specific results .
we did not search for ongoing studies through online clinical trial registries or contact authors for this review .
when the percentage of smokers is low , it is less likely that an intervention shows a significant effect in reducing smoking rates .
in the pooled analysis , only three studies were included with a low percentage (< 5 %) of smokers in the control group at the end of follow - up ( see fig. 2 ) .
therefore it is not likely that the result was due to a low baseline risk of smoking in the included studies .
the control group in the included studies was not well described in most studies , or consisted of a usual tobacco or health education curriculum .
therefore , it is not possible to know if there was enough contrast in the programs delivered to the control and intervention groups , which perhaps partially explains why there was no significant result of the interventions .
an additional limitation is that we grouped together studies that included smoking prevention as one part of a substance - use program with studies that were focused solely on smoking prevention .
it may be that focused studies will show more benefit ; although , we did not find evidence of that in our review .
in studies that included more than one active intervention arm , we analyzed the comparison that had the greatest effect in the pooled analysis .
this approach is described in the cochrane handbook as a way to overcome a unit - of - analysis error , and the resulting bias will be toward showing a greater effect .
our results show " no effect " ; therefore , the substitution of any of the other active intervention arms would only lessen the effect .
an additional limitation is the degree of heterogeneity among studies , which means that pooled results should be interpreted with caution .
part of the reason of this heterogeneity could be the pooling of studies reporting " smoking behavior " in a variety of different ways .
conclusions in summary , in a systematic review of the literature and meta - analysis , no evidence was found that gender - neutral school - based smoking - prevention programs have a significant effect on preventing teen - aged girls from smoking , although we could not exclude a modest effect due to the large confidence intervals .
a modest effect could still be of potential public health significance .
we urge researchers in this field to routinely report the effect of the intervention for boys and girls of gender - neutral smoking - prevention interventions so we can sharpen these estimates .
we found a signal that suggests that adding mass media campaigns to gender - neutral school - based interventions might increase their effectiveness , pointing to a need for future research in these areas .
lastly , a few studies suggest that it may be a more successful strategy to develop girl - specific interventions that target the reasons on why girls start smoking .

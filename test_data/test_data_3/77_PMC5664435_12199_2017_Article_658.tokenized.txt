background stepfamilies remain poorly understood in japanese society , and the support needs of stepfamily mothers are unclear .
this study aimed to identify characteristics of stepfamilies and maternal mental health as compared with non - stepfamilies in japan to utilize as a primary resource for providing effective support through community - based health care for stepfamilies .
methods from december 2011 to july 2012 , we conducted this questionnaire survey with mothers at 3 - and 4 - month checkups for infants .
the response rate was 75.1 % .
the sample for analysis included responses of 2246 mothers , excluding single mothers .
results respondents comprised 47 ( 2.1 %) stepfamilies and 2199 ( 97.9 %) non - stepfamilies .
there were significantly higher rates of parents with not more than a high school education and >= 3 children among stepfamilies compared with non - stepfamilies .
stepfamily mothers had significantly higher rates of feeling a lack of economic resources , absence of participation in childbirth education classes , smoking during pregnancy , and unplanned pregnancy .
furthermore , they also had significantly higher rates of depression and a lack of confidence in the parent role .
maternal depression was associated with factors such as maternal age , self - perceived health , stress level , confidence in breastfeeding , confidence in the parent role , and number of children .
conclusions these findings suggest that stepfamilies exhibit many characteristics related to social disadvantage and problems with community - based health care in japan .
healthcare providers should be aware of stepfamily mothers' support needs and should put in place a support system for stepfamilies .
moreover , compared with non - stepfamily mothers , stepfamily mothers have a significantly higher prevalence of depression .
however , stepfamily composition does not necessarily increase the risk of maternal depression .
therefore , healthcare providers should put in place a system for obtaining more thorough information about stepfamilies and conduct an early assessment to identify their support needs .
keywords stepfamily mother depression issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background according to the ministry of health , labour and welfare [ 1 ] , japan had 222,107 divorces , with an incidence rate of 1.77 per 1000 population .
the divorce rate in japan is still lower than that in western countries but has trended upward since the 1990s .
in addition , 58.4 % of these divorces involved dependent children .
whereas approximately 120,000 children experienced a parental divorce in 1975 , approximately 220,000 did so in 2014 .
since the latter half of the 1990s , every year more than 200,000 children experienced a parental divorce in japan [ 1 ] .
meanwhile , the rate of remarriage has increased along with japan 's increasing divorce rate .
in 1975 , 12.7 % of marriages involved at least one partner who had been married previously compared with 26.4 % in 2014 [ 1 ] .
therefore , approximately one out of every four new marriages is remarriages , giving rise to various family forms , such as stepfamilies , as seen in japan today .
ganong and coleman broadly defined a stepfamily as a family " in which at least one of the adults has a child ( or children ) from a previous relationship " [ 2 ] .
however , although many stepfamilies are formed after the remarriage of one or both partners , that is not always the case [ 3 ] .
we must also emphasize that stepfamily membership is not necessarily confined to those who are in the same household [ 2 ] .
in the usa , the stepfamily was actualized socially after the 1970s when divorce and remarriage had increased and stepfamily research drastically increased after the 1980s [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] .
in contrast , the stepfamily in japan has received little attention socially and academically until recently [ 6 ] .
however , stepfamily research in japan has increased since 2000 .
several studies on stepparents and biological parents have shown that difficulties during the family formation process can easily occur in stepfamilies , and particularly for stepmothers , who experience higher stress levels [ 5 - 8 ] .
these findings accord with stepfamily research in western societies [ 9 - 11 ] .
in addition , several studies have shown that residing in a stepfamily is a risk factor for child abuse [ 12 , 13 ] .
although these findings suggest the need to support mothers in stepfamilies , japanese society has a poor understanding of the stepfamily , and even the need for support is not yet recognized [ 8 ] .
furthermore , no clear academic distinction has been drawn between stepfamilies and non - stepfamilies ( i.e. , families with both biological parents ) , and there are no population - based studies on stepfamilies .
as a result , the support needs of stepfamily mothers remain unclear .
against this background , the purpose of this study was to identify characteristics of stepfamilies and maternal mental health as compared with non - stepfamilies .
this information can be used as a primary resource for providing effective support through community - based health care for stepfamilies .
methods study participants this questionnaire survey was conducted with 3008 mothers at 3 - and 4 - month health checkups for infants in city a from december 2011 to july 2012 .
city a is located in an urban area composed of a residential community of around 480,000 people with yearly birth numbers of approximately 4500 .
the consultation rate for 3 - and 4 - month health checkups in city a is approximately 98 % .
participants were 2258 mothers ( response rate , 75.1 %) .
we excluded 12 single parents from the analysis based on reports that single parents have a higher risk of mental health problems and life difficulties , including a high poverty rate [ 14 , 15 ] .
therefore , the sample for analysis included responses of 2246 mothers .
we clearly informed participants in writing that their participation in the study was voluntary , that no disadvantage would occur if they did not cooperate with the study , and that the return of the anonymous self - administered questionnaire would be taken as consent to participate in the study .
the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of osaka city university .
survey content we adopted ganong and coleman 's broad definition of stepfamilies [ 2 ] , which does not limit them to marriage and does not necessarily confine stepfamily membership to those who are in the same household. whether someone was part of a stepfamily or not was assessed with the question " is your family a stepfamily ?
( a stepfamily means a family that includes a non - related parent - child relationship by remarriage or other such relation )." in addition , for any stepfamily , we asked how long the current partners had lived together .
other survey items were basic personal parental information ( age , educational attainment level , employment status ) ; current family information ( family structure , number of children , age of children , presence or absence of any disorder in children ) ; family 's financial situation , maternal pregnancy situation , and childbirth situation ( presence or absence of participation in a childbirth education course , smoking status during pregnancy , planned or unplanned pregnancy , presence or absence of complicated birth ) ; and the child 's situation at childbirth ( gestational age at birth , birth weight ) .
in addition , we examined maternal self - perceived health and maternal mental health ( depression , stress level ) and factors affecting maternal mental health , including views on child care ( confidence in child care , confidence in breastfeeding , confidence in parent role , recognition of child maltreatment ) and support from the current partner and family environment ( marital relations , support from family environment ) .
to measure maternal depression , we used the edinburgh postnatal depression scale ( epds ) by cox et al .
[ 16 ] .
the epds is one of the most widely used self - report instruments for screening postpartum depression .
the 10 - item epds provides quantitative assessment of postpartum depression , with total scores ranging from 0 to 30 points .
in japan , scores over 9 points indicate postpartum depression [ 17 ] .
cronbach 's alpha was 0.79 .
we measured stress level using the semantic differential method [ 18 ] , a widely used graphical rating scale that measures the connotative meaning that concepts and objects evoke in individuals .
in this study , respondents were asked to mark the most appropriate point on a line , which had bipolar answers " strongly disagree " and " strongly agree " at the ends .
we then scored respondents' marks from 0 to 10 , with higher scores indicating higher reported levels of stress ( hereinafter called " stress score ") .
maternal self - perceived health was measured on a 6 - point scale (" very good " to " poor ") .
we measured childcare confidence , confidence in breast feeding , and confidence in the parent role by assessing the following statements on a 4 - point scale (" agree " to " strongly disagree ") : " i can take care of my child ," " i can breastfeed my child as i expect ," and " i fulfill the parent role well ," respectively .
for recognition of child maltreatment , we asked respondents , " have you ever wondered whether you might mistreat your child ?" those who answered " yes " were considered persons recognized to be potential perpetrators of child maltreatment .
to measure marital relations , we used the marital love scale by sugawara et al .
[ 19 ] .
this 10 - item self - report instrument has confirmed reliability and validity for assessing love relations between couples .
total scores range from 10 to 70 points , with higher scores indicating higher levels of intimacy of a couple .
cronbach 's alpha was 0.79 ( hereinafter called " marital relations score ") .
to assess childcare support in the family environment , we assessed the statement " i have childcare available when i need it " on a 4 - point scale ( agree to strongly disagree ) .
to assess financial situation , we examined maternal self - perceived capability by assessing the statement " my family is financially capable " on a 4 - point scale ( agree to strongly disagree ) .
statistical analysis we investigated independence of qualitative variables using the chi - squared test or fisher 's exact probability test and analyzed the significance of differences between means using the t test .
if a quantitative variable was non - normally distributed , we used the mann - whitney u test .
additionally , to reveal factors associated with maternal depression , we performed forced - entry multiple logistic regression analysis with maternal depression as the dependent variable .
independent variables were presence or absence of stepfamily , as well as factors associated with postpartum depression that were pointed out in previous studies [ 20 , 21 ] ( age , maternal self - perceived health , stress scores , confidence in breastfeeding , confidence in parent role , marital relations scores , recognition of support from the family environment , planned or unplanned pregnancy , presence or absence of complicated birth , and recognition of financial capability , mother 's educational attainment level , and number of children ) .
for all analyses , we considered p < 0.05 to indicate statistical significance .
all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss ver .
22.0 for windows ( japanese ibm corporation , tokyo , japan ) .
results this study included 47 ( 2.1 %) stepfamilies and 2199 ( 97.9 %) non - stepfamilies .
in stepfamilies , the mean ( sd ) living - together period with the current partner was 4.0 ( 3.0 ) years ( range , 10 months to 12 years ) .
table 1 summarizes the comparison of basic personal parental information between stepfamilies and non - stepfamilies .
the mean ( sd ) age of stepfamily mothers and non - stepfamily mothers was 32.6 ( 6.0 ) years ( range , 21 - 43 years ) and 32.4 ( 4.6 ) years ( range , 18 - 47 years ) , respectively .
the mean ( sd ) age of stepfamily fathers and non - stepfamily fathers was 34.4 ( 6.7 ) years ( range , 22 - 50 years ) and 34.1 ( 5.5 ) years ( range , 18 - 61 years ) , respectively .
the rate of parents with not more than a high school education was significantly higher among stepfamilies ( 66.0 % of mothers , 59.1 % of fathers ) than among non - stepfamilies ( 15.1 % of mothers , 20.3 % of fathers ) .

as for family financial situation , we observed a significantly higher rate of feeling a lack of economic security ( feeling financially well off ) among stepfamily mothers ( 60.9 %) than among non - stepfamily mothers ( 40.3 %) .

being in a stepfamily was not associated with maternal depression .
however , maternal age was independently associated with maternal depression , with an odds ratio of 0.94 for every 1 - year increase in maternal age .
maternal self - perceived health was also associated with maternal depression and so was poor maternal health , where the odds ratio indicated that mothers in poor health were 2.36 times more likely to be depressed than mothers who were not .
stress level was associated with maternal depression , with an odds ratio of 1.67 for every 1 - point increase in stress level .
lacking confidence in breastfeeding was associated with maternal depression , with mothers without confidence in breastfeeding 1.83 times more likely to be depressed than mothers with confidence in breastfeeding .
moreover , confidence in the parent role was associated with maternal depression , with mothers who felt a lack of confidence in the parent role 2.49 times more likely to be depressed than mothers who felt confident in the parent role .
in addition , number of children was associated with maternal depression , with mothers who had two children being 0.63 times more likely to be depressed than mothers who had one child .

currently , japan has no official statistical report on stepfamilies for comparison to determine if our result is larger or smaller than average .
according to the 2014 marriage and divorce statistics , 26.4 % of marriages between heterosexual couples who married in that year were remarriages .
however , the percentage of remarriages with children was unclear .
therefore , we cannot estimate the percentage of stepfamily marriages .
on the other hand , nishimura [ 7 ] reported a 1.8 % rate of stepfamilies or their functional equivalents .
inaba [ 22 ] also reported a 3.6 % rate of stepfamilies or their equivalents .
these reported rates are similar to the 2 % rate found in the present study .
in fact , some have argued that stepfamilies are less socially recognized in japan due to their relatively small numbers [ 5 ] .
findings in our study also indicate that the stepfamily appears to be a family form in the minority .
our results also identified multifaceted characteristics of stepfamilies .
as for basic personal parental information , more parents in stepfamilies , including both mothers and fathers , appear to have not more than a high school education ( approximately 60 %) compared to parents in non - stepfamilies .
this finding of lower parental educational attainment in stepfamilies is consistent with results of yoda [ 23 ] , who investigated associations between family structure and child educational expectations .
as for family and financial situations , the rate of families with >= 3 children was higher among stepfamilies ( over 50 %) than among non - stepfamilies .
the rate of families with a first child aged >= 5 years in stepfamilies exceeded 70 % , which greatly surpassed the 14.2 % rate in non - stepfamilies .
having many children in a household will have a considerable impact on household finances [ 24 ] .
educational costs can also become a more serious concern , particularly with respect to older children .
in this study , the rate of mothers who felt they lacked economic resources exceeded 60 % in stepfamilies , surpassing the 40 % rate in non - stepfamily mothers .
low levels of educational attainment among children in stepfamilies have recently been reported in japan [ 22 ] , which is consistent with findings reported elsewhere [ 2 ] .
thus , financial support for stepfamilies should be considered in child welfare policymaking .
in regard to prenatal maternal and child health , approximately 60 % of stepfamily mothers had never participated in childbirth education classes , a much higher rate of non - participation than that of non - stepfamily mothers ( about 20 %) .
further studies are needed to investigate the factors responsible for this low participation rate among stepfamily mothers .
our results suggest that stepfamily mothers did not receive adequate health guidance at medical institutions or local public health institutes during pregnancy .
whereas only 2.4 % of non - stepfamily mothers reported having smoked during pregnancy , 19.6 % of stepfamily mothers did so , which is more than eight times the rate of their counterparts .
studies in western countries have reported that smoking during pregnancy is associated with poverty , lower educational attainment , and social disadvantages such as single parenthood [ 25 ] .
the present study also found significantly higher rates of inadequate economic resources and lower educational attainment among stepfamily mothers relative to non - stepfamily mothers .
studies outside japan have reported more smokers among grown children of stepfamily origin than among children of intact families with both birth parents , which were attributed to a higher rate of parental smoking [ 26 ] .
thus , stepfamily mothers who smoke during pregnancy should receive appropriate anti - smoking guidance , to protect not only maternal health but also children 's health throughout their lifetime .
given the stepfamily mothers' low participation in childbirth education classes in our study , individualized approaches might be needed .
to that end , changes in certain systems in maternal and child health services might be needed , such as including an optional question on the application form of the mother and child health handbook that allows stepfamily mothers to safely report their stepfamily status in a way that maintains confidentiality and privacy .
whereas about 30 % of non - stepfamily mothers in this study reported that their latest pregnancy was unplanned , over 50 % of stepfamily mothers did so. unplanned pregnancies raise the risk of unwanted pregnancies , which should be an alert with respect to potential child maltreatment protection [ 13 , 27 ] .
in the event that an unwanted pregnancy is revealed during an individual - approach session with a stepfamily mother , continuous support after childbirth should be provided , and it might be prudent to monitor her childcare situation as well .
mental health of stepfamily mothers results of this study show that the prevalence of depression among stepfamily mothers is high , about twice that among non - stepfamily mothers .
in this study , maternal depression was associated with factors including young age , poor self - perceived health , high stress level , low confidence in breastfeeding , a lack of confidence in the parent role , and number of children .
number of children is considered to be related to the birth experience , and compared with the first childbirth , the second childbirth was associated with lower risk of maternal depression .
these findings are consistent with previous studies [ 20 , 21 ] .
in a study on postpartum mental health , tamaki [ 28 ] reported that among factors related to maternal depression , low self - evaluation of the mother role along with low self - esteem were most strongly associated with depressive symptoms .
in this study , one of three stepfamily mothers felt they did not adequately fulfill the parent role , and compared to non - stepfamily mothers , more stepfamily mothers lacked confidence in themselves as a parent .
the high rate of low self - confidence in the parent role can be considered a backdrop to the high prevalence of depression among stepfamily mothers .
results of logistic regression analysis did not show an association between stepfamily status and maternal depression , which suggests that stepfamily composition does not necessarily increase the risk of maternal depression .
studies on stepfamilies living overseas have found that stepmothers are more likely to have high rates of depressive symptoms compared to mothers with children of their own [ 10 ] .
maternal depression is a widely recognized risk factor for child abuse both domestically and internationally [ 12 , 13 , 27 ] , and its deleterious effects on children 's psychological and behavioral development are often reported [ 29 ] .
based on previous studies , women with depression that continues a year after childbirth are likely to have entered a depressed state earlier in the postpartum period [ 30 ] .
therefore , public health nurses or other professionals should conduct an assessment to identify support needs of stepfamily mothers early in the period .
to this end , building a trusting relationship with stepfamily mothers should take place through individual guidance sessions during pregnancy .
due to unavoidably complex parent roles in stepfamilies , particularly for stepmothers , previous research reported difficulty in playing a stepparent role and building a stepparent - child relationship [ 2 ] , which is partially attributable to excessive gender role expectations based on norms of motherly love [ 8 , 19 ] .
in contrast , having low levels of traditional gender role perceptions is reported to function as a protective factor in stepfamily mothers' mental health [ 11 ] .
thus , professionals need to consider the stepfamily mother 's place in her family based on a deep understanding of the difficulties surrounding stepfamily formation .
professionals should also help stepmothers and their husbands understand that they need not be unduly bound by the ideals of standard first - marriage nuclear families and suggest alternatives for stepmothers to become something other than " mother " [ 24 ] .
it is also important to provide continuous support to mothers with depression and to link the support to a healthcare agency or other professional agency with counseling services as needed .
study limitations a limitation in this study is the participants' relatively young age due to their being mothers with infants .
also , mean duration of living with a partner was only 4 years as participants were at an earlier stage of stepfamily formation [ 2 ] .
therefore , participants in this study might not be representative of all stepfamilies .
although we obtained a relatively high response rate of 75.1 % , we cannot exclude the possibility that the response rate of stepfamily mothers was lower than that of non - stepfamily mothers .
the most practical means for obtaining more thorough information about stepfamilies is the self - report system at the time of the mother and child health handbook issuance .
also , this study analyzed factors of maternal depression for all mothers .
therefore , the possibility exists that there are other factors associated with maternal depression peculiar to stepfamily mothers .
in this regard , further investigation will be needed .
nevertheless , this study is the first domestic population - based investigation of stepfamilies in japan , with a sample composed of all mothers who brought their 3 - to 4 - month - old infants to a health checkup .
our findings will be useful as a primary source of information to provide better maternal and child health services to stepfamily mothers with infants .
conclusions this study reveals that stepfamilies exhibit many characteristics related to social disadvantage and problems with community - based health care in japan .
healthcare providers should be aware of stepmothers' support needs and should put in place a support system for stepfamilies .
moreover , compared with non - stepfamily mothers , stepfamily mothers have a significantly higher prevalence of depression .
also , the high rate of lack of confidence in parenting can be considered the backdrop to a high prevalence of depression among stepfamily mothers , whereas stepfamily composition does not necessarily increase the risk of maternal depression .
therefore , healthcare providers should put in place a system for obtaining more thorough information about stepfamilies and conduct an early assessment to identify their support needs .

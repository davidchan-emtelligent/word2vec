all the main long chain 5 - n - alkylresorcinols present in rye and wheat , including c23 and c25 analogues and haptens , which have not been previously prepared , were synthesised .
microwave - promoted reactions of a semi - stabilized ylid and alkanals in water gave good yields in both pressurized and open systems .
an alternative microwave - promoted synthesis starting from non - stabilized alkyltriphenylphosphonium salts and 3,5 - dimethoxybenzaldehyde worked as well .
aqueous media were suitable for the reactions even if the starting materials were not soluble in water .
the 5 - n - alkylresorcinols are potential biomarkers of whole grain intake , and the new hapten derivatives of 5 - n - alkylresorcinols will open the way for the immunochemical detection techniques of alkylresorcinols .
5 - n - alkylresorcinols haptens microwave assisted synthesis wittig reaction introduction 5 - alk ( en ) ylresorcinols and related compounds are phenolic lipids present in several families of plants ( e.g. gramineae , anacardiaceae , proteaceae ) and in some families of bacteria [ 1 ] .
we have recently shown that 5 - n - alkylresorcinols ( ar , 1 , see fig. 1 ) act as antioxidants protecting ldl from oxidative damage in in vitro experiments using synthesized pure analogues with varying chain lengths [ 2 ] .
in addition , ar have various biological effects including antimutagenic activity [ 3 - 6 ] , antibacterial properties [ 7 ] , inhibition of enzymes [ 8 - 12 ] and interaction with biological membranes by incorporation to the membrane structure [ 13 - 14 ] .
whole grain rye and wheat products , linked to a healthy diet , are the most important dietary source of ar [ 1 ] .
according to animal and human studies , these compounds are absorbed and at least partially metabolised , and due to their presence in significant amounts in whole grain products they are currently investigated as highly potential biomarkers of whole grain intake [ 15 - 21 ] .
figure 1 5 - n - alkylresorcinols 1 and new hapten derivatives 2 .
however , ar are not generally nor readily available .
thus an efficient preparation method is needed for various analytical , metabolic or bioactivity investigations .
the critical step in the synthesis of long alkyl chain (>= c15 ) ar is the formation of c - c bond between the aromatic ring and the alkyl chain .
the previously reported multistep syntheses utilize techniques that are time - consuming , require an inert atmosphere and give highly variable overall yields .
undoubtedly , the most common approach has been grignard or alkyllithium techniques starting from 3,5 - dimethoxybenzaldehyde ( 18 - 48 % yields whenever reported ) [ 22 - 26 ] .
additional synthetic methods have been developed for shorter chain ar (< c15 ) , such as the aromatization of cyclohexane derivatives in 61 - 66 % yield [ 27 ] .
a recent wittig approach utilises the ozonolysis product of a pentadecylresorcinol ( c15 ) and odd carbon chain ylids , but its use is limited because of the poor availability of odd carbon chain alkyl bromides [ 28 ] .
the synthesis of hapten derivatives of alkylresorcinols 2 , potential compounds in the development of immunochemical analysis techniques , has not been reported previously .
only few papers have reported wittig reactions in water without an organic solvent , although the related horner - wadsworth - emmons reactions , using ester enolate type stabilized phosphonate ylids , have often been conducted in aqueous solutions [ 29 ] .
the existing cases have mostly been targeted for the preparation of stilbenes from benzyltriphenylphosphonium salts and aryl aldehydes [ 30 - 31 ] and also include reactions of stabilized ylids with aryl aldehydes or short alkyl chain alkanals [ 32 - 36 ] and the preparation of o - and p - nitrostyrenes from the highly reactive formaldehyde [ 37 ] .
to provide water solubility more generally , aryl modified phosphonium salts , carrying a - cooh group [ 38 ] or peg attachments [ 39 ] , have been developed but require extensive synthetic work .
previously , non - stabilized alkylphosphonium salts have appeared much less amenable than the benzyl analogues .
a single paper describes the synthesis of two 1 - phenylalkenes in 20 - 30 % yield using benzaldehyde and a ch2cl2 / h2o solvent [ 31 ] .
we report here a fast and efficient synthesis of the long chain 5 - n - alkylresorcinols 1 and the new potential hapten derivatives of 5 - n - alkylresorcinols 2 , ready for the development of antibodies .
we also report that the use of microwave ( mw ) irradiation brings major benefits as regards reaction times and yields in aqueous wittig reactions .
both semi - stabilized and non - stabilized ylids provide an expedient entry to 5 - ( 1 - alkenyl ) resorcinols , readily converted to ar and ar haptens .
results and discussion we approached the wittig synthesis of the precursors of ar and ar haptens from two aspects choosing semi - stabilized and non - stabilized benzylphosphonium or alkylphosphonium ylids ( from salts 3 and 4 ,) as starting materials with 5 or 6 , respectively .
water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent were used as a reaction medium with k2co3 .
mw irradiation was used to speed up reaction rates after the preliminary experiments under conventional heating were found to require very long reaction times .
for the reactions of 3 and 5 , 0.1 m k2co3 was an optimal solvent .
the reactions were performed in 3 or 10 min yielding 66 - 89 % of 7a - d ( scheme 1 , table 1 ) .
the methyl group at c - 2 of 5d hindered the reaction and required the use of an increased amount of 3 to give a yield of 66 % .

b3 equiv of the phosphonium salt was used in the reaction .
the reactions of 4 and 6 required the presence of an organic solvent ( scheme 2 , table 1 ) , as the yield was not satisfactory in the different k2co3 solutions tested ( 0.1 m / 1 m / 5 m / saturated ). of those , the saturated solution gave less than 50 % at best .
a dmso / h2o solution was found to be optimal for these reactions giving the products 8 in 65 - 81 % yield .
in both approaches , mw heating shortened the reaction time to minutes and increased the yield ( e.g. products 7a and 8e ) in comparison with the reactions performed under conventional conditions ( refluxing several hours in e.g. dioxane / h2o / k2co3 ) .

the reactions were performed in either open vessels or sealed pressure vessels .
the yields of the reactions of the alkylphosphonium salts 4 in sealed vessels were not good due to degradation of the ylids under high pressure ( ca. 9 bar ) .
in contrast , reaction of the semi - stabilized benzylic ylid from 3 gave good yield under pressurized conditions , as well as in the open vessel ( product 5 , table 1 ) .
a one - pot procedure was investigated using alkyl bromide , pph3 and 6 in various organic solvents but remained unsuccessful .
mixtures of cis and trans isomers 7a - d and 8 had z / e ratios varying from ca .
40:60 ( 8 ) to ca .
80:20 ( 7a , both in open and sealed vessel ) according to 1h nmr and gc - ms. as the ultimate targets were the c = c reduced ar , the lack of stereochemical control was of no consequence .
following the wittig reaction , catalytic hydrogenation and demethylation gave ar and ar haptens in ca .
40 % overall yield .
the wittig product 7b was a practical starting material for the c23 hapten ( 2d ) , for which commercial alkanal or alkyl bromide precursors are not available ( scheme 1 ) .
5a was readily synthesised by swern - type oxidation ( see supporting information file 1 ) .
the wittig reagents were poorly soluble in water .
nevertheless , functional groups enhancing their solubility , such as previously reported - cooh or peg attachments [ 38 - 39 ] , were not necessary .
both the yields of the preliminary experiments without mw irradiation and the yields of the mw promoted reactions were superior to those reported previously ( 20 - 30 %) for wittig reactions of non - stabilized ylids [ 31 ] .
the monitoring of ar from biological samples , including human plasma [ 15 ] , human and animal ileostomy fluids [ 16 - 17 ] and e.g. perirenal adipose tissue [ 18 ] , has mainly been performed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( gc - ms ) requiring time - consuming sample preparation such as extraction , derivatisation , chromatography , and special equipment .
compared with this , immunochemical techniques would be relatively straightforward being rapid and suitable for screening purposes in large populations .
in the development of immunoanalytical methods , haptens are needed for the preparation of immunogens , which produce specific antisera .
due to the lack of the required haptens , immunoassay has not yet been used in the analysis of ar. for the haptens prepared , four different alkyl chain lengths were chosen to represent ar with a very short , medium length and long alkyl chain , of which c17 and c23 are equivalent to the ar present in whole grains and whole grain products .
the shorter chain length ar are present , for example , in the plant families proteaceae ( chain lengths c9 , c11 ) or anacardiaceae and primulaceae ( c13 ) [ 1 ] .
the non - polar and hydrophobic character of ar increases as the alkyl chain length grows , which may lead to differences in reactivity .
conclusion we have shown that the mw catalyzed reactions of semi - stabilized ylids and alkanals give good yield in pressurized or open systems and without organic solvent , even if they are not soluble in water , being thus practical starting materials for alkylresorcinols and related compounds .
an alternative mw catalyzed synthesis route where 3,5 - dimethoxy benzaldehyde and unstabilized alkyltriphenyl phosphonium ylids react in dmso / h2o works as well and alkylresorcinol precursors that do not have a commercially available alkanal starting material can be synthesized rapidly and efficiently by way of this approach .
the procedure is suitable for all the long chain 5 - n - alkylresorcinols , including the c23:0 and c25:0 analogues , for which synthesis has not been reported previously .
functional groups enhancing the solubility in water are not necessary in the mw promoted wittig reactions of the long alkyl chain reactants .
thus an efficient preparation method of 5 - n - alkylresorcinols and their hapten derivatives was developed .
there was no need for dry solvents or inert atmosphere .

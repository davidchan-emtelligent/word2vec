introduction this paper investigates the existence of multiple positive solutions for the following nonlinear fractional boundary value problem ( bvp , for short ) : ( 1 ) dc0 + alphau ( t )= f ( t,u ( t ) , u '( t )) , 0 < t < 1,u ( 1 )= u '( 1 )= u ''( 0 )= 0 , where 2 < alpha <= 3 is a real number , dc0 + alpha is the caputo fractional derivative , and f : [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , + infinity ) x r - - > [ 0 , + infinity ) is continuous .
recently , fractional differential equations have gained considerable importance due to their wide applications [ 1 - 8 ] in various sciences such as mechanics , chemistry , physics , control theory , and engineering .
much attention has been focused on the solutions of differential equations of fractional order .
some kinds of methods are presented , such as the upper and lower method [ 9 - 11 ] , the laplace transform method [ 12 , 13 ] , the iteration method [ 14 ] , the fourier transform method [ 15 ] , the homotopy analysis method [ 16 , 17 ] , and the green function method [ 18 - 20 ] .
in recent years , there are some papers dealing with the existence and multiplicity of solution to the nonlinear fractional bvp ; for details , see [ 8 , 9 , 11 , 21 ] and references therein .
in [ 21 ] , bai and qiu investigated the following nonlinear fractional bvp : ( 2 ) d0 + alphau ( t )+ f ( t,u ( t ))= 0 , 0 < t < 1,u ( 0 )= u '( 1 )= u ''( 0 )= 0 , where 2 < alpha <= 3 is a real number , d0 + alpha is the caputo fractional derivative , and f : ( 0,1 ] x [ 0 , infinity ) - - >[ 0 , + infinity ) is continuous. by using guo - krasnoselskii 's fixed point theorem and nonlinear alternative of leray - schauder , they established the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the above fractional bvp .
in [ 11 ] , zhao et al. established the existence of multiple positive solutions for the nonlinear fractional bvp : ( 3 ) d0 + alphau ( t )+ f ( t,u ( t ))= 0 , 0 < t < 1 , u ( 0 )= u '( 0 )= u '( 1 )= 0 , where 2 < alpha <= 3 is a real number , d0 + alpha is the riemann - liouville fractional derivative , and f in c ([ 0 , 1 ] , [ 0 , infinity )) .
the authors obtained the existence of positive solutions by the lower and upper solution method and fixed - point theorem .
in [ 8 ] , yang et al. investigated the existence of positive solutions of the bvp for differential equation of fractional order : ( 4 ) d0 + alphau ( t )= f ( t,u ( t ) , u '( t )) , 0 < t < 1,u ( 0 )+ u '( 0 )= 0 , u ( 1 )+ u '( 1 )= 0 , where 1 < alpha <= 2 is a real number , d0 + alpha is the caputo fractional derivative , and f : [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , infinity ) x r - - > [ 0 , infinity ) is continuous. by means of a new fixed point theorem and schauder fixed theorem , some results on the existence of positive solutions are obtained .
though the fractional boundary value problems have been studied by lots of authors , there are few pieces of work considering the case that the nonlinear term f depends on the first order derivative u '( t ) .
in addition , to the best of our knowledge , there is no paper discussing the existence of multiple positive solutions for bvp ( 1 ). by constructing a special cone , using guo - krasnoselskii and leggett - williams fixed point theorems , two sufficient conditions are established for the existence of multiple positive solutions to bvp ( 1 ) .
in addition , by virtue of a new extension of krasnoselskii 's fixed point theorem , a sufficient condition is obtained for the existence of multiple positive solutions of bvp ( 1 ) from its auxiliary problem .
finally , some illustrative examples are worked out to demonstrate the main results .
the organization of this paper is as follows .
section 2 contains some definitions and lemmas of fractional calculus theory which will be used in the next two sections .
in section 3 , we establish the existence results on multiple positive solutions to bvp ( 1 ) by guo - krasnoselskii , leggett - williams fixed point theorem , and another new extension of krasnoselskii 's fixed point theorem .
finally , some examples are presented to support the obtained results in section 4 .
2. preliminary results in this section , we introduce some necessary definitions and preliminary facts which will be used throughout this paper .
definition ( see [ 15 ]) the caputo fractional derivative of order alpha > 0 of a continuous function u : ( 0 , infinity ) - - > r is given by ( 5 ) dc0 + alphau ( t )= 1gamma ( n - alpha ) integral0tu ( n )( s )( t - s ) alpha - n + 1ds , where n = [ alpha ] + 1 , [ alpha ] denotes the integer part of the real number alpha and provided that the right side integral is pointwise defined on [ 0 , infinity ) .
definition ( see [ 15 ]) the riemann - liouville standard fractional derivative of order beta > 0 of a continuous function nu : ( 0 , infinity ) - - > r is given by ( 6 ) d0 + betau ( t )= 1gamma ( n - beta )( ddt ) nintegral0tnu ( s )( t - s ) beta - n + 1ds , where n = [ beta ] + 1 , [ beta ] denotes the integer part of the real number beta , and provided that the right side integral is pointwise defined on [ 0 , infinity ) .
definition ( see [ 15 ]) the riemann - liouville standard fractional integral of order alpha > 0 of a continuous function u : ( 0 , infinity ) - - > r is given by ( 7 ) i0 + alphau ( t )= 1gamma ( alpha ) integral0t ( t - s ) alpha - 1u ( s ) ds , provided that the right side integral is pointwise defined on [ 0 , infinity ) .
lemma 4 ( see [ 15 ]) let n - 1 < alpha <= n ( n in n ) .
then , ( 8 ) i0 + alphadc0 + alphau ( t )= u ( t )+ c0 + c1t + c2t2 +...+ cn - 1tn - 1 , for some c i in r , i = 0,1 ,... , n - 1 , n = [ alpha ] + 1 .
lemma ( see [ 15 ]) let alpha > 0 and y in c [ a , b ] .
then , ( 9 ) ( dca + alphaia + alphay )( x )= y ( x ) holds on [ a , b ] .
lemma 6 ( see [ 15 ]) let alpha > beta > 0 .
if one assumes that u ( t ) in c ( 0,1 ) intersectionl ( 0,1 ) , then d0 + betai0 + alpha u ( t ) = i0 + alpha - beta u ( t ) .
lemma 7 ( see [ 15 ]) let n - 1 < alpha <= n ( n in n ) .
the fractional differential equation d0 + alpha x ( t ) = 0 has solution ( 10 ) x ( t )= c0 + c1t + c2t2 +...+ cn - 1tn - 1 , for some c i in r , i = 0,1 ,... , n - 1 , n = [ alpha ] + 1 .
lemma 8 for any g in c [ 0,1 ] and 2 < alpha <= 3 , the unique solution of problem ( 11 ) dc0 + alphau ( t )= g ( t ) , 0 < t < 1 ; u ( 1 )= u '( 1 )= u ''( 0 )= 0 , is ( 12 ) u ( t )= integral01g ( t,s ) g ( s ) ds , tin [ 0,1 ] , where ( 13 ) g ( t,s )={( t - s ) alpha - 1 - ( 1 - s ) alpha - 1gamma ( alpha ) +( 1 - t )( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) 0 <= s <= t <= 1 ,( 1 - t )( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) - ( 1 - s ) alpha - 1gamma ( alpha ) 0 <= t <= s <= 1 .
here , g ( t , s ) is said to be the green function of bvp ( 11 ) .
proof in view of lemma 4 , ( 11 ) is equivalent to the integral equation ( 14 ) u ( t )= i0 + alphag ( t )+ c0 + c1t + c2t2 , for some c i in r , i = 0,1 , 2 .
so , we have ( 15 ) u '( t )= i0 + alpha - 1g ( t )+ c1 + 2c2t,u ''( t )= i0 + alpha - 2g ( t )+ 2c2. from the boundary condition u ( 1 ) = u '( 1 ) = u ''( 0 ) = 0 , one has ( 16 ) c1 = - i0 + alpha - 1g ( t ) , c2 = 0 , c3 = i0 + alpha - 1g ( t ) - i0 + alphag ( 1 ) .
therefore , by definition 3 , we conclude that the unique solution of bvp ( 11 ) is ( 17 ) u ( t ) = integral0t [( t - s ) alpha - 1 - ( 1 - s ) alpha - 1gamma ( alpha )+( 1 - t )( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 )] g ( s ) ds + integralt1 [( 1 - t )( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) - ( 1 - s ) alpha - 1gamma ( alpha )] g ( s ) ds = integral01g ( t,s ) g ( s ) ds. the proof is completed .
the following properties of the green function play an important role in this paper .
lemma 9 green function g ( t , s ) defined as ( 13 ) satisfies the following conditions .
( i ) g ( t , s ) in c ([ 0,1 ] x [ 0,1 ]) and g ( t , s ) > 0 for any t , s in [ 0,1 ) .
( ii ) there exist a positive number eta and a positive function gamma ( s ) in c [ 0,1 ) such that ( 18 ) min tin [ 0,eta ] g ( t,s )>= etagamma ( s ) , max tin [ 0,1 ] g ( t,s )<= gamma ( s ) , sin [ 0,1 ) .
proof ( i ) it is obvious that g ( t , s ) is continuous on [ 0,1 ] x [ 0,1 ] .
for 0 <= s <= t < 1 , we have ( 19 ) dgdt =( alpha - 1 )( t - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha ) - ( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 )=( t - s ) alpha - 2 - ( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 )< 0 .
similarly , we can obtain that ( 20 ) dgdt = - ( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 )< 0 , 0 <= t <= s < 1 .
hence , dg / dt < 0 for all s , t in [ 0,1 ) .
in addition , it is clear that g ( 1 , s ) = 0 for 0 <= s < 1 .
therefore , we get that g ( t , s ) > 0 for any t , s in [ 0,1 ) .
( ii ) in the following , we consider the existence of eta and gamma ( s ) .
firstly , if 0 <= s <= t < 1 , then by the definition of g ( t , s ) , we have ( 21 ) g ( t,s )>= - ( 1 - s ) alpha - 1gamma ( alpha )+( 1 - t )( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 )>= - ( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha )+( 1 - t )( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 )=( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 )( alpha - 2alpha - 1 - t ) .
if 0 <= t <= s < 1 , then by an argument similar to the case 0 <= s <= t < 1 , we also have g ( t , s ) >= (( 1 - s ) alpha - 2 / gamma ( alpha - 1 ))(( alpha - 2 )/( alpha - 1 ) - t ) .
secondly , for given 0 <= s <= t < 1 , it is obvious that ( 22 ) g ( t,s )<=( 1 - t )( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 )<=( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) .
as 0 <= t <= s < 1 , we also have that ( 23 ) g ( t,s )<=( 1 - t )( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 )<=( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) .
thus , setting ( 24 ) eta = alpha - 22 ( alpha - 1 ) , gamma ( s )=( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) , we immediately obtain that ( 25 ) min tin [ 0,eta ] g ( t,s )>= etagamma ( s ) , max tin [ 0,1 ] g ( t,s )<= gamma ( s ) , sin [ 0,1 ) .
the proof is completed .
now , we list the following fixed point theorems which will be used in the next section .
lemma 10 ( see [ 22 ] , ( guo - krasnoselskii 's fixed point theorem )) let e be a banach space , psubset / equale a cone , and omega 1 , omega 2 two bounded open balls of e centered at the origin with omega 1subsetomega2 .
suppose that a : pintersection ( omega 2 \ omega1 ) - - > p is a completely continuous operator such that either || ax || <= || x || , x in pintersectiondomega 1 and || ax || >= || x || , x in pintersectiondomega 2 , or || ax || >= || x || , x in pintersectiondomega 1 and || ax || <= || x || , x in pintersectiondomega 2 , holds .
then , a has a fixed point in pintersection ( omega 2 \ omega1 ) .
for the sake of stating leggett - williams fixed point theorem , we first give the definition of concave functions .
definition ( see [ 11 ]) the map theta is said to be a nonnegative concave functional on a cone p of a real banach space e provided that theta : p - - > [ 0 , infinity ) is continuous and ( 26 ) theta ( tx +( 1 - t ) y )>= ttheta ( x )+( 1 - t ) theta ( y ) , for all x , y in p and 0 <= t <= 1 .
lemma 12 ( see [ 23 ] , ( leggett - williams fixed point theorem )) let p be a cone in a real banach space e , p c = { x in p : || x || <= c } , theta a nonnegative continuous concave functional on p such that theta ( x ) <= || x || for all xinp c , and p ( theta , b , d ) = { x in p : b in theta ( x ) , || x || <= d } .
suppose that a : p c - - > p c is completely continuous and there exist constants 0 < a < b < d <= c such that ( c1 ) { x in p ( theta , b , d ) : theta ( x ) > b } != empty and theta ( ax ) > b for x in p ( theta , b , d ) ; ( c2 ) || ax || < a for x <= a ; ( c3 ) theta ( ax ) > b for x in p ( theta , b , c ) with || ax || > d. then , a has at least three fixed points x 1 , x 2 , and x 3 with || x 1 || < a , b < theta ( x 2 ) , a < || x 3 || with theta ( x 3 ) < b. remark if d = c holds , then condition ( c 1 ) of lemma 12 implies condition ( c 3 ) .
finally , in this section , we give a new extension of krasnoselskii 's fixed point theorem , which is developed in [ 24 ] .
let x be a banach space and p subset x a cone .
suppose that alpha , beta : x - - > r + are two continuous convex functions satisfying ( 27 ) alpha ( lambdau )=| lambda | alpha ( u ) , beta ( lambdau )=| lambda | beta ( u ) for u in x , lambda in r ; || u || <= rhomax { alpha ( u ) , beta ( u )} for u in x ; and alpha ( u 1 ) <= alpha ( u 2 ) for u 1 , u 2 in p , u 1 <= u 2 , where rho > 0 is a constant .
lemma 14 ( see [ 24 ]) let r 2 > r 1 > 0 , l > 0 be constants and omega i = { u in x : alpha ( u ) < r i , beta ( u ) < l } , ( i = 1,2 ) two bounded open sets in x. set d i = { u in x : alpha ( u ) = r i } .
assume that t : p - - > p is a completely continuous operator satisfying ( d1 ) alpha ( tu ) < r 1 , u in d 1intersectionp ; alpha ( tu ) > r 2 , u in d 2intersectionp ; ( d2 ) beta ( tu ) < l , u in p ; ( d3 ) there is a p in ( omega 2intersectionp )\{ 0 } such that alpha ( p ) != 0 and alpha ( u + lambdap ) >= alpha ( u ) for all u in p and lambda >= 0 .
then , t has at least one fixed point in ( omega2 \ omega 1 ) intersectionp .
3. main results in this section , we assume that f : [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , + infinity ) x r - - > [ 0 , + infinity ) is continuous and satisfies some specific growth conditions , which allows us to apply lemmas 10 - 14 to establish the existence of multiple positive solutions for bvp ( 1 ) .
first , let x = c 1 [ 0,1 ] be endowed with the norm ( 28 ) || u ||= max tin [ 0,1 ]| u ( t )|+ max tin [ 0,1 ]| u '( t )|=|| u || 0 +|| u '|| 0 .
define the set p subset x by ( 29 ) p ={ uinx : u ( t )>= 0 ; u ( 1 )= 0 ; u ( t )>= eta || u || 0,tin [ 0,eta ]} .
it is easy to verify that p is a cone in the space x. let the nonnegative continuous concave function theta on the cone p be defined by ( 30 ) theta ( u )= min tin [ 0,eta ]| u ( t )| .
define an operator t on p by the formula ( 31 ) ( tu )( t )= integral01g ( t,s ) f ( s,u ( s ) , u '( s )) ds. lemma 15 the operator t : p - - > p is completely continuous .
proof for any u in p , we have that tu ( t ) >= 0 in view of nonnegativeness of g ( t , s ) and f ( s , u , u ') .
it is obvious that ( 32 ) ( tu )( 1 )= integral01g ( 1,s ) f ( s,u ( s ) , u '( s )) ds = 0. by lemma 9 , for any t in [ 0 , eta ] and tau in [ 0,1 ] , we obtain that ( 33 ) ( tu )( t )>= etaintegral01gamma ( s ) f ( s,u,u ') ds >= etaintegral01g ( tau,s ) f ( s,u,u ') ds = eta ( tu )( tau )>= eta || tu || 0 .
hence , t ( p ) subset p. the operator t : p - - > p is continuous in view of continuity of g ( t , s ) and f ( s , u , u ') .
let u subset p be bounded ; that is , there exists a positive constant k > 0 such that || u || <= k for all u in u. by means of the definition of || u || , we have | u ( t )| <= k and | u '( t )| <= k for t in [ 0 , 1 ] .
let c = max tin [ 0,1 ] , uinu | f ( t , u ( t ) , u '( t ))| + 1 .
then , for u in u , by lemma 9 , we have ( 34 ) |( tu )( t )|<= integral01g ( t,s ) f ( s,u ( s ) , u '( s )) ds <= cintegral01gamma ( s ) ds <= 2cgamma ( alpha ),|( tu ')( t )|<= c [ 1gamma ( alpha - 1 ) integral0t ( t - s ) alpha - 2ds + 1gamma ( alpha - 1 ) integral01 ( 1 - s ) alpha - 2ds ]<= 2cgamma ( alpha ) .
hence , t ( u ) is bounded .
for each u in u , t 1 , t 2 in [ 0,1 ] with t 1 < t 2 , then ( 35 ) |( tu )( t2 ) - ( tu )( t1 )| <= integral0t1 |[ g ( t2,s ) - g ( t1,s )] f ( s,u,u ')| ds + integralt21 |[ g ( t2,s ) - g ( t1,s )] f ( s,u,u ')| ds + integralt1t2 |[ g ( t2,s ) - g ( t1,s )] f ( s,u,u ')| ds <= c { integral0t1 [( t2 - s ) alpha - 1 - ( t1 - s ) alpha - 1gamma ( alpha ) +( 1 - s ) alpha - 2 ( t2 - t1 ) gamma ( alpha - 1 )] ds + integralt21 ( 1 - s ) alpha - 2 ( t2 - t1 ) gamma ( alpha - 1 ) ds + integralt1t2 [( t2 - s ) alpha - 1gamma ( alpha )+( 1 - s ) alpha - 2 ( t2 - t1 ) gamma ( alpha - 1 )] ds } <= c [ t2 - t1gamma ( alpha - 1 )+ alpha - 1gamma ( alpha )( t2 - t1 )+( t2 - t1 ) alphagamma ( alpha )] = c [ 2 ( t2 - t1 ) gamma ( alpha - 1 )+( t2 - t1 ) alphagamma ( alpha )],|( tu )'( t2 ) - ( tu )'( t1 )| =| integral0t2 ( t2 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) f ( s,u,u ') ds - integral0t1 ( t1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) f ( s,u,u ') ds | <= c | integral0t1 ( t2 - s ) alpha - 2 - ( t1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) ds + integralt1t2 ( t2 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) ds | <= c [ t2alpha - 1 - t1alpha - 1gamma ( alpha )+( t2 - t1 ) alpha - 1gamma ( alpha )+( t2 - t1 ) alpha - 1gamma ( alpha )] <= cgamma ( alpha )[ 2 ( t2 - t1 ) alpha - 1 +( t2alpha - 1 - t1alpha - 1 )]. by means of the arzela - ascoli theorem , one can obtain that the operator t is completely continuous .
the proof is completed .
now , we are in a position to state the main results .
for convenience , denote ( 36 ) m =( integral013gamma ( s ) ds ) - 1 , n =( integral0etaetagamma ( s ) ds ) - 1 .
theorem 16 assume that there exist two positive constants sigma 2 > sigma 1 > 0 such that ( h1 ) f ( t , u , v ) <= msigma 2 for ( t , u , v ) in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , sigma 2 ] x [ - sigma 2 , sigma 2 ] ; ( h2 ) f ( t , u , v ) >= nsigma 1 for ( t , u , v ) in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , sigma 1 ] x [ - sigma 1 , sigma 1 ] .
then , bvp ( 1 ) has at least one solution u such that sigma 1 <= || u || <= sigma 2 .
proof by lemma 15 , we know that the operator t : p - - > p defined by ( 31 ) is completely continuous .
( i ) let omega 2 = { u in p : || u || < sigma 2 } .
for any u in pintersectiondomega 2 , we have 0 <= u ( t ) <= sigma 2 , - sigma 2 <= u '( t ) <= sigma 2 for all t in [ 0,1 ] .
it follows from condition ( h 1 ) and lemma 9 that , for t in [ 0,1 ] , ( 37 ) || tu ||= max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01g ( t,s ) f ( s,u,u ') ds | + max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01dg ( t,s ) dtf ( s,u,u ') ds |<= msigma2 [ integral01gamma ( s ) ds + integral012gamma ( s ) ds ]= msigma2integral013gamma ( s ) ds = sigma2 =|| u || , which implies that || tu || <= || u || , u in pintersectiondomega 2 .
( ii ) let omega 1 = { u in p : || u || < sigma 1 } .
for any u in pintersectiondomega 1 , we have 0 <= u ( t ) <= sigma 1 , - sigma 1 <= u '( t ) <= sigma 1 for all t in [ 0,1 ] .
it follows from condition ( h 2 ) and lemma 9 that , for t in [ 0,1 ] , ( 38 ) || tu ||= max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01g ( t,s ) f ( s,u,u ') ds | + max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01dg ( t,s ) dtf ( s,u,u ') ds |>= max tin [ 0,eta ]| integral01g ( t,s ) f ( s,u,u ') ds |>= nsigma1 [ etaintegral0etagamma ( s ) ds ]= sigma1 =|| u || , which implies that || tu || >= || u || , u in pintersectiondomega 1 .
in view of lemma 10 , t has a fixed point in pintersection ( omega 2 \ omega1 ) which is a solution of bvp ( 1 ) .
the proof is completed .
theorem 17 suppose that there exist constants 0 < a < b < c such that the following assumptions hold : ( a1 ) f ( t , u , v ) < ma for ( t , u , v ) in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , a ] x [ - a , a ] ; ( a2 ) f ( t , u , v ) >= nb for ( t , u , v ) in [ 0 , eta ] x [ b , c ] x [ - c , c ] ; ( a3 ) f ( t , u , v ) <= mc for ( t , u , v ) in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , c ] x [ - c , c ] .
then , bvp ( 1 ) has at least three positive solutions u 1 , u 2 , and u 3 with ( 39 ) max tin [ 0,1 ]| u1 ( t )|< a , b < min tin [ 0,eta ]| u2 ( t )|< max tin [ 0,1 ]| u2 ( t )|<= c,a < max tin [ 0,1 ]| u3 ( t )|<= c , min tin [ 0,eta ]| u3 ( t )|< b. proof we will show that all the conditions of lemma 12 are satisfied .
first , if uinp c , then || u || <= c. by condition ( a 3 ) and lemma 9 , we have ( 40 ) || tu ||= max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01g ( t,s ) f ( s,u,u ') ds | + max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01dg ( t,s ) dtf ( s,u,u ') ds |<= mc [ integral01gamma ( s ) ds + integral012gamma ( s ) ds ]= mcintegral013gamma ( s ) ds = c , which implies that || tu || <= c for uinp c. hence , t : p c - - > p c. next , by using the analogous argument , it follows from condition ( a 1 ) that || tu || < a for uinp a. choose u ( t ) = ( b + c )/ 2 for t in [ 0,1 ] .
it is easy to see that ( 41 ) u ( t )= b + c2inp ( theta,b,c ) , theta ( u )= theta ( b + c2 )> b ; consequently , { u in p ( theta , b , c ) | theta ( u ) > b } != empty .
hence , if u in p ( theta , b , c ) , then b <= u ( t ) <= c for t in [ 0 , eta ]. by condition ( a 2 ) , we have f ( t , u ( t ) , u '( t )) >= nb for t in [ 0 , eta ] .
so , ( 42 ) theta ( tu )= min tin [ 0,eta ]|( tu )( t )|= min tin [ 0,eta ]| integral01g ( t,s ) f ( s,u ( s ) , u '( s )) ds |>= integral01etagamma ( s ) f ( s,u ( s ) , u '( s )) ds >= nintegral0etaetagamma ( s ) ds.b = b , which implies that theta ( tu ) > b for u in p ( theta , b , c ). by lemma 12 , bvp ( 1 ) has at least three positive solutions u 1 , u 2 , and u 3 with ( 43 ) max tin [ 0,1 ]| u1 ( t )|< a , b < min tin [ 0,eta ]| u2 ( t )|< max tin [ 0,1 ]| u2 ( t )|<= c,a < max tin [ 0,1 ]| u3 ( t )|<= c , min tin [ 0,eta ]| u3 ( t )|< b. the proof is completed .
theorem 18 assume that there exist constants l > d > etad > q > 0 such that ( b1 ) f ( t , u , v ) < q / m ' for ( t , u , v ) in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , q ] x [ - l , l ] ; ( b2 ) f ( t , u , v ) >= d / n ' for ( t , u , v ) in [ 0 , eta ] x [ etad , d ] x [ - l , l ] ; ( b3 ) f ( t , u , v ) < l / q for ( t , u , v ) in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , d ] x [ - l , l ] , where ( 44 ) m '= integral01gamma ( s ) ds , n '= integral0etaetagamma ( s ) ds , q = 2gamma ( alpha ) .
then , bvp ( 1 ) has at least one positive solution u ( t ) satisfying q < alpha ( u ) < d , | u '( t )| < l for t in [ 0,1 ] .
proof in order to apply the new extension of krasnoselskii 's fixed point theorem , we consider the following auxiliary bvp : ( 45 ) d0 + alphacu ( t )= f *( t,u ( t ) , u '( t )) , 0 < t < 1,u ( 1 )= u '( 1 )= u ''( 0 )= 0 , where ( 46 ) f *( t,u,v )={ f ( t,u,v ) ( t,u,v ) in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0,d ] x [ - l,l ] , f ( t,d,v ) ( t,u,v ) in [ 0,1 ] x ( d ,+ infinity ) x [ - l,l ] , f ( t,u , - l ) ( t,u,v ) in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0,d ] x ( - infinity , - l ] , f ( t,d , - l ) ( t,u,v ) in [ 0,1 ] x ( d ,+ infinity ) x ( - infinity , - l ] , f ( t,u,l ) ( t,u,v ) in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0,d ] x [ l ,+ infinity ] , f ( t,d,l ) ( t,u,v ) in [ 0,1 ] x ( d ,+ infinity ) x [ l ,+ infinity ) .
it is obvious that f * : [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , + infinity ) x r - - > [ 0 , + infinity ) is continuous according to the continuity of f. by using the similar proof of lemma 15 , one can obtain that the operator t * given by ( 47 ) ( t * u )( t )= integral01g ( t,s ) f *( s,u ( s ) , u '( s )) ds is also completely continuous on p and maps p into p. let ( 48 ) lambda1 ={ uinx :| u ( t )|< q ,| u '( t )|< l } , lambda2 ={ uinx :| u ( t )|< d ,| u '( t )|< l } , d1 ={ uinx : alpha ( u )= q } , d2 ={ uinx : alpha ( u )= d } .
it is obvious that there exists a nonnegative function p in ( lambda2intersectionp )\{ 0 } such that alpha ( u + lambdap ) >= alpha ( u ) for all u in p , lambda >= 0 .
we divide the proof into the following three steps .
step 1. by virtue of condition ( b 1 ) and alpha ( u ) = q , u in d 1intersectionp , we have ( 49 ) alpha ( t * u )= max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01g ( t,s ) f *( s,u ( s ) , u '( s )) ds |< max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01g ( t,s ) qm'ds |<= qm'integral01gamma ( s ) ds = q. step 2 .
for alpha ( u ) = d , u in d 2intersectionp , it follows from u ( t ) >= eta || u || 0 , t in [ 0 , eta ] , and condition ( b 2 ) that ( 50 ) alpha ( t * u )= max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01g ( t,s ) f *( s,u ( s ) , u '( s )) ds |> max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral0etag ( t,s ) dn'ds |>= dn'integral0etaetagamma ( s ) ds = d. step 3 .
in view of condition ( b 3 ) , for u in pintersectionlambda2 , we have ( 51 ) beta ( t * u ) = max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral01dg ( t,s ) dtf *( s,u ( s ) , u '( s )) ds | = max tin [ 0,1 ]| integral0t ( t - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) f *( s,u,u ') ds - integral01 ( 1 - s ) alpha - 2gamma ( alpha - 1 ) f *( s,u,u ') ds | < lq [ 1gamma ( alpha - 1 ) integral01 ( t - s ) alpha - 2ds + 1gamma ( alpha - 1 ) integral01 ( 1 - s ) alpha - 2ds ] <= lq2gamma ( alpha )= l. hence , beta ( t * u ) < l. by lemma 14 , there exists uin ( lambda2 \ lambda 1 ) intersectionp such that u ( t ) = ( t * u )( t ) .
consequently , u ( t ) is a positive solution for the auxiliary bvp ( 45 ) satisfying q < alpha ( u ) < d , | u '( t )| < l. in addition , by virtue of the definition of f * , we know that f *( t , u ( t ) , u '( t )) = f ( t , u ( t ) , u '( t )) , t in [ 0,1 ] .
therefore , u is a positive solution of bvp ( 1 ) .
the proof is completed .
4. examples example 1 consider the following fractional bvp : ( 52 ) d0 + 5 / 2cu ( t )= u2 +( u ') 22 + et100 , 0 < t < 1,u ( 1 )= u '( 1 )= u ''( 0 )= 0. by a simple calculation , one can obtain that eta = 1 / 6 , m = pi / 4 =~ 0.443 , and n =~ 33.333 .
choosing sigma 1 = 1 / 104 , sigma 2 = 1 / 10 , we have ( 53 ) f ( t,u,u ')= u2 +( u ') 22 + et100 <= 0.037 <= msigma2 =~ 0.0443 for ( t , u , u ') in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , 1 / 10 ] x [ - ( 1 / 10 ) , 1 / 10 ] and ( 54 ) f ( t,u,u ')= u2 +( u ') 22 + et100 >= 0.01 >= nsigma1 =~ 0.00333 for ( t , u , u ') in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , 1 / 104 ] x [ - ( 1 / 104 ) , 1 / 104 ]. with the use of theorem 16 , bvp ( 52 ) has at least one solution u such that 1 / 104 <= || u || <= 1 / 10 .
example 2 consider the following fractional bvp : ( 55 ) d0 + 5 / 2cu ( t )= f ( t,u ( t ) , u '( t )) , 0 < t < 1,u ( 1 )= u '( 1 )= u ''( 0 )= 0 , where ( 56 ) f ( t,u,v )={ sin ( pit ) 103 + u4 +| v | 100,0 <= u <= 1,1 + sin ( pit ) 103 + u20 +| v | 100,u > 1 .
choosing a = 1 / 10 , b = 1 / 50 , and c = 4 , then , there hold ( 57 ) f ( t,u,u ')= sin ( pit ) 103 + u4 +| v | 100 <= 0.0021 < ma =~ 0.00443 for ( t , u , u ') in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , 1 / 100 ] x [ - ( 1 / 100 ) , 1 / 100 ] ( 58 ) f ( t,u,u ')= 1 + sin ( pit ) 103 + u20 +| v | 100 >= 35 >= nb =~ 33.333 for ( t , u , u ') in [ 0 , 1 / 6 ] x [ 1,4 ] x [ - 4,4 ] ; and ( 59 ) f ( t,u,u ')= 1 + sin ( pit ) 103 + u20 +| v | 100 <= 1.221 <= mc =~ 1.772 for ( t , u , u ') in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0,4 ] x [ - 4,4 ] .
hence , all the conditions of theorem 17 are satisfied. by theorem 17 , bvp ( 55 ) has at least three positive solutions u 1 , u 2 , and u 3 such that ( 60 ) max tin [ 0,1 ]| u1 ( t )|< 1100,150 < min tin [ 0,1 / 6 ]| u2 ( t )|< max tin [ 0,1 ]| u2 ( t )|<= 4,1100 < max tin [ 0,1 ]| u3 ( t )|<= 4 , min tin [ 0,1 / 6 ]| u3 ( t )|< 150 .
example 3 consider the following fractional bvp : ( 61 ) d0 + 5 / 2cu ( t )= f ( t,u ( t ) , u '( t )) , 0 < t < 1,u ( 1 )= u '( 1 )= u ''( 0 )= 0 , where ( 62 ) f ( t,u,v )= t40 + 6u3 +| u '| 1 / 6310 .
after a simple computation , one can find that ( 63 ) m '= 43pi =~ 0.752445 , n '=~ 0.03,q = 83pi =~ 1.50489 .
choosing d = 36 , q = 1 / 3 , and l = 59 = 1953125 , we know that ( 64 ) f ( t,u,u ')<= 0.248 < qm '=~ 0.443 for ( t , u , u ') in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0 , 1 / 3 ] x [ - 59 , 59 ] ; ( 65 ) f ( t,u,u ')>= 1296 >= dn '=~ 1200 for ( t , u , u ') in [ 0 , 1 / 6 ] x [ 6,36 ] x [ - 59 , 59 ] ; and ( 66 ) f ( t,u,u ')<= 279936.03 < lq =~ 1302083.3 for ( t , u , u ') in [ 0,1 ] x [ 0,36 ] x [ - 59 , 59 ] .
so , all the conditions of theorem 18 are satisfied. by theorem 18 , bvp ( 61 ) has at least one positive solution u ( t ) satisfying 1 / 3 < max tin [ 0,1 ] | u ( t )| < 36 , | u '( t )| < 59 .

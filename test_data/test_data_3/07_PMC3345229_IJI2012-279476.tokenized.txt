pancreatic pseudocyst develops in both acute and chronic pancreatitis .
it is an entity likely to either remain asymptomatic or develop devastating complications .
despite being diagnosed easily , treatment exercise is still at crossroads whether in the form of internal or external drainage or endoscopic , laparoscopic , or open intervention with a good radiological guidance .
the therapeutic dilemma whether to treat a patient with a pancreatic pseudocyst , as well as when and with what technique , is a difficult one .
this paper is intended to get information about diagnostic and therapeutic exercises most appropriate for acute and chronic pancreatic pseudocyst .
1. background the first description of pseudopancreatic cyst dates back almost two and half centuries to 1761 a.d. by cannon et al .
[ 1 ] .
the management of cystic changes of the pancreas is an old problem .
eugene opie , at the beginning of twentieth century , was the first to distinguish true pancreatic cysts , which are , by definition , lined by epithelium , from pseudocysts , which are surrounded by a wall composed of collagen and granulation tissue .
more than two centuries after the first description , some clear consensus and guidelines were evolved in the atlanta classification of 1993 [ 2 ] .
the atlanta classification consists of four distinct disease entities : acute fluid collections that develop early in the course of acute pancreatitis and do not yet have a cyst wall ; acute pancreatic pseudocysts , which arise as sequelae of acute pancreatitis or trauma , and whose wall consists of granulation tissue and extracellular matrix ; chronic pancreatic pseudocysts , which arise as sequelae of chronic pancreatitis and are likewise surrounded by a wall ; pancreatic abscesses , which are intra - abdominal collections of pus immediately adjacent to the pancreas , without any large areas of necrosis .
acute fluid collections , pancreatic pseudocysts , and pancreatic abscesses can be distinguished from one another by the history , imaging studies of the wall of the abnormality and its contents , and , if necessary , a needle aspiration of the content [ 2 ] .
2. introduction pseudocysts are formed after acute as well as chronic pancreatitis but more common after acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis than acute pancreatitis .
there is lack of data containing randomized case - control studies , but numerous case series and reports indicate that pancreatic injury leads to pseudocyst formation .
pancreatic pseudocysts often arise as a complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis .
the prevalence of pancreatic pseudocysts in acute pancreatitis has been reported to range from 6 % to 18.5 % [ 3 , 4 ] .
the prevalence of pancreatic pseudocysts in chronic pancreatitis range 20 % to 40 % [ 5 ] .
pancreatic pseudocysts most commonly arise in patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis ( from 70 % to 78 %) [ 6 ] .
the second most common cause is idiopathic chronic pancreatitis ( from 6 % to 16 %) , followed by biliary pancreatitis ( from 6 % to 8 %) .
the incidence of pseudocyst is low ranging from 1.6 to 4.5 % or 0.5 to 1 per 100000 adults per year [ 7 , 8 ] .
3. classification d'egidio and schein , in 1991 , described a classification of pancreatic pseudocyst based on the underlying etiology of pancreatitis ( acute or chronic ) , the pancreatic ductal anatomy , and the presence of communication between the cyst and the pancreatic duct and defined three distinct types of pseudocysts [ 9 ] .
typei , or acute " postnecrotic " pseudocysts that occur after an episode of acute pancreatitis and are associated with normal duct anatomy , rarely communicates with the pancreatic duct .
type ii , also postnecrotic pseudocysts , which occurs after an episode of acute - on - chronic pancreatitis ( the pancreatic duct is diseased but not strictured , and there is often a duct - pseudocyst communication ) .
type iii , defined as " retention " pseudocysts , occurs with chronic pancreatitis and is uniformly associated with duct stricture and pseudocyst duct communication .
another classification , based entirely on pancreatic duct anatomy , is proposed by nealon and walser [ 10 ] .
type i : normal duct / no communication with the cyst .
type ii : normal duct with duct - cyst communication .
type iii : otherwise normal duct with stricture and no duct - cyst communication .
type iv : otherwise normal duct with stricture and duct - cyst communication .
type v : otherwise normal duct with complete cutoff .
type vi : chronic pancreatitis and no duct - cyst communication .
type vii : chronic pancreatitis with duct - cyst communication [ 10 ] .
4. diagnosis pseudocyst of pancreas must be preceded by attacks of pancreatitis in either acute or chronic form .
most of the times , clinical , biochemical , and radiological evidence of pancreatitis present , but still a large number of patients may present with features of pancreatic pseudocyst without any documentary evidence of pancreatitis .
one should always consider the possibility of a pseudocyst in a patient who has persistent abdominal pain , anorexia , or abdominal mass after a case of pancreatitis .
rarely , patients present with jaundice or sepsis from an infected pseudocyst [ 11 ] .
in patients presenting with pancreatic cyst incidentally discovered on imaging , a crucial point is to define whether the patient has had prior history of pancreatitis [ 12 ] .
rarely , patients with large pancreatic pseudocyst may be asymptomatic occasionally .
tender abdomen with palpable mass is the positive finding on physical examination .
fever , icterus , and pleural effusion may be present in complicated pseudocyst .
if pseudocyst ruptures then features of secondary peritonitis set in and presentation may be like septicaemic shock [ 11 ] .
the diagnosis of a pancreatic pseudocyst is usually established by imaging studies , among which transabdominal ultrasonography is important as an initial investigation [ 13 ] .
computerized tomography ( ct ) is often the imaging method of choice , with 82 % to 100 % sensitivity and 98 % specificity [ 14 ] .
biochemical parameters have limited role in diagnosis .
among remarkable parameters are serum amylase and serum lipase , which will be elevated in most cases .
liver functions are normally unchanged but may be deranged in cases where obstruction to the biliary tract occurs .
another thing to be considered is strong possibility of biliary peritonitis if liver parameters deranged .
other inflammatory marker c - reactive protein is raised and is of prognostic significance only .
elevated triglycerides and low serum calcium are indirect indictors of panreatic pseudocyst .
differential diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst always may be of two possibilities either intrapancreatic lesions or extrapancreatic lesions .
intrapancreatic diseases mimicking pancreatitis are : pancreatitis ( acute and chronic ) , pancreatic necrosis , pancreatic abscess , adenocarcinoma of pancreas , cystic neoplasm of pancreas , pancreatic artery pseudoaneurysm .
extrapancreatic diseases mimicking pancreatitis are peptic ulcer disease , acute cholecystitis and cholelithiasis , gastric cancer , abdominal aortic aneurysm , ovarian cysts and carcinoma , acute myocardial infarction , pneumonia , intestinal obstruction , intestinal ischemia .
among different imaging modalities , ultrasound ( usg ) is the foremost diagnostic tool and also useful pointer of diagnosis in most of the cases .
it may be used in transabdominal usg , colour doppler study , duplex scanning , endoscopic usg .
pancreatic pseudocyst appears as anechoic structure usually round or oval and surrounded by a smooth wall associated with distal acoustic enhancement on us examination .
they are well defined and round or oval , and they are contained within a smooth wall .
during the early phases of their development , pseudocysts can appear more complex , with varying degrees of internal echoes .
if the earliest detection missed sometimes it may be due to excessive bowel gas .
when necrotic debris or hemorrhage presents inside cyst or infection sets in then the interpretation on usg may be difficult .
color doppler or duplex scanning should always be performed in cystic lesions to ensure that the lesion in question is not a giant pseudoaneurysm .
sensitivity rates for us in the detection of pancreatic pseudocysts are from 75 % to 90 % .
therefore , us is inferior to ct , which has a sensitivity rate of 90 % - 100 % .
us has several limitations , as compared with ct , in the initial diagnosis of a pseudocyst : the presence of overlying bowel gas decreases the sensitivity of us , and unlike ct , us examinations are highly operator dependent [ 15 ] .
a thick - walled , rounded , and fluid - filled mass adjacent to the pancreas on an abdominal ct scan in a patient with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis is virtually pathognomonic for pancreatic pseudocyst .
in acute manifestations when ileus or excessive gas shadow or bowel obstruction is a problem in usg evaluation , ct scan is definitely better and is purposeful in diagnosing pseudocyst .
it is almost diagnostic and no other supplementary investigation that is required to confirm the diagnosis .
major advantage of ct scan is the detection of an objective and detailed anatomy as well as pathology .
in addition to pancreas , extrapancreatic pathology as well as status of adjoining organs , for example , gallbladder , liver , common bile duct , stomach , and duodenum can be perfectly assessed .
contrast - enhanced ct is now the primary tool of investigation for initial diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocysts .
usg should be done for the followup of asymptomatic pseudocysts or when diagnosis is uncertain .
the only major limitation of ct scan is that it is unable to differentiate cystic neoplasm of pancreas from pseudocyst , and the main pathology to be missed is mucinous cystadenomas and intraductal papillary mucinous cystadenoma ( ipmn ) [ 16 ] .
mri and mrcp are accurate and sensitive diagnostic aids for defining the anatomy of duct better than any other diagnostic tool .
but these are not used routinely as adequate information is obtained in maximum cases by ct , and very rarely ductal anatomy is needed to be calibrated with too much precision and mri / mrcp is required .
pancreatic duct and biliary system are best visualized in detail although interpretation of integrity of pancreatic duct may be difficult [ 17 ] .
mrcp techniques can also depict subtle branch - chain dilatation in chronic pancreatitis .
mri is also highly sensitive to the detection of bleeding with complex fluid collections .
the role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) is limited to some extent for therapeutic intervention rather than diagnostic purpose .
it may help in planning an intervention after the increased use of endoscopic usg its role is gradually decreasing .
endoscopic ultrasound ( eus ) is a test of choice to differentiate between cystic neoplasms of pancreas from pseudocyst .
eus is usually used as a secondary test to further evaluate pancreatic cyst detected by other imaging modality ( us , ct or mri ) .
for the distinction of acute fluid collections from pancreatic abscesses and acute pancreatic pseudocysts , endosonography ( eus ) has the highest sensitivity ( 93 % to 100 %) and specificity ( 92 % to 98 %) .
the diagnostic puncture of a pseudocyst under eus guidance helps distinguish cystic malignancies from pseudocysts .
a malignant lesion is more likely present when the carcinoembryogenic antigen ( cea ) value exceeds 192 ng / ml and when the cyst contents are highly viscous [ 18 ] .
visualization of the pancreas via eus provides high quality images due to the close proximity analysis , which are helpful to detect malignancy .
an elevated cea level on fnac within the cyst fluid strongly suggests mucinous lesion [ 19 , 20 ] .
amylase levels are usually high in pseudocysts and low in serous cystadenoma of the ultrasound transducer to the area of interest .
criteria suggestive of cystic neoplasm include a cyst wall thickness of greater than 3 mm , macroseptation ( all cystic components more than 10 mm ) , the presence of a mass or nodule , and cystic dilation of the main pancreatic duct [ 19 - 21 ] .
aspiration of cyst fluid under eus guidance and biochemical analysis with molecular analysis helps in differentiating different cystic neoplasms of pancreas .
mutational changes and dna content point towards malignancy .
5. treatment treatment of pseudopancreatic cyst comprises two aspects : supportive care or medical management and definitive care or surgical drainage .
intravenous fluids , analgesics , and antiemetics are the basic requirements .
low - far diet is given to patients who tolerate and intake .
in patients with low or poor oral intake , support can be provided via nasoenteral feeding or total parenteral nutrition ( tpn ) .
to date , no studies have compared these two approaches in the seating of pancreatic pseudocyst , and the choice is based on availability and local preferences .
if one can extrapolate from studies comparing the two modalities in the seating of acute necrotizing pancreatitis , one can expect that jejunal feeding will be related with fewer complications ( infection ) but may not be able to provide as much calories as tpn .
the role of octreotide is still dubious as this has not been tested much with strong evidence in the literature .
the rationale of using octreotide as a therapy for pancreatic pseudocyst is that it will decrease pancreatic secretions and aid in pseudocyst resolution .
unfortunately , this strategy has not been rigorously tested and only a handful of case series have been published [ 22 , 23 ] .
most pseudocysts resolve with supportive medical care .
vitas and sarr followed over a period of 5 years 114 patients with the diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst [ 24 ] .
forty - six patients underwent primary operative therapy , with 13 % undergoing emergency operations for pseudocyst - related complications .
morbidity occurred in 26 % of patients ( emergency operations , 67 % ; elective procedures , 10 %) without any mortality .
the remaining 68 patients were initially treated with a nonoperative expectant approach .
severe and life - threatening complications in this group ( followup for a mean of 46 month ) occurred in only six patients ( 9 %) ; 19 patients eventually underwent elective operations directed at either the pseudocyst or other complications related to pancreatitis .
overall , in patients managed by a nonoperative approach , resolution of the pseudocyst occurred in 57 % of the 24 patients with satisfactory radiographic followup , with 38 % resolving more than 6 months after diagnosis .
although patients eventually undergoing operation tended to have larger pancreatic pseudocysts than the patients managed successfully nonoperatively ( 6.9 cm versus 4.9 cm ) , no serious complications occurred in seven patients with pancreatic pseudocysts greater than 10 cm who were treated expectantly [ 24 ] .
large - sized and long - standing cysts are not likely to respond on conservative treatment and more likely to have complications during the course of the disease .
morbidity and mortality are more commonly found in this group .
these patients need surgical intervention and usually managed surgically .
but some studies say that size and duration never matter , and actually these patients too have excellent surgical results and do well .
there are two definite conclusions that the presence and the severity of symptoms and complications are determinants of prognosis and course in pancreatitis [ 25 - 27 ] .
6. drainage procedures most of the symptomatic and complicated pancreatic pseudocysts need intervention in any form during the course of the disease .
intervention options are either guided endoscopically , radiologically , laparoscopically , or open / direct .
to date , no prospective controlled studies have compared directly percutaneous , surgical , and endoscopic drainage approaches .
as a result , the management varies based on local expertise , but in general endoscopic drainage is becoming the preferred approach followed by laparoscopic approach .
there is no consensus regarding methods of intervention in pancreatic pseudocyst although there is no controversy with conservative treatment .
minimal intervention with maximal conservative approach remains the most widely acceptable option of therapeutic intervention in pancreatic pseudocyst .
small sized asymptomatic cysts need no intervention at all .
asymptomatic large - sized cyst should be intervened after six weeks only and in the meantime is must be under close monitoring to detect the earliest symptoms or complications .
only in symptomatic cases or if any complication develops , intervention is required before six weeks .
cyst of any size should be intervened once it becomes symptomatic or if complications develop irrespective of duration , size , or site .
so two things are important determinants the regarding plan of management : size when it is more than five cm and duration when it is more that six weeks .
6.1 .
external drainage external drainage can be achieved radiologically by using ct or us guidance .
in this technique , a drainage pigtail catheter is placed percutaneously into the fluid cavity , and the fluid is drained .
three - dimensional ultrasonography has been reported useful for the guidance of catheters into cyst cavities and avoiding vessels .
when the drainage output becomes minimal , the catheter is removed .
contrast injection into the cyst cavity will demonstrate the size of the remaining cavity , and this finding can be used to monitor the progress .
this technique is successful in resolving pseudocysts , but it has a high risk of infections .
this technique is definitely a failure if the catheter tends to block repeatedly .
it tends to create significant discomfort to the patient .
furthermore , the catheter tends to clog and may require repositioning and exchange .
the reported long - term success rate of pseudocyst resolution for us - guided pseudocyst drainage is around 50 % .
unsuccessful drainages are usually caused by large ductal leaks or obstruction of the main pancreatic duct .
percutaneous catheter drainage is contraindicated in patients who are poorly compliant and cannot manage a catheter at home .
it is also contraindicated in patients with strictures of the main pancreatic duct and in patients with cysts containing bloody or solid material [ 28 - 30 ] .
6.2 .
surgical drainage in cases of failure of external percutaneous drainage radiologically , this approach is applied either by open method or by laparoscopy .
it can be a good option for the patients who cannot tolerate endoscopic drainage .
stoma is created between the most dependent part of the cyst and the adjoining stomach , jejunum , or ileum to provide effective drainage .
for surgical drainage , either lap or open method can be opted as both are effective for relief , but laparoscopic approach definitely carries low morbidity and mortality as compared to open techniques .
surgical drainage , which is increasingly done laparoscopically with a cholecystectomy if needed is the preferred mode then open approach .
external drainage of pseudocyst should only be carried out in case of emergency relief of severe symptoms and sepsis .
otherwise , eus or surgical drainage are the procedures of choice .
blind external drainage when duct status is unsure results in difficult - to - manage pancreatic fistulae [ 31 ] .
6.3 .
endoscopic drainage endoscopic drainage of pseudocysts is becoming the preferred therapeutic approach because it is less invasive than surgery .
the intervention done is minimal and avoids the need for external drain and has a high long - term success rate .
internal drainage is accomplished with either a transpapillary approach with ercp or direct drainage across the stomach or duodenal wall .
a transpapillary approach is preferable when the pseudocyst communicates with the main pancreatic duct , usually in the gene of the pancreatic duct .
this approach is also successful for patients with pancreatic duct disruption .
the endoscopic approach is guided by the presence of a bulge into the lumen of the stomach or duodenum in order to determine the entry site for catheterization .
this approach has several inherent risks , including missing the pseudocyst , injuring intervening vessels , and suboptimal placement of the drainage catheter [ 32 ] .
therapeutic echoendoscopes now make it possible to treat pseudocysts with eus - guided transmural stenting [ 33 ] .
several series have described the deployment of a 7 fr stent that is introduced with a needle - knife catheter [ 34 ] .
a new large - channel echoendoscope allows the use of 10 fr stent across the stomach or duodenum [ 35 ] .
in a large retrospective analysis of 603 patients who were undergoing eus - fna of pancreatic cysts , possible infection developed in only a single patient .
the majority of patients in this series ( 90 %) received antibiotic prophylaxis , most commonly a fluoroquinolone given for 3 days after the procedure , and this may possibly explain the low infection rate .
the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics before an fna of cystic lesions has not been evaluated by prospective randomized studies [ 36 ] .
the asge , in 2008 , published the guidelines for prophylactic use of antibiotics for gi endoscopy .
according to these guidelines , prophylaxis with an antibiotic , such as a fluoroquinolone , is administered before eus - fna of cystic lesions along the gi tract including pancreatic cyst .
antibiotics may be continued for 3 - 5 days after the procedure ( supported by observational studies ) .
the administration of antibiotic prophylax , a fluoroquinolone administered before the procedure and continued for 3 days after the procedure , is a reasonable regimen [ 37 ] .
cahen et al. concluded that endoscopic drainage is an effective treatment for pancreatic pseudocysts and offers a definitive solution in almost three - quarters of the cases .
the majority of the major complications might have been prevented by using pigtail stents instead of straight stents and by taking a more aggressive approach to the prevention and treatment of secondary cyst infection [ 38 ] .
final decision on eus versus surgical drainage is important and interesting as the decision making depends upon the profile of the patient .
it is important to know that multiple procedures are sometimes necessary to ensure adequate drainage .
also when there is a large amount of solid debris , eus drainage does not give good results .
there has been significant technical advancement in eus - guided drainage procedures with improved equipments and skill base .
it is certain that eus drainage will be more and more a preferred option over surgical drainage in the future too .
7. complications pancreatic pseudocyst needs close followup to early detect the most dreadful complications , which may be devastating if it remain unrecognized for long .
infection : infection occurs either spontaneously or after therapeutic or diagnostic manipulations .
while infected pseudocyst can initially be treated with conservative means , a majority of patients will require intervention .
traditionally , surgery has been the preferred modality but endoscopic treatment is gaining acceptance .
an external drainage may be necessary in selected situations such as when there is evidence of gross sepsis and the patient is too unstable to undergo surgical or endoscopic drainage [ 39 ] .
hemorrhage : hemorrhage can greatly complicate the course of a pseudocyst and can be devastating [ 40 ] .
the morbidity and mortality is very high because it can appear without warning and is usually due to erosion of a major vessel in the vicinity of the pseudocyst .
if not recognized immediately , life of the patient may be jeopardized .
interventional radiology can play an invaluable role both in locating the source of bleeding and in embolisation of the bleeding vessel [ 41 ] .
without prior information of the bleeding point , surgical exploration can be hazardous and challenging .
splenic infarction and thrombosis : complications of pseudocyst include massive hemorrhage into the pseudocyst , sepsis with splenic infarction , and splenic vein thrombosis .
the diagnosis of intrasplenic pseudocyst , based on clinical findings alone , is difficult to arrive at but should be suggested by the presence of a mass in the left upper quadrant .
sonography and computerized axial tomography may be particularly helpful in confirming splenic involvement .
selective celiac arteriography should be performed whenever splenic involvement is suggested in order to confirm the diagnosis and to search for pseudoaneurysm formation .
urgent surgical intervention is usually warranted in view of the high incidence of serious complications and the propensity toward rapid clinical deterioration .
resection of the pseudocyst by splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy is the treatment of choice [ 42 ] .
rupture : rupture of a pseudocyst can have either a favorable or an unfavorable outcome , and this depends on whether it ruptures into the gastrointestinal tract , into the general peritoneal cavity , or into the vascular system .
rupture into the gastrointestinal tract either results in no symptoms or leads to melaena or hematemesis that usually requires urgent measures .
rupture into the general peritoneal cavity results in features of peritonitis and occasionally hemorrhagic shock .
emergent surgical exploration is usually required .
while an internal drainage should always be aimed for , usually a thorough abdominal lavage and external drainage are all that can be achieved safely [ 43 , 44 ] .
biliary complications : biliary complications occur due to a large cyst in the pancreatic head region obstructing the common bile duct and resulting in obstructive jaundice .
therapeutic endoscopy with short - term biliary stenting is valuable in this situation .
it can be retained until either the pseudocyst resolves or is treated by intervention [ 45 , 46 ] .
portal hypertension : portal hypertension can result from compression or obstruction of the splenic vein / portal vein either by the cyst alone or by the cyst in conjunction with underlying chronic pancreatitis .
in this situation , surgery appears to be the only treatment modality available , and an appropriate surgical procedure can effectively treat this form of portal hypertension [ 47 ] .
gastric outlet obstruction : pseudocysts around the head of the pancreas are likely to cause gastric outlet obstruction .
once the features of gastric outlet obstruction develop , it needs certainly intervention and decompression or drainage of the cyst .
8. conclusion pancreatic pseudocysts are the most common cystic lesions of the pancreas , accounting for 75 % - 80 % of such lesions .
the most common symptoms are abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting , although they can be asymptomatic .
abdominal ct is an excellent choice for initial imaging .
eus plays an important role in differentiating pseudocyst from other cystic lesions of the pancreas and can greatly assist in transmural endoscopic drainage .
initial management consists of supportive care .
persistent symptoms and the development of complications warrant invasive intervention .
the endoscopic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures for the drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts are superior to open surgical techniques with respect to their success , morbidity , and mortality rates , but they cannot always be performed .
in making treatment decisions , it is important to recall that 50 % of pancreatic pseudocysts do not require any intervention and can be successfully managed by a wait - and - watch approach .
laparoscopic and endoscopic drainages have comparable success rates , while that of transcutaneous drainage are somewhat worse .
thus , the choice of technique depends very heavily on the experience of the treatment center .
the surgical , percutaneous , and endoscopic pseudocyst drainage procedures have not been directly compared in high - quality prospective randomized studies and the preferred approach varies based on patient preferences and local expertise .

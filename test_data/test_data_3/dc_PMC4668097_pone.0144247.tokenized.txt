objective gadoxetic acid disodium ( gd - eob - dtpa ) is a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) contrast agent to target the liver cells with normal function .
in clinical practice , the gd - eob - dtpa produces high quality hepatocyte specific image 20 minutes after intravenous injection , so dwi sequence is often performed after the conventional dynamic scanning .
however , there are still some disputes about whether dwi sequence will provide more effective diagnostic information in clinical practice .
this study aimed to explore the diagnostic value of combining gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) in patients with chronic liver disease .
methods a systematic literature search was performed in the pubmed and cochrane library database up to march 2015 .
the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies ( quadas ) was used to evaluate the quality of studies .
heterogeneous test on the included literature was performed by using the software review manager 5.3 .
the metadisc 1.4 software was used to calculate the pooled sensitivity , specificity , positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio ; meanwhile the summary receiver operating characteristics ( sroc ) curve was drawn to compare the diagnostic performance .
results a total of 13 literatures were included in this study .
in 8 literatures regarding hcc diagnosis based on gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri , the pooled sensitivity : 0.90 ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 0.88 - 0.93 ) ; specificity : 0.89 ( 95 % ci : 0.85 - 0.92 ) ; positive likelihood ratio : 8.60 ( 95 % ci : 6.20 - 11.92 ) ; negative likelihood ratio : 0.10 ( 95 % ci : 0.08 - 0.14 ) were obtained .
the area under curve ( auc ) and q values were 0.96 and 0.90 , respectively .
in 5 literatures relating to hcc diagnosis by combination of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi sequence , the pooled sensitivity : 0.88 ( 95 % ci : 0.85 - 0.91 ) , specificity : 0.96 ( 0.94 - 0.97 ) , positive likelihood ratio : 19.63 ( 12.77 - 30.16 ) , negative likelihood ratio : 0.10 ( 0.07 - 0.14 ) were obtained .
the auc value was 0.9833 and q value was 0.9436 .
the auc value of comprehensive evaluation method was significantly higher than that of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri alone ( p < 0.05 ) .
conclusion combination of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi sequence significantly improves in both the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of chronic liver disease - associated hcc .

introduction as a most common malignant tumors , hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc )' s mortality ranks third in all death of malignant tumors in developing countries [ 1 ] .
chronic liver disease including cirrhosis , is one of the most important factors contributing to the multistep progression of hepatocarcinogenesis , from benign regenerative nodules to early hcc , and finally to overt hcc [ 2 ] .
currently the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is primarily based on imaging .
gadoxetic acid disodium ( gd - eob - dtpa ) is a liver specific contrast agent with unique eob group , which can be uptake specifically by normal hepatocyte ( about 50 % uptake rate ) , thereby producing enhancement effect in liver cells 20 min after gd - eob - dtpa administration [ 3 ] .
therefore , it could provide useful information to distinguish abnormal hepatocytes ( including hcc ) from normal ones [ 4 ]. golfieri. r. et al had shown that eob - mri has the capability of identifying the hcc precursors and portraying their biological behaviors , thus rapidly becoming a key imaging tool for the diagnosis of hcc and its precursors [ 5 ] .
furthermore , one study demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) using gadoxetic acid provided more accurate diagnosis in discriminating focal nodular hyperplasia ( fnh ) from hepatic adenoma ( ha ) , identification of early hcc and pre - operative assessment of metastasis in liver parenchyma [ 6 ] .
diffusion - weighted imaging ( dwi ) can provide cellular information of hcc and also has been widely applied in lesion detection , lesion characterization , and assessment of treatment response to chemotherapeutic agents .
some researchers had revealed that diffusion - weighted mri can provide additional information to differentiate hcc from dn or other pseudotumoral lesions [ 7,8 ] .
actually , diffusion - weighted mri does provide enhanced diagnostic value in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions [ 9,10 ] .
recently , chen. j. et al had demonstrated that dwi had excellent and moderately high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of well - differentiated hcc and poorly - differentiated hcc , respectively [ 11 ] .
in clinical practice , the gd - eob - dtpa produces high quality hepatocyte specific image 20 minutes after intravenous injection , so dwi sequence is often performed after the conventional dynamic scanning for both shorten the duration of the examination as a whole and provide target cellular and architectural changes through the differences in tissue diffusivity .
saito k. et al research had shown that the injection of gd - eob - dtpa followed by scan of dwi sequence did not affect the enhanced hcc diagnosis by gd - eob - dtpa [ 12 ] .
there are still some disputes about whether dwi sequence will provide more effective diagnostic information in clinical practice .
some studies have shown that combined dwi sequences and hepatocyte specific contrast agent is conducive to differentiation of benign and malignant hepatic lesions [ 13 - 15 ] .
however , some recent reports suggested that the added dwi sequence cannot significantly improve detection efficiency of malignant liver disease [ 16 - 18 ] .
in this study , we performed meta - analysis in view of evidence based medicine , to make a comprehensive , objective and accurate evaluation on the hcc detection efficiency by combined application of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi sequences .
materials and methods literature search literatures were searched from pubmed , cochrane library database and reference as the main source of data , using terms combining any two keywords from (" diffusion - weighted magnetic resonance imaging " or " dwmri " or " dwi ") , (" gadoxetic - acid - enhanced mri " or " gd - eob - dtpa enhanced mri ") and (" hepatocelluar carcinoma " or " liver neoplasms ")( last search update to march 15 , 2015 ) .
literatures were screened from the title , abstract , intensive reading full - text , and reviews , comments , letters , animal models and case reports were excluded .
inclusion and exclusion criteria inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) english literature ; ( 2 ) subjects were patients with chronic liver disease with more than 30 cases ; ( 3 ) the objective of research was to evaluate hcc diagnostic efficiency in hepatocyte specific phase or combined application of hepatocyte specific phase and dwi ; ( 4 ) gold standard for hcc diagnosis was pathological examination or imaging follow - up ; ( 5 ) data analysis was based on the number of lesions , the original data can be directly or indirectly provided , and indicators for hcc diagnosis can be calculated , including the true positive ( tp ) value , false ( fp ) positive , false negative ( fn ) value , true negative ( tn ) value ; ( 6 ) the quality of literature was evaluated using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies ( quadas ) , and when there were more than 9 " yes " from a total of 14 questions , the literature can be incorporated into the study , when there were more than 4 " no " or " unclear " , the literature will be excluded [ 19,20 ] .
exclusion criteria : ( 1 ) review literature , system evaluation , letters , comments or animal models ; ( 2 ) in addition to hcc , the study object was also suffering from other malignant lesions ; ( 3 ) the research subject was less than 30 cases .
data extraction and quality evaluation data extraction was performed by three investigators independently who also performed the database searches , and any lack of clarity or disagreement was resolved through discussion .
the investigators abstracted data from each study to obtain information on author , publication year , sample size , number of lesions , characteristics of the study population ( age , gender ) , the size of the hepatocellular carcinoma , gold standard selection , types of liver disease and study design type ( prospective , retrospective ) , diagnostic method , equipment and directly or indirectly obtained indicators really positive ( tp ) value , false positive ( fp ) value , false negative ( fn ) value , true negative ( tn ) value , sensitivity ( se ) and specificity ( sp ) .
the quality of relevant studies were further evaluated using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies ( quadas ) tool .
it includes 14 items to assess risk of bias , source of variation and reporting quality .
the answer to each item was " yes ," " no ," or " unclear " .
statistical analysis review manager 5.3 software was used to analyze the heterogeneity of the research , and the q test was applied to calculate the inconsistency index i2 value .
due to the low sensitivity of cochrane q test , the significance level alpha = 0.1 was adopted for conservation [ 21,22 ] , and p > 0.1 indicates there is no statistical heterogeneity between studies , p < 0.1 indicates there is heterogeneity .
i2 was used to quantitatively evaluate heterogeneity , and when i2 < 25 % , fixed effect model was used for meta - analysis ; when 25 % < i2 < 50 % , random effect model was used ; when i2 > 50 % , the sources of heterogeneity was analyzed firstly , if there was no obvious clinical heterogeneity and the sources of heterogeneity cannot be found , the random effect model was used .
the metadisc 1.4 software was used to perform meta - analysis based on various indicators , including sensitivity ( se ) , specificity ( sp ) , positive likelihood ratio (+ lr ) , negative likelihood ratio ( - lr ) .
all indicators were represented as pooled results and the 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
in addition , the summary receiver operating characteristics ( sroc ) curve was constructed to make comprehensive evaluation on the diagnostic tests .
z tests was performed to determine the difference in auc between the two diagnostic methods , with p < 0.05 regarded as statistically significant .
in this paper , funnel plot was drawn to judge whether there is a publication bias .
if there is no bias , the graph is symmetric funnel shape .
on the contrary , any deviations in the graph prove the existence of publication bias .
however , there is no need for publication bias test for the diagnostic method from less literature .
results literature selection database was searched using keywords and the search scope was expanded by reference literature , and a total of 848 articles were obtained .
firstly , through extensive reading the title and abstract , a total of 769 literatures were excluded , including reviews , comments , letters and animal models .
after careful reading abstract , 45 articles were excluded .
then after intensive reading the full - text , other 21 articles were excluded .
finally this study included 13 articles , including 8 articles regarding hcc diagnosis based on gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri [ 23 - 30 ] , and 5 articles relating to hcc diagnosis by combination of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi sequence [ 31 - 35 ] .
the flow chart of the literature selection is shown in fig 1 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0144247.g001 fig 1 flow diagram of study selection .
data extraction and quality assessment this study included 13 literatures , with the case number of 945 ( 485 cases of evaluation on gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri , 460 cases of evaluation on combined application of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi ) , and total lesion number of 1385 ( 720 lesions of evaluation on gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri , 665 lesions of evaluation on combined application of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi ) .
detailed information of the included literature is shown in table 1 .
in addition , the various indicators obtained directly or indirectly from each study were shown in table 2 , including true positive ( tp ) value , false positive ( fp ) value , false negative ( fn ) value , true negative ( tn ) value , sensitivity ( se ) and specificity ( sp ) .
among 8 literatures of evaluation on gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri , there are 2 literatures with lesion size <= 3.0 cm [ 27,29 ] , 2 literatures used pathological diagnosis as the only gold standard [ 28,29 ] , and 2 literatures were prospective study [ 26,28 ] .
among 5 literatures of evaluation on combined application of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi , there was 1 literature with lesion size <= 3.0 cm [ 34 ] , and all 5 literatures used pathological diagnosis as the only gold standard .
in literature of lee mh et al [ 32 ] , only part of the patients underwent dwi , and detail characteristics ( age , gender ) and lesion size had not been record .
additionally , of the 5 literatures , 2 literatures [ 32,35 ] with b values of 0 and 800 sec / mm2 , 2 literatures [ 31,34 ] with 0 , 100 and 800 sec / mm2 , and 1 literature [ 33 ] with 1000 sec / mm2 .
hyperintense on dwi was considered as primary assessment criteria in sensitivity and specificity analysis for hepatocellular carcinoma , although apparent diffusion coefficient which is used to other analysis was calculated in one literature [ 35 ] .
one study [ 8 ] found dwi with b value of 1000 sec / mm2 has a sensitivity of 79.0 % according to the difference of signal intensity between liver lesions and adjacent hepatic parenchyma .
another research [ 34 ] demonstrated on b = 800 sec / mm2 images the sensitivity performed by different observers is 79.9 % , 77.7 % and 78.8 % respectively , which is similar to b = 1000 sec / mm2 images .
so , various b values have a little influence on the result of this research .
the evaluations on the design characteristics based on the quadas tool are shown in table 3 .

meta - analysis in 8 literatures regarding hcc diagnosis based on gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri , the pooled sensitivity : 0.90 ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 0.88 - 0.93 ) ; specificity : 0.89 ( 95 % ci : 0.85 - 0.92 ) ; positive likelihood ratio : 8.60 ( 95 % ci : 6.20 - 11.92 ) ; negative likelihood ratio : 0.10 ( 95 % ci : 0.08 - 0.14 ) were obtained ( fig 4 ) .
in 5 literatures relating to hcc diagnosis by combination of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi sequence , the pooled sensitivity : 0.88 ( 95 % ci : 0.85 - 0.91 ) , specificity : 0.96 ( 0.94 - 0.97 ) , positive likelihood ratio : 19.63 ( 12.77 - 30.16 ) , negative likelihood ratio : 0.10 ( 0.07 - 0.14 ) were obtained ( fig 5 ) .
as shown in fig 6 , in gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri group and combined gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi group , the area under the curve ( auc ) of sroc were 0.9595 and 0.9833 ; q * values were 0.9037 and 0.9436 , respectively .
the above data demonstrated that combined gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi group had higher specificity , with no overlapping 95 % confidence intervals , the positive likelihood ratio reached 19.63 with practical significance , and auc value , the comprehensive evaluation index of diagnosis test , was higher than gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri group ( p = 0.019 ) .
the negative likelihood ratio and sensitivity were similar between two groups .

discussion to the best of our knowledge , this is the first meta - analysis on the diagnostic performance of hcc using mr imaging with gd - eob - dtpa and dwi sequence .
after systematic review and evaluation , this study included 13 literatures , among which 8 is to evaluate gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri , and 5 is to comprehensively evaluate gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri and dwi sequence in diagnosis of chronic liver disease associated hcc .
in diagnostic method of combined evaluation , the pooled specificity was significantly higher than that in gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri , suggesting that the diagnostic methods greatly reduce misdiagnosis rate .
in addition , the pooled positive likelihood ratio reaches 19.63 , which indicates that the possibility of hcc is very high , if the diagnosis of the suspected cases is positive .
however , one single index cannot reflect the whole test reaction , with only reference value .
sroc curves , which are used to make a full and accurate evaluation on the diagnostic tests , are drawn according to the ratio of various studies .
the results show that combined evaluation of gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri and dwi has higher auc value than gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri alone ( p < 0.05 ) .
this indicates the combined diagnostic method can acquire more diagnostic information and make more accurate evaluation of hcc in chronic liver disease .
to investigate heterogeneity is the key to understand the possible factors affecting the estimation accuracy , and whether it is appropriate to evaluate combination of different studies .
threshold effect is one of the important causes for the heterogeneity of the diagnostic tests [ 39 ] .
threshold analysis was performed in studies on hcc diagnostic evaluation by combined diagnostic method and gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri alone , and the spearman rank correlation coefficient were - 0.429 ( p = 0.289 ) and - 0.700 ( p = 0.188 ) , respectively .
this result indicates that the heterogeneity among sensitivity , specificity , positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio was not caused by the threshold effect .
subsequently , mate regression analysis was performed on literatures evaluating diagnostic value by gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri , to explore the sources of heterogeneity [ 39,40 ] .
evaluation covariates included case number , lesion number , lesion size , average age , the experiment design type and the equipment .
the results showed that the above covariates were not sources of heterogeneity ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 4 ) , which might be caused by limited number of the included literatures .
due to small number of included literatures in the comprehensive evaluation method , it is not suitable for mate regression analysis .
although the source of heterogeneity is not found , the combined statistics obtained from this study still have some reference value .
on evaluation hcc diagnosis by gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri , the pooled sensitivity and specificity of our study are similar to those of wu lm [ 41 ] , with more precise 95 % confidence interval .
in the specificity analysis of the combined evaluation method , p value was 0.23 and i2 value was 28.6 % , which indicates the results was homogeneous and have reference value .

combination of gd - eob - dtpa - enhanced mri and dwi sequence has considerable significance in the diagnosis of hcc .
several studies reported that most hccs with various degree of differentiation demonstrate hypointensity on gadoxetic - acidenhanced hbp images , which was due to the change in expression of oatp1b3 , a liver - specific human drug transporter [ 3,42 ] .
however , early - enhancing non - tumorous ( en ) hepatic lesions may occasionally present with hypointensity during the hepatocyte phase , thus causing a diagnostic dilemma [ 43 ] .
in addition , in clinical practice , hccs frequently demonstrate atypical and inconclusive enhancement patterns different from the characteristic enhancement pattern of typical hccs , and this may cause a delay in diagnosis [ 44 ] .
recently the japan society of gastroenterology and hepatology has proposed clinical practice guidelines and suggested that a nodular lesion showing an atypical imaging pattern on dynamic ct should be further examined by gadoxetic acid - enhanced mr imaging or contrast - enhanced ultra - sonography [ 45 ] .
inchingolo r et al. reported that suspicion should be raised for hcc , or at least high - grade dysplastic nodules ( hgdn ) , when existing hyperintensity on dwi , especially in association with hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase , and low lesion - to - liver ratios , thus helping the characterization of atypically enhancing lesions [ 35 ] .
also , one study demonstrated that hyper - intensity on both t2wi and dw imaging are conducive to the diagnosis of hypervascular hccs smaller than 1 cm [ 46 ] .
therefore , the addition of dw imaging to gadoxetic acid - enhanced mr imaging could be a promising strategy for both detection and characterization of hcc .
additionally , the authors of one recent research [ 33 ] suggest that a comprehensive evaluation using gadoxetic acid - enhanced mri including a gradient dual - echo sequence and dwi is superior to ctap / ctha for the pre - therapeutic detection of hcc , regardless of nodule size .
compared with other meta - analysis of diagnostic tests , this study has the following advantages : ( 1 ) in comprehensive evaluation on hcc diagnosis by gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri and dwi , all the gold standard was pathological examination ; ( 2 ) all included literatures are acquired after detailed and clear literature screening process , and all cases had a history of chronic liver disease ; ( 3 ) before meta - analysis , heterogeneity analysis was performed using review manager 5.3 software , and to ensure homogeneity between various included studies ; ( 4 ) more detailed data extraction was performed in all literatures for in - depth analysis and research .
the limitations of this study are as follows : firstly , the number of included literatures is limited ; especially there are only 5 literatures on comprehensive consideration method .
though the included literature was small , the total number of subjects was up to 945 cases , including 460 cases with comprehensive consideration method. of the total 1385 lesions , 665 lesions were diagnosed by comprehensive consideration method .
all literatures were screened by quadas tools , with high quality and representative for each study .
secondly , most included literatures were retrospective studies , with only 2 prospective studies .
however , the final diagnosis was not known for all researchers in the process of imaging diagnosis .
in addition , the gold standard used was pathological examination or imaging follow - up , which was in accordance with the clinical diagnostic criteria , and can make accurate judgments of hcc .
conclusion compared with gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri , combined evaluation method increases diagnosis accuracy and specificity of hcc in chronic liver disease .
further studies with larger sample remain to be needed to investigate diagnostic value in hcc by combined application of gd - eob - dtpa - enhance mri and dwi .

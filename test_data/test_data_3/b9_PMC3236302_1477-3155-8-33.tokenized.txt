background understanding the endocytosis process of gold nanoparticles ( aunps ) is important for the drug delivery and photodynamic therapy applications .
the endocytosis in living cells is usually studied by fluorescent microscopy .
the fluorescent labeling suffers from photobleaching .
besides , quantitative estimation of the cellular uptake is not easy .
in this paper , the size - dependent endocytosis of aunps was investigated by using plasmonic scattering images without any labeling .
results the scattering images of aunps and the vesicles were mapped by using an optical sectioning microscopy with dark - field illumination .
aunps have large optical scatterings at 550 - 600 nm wavelengths due to localized surface plasmon resonances .
using an enhanced contrast between yellow and blue ccd images , aunps can be well distinguished from cellular organelles .
the tracking of aunps coated with aptamers for surface mucin glycoprotein shows that aunps attached to extracellular matrix and moved towards center of the cell .
most 75 - nm - aunps moved to the top of cells , while many 45 - nm - aunps entered cells through endocytosis and accumulated in endocytic vesicles .
the amounts of cellular uptake decreased with the increase of particle size .
conclusions we quantitatively studied the endocytosis of aunps with different sizes in various cancer cells .
the plasmonic scattering images confirm the size - dependent endocytosis of aunps .
the 45 - nm - aunp is better for drug delivery due to its higher uptake rate .
on the other hand , large aunps are immobilized on the cell membrane .
they can be used to reconstruct the cell morphology .
background gold nanoparticles ( aunps ) are important nanomaterials in biomedicine where they can be used to achieve drug delivery and photodynamic therapy [ 1 - 6 ] .
for biomedical applications , a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of aunp cellular entry and exit is required .
in previous studies , the endocytosis of aunps was found to be not only dependent on the surface coating but also on particle size [ 7 - 12 ] .
in these studies , aunps were observed by using electron microscopy or fluorescent optical microscopy .
several drawbacks are inherent in these methods , since cells are not alive when they are observed by electron microscopy , and fluorescent labelling suffers from problems with photobleaching .
long - term observation is not attainable by the fluorescent technique .
additionally , quantitative estimation of aunp numbers in cells is not easy using fluorescent signals .
in this paper , we present a label - free method for long - term tracking of the movement of aunps with different sizes .
a three - dimensional ( 3d ) image process was developed to identify the distribution of aunps .
using the 3d distribution , the uptake efficiencies for different sizes of aunps were compared .
the label - free method was based on the large difference between the scattering spectra of aunps and cellular organelles .
aunps are known to have broad optical absorption / scattering for visible and near - infrared light due to the excitation of localised surface plasmon resonance ( lspr ) .
the scattering cross - section of a nanoparticle is usually described by the mie scattering theory [ 13,14 ] .
( 1 ) cs ( lambda )= 32pi3lambda44r4n4 [ epsilonr ( lambda ) - n2 ] 2 + epsiloni2 ( lambda )[ epsilonr ( lambda )+ 2n2 ] 2 + epsiloni2 ( lambda ) where r is the radius of the nanoparticle , lambda is the incident wavelength , n is the refractive index of environmental medium and epsilon r and epsilon i are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of the nanoparticle , respectively .
the aunp has a negative dielectric constant .
large scattering occurs when epsilon r ( lambda ) = - 2n2 .
in an aqueous environment ( n = 1.332 ) , the wavelength for maximum scattering is about 550 - 600 nm. on the other hand , the dielectric constant of cellular organelles is positive .
the scattering efficiency is proportional to ( 1lambda ) 4 .
the shorter wavelength has a larger scattering .
the large spectral difference makes different colours for aunps and celluar organelles .
for example , figure 1 shows the calculated spectra for a 50 nm aunp and a 1 mum diameter dielectric sphere ( epsilon r = 1.342 ) in an aqueous medium .
the nanometre aunp has a comparable scattering intensity with the micrometre sphere , but the single 50 nm aunp shows as yellow and the dielectric sphere shows as blue .
when endocytosis of aunps occurs , the aunps are surrounded with a dielectric coating .
the scattering image is visualised as an orange centre with a blue periphery .
the insets of figure 1 are the measured scattering images for a 45 nm aunp and a micrometre vesicle .
the aunps in vesicles can be directly identified by the coloured scattering images .
such spectral differences can be used to distinguish aunps from cellular organelles .
in this paper , we proposed an image processing method to identify the 3d distribution of aunps in living cells .
the endocytosis of aunps with different sizes , including 45 nm , 70 nm and 110 nm , were compared .
figure 1 the scattering spectra for different nanoparticles .
the particles were 50 - nm - aunp and a 1 - mum dielectric sphere in water medium .
the inset shows the measured scattering images for single vesicle , aunp and vesicle containing aunps .
the nanometer - size aunp has a comparable scattering intensity with microspheres .
however , the aunp shows yellow color and the vesicle shows blue .
when endocytosis of aunps happens , the aunps became orange with blue surroundings .
the optical scattering images can be used to identify the uptake of aunps .
materials and methods dark - field optical sectioning microscopy the 3d scattering images of aunps and cellular organelles were mapped by using a dark - field optical sectioning microscope [ 15 ] .
for long - term observation of the cells , the microscopic system was put in a chamber to maintain a 37degreesc humidified atmosphere .
figure 2 illustrates the optical setup .
the light source was a 60 w metal halide lamp which illuminated the samples through a hemispheric glass lens .
the incident angle was larger than the critical angle between glass and air .
therefore , only scattering light could be collected by the objective lens .
the lens ( 100x , na = 1.35 ) was mounted on an objective piezo nano - focusing system .
for 3d images , the scattering images at different focal planes were taken by a fast scan of the objective along the depth direction .
the nano - focusing system was controlled by a function generator which generated a voltage ramp to move the objective .
a trigger signal was simultaneously sent to the frame grabber to begin recording a sequence of ccd images .
in dark - field sectioning microscopy , the voltage from the controller was 20 v. it made a 16 mum movement from the focal position .
the scan frequency was 0.5 hz. the ccd acquisition time was 50 ms , yielding 40 images during a scan .
figure 2 the optical setup of a dark - field optical section microscope .
the light source was a 60 w metal halide light .
it illuminated the samples through a hemisphere glass lens .
the illumination light had a large incident angle in the medium , only the scattering light was collected by the objective lens and imaged by a color ccd .
we recorded the scattering images at different focal positions by using a quickly linear scan of the objective lens along the depth direction .
the left image is a dark - field ccd image for a hela cell without any aunps .
cells and incubation in the experiments , we studied the interactions of aunps with two kinds of cancer cells , non - small lung cancer cells ( cl1 - 0 ) and hela cells .
both cells have lateral dimensions of about 20 mum and heights about 8 mum .
these cells were cultured on cleaned glass slides with thin square chambers to hold the medium .
they were maintained in rpmi medium ( gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fbs ( fetal bovine serum ) ( gibco ) at 37degreesc in a humidified atmosphere .
the cells were cultured for 24 hours to ensure that they adhered well onto the glass slides .
the left image in figure 2 shows a dark - field ccd image for a hela cell without any aunps .
this image indicates that no colorful spots are in the cell .
the ring patterns are the micrometre vesicles .
fabrication of aunps aunps were prepared by using the reduction of chloroauric acid ( h [ aucl4 ]) solution [ 16,17 ] .
different diameters of aunps were made by using different ratios of chloroauric acid and reducing agent .
the fabrication parameters for different sizes of aunps were listed in table 1 .
we used the sem to determine the mean aunp size and its size dispersion .
additional file 1 shows the sem images for 13 nm , 45 nm , 70 nm and 110 nm aunps on glass substrates .
we used the measurement function in the sem ( leo - 1530 ) to measure the diameter for each nanoparticle .
about 100 nanoparticles were measured for each size .
the mean size and size dispersion of the aunp are listed in table 2 .

for aunps without ligands , they cannot interact with cells .
the unmodified aunps will be on the glass substrate [ 18 ] .
to make aunps interacting with cancer cells , we modified the aunp surface with single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) sequences .
the dna sequence was sh - ( ch2 ) 10 - gcagttgatcctttggataccctgg , where the thiol group enabled covalent bonding between the ssdna and gold surface .
this ssdna segment was an aptamer for cellular surface mucin glycoprotein ( muc1 ) which is over - expressed in the extracellular matrix of cancer cells [ 19 - 22 ] .
it is noted that in the preparation of aunps , the sodium citrate acted as a reducing agent .
the negatively - charged citrate ions were adsorbed on the gold nanoparticles , introducing negative surface charges .
it is known that dnas also carry negative charges .
if dna aptamers were immobilised on the aunp surface , it made the surface charge more negative .
we used a zeta - potential analyzer ( brookhaven 90plus ) to measure the surface potential .
the electrostatic potential on the particle surface is called the zeta potential .
in the measurement , we applied unit field strength ( 1 volt per metre ) to the aunp solution .
the electrophoretic mobility of aunps was measured based on dynamic light scattering .
there are theories that link electrophoretic mobility with zeta potential .
the calculated zeta potentials for different size of aunps are listed in table 2 .
it can be seen that after the interaction with dna aptamers , the aunps increased negative surface charges .
it confirmed that the dna aptamers were immobilised on the aunp surface .
preparation of aunp aggregates in submicron holes when endocytosis of aunps occurs , the aunps are wrapped by the vesicles .
the vesicle size are most in submicron scale and the aunps in the vesicle are in aggregated form .
to find the relation between the scattering optical intensity and number of aunps in the vesicle .
we prepared 500 - nm - diameter holes in a transparent film to mimic the vesicles .
the transparent film was coated on a glass substrate .
the glass surface was modified with 4 - mercaptobenzoic acid , sodium borohydride , hydrogen peroxide ( 27.5 wt % solution in water ) and 3 - aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( aptes ) in order to immobilize the aunps [ 23 ] .
the sample was dipped in the aunp solution .
after six hours of interaction time , we washed the sample and measured the scattering images in water .
the measured sample was then dried and observed by the sem to identify the number of aunps in each hole .
results cell - nanoparticle interactions we studied the interactions of aunps with two kinds of cancer cells , non - small lung cancer cells ( cl1 - 0 ) and hela cells .
additional file 2 shows a movie for 70 nm aunps and cl1 - 0 cells for different interaction times .
in this experiment , the 70 nm aunps were first injected into the cell chamber .
after ten minutes , new culture medium was injected to the chamber to wash the unbounded aunps .
the images were then recorded by the colour ccd with an exposure time of 100 ms. the interval between images was 5 minutes and the overall recording time was 1.5 hours .
this movie shows the aptamer - modified aunps attached to the ecm and moving towards the cells .
few vesicles were found during this period .
most aunps were not taken up by the cells , but instead moved directly to the apical surfaces of the cells .
to identify the positions of aunps , the sample was scanned over different cellular heights .
figure 3 shows the dark field ccd images at different times and heights of the cell .
it confirmed that many aunps were attached to the apical surface without being internalised .
figure 4 shows the images for 110 nm aunps taken at different heights of the cell .
the interaction time was two hours .
the 110 nm aunps were visualised as strong orange spots in the dark field image .
there were almost no vesicles found in the cells .

the 110 - nm - aunps show strong orange spots in the dark - field image .
there were almost no vesicles found in the cells .
most of the 110 - nm - aunps were on the cells .
the scale bar is 10 mum .
the behaviour of 45 nm aunps was quite different from 70 nm and 110 nm aunps .
additional file 3 shows a movie for 45 - nm - aunps interacting with cl1 - 0 cells .
the interval between images was 5 minutes and the overall recording time was 2 hours .
this movie shows the aptamer - modified aunps attached to the ecm and moved towards the cells .
however , it was found that many aunps did not attach to the apical surface of the cell .
instead , they entered the cells through endocytosis and accumulated in endocytic vesicles .
figure 5 ( a ) shows the images at different interaction times .
the numbers of vesicles containing aunps increased with time .
figure 5 ( b ) shows the enlarged scattering image of 45 nm aunps and vesicles containing aunps .
the aunps were visualised as yellow .
when they were endocytosed , the aunps were visualized as orange surrounded with blue. from the above movies and images , the movement and uptake of 45 nm and 70 nm aunps are depicted in figure 5 ( b ) .
many 45 nm aunps moved into the cells and then entered cells through endocytosis , while many 75 nm aunps only moved along the cell surface .

( b ) an enlarged image of figure 5 ( a ) for 120 minutes interaction time .
the aunps showed yellow colors .
when they were uptaken by the cell , the aunps became orange with blue surroundings .
the picture demonstrated the movement and uptake of aunps for 45 nm and 70 nm aunps .
many 45 - nm aunps are moved and then uptaken by cells , while many 75 - nm - aunps only moved to the apical surface of the cells .
3d distribution of aunps we found that different sizes of aunps interact with cells differently .
the uptake rate can be quantitatively estimated by mapping 3d distributions of aunps .
in these experiments , we used the difference of scattering spectra to distinguish aunps and cellular organelles .
for example , figure 6 ( a ) shows a colourful scattering image .
the cell was a cl1 - 0 cell and the aunp size was 45 nm. a single aunp shows as a yellow spot in the scattering image .
there are other brighter regions in the cell due to the scattering of organelles .
to exclude the organelles and identify the positions of aunps , we divided the image into the colours red ( r ) , green ( g ) and blue ( b ) .
the ( g + r )/ 2 image yielded a yellow image ( y ) which had a stronger scattering intensity for aunps as seen in figure 6 ( b ) .
on the other hand , the organelles were brighter in the blue image ( figure 6 ( c )) .
if we applied the image process of ( y - b ) , the colour image then became a grey image which was positive for aunps and negative for organelles , as shown in figure 6 ( d ) .
aunps in this grey image were easily identified using computer - based image analysis .

there are white brighter regions appeared in the cell due to the scattering from large organelles .

compared both images , the aunps have a higher contrast in the yellow image .
the organelles is brighter in the blue image .
( d ) the combination of the y and b images by using the ( y - b ) calculations .
the image process results in an image with bright aunp spots and dark organelles .
the unit is mum .
in this work , we developed a matlab program to find the 3d positions of aunps in the cell .
first , the colour images at different focal planes ( z ) were transformed into gray images by using the ( y - b ) algorithm .
then the gray images for different focal planes were all projected onto the same x - y plane .
in the processed images , only aunps show bright spots .
the central position of every bright spot was recorded as the x - y position ( xp , yp ) of aunps .
the z position ( zp ) for each aunp was then determined by finding the maximum scattering intensity , i ( xp , yp , zp ) along the z - direction at a fixed ( xp , yp ) position .
the computer program calculated the spot one by one .
at last , all the ( xp , yp , zp ) points rendered the 3d distribution of aunps .
figure 7 ( a ) shows the 3d distribution of 45 nm aunps in a cl1 - 0 cell. from this figure , it can be seen that many 45 nm aunps were located in the cytoplasm and at the bottom of the cell .
figure 7 ( b ) shows the 3d distribution of 70 nm aunps in a cl1 - 0 cell .
the image indicates that many 70 nm aunps were located on the cell surface .
it indicates that morphology of the cell can be reconstructed by these large aunps .

( b ) the calculated 3d image for 70 - nm - aunp aggregates distribution on a hela .
quantitative calculation of the endocytosis to quantitatively calculate the uptake numbers of aunps , we have to know the aunp number at each ( xp , yp , zp ) position .
it is noted that previous endocytosis studies by electron microscope have shown that aunps mostly localise in vesicles ( 300 to 500 nm in size ) and most of the aunps are in aggregated form [ 9 ] .
because the limited spatial resolution of the optical microscopy , the number of aunps in each aggregate cannot be simply identified by the optical images .
nevertheless , the scattering intensity i ( xp , yp , zp ) for each aggregate is different .
the scattering intensity is increased with the aunp number in the aggregate .
to estimate the aunp numbers in each aggregate , calibration curves between the scattering intensities and the corresponding aunp numbers have to determined .
in the experiment , we put different sizes of aunps in an array of 500 - nm - holes .
the scattering of aunps in the hole can be used to mimic the scattering of aunp aggregate in the vesicle .
the preparation of the samples were described in the method section .
figure 8 ( a ) shows the measured scattering images and the corresponding sem images for different aggregates of 45 - nm - aunps .
we found that the scattering intensity was increased with the number of aunps .
using the curve presented in figure 8 ( b ) and the measured scattering intensity i ( xp , yp , zp ) for the aunp aggregates , we can quantitatively estimate the aunp numbers at each ( xp , yp , zp ) position .
figure 8 the scattering intensity as a function of aunp numbers .
( a ) the measured optical scattering images and the corresponding sem images for different aggregates of aunps .
( b ) the scattering intensities as a function of aunp numbers .
the scattering intensity was increased with the number of aunps .
the uptake rate of aunps was defined by the number of aunps in the cell divided by the total number of aunps .
the total aunp number was obtained by summing up aunp numbers for all aggregates .
the aunp number on the cell was calculated by manually locating the aunp positions ( xp , yp , zp ) on the cell from the 3d distribution as seen in figure 7 .
the number on the cell was then calculated by summing up the aunp numbers for the selected ( xp , yp , zp ) positions .
the number of aunps in the cell was obtained by subtracting the aunp number on the cell from the total aunp number .
figure 9 ( a ) shows the statistical results for cl1 - 0 cells using aunps 45 nm , 70 nm and 110 nm in diameter .
the statistical results show that the total amount of aunps which interacted with cells had a maximum value for 45 nm aunps .
the total amount is consistent with the result measured by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy [ 11 ] .
the amount for 45 nm aunps was about five times higher than for the 70 nm aunps .
we used the 3d images to estimate the aunps in or on the cells .
the percentage of aunps in cells also had a maximum value for the 45 nm aunps , demonstrating that about 58 % of the aunps entered the cells .
the cellular uptake was deceased for large aunps , to about 43 % for 70 nm aunps and almost zero for 110 nm aunps .
the same property of endocytosis was also found for hela cells , with the statistical results shown in figure 9 ( b ) .
the percentage of aunps in hela cells also had a maximum value for the 45 nm aunps , which was 61 % inside the cells .
it was about 23 % for 70 nm aunps and almost zero for 110 nm aunps .
these results verified that 45 nm aunps are better than larger - sized aunps for uptake into cancer cells .
figure 9 the statistical results for the uptake of different aunps .
( a ) cl1 - 0 cells and ( b ) hela cells for aunps of 45 nm , 70 nm and 110 nm diameters .
the statistics show that the total amounts of aunps interacted with cells has a maximum value for 45 - nm - aunps .
the percentage of aunps in cells also has a maximum value for 45 - nm - aunps .
the n indicates the number of cells investigated .
discussion the reason for size - dependent endocytosis of aunps can be explained by the thermodynamic model of the many - np - cell system [ 24 - 26 ] for receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 27,28 ] .
there are two kinds of competitive energy important for endocytosis of nanoparticles ( nps ) .
one is the binding energy between ligands and receptors .
this energy refers to the amount of ligand - receptor interaction and the diffusion kinetics for the recruitment of receptors to the binding site .
the other is the thermodynamic driving force for wrapping .
the thermodynamic driving force refers to the amount of free energy required to drive the nps into the cell .
these two factors determined how fast and how many nps are taken up by the cell .
for nps with a diameter smaller than 40 nm , the docking of a single small np will not produce enough free energy to completely wrap the nps on the surface of the membrane .
this could prevent the uptake of the single np by endocytosis .
for the smaller nps to go in , they must be clustered together and thus take a long diffusion time .
therefore , the uptake amount is much smaller than 50 nm nps .
for nps with a diameter larger than 80 nm , endocytosis rarely occurs .
the depletion of free receptors limits the ligand - receptor binding energy for forming a large membrane curvature .
almost all nps are only partially wrapped in the membrane. between both regions , the optimal np diameter has been identified at which the cellular uptake of nps is maximised [ 29 - 31 ] .
the optimal diameter for aunps falls in the range of 40 - 60 nm for reasonable values of membrane bending rigidity and ligand - receptor binding energy .
in the optical scattering study of aunps and cells , we investigated particle sizes from 45 nm to 110 nm. aunps can be prepared as small as 5 nm. however , it is hard to identify small nanoparticles in the cells simply by using scattering images .
as indicated in eq .
1 , the scattering cross - section is greatly reduced when particle diameter is reduced .
for aunps with a diameter smaller than about 30 nm , the scattering signal will be smaller than the micron - sized vesicles and is hard to be identified .
therefore , the proposed 3d scattering method is suited only for medium - sized aunps. with this particle size , the scattering signals of vesicles and aunps are comparable .
it should be noted that these medium - sized aunps are of great interest than other sizes of aunps for endocytosis studies .
previous experiments using tem and fluorescence microscopy have all indicated that aunps with a size of 40 - 60 nm have the best cellular uptake efficiency [ 7 - 10 ] .
for small and large aunps , most remain bound to the membrane .
hence , for drug delivery by aunps , this proposed method is very useful for long - term tracking of the process of endocytosis without any labelling .
conclusions we studied endocytosis of aunps with different sizes ( 45 nm , 70 nm and 110 nm ) in various cells ( the human cancer cell lines , cl1 - 0 and hela ) .
compared with previous methods using transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy , the proposed method provides a simple way to define whether aunps are in the cytoplasm or adhered to the membrane of living cells .
using the spectroscopic difference between aunps and cell organelles , a colour ccd with a simple post - process can easily identify the positions of aunps. from the 3d distributions of aunps , we have experimentally confirmed that endocytosis of aunps is size dependent .
for the cells we studied , the optimal size for the uptake into cells was around 45 nm. these results suggest that a particle size of 45 nm has the highest efficiency for drug delivery by aunps .
on the other hand , large aunps which remain bound to the cell membrane can be used to reconstruct the morphology of the cell .

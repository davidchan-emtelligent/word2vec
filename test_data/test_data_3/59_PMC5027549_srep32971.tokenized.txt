immature dendritic cells ( imdcs ) play an important role in establishing tolerance but have limitations , including potential for maturation , short lifespan in vivo and short storage times in vitro .
however , exosomes ( generally 30 - 100 nm ) from imdcs ( imdex ) retain many source cell properties and may overcome these limitations .
in previous reports , imdex prolonged the survival time of heart or intestine allografts .
however , tolerance or long - term survival was not achieved unless immune suppressants were used .
regulatory t cells ( tregs ) can protect allografts from immune rejection , and our previous study showed that the effects of imdex were significantly associated with tregs .
therefore , we incorporated tregs into the treatment protocol to further reduce or avoid suppressant use .
we defined the optimal exosome dose as approximately 20 mug ( per treatment before , during and after transplantation ) in rat liver transplantation and the antigen - specific role of tregs in protecting liver allografts .
in the co - treatment group , recipients achieved long - term survival , and tolerance was induced .
moreover , imdex amplified tregs , which required recipient dcs and were enhanced by il - 2 .
fortunately , the expanded tregs retained their regulatory ability and donor - specificity .
thus , imdex and donor - specific tregs can collaboratively induce graft tolerance .
life - long use of immune suppressants is necessary in organ transplantation to suppress immune rejection and prolong allograft survival .
however , non - specific effects of these suppressants lead to an increased occurrence of opportunistic infection and cancer recurrence .
donor - specific tolerance , if established effectively , could avoid the use of these suppressants and eliminate these side effects .
immature dendritic cells ( imdcs ) serve as immune system sentinels by sensing environmental and inflammatory signals , and they play an essential role in the maintenance of immune tolerance .
in particular , imdcs play a key role in dictating the outcome of immune responses by influencing the balance between the inflammatory response and the regulatory t cell ( treg ) response .
at the centre of this immunological balance is finely regulated crosstalk between dcs and tregs , whereby tregs modulate dc phenotypes and functions and dcs drive tregs differentiation .
imdcs and tregs alone or in combination can effectively prolong allograft survival time123 .
however , dc - based technology has deficiencies that limit its application in the clinic , including potential maturation , short - term lifespan in vivo , a seven - day production requirement , and the inability to be preserved long - term in vitro45 .
dcs can release small ( approximately 30 - 100 nm in diameter ) membrane - enclosed vesicles ( exosomes ) derived from the internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies ( mvbs ) into the extracellular milieu , which have been proposed to play an efficient role in antigen presentation , immune regulation and signal transduction .
some reports , including our previous study , revealed that the administration of donor exosomes from imdcs ( imdex ) before transplantation prolonged the survival time of heart or intestine allografts678 .
however , it is not clear whether imdex could work in liver transplantation .
moreover , immune tolerance or long - term graft survival was not achieved in past reported treatment protocols with imdex unless immune suppressants were used at the same time .
tregs are known to protect skin , cardiac and renal allografts from immune rejection910 and the effects of imdex in vivo demonstrated a close relationship with tregs in our previous study as well as others'4811 .
therefore , we incorporated tregs into the combined treatment protocol to further reduce or avoid the use of suppressants .
there are on - going controversies as to whether donor antigen specificity is needed for tregs in transplantation immune regulation .
thus , we treated recipients with different dosages of donor - derived imdex and / or different donor - specific tregs and observed the immune regulatory effects in vitro and in vivo .
results dex isolation and identification we obtained exosomes from imdcs ( imdex ) and from mdcs ( mdex ) as described in the methods .
electron microscopy results of exosomes revealed typical image of heterogeneous vesicles ( 30 - 120 nm in diameter ) 12 ( fig. 1a,b ) .
the exosomes were analysed by fcm ( flow cytometry ) , and typical imdex and mdex phenotypic profiles are shown in fig. 1c / d. lower levels of cd80 , cd86 , mhc class i and mhc class ii were expressed on imdex than on mdex ( compared with mean fluorescence intensity , in fig. 1d ) .
these exosomes were in agreement with those described in previous reports811 .
obtaining and identifying donor - specific tregs cd4 + cd25 + t cells were sorted by magnetic isolation from the spleens of lewis rats .
cd4 + cd25 + cells comprised 89.1 +/ - 2.9 % of this fraction , as shown in fig. 2a / b and supplementary table s1 .
when gated on cd4 + cd25 + cells ( fig. 2a ) , foxp3 + cells were 68.5 +/ - 2.9 % , and cd127 + cells were 12.9 +/ - 1.4 % ( fig. 2a / b and supplementary table s1 ) .
the cd4 + cd25 + cells from lewis rats were co - cultured with il - 2 and 1 x 106 gamma - irradiated ( 20 gy , 2,000 rad ) sdcs ( dendritic cells isolated from spleen ) from brown norway ( bn ) rats for 14 d. the co - cultured cd4 + cd25 + t cells , which often expanded 2 - to 5 - fold , were prepared for fcm analysis .
gated on cd4 + cd25 + cells , the foxp3 expression rate was 86.9 +/ - 3.0 % ( supplementary table s1 ) ( increased from the previous cd4 + cd25 + fraction , p = 0.0114 , n = 3 , fig. 2a / b ) , and cd127 expression was 7.2 +/ - 1.0 % ( supplementary table s1 ) ( decreased from the fresh isolated cd4 + cd25 + fraction , p = 0.0334 , n = 3 , fig. 2a / b ) .
the co - cultured cd4 + cd25 + t cells were similar to those described in previous reports in mice and humans1314 .
to further clarify the status of these two fraction cells , we also detected ctla - 4 , ki67 and icos ( supplementary fig. s1 ) and found co - cultured cd4 + cd25 + t cells expresses those molecules ( expressed ctla - 4 , ki67 and icos , meanwhile with higher expression of ki67 compared with fresh isolated cd4 + cd25 + cells , p < 0.05 , n = 3 ) , which suggested that this co - cultured cd4 + cd25 + cells might be active and had the potential for immune regulation .
they were then ready for therapeutic administration .
functional assays were performed with pre - activated cd4 + cd25 + cells as suppressors , cfse - labelled lewis cd8a + t cells as responders , and bn sdcs as stimulators .
as the amount of cd4 + cd25 + t cells decreased , the proliferation of cd8a + t cells increased , which suggested a dose - dependent suppression of cd8a + t cell proliferation ( fig. 2c / d ) .
this suppression was donor - specific , as dose - dependent suppression was not seen when the suppressors were f344 sdc pre - activated cd4 + cd25 + t cells or fresh isolated cd4 + cd25 + t cells .
to further clarify this finding , we measured the production of ifn - gamma and found that ifn - gamma was similarly inhibited by the pre - activated cd4 + cd25 + t cells in a dose - dependent and donor - specific manner ( fig. 2e ) .
thus , we had obtained tregs with donor antigen - specific suppression activity ( donor - specific tregs ) 1516 .
administration of donor imdex in combination with donor - specific tregs prolonged liver allograft survival we first analysed the effects of different doses ( 1 , 10 , 20 , 40 or 80 mug ) of imdex injected via the caudal vein 7 d before , the day of , and 7 d after transplantation ( fig. 3a ) .
the 10 , 40 and 80 mug group survival times were significantly longer than the untreated group ( mst : 17 d for 10 mug , p = 0.0241 , n = 9 ; 25 d for 40 mug , p = 0.0008 , n = 9 ; 26 d for 80 mug , p = 0.0011 , n = 9 ) .
however , the longest allograft survival time was obtained in the 20 mug group ( mst : 37 d , n = 9 ) , and it was significantly increased compared with the 10 mug group ( p = 0.0087 , n = 9 ) , 40 mug group ( p = 0.0498 , n = 9 ) and 80 mug group ( p = 0.0441 , n = 9 ) ( fig. 3a / table 1 ) , indicating that 20 mug ( per treatment of three ) was the optimal dosage .
we tested the effects of 20 mug of imdex derived from bn , f344 or lewis rats .
only imdex derived from donor rats significantly prolonged the recipient survival times compared with the untreated group ( mst : 14 d for lewis , p = 0.1754 vs. untreated group , n = 9 ; 15 d for f344 , p = 0.1159 vs. untreated group , n = 9 ; fig. 3b / table 1 ) , indicating that the effect was donor specific .
three types of tregs ( lewis - derived fresh tregs , lewis - derived bn - specific tregs , and lewis - derived f344 - specific tregs ) were injected into recipients at a dose of 2 x 106 via the caudal vein 7 d before , the day of , and 7 d after transplantation ( fig. 3c / table 1 ) .
the recipient survival times in the bn antigen - specific tregs - treated group were longer than in the untreated groups ( mst : 34 d vs. 10 d , p < 0.0001 , n = 9 ) .
the f344 antigen - specific tregs and fresh tregs also prolonged graft survival times compared with the untreated group ( mst : fresh tregs group vs. untreated group = 18 d vs. 10 d , p = 0.0081 , n = 9 ; mst : f344 - specific group vs. untreated group = 19 d vs. 10 d , p = 0.006 , n = 9 ) , but not to the same degree ( fresh tregs group vs. bn - specific group , p = 0.01 , n = 9 ; f344 - specific group vs. bn - specific group , p = 0.0032 , n = 9 ) , suggesting that tregs prolong graft survival time with donor specificity .
to further improve allograft survival time , we co - injected 20 mug of donor imdex with donor - specific tregs , as imdcs have been reported to work with tregs in vivo and in vitro8171819 .
while the msts of recipients from the imdex and tregs - alone treatment groups reached 37 d and 34 d , respectively , the combination of donor imdex with donor - specific tregs induced the long - term survival of liver allografts ( 6 recipients survived over 100 d , p = 0.007 compared with the 20 mug imdex group , n = 9 ; p = 0.0083 compared with the bn - specific tregs group , n = 9 ) ( fig. 3d / table 1 ) .
furthermore , we also combined donor imdex with fresh isolated tregs as a control group , and the mst of this group reached 47 d ( p = 0.0386 , n = 9 , compared with the experimental group ; p = 0.283 , n = 9 , compared with the 20 mug imdex group ) ( fig. 3d / table 1 ) , which suggested that it matters that the combined tregs were donor - specific , for the extended survival time in the experimental group compared with the imdex alone group .
infiltrating cells and rejection symptoms in allografts were reduced to evaluate the degree of allograft rejection , we harvested grafts on days 0 , 10 , 35 and 100 after transplantation .
the rejection activity index ( rai ) according to the banff schema was used as the standard to evaluate rejection severity in each group .
haematoxylin and eosin ( he ) staining showed that the levels of infiltrating inflammatory cells varied in different groups and on different days ( fig. 4a ) .
the 0 - day grafts from each group showed normal results .
on the 10th day , the graft pathology results showed different degrees of degeneration and necrosis in liver parenchyma cells in the four groups .
he staining of the untreated group revealed obvious inflammatory cell infiltration , hepatic lobule structural disorder and severe intravascular dermatitis ( fig. 4a ) .
the rai was 8.3 +/ - 0.3 , and the rejection was severe ( fig. 4b ) .
recipients in the 20 mug imdex treatment group and the donor - specific tregs treatment group ( fig. 4a / b ) showed similar lymphocytic infiltration in portal areas ; the banff classification was moderate ( rai of the imdex group was 5.0 +/ - 0.6 and of the tregs group was 5.3 +/ - 0.3 ) .
the 20 mug bn imdex / bn - specific tregs co - treatment group ( fig. 4a / b ) exhibited a very small amount of mononuclear cell infiltration and the banff grade was undefined .
the rai ( 0.7 +/ - 0.3 ) was significantly reduced ( fig. 4b ) compared with the other three groups ( untreated group : p < 0.001 , n = 3 ; imdex treated group : p < 0.001 , n = 3 ; donor - specific tregs group : p < 0.001 , n = 3 ) .
on the 35th day , a large number of infiltrating cells and chronic rejection symptoms such as biliary atresia and cholestasis appeared in the imdex and tregs treatment groups .
however , no chronic rejection symptoms appeared in the co - treatment group ( fig. 4a ) on the 35th day .
in this group , inflammatory cell infiltration into the grafts was reduced compared with the imdex or tregs treatment groups .
the rai was 6.7 +/ - 0.3 ( co - treatment vs. imdex alone , p < 0.01 , n = 3 ; co - treatment vs. tregs alone , p < 0.05 , n = 3 ) ( fig. 4c ) .
these results showed that 20 mug of bn imdex combined with bn - specific tregs could reduce immune rejection in liver allografts .
on the 100th day , the co - treatment group grafts exhibited fibrous regeneration and hepatic lobule structural disorder , but mononuclear cell infiltration was reduced ( fig. 4a ) .
the banff grade was undefined , and the rai was 1.3 +/ - 0.3 , which was significantly reduced ( fig. 4d ) compared with the 35 - day grafts ( rai = 6.7 +/ - 0.3 , p < 0.001 , n = 3 ) .
the 10 - , 35 - and 100 - day pathology changes suggested that co - treatment reduced rejection and helped receipt livers regenerate after undergoing slight acute rejection .
recipient immune responses were suppressed in a donor - specific manner to explore the immune statue in recipients , we assessed the anti - donor cellular response in recipients after transplantation .
as described in the methods , 5 x 104 purified t cells ( isolated from splenocyte harvested 10 d after transplantation from recipients ) were incubated with 5 x 104 irradiated sdc ( stimulator cells ) derived from either donors ( bn ) or other allogeneic donor ( f344 ) .
as shown in fig. 5a / b , total t cells from co - treated rats displayed a significant decrease in proliferation against bn sdcs compared with t cells from untreated recipients ( p < 0.001 , n = 3 ) , 20 mug bn imdex - treated recipients ( p < 0.001 , n = 3 ) and bn - specific tregs - treated recipients ( p < 0.001 , n = 3 ) .
however , total t cells from all four groups proliferated almost equally with the f344 sdcs used as stimulator cells ( fig. 5a / b ) .
furthermore , we observed that the ifn - gamma levels in the t cell / donor sdc co - culture supernatant were similarly inhibited in a donor - specific manner ( co - treatment group vs. untreated group : p < 0.01 , n = 3 , bn sdcs as stimulators , fig. 5c ; co - treatment group vs. untreated group : p > 0.05 , n = 3 , f344 sdcs as stimulators , fig. 5c ) .
these results demonstrated that the immune response of t cells in co - treated recipients was inhibited .
tregs distribution in the recipients to study the distribution of tregs in vivo , we designed an independent test with cfse - labelled tregs .
twelve extra recipients accepted liver transplantation and four different treatments in the same dosage regimen described above , except that cfse - labelled tregs were used .
on the 10th day after transplantation , liver grafts , mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens were harvested for immunofluorescence .
as shown in fig. 6a - c , cfse - labelled tregs were distributed in these organs in the bn - specific tregs treatment group and the co - treatment group .
in liver grafts , we found that the number of cfse + cells in the co - treatment group was significantly higher than in the bn - specific tregs treatment group ( p = 0.0413 , n = 48 , fig. 6d ) .
in mesenteric - draining lymph nodes and spleens , similar results were observed ( lymph nodes , p = 0.0105 , n = 48 ; spleens , p = 0.0310 , n = 48 ; fig. 6e / f ) .
therefore , imdex might promote the proliferation of tregs , which will enhance regulatory effects of tregs in vivo , similar to imdcs1719 .
exploring the mechanism of the synergistic effects of donor imdex and donor - specific tregs with in vitro and in vivo assays we hypothesized that the infused exosomes were the reason why cfse - labelled tregs were increased in the co - treatment group .
to verify this , we implemented in vitro tregs proliferation assays .
we used 2 x 104 lewis sdcs as " assistance cells " and 200 units / ml il - 2 as an " assistance cytokine " .
as shown in fig. 7a , no considerable proliferation was observed in the untreated group , imdex group or lewis sdc group .
however , treg proliferation was increased in the imdex / lewis sdc group compared to the imdex group ( p < 0.001 , n = 3 ) or the lewis sdc group ( p < 0.001 , n = 3 ) , indicating that imdex can amplify tregs in vitro and that dcs are essential for this effect .
when il - 2 was added to the administration protocol , treg proliferation increased compared to the imdex / lewis sdc group ( p < 0.05 , n = 3 ) , suggesting that il - 2 improved the ability of imdex to expand tregs .
next , we performed treg suppression assays with the expanded tregs .
a dose - dependent suppression of cd8a + t cell proliferation is shown in fig. 7c / d. the expanded tregs were still donor - specific , as dose - dependent suppression was not seen when f344 sdcs were used as stimulators ( fig. 7c / d ) .
in the ifn - gamma inhibition assays , we observed similar results ( fig. 7e ) .
these results suggested that imdex - expanded tregs maintain their regulatory ability and do not lose donor specificity .
imdex was injected into lewis rats via the caudal vein along with cfse - labelled tregs to detect proliferation of exogenous tregs in vivo .
on the 10th day after transplantation , cd4 + cd25 + t cells were isolated from spleens with magnetic sorting and analysed by fcm ( fig. 7f / g ) .
the cfse fluorescence intensity was undetectable in the no treatment and 20 mug bn imdex treatment group .
the percentage of divided cfse - labelled tregs was analysed .
in the imdex / tregs co - treatment group , the treg proliferation rate was higher than in the tregs treatment group ( p = 0.0025 , n = 3 , fig. 7g ) .
these results suggested that imdex also amplifies tregs in vivo .
discussion our results confirm that the combined use of proper doses of donor imdex and donor antigen - specific tregs can induce rat liver allograft tolerance without the need for immunosuppressive agents .
this active tolerance could be detected in cell mixing experiments in vitro ( fig. 5 ) and survival analysis / pathology analysis in vivo ( figs 3 / 4 ) .
meanwhile , we found that exogenous tregs were widely distributed in liver grafts , spleens , and mesenteric lymph nodes ( fig. 6 ) and that imdex could amplify tregs .
recipient dcs were essential for this imdex function , and il - 2 was also helpful ( fig. 7 ) .
fortunately , the expanded tregs retained their regulatory ability and specificity , remaining tenable in the in vivo assay , which may explain the synergistic effect and the induction of tolerance by tregs and imdex ( fig. 7 ) .
imdcs can inhibit immune rejection2021 , and exosomes have many advantages , including their stable nature and easy storage .
we therefore added imdex to our treatment protocols to verify whether imdex can function similarly to imdcs in liver recipients .
we found that the most effective imdex dosage ( 20 mug at one of three time points ) prolonged the rat liver survival time , which is consistent with previous reports11 .
however , the optimal exosome dosage varies between studies and is not even described in some reports622 ; these differences may be due to the use of different animals , diverse models , various exosome sources or different dose gradient designs .
in the in vivo assay , we verified that only donor - derived imdex ( 20 mug at one of three time points ) prolonged recipient survival time , which is consistent with previous imdex studies823 .
however , this finding appears contradictory to those using dcs , as it was reported that infusion of either donor - 20242526 or recipient - derived2728 dcs with tolerogenic properties prolonged allograft survival time .
considering that there are at least two properties underlying the tolerogenic function of dcs , including " inherently tolerogenic properties " ( clonal deletion , inhibition of t effector cells , and the expansion or induction of tregs ) and " negative cellular vaccines " 21 ( donor - derived tolerogenic dcs have donor antigen but do not induce rejection ) , we believe that donor - derived tolerogenic dcs with the " negative cellular vaccine " property may have some advantages and may work with relatively low cell numbers .
indeed , our results indicated that donor - derived imdex may also possess the " negative cellular vaccine " property .
however , we did not compare imdex and mdex in our study , which may be a limitation .
after magnetic bead isolation and incubation with donor sdcs , the foxp3 + rate slightly increased , consistent with previous studies1719 .
however , the cd127 + rate decreased ( fig. 2a / b ) .
while cd8a + cytotoxic t cells play an important role in the cellular immune response to transplantation , we observed that sdc - expanded tregs could inhibit these responses , including proliferation and the production of inflammatory cytokines , with donor specificity ( fig. 2c - e ) , indicating that sdc - expanded tregs have the potential to inhibit the allograft rejection reaction .
although there are some controversies surrounding treg specificity293031 , we found that donor - specific tregs did prolong the liver allograft survival time in a donor - specific manner ( fig. 3c / table 1 ) .
therefore , we argue that donor specificity is important for tregs in both the in vitro suppression response and the in vivo regulation of immune rejection for transplantation models .
combined treatment with donor imdex and donor antigen - specific tregs led to long - term survival ( six of nine recipients in the co - treatment group survived over 100 d ) .
however , in the untreated group , the mst was 10 d. in the imdex or tregs treatment groups , the mst was 37 or 34 d , respectively ( fig. 3 , table 1 ) .
these results suggest that in the co - treatment group , acute rejection was delayed and relatively slight compared with the other groups and the findings of another study32 .
the pathological results of combined treatment also showed a relatively delayed and slight acute rejection ( fig. 4 ) , and at 100 d after transplantation , we observed considerable regeneration .
we then isolated total t cells from recipients and found that their proliferation and ifn - gamma production were both reduced in a donor - specific manner .
together , these results demonstrate that allograft tolerance was achieved .
to explore exogenous tregs distribution , we administered cfse - labelled tregs to recipients and found they were widely distributed in liver grafts , spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes .
interestingly , in the imdex / cfse - labelled tregs group , the number of exogenous tregs was significantly higher than in the cfse - labelled tregs group ( fig. 6 ) .
we speculate that imdex amplified the exogenous tregs , and this phenomenon may explain the synergistic effects in the co - treatment group .
to verify this hypothesis , we performed in vitro treg expansion assays ( fig. 7a / b ) .
in these assays , imdex amplified tregs only when sdcs were incubated in this system ( fig. 7a / b ) , confirming our and morelli 's conjecture .
morelli reported4 that imdex works with dcs in vivo and speculated that this mechanism underlies the effects of imdex in vivo .
these results also suggest that imdex expands tregs in a similar manner to dcs , as donor dcs function in recipients with recipient dc assistance , and deletion of recipient dcs deters the therapeutic effect of donor dcs , as was reported by wang .
however , the mechanism of interaction between exosomes and assistant dcs has not been fully clarified .
genally speaking , there are two types of hypotheses : i ) exosomes directly fuse with the membranes of assistant dcs or bind on the surface of dcs333435 , so that intact donor mhc molecules can present on recipient dcs and directly interact with effector cells by means of a " direct recognition pathway " 19 ; ii ) exosomes are endocytosed by recipient dcs , and donor mhc molecules and antigen peptides will be presented by assistant dcs3637 .
in this way , exosomes only interact with effector cells by means of classic " indirect recognition pathway " .
it remains unknown which pathway is dominant in donor imdex inducing recipient tregs proliferative response .
next , we found that il - 2 improved the ability of imdex to expand tregs , which is similar to the dcs expanding assays reported by yamazaki16 showing that il - 2 improved the ability of allogeneic dcs to amplify tregs .
furthermore , we analysed the proliferation rate of cfse - labelled tregs in vivo and found that treg proliferation increased with imdex treatment .
this result confirms that imdex can expand tregs both in vitro and in vivo .
however , due to a lack of effective methods , we could not verify the mechanism of interaction between imdex and recipient dcs .
we also did not explore whether imdex interacted with a wider range of cells .
in conclusion , imdex plays an immune regulatory role in rat liver transplantation .
our results identified the optimal dose for imdex administration and further verified that treg antigen specificity is critical for immune regulation in allogeneic rat transplantation .
furthermore , the combined use of both imdex and tregs induced liver allograft tolerance , and imdex amplified tregs most likely through binding / fusing with recipient dcs and being presented by recipient dcs , which could be enhanced by il - 2 .
synergistic effects between imdex and tregs may explain why the co - treatment group survived longer than imdex or tregs treatment groups .
as liver allograft tolerance was induced and imdex possesses some advantages over imdcs , this study provides a new method for the regulation of transplantation immunity for clinical work .

spleen dcs were isolated from donors or recipients with anti - dc ( ox62 ) beads as per the instructions .
exosome preparation exosomes were isolated from mdc and imdc supernatants ( imdc supernatants at 6 and 11 d were pooled to obtain greater output ) using an exosome isolation kit ( life technologies , carlsbad , california , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the pellet was then re - suspended with saline .
approximately 15 mug of exosomes were harvested from 1 x 107 mdcs or imdcs .
the exosome amount was evaluated based on the amount of protein using the bradford assay .
then , exosomes were stored at - 80 degreesc for future use .
flow cytometry as previously described8 , except that aldehyde / sulfate latex beads were purchased from thermo fisher scientific ( waltham , ma , usa ) .
the beads attached to the two types of exosomes were stained with fitc - mhc class i , fitc - mhc class ii , pe - cd80 or pe - cd86 antibodies .
beads stained with fitc and pe isotype antibodies formed the control groups .
cd4 + cd25 + t cells and cd8a + t cells were stained with fitc - cd4 , pe - cd25 , apc - foxp3 , unconjugated cd127 , alexa fluor 680 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit igg and fitc - cd8 antibodies as described in the product specifications .
then , the beads or cells were assessed by fcm using a facscalibur ( bd immunocytometry systems , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) , and data were analysed with flowjo 7.6 .
electron microscopy as described by meckes39 , the sample was diluted ten times , loaded onto a copper grid at room temperature , and examined with a cm120 philips biotwin electron microscope ( phillips electronic instruments ) .
orthotopic liver transplantation , infusion therapy and survival time recording surgical procedures were performed as kamada40 described .
in this procedure , we used bn rats as liver donors , f344 rats as other allogenic donors and lewis rats as allograft recipients .
cuffs were used .
no immunosuppression was given to recipient rats in this study .
different doses of imdex and / or exogenous tregs ( 2 x 106 per time - point ) , either unlabelled or labelled with 10 / 20 mum cfse ( ebioscience , san diego , ca , usa ) , were transferred via caudal injection 7 d before , the day of , and 7 d after transplantation .
recipients that died within 3 d were regarded as technical failures and excluded from further analysis .
on day 0 , 10 , 35 and 100 after transplantation , three recipients were sacrificed for he analysis and / or anti - donor cellular response assays .
these animals were excluded from the survival analysis .
if needed , extra transplantation was carried out to ensure 9 recipients in each group .
recipient survival times were recorded and analysed , and the experiment ended after 100 d or 60 d. mixed leukocyte reactions in the treg suppression assay , fresh tregs , lewis - derived bn / f344 antigen - specific tregs and cfse ( 5 mum ) - labelled cd8a + t cells were obtained and co - cultured at various treg / cd8a + t cells ratios ( bn sdcs as stimulator cells , irradiated by 20 gy / 2,000 rad gamma - ray ) in 200 mul of t cell medium in a 96 - well round - bottom plate at 37 degreesc .
starting cell numbers were 5 x 104 tregs , 5 x 104 cfse - labelled cd8a + t cells , and 5 x 104 stimulator cells .
different numbers of tregs were added later .
five days later , cfse intensity was measured by fcm , and the rate of divided cfse - labelled cells was analysed with flowjo 7.6 and recorded as proliferation rate .
the expanded treg suppression assays were carried out as mentioned above , except that the expanded tregs were used as suppressor and bn / f344 sdcs were used as stimulator .
in the recipient leukocyte proliferation assay , as described by peche11 , 5 x 104 lewis total t cells , purified from recipients' spleencytes by rat t cell enrichment column kit ( r & d , minneapolis , mn , usa ) , were labelled with 5 mum cfse and were added to 96 - well round - bottom plates with equal numbers of irradiated sdcs derived from bn / f344 .
five days later , cfse intensity was measured and analysed as mentioned above .
the ifn - gamma levels in this culture supernatant were determined using the rat ifn - gamma elisa kit purchased from neobioscience ( beijing , china ) .
histological examinations liver grafts harvested on day 0 , 10 , 35 and 100 after transplantation were fixed for 72 h , embedded in paraffin , sectioned at 6 mum and stained with he for histological examination .
the rai according to the banff schema3241 was used to evaluate allograft rejection .
an independent test was designed with cfse - labelled tregs ( 20 mum cfse , 10 min at room temperature ) in which 12 extra recipients received liver transplantation and four different treatments ( no treatment , 20 mug of imdex , cfse - labelled bn - specific tregs or imdex / cfse - labelled tregs co - treatment. each group contained 3 recipients. ) .
on the 10th day after transplantation , sample fragments were snap - frozen in oct ( tissue - tek , elkhardt , in , usa ) , cut into 8 - mum sections , and stained with dapi .
treg proliferation assays in vitro and in vivo we cultured 1 x 104 lewis - derived bn - specific tregs ( 5 mum cfse labelled ) in 96 - well plates and incubated them with 0.5 mug of bn imdex , 2 x 104 lewis sdcs and / or il - 2 ( 200 units / ml , recombinant rat il - 2 purchased from peprotech , rocky hill , nj , usa ) .
seven days later , proliferation was analysed .
in the in vivo assays , tregs were labelled with 10 mum cfse .
after 10 min at room temperature , the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of fcs , followed by washing in pbs .
a total of 2 x 106 tregs were injected as described above .
ten days after transplantation , cd4 + cd25 + t cells were isolated from recipient splenocytes by magnetic sorting .
gated on the cd4 + cd25 + cd127 - cfse + cell subset , the percentage of divided cfse - labelled tregs was analysed .
statistics the data points in the line graphs and bar graphs represent the mean +/ - sem or mean + sem , respectively .
data were expressed as the means +/ - standard error of means ( sem ) and analysed using student 's two - tailed t test for comparison between two groups , one way anova for comparison among more than two groups or the log - rank test for survival analysis .
values were analysed using graphpad prism 5.0 ( graphpad , san diego , ca , usa ) .
the results were deemed statistically significant if the p - value was < 0.05 .
statistical significance is indicated in each figure where applicable .

this paper presents the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles ( ag nps ) in aqueous medium .
this method was performed by reducing agno3 in different stirring times of reaction at a moderate temperature using green agents , chitosan ( cts ) and polyethylene glycol ( peg ) .
in this work , silver nitrate ( agno3 ) was used as the silver precursor while cts and peg were used as the solid support and polymeric stabilizer .
the properties of ag / cts / peg nanocomposites ( ncs ) were studied under different stirring times of reaction .
the developed ag / cts / peg ncs were then characterized by the ultraviolet - visible ( uv - vis ) spectroscopy , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectroscopy .
silver nanoparticles nanocomposites chitosan polyethylene glycol green chemistry 1 .
introduction nanoscale materials are structures ranging from 1 to 100 nm , as defined in the chemistry context , which have contributed to the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology at an exponential rate in recent years [ 1 ] .
nanomaterials often have a significant degree of difference in physico - chemical and biological properties to their macroscale counterpart in spite of the similar chemical compositions they possess [ 2 ] .
silver nanoparticles ( ag nps ) have emerged as one of the most intensively studied areas in the field of nanotechnology due to their well - known effectiveness in biomedical [ 3 ] , electronic [ 4 ] , catalytic [ 5 ] and optical applications [ 6 ] .
many methods have been established in preparing metal nanoparticles , such as chemical reduction [ 7,8 ] , electrochemical [ 9 ] , irradiation [ 10,11 ] and thermal decomposition [ 12 ] , as well as the green chemistry route [ 13 ] .
huang et al .
[ 14 ] reported the synthesis of different metal - chitosan nanocomposites ( ncs ) in aqueous solution by the reduction of corresponding salts with nabh4 .
the green synthesis is a concept that is introduced to define the method used in synthesis , which is favored over solvent medium .
this is because it is environmentally friendly and contains a reducing agent that is benign to the environment .
besides , it also utilizes a non - toxic stabilizer in forming ag nps [ 15,16 ] .
in addition , wei et al .
[ 17 ] also carried out research on cts - based silver ncs by reducing silver nitrate ( agno3 ) salts with non - toxic and biodegradable cts .
it appeared that the exclusion of nabh4 in the synthesis made it " greener " as compared to the method reported by huang et al .
[ 14 ] .
in the process of synthesizing nanoparticles , a stabilizer is used to control the formation and dispersion stability of metal nanoparticles .
for this purpose , polymers have been widely used as a particle stabilizer to control the particle growth , stabilize the metal dispersions and limit the oxidation of the particle [ 18,19 ] .
a number of researchers have reported on the synthesis of polymer - silver ncs with numerous polymers [ 20 ] .
notably , cts is a natural cationic biopolymer obtained from deacetylation of natural chitin , which consists of polymeric beta - ( 1,4 ) - 2 - amino - 2 - deoxy - d - glucose [ 21,22 ] .
due to its excellent biocompatibility , biodegradability , non - toxicity and bioactivity properties , cts has gained much attention .
the fact that it is a potential polysaccharide resource makes its use preferable [ 23 ] .
polyethylene glycol ( peg ) is a water - soluble polymer with a general formula h ( och2ch2 ) noh .
it is widely used in the mechanical as well as pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries .
peg is also a good stabilizer for ag nps based on the conclusions made by several research studies as mentioned in this paper [ 24 - 26 ] .
in one of these research works , luo et al. reduced agno3 in the presence of peg .
the researchers suggested that stabilization can be obtained due to the free polymer chains in solution , where formation of aggregates is denied because of steric hindrance. from their observation , they also proposed that increasing the molecular weight of the polymer would help in forming stable ag nps [ 27 ] .
the chemical reduction method is commonly used to prepare ag nps in industrial applications because of its great advantages in generating high yields and readiness to perform the method [ 28 ] .
however , this method is one of the conventional methods that employs many chemical agents , and thus , making it hazardous to environment .
following this , the green synthesis method is much more suitable to be used in preparing ag nps as it is relatively more environmentally friendly .
hence , based on the principle of green synthesis [ 29 ] , cts and peg were used as the stabilizer and solid support to prepare the silver nanoparticles in this work .
in this work , we proposed the green synthesis method by reducing agno3 with different stirring times at a moderate temperature for the preparation of silver nanoparticles .
the influence of the stirring times on the optical properties , structures and morphologies of silver nanoparticles was characterized by the ultraviolet - visible ( uv - vis ) spectroscopy , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) .
2. results and discussion in this work , the reaction mechanism was proposed following the equations ( 1 - 2 ) below : ( 1 ) cts / peg + ag + - - >[ ag / cts / peg ]+ ( 2 ) [ ag / cts / peg ]+ - - > different stirring timest = 60degreesc [ ag / cts / peg ] vin this project , cts solution was first mixed with peg solution to form cts / peg solution .
cts / peg then reacted with the ag + ion to form metallopolymer [ ag / cts / peg ]+ ( equation 1 ) .
this metallopolymer was stirred at a moderate temperature of 60 degreesc according to varying stirring times to form ag / cts / peg nanocomposites ( equation 2 ) .
in this process , ag + was successfully reduced to ag0 to form ag nps .
2.1 .
optical properties as shown in figure 1 , the color of the prepared agno3 / cts / peg solution at different stirring times progressively changed from colorless to light brown , subsequently to brown , and eventually to dark brown .
this phenomenon indicates the formation of ag nps in the ag / cts / peg ncs solution [ 30 ] .
the formation of ag nps in the nanocomposites was further determined by using the uv - visible spectroscopy , which was shown on the surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) bands .
figure 2 shows that ag nps started to form when agno3 / cts / peg was allowed into reaction at a moderate temperature as there was no peak at 0 h and the absorbance peak could be seen at different stirring times after the reaction started .
generally , the spr bands are influenced by the size , shape , morphology , composition and dielectric environment of the prepared nanoparticles [ 31,32 ] .
previous studies have shown that the spherical ag nps contribute to the absorption bands at around 400 nm in the uv - vis spectra [ 33 ]. from this research , the spr band characteristics of ag nps were detected around 415 - 430 nm ( figure 2 ) , which strongly suggests that the ag nps were spherical .
this can be confirmed by the tem results. from figure 2 , as the stirring time of the nanocomposites increased , the intensity of the spr peak also showed gradual increment .
this shows that the reduction of the silver ions to silver atoms was continued and resulted in an increase in the concentration of ag nps [ 34 ] .
however , there is an exceptional case in this situation for the spr absorption band for the particles , which disagreed with the tem results , whereby blue - shifts were observed as size decreased from d = 19.37 +/ - 4.98 nm and turned to red - shifts when nearing d = 5.50 +/ - 1.33 nm. this can be explained by the multi - layer mie theory model , which theorizes that the chemical interaction caused the lowered electron conductivity in the outermost atomic layer , and consequently caused the red - shifts [ 35 ] .
as seen from the figure , it can be observed that 48 h had very large absorbance compared to 24 h because the size of silver nanoparticles was a lot larger than those at 24 h. this phenomenon could be due to the fact that , after reaching a certain size , the stabilizer was not able to withhold the nanoparticle 's size effectively , which resulted in its very large size .
hence , the increase of size from 12 h ( 5.50 nm ) to 24 h ( 6.45 nm ) was very small as compared to the increase from 24 h ( 6.45 nm ) to 48 h ( 19.37 nm ) as demonstrated by the tem .
2.2 .
x - ray diffraction characterization the typical x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns of the pure cts , pure peg , cts / peg and the prepared ag nps are shown in figure 3 .
pure cts showed two peaks at 2theta of 9.37degrees and 19.56degrees while pure peg showed strong reflections at 2theta of 19.23degrees and 23.34degrees and weak reflections at 13.61degrees and 27.32degrees .
in cts / peg film , the 9.37degrees reflection for chitosan is diminished which may indicate that the crystallinity of chitosan is decreased .
the diffraction of peg tended to cover the reflection of chitosan with increasing reflection at 19.13degrees in cts / peg film .
therefore , it was observed that cts / peg showed strong reflections at 2theta of 19.13degrees and 23.20degrees .
for ag / cts / peg ncs , the xrd peaks at 2theta of 37.91degrees , 43.71degrees , 64.06degrees and 76.98degrees were characteristics to the ( 111 ) , ( 200 ) , ( 220 ) , and ( 311 ) planes of the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) of ag nps , respectively [ 36 ] .
the peaks showed that the main composition of nanoparticles was silver and no obvious other peaks present as impurities were found in the xrd patterns .
therefore , this gives clear evidence for the presence of ag nps in the ag / cts / peg ncs .
2.3 .
electron microscopic analysis figure 4 presents the transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) images and the particle size distribution for ag / cts / peg ncs with different stirring times of reaction. from the tem results , the prepared sample with a longer stirring time had a broader particle size distribution .
as seen from figure 5 , the ag / cts / peg ncs with the stirring time of 48 h had a broad size distribution and a mean diameter of 19.37 +/ - 4.98 nm ( figure 4c ) .
as the stirring time of reaction decreased , the mean diameter of ag nps decreased dramatically to 6.45 +/ - 2.32 nm and 5.50 +/ - 1.33 nm for 24 h and 12 h , respectively ( figure 4b and 4a ) .
there was a large significant increase in the particle size as compared to the samples with the stirring times of 24 h and 12 h. this was due to the fact that , when the time of reaction increased , the particle aggregation was being promoted to form larger particles [ 37 ] .
these results showed that the diameters of ag nps were influenced by the stirring time of reaction .
the results also revealed that the stirring time of 12 h was the optimum in order to obtain the smallest particle size of ag nps .
the scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) images of ag / cts / peg ncs with the stirring times of 12 , 24 and 48 h , respectively ( a - c ) are presented in figure 5 .
the image reveals the surface structure of ag / cts / peg ncs , which changed under different stirring times of reaction .
under a stirring time of 12 h , small - flake surfaces presented separately in the exterior morphology of ag / cts / peg ncs .
however , with the increased stirring time of reaction , larger flake surfaces presented in the ag / cts / peg ncs .
this phenomenon shows that , under longer stirring times of reaction , ag / cts / peg ncs with better compatibility were produced .
2.4 .
fourier transform infrared characterization figure 6 shows the fourier transform infrared spectra for peg , cts , cts / peg , and ag / cts / peg ncs for the stirring time of 48 h. for the spectrum of peg , the spectral band appeared at 3463 cm - 1 for o - h stretching vibrations , 2889 cm - 1 for c - h stretching vibrations , and 1469 and 1342 cm - 1 for c - h bending vibrations .
the absorption bands at 1283 to 1083 cm - 1 were due to the stretching vibrations of the alcoholic o - h and c - o - c ether linkage .
on the other hand , as for the cts spectrum , the absorption bands at 3380 and 3317 cm - 1 were due to the overlapping of o - h stretching and n - h stretching bands , 2901 cm - 1 was due to the aliphatic c - h stretching , 1650 and 1606 cm - 1 were due to n - h bending , 1436 and 1385 cm - 1 were due to c - h bending , 1335 cm - 1 was due to c - n stretching , and finally , 1080 and 1053 cm - 1 were due to the overlapping of alcoholic c - o stretching band and ether linkage , as well as the c - o - c stretching band .
the cts / peg spectrum showed the combination of the ir absorption characteristic of peg and cts .
the peaks of the overlapping o - h and n - h bands , aliphatic c - h and - nh2 groups in pure cts were shifted to 3387 , 3308 , 2891 , 1660 , 1579 cm - 1 , respectively , in cts / peg .
this was due to the deformation vibration of the amine group in cts [ 38,39 ] .
few significant changes were observed in the ag / cts / peg spectrum as compared to the cts / peg spectrum , except for the little shift in the spectrum and the disappearance of the peak at 1287 cm - 1 for cts / peg .
the disappearance of the small peak at 1287 cm - 1 was replaced by the appearance of medium peak at 1346 cm - 1 in the ag / cts / peg spectrum , which was due to the complexation between cts / peg and agno3 to form metallopolymer [ ag / cts / peg ]+ .
the schematic representation of the ag / cts / peg ncs synthesized from agno3 / cts / peg by the green synthesis method is shown in figure 7 .
the scheme represents the possible interactions between agnps and cts / peg based on the results predicted from the ftir spectra .
3. experimental section 3.1 .
materials all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification .
agno3 was obtained from fisher scientific ( hong kong ) .
peg ( mw 1800 - 2200 g / mol ) was purchased from merck ( schuchardt , germany ) .
low molecular weight cts and glacial acetic acid ( hac , 99 %) were obtained from sigma chemical , st. louis , mo , usa .
all the aqueous solutions were used with double - distilled water .
3.2 .
synthesis of ag / cts / peg ncs for the synthesis of ag / cts / peg ncs , the cts solution was prepared by dissolved the cts in 1.0 wt % of hac solution and peg - 2000 solution was prepared by dissolved peg - 2000 in double - distilled water .
the 50 ml of 1.0 wt % cts solution and the 50 ml of 1.0 wt % peg - 2000 solution were mixed in the 100 ml conical flask .
the 200 mg of silver nitrate ( 0.01 m ) was added to this solution .
the solution was then carried out under nitrogen atmosphere for 15 minutes to prevent oxidation reactions during formation of ag nps .
the corresponding solution was stirred at 60 degreesc for stirring times of 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 and 48 h , respectively in a water bath to generate ag nps .
the color of the solution started to convert from pale brown to dark brown , indicating the formation of ag nps .
the reduction of agno3 into ag nps was monitored with uv - visible spectrophotometer .
finally , the obtained ag / cts / peg ncs were made into thin films for further characterization .
3.3 .
ag nps characterizations the uv - visible spectral measurements were carried out using shidmadzu uv - visible spectrophotometer ( uv - 1650pc - tokyo , japan ) from 300 nm to 700 nm. the structures of the ag / cts / peg ncs produced were studied using philips x'pert pro panalytical pw3040mpd x - ray diffraction .
transmission electron microscopy observations were carried out using hitachi h - 7100 electron microscopy ( tokyo , japan ) and the particle size distributions were determined using uthscsa image tool version 3.00 programs .
the surface morphologies of the ag / cts / peg ncs produced were observed using leo 1455 vpsem scanning electron microscopy .
the fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectra were recorded with a series 100 perkin elmer 1650 ftir spectrophotometer ( walthman , ma , usa ) over the range of 300 - 4000 cm - 1 .
4. conclusions ag nps were successfully synthesized by the green synthesis method with the use of green agents ( cts and peg ) under different stirring times of reaction at 60 degreesc .
the formation of ag nps was confirmed in the uv - vis absorption spectra , which showed the spr band characteristics of ag nps in the range of 415 - 430 nm. the xrd result confirmed that the ag nps possessed a face - centered cubic crystal structure .
in addition , this also revealed that ag nps were the main composition present in the nanocomposites without any contamination peaks .
the structures and sizes of particles were characterized using tem .
the tem images showed that the ag nps were in spherical shape and the average diameters of the particles were 5.50 , 6.45 and 19.37 nm for the stirring times of 12 , 24 and 48 h , respectively .
in order to obtain the smallest particle size of ag nps , the results showed that a stirring time of 12 h was the optimum .
on the other hand , the image of scanning electron microscopy revealed that , with the increased stirring time of reaction , larger flake surfaces presented in the ag / cts / peg ncs .
this also showed that ag / cts / peg ncs with better compatibility were produced under longer stirring times of reaction .

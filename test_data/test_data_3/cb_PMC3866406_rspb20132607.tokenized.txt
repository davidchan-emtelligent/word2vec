to assess the relative impact of functional constraint and post - mating sexual selection on sequence evolution of reproductive proteins , we examined 169 primate sperm proteins .
in order to recognize potential genome - wide trends , we additionally analysed a sample of altogether 318 non - reproductive ( brain and postsynaptic ) proteins .
based on cdnas of eight primate species ( anthropoidea ) , we observed that pre - mating sperm proteins engaged in sperm composition and assembly show significantly lower incidence of site - specific positive selection and overall lower non - synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ( dn / ds ) across sites as compared with post - mating sperm proteins involved in capacitation , hyperactivation , acrosome reaction and fertilization .
moreover , database screening revealed overall more intracellular protein interaction partners in pre - mating than in post - mating sperm proteins .
finally , post - mating sperm proteins evolved at significantly higher evolutionary rates than pre - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins on the branches to multi - male breeding species , while no such increase was observed on the branches to unimale and monogamous species .
we conclude that less protein - protein interactions of post - mating sperm proteins account for lowered functional constraint , allowing for stronger impact of post - mating sexual selection , while the opposite holds true for pre - mating sperm proteins .
this pattern is particularly strong in multi - male breeding species showing high female promiscuity .
sperm proteins brain proteins mating system sexual selection functional constraint sperm competition cover - datejanuary 22 , 2014 1 .
introduction sexual selection is well known for driving the evolution of diverse male traits in a wide range of taxa , including genital morphology in insects [ 1 ] , coloration in cichlids [ 2 ] as well as sperm mid - piece length and testis size in primates [ 3,4 ] .
at the molecular level , the size of semen coagulation proteins has been reported to covary with levels of sexual selection in hominoid primates and murine rodents ([ 5,6 ] ; see also [ 7 ]) .
other authors observed correlations between evolutionary rates of murine and primate seminal and sperm proteins with species - specific levels of sexual selection as derived from mating systems , testis sizes , number of periovulatory partners or sexual dimorphism of body weight [ 8 - 13 ] .
such associations point to post - mating competition between sperm of different males ( sperm competition ) as a force enhancing evolutionary rates of male reproductive genes and proteins .
however , other forms of post - mating sexual selection , in particular female preference of one spermatozoon over the other ( cryptic female choice ) [ 14,15 ] and conflicts arising from disproportionate costs and benefits of reproductive behaviour between sexes ( sexual conflict ) [ 16 ] , can enhance evolutionary rates of male reproductive proteins as well .
at first sight , the above examples suggest that acceleration predominates in the evolution of sperm proteins .
but against expectations , many sperm proteins are evolutionarily conserved [ 17,18 ] .
this can partly be ascribed to additional functions of ' sperm ' proteins in diverse tissues and organs without relation to reproduction .
accordingly , sperm proteins with testis - specific expression show higher rates of sequence evolution than proteins expressed in testis and other organs or proteins with exclusive expression in non - reproductive tissues [ 19,20 ] .
rates of sequence evolution may further be limited by the need to maintain basic protein functions .
in drosophila , for example , evolutionary rates of sperm proteins involved in basic functions , such as structure and metabolism , are overall lowered as compared with accessory proteins [ 17,20 ] .
still , despite an apparent effect of functional constraint on the evolution of sperm proteins , its impact has not yet been appraised using quantitative measures .
this study aims at assessing the relative impact of both functional constraint and sexual selection on evolutionary rates of functionally distinct sperm proteins .
present analyses are based on 169 human sperm proteins with increased expression in testis or prostate and a clear assignment to one of the following categories : ( i ) pre - mating sperm proteins that are engaged in sperm composition ( cytoskeleton , axoneme and outer dense fibres ) or sperm assembly ( gene regulation , spermatogenesis and sperm maturation ) and ( ii ) post - mating sperm proteins that prepare ( capacitation , hyperactivation and acrosome reaction ) or actively participate in fertilization ( zona pellucida - and egg - binding , gamete recognition , sperm - egg interaction , egg - activation and gamete fusion ) .
the expectation is that species - specific levels of sexual selection may have a stronger impact on evolutionary rates of post - mating proteins , whereas functional constraint may particularly restrict sequence evolution of pre - mating sperm proteins .
evolutionary rates of primate ( anthropoid ) sperm proteins were assessed at the cdna level using the ratio of non - synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ( dn / ds , also ka / ks or omega ) .
assuming neutral evolution of synonymous exchanges , dn / ds ratios > 1 stand for selection for more amino acid exchanges than expected under neutrality ( positive selection , adaptive evolution ) .
in turn , dn / ds values < 1 can be taken as evidence for negative selection , and hence selection against amino acid exchanges .
we quantified levels of functional constraint on the basis of direct and indirect protein interaction partners .
the impact of post - mating sexual selection was evaluated by comparing sequence evolution between primate species with higher and lower levels of female promiscuity .
potential associations between dn / ds , protein interactions and mating system variation may provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in the evolution of sperm proteins .
furthermore , they may open up new perspectives regarding genes / proteins as targets for diagnosis and treatment of impaired male fertility , development of non - hormonal contraceptives and identification of fertility markers in animal husbandry .
in order to verify whether high numbers of direct and indirect protein interactions reflect levels of functional constraint , we compiled and analysed an additional , non - reproductive dataset comprising a total of 318 brain and postsynaptic proteins .
the sample of non - reproductive proteins additionally enabled us to control for species - specific differences in demographic history that should affect entire genomes .
2. material and methods ( a ) functional categorization of sperm proteins our sample of 169 sperm proteins was based on three proteomic studies carried out by ficarro et al .
[ 21 ] , martinez - heredia et al .
[ 22 ] and parte et al .
[ 23 ] .
the first two investigations were conducted using sperm from normozoospermic men so that all proteins were taken into account .
in case of the compilation of parte et al .
[ 23 ] , we only considered proteins from normozoospermic sperm samples and ignored those identified from sperm samples of subfertile individuals .
this was done in order to focus on sperm proteins with expression in spermatozoa under physiological conditions .
as pleiotropic functions in other tissues might distort analyses addressing the impact of sexual selection on sequence evolution , we included only proteins whose high expression in testis or prostate , as compared with other tissues , had been experimentally verified .
therefore , we screened the ebi gene expression atlas ( http :// www.ebi.ac.uk / gxa /) for human microarray data and excluded all proteins without consistent information concerning their upregulation in at least one of the search items under consideration ( testis , testis germ cell , testis leydig cell , testis interstitial , testis seminiferous tubule , prostate ; state : 15 november 2012 ) .
we also excluded proteins , for which no alignment could be compiled containing the aspired species set of eight primates ( see below ) owing to missing entries , insecure annotation and / or insufficient sequence quality .
based on uniprot gene ontology annotations and original literature , we assigned each of these sperm proteins to one of the following two functional categories : - - pre - mating sperm proteins ( proteins engaged in sperm composition or sperm assembly within the male reproductive tract ; see the electronic supplementary material , table s1 ) : the 110 proteins falling into this category are constituents of structural components , such as cytoskeleton ( including cytoskeletal calyx and perinuclear theca ) , axoneme and outer dense fibres .
furthermore , these proteins participate in gene regulation , spermatogenesis or sperm maturation , finally leading to mature spermatozoa ready for ejaculation .
the included motor proteins of the dynein complex are involved in the bending of the sperm tail .
- - post - mating sperm proteins ( proteins preparing or actively participating in fertilization ; see the electronic supplementary material , table s2 ) : the 59 proteins of this category are either involved in post - mating processes increasing sperm motility and priming spermatozoa for sperm - egg interaction ( capacitation , hyperactivation and acrosome reaction ) or contribute immediately to gamete recognition , sperm - egg interaction , egg - activation and gamete fusion via interaction with female molecules .
( b ) analyses of sequence evolution for each of the 169 sperm proteins , we generated a codon - based alignment using the muscle algorithm implemented in the guidance web - server [ 24 ] .
alignments were purified from problematic codon positions using guidance , leaving only columns with scores higher than 0.93 ( default threshold ) .
guidance alignments were quality checked per eye and newly generated on the basis of manually edited raw alignments when needed .
to standardize analyses , we compiled datasets including sequence orthologues of human ( homo sapiens , hsa ) , common chimpanzee ( pan troglodytes , ptr ) , western lowland gorilla ( gorilla gorilla , ggo ) , sumatran orang - utan ( pongo abelii , pab ) , northern white - cheeked gibbon ( nomascus leucogenys , nle ) , rhesus monkey ( macaca mulatta , mmu ) , olive baboon ( papio anubis , pan ) and white - tufted - ear marmoset ( callithrix jacchus , cja ) .
coding dnas were retrieved from ensembl and ncbi databases ( for accession numbers , see the electronic supplementary material , tables s3 and s4 ) .
subsequent analyses of sequence evolution were conducted in the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) framework implemented in the paml v .
4.4 ( phylogenetic analyses by ml ) package [ 25 ] .
the loaded tree represented a basal trifurcation giving rise to plathyrrhini ( new world monkeys ) , cercopithecoidea ( old world monkeys ) and hominoidea ( apes including humans ) : ( cja ,( mmu,pan ),( nle ,( pab ,( ggo ,( ptr,hsa ))))) .
we specified the f3 x 4 model of codon frequencies and removed sites with ambiguous data ( cleandata = 1 ) .
( i ) codon - specific analyses each of the 169 alignments was tested for the presence of positively selected codon sites employing a likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) that compares the fit of two beta model versions implemented in codeml [ 26 ] .
both model versions assume a beta distribution of codon sites in the dn / ds interval ( 0,1 ) .
however , while the alternative version ( m8 ) allows for an extra site class under positive selection ( dn / ds >= 1 ) , dn / ds of this extra site class is fixed at 1 in the null version ( m8a ) .
to ensure convergence at global optima , m8 analyses were run thrice with different initial dn / ds values ( 0.6 , 1.2 and 1.6 ) .
for lrt , 2deltal was compared with critical values following a 50 : 50 mixture of a point mass at zero and a chi2 distribution with degrees of freedom ( d.f. ) equal to the difference in the number of free parameters between m8a and m8 (= 1 ) .
to reduce the number of false positives , we applied a 1 % level of significance ( critical value = 5.41 ) ( see the electronic supplementary material , tables s5 and s6 ) .
subsequently , we analysed if the distribution of proteins with / without candidate sites of positive selection differed between pre - and post - mating sperm proteins using the chi2 - test .
additionally , levels of dn / ds across sites ( m8a ) were compared between both groups by employing mann - whitney u - test ( two sided ) .
all tests were conducted with spss v .
20.0 applying a 5 % level of significance and sequential bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons .
we computed 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) for each proportion and median on the basis of 100 000 bootstrap replicates using in - house perl scripts .
( ii ) assessing the impact of sexual selection effects of post - mating sexual selection on sequence evolution of pre - mating and post - mating sperm proteins were investigated across protein groups considering variant mating systems in the sampled species ( see electronic supplementary material , tables s7 and s8 ; for a compilation of mating systems , see e.g. [ 27 ]) .
in order to recognize potential genome - wide trends , we additionally analysed a sample of 318 non - reproductive proteins ( see below ; see also the electronic supplementary material , tables s9 and s10 ) .
in the first approach , we ran the free - ratio model ( codeml ) , which allows dn / ds to vary across branches , on each of the cdna alignments and compared the estimates for terminal branches to northern white - cheeked gibbon and common chimpanzee .
these two species were chosen because they represent the two extremes in the range of mating systems covered by our sample : while common chimpanzees are multi - male breeders with an extraordinarily high number of periovulatory mating partners , northern white - cheeked gibbons are monogamous and extra - pair matings have not been reported ([ 27,28 ] ; for a compilation of species - specific numbers of periovulatory partners , see [ 9 ]) .
we additionally ran a branch model that inferred dn / ds values for the terminal branches representing species samples with lower ( foreground 1 : monogamous gibbon , monogamous human and unimale western lowland gorilla ) and higher levels of post - mating sexual selection ( foreground 2 : chimpanzee and rhesus monkey ) .
the branches representing white - tufted - ear marmoset and sumatran orang - utan were sampled into the background instead of foreground 1 owing to frequent extra - pair and - group matings in both species that impair predictions regarding levels of post - mating sexual selection [ 29 - 32 ] .
furthermore , the branch to olive baboon was regarded as a background branch owing to frequent mating of this nominally multi - male breeding species with unimale breeding hamadryas baboon , papio hamadryas [ 33,34 ] .
subsequently , we tested gibbon branch , chimpanzee branch , foreground 1 and foreground 2 for different distributions of dn / ds estimates across pre - mating sperm , post - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins using kruskal - wallis rank - sum test ( 2 d.f. , two sided ) .
if kruskal - wallis test rejected equality of distribution , we conducted post hoc mann - whitney u - test on pairs of protein groups ( two sided ) .
kruskal - wallis and mann - whitney u - tests were conducted with spss v .
20.0 applying a 5 % level of significance and sequential bonferroni correction .
ninety - five per cent cis of medians were inferred using an in - house perl script .
whenever short branches impaired the inference of dn / ds estimates for at least one of the terminal branches or foregrounds compared , a protein was excluded from downstream analyses .
this procedure led to inclusion of 29 pre - mating sperm , 25 post - mating sperm and 102 non - reproductive proteins when focusing on the branches to common chimpanzee and northern white - cheeked gibbon ( see the electronic supplementary material , tables s7 , s8 and s10 ) .
comparisons of foregrounds 1 and 2 were based on 44 pre - mating sperm , 43 post - mating sperm and 177 non - reproductive proteins ( see the electronic supplementary material , tables s7 , s8 and s10 ) .
( c ) numbers of protein - protein interactions as a proxy of functional constraint we assessed levels of functional constraint for each of the 169 sperm proteins based on numbers of direct and indirect protein - protein interaction partners ( pip ) as taken from 17 out of 25 databases available through psicquic ( proteomics standard initiative common query interface ; state 27 may 2013 ) , using human protein ids as search items ( see the electronic supplementary material , tables s1 and s2 ) and employing the psicquic clustering feature that provides a non - redundant list of interactants .
the genemania , irefindex , interoporc and string databases were opted out in order to avoid that assumed ( instead of proven ) interactions biased our results .
for the same reason , we ignored search results with the attributes ' unspecified method ' , ' predictive text mining ' and / or ' inferred by curator ' ( quotation marks highlight psicquic terminology ) .
moreover , results without information about the underlying methodology or referring to interactions between human proteins and proteins of other species including pathogens were excluded .
therefore , we also ignored hits from the mpidb and virhostnet databases , which focus on interactions with microbes and viruses .
additionally , we avoided to record interactions between proteins and drug - like molecules , and thus excluded the bindingdb and chembl databases .
in the electronic supplementary material , tables s5 and s6 , we list numbers of interactions per sampled pre - mating and post - mating sperm protein .
we checked for a correlation between the number of direct and indirect protein interaction partners per protein ( npip ) and dn / ds across sites ( m8a ) , employing spearman 's rank correlation .
additionally , we investigated whether levels of dn / ds across sites ( m8a ) differed between 71 sperm proteins with npip < 10 and 16 sperm proteins with npip > 100 using mann - whitney u - test .
finally , we examined whether levels of npip differed between pre - and post - mating sperm proteins , employing mann - whitney u - test again .
ninety - five per cent cis of medians ( dn / ds , npip ) were inferred from 100 000 bootstrap replicates , each .
all analyses were carried out with spss v .
20.0 applying a 5 % level of significance and sequential bonferroni correction for multiple testing .
an analogous procedure was applied to a set of 318 non - reproductive proteins ( see below ) , thereof 136 with npip < 10 and 29 with npip > 100 ( see the electronic supplementary material , tables s5 , s6 and s10 ) .
( d ) sample of non - reproductive proteins in order to ( i ) recognize potential effects of demography on sequence evolution of sperm proteins and ( ii ) validate a potential relationship between npip and sequence evolution , we compiled a sample of non - reproductive proteins , adopting a previous approach [ 35 ] .
this sample contained 318 human brain and postsynaptic density proteins from proteomic studies of dumont et al .
[ 36 ] and bayes et al .
[ 37 ] that showed no upregulation in testis or prostate according to ebi gene expression atlas ( search items as described for sperm proteins ; state 27 november 2012 ) .
the complete set of eight orthologous cdnas was available for each of the sampled non - reproductive proteins .
accession numbers of cdnas and data on sequence analyses and npip are reported in the electronic supplementary material , tables s9 and s10 .
3. results ( a ) differential proportions of site - specific positive selection and levels of dn / ds across codon sites in functionally distinct sperm proteins at the 1 % level of significance , lrt statistics supported the presence of positively selected codon sites for 33 out of 169 cdna alignments ( see the electronic supplementary material , tables s5 and s6 ) , each representing a constant set of eight primate ( anthropoid ) species .
the proportion of alignments including candidate sites of positive selection was markedly higher in post - mating sperm proteins preparing or actively participating in fertilization ( 36 %) than in pre - mating sperm proteins engaged in sperm composition or sperm assembly ( 11 %) ( figure 1a ; electronic supplementary material , table s11 ) .
additionally , median dn / ds values ( m8a ) pointed to overall enhanced non - synonymous / synonymous substitution rate ratios of post - mating proteins (= 0.233 ) versus pre - mating sperm proteins (= 0.077 ) ( figure 1b ) .
in line with this , chi2 and mann - whitney u - tests provided highly significant support for increased incidence of site - specific positive selection and overall higher dn / ds values ( m8a ) in post - mating relative to pre - mating sperm proteins ( p < 0.01 , each ; electronic supplementary material , table s11 ) .

( a ) group - specific proportions illustrate significantly higher incidence of positively selected codon sites in sperm proteins preparing or actively participating in fertilization ( post - mating sperm proteins ) than in sperm proteins adopting functions within the male reproductive tract ( pre - mating sperm proteins ) .
the presence of positively selected codon sites was assessed at the 1 % level of significance applying a lrt ( codeml m8a / m8 ) .
( b ) levels of dn / ds estimates ( medians , m8a ) are significantly increased in post - mating sperm proteins relative to pre - mating sperm proteins across the sampled primate orthologues .
vertical bars define 95 % cis calculated from 100 000 bootstrap replicates .
double asterisks (**) highlight support from ( a ) chi2 and ( b ) mann - whitney u - test at the 1 % level of significance after sequential bonferroni correction .
see the electronic supplementary material , table s11 .
( b ) branch - specific dn / ds values against the background of protein - function and mating system variation kruskal - wallis test rejected equal distribution of dn / ds estimates across pre - and post - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins for the branch to multi - male breeding common chimpanzee ( p < 0.05 ) , but not for the branch to monogamous northern white - cheeked gibbon ( p > 0.05 ; electronic supplementary material , table s12 ) .
indeed , 95 % cis of median dn / ds estimates were highly overlapping with respect to the gibbon branch .
on the contrary , 95 % ci of post - mating sperm proteins ranged above the respective intervals of pre - mating and non - reproductive proteins with regard to the chimpanzee branch ( figure 2a ) .
as far as the chimpanzee branch was concerned , levels of dn / ds estimates were more than twofold higher in post - mating sperm proteins ( median dn / ds = 0.428 ) than in pre - mating sperm ( median dn / ds = 0.190 ) and non - reproductive proteins ( median dn / ds = 0.211 ) ( figure 2a ; electronic supplementary material , table s12 ) .
accordingly , post hoc analyses of the chimpanzee branch provided significant support for different dn / ds levels in post - mating sperm relative to pre - mating sperm proteins ( p < 0.05 ) and non - reproductive proteins ( p < 0.01 ; mann - whitney u - test , each ) .
however , no such support was provided when comparing dn / ds estimates of pre - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins for the chimpanzee branch ( p > 0.05 ; mann - whitney u - test ; electronic supplementary material , tables s7 , s8 , s10 and s13 ) .

sequence evolution of pre - mating sperm ( pre ) , post - mating sperm ( post ) and non - reproductive proteins ( non ) against the background of variant mating systems in primates .
kruskal - wallis test supported differential levels of dn / ds across the three distinguished protein classes exclusively for the terminal branches to multi - male breeding species ( right panels in ( a ) and ( b )) , but not for the terminal branches representing species with less intense post - mating sexual selection ( left panels ) .
post hoc mann - whitney u - test provided significant support for increased levels of dn / ds values in post - mating sperm versus pre - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins for the branches to species with higher sperm competition levels ( right panels ) .
the described patterns were reproduced , irrespective of ( a ) confining analyses to monogamous northern white - cheeked gibbon ( gibbon ) and multi - male breeding common chimpanzee ( chimpanzee ) or ( b ) taking into account species samples representing lower ( northern white - cheeked gibbon , human and western lowland gorilla ; lower ) and higher levels of female promiscuity ( common chimpanzee and rhesus monkey ; higher ) .
columns and vertical bars define medians and 95 % cis derived from 100 000 bootstrap replicates .
double (**) and single asterisks (*) highlight support from post hoc mann - whitney u - test at the 1 % and 5 % level of significance , respectively , after sequential bonferroni correction .
see the electronic supplementary material , tables s12 and s13 .
these findings could be reproduced when expanding analyses from chimpanzee and gibbon to our species samples representing higher and lower levels of post - mating sexual selection .
thus , test results suggested unequal evolutionary rates of the three distinguished protein classes for the terminal branches to multi - male breeding chimpanzee and rhesus monkey ( p < 0.05 ) , but not for the branches to monogamous gibbon and human and unimale breeding gorilla ( p > 0.05 ; kruskal - wallis test , each ; electronic supplementary material , table s12 ) .
moreover , mann - whitney u - test confirmed significantly higher dn / ds estimates for post - mating sperm proteins ( median dn / ds = 0.339 ) as compared with pre - mating sperm proteins ( median dn / ds = 0.233 ; p < 0.05 ) and non - reproductive proteins ( median dn / ds = 0.259 ; p < 0.05 ) for the branches to chimpanzee and rhesus monkey .
however , focusing on the same branches , mann - whitney u - test did not support different levels of dn / ds in pre - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins ( p > 0.05 ; figure 2b ; electronic supplementary material , table s13 ) .
the chosen approach of comparing sequence evolution of functionally distinguished proteins within taxa made our results robust with respect to demographic effects .
hence , overall increased dn / ds values in post - mating sperm proteins on the branches to multi - male breeders cannot be explained by demographic effects , such as population bottlenecks .
in addition , 95 % cis of median dn / ds values illustrated actually very similar evolutionary rates of pre - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins on the branches to multi - male breeders and species with less intense post - mating sexual selection ( figure 2 ; electronic supplementary material , table s12 ) .
this additionally argues against a general acceleration of sequence evolution on the branches representing multi - male breeders .
thus , increased levels of dn / ds in post - mating sperm proteins on the branches to multi - male breeders most probably reflect that post - mating sexual selection is more effective in these species .
( c ) inverse relationship between dn / ds across codon sites and numbers of protein interaction partners spearman 's correlation indicated with high significance that dn / ds values across sites ( m8a ) and npip per human orthologue were negatively correlated in non - reproductive proteins ( rs = - 0.176 ; p < 0.01 ) .
in our sample of sperm proteins , the negative correlation was even more pronounced ( rs = - 0.452 ; p < 0.01 ; electronic supplementary material , figures s1 and s2 ) .
in line with this general trend , levels of dn / ds across sites ( m8a ) were consistently higher in sperm and non - reproductive proteins with npip < 10 ( median dn / ds = 0.213 and 0.149 , respectively ) than in their counterparts having npip > 100 ( median dn / ds = 0.027 and 0.101 , respectively ; p < 0.01 , each ; mann - whitney u - test ; figure 3a ; electronic supplementary material , tables s5 , s6 , s10 and s14 ) .
thus , overall higher numbers of protein interactants in pre - mating ( median npip = 22 ) than in post - mating sperm proteins ( median npip = 6 ; p < 0.01 ; mann - whitney u - test ) probably reflect increased levels of functional constraint in the former relative to the latter group ( figure 3b ; electronic supplementary material , table s14 ) .
taken together , our data suggest that post - mating sperm proteins are less functionally constrained and more subjected to some form of post - mating sexual selection than are pre - mating sperm proteins .
this pattern is more obvious in multi - male breeding species than in monogamous and unimale breeding species .
figure 3 .
sequence evolution and numbers of protein - protein interaction partners .
( a ) levels of dn / ds are significantly higher in proteins with less than 10 protein - protein interaction partners ( npip < 10 ) than in proteins having more than 100 protein - protein interaction partners ( npip > 100 ) , irrespective whether taking sperm or non - reproductive proteins .
medians correspond to m8a estimates as inferred from eight primate orthologues per gene .
( b ) pre - mating sperm proteins have significantly more protein - protein interaction partners than post - mating sperm proteins .
numbers of interacting proteins were derived from 17 databanks using the psicquic meta - server .
vertical bars refer to 95 % cis inferred from 100 000 bootstrap replicates .
double asterisks (**) stand for significance at the 1 % level ( mann - whitney u - test ) after sequential bonferroni correction .
see the electronic supplementary material , table s14 and figures s1 and s2 .
4. discussion ( a ) higher incidence of positive selection and elevated levels of dn / ds across sites in post - versus pre - mating sperm proteins of primates proteins with germline - specific expression have repeatedly been described to evolve at higher evolutionary rates than proteins with expression maxima in other tissues [ 15,16,35 ] .
this applies particularly to sperm proteins , such as sea urchin bindin [ 38 ] , gastropod lysin [ 39 ] and members of our present sample , such as acrosin ( acr ) and sperm autoantigenic protein 17 ( spa17 ) [ 26,40 ] .
on the other hand , not all sperm proteins evolve rapidly and evolutionary rates actually depend on their detailed function [ 7,17,26 ] .
our observation of higher incidence of site - specific positive selection and overall increased dn / ds values across sites in post - mating versus pre - mating sperm proteins confirms a general association between protein function and evolutionary rate ( figure 1 ; see also the electronic supplementary material , tables s5 and s6 ) .
hence , our data provide an additional example for an adaptive compartmentalization across the different steps of fertilization and , in particular , for an acceleration of sequence evolution towards sperm proteins involved in post - mating functions [ 7,17,18,41,42 ] .
( b ) numbers of protein - protein interactants suggest higher functional constraint in pre - versus post - mating sperm proteins protein - protein interactions mediate diverse intra - and intercellular processes and are pivotal for the functionality of cells and organisms .
as impaired functioning of one protein affects all or at least some of its direct and indirect interactions , proteins having more interactants are more likely crucial for cell functioning than proteins with less interactants ([ 43 ] ; see also [ 44,45 ]) .
such increase in essentiality lowers non - synonymous substitution rates of proteins involved in more interactions : first , many initial amino acid exchanges require compensatory exchanges in binding partners to maintain pre - existing interactions [ 46 ] .
yet , each compensatory exchange is unlikely to occur within a tolerable time frame and , as a consequence , the domains mediating protein - protein interactions are usually highly conserved [ 47 ] .
second , interacting domains form larger portions of proteins having many than of those having few interactants [ 48 ] .
this leads to stronger evolutionary conservation of total proteins with increasing numbers of interaction partners .
in line with this , proteins at the centre of interaction networks have been shown to evolve at lower rates than peripheral proteins in a broad range of taxa [ 48 - 50 ] .
such negative association between numbers of interaction partners and substitution rates is exactly what we observed in our analyses of sperm and non - reproductive proteins .
especially , spearman 's rank correlation demonstrated that a protein evolves at lower rates the more interactions it is engaged in ( see electronic supplementary material , figures s1 and s2 ) .
contrasting proteins with few and many interacting partners ( npip < 10 versus npip > 100 ) made the negative association between numbers of interactants and evolutionary rates even more obvious in our sperm and non - reproductive protein samples ( figure 3a ) .
we are aware that the currently reported numbers of protein interactants are preliminary and that conclusions should be drawn with care .
on the other hand , theoretical considerations suggest that the more protein interactants are known for a certain protein , the more additional interaction partners will be identified in the future [ 51 ] .
moreover , it is important to note that the present screen of npip data focused on protein - protein interactions within the male reproductive tract , and in particular on interactions within spermatozoa .
thus , lower numbers of protein interaction partners in post - mating sperm proteins ( figure 3b ) most likely reflect their peripheral role in the sperm interactome and not a bias from potentially less comprehensive data on postcopulatory interactions between male and female proteins .
consequently , we ascribe less incidence of site - specific positive selection and lower dn / ds values across sites ( m8a ) in pre - mating versus post - mating sperm proteins to overall higher numbers of intracellular interactants in the former relative to the latter group ( compare [ 52 ]) .
( c ) branch - specific dn / ds values suggest most effective post - mating sexual selection in post - mating sperm proteins while functional constraint generally counteracts non - synonymous substitutions , post - mating sexual selection is known to have an accelerating effect on sequence evolution of sperm proteins ( e.g. [ 8 - 13 ] ; see also [ 35,53 ]) .
consistently , we observed significantly increased dn / ds values in post - mating relative to pre - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins for the branch to common chimpanzee and for foreground 2 comprising chimpanzee and rhesus branches .
on the contrary , post - mating sperm , pre - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins evolved at similar rates on the gibbon branch and across foreground 1 which merges gibbon , human and gorilla branches ( figure 2 ; electronic supplementary material , tables s12 and s13 ; for mating systems , see e.g. [ 27,28 ]) .
as outlined in the results section , the statistical approach itself as well as similar dn / ds estimates for pre - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins for branches representing different matings systems makes it improbable that genome - wide effects biased our results .
rather , our data imply that some form of post - mating sexual selection , possibly sperm competition , accelerates sequence evolution of post - mating sperm proteins and that this phenomenon is more pronounced in species with increased female promiscuity .
although these findings were reproduced in a two - species approach ( gibbon versus chimpanzee ) and in a multi - species approach ( foreground 1 versus foreground 2 ) , the increase of evolutionary rates of post - mating sperm proteins appeared not as strong in the combined analysis of chimpanzee and rhesus branches as in the isolated analysis of the chimpanzee branch ( see right panels in figure 2 ; electronic supplementary material , table s12 ) .
this might be partly owing to different samples of post - mating sperm proteins covered by both approaches ( n = 25 and 43 , respectively ) .
the models employed ( free - ratio model and branch model ) might also have had an impact on the respective dn / ds estimates .
however , the most probable explanation for this observation is that levels of post - mating sexual selection are lower in rhesus monkey ( about three male periovulatory partners ) than common chimpanzee ( about eight male periovulatory partners ; see [ 9 ]) despite a nominally identical mating system .
consequently , the inclusion of the rhesus branch might have lowered dn / ds estimates for post - mating sperm proteins .
it is further noteworthy that post - mating sperm proteins might also evolve at slightly increased evolutionary rates in northern white - cheeked gibbon , western lowland gorilla and human ( see medians in figure 2 , left panels ) .
as loss - of - function mutations were not observed throughout the sampled cdnas , neutrally evolving pseudogenes cannot explain this observation .
relaxed functional constraint , owing to strict monogamy as in pupal - mating butterflies [ 54 ] , is also unlikely to explain the pattern .
the finding might rather reflect occasional extra - pair and - group matings of females even in primate species with overall lower levels of post - mating sexual selection , as they frequently occur in white - tufted - ear marmoset and sumatran orang - utan [ 29 - 32 ] .
still , the enhancement of evolutionary rates of post - mating sperm proteins was not significant in comparison with pre - mating sperm and non - reproductive proteins on the branches representing species with lower levels of post - mating sexual selection ( figure 2 ) .
5. conclusion our data suggest that less functional constraint and more effective post - mating sexual selection explain overall increased non - synonymous / synonymous substitution rate ratios in post - mating relative to pre - mating sperm proteins .
present analyses further illustrate that the accelerating effect of post - mating sexual selection on sequence evolution is particularly effective on post - mating sperm proteins .
but despite an apparent effect of functional constraint and post - mating sexual selection , other factors might affect sequence evolution of sperm proteins too .
in particular , immune evasion , which describes the evolutionary escape of male reproductive proteins from female immune system , functional redundancy and defence against transposable elements through the pirna pathway [ 55 - 57 ] may accelerate sequence evolution of sperm proteins .
expanding the focus on accelerating forces effective in female germline , other factors could be named , for example meiotic drive , which enhances sequence evolution of centromere and kinetochore proteins via competition for microtubule attachments in female meiosis [ 58 ] .
irrespectively of the latter , our data allow for some conclusions regarding the suitability of pre - and post - mating sperm proteins for applications in reproductive medicine and husbandry .
considering that higher numbers of interaction partners imply a central position in biological networks , and hence higher essentiality for their maintenance [ 59 ] and for cell functioning [ 43 ] , pre - mating sperm proteins can be regarded as prime candidates for diagnosis and treatment of impaired male fertility .
they may further be promising targets for the development of non - hormonal contraceptives , as illustrated by successful immunogenization against structural sperm proteins , for example sperm flagellar protein 2 ( sfp2 ) [ 60 ] .
although selected post - mating sperm proteins may also be suitable targets for treatment of male infertility and non - hormonal contraception [ 61 ] , strongest signatures of sexual selection suggest members of this category as the most promising targets for the identification of new biomarkers for male fertility levels in animal husbandry .

introduction prolonged length of stay ( plos ) following ischemic stroke inflates cost , increases risk for hospital - acquired complications , and has been associated with worse prognosis .
methods acute ischemic stroke patients admitted between july 2008 and december 2010 were retrospectively analyzed for plos , defined as a patient stable for discharge hospitalized for an additional >= 24 hours .
results of 274 patients included , 106 ( 38.7 %) had plos ( median age 65 years , 60.6 % female , 69.0 % black ) .
patients with plos had higher admission nihss than patients without plos ( 9 versus 5 , p = 0.0010 ) .
a larger proportion of patients with plos developed an infection ( p < 0.0001 ) , and after adjusting for covariates , these patients had greater odds of poor short - term functional outcome ( or = 2.25 , 95 % ci 1.17 - 4.32 , p = 0.0148 ) .
adjusting for infection , the odds of patients with plos having poor short - term functional outcome were no longer significant ( or = 1.68 , 95 % ci 0.83 - 3.35 , p = 0.1443 ) .
conclusions the contraction of a hospital - acquired infection was a significant predictor of plos and a contributor of poor short - term outcome following an ischemic stroke. whether the cause or the consequence of plos , hospital - acquired infections are largely preventable and a target for reducing length of stay .
national center on minority health and health disparities : nimhdp60 md000502 || md 1 .
introduction typical management of acute stroke has a variable duration , lasting from 5 to 14 days on average [ 1 , 2 ] .
longer stays are more common in older patients [ 2 - 4 ] and those with more severe strokes [ 1 ] , anterior circulation infarcts [ 2 , 4 ] , atrial fibrillation [ 1 , 4 ] , and hemorrhagic - type strokes [ 1 , 2 ] .
longer stays also correlate with worse functional outcome and unfavorable discharge disposition in patients with acute ischemic stroke ( ais ) [ 4 , 5 ] .
koton et al. demonstrated a valid scoring tool to identify patients with stroke at risk for a hospitalization of >= 7 days at triage [ 1 , 6 ] .
unfortunately , this tool was designed to predict prolonged hospitalization using common data elements collected at triage , failing to take into account complications that may occur during the inpatient stay .
second , studies that have described in - hospital associations with plos defined length of stay by an absolute threshold , with some using a threshold of about 30 days [ 4 , 7 ] .
these studies do not compare differences between patients with and without plos .
more importantly , they do not include patients with plos with a hospital course of < 30 days - - which represents the majority of stroke patients at u.s. centers [ 8 ] .
in this study , we define plos without a threshold to better demonstrate its associations .
we aim to identify in - hospital risk factors for plos and identify the driving force ( s ) for its association with poor functional outcome among patients with ais [ 4 ] .
uncovering the underlying in - hospital risk factors and etiologies for plos may allow medical centers to develop better interventions to reduce plos .
2. methods we conducted a single - center retrospective analysis of patient information collected in a prospective stroke registry between july 2008 and december 2010 [ 9 ] .
patients were included unless they arrived > 48 hours after time last seen normal , had an unknown last seen normal , experienced an in - hospital stroke , or did not have plos data documented .
plos was defined as an extension in hospitalization for >= 24 hours more than would be necessary to stabilize the patient for discharge , as determined by the review of progress notes .
our definition depends on the patient 's neurologic stability for discharge rather than the completion of a stroke work - up for two reasons : ( 1 ) aspects of the stroke work - up may not be appropriate in acute management , and ( 2 ) the work - up itself may be a cause for plos .
determination of plos and the reasons for plos were documented prior to development of the aims of the present study using a case report form with three questions : ( 1 ) was hospitalization prolonged due to complication ?
( 2 ) was hospitalization prolonged due to imaging or procedure ? and ( 3 ) was hospitalization prolonged due to securing disposition ?
further chart audit by trained personnel , including a vascular neurologist , determined the specific cause of plos .
we investigated admission , in - hospital , and outcome data elements associated with plos .
causes of plos were grouped into the following categories : neurologic complications , nonneurologic medical complications ( including hospital - acquired infections [ hai ]) , delay due to imaging , delay due to procedure ( s ) , and delay in disposition arrangement .
hai was distinguished from infection on admission via white blood cell count , clinical symptoms , and / or a positive culture for bacterium other than common contaminant .
these categories were compared on admission , in - hospital , and functional outcome data elements .
we assessed the following outcome variables in our population : neurologic deterioration ( defined as an increase in the national institutes of health stroke scale [ nihss ] by 2 or more points in a 24 - hour period during hospital stay ) [ 10 ] , discharge nihss score , discharge modified rankin scale ( mrs ) score [ 11 , 12 ] , poor functional outcome at discharge ( mrs > 2 ) , unfavorable discharge disposition ( discharge to a facility other than inpatient rehabilitation or home ) , and in - hospital mortality .
categorical data were compared using pearson 's chi - square test or fisher 's exact test where appropriate .
continuous data ( presented as mean / standard deviation for normally distributed data or median ( range ) for nonnormally distributed data ) were compared using t - test for normally distributed data or wilcoxon rank sum for nonnormally distributed data .
associations between exposures of interest and outcome measures were assessed using crude and adjusted logistic regression models .
as this was an exploratory analysis , no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons [ 13 ] .
all tests were performed at the alpha = 0.05 level .
3. results 3.1 .
demographics of the 274 patients included ( median age 65 years , 60.6 % female , 69.0 % black ) , 106 ( 38.7 %) had plos .
the mean duration of hospitalization for patients without plos was 4 days compared to 9 days for patients with plos ( p < 0.0001 ). of baseline demographic measures , only baseline nihss differed significantly , with plos patients having a higher median score ( 9 versus 5 , p = 0.0010 ) .
there were no significant differences in stroke etiology or infarct vascular distribution between patients with plos versus those without plos ( table 1 ) .
3.2 .
in - hospital risk factors thirty - six ( 34.9 %) patients with plos had prolonged hospitalizations due to nonneurologic medical complications ( e.g. , acute kidney injury , acute respiratory distress syndrome , myocardial infarction ) .
fifteen ( 14.2 %) patients with plos had extended hospitalizations due to hai .
compared to all other patients in our population , patients with hai were significantly older ( median age 74 versus 64 , p = 0.0036 ). of patients with hai , patients with plos were older ( median age 81 versus 73 , p = 0.0447 ) but had no other significant differences at baseline .
among medical complications that prolong hospitalization , 3 of our patients with plos ( 2.8 %) had extended stays due to pulmonary embolism , and 1 patient ( 0.9 %) had an extended stay due to a deep vein thrombosis , despite routine venous thrombosis prophylaxis .
3.3 .
plos , poor outcomes , and hospital - acquired infection while patients with plos did not have higher proportions of in - hospital mortality ( table 2 ) , patients with plos were at greater odds of neurologic deterioration compared to patients without plos ( unadjusted or = 3.172 , 95 % ci 1.88 - 5.37 , p < 0.0001 ) .
in terms of discharge measures , plos was significantly associated with poor short - term functional outcome ( crude or = 3.00 , 95 % ci 1.77 - 5.09 , p < 0.0001 ) , higher discharge nihss ( median nihss 6 versus 2 , p < 0.0001 ) , and unfavorable discharge disposition ( crude or = 3.16 , 95 % ci 1.48 - 6.77 , p = 0.0030 ) .
after adjusting for baseline nihss , age , and admission serum glucose , plos remained an independent predictor of poor short - term functional outcome ( adjusted or = 2.25 , 95 % ci 1.17 - 4.32 , p = 0.0148 ) but not significantly associated with unfavorable discharge disposition ( adjusted or = 2.27 , 95 % ci 0.93 - 5.52 , p = 0.0707 ) .
once infection was added to the model , plos was no longer an independent predictor of short - term poor functional outcome ( adjusted or = 1.68 , 95 % ci 0.83 - 3.35 , p = 0.1443 ) or unfavorable discharge disposition ( adjusted or = 1.60 , 95 % ci 0.60 - 4.25 , p = 0.3444 ) .
urinary tract infection ( uti ) and pneumonia accounted for over 80 % of hai incidence .
further , patients with the combination of plos and hai were at greater odds of discharge nihss being greater than baseline nihss ( crude or = 5.58 , 95 % ci 2.34 - 13.28 , p = 0.0001 ) , discharge nihss > 14 ( crude or = 8.27 , 95 % ci 3.21 - 21.27 , p < 0.0001 ) , poor short - term functional outcome ( crude or = 11.98 , 95 % ci 3.33 - 43.1 , p = 0.0001 ) , and unfavorable discharge disposition ( crude or = 6.04 , 95 % ci 1.99 - 18.28 , p = 0.0015 ) when compared to patients with plos who did not develop a hai .
alternatively , among patients with hai , plos was not significantly associated with short - term poor functional outcome ( or = 2.87 , 95 % ci 0.53 - 15.7 , p = 0.2229 ) or unfavorable discharge disposition ( or = 1.63 , 95 % ci 0.44 - 5.98 , p = 0.4619 ) when compared to patients with hai who did not have plos .
4. discussion in our study , nearly half of the patients with ischemic stroke were hospitalized for >= 24 hours more than necessary to stabilize them for discharge , with medical complications being the most contributory in - hospital cause .
patients with plos had significantly worse outcomes in nearly every measure. of nonmodifiable risk factors , patients with plos had more severe neurologic dysfunction at baseline and were older than patients who did not experience plos , in keeping with previous reports [ 1 , 3 - 5 , 14 ]. of modifiable risk factors , nonneurologic medical complications had the strongest association with plos .
in particular , hai significantly contributed to plos .
in fact , the association between plos and short - term poor functional outcome ( with adjustments for known predictors of poor outcome and mortality ) was no longer statistically significant once adjusting for infection .
despite different approaches , our findings closely aligned with a previous study relating symptomatic utis in acute stroke to unfavorable discharge disposition [ 15 ] .
taken together , these results indicate that plos is not independently associated with poor functional outcome after stroke , but that hai may be the driving force for poor functional outcome in these patients who have prolonged hospital stays .
further studies are needed to establish if there is a linear relationship with infections leading to plos and then leading to poor functional outcome or if it is plos leading to infection which then leads to poor functional outcome .
in our study , uti and pneumonia were the most frequent etiologies of hai and accounted for the majority of infection incidences .
these results support diligent monitoring of patients at risk for hai ; namely patients requiring intubation [ 16 ] , catheterization [ 17 ] , peripherial venous access [ 18 ] , patients with more severe stroke [ 19 ] , dysphagia [ 19 , 20 ] , and the elderly [ 20 ] .
taking appropriate measures to prevent infection ( e.g. , exchanging and / or removing unnecessary catheters [ 21 ]) could significantly curb plos and its complications .
our study is not without limitations .
the retrospective nature of our study limits the ability to determine causal relationships .
further , our small sample size may limit our ability to detect existing differences between groups .
among patients with plos due to infection ( n = 14 ) , we can safely argue that the infection prolonged hospitalization for these patients due to the methodology implemented in our data abstraction process .
however , we cannot make the same statement for the rest of the patients with plos prior to infection .
infection in these patients may or may not have caused a secondary plos .
regardless , our data indicates that infection and plos are compounding variables that contribute to poor short - term outcome in ais patients .
despite its limitations , our study is unique in that we did not use an absolute threshold for plos ( in days ) as in prior studies on neurologic diseases [ 1 , 4 , 7 , 22 ] .
our definition was tailored to the specific management of the patient , as some investigators have shown that an absolute threshold of plos following stroke may not be applicable to all patients at all centers [ 23 ] .
in summary , our findings confirm the association between plos and poor short - term functional outcome [ 4 , 14 , 24 ] .
unlike other studies , which we attempted to parse the association between hai and plos to indicate hai , especially uti and pneumonia , was a major modifiable risk factor driving poor functional outcome in patients with plos .

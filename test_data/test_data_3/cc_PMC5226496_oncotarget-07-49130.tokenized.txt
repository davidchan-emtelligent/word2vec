the wnt / beta - catenin signaling is crucial for the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells .
however , the expression of microrna - 224 ( mir - 224 ) in the different types of breast cancers and its role in the wnt / beta - catenin signaling and the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells are poorly understood .
in this study , the levels of mir - 224 in different types of breast cancer tissues and cell lines were examined by quantitative rt - pcr and the potential targets of mir - 224 in the wnt / beta - catenin signaling were investigated .
the effects of altered mir - 224 expression on the frequency of cd44 + cd24 - cancer stem - like cells ( csc ) , proliferation and migration of mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were examined by flow cytometry , mtt and transwell migration .
we found that the levels of mir - 224 expression in different types of breast cancer tissues and cell lines were associated inversely with aggressiveness of breast cancers .
enhanced mir - 224 expression significantly reduced the fizzled 5 - regulated luciferase activity in 293t cells , fizzled 5 expression in mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells , the beta - dependent luciferase activity in mcf - 7 cells , and the nuclear translocation of beta - catenin in mda - mb - 231 cells .
mir - 224 inhibition significantly increased the percentages of csc in mcf - 7 cells and enhanced proliferation and migration of mcf - 7 cells .
enhanced mir - 224 expression inhibited proliferation and migration of mda - mb - 231 cells , and the growth of implanted breast cancers in vivo .
induction of frizzled 5 over - expression mitigated the mir - 224 - mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation .
collectively , these data indicated that mir - 224 down - regulated the wnt / beta - catenin signaling possibly by binding to frizzled 5 and inhibited proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells .
mir - 224 wnt / beta - catenin signaling proliferation migration breast cancer cells introduction aberrant activation of the wnt / beta - catenin signaling promotes proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells [ 1 , 2 ] .
the wnt binds to its co - receptors of frizzled to activate dsh , which recruits glycogen synthase kinase - 3 beta ( gsk - 3b ) , promoting beta - catenin nuclear translocation and downstream gene expression [ 3 ] .
hence , down - regulating the wnt / beta - catenin signaling should inhibit proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells .
microrna can bind to the 3 ' terminal untranslation region ( 3'utr ) of targeted mrnas to inhibit their translation and to promote their degradation [ 4 - 6 ] .
previous studies have shown that mir - 224 can bind to the tumor suppressors of tnfalpha - induced protein 1 ( tnfaip1 ) and smad4 , raf kinase inhibitor protein ( rkip ) , apoptosis inhibitor - 5 ( api - 5 ) , ph domain leucine - rich - repeat protein phosphatase 1 ( phlpp1 ) , and phlpp2 to promote the survival and proliferation of colorectal cancer ( crc ) and hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , but bind to the trib1 to promote apoptosis of prostatic cancer cells [ 7 - 11 ] .
furthermore , mir224 binds to the smad4 and homeobox d10 ( hoxd10 ) to promote migration of hcc and crc [ 8 , 12 ] while it binds to the tpd52 to inhibit migration of prostatic cancer pca cells [ 13 ] .
apparently , the regulatory effects of mir - 224 are tissue - specific and depend on the dynamic balance of different signal pathways that regulate proliferation , apoptosis and migration of cancer cells .
there are a few studies on mir - 224 regulating proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells .
a previous study indicates that high levels of mir - 224 are detected in mda - mb - 231 cells to promote migration of mda - mb - 231 cells by targeting the raf kinase inhibitor protein ( rkip ) [ 14 ] .
however , another study reveals that mir - 224 expression is down - regulated during lobular neoplasia progression [ 15 ] , and mir - 224 inhibits migration and invasion of mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells by targeting the cdc42 and cxcr4 [ 16 ] .
currently , little is known about the levels of mir - 224 expression in different types of breast cancers and about how mir - 224 regulates the wnt / beta - catenin signaling , proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells , particularly for breast cancer stem - like cells ( csc ) .
the goal of current studies is to determine the expression of mir - 224 in different types of breast cancers and the role of mir - 224 in the wnt / beta - catenin signaling , proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells .
we examined the mir - 224 expression in different types of breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines as well as the levels of serum mir - 224 in patients with different types of breast cancers by quantitative rt - pcr .
furthermore , we characterized the potential targets of mir - 224 in the wnt / beta - catenin signaling by bioinformatics analysis , dual luciferase , western blot and immunofluorescence assays .
subsequently , we determined the effect of altered mir - 224 expression on the proliferation , migration and wound healing of breast cancer cells in vitro and the growth of implanted xenograft tumors in vivo .
our data indicated that mir - 224 inhibited the wnt / beta - catenin signaling , proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells by down - regulating fizzled 5 expression .
results mir - 224 expression is associated inversely with aggressiveness of breast cancer mir - 224 is an oncogenic regulator in many types of cancers , but the mir - 224 expression in the different types of breast cancers has not been clarified .
to study the expression and the regulatory function of mir - 224 , we examined the relative levels of mir - 224 expression in 45 different molecular types of breast cancer tissues and their co - responding serum samples by quantitative rt - pcr .
the relative levels of mir - 224 expression in 10 luminal b tumors were significantly lower than that in the luminal a tumors , but were significantly higher than that in 15 basal - like and her2 + tumors ( figure 1a ) .
a similar pattern of mir - 224 was detected in serum samples from these breast cancer patients .
further analysis indicated that the relative levels of serum mir - 224 in breast cancer patients with positive lymph node metastasis were significantly lower than that in those without lymph node metastasis ( figure 1b ) .
moreover , the relative levels of mir - 224 in non - tumor mcf - 10a were significantly lower than that in luminal mcf - 7 and zr - 75 - 30 cells and were similar to that in her2 + skbr3 cells ( figure 1c ) .
the relative levels of mir - 224 expression in her2 + skbr3 cells were significantly lower than that in luminal mcf - 7 and zr - 75 - 30 cells , but significantly higher than that in triple negative mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 453 cells ( figure 1c ) .
collectively , mir - 224 expression appeared to be inversely associated with aggressiveness of breast cancers in this population .
figure 1 mir - 224 expression in breast cancers the relative levels of mir - 224 expression in different types of breast cancer tissue and serum samples were determined by quantitative rt - pcr .
furthermore , the relative levels of serum mir - 224 in patients ( n = 15 ) with or without lymph node metastasis ( n = 30 ) were stratified .
finally , the relative levels of mir - 224 in different types of breast cancer cell lines were determined .
data are expressed as individual mean values or the mean +/ - sd of each group of samples from at least 5 separate experiments .

enhanced mir - 224 expression reduces frizzled 5 and inhibits the wnt / beta - catenin signaling in breast cancer cells aberrant activation of the wnt / beta - catenin signaling promotes proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells ( 6 , 7 ) .
we researched the potential sequences in the 3utr of beta - catenin signal events and found that the 3'utr of frizzled 4 and frizzled 5 contained the complementary sequences of mir - 224 ( table s1 ) .
accordingly , we tested whether enhanced mir - 224 expression could change the 3'utr of frizzled 4 , frizzled 5 , frizzled 7 , and tnks2 - regulated luciferase activity by dual luciferase assay .
we found that transfection of 294t cells with mir - 224mimic did not change the frizzled 7 or tnks2 - regulated luciferase activity ( data not shown ) .
in contrast , transfection of 293t cells with mir - 224mimic , but not with mir - 224nc , significantly reduced the frizzled 5 and frizzled 4 - regulated luciferase activity by 81.77 % and 71.47 % , respectively ( figure 2a ) .
furthermore , transfection with mir - 224mimic , but not mir - 224nc , significantly reduced the beta - catenin - dependent firefly luciferase activity in mcf - 7 cells , suggesting that enhanced mir - 224 expression inhibited the wnt / beta - catenin signaling ( figure 2b ) .
in addition , transfection with mir - 224mimic , but not mir - 224nc , significantly reduced the relative levels of frizzled 5 , but not frizzled 4 , expression in mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 2c ) .
moreover , transfection with mir - 224inhibitor significantly increased the ratios of nuclear to cytosolic beta - catenin + mcf - 7 cells ( figure 2d ) .
in contrast , transfection with mir - 224mimic significantly decreased the ratios of nuclear to cytosolic beta - catenin + mda - mb - 231 cells .
collectively , these data indicated that mir - 224 inhibited the wnt / beta - catenin signaling by down - regulating the frizzled 5 expression in breast cancer cells .
figure 2 mir - 224 reduces fizzled 5 expression and inhibits the wnt / beta - catenin signaling in breast cancer cells the potential binding sequences of mir - 224 in the wnt / beta - catenin signal events were characterized by dual luciferase assays , as described in the materials and methods .
mcf - 7 cells were transfected with mir - 224mimic , or mir - 224nc for 24 h. the cells in each well were transfected in triplicate with topflash plasmid and prl - tk plasmid for 48 h. the relative levels of beta - catenin - dependent firefly luciferase activity in individual samples were determined by the dual - luciferase assay .

in addition , mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were transfected with mir - 224nc , mir - 224inhibitor or mir - 224mimic for 48 h and the cytosolic and nuclear beta - catenin protein was stained with fluorescent antibodies and dapi , followed by flow cytometry .

reduced mir - 224 expression increases the percentages of cd44 + cd24 - cscs in mcf - 7 cells breast cscs are crucial for the recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer .
to determine the regulatory function of mir - 224 , mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were transfected with , or without , mir - 224nc , mir - 224 inhibitor or mir - 224mimic for 24 or 48 h , respectively .
the relative levels of mir - 224 in the different groups of cells were determined by quantitative rt - pcr .
we found that transfection with mir - 224inhibitor , but not with mir - 224nc , significantly reduced the levels of mir - 224 expression in mcf - 7 cells , as compared with that in the untransfected controls ( figure 3a ) .
transfection with mir - 224 mimic , but not mir - 224nc , significantly increased the relative levels of mir - 224 expression in mda - mb - 231 cells ( data not shown ) .
after staining with fitc - anti - cd44 and pe - anti - cd24 , we found that transfection with mir - 224inhibitor , but not with mir - 224nc , significantly increased the percentages of cd44 + cd24 - csc in mcf - 7 cells and its promoting effects tended to be time - dependent ( figure 3b and 3c ) .
however , transfection with mir - 224mimic did not significantly change the frequency of cd44 + cd24 - csc in mda - mb - 231 cells .
hence , mir - 224 may inhibit the spontaneous proliferation of breast csc - like mcf - 7 cells in vitro .
figure 3 mir - 224 inhibition increases the percentages of cd44 + cd24 - cscs in mcf - 7 cells mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were transfected with , or without , mir - 224nc , mir - 224inhibitor or mir - 224mimic for 24 or 48 h , respectively .
the relative levels of mir - 224 expression in different groups of cells were determined by quantitative rt - pcr .
the cells were stained with fitc - anti - cd44 and pe - anti - cd24 and the frequency of cd44 + cd24 - cscs was determined by flow cytometry .

mir - 224 inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells next , we further examined whether altered mir - 224 expression could change proliferation of breast cancer cells by mtt assay .
mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were transfected with , or without , mir - 224nc , mir - 224inhibitor or mir - 224mimic for 24 or 48 h , respectively .
we found that transfection with mir - 224nc did not change proliferation of mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 4 ) .
transfection with mir - 224inhibitor significantly enhanced proliferation of mcf - 7 cells while transfection with mir - 224mimic significantly inhibited proliferation of mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 4a ) .
their regulatory effects tended to be time - dependent .
figure 4 mir - 224 inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were transfected with , or without , mir - 224nc , mir - 224inhibitor , or mir - 224mimic for 24 or 48 h , respectively .
furthermore , mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were transfected with a plasmid for frizzled 5 expression , which was characterized by western blot assays .
subsequently , the cells were transfected with mir - 224nc , or mir - 224mimic for 48 h. the proliferation of different groups of breast cancer cells was determined by mtt assay .
data are representative images or expressed as the mean +/ - sd of each group of cells from three separate experiments .
( a ) the proliferation of mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells .
( b ) western blot analysis of the relative levels of frizzled 5 expression in mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 2231 cells .
the relative levels of frizzled 5 in over - expressing mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were designated as 1 .
( c ) the proliferation of frizzled 5 - over - expressing mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells .
* p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 .
given that enhanced mir - 224 expression significantly reduced the relative levels of frizzled 5 expression and the wnt / beta - catenin signaling in breast cancer cells , we examined whether induction of frizzled 5 over - expression could mitigate the mir - 224 - mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation .
after induction of frizzled 5 over - expression in mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 4b ) , we found that transfection with mir - 224mimic significantly inhibited proliferation of control mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells , but not frizzled 5 - over - expressing mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 4c ) .
therefore , enhanced mir - 224 expression inhibited spontaneous proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro , which was abrogated by frizzled 5 over - expression .
mir - 224 inhibits migration of breast cancer cells next , we examined whether altered mir - 224 expression could change the migration of breast cancer cells by transwell migration and wound healing assays .
mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were transfected with mir - 224nc , mir - 224inhibitor or mir - 224mimic for 24 or 48 h. we found that transfection with mir - 224nc did not alter the migration of mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 5a ) .
while transfection with mir - 224inhibitor increased the numbers of migrated mcf - 7 cells transfection with mir - 224mimic significantly reduced the numbers of migrated mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 5a ) .
similarly , transfection with mir - 224inhibitor significantly increased the migration distance of mcf - 7 cells , but transfection with mir - 224mimic significantly decreased the migration distance of mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 5b ) .
therefore , mir - 224 inhibited the migration of breast cancer cells in vitro .
figure 5 mir - 224 inhibits the migration and wound healing of breast cancer cells mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells were transfected with , or without , mir - 224nc , mir - 224inhibitor , or mir - 224mimic , respectively .
four hours after transfection , the migration of different groups of breast cancer cells for the indicated time points was determined by transwell migration assay .
in addition , two days after transfection , the wound healing of different groups of cells within 24 or 48 h was tested .
data are representative images and expressed as the mean +/ - sd of each group of cells from three separate experiments .
( a ) the migration of breast cancer cells .
( b ) the wound healing of breast cancer .
* p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 .
enhanced mir - 224 expression inhibits the growth of implanted breast cancers in vivo finally , we examined whether enhanced mir - 224 could change the dynamic growth of implanted breast cancers in vivo .
we found that the relative levels of mir - 224 in the mir - 224mimic stably expressing mda - mb - 231 cells were about 2.5 - fold higher than that in the mir - 224nc stably expressing mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 6a ) .
the tumor volumes in the mice implanted with mir - 224mimic stably expressing mda - mb - 231 cells were significantly smaller than that implanted with mir - 224nc stably expressing mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 6b ) .
further analysis indicated the relative levels of mir - 224 expression in the tumors induced by mir - 224mimic stably expressing mda - mb - 231 cells were significantly higher than that in the tumoes induced by mir - 224nc stably expressing cells ( figure 6c ) .
therefore , enhanced mir - 224 expression significantly inhibited the growth of implanted breast cancers in mice .
figure 6 mir - 224 inhibits the growth of implanted breast tumors in vivo mda - mb - 231 cells were induced for stable expression of mir - 224mimic or control mir - 224nc and the relative levels of mir - 224 expression in the mir - 224 stably over - expressing mda - 231 / mir - 224 mimic or control cells were determined by quantitative rt - pcr .
subsequently , individual groups of cells were implanted into female nude mice and the growth of implanted tumors were monitored at the indicated time points post inoculation .
at the end of this experiment ( on day 26 post inoculation ) , the tumors were dissected and the relative levels of mir - 224 expression in the different groups of tumors were determined by quantitative rt - pcr .
data are expressed as the mean +/ - sd of each group of mice ( n = 8 per group ) .
( a ) the relative levels of mir - 224 expression .
( b ) the tumor volumes .
( c ) the relative levels of mir - 224 .
the relative levels of mir - 224 in the mir - 2224nc - transfected controls were designated as 1 .
* p < 0.05 ; *** p < 0.001 vs. the tumors induced by the mir - 224 nc - transfected control mda - mb - 231 cells .
discussion in this study , we first explored the relative levels of mir - 224 in different types of breast cancer tissues by quantitative rt - pcr .
we found that the relative levels of mir - 224 in luminal b type of breast cancer tissues were significantly lower than that in the luminal a type of tissues , but significantly higher than that in the her2 + and basal - like triple negative breast cancer tissues in this population .
furthermore , we detected a similar pattern of serum mir - 224 in these patients .
in addition , the relative levels of serum mir - 224 in breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis were significantly lower than that in those without lymph node metastasis .
our findings extended previous observations of down - regulated mir - 224 expression in breast lobular neoplasia [ 15 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , this was the first report that the relative levels of mir - 224 in different types of breast cancer tissues were associated inversely with the aggressiveness of breast cancers .
although mir - 224 has been shown to promote tumorigenesis of hcc , crc and gastric cancers [ 7 - 9 ] our data suggest that mir - 224 may inhibit the development and progression of breast cancers .
hence , our findings argue that mir - 224 may have varying functions in regulating the development and progression of different types of cancers .
we are interested in further investigating the potential prognostic values of mir - 224 levels in those breast cancer patients .
aberrant activation of the wnt / beta - catenin signaling is crucial for the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells .
in this study , we found that the 3'utr of fizzled 4 and fizzled 5 contained complementary sequences for mir - 224 binding and transfection with mir - 224mimic dramatically reduced the luciferase activity regulated by the 3'utr of fizzled5 and frizzled 4 in 293t cells .
furthermore , enhanced mir - 224 expression significantly reduced the beta - catenin - dependent luciferase activity and the fizzled 5 expression in mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells , and attenuated beta - catenin nuclear translocation in mda - mb - 231 cells .
in contrast , knockdown of mir - 224 expression inhibited beta - catenin nuclear translocation in mcf - 7 cells .
more interestingly , induction of frizzled 5 over - expression mitigated the mir - 224mimic - mediated inhibition on proliferation of mcf - 7 and mda - mb - 231 cells .
collectively , these novel data suggest that mir - 224 may bind to the wnt receptor of fizzled5 to impair the wnt / beta - catenin signaling in breast cancer cells .
hence , mir - 224 may be a natural inhibitor of the wnt / beta - catenin signaling and valuable for intervention of breast cancer .
there are several mirnas that inhibit or enhance the wnt / beta - catenin signaling during the development of different types of tumor , including breast cancer [ 17 ] .
mir - 135 and mir - 142 inhibit the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) expression to enhance the wnt / beta - catenin signaling and tumor cell proliferation and migration [ 18 , 19 ] while mir - 200a , mir - 203 , mir - 214 , mir - 1826 , mir - 320 and others attenuate the wnt / beta - catenin signaling by targeting beta - catenin to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and migration [ 20 - 26 ] .
hence , these mirnas form a complex network to regulate the wnt / beta - catenin signaling during the development and progression of tumors .
inhibition of the wnt / beta - catenin signaling can attenuate proliferation and migration of cancer cells , particularly for csc [ 27 ] .
we found that knockdown of mir - 224 significantly increased the percentages of cd44 + cd24 - cscs in mcf - 7 cells and proliferation of mcf - 7 cells .
in contrast , enhanced mir - 224 expression attenuated proliferation of mda - mb - 231 cells and growth of implanted breast cancers in vivo , but did not significantly change the frequency of cd44 + cd24 - cscs in mda - mb - 231 cells .
given that the relative levels of mir - 224 in mcf - 7 cells were significantly higher than that in mda - mb - 231 cells the different responses of csc to altered levels of mir - 224 may be because mcf - 7 csc might be more sensitive to mir - 224 regulation than mda - mb - 231 csc .
while mir - 224 inhibition promoted migration of mcf - 7 cells enhanced mir - 224 expression attenuated migration of mda - mb - 231 cells .
it is possible that mir - 224 reduced frizzled 5 expression , which impaired the wnt / beta - catenin signaling , the wnt - mediated beta - catenin - independent planar cell polarity and the wnt / ca ++ signaling to inhibit migration of breast cancer cells [ 28 , 29 ] .
our data were consistent with a previous report that mir - 224 inhibits invasion of mda - mb - 231 by targeting the cdc42 and cxcr4 expression [ 16 ] .
however , our data were inconsistent with another report that mir - 224 binds to the rkip to promote migration of mda - mb - 231 cells [ 14 ] .
the distinct outcomes may stem from varying experimental conditions because mir - 224 can bind to many molecules , including the rkip , smad4 , api - 5 , phlpp1 , phlpp2 , trib1 , hoxd10 , tpd52 , cdc42 and cxcr4 [ 7 - 9 , 14 - 16 ] .
hence , the outcome of mir - 224 - regulated breast cancer cells may depend on the dynamic balance of different signal pathways that regulate their proliferation , apoptosis and migration of cancer cells .
we are interested in further investigating the role of mir - 224 in regulating the progression of breast cancer in vivo .
in summary , our data indicated that the relative levels of mir - 224 expression were associated inversely with aggressiveness of different types of breast cancers .
enhanced mir - 224 expression reduced the fizzled 5 expression and inhibited the wnt / beta - catenin signaling , proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells as well as growth of implanted breast cancers in mice .
our data may provide new insights into the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells .
potentially , our novel findings may aid in design of new therapies for intervention of breast cancer .

( 2009 ) input subsidies to improve smallholder maize productivity in malawi : toward an african green revolution .
plos biol 7 ( 1 ) : e1000023 .
doi : 10.1371 / journal.pbio.1000023 emerging from the worst harvest in a decade , the government of malawi implemented one of the most ambitious and successful assaults on hunger in the history of the african continent. through a national input subsidy program , coinciding with better rainfall conditions , maize production doubled in 2006 and almost tripled in 2007. from a 43 % national food deficit in 2005 , malawi achieved a 53 % surplus in 2007 , some of which was exported to neighboring countries .
an associated decline in the price of maize conveys important benefits to low - income urban and rural households that are net food consumers .
malawi 's recent experience may provide important lessons for achieving food security through smallholders in africa .
agricultural productivity improvements have long been viewed as the foundation for economic prosperity and social development [ 1 - 3 ] .
asia 's green revolution began in the 1960s with the development of fertilizer - responsive , high - yielding varieties of rice and wheat [ 4 ] .
global average yields of these staple crops more than doubled over this period with greatest impact in regions with irrigation or more reliable rainfall .
improved access to fertilizer through state - supported subsidies , rural credit , and improved infrastructure contributed to strong productivity growth in both crops .
asian governments also supported the uptake of new technology through research and extension , and intervened in the market though price support [ 5,6 ] .
in contrast , agricultural productivity growth in sub - saharan africa has not kept pace with population growth .
the per capita growth rate of agricultural gross domestic product was negative during the 1980s and 1990s , though improvements have been noted since 2000 [ 6 ] .
production growth of the major african food crops ( maize and root crops ) was based almost entirely on extending the cultivated area , with only minor contributions from yield growth [ 4 ] .
poor infrastructure and related high transport costs ( for both inputs and surplus production ) , inadequate institutional support ( credit and extension ) , political instability , diverse agroecological complexities , low fertilizer use , and the limited availability of suitable high - yielding varieties have all contributed to low agricultural productivity growth in africa [ 4 - 6 ] .
the slower productivity growth in africa compared with asia masks a number of limited successes that could point to a latent african green revolution .
recognizing the role of agriculture in stimulating economic growth and reducing rural poverty , african governments promoted fertilizer use during the 1970s and early 1980s [ 7 ] through several interventions , including direct subsidies that reduced fertilizer prices for farmers , government - financed and - managed input credit programs , centralized fertilizer procurement and distribution , and control of output markets .
impressive improvements in maize productivity were demonstrated in kenya , zimbabwe , and zambia during the 1980s [ 8 ] .
cereal crop output in ethiopia has dramatically increased over the past decade [ 9 ] .
several other studies have shown the potential of input subsidies in accelerating crop production [ 10 - 12 ] .
however , these positive results were generally not sustained with the advent of donor - driven structural adjustment and the dismantling of government - supported institutions and subsidies. by the turn of the century , fertilizer use in africa was only 8 kg / ha , compared with 96 kg / ha in east and southeast asia and 101 kg / ha in south asia [ 7 ] .
today , africa accounts for less than 1 % of global fertilizer consumption .
a world bank synthesis of lessons learned from earlier efforts to promote fertilizer use on the continent [ 7 ] attributed this failure to high and unsustainable fiscal and administrative costs , governments' weak capacity to implement programs , and governments' inability to take account of the diversity of production systems and farmers' needs .
donors , led by the world bank , argued for the abolition of state - led interventions including subsidies .
as a result , many government input supply agencies were dissolved or privatized .
under these circumstances , fertilizer costs rose sharply and constrained adoption of fertilizer use by small - scale farmers .
the world bank study concluded that " although these reforms had generated positive impacts on government budgets , they resulted in significant reductions in overall levels of fertilizer use and increased food insecurity among many rural households " [ 7 , p. 4 ] .
this policy failure caused a serious reassessment among governments , creating the setting for a return to subsidies as a potential intervention for promoting food security and agricultural growth .
against the broader continent - wide trend , fertilizer use by smallholder farmers in kenya has increased dramatically since the early 1990s [ 7 ] .
this apparent anomaly has been attributed to four main factors : stable fertilizer market policies leading to rapid expansion of private fertilizer distribution networks ; reduction in the average distance between farmers and fertilizer retailers ; greater competition among importers and wholesalers ; and high profitability of kenya 's horticulture industry leading to maize - horticulture intercrops [ 7 ] .
however , this country - level impact of market liberalization remains concentrated in more favorable and wealthier regions of the country where farmers earn sufficient cash from other enterprises , such as horticulture and dairy farming , to buy maize fertilizer .
in one of kenya 's poorest and most food - insecure regions , the western lowlands , 87 % of smallholders use no fertilizer on maize [ 13 ] .
while generally praising kenya 's progress in fertilizer market liberalization , a recent study of fertilizer policies and use in kenya [ 13 ] acknowledged the fragility of the kenyan success story and concluded : " because mean household incomes are higher in kenya compared with many other african countries , the impressive market - led growth in smallholder fertilizer use in kenya may not be easily transferable to areas where effective demand is highly constrained " [ 13 , p. 39 ] .
in malawi , recent success with input subsidies highlights how pro - poor public investments in maize productivity improvement can be made cost - effectively .
this essay examines the circumstances , results , and implications from the 2005 - 2006 and 2006 - 2007 national input subsidy programs , and describes the experience of more intensive support undertaken by the millennium villages project ( mvp ) in one district of southern malawi .
smallholder maize production in malawi malawi is a landlocked tropical country of more than 13 million people .
its economy is heavily dependent on agriculture , which employs 78 % of the national labor force [ 14 ] .
maize is grown by 97 % of farming households and accounts for 60 % of total calorie consumption .
almost all maize is grown without irrigation during the single rainy season from october to april , which is subject to rainfall variability that can be particularly damaging when short dry spells occur during the critical flowering and early grain filling stages [ 15 ] .
decades of intensive cultivation by smallholders , in the absence of significant fertilizer use , have depleted soils of nutrients , particularly nitrogen [ 16,17 ] .
national yields of maize have averaged 1.3 metric tons per hectare ( t / ha ) during the last 20 years [ 9 ] .
in contrast , the average yield of rainfed maize in iowa in the united states ( 1997 - 2007 ) exceeded 10 t / ha [ 18 ] .
over half of malawi 's farming households operate below subsistence .
because of low productivity and small farm size , only 20 % of maize farmers produce surplus and sell their product .
on - farm storage losses are high .
as a result , most households purchase maize at much higher prices when stocks are exhausted , typically during january to march [ 14 ] .
to cope with food deficits , households reduce daily maize consumption , increase consumption of alternative calorie sources ( such as cassava ) , sell assets ( such as livestock ) , and seek employment on large commercial estates or in towns [ 14 ] .
theft of crops in the field is common during severe food shortages , prompting farmers to harvest unripe green maize for immediate consumption .
food insecurity also encourages unsafe sexual practices leading to higher incidence of hiv / aids , other sexually transmitted diseases , teenage pregnancies , and abortions [ 19 ] .
gender and theft - related violence increase. and school attendance usually drops during times of food shortage .
these dire circumstances underscore the urgent need to improve smallholder maize productivity through an african green revolution [ 20 ] .
the technology and the knowledge to improve maize yields in malawi have existed for at least three decades [ 21,22 ] .
the challenge , identified in july 2004 by then united nations secretary - general kofi annan , is to " turn this knowledge into practice " and thereby " take the first steps out of chronic poverty " [ 20 , p. 19 ] .
2005 food emergency leads to a bold policy decision the 2004 - 2005 maize season ( planted october - december 2004 and harvested april - june 2005 ) was the worst in a decade ( figure 1 ) .
many parts of the country went without rain for up to one month during january and february - - the critical tasseling and ear development stages for maize - - with a devastating effect on yields : the national average was only 0.76 t / ha , 40 % below the long - term average .
total maize production for 2004 - 2005 was 24 % less than the previous year , amounting to 57 % of the estimated national maize food requirement [ 9 ] .
figure 1 national maize production and maize food requirement over 25 years compiled from [ 9,49 ] .
unusual dips and spikes in maize requirement are a reflection of inconsistency in methods of national population determination .
in may 2005 , the malawi vulnerability assessment committee concluded that over 4.2 million people required food aid [ 23 ] .
the food situation was deteriorating rapidly , and a major humanitarian relief operation began [ 24 ]. by november 2005 , as the maize prices in local markets continued to rise , the estimate went up to 5 million malawians - - 38 % of the population - - in need of food aid [ 15 ] .
in response to recurring food deficits , the government decided to invest in subsidizing agricultural inputs , an approach that was being vigorously promoted by the un millennium project [ 25 ] .
this policy attracted objections from some major donors [ 26 ] who were concerned about the potential cost and the absence of a clear exit strategy .
those same donors had earlier supported a starter pack program in 1998 - 1999 and 1999 - 2000 whereby small packages of fertilizer , maize seed , and legume seed , sufficient for 0.1 ha , were distributed free to almost all maize smallholders in malawi [ 27 ] .
this program led to an extra 280,000 to 420,000 t maize produced .
however , the main donors scaled down their support to starter pack , citing operational weaknesses , lack of targeting to the poorest households , and the negative impact on diversification efforts [ 28 ] .
the sharp reduction in the coverage of the program was reflected in national production statistics ( figure 1 ) .
malawi once again fell below self - sufficiency and resumed its dependency on food aid [ 19,27 ] .
in the face of adverse donor reactions , and after heated parliamentary debate , the government used discretionary budget funds and support from the un to import fertilizer and procure improved maize seed for distribution to farmers. through the national input subsidy program , the government allocated coupons to buy sufficient fertilizer to grow maize on one acre ( 0.4 ha ) , a 4 - fold increase in the amount provided under starter pack , as well as 3 kg of maize seed - - an insufficient amount ( 10 kg of seed are needed for 0.4 ha ) necessitated by funding constraints .
seed , of a limited number of government - recommended open pollinated varieties ( opvs ) , was sold at less than one third of the market rate .
the total market value of the inputs was mk5,500 ( us $ 44.00 ) , of which the farmers paid mk2,050 ( us $ 16.40 ) , representing an overall 63 % subsidy .
coupons were allocated across regions and then distributed to districts and traditional authorities ( sub - district government entities ) , who allocated them to village development committees , which identified the recipients .
all of the subsidized fertilizer and seed was distributed through government agencies [ 29 ] .
including late distribution of supplementary coupons , 3.4 million coupons were issued ( 73 % of these were for maize cultivation ) , of which 75 % were redeemed [ 29 ] .
a total of 132,000 t fertilizer ( 22,000 t of which were for tobacco fertilizers ) and 6,000 t of improved maize seed were made available .
the total cost of the program was estimated at mk7.2 billion ( us $ 58 million ) , representing the direct costs of purchase and distribution of fertilizer , net of sales receipts [ 29 ] .
excluding the cost of tobacco fertilizer , the cost of the maize subsidy in 2005 - 2006 is estimated at approximately us $ 50 million .
there was no explicit targeting of subsidies toward the poor , who represented 54 % of the population in 2005 [ 14 ] .
this was another criticism from donors and a reason for their slow support .
however , there was officially a maximum allocation of two 50 kg bags per household .
this upper limit was intended to reduce the potential for capture of subsidies by larger farmers .
a bumper harvest in 2006 the 2005 - 2006 season had good rains , and total maize production was more than double the 2004 - 2005 harvest , producing a surplus of 510,000 t above the national maize requirement ( table 1 ) .
maize yields averaged 1.59 t / ha , doubling the 0.76 t / ha of the drought - affected 2004 - 2005 season .
incremental maize production attributed to the fertilizer subsidy was estimated at 300,000 to 400,000 t [ 30 ] .
table 1 malawi 's national maize production , food self - sufficiency , and the malawi maize production index , 2000 - 2001 to 2006 - 2007 the 2005 - 2006 growing season was clearly more favorable for maize production than the drought - affected 2004 - 2005 season but was broadly comparable to the 2001 - 2002 and 2002 - 2003 seasons , when relatively small subsidies were provided .
maize production in 2005 - 2006 was higher than in the 2001 - 2002 and 2002 - 2003 seasons by 1.02 million t and 600,000 t , respectively , suggesting a large incremental impact of the subsidy beyond the effect of better rainfall .
encouraged by this achievement , the government continued the subsidy program for the 2006 - 2007 season .
while donors acknowledged the impact of the 2005 - 2006 subsidy , they argued for increasing the participation of the private sector , especially the agro - dealer network .
the government recognized the need to partner with the private sector , but expressed concerns in the event of unsold government stocks , unreliable seed quality , and inability to reach the more remote areas that were not served by the private sector .
after the uk department for international development offered technical and financial support , a compromise was reached whereby the government was financially buffered against possible unsold stocks , input distribution was supported by a professional logistics unit , and seed and fertilizer quality was monitored .
continued success in 2007 for the 2006 - 2007 season , the input subsidy program was repeated on a similar scale to 2005 - 2006 .
a total of 3.5 million coupons for maize fertilizer were distributed , targeted to maize - growing households , to enable purchase of the same amounts of fertilizer at the same price as in the previous year .
two million seed coupons were also distributed , each enabling recipients to obtain 3 kg of opv seed or 2 kg hybrid seed , depending on the farmers' choice and seed availability .
according to government of malawi estimates [ 29 ] , overall coupon redemption was 95 % for fertilizer and 91 % for seed , higher than in the previous season .
the government met 87 % of the net subsidy cost .
the private sector distributed 28 % of the fertilizer and all of the seed .
seventy - six percent of farmers opted for the higher - yielding hybrids over the less expensive opvs [ 29 ] , challenging perceptions among some donors and nongovernmental organizations that hybrid varieties were inappropriate for small - scale farmers ( box 1 ) .
box 1 : opvs versus hybrids in malawi and throughout africa , there is debate about the relative merits of opvs and hybrid varieties of maize [ 45 ] .
smallholder maize production in africa has traditionally been based on the use of opvs , whereby the seed is retained from year to year .
over time , through farmer selection , these traditional opvs , known as landraces , become well adapted to the particular farm environment .
improved opvs have been bred and selected for special characteristics such as drought tolerance and disease resistance .
seed can be recycled by farmers for a maximum of three years without significant yield loss .
opvs typically yield 10 % - 25 % less than hybrids [ 45 ] .
hybrid maize is produced by crossing two genetically unrelated inbred parents .
the resulting seed exhibits hybrid vigor , but recycled hybrid seed will not breed true in subsequent generations , and can result in yield losses of 30 % or more , reducing and perhaps eliminating any yield advantage in subsequent planting [ 45 ] .
hybrids are more uniform and generally higher yielding than opvs .
the government of malawi launched a hybrid breeding program in 1950 , following a severe drought in 1949 [ 46 ] .
the first hybrids were released in 1958 and by the 1990s were adopted by about a quarter of malawi 's smallholders .
research indicated a consistent yield advantage of hybrids over local maize varieties at all levels of fertilizer use , including in a drought year [ 22,47 ] .
this yield advantage of hybrids remained even under low soil fertility and drought conditions .
on balance , the yield advantage of hybrids appears robust for smallholder maize production in malawi .
however , the choice of hybrids versus opvs is constrained by a complex set of factors including the higher seed cost and the often poorer storage and processing characteristics of hybrids [ 47 ] .
during the second year of the malawi input subsidy program , voucher recipients were given a choice of opv or hybrids : 2 kg of hybrid seed or 3 kg improved opv , depending on supplier costs .
based on coupon redemption , 76 % of farmers chose hybrids over opvs [ 29 ] .
thus , in malawi , there is clearly a strong farmer preference for hybrids over improved opvs provided that the prices of seed and fertilizer are subsidized .
hybrid seed is generally more expensive than opvs because of the higher cost of seed production and private sector control over supplies .
farmers in lower potential environments often find it difficult to recover the costs of hybrid seed and fertilizer .
in the absence of deep subsidies to both seed and fertilizer , risk perceptions of small - scale farmers , especially in low potential rainfed environments , have been shown to constrain adoption of hybrid maize [ 47,48 ] .
the 2006 - 2007 harvest was estimated at 3.44 million t , an all - time national record for malawi , generating a surplus of about 1.34 million t of maize grain above national requirements ( table 1 , figure 1 ) .
the incremental effect of the fertilizer subsidy on maize production was estimated at 670,000 t for 2006 - 2007 , valued at us $ 117 million in additional crop production , assuming a maize producer price of us $ 175 / t. the total program cost in 2006 - 2007 was us $ 72 million [ 29 ] , approximately us $ 62 million of which was directed to maize fertilizer and seed costs. by late 2007 , malawi had exported over 300,000 t of maize to zimbabwe , not only generating income for its smallholder farmers , but contributing to regional food security [ 15 ] .
the government decided to continue the program in 2007 - 2008 .
the poor harvest of 2004 - 2005 led to a sharp rise in the price of maize sold at local markets throughout malawi [ 15 ]. by june 2006 , with most of the 2005 - 2006 crop harvested , the average price had dropped by 61 %. with the effects of the 2006 - 2007 bumper crop , the maize price dropped still further .
anecdotal evidence pointed to a modest increase in maize prices in some markets during august - october 2007 due to procurement for export to zimbabwe .
since then , global food shortages have maintained prices at levels attractive to farmers [ 15 ] .
these results suggest that the maize consumers in malawi have benefited from the two successive strong harvests and the related price declines .
this outcome is fully consistent with experience in asia [ 4 ] and suggests an important potential impact of seed and fertilizer subsidies on food security for the poorest households that are net consumers even after good harvests .
further research is needed to understand the impact of the subsidy on maize consumers .
displacement of commercial sales by subsidized fertilizer was estimated at 60 % in 2005 - 2006 and 54 % in 2006 - 2007 [ 29 ] .
while this raised concerns from the business community , the results must be weighed against the net social impact of achieving national food security .
experience from the mvp ( below ) , which operates in low - income " hunger hot - spots ," is revealing that commercial sales actually increase in the poorest areas that were previously unserved or underserved by agricultural input dealers .
in time , stimulating agricultural productivity will likely increase commercial activity in rural areas and extend new opportunities for agricultural input suppliers .
millennium villages : deepening and broadening rural investment concurrent with the implementation of the national input subsidy program , the mvp was established in malawi .
the mvp is an integrated rural development approach that supports public - sector investments , leading to increased private - sector saving and investments [ 31 ] .
the mvp began a year earlier in sauri village in western kenya , achieving average maize yields of over 5 t / ha , and meeting 166 % of basic caloric requirements [ 31 ] .
inspired by sauri 's early success , the mvp employed a similar approach in malawi .
a total of 11,000 farming households in and around the village of mwandama in zomba district were identified for a program of intensified multisectoral support beginning in the 2005 - 2006 season .
during august to october 2005 , several rounds of consultation were held with the mwandama community .
these revealed major concerns about food security and the ability to recover from the 2004 - 2005 crop failure .
women were especially vocal about food shortages .
despite their desperation , farmers expressed an urgent need for seed and fertilizer over food aid , although aid was also required for the worst affected households .
however , most farmers in these severely affected areas did not even have enough money to take advantage of the national fertilizer subsidy , revealing the need to modify the policies of the national input subsidy program .
instead of purchasing inputs at subsidized rates , each household in the millennium villages received 10 kg of hybrid maize seed and the recommended fertilizer inputs for a typical smallholder farm of 0.4 ha. farmers were also trained in the " sasakawa " planting method advocated by sasakawa global 2000 [ 32 ] , using closer ridge spacing ( 75 cm apart ) and single seeds ( 25 cm apart ) instead of the traditional method of planting multiple seeds 50 cm apart along the ridges .
the main differences with the broader national subsidy program were ( 1 ) enough seed was provided to plant 0.4 ha maize , and ( 2 ) farmers were not required to pay for the fertilizer up front .
instead , after harvest , the recipients were required to repay a portion of the input cost ( around 30 %) in kind to a school meal program to be implemented in their villages .
farmers welcomed the availability of seed , fertilizer , and extension services .
aided by a better than average rainy season , the intervention package resulted in unprecedented productivity improvements .
in mwandama village , 1,000 farmers obtained an average yield of 6.50 t / ha - - more than four times the officially estimated national average for 2005 - 2006 .
in the broader cluster of 11 millennium villages around and including mwandama , 11,000 farmers averaged a yield of 5.18 t / ha ( random sample of 90 fields ) , compared with a yield of 2.21 t / ha ( random sample of 30 fields ) from non - intervention areas ( where farmers had access to the national subsidy program ) ( table 2 ) .
table 2 partitioning the yield increases at mwandama cluster of 11,000 farms the interventions were repeated for the 2006 - 2007 season .
the only difference was the addition of 3 kg groundnut seed and 2 kg pigeon pea seed to encourage crop diversification .
the yields obtained in 2006 - 2007 dropped sharply to 3.61 t / ha , primarily because of poor seed germination due to a two - week dry spell following the germinating rains .
however , even under these circumstances , farmers in the mwandama cluster gained 2.11 t / ha from the additional inputs ( table 2 ) .
to estimate the relative effects of rainfall and inputs ( here defined as the combination of hybrid seed , fertilizer , and sasakawa plant spacing ) on maize yields , the 2004 - 2005 drought - affected crop that received little fertilizer was used as a baseline .
the rainfall effect for the 2005 - 2006 season was then estimated by comparing the 2004 - 2005 yield ( farmers' estimates ) with the 2005 - 2006 estimates based on crop cuts of fields adjacent to the mwandama mvp cluster .
using this simple estimation technique , the rainfall effect is 32 % .
the balance of 68 % accounts for the use of improved inputs .
the results for 2006 - 2007 indicated a similar effect .
thus , in both years , the rainfall effect appears to account for 25 % - 32 % of the yield increase .
the balance can be attributed to the use of improved seed , fertilizer application , and related extension advice .
the impact of the interventions in the mvp undoubtedly means the difference between a food deficit experienced in " normal years " and a significant surplus above normal consumption needs , which is about 1,000 kg / year for the average family farm size of 5.5 people .
older farmers reported that they had never before experienced or even seen maize crops like these , except on nearby large commercial estates .
the inclusion of the millennium villages data complements the experience gained from malawi 's national input subsidy program .
the results demonstrated that there remains a very large yield gap between maize yields achieved at the national level ( even with a substantial subsidy ) and potential yields based on whole farm intensified support .
lessons learned political will and action provide the foundation for change .
the use of fertilizer subsidies had been actively discouraged by donors for two decades .
the perceived high cost and trade - offs with other development investments , the absence of clear time - bound exit strategies , and difficulty targeting the poorest of the poor have led many donors to withhold their support to input subsidy programs .
anti - subsidy bias was well established in malawi in 2005 , and there was little encouragement from donors for the government to implement the program described in this essay .
at the africa summit of the world economic forum in cape town , south africa , referring to the situation in malawi in 2005 and his commitment to act and provide input subsidies , president bingu wa mutharika said : " enough is enough .
i am not going to go on my knees to beg for food .
let us grow the food ourselves. and indeed we have . "
[ 33 ] .
this political leadership has effectively buffered malawi from the economically and socially destructive effects of the global food price increases of 2007 and 2008 .
carryover stocks have meant that malawi is no longer dependent on food aid and costly commercial imports .
importantly , malawi is now the focus of international attention as a result of some high - profile coverage in the international press [ 34,35 ] .
initially with some reluctance , but with increasing interest and engagement , several donors have begun to work with the government to support and improve the effectiveness of the input subsidy program for smallholders .
a national - scale program of this urgency is feasible although operational challenges remain .
despite the enormous human resource capacity and infrastructure challenges facing malawi , this national scale input subsidy program has been a success as measured by unprecedented production levels. with modest technical and financial support from donors , the logistical challenges of reaching over 2 million smallholder farmers were overcome during the starter pack program ( 1998 - 1999 and 1999 - 2000 ) [ 27 ] and again in 2005 - 2006 and 2006 - 2007 through the national input subsidy program .
a number of operational challenges have been identified [ 29 ] and are being addressed by the government in redesigning the program .
these included : delays in program design and implementation leading to delayed delivery of inputs in some areas ; cumbersome coupon processing and redemption systems ; the need to improve program information sharing with the intended beneficiaries and general public ; and shortages of fertilizers and mismatch of coupons and fertilizer types in some areas .
two major remaining challenges are the absence of private agro - dealers in remote rural areas and limited human and financial capacity of government agencies to meet the operational demands of the program [ 29 ] .
however , each year of implementation has resulted in design improvements that are now inspiring other countries to emulate the malawi experience .
knowledge exists to increase smallholder maize productivity and sharply reduce food insecurity .
the interventions implemented are straightforward practices that were developed by malawian researchers and their international partners .
the central biological basis for productivity improvement is the response of maize to nitrogen fertilizer application .
the widespread occurrence of nitrogen deficiency in africa and the availability of well adapted maize varieties , both hybrids and opvs , mean that malawi 's experience is relevant beyond its borders .
importantly , these improved practices have been successfully applied by smallholders , suggesting that development of large - scale commercial farming may not be essential for the achievement of national or household food security in africa .
indeed , questions may be raised as to whether large estates that currently occupy over 1 million ha in malawi are an efficient use of the country 's limited land resources .
supporting inputs rather than output subsidies , such as food aid , makes economic sense .
the results from the mvp showed that the provision of about us $ 60 of inputs ( seed and fertilizer based on full unsubsidized cost ) generated an extra 0.8 to 1.2 t of maize for a farmer on 0.4 ha. this extra food can be valued at us $ 140 to us $ 210 based on local prices during lean times ( assuming us $ 175 / t ) , a benefit to cost ratio of at least 2.3 in just six to nine months .
while the external evaluation of the 2006 - 2007 subsidy program estimated a modest benefit / cost ratio of 0.76 to 1.36 [ 29 ] , the indirect benefits on education , health , and social stability were not included .
moreover , this financial analysis did not consider the future stream of benefits flowing from the long - term rural economic transformation .
the evaluation noted that the yield response to inputs , and thus the benefit to cost ratio , can be greatly improved by the timely delivery and use of inputs and better extension advice .
the mvp demonstrated the impact of more efficient input use and therefore provides a standard against which improvements in national productivity can be measured .
the cost of achieving food security is fiscally manageable and responsible .
the budgetary allocation , representing less than 7 % of the 2005 - 2006 national budget ( us $ 5 / person / year ) , supplemented in 2006 - 2007 by donor support ( less than us $ 1 / person / year ) , is a remarkably small price to pay for achieving national food self - sufficiency and widespread household food security. by comparison , the cost of importing food in 2004 - 2005 was us $ 110 million ( about us $ 8 per person ) .
donor aid to malawi in 2005 was us $ 578 million or about us $ 44 per person [ 36 ] .
on this basis , there should be little concern about the affordability of a program that has such profound and immediate impact on the lives of so many malawians .
moreover , the export of surplus maize to zimbabwe in 2007 - 2008 was estimated to generate over us $ 120 million .
nevertheless , the dramatic increases in fertilizer prices over the past 12 months require greater attention to fertilizer use efficiency and the use of complementary approaches to improving soil fertility ( see later section on future challenges ) .
pro - poor " smart " input subsidies work .
under the input subsidy program , most beneficiaries had access to the same quantity of inputs , irrespective of farm size .
this implies that the smaller the farm , the greater the effective input level on a per hectare basis .
during the past 20 years , large surpluses over requirements were obtained in 1993 , 1999 , 2000 , 2006 , and 2007 , all years when large - scale input subsidies were implemented ( figure 1 ) .
the bulk of these surpluses was generated by smallholders .
these results should not imply that fertilizer subsidies benefit all poor households .
in cases where households have little or no land and / or are constrained by labor ( e.g. , as a result of sickness or household age structure ) , alternative approaches such as social cash transfer programs should be considered .
maize consumers are benefiting from lower prices , but future challenges will arise with continuing surplus production .
the direct production and livelihood benefits to most smallholder farming households are clear .
however , the lower maize prices following the 2006 and 2007 harvests have likely improved food security for the urban poor and the vulnerable rural poor who remain net consuming households .
this result mirrors experience from asia 's green revolution .
notwithstanding the recent spike in world food prices , continuing surpluses will demand greater attention to price stabilization mechanisms , improved post - harvest management , and incentives to diversify beyond maize to higher returning crops , including perennials and non - farm enterprises .
future challenges : sustaining a green revolution in malawi unreliable rainfall and climate change. with almost all of its smallholder maize dependant on rainfall , malawi is particularly vulnerable to large season - to - season variation in production .
the returns on the fertilizer investment vary accordingly .
the realization of malawi 's green revolution and its contribution to economic growth is also threatened by climate change .
the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change highlighted the vulnerability of african agriculture and all who depend on it [ 37 ] .
agriculture in malawi may be affected by shorter growing seasons and higher temperatures .
the direct effects on agricultural production and food security will be exacerbated by greater exposure to malaria and other climate - influenced diseases that reduce labor productivity and employment opportunities .
malawian farmers have no alternative but to adapt to climate change .
fortunately , several practical options for adaptation to malawian conditions exist and need to be deployed as a matter of urgency [ 38 ] : water harvesting , sustainable extraction of groundwater , conservation farming ( reduced tillage , crop residue retention , and crop rotations ) , and improved water use efficiency in rainfed areas .
expanded irrigation through dams and extraction of water from lake malawi and the streams that feed it , subject to assessment of environmental impact .
shifts toward maize varieties with greater drought and heat tolerance , and improved pest and disease resistance , and corresponding adjustments in the national research agenda .
enterprise diversification toward higher value crops , value - adding , and off - farm employment that will generate income to buffer possible maize crop failures .
weather forecasting and provision of timely advice to farmers .
weather - related crop insurance .
a high priority of the government of malawi should be to design and implement a strategy to reduce rainfall - induced production variability and prepare farmers to adapt to climate change .
this strategy will require major public investments on a scale comparable to those that have supported the national input subsidy program .
high fertilizer prices .
fertilizer prices rose dramatically in 2007 and 2008 [ 39 ] , more than doubling the cost of the input subsidy program and leading to a projected budget shortfall of almost us $ 80 million .
this rise in fertilizer prices highlights the vulnerability of malawi to international market prices , a situation exacerbated by being landlocked. with high global food prices , the in - country production of maize by smallholders , even at three times the 2006 - 2007 cost of production , remains a more attractive and politically less risky proposition than international maize procurement and reliance on food aid .
while there is no immediate substitute for inorganic fertilizer , there may be scope to improve the efficiency of fertilizer use .
delayed access to seed and fertilizer is a recurring complaint of farmers in malawi and elsewhere in africa .
the timing of fertilizer application can be improved as delayed application can sharply reduce uptake efficiency .
this requires : early tendering , and contract signing by may each year ; coupons to be distributed by early august ; fertilizer and seed to be distributed by end of september ; and stocks in the field to be replenished ahead of timely application .
the national input subsidy program should focus on the use of urea ( 46 % nitrogen ) because of its lower unit cost of nitrogen than the compound fertilizer known as 23 - 21 - 0 ( which contains 23 % nitrogen and 21 % phosphorus ) .
at mid - 2008 prices , urea will cost 5 % less and provide 33 % more nitrogen than the current mix of urea and 23 - 21 - 0 .
as there are concerns about longer - term phosphorus deficiency in the absence of phosphorus application , this measure should be viewed as an interim solution only .
inclusion of grain legumes in crop rotations can bring multiple benefits to smallholders .
groundnut , soybean , beans , and pigeon pea are well adapted to different parts of malawi .
these crops provide cash income and improved nutrition in addition to providing up to 60 kg nitrogen / ha of residual fertilizer equivalent to the soil [ 40 ] .
a national crop legume promotion program is strongly recommended .
in the longer term , there is also scope to increase the contribution of nitrogen fixation through tree and shrub legumes .
there is a long history of research on agroforestry in malawi and neighboring countries in southern africa [ 41 ] .
availability of seed is often viewed as a constraint to adoption of agroforestry legumes in the region .
one option for encouraging adoption is to subsidize agroforestry legume seed .
another is to exploit the untapped potential for supporting more efficient small - scale nurseries and seed producers [ 42 ] .
post - harvest losses .
the surplus harvests in 2006 and 2007 have highlighted the need to improve post - harvest management of grain .
the most common cause of post - harvest losses in malawi is the larger grain borer ( prostephanus truncatus [ horn ]) , a storage pest that was introduced with food aid shipments [ 43 ] .
there are no reliable national estimates of the losses caused by this pest .
without chemical treatment , household - level losses of 40 % to 100 % have been reported .
losses from other insect pests and rats are also widespread .
such losses erode much of the estimated net gain from the input subsidy program .
the government recognized the importance and urgency of this problem by introducing post - harvest chemicals and distribution of improved storage bins in the 2008 - 2009 input subsidy program budget .
however , a much greater effort is needed to educate farmers on effective and safe storage techniques and to ensure that the needed chemicals and storage facilities are made available .
the way forward after decades of food insecurity and recurring emergencies , the government of malawi has successfully implemented a national input subsidy program that led to major surpluses above national demand in 2006 and 2007 .
drawing on their core resources - - land and labor - - and with a determination to be self - reliant and free of food aid , malawian smallholders demonstrated that they have the ability to respond to strategic material support and incentives in order to contribute to their own well - being .
notwithstanding pockets of yield reduction and crop failure due to floods and drought , malawi was blessed by two relatively favorable rainy seasons in 2005 - 2006 and 2006 - 2007 .
some critics consider that malawi was " lucky " in this respect .
yet , in rainfed agriculture , it is necessary to exploit better growing conditions when they arise .
continuity of this highly cost - effective program is needed in order for malawi to achieve its green revolution in a sustainable way .
solutions are still needed to address the risks of drought and dry spells , both through water management technologies and the spreading of financial risk .
improvements to fertilizer use efficiency and more targeted , locally refined recommendations need to be deployed .
agroforestry through the use of nitrogen - fixing trees is one of several options that can complement and ultimately reduce the need for inorganic nitrogen fertilizer .
post - harvest losses must be sharply reduced .
more generally , malawi ( and african countries like it ) will require a firm 10 - to 15 - year multi - stakeholder commitment to support rural economic transformation from sub - subsistence farmers into diversified , small - scale entrepreneurs , including major complementary investments in health , nutrition , education , family planning , infrastructure , water , and sanitation .
the input subsidy program must continue for several more years to meet the immediate needs for national and household food security , while longer - term investments in economic and social infrastructure are made .
any abrupt halt or downscaling of the subsidies , as was experienced by malawi following two years of implementation of the starter pack program [ 19,27 ] , would likely reverse the progress during the past three years and must be avoided .
however , with food security stabilized , input subsidies can be gradually decreased and replaced by smallholder - focused rural credit that played an important role in asia 's green revolution .
as in asia , price support through strategic government procurement may also be required to stabilize prices during times of bumper harvests .
the new malawi growth and development strategy [ 44 ] incorporates the fundamentals of this agriculture - led transformation and should be supported .
malawi has led the way in africa in demonstrating the opportunities and challenges of implementing a national input subsidy program. with the impetus of recent high food prices and a softening of donor opposition to subsidies , several of malawi 's neighbors ( including kenya , rwanda , and tanzania ) are now studying , adapting , and building on this experience to design and implement similar programs for improving agricultural productivity .
malawi 's experience will continue to provide valuable lessons for achieving and sustaining africa 's green revolution. funding .

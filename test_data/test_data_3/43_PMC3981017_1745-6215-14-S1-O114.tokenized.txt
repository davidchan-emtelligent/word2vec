individual surgeon skill and experience introduce an additional challenge to those of conventional rcts and as a consequence , surgeons may be reluctant to participate in orthopaedic surgery trials .
the use of expertise based randomised trials has been proposed as an alternative design , where participants are randomised to surgeons with an expertise in the allocated intervention .
topkat , a randomised controlled trial examining the clinical and cost effectiveness of total or partial knee replacements for medial compartment osteoarthritis utilised a combined expertise / equipoise based design in order to maximise surgeon participation and recruitment to the study .
the trial is on - going and has currently enrolled 460 / 500 ( 92 %) participants with recruitment due to end in september , 2013 .
overall , there are twenty eight participating sites , twenty one of which are equipoise and remaining seven expertise sites .
large variability in recruitment rates are seen across all sites with those participating as expertise sites demonstrating lower average monthly recruitment rates .
factors identified as additional challenges impacting recruitment rates and trial conduct to those of the equipoise sites include delays in establishing local expertise teams , patient preference for the recruiting surgeon , difficulties with patient logistics and timing of randomisation .
the topkat trial demonstrates that recruitment of orthopaedic surgeons to participate in and recruit to an expertise based design is both achievable and feasible .
we highlight the potential challenges and possible considerations that may facilitate the conduct of expertise based trials .

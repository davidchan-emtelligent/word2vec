individuals with psychopathy or autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) can behave in ways that suggest lack of empathy towards others .
however , many different cognitive and affective processes may lead to unempathic behavior and the social processing profiles of individuals with high psychopathic vs. asd traits are likely different .
whilst psychopathy appears characterized by problems with resonating with others' emotions , asd appears characterized by problems with cognitive perspective - taking .
in addition , alexithymia has previously been associated with both disorders , but the contribution of alexithymia needs further exploration .
in a community sample ( n = 110 ) we show for the first time that although affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking are related , high psychopathic traits relate to problems with resonating with others' emotions , but not cognitive perspective taking .
conversely , high asd traits relate to problems with cognitive perspective - taking but not resonating with others' emotions .
alexithymia was associated with problems with affective resonance independently of psychopathic traits , suggesting that different component processes ( reduced tendency to feel what others feel and reduced ability to identify and describe feelings ) comprise affective resonance .
alexithymia was not associated with the reduced cognitive perspective - taking in high asd traits .
our data suggest that ( 1 ) elevated psychopathic and asd traits are characterized by difficulties in different social information processing domains and ( 2 ) reduced affective resonance in individuals with elevated psychopathic traits and the reduced cognitive perspective taking in individuals with elevated asd traits are not explained by co - occurring alexithymia .
( 3 ) alexithymia is independently associated with reduced affective resonance .
consequently , our data point to different component processes within the construct of empathy that are suggestive of partially separable cognitive and neural systems .
psychopathy autism spectrum disorder alexithymia empathy affective resonance cognitive perspective - taking introduction empathy is the capacity to understand or resonate with the affective experiences of others ( singer and lamm , 2009 ) .
two important processes that contribute to empathy are ( i ) being aware of , and resonating with , the feelings of another individual such that the awareness of their emotion drives the same state in oneself ( henceforth affective resonance ) and ( ii ) identifying and understanding what another individual is thinking / feeling without a necessary affective response ( henceforth cognitive perspective - taking ) .
these processes may differentially characterize psychopathy and autism spectrum disorders ( asds ) .
although individuals with either disorder can behave in ways that suggest lack of empathy towards others' ( blair , 2005 ; jones et al. , 2010 ) this may be the result of problems in different social information processing domains .
psychopathy is a disorder characterized by a lack of empathy , shallow affect , and manipulation of others for own gain ( hare , 2003 ) .
difficulties with affective resonance are often apparent .
for example , individuals with psychopathy show reduced physiological response to others' distress ( blair et al. , 1997 ) .
adults with psychopathy and children with psychopathic traits display atypical neural responses to others' pain ( decety et al. , 2013 ; lockwood et al. , 2013 ; marsh et al. , 2013 ) .
in community samples , high levels of psychopathic traits are related to weaker affective responses to fearful faces and happy stories ( seara - cardoso et al. , 2012 , 2013 ) .
taken together , these findings indicate clear difficulties in resonating with others' emotions in both clinical samples with psychopathy and in community individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits .
in contrast , one of the defining features of psychopathy is the ability to successfully manipulate others ( hare , 2003 ) .
thus it might be expected that psychopathy would be associated with typical cognitive perspective - taking .
several studies report no cognitive perspective - taking impairments ( blair et al. , 1996 ; richell et al. , 2003 ; dolan and fullam , 2004 ; anastassiou - hadjicharalambous and warden , 2008 ) and even superior ability ( hansen et al. , 2008 ) in individuals with psychopathy or high psychopathic traits .
however , others have reported problems with tasks related to cognitive perspective - taking in both incarcerated psychopaths ( brook and kosson , 2013 ) and healthy samples with high psychopathic traits ( ali and chamorro - premuzic , 2010 ) .
one possibility for these mixed findings is that different paradigms vary in their level of affective content , with some purported cognitive perspective - taking measures requiring identification of other people 's feelings , rather than just their thoughts .
it could be that negative associations between psychopathic traits and cognitive perspective - taking are driven by problems related to basic affective processing , rather than difficulties in cognitive perspective - taking per se. in fact , all studies that have reported that psychopathy / psychopathic traits are associated with poorer cognitive perspective - taking have utilized measures with affective content ( e.g. , ali and chamorro - premuzic , 2010 ; brook and kosson , 2013 ) and therefore do not necessarily provide evidence for cognitive perspective - taking impairments in psychopathy .
autism spectrum disorders are characterized by problems with social interaction , communication , and repetitive behaviors .
asd are also associated with atypical empathic processing ( e.g. , baron - cohen and wheelwright , 2004 ) .
several decades of research indicates that individuals with asd have difficulties with cognitive perspective - taking ( see hill and frith , 2003 ) .
the findings from studies assessing processes related to affective resonance in asd are less consistent .
there is evidence of absent sensori - motor resonance when viewing others' pain in individuals with asd ( minio - paluello et al. , 2009 ) .
however , other studies have shown typical sensori - motor resonance when viewing others in pain ( fan et al. , 2013 ) and appropriate physiological responses to others distress ( blair , 1999 ) in individuals with asd .
when cognitive perspective - taking and empathic concern , a process related to affective resonance , have been compared in individuals with asd , impairments in cognitive perspective - taking but not empathic concern were found ( dziobek et al. , 2008 ) .
some theorists have argued that affective resonance is actually heightened in individuals with asd ( smith , 2009 ) and reports of greater empathic facial affect in children with asd compared to controls supports this ( capps et al. , 1993 ) .
a further consideration is the high comorbidity of asd with alexithymia .
alexithymia is a sub - clinical condition defined by an inability to identify and describe feelings in the self .
preliminary behavioral and neuroimaging research suggests that affective and empathy impairments in asd may be a function of interoceptive difficulties related to alexithymia rather than asd per se ( silani et al. , 2008 ; bird et al. , 2010 ) and that after accounting for alexithymia there is no difference in empathy between individuals with asd and controls ( bird and cook , 2013 ) .
however , one recent fmri study found no significant moderating effects of alexithymia in an empathy for pain task in individuals with asd ( fan et al. , 2013 ) .
nevertheless , the variance in alexithymia scores was very limited ( sd 3.8 in fan et al. , 2013 vs. 11.8 in bird et al. , 2010 ) , which may explain why no effect of alexithymia was observed .
less is known about the possible contribution of alexithymia to empathy impairments seen in individuals with psychopathy .
although the co - occurrence rates of alexithymia and psychopathy are lower than for asd ( louth et al. , 1998 ) , the two disorders do share some common attributes ( lander et al. , 2012 ) .
to date , only two studies have directly compared the profile of affective and cognitive processing related to psychopathy and asd , and these have both been in children .
children with conduct disorder and psychopathic traits showed less affective resonance with others' emotions but did not have problems with cognitive perspective - taking ; conversely , children with asd showed reduced cognitive perspective - taking but did not have problems with affective resonance ( jones et al. , 2010 ; schwenck et al. , 2012 ) .
however , no studies have directly contrasted psychopathic and asd traits and processes related to affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking in adults .
moreover , no studies have investigated the contribution of alexithymia to asd and psychopathic traits in tandem .
psychopathic , asd and alexithymic traits are present in varying degrees in the general population ( bagby et al. , 1994 ; baron - cohen et al. , 2001 ; hare and neumann , 2008 ) .
indeed , taxometric studies indicate that psychopathy should be viewed as a dimensional construct that is an extreme variant of normal personality and not a distinct category of behavior ( see hare and neumann , 2008 for review ) .
similarly , behavioral genetic studies indicate a similar etiology of autistic traits in the general population as well as in clinical groups ( robinson et al. , 2011 ) , thus providing an empirical basis for studying variants in traits associated with these disorders in the general population .
finally , investigating associations between these traits and potential differences in social information processing is one way to dissect the component processes that may contribute to empathy .
consequently , the present study investigated ( i ) whether psychopathic and asd traits were differentially related to performance on affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking tasks and ( ii ) whether alexithymia contributes to task performance .
we predicted that psychopathic traits would be negatively associated with performance on the affective resonance task but not the cognitive perspective - taking task and that asd traits would be negatively associated with performance on the cognitive perspective - taking task but not the affective resonance task .
alexithymia has previously been demonstrated to predict empathy deficits while recent neuroimaging results suggest cognitive perspective - taking is unlikely to be affected ( bernhardt et al. , 2013 ) .
therefore , we predicted that alexithymia would make a contribution to performance on the affective resonance task , but be unrelated to performance on the cognitive perspective - taking task .
we also explored whether the proposed association with alexithymia would reflect variance common to alexithymia and psychopathic traits , or variance unique to alexithymia .
materials and methods participants one hundred and ten healthy adults ( 50 % m ; 50 % f ) aged 18 - 33 ( m = 21.9 , sd = 3.7 ) with estimated iq between 87 and 129 ( m = 116.8 , sd = 8.4 ) took part .
participants were recruited through university participant databases and the community .
all participants provided written informed consent and the study had institutional ethics approval .
procedure participants completed two tasks to assess affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking as part of a larger battery of tasks .
all tasks were presented in a randomized order followed by the questionnaires .
experimental tasks theory of mind animations task ( cognitive perspective - taking task ) this task assessed participants' ability to understand others' complex mental states ( e.g. , tricking , coaxing ) and has been previously used to examine tom abilities in children with autism ( abell et al. , 2000 ) and healthy participants ( castelli et al. , 2002 ) .
we selected four " tom " and four " random " animations from abell et al .
( 2000 ) .
each animation featured two characters ; a big red and small blue triangle either interacting with one another ( tom animations ) or moving randomly ( random animations ) .
participants were asked to watch each animation carefully and to describe what was happening whilst their verbal responses were recorded .
two people transcribed the verbal descriptions that were coded in terms of intentionality and appropriateness .
the intentionality scale ranged from 0 ( no appreciation of another agent , nor actions or mental states ) to 5 ( the agent acts with the goal of affecting or manipulating the other agent 's mental states ) .
the appropriateness scale ranged from 0 to 3 .
one researcher rated all transcriptions and a second researcher rated a random sample of 56 .
intra - class correlations ( icc ) between raters for intentionality ( icc , single measures = 0.682 ) and appropriateness ( icc single measures = 0.760 ) were good .
the ratings of intentionality and appropriateness were converted to z - scores and a composite score was created .
self - assessment manikin faces task ( affective resonance task ) this task assessed participants' affective empathic response to emotional faces using the sam rating scale ( seara - cardoso et al. , 2012 ) .
participants were required to rate their own emotional response to the affective state of another on a nine - point manikin ( changing from smiling to a sad face with a neutral expression in the middle ) whilst viewing images depicting a person showing either a sad , fearful , angry , happy , or neutral expression .
the order of images was randomized for each participant .
ratings for sad , fear , and anger were reverse scored so that the higher scores reflected ratings of greater distress , and thus greater affective resonance , when viewing others' negative emotions .
these variables were then converted to z - scores and a composite score was created along with happy ratings .
questionnaires self - report psychopathy scale - short form ( srp - 4 - sf , paulhus et al. , in press ) psychopathic traits were assessed with the srp - 4 - sf , a 29 - item scale designed to measure psychopathic attributes in non - institutionalized samples .
the srp has been shown to have good construct validity and internal consistency ( cronbach 's alpha 0.89 in the present study ) and is strongly correlated with the pcl - r ; the clinical measure of psychopathy ( lilienfeld and fowler , 2006 ; paulhus et al. , in press ) .
questions were rated on a five - point scale from " disagree strongly " to " agree strongly " and included items such as " most people are wimps " and " i love violent sports and movies. " the autism spectrum quotient ( aq , baron - cohen et al. , 2001 ) autism spectrum disorder traits were assessed with the aq , a 50 - item scale designed to assess asd traits in both clinical and community samples .
the aq has good construct validity and internal consistency ( cronbach 's alpha 0.83 in the present study ) .
questions were rated on a four - point scale from " definitely disagree " to " definitely agree " and included items such as " i enjoy meeting new people " and " i would rather go to a library than a party. " toronto alexithymia scale ( tas , bagby et al. , 1994 ) alexithymic traits were assessed with the tas , a 20 - item scale designed to measure subclinical alexithymic traits .
questions were rated on a five - point scale from " i strongly disagree " to " i strongly agree " and included items such as " i am often confused about what emotion i am feeling " and " i am often puzzled by sensations in my body. " the tas has good construct validity and internal consistency ( cronbach 's alpha 0.82 in the present study ) .
results performance on the affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking tasks was positively correlated ( r = 0.40 , p < 0.001 ) .
all questionnaire measures were also positively correlated with one another ( see table 1 ) .
first , bivariate correlations were examined to assess whether psychopathic and asd traits were differentially related to affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking .
as predicted psychopathic traits showed a statistically significant negative correlation with performance on the affective resonance task ( r = - 0.258 , p = 0.007 ) whilst asd traits did not ( r = - 0.102 , p = 0.291 ) .
conversely , asd traits showed a statistically significant negative correlation with performance on the cognitive perspective - taking task ( r = - 0.209 , p = 0.028 ) whilst psychopathic traits did not ( r = - 0.046 , p = 0.634 ) .

we conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses to investigate whether psychopathic and asd traits were uniquely and differentially related to affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking , and to examine whether individual differences in alexithymia and / or iq might explain any associations ( see table 2 ) .
two models were run .
for the model predicting performance on the affective resonance task , psychopathic traits were entered at the first stage .
psychopathic traits significantly predicted reduced affective resonance ( p = 0.007 ) .
at the second stage asd traits were entered .
psychopathic traits were uniquely negatively associated with affective resonance ( t = - 2.57 , p = 0.011 ) whilst asd traits were not ( t = - 0.43 , p = 0.669 ) .
the r2 change was not significant ( f change = 0.18 , p = 0.669 ) indicating that asd traits did not significantly explain more variance in the model .
at the third stage , alexithymia scores were entered .
controlling for alexithymia did not change the pattern of results , but there was a unique negative association between alexithymia and affective resonance ( t = - 1.99 , p = 0.049 ) , and the r2 change was significant ( f = 3.96 , p = 0.049 ) .
at the fourth stage iq scores were entered .
controlling for iq did not change the pattern of results , nor was iq a significant predictor of affective resonance ( p = 0.73 ) .
the same regression sequence was then used for cognitive perspective - taking , but with asd traits at the first stage and psychopathic traits at the second .
asd traits were significantly negatively associated with cognitive perspective - taking ( t = - 2.22 , p = 0.028 ) .
at the second stage psychopathic traits were entered .
asd traits were uniquely negatively associated with reduced cognitive perspective taking ( t = - 2.16 , p = 0.033 ) whilst psychopathic traits were not ( t = 0.06 , p = 0.956 ) .
the r2 change was not significant ( f change = 0.00 , p = 0.956 ) indicating that psychopathic traits did not explain significantly more variance in the model .
taking into account alexithymia and iq did not change the pattern of results , nor did either of these variables predict cognitive perspective - taking .
no further r2 changes were significant ( all f 's < 1.24 , all ps > 0.26 ) .

discussion the current study compared associations between psychopathic or asd traits and tasks assessing affective resonance or cognitive perspective - taking .
we demonstrated unique associations between psychopathic traits and reduced affective resonance but not cognitive perspective - taking , and unique associations between asd traits and reduced cognitive perspective - taking but not affective resonance .
alexithymic traits did not explain observed associations between task performance and psychopathic or asd traits but rather contributed to performance on the affective resonance task independently of psychopathic traits .
this is the first study in healthy adults to show a differential relationship between these variables .
thus , it extends previous findings that have reported contrasting profiles of empathy impairments between children with psychopathic tendencies or asd ( jones et al. , 2010 ; schwenck et al. , 2012 ) .
our results also suggest that although affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking measures share some variance , they can capture dissociable processes .
psychopathy is thought to be characterized by problems with affective resonance but not cognitive perspective - taking .
we used measures that were designed to specifically probe affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking , without there being cognitive perspective - taking demands on the affective resonance task or vice versa .
our results therefore extend and clarify the findings of previous studies reporting reduced affective resonance in individuals high in psychopathic traits ( seara - cardoso et al. , 2012 , 2013 ) by indicating a reduction in affective resonance in the absence of a reduction in cognitive perspective - taking .
these data also highlight how high psychopathic traits are not related to atypical cognitive perspective - taking processing when a task without an affective component is used .
autism spectrum disorders have been consistently linked to problems with cognitive perspective - taking ( hill and frith , 2003 ) .
interestingly , we found that elevated asd traits in the general population were also associated with atypical cognitive perspective - taking .
in contrast , findings of tasks related to affective resonance processing in autism are mixed , with reduced ( minio - paluello et al. , 2009 ) , intact ( blair , 1999 ; dziobek et al. , 2008 ; bird et al. , 2010 ; fan et al. , 2013 ) , and elevated ( capps et al. , 1993 ) levels of affective processing being reported .
our findings suggest that asd traits are not associated with either a reduced or an enhanced ability to resonate with the emotions of another , despite the fact that high levels of asd traits are related to difficulties with understanding others' minds .
it would be useful for future studies to assess multiple forms of processing related to affective resonance , as the paradigms used in some studies that reported intact affective resonance investigated empathic concern , rather than affective resonance .
examining both of these processes in tandem may help to shed further light on the profile of empathic processing in asd .
moreover , it would also be interesting to further examine the exact cognitive perspective - taking mechanisms that may be disrupted in relation to asd / high asd traits .
it could be that some disrupted components of cognitive perspective - taking relate to bottom - up processes such as detection of biological movement , whereas others might relate to top - down processes such as the influence of situational cues .
both psychopathy and asd have previously been associated with elevated levels of alexithymia ( louth et al. , 1998 ; lander et al. , 2012 ; bird and cook , 2013 ) , and we also observed modest correlations between psychopathic and asd traits with alexithymia in the present study .
nevertheless , controlling for alexithymic traits did not change the reported associations between psychopathic traits and reduced affective resonance or asd traits and reduced cognitive perspective - taking .
in other words , the reduced ability to identify and describe feelings in the self did not account for the relationship between psychopathic traits and affective resonance or asd traits and cognitive perspective - taking .
the finding that alexithymia did not explain the reduced cognitive perspective - taking abilities characteristic of asd traits is of particular interest given recent evidence and theory suggesting that alexithymia does account for affective processing deficits related to autism , when they are observed ( bird and cook , 2013 ) .
our data extend this account by showing that alexithymia does not appear to explain reduced cognitive perspective - taking related to high asd traits .
we also found that alexithymic traits were negatively associated with a reduction in affective resonance independently of psychopathic traits .
this suggests that reductions in affective resonance can be affected both by reduced ability to identify and describe feelings ( a characteristic of alexithymia ) and a reduced tendency to feel what others feel ( a characteristic of psychopathy ) .
the result of independence between psychopathic and alexithymic traits in predicting performance on affective resonance also points to potential component processes within the construct of affective resonance .
future studies could help to determine the mechanisms underlying reduced affective resonance in psychopathy and alexithymia .
a few limitations to the present study should be highlighted .
in everyday life empathic responses to others occur in the context of reciprocal social interactions , the present tasks did not present such scenarios in the interest of isolating affective resonance and cognitive perspective - taking demands .
although we chose paradigms to specifically examine two process that contribute to the experience of empathy , these are not exhaustive and further research would benefit from examining a larger collection of tasks that tap a multitude of processes related to empathy .
it will also be of interest to determine whether the processing atypicalities associated with psychopathic , asd , and alexithymia traits explain real life observations of unempathic behavior , as rated by others or observed in an experimental setting .
finally , replication of these results with clinical populations would be informative .
overall , our findings clarify and extend previous studies examining the profiles of empathy deficits related to psychopathy , asd , and alexithymia .
we show for the first time that in subclinical samples elevated psychopathic traits are related to reduced affective resonance but not cognitive perspective - taking whilst elevated levels of asd traits are related to reduced cognitive perspective - taking but not affective resonance .
consequently , our data point to different social information processes within the construct of empathy that are suggestive of partially separable cognitive and neural systems .

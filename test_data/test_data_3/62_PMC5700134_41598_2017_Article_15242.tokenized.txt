the centipede scolopendra has important medicinal value and high toxicity , making it to be an interesting subject for evolutionary studies .
however , species identification in china is difficult because of limited resource exploration and lack of recent taxonomic revision .
to improve the identification and taxonomy of the genus scolopendra in china , an in - depth investigation was conducted , and an integrated method that combined morphological characteristics with molecular data was applied .
the identification key was revised to show the main difference among species .
our results indicated that morphologically - delimited species were consistent with the molecular analysis inferred from the coi sequences with genetic distances and phylogenetic trees .
additional morphometrics of four characteristics provided criteria for shape variation .
these results suggested that the members of the genus scolopendra in china could be delineated as 14 separate species .
a new species from lufeng county , yunnan province , was proposed according to its characteristics , which was named as s. lufengia sp. nov .
our results comprehensively ascertained the taxonomic status of scolopendra species in china , explored their phylogenetic relationships , showed a high success in the identification of medicinal centipedes .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction the genus scolopendra , which belongs to the family scolopendridae of the order scolopendromorpha , is widely distributed across the world , especially in tropical and subtropical territories , such as southeast asia1,2 , north africa3 , the mediterranean4 , and north or central america5,6 .
as an ancient biological population , scolopendra is an important branch of terrestrial arthropods in the evolutionary process .
furthermore , populations of many species in scolopendra live in a relatively fixed geographical distribution area due to its weak ability to migrate , so scolopendra has become an important research material for historical biogeography .
reports showed that there were 42 nominal species of scolopendra distributed in the old world7 .
in the tropical and subtropical areas of southern china , there should be an abundant resource of centipedes8 .
however , resource surveys of the genus scolopendra have rarely been conducted in china .
sporadic evidence has shown that there are 13 species of scolopendra scattered in southern china8,9 , but the exact species and details of their distribution are still uncertain , and it needs to be revised .
as is well known , centipedes are poisonous , and their venom is highly toxic to vertebrates including humans , which can cause intense pain and edema , sometimes paralysis or even death10 .
however , knowledge about centipede toxicity is still limited .
in recent years , studies have targeted the potential therapeutic effects of the toxin11,12 .
after being extracted from centipede venom , a selective nav1.7 inhibitor was discovered to have analgesic efficacy exceeding that of morphine in rodent pain models13 .
a cytotoxic and anticoagulant peptide was also found in s. mutilans venom14 .
in some asian countries , such as china , some species are even used for antitumoral purposes15 or to improve blood rheology16 .
however , it is reported that patients have shown myocardial ischemia due to vasospasm , hypotension , and myocardial toxic effects of the venom17 .
the results of fang 's study indicated that the histamine content of s. mutilans was higher than that of s. multidens and s. mojiangica 18 , suggesting that the toxicity of centipedes varies considerably between species .
in china , s. mutilans l. koch , 1878 , as the dominant and most widespread species , is the only species recorded in chinese pharmacopoeia as medicinal material19 .
the shape similarity between scolopendra species often causes confusion or misuse , which can pose a large risk to human health as mentioned above .
therefore , it is crucial to improve the accuracy of identification and taxonomy of scolopendra species .
as a universal taxonomic method , morphological characteristics , such as the body size , colour , number of antennal articles , spines on ultimate legs prefemur and tarsal spur on legs , etc. , are used in the classification and identification of the genus scolopendra .
however , if some species show close relationships or similar characteristics , or some features are missed , it can be challenging to identify these arthropods or obtain a better taxonomic result .
to date , the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of scolopendra are still controversial , and the validation of the former subspecies of the s. subspinipes complex and the s. morsitans complex has been debated repeatedly , resulting in their undetermined status9,20 .
therefore , a simple and accurate method to authenticate the species in the genus scolopendra is urgently needed .
the use of morphometrics provides a new pathway for the demarcation of morphological characteristics .
the species in southeast asia were identified by applying geometric morphometrics data2 .
this method involves the digitization of certain subjective features ; thus , the results are more objective and accurate because this method is based on statistical analysis , the potential for human error was prevented as far as possible .
however , to have sufficient accuracy , the sampling size should be large enough because a small number of samples or overlapping characteristics could result in confusion .
the emergence of molecular phylogeny has led to its use as a powerful supplementary tool in evolutionary studies , as well as biological and medicinal material investigations21 - 23 .
based on molecular techniques , the taxonomy and evolutionary history of many organisms have been revised .
currently , coi barcoding technology is the most popular method for the identification of animal species , and it has been widely used on fish24,25 , birds26 and insects27,28 , as well as centipedes2 .
for instance , the centipede genus eupolybothrus of north africa had been systematically studied by this method , and a new species , e. kahfi stoev & akkari , had been discovered29 .
recently , the integrative methods of morphology combined with dna data or other analysis were used in the taxonomy of centipedes .
joshi et al. used molecular data to identify putative species , and then they applied morphology and ecological niche analysis to reveal the diversity in the western ghats of south india30 .
an integrative method including molecular phylogenetics , geometric morphometrics and external morphology was used to delimit seven scolopendra species in mainland southeast asia , the former subspecies of s. dawydoffi , s. japonica , and s. dehaani were validated as full species2 .
in the studies of the genus scolopendra in china , in light of preliminary identification of morphology , zhang31 demarcated s. mutilans from four other species using coi barcoding .
however , the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of these species or subspecies still need to be studied further .
in this study , based on an in - depth survey of scolopendra species in the south of china8 , an integrated method combining morphology with molecular analysis was used to identify and distinguish the species of scolopendra in china .
the type materials of some species had been re - described , and morphometric analysis of four critical characteristics were conducted , then an identification key was made .
the molecular analysis of coi barcoding was used for further validation of the morphological taxonomy .
furthermore , the taxonomic status of these species and relationships among them were also validated .
the works will be instrumental in solving problems related to some centipede species being confused and misused in china .
results morphological identification as described in the methods section , 39 batch samples were observed .
the characteristics , i.e , number of antennal articles , presence of gonopods , tarsal spurs on 20th leg and spines on the ultimate leg prefemur , had been identified , and the subtle features were inspected by light microscopy .
the diagnostic characteristics of these assigned species are recorded in table 1 .
all samples examined had common characteristics of the genus scolopendra .
based on morphological characteristics , the examined samples were divided into seven nominal species and one putative new species .
the seven species are as follows : s. mutilans , s. multidens , s. dehaani , s. mojiangica , s. negrocapitis , s. subspinipes and s. hainanum .
the specimens collected from lufeng county , yunnan province , have some characteristics different from others , the details are as follow : table 1 characteristics of all examined species based on external morphology of voucher specimens .

previously , researchers had mainly focused on the medicinal use of the centipedes , and some incomplete keys for these species in china were used for identification8,32 .
however , there were still many species which were not included in the keys .
in this study , the morphological characteristics of 8 collected species were examined .
in combination with records of 6 other species in china , i.e. , s. japonica , s. morsitans , s. amazonica , s. mazbii , s. calcarata and s. diaoluoensis 33 , we were able to systematically revise the identification key for the scolopendra species in china .

the length and width of four parts that were measured in previous morphometric studies of scolopendra 2,9 , including the body , cephalic plate , tergite 21 and ultimate leg prefemur , were likewise measured in our study .
the body length and the length - width ratios of the cephalic plate , tergite 21 , and prefemur of ultimate leg were obtained .
the shape variation was analyzed using the kruskal - wallis test in spss statistics version 23 .
the results are given in fig. 2. based on the statistical results , there are significant differences among groups of the four characteristics for p < 0.05 on the whole .

( b ) the cephalic plate l / w ratio of species .
( c ) the tergite 21 l / w ratio of species .
( d ) the ultimate leg prefemur l / w ratio of species .
body length the length ranges from 4.80 cm to 23.80 cm , the total mean is 13.36 cm , and the mean for each species is 16.64 , 14.50 , 7.96 , 9.66 , 14.52 , 13.95 , 14.04 and 4.85 cm respectively ( see fig. 2a ) .
there are significant differences between s. mojiangica and the other four species of s. multidens , s. mutilans , s. dehaani and s. subspinipes ( p = 0.000 to 0.025 , p < 0.05 ) ; s. mutilans has significant difference from s. multidens and s. negrocapitis ( p = 0.003 to 0.035 , p < 0.05 ) ; and s. multidens has significant difference from s. negrocapitis and s. lufengia ( p = 0.000 to 0.005 , p < 0.05 ) .
other species have no significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) .
according to the means of the measured data , the species can be divided into two groups , namely , large - or small - size species .
the large - size group mainly contains s. multidens , s. dehaani , s. hainanum and s. subspinipes .
their mean lengths are more than the total mean of 13.36 cm. the small - size group includes s. mojiangica , s. negrocapitis and s. lufengia , and their mean lengths are less than 13.36 cm. although the measured mean length of s. mutilans is more than 13.36 cm , its length is usually between 10 and 13 cm , for few individuals are longer than 13 cm , thus s. mutilans is treated as a small - size species .
l / w ratio of cephalic plate the length - width ratio of the cephalic plate ranges from 0.87 to 1.51 .
there is significant difference between s. dehaani and s. mutilans or s. negrocapitis ( p = 0.000 to 0.006 , p < 0.05 ) , and between s. mutilans and s. mojiangica ( p = 0.000 , p < 0.05 ) .
however , there is no significant difference among the others ( p > 0.05 ) ( see fig. 2b ) .
l / w ratio of tergite 21 the tergite 21 length - width ratios range from 0.63 to 1.40. s. mutilans is significantly different from s. mojiangica , s. multidens and s. lufengia ( p = 0.000 to 0.050 , p < 0.05 ) ; s. dehaani is significantly different from s. multidens , s. mojiangica and s. lufengia ( p = 0.001 to 0.047 , p < 0.05 ) .
other species do not show significant difference ( see fig. 2c ) .
l / w ratio of prefemur of ultimate leg the prefemur of ultimate leg length - width ratios of these species range from 1.75 to 4.37 .
there is significant difference between s. mojiangica and other five species of s. multidens , s. dehaani , s. mutilans , s. subspinipes and s. hainanum ( p = 0.000 to 0.019 , p < 0.05 ) ; s. negrocapitis has significant difference from four species of s. dehaani , s. mutilans , s. subspinipes and s. hainanum ( p = 0.000 to 0.044 , p < 0.05 ) ; s. lufengia aslo shows significant difference from s. subspinipes and s. hainanum ( p = 0.001 to 0.008 , p < 0.05 ). s. mutilans has significant difference with s. subspinipes ( p = 0.006 , p < 0.05 ) .
there is no significant difference among the others ( p > 0.05 ) .
as the l / w ratios are showed in fig. 2d , s. lufengia and s. mojiangica have a stubby ultimate leg prefemur , their l / w ratios are about two , and those of s. multidens , s. mutilans and s. dehaani are three , whereas s. subspinipes and s. hainanum have slender ultimate legs , for their l / w ratios are approximate four .
molecular analysis sequence annotation a total of 59 raw nucleotide sequences from partial gene targets for coi , representing 8 nominal species , were successfully amplified and sequenced .
all raw sequences were verified with other available scolopendromorph sequences in genbank using the blastn algorithm .
the results showed that all the sequences belonged to the homologous sequences of the genus scolopendra , and the outgroup contamination did not affect the genomic dna .
the final aligned sequences obtained by sequence editing and the alignment program consisted of 647 bp. the g + c content is 29.9 % ~ 38.0 % .
the contents of a + t are obviously higher than those of g + c. the average percentages of the g + c content of species are given in table 3 .
the sequences of coi gene fragments consists of 327 variable sites and 320 conservative sites .
corrected genetic distances were calculated by the kimura - 2 - parameter ( k2p ) model for dna sequence alignment .
the intraspecific maximum k2p distance is 0.000 to 0.129 , and the interspecific minimum k2p distance is 0.000 to 0.187 .
the intraspecific maximum distance of each species is less than the interspecific minimum distance .

two optimality criteria of neighbor - joining ( nj ) and maximum likelihood ( ml ) were applied for analysis .
in the nj tree , the members of scolopendra are divided into two groups ( see fig. 3 : clade a and clade b ) .
the first group ( clade a ) is subdivided into two clades ( clade c and clade d ) .
clade c is further divided into clade e and clade f. clade e is mainly composed of s. mutilans , s. amazonica , s. morsitans and s. dehaani , whereas clade f includes s. subspinipes and s. hainanum .
clade d is further divided into clade g and clade h. clade g is a single branch of s. lufengia sp. nov. , whereas clade h consists of s. multidens , s. japonica , s. negrocapitis and s. mojinagica .
the other group , clade b , is the species s. calcarata .
in the topological structure , 10 morphological species of the genus scolopendra are clustered into separate branches , and the taxonomy is supported by molecular data .
the other two species , s. subspinipes and s. hainanum , are clustered into one branch together .
they could not be differentiated from one another , and these were inconsistent with the morphological taxonomy9 .
in the ml tree , the structure shows separated groups ( see fig. 4 ) , except s. subspinipes and s. hainanum overlaps with two sequences of s. mutilans and one sequence of s. multidens which may be suspicious sequences .
the groups of s. amazonica , s. morsitans , s. subspinipes and s. hainanum are divided into different clades compared to the nj tree .
the putative species of s. lufengia sp. nov. is still a separate branch .

discussion scolopendromorpha are widely distributed in the world , especially in tropical and subtropical territories .
as the southern china is one of the world 's biodiversity hotspots , there is an abundance of biological species , including centipedes8 .
however , comprehensive investigations of the genus scolopendra in china have seldom been carried out , and the exact species and distribution range are still unknown .
in our survey of many regions of china , we found that the animals of scolopendromorpha are widely distributed across the country , but the species of the genus scolopendra are mainly confined to the southern region of the qinling - huaihe isotherm ( which is also the boundary between north and south china ) .
each species lives in relatively fixed distribution areas and under suitable geographical climate conditions8 .
in recent years , many new species had been found in china , such as s. negrocapitis and s. mojiangica 34,35 .
many former subspecies , i.e , s. multidens , s. dehaani and s. japonica , were also elevated as valid species8,9,32 .
although there are obviously differences in morphological characteristics between s. mutilans and s. subspinipes , siriwut1 failed to distinguish these two species in the phylogenetic tree .
however , in our study , they clustered into two different branches in the tree , and the result is consistent with report of vahtera36 , which supports the status of separate species .
previously , s. subspinipes was considered to be a variable species widely distributed in the southern area , kronmuller9 explored the differences among individuals in morphology , and then s. hainanum was separated from s. subspinipes as a new species .
nevertheless , these two morph - species are not supported by our molecular information and morphometric data .
the samples collected from lufeng , yunnan , have specific morphological characteristics as described above , which are obviously different from those of other species in china .
the morphometric data show that this species has a small body length and strong ultimate leg prefemur with a ratio of approximately twice the length to width .
the molecular analysis also indicates its independent taxa status , which is resolved as a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree .
its geographic distribution is near to that of s. mojiangica , but it is obviously different from s. mojiangica in both morphology and molecular features .
as a result , we assumed it to be a new species and named it s. lufengia sp. nov .
according to our description and sporadic reports8,32 - 34 , to date , there are 14 species of scolopendra distributed in china .
previously , morphological examination was the main approach applied for taxonomy of the genus scolopendra .
however , there is much debate around the taxonomic status of some species , especially in terms of the taxonomy of the former s. subspinipes complex and s. morsitans complex .
in our study , an integrated method of morphology - molecular analysis has been used to validate the taxonomy .
based on the morphological identification , the characteristics of the collected samples were redescribed .
combined with previous reports , the identification key was revised to show the main differences among scolopendra species in china .
the morphometric analysis made the subjective characteristics digitized and more intuitive , which further highlighted the morphological variations among species , especially in the body length and the prefemur of ultimate leg .
the coi barcoding both in nj and ml analyses further confirmed the determination , and it provided a new approach to solve these difficulties in identification by using the genetic distance and phylogenetic trees , from which 10 of the 12 putative species were successfully classified .
there are deficiencies in identifying damaged or powder samples by morphological methods , difficulties also existed in classifying species that are closely related using molecular methods , but the integrated approach can make these two methods complement each other , which showed good results in our identification of the scolopendra species .
in this way , we believe that the integrated approach gives evidence for the validation of the scolopendra species in china to be separate species ; thus , the former subspecies of s. subspinipes and s. morsitans in china are reasonably valid species .
the morphological characteristics of s. lufengia do not match those of other scolopendra species , and it can also be confirmed by molecular data to be separate taxon .
in contrast , the characteristics of s. hainanum match the description given by kronmuller9 ( see table 1 ) .
however , the molecular data suggests that there is no obvious difference between s. hainanum and s. subspinipes in either the genetic distance or the phylogenetic tree , so these two morph - species would be considered one molecular - species for clustering into a single branch on the tree .
we speculate that there would be a close relationship between these species , and that the unapparent differences of genetic distance in coi gene fragments from our limited samples and data from the same collected area of pubei , guangxi ( fig. 5e ) would not be sufficient to be reflected on the tree .
thus , we consider the taxonomic status of s. hainanum to be still undetermined , and taxonomy for these two morph - species still warrants further study .
in our study , the genetic relationships among most species are consistant in the nj and ml trees , but the species of s. amazonica , s. morsitans , s. subspinipes and s. hainanum are clustered into different clades .
figure 5 phylogenetic relationship of the genus scolopendra based on genetic structure among its populations relative to regional distribution in china .
( a ) the population of s. mutilans from hubei and adjacent areas gathered into a branch while samples from zhejiang clustered into another branch in the structure .
( b ) the genetic structure of s. dehaani indicates that its populations sampled from guangxi and yunnan gathered into a different branch .
( c ) the population of s. multidens sampled from yulin and pubei of guangxi gathered into a different branch .
( d ) significant difference of s. negrocapitis in the phylogenetic tree caused by distribution .
( e ) the two species of s. subspinipes and s. hainanum cluster into a single branch which shows no genetic difference .
meanwhile , although the medical value of scolopendra has gradually been recognized , the high risk of toxicity to humans is an inevitable topic17,37 .
because there is difference in the toxicity and pharmacological effect between species18 , accurately identifying scolopendra species will help to reduce the risk , and their medicinal properties would be fully utilized .
in this study , the authenticity of the scolopendra species in china can be verified using the integrated method of morphology identification and coi barcoding , and s. mutilans can be distinguished accurately from the local medicinal species or other commonly confused species in markets .
in morphological examination , characteristics are usually used to evaluate identification and taxonomy .
however , in fact , the importance of the characteristics in evaluation are not always equivalent , because there are flexible features , such as coloration which is one of the most variable characteristics .
usually the species are divided into monochromatic or dichromatic pattern according to the color of cephalic plate and tergites .
most individuals of s. dehaani have a monochromatic pattern for the brown body , but some of them also have reddish cephalic plates and brown or entirely black tergites , comprising a dichromatic pattern .
even the same color pattern maybe displays difference. s. subspinipes has a monochromatic pattern , and the coloration has a large range , which varies from reddish brown to blackish .
the yellow legs of s. mutilans from hubei province and the red legs from zhejiang province are another obvious example in coloration .
in immature stages or at ecdysis , the color is also relatively duller than in adults .
the margination or paramedian suture on tergites and sternites is another unstable characteristic.the first tergite with suture or margination is occasionally inconspicuous in individuals , and can overlap with other related species .
abnormal structures will also cause errors in identification and taxonomy .
sometimes smaller or special regenerations are found in a damaged leg or antenna , which are obviously different from the protogenetic legs or antennae .
thus , it is not sufficient to differentiate species just based on these variable characteristics .
however , some stable and specific features should be chosed as diagnostic characteristics .
for example , s. mutilans has tarsal spurs on 20 legs , whereas the 20 legs of s. multidens lack tarsal spurs ; the gonopods of s. multidens and s. hainanun are not visible ; and ventral lateral spines are lacking on the ultimate leg prefemur of s. dehaani .
in our morphometric study , four features are used to show the shape variation .
in light of the body length and the length - width ratio of the ultimate leg prefemur , the samples can be easily divided to different types .
hence , we supposed that these critical and stable characteristics , including antennae , gonopods , tarsal spurs on 20th leg and spines on the ultimate leg prefemur , as well as the length and length - width ratio of the ultimate leg prefemur ( see table 1 and fig. 2 ) , should be regarded as important taxonomical characteristics , which would play a very important role in identification and taxonomy .
reports have shown that some scolopendra species have different patterns , in either external morphology or genetic materials , that are caused by their geographic environments. s. dehaani in southeast asia has five color patterns , and they are clustered into five small branches in the phylogenetic tree2 .
in our study , we found that the color of the legs in most individuals of s. mutilans was yellow in hubei province , but red in zhejiang province .
in the phylogenetic tree , samples of s. mutilans from hubei and the adjacent areas of henan and anhui are all clustered into one branch , whereas samples from zhejiang are united into another branch ( fig. 5a ) .
these conditions caused by distribution also exist in s. multidens and s. negrocapitis .
the samples of s. multidens collected from yulin and pubei are clustered into separate branches ( fig. 5c ) , and samples of s. negrocapitis collected from suizhou of hubei and chaohu of anhui are also clustered into two separate branches ( fig. 5d ). s. dehaani collected from yunnan and guangxi further confirmed these patterns ( fig. 5b ) .
we consider that the geographical and ecological environments , such as mountains or plains , temperature and humidity , etc , might play an important role in difference of morphology or genetic material .
in our study , although as many as 39 batches of samples were collected , there are still limitations .
first , it is difficult to obtain enough samples from all regions , some species can not be collected successfully , or the sample size of some species is small ( e.g. , only two specimen of s. lufengia were collected ) .
in addition , certain samples were of poor quality after being stored for a long time , so their sequences could not be extracted during our molecular analysis .
these factors may lead to uncertainty in the results .
in future , further investigations and more representative samples would be needed to perfect the result and bring more accuracy to the identification and taxonomy of scolopendra in china , especially in the putative species of s. lufengia .
but this integrated method of morphology - molecular analysis would also provide a reference for the study of other species and medicinal materials .
materials and methods sample materials a total of 39 batch samples were collected from the natural field during the course of surveys in southern china , commodity markets or companies since 2015 .
the sample information is given in table 5 .
the living specimens were relaxed with 50 % ethanol for 10 ~ 20 min and then transferred into 70 % ethanol to settle their posture for photography .
the samples for molecular analysis were kept in absolute ethanol at - 40 degreesc .
the others were kept in conditions below - 20 degreesc .

a series of diagnostic characteristics was involved in the identification , and the details shown as follow , coloration , shape size , number of antennal articles , and those that are sparsely hirsute or glabrous , number of teeth , spines on the coxopleuron , prefemur spines arrangement on the ultimate legs , presence or absence of tarsal spurs on legs 19 and 20 , and presence or absence of a gonopod on the first genital segment of the male .
the photos were taken with a nikon d7000 digital camera assembled with a nikonlens , and the fine features were observed using an olympus optical stereomicroscope equipped with an imaging system ( olympus , japan ) .
all samples were classified into nominal species , and the identification key of species in china was revised .
additional morphometrics the representative specimens were chosen randomly from the samples of nominal species to avoid personal bias .
in light of previous literatures , some characteristics have important value in identification and taxonomy2,9 .
the typical morphological features of four parts , including the body , cephalic plate , tergite 21 and ultimate leg prefemur , were chosed for this analysis .
the length and width of these four parts were measured with a vernier caliper ; and the length - width ratios of the cephalic plate , tergite 21 and ultimate leg prefemur were calculated .
the data was analyzed using the spss statistics version 23 software .
the kruskal - wallis test was used to determine significant difference .
a p value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance .
dna extraction , amplification and sequencing 40mg separated tissue from the locomotory legs of samples was disinfected with 75 % ethanol and then dissected .
the blood / cell / tissue tianamp genomic dna kit ( tiangen biotech co. , china ) was applied to extract total dna according to the instructions .
the pcr mixture consisted of the following : 2.0 mul of dna template , 1.0 mul of forward and reverse primers , 12.5 mul of 2xtaq pcr mix and 8.5 mul of ddh2o .
coi gene fragments were chosen for detection , and the universal primer sequences used were 5 ' - ggtcaacaaatcataaagatattgg - 3 ' ( lco1490 , forward ) and 5 ' - taaacttcagggtgaccaaaaaatca - 3 ' ( hco2198 , reverse ) 39 .
all pcr mixtures were activated using a pcr analyzer ( prime 5g , techne british co. ) .
the coi gene amplification was performed under conditions of pcr reactions cycled at 94 degreesc for 1 min as an initial step , followed by 5 cycles of 94 degreesc for 1 min in a denaturation step , 45 degreesc for 1.5 min in an annealing step , and 72 degreesc for 1.5 min in an extension step .
this process was followed by 35 cycles of 94 degreesc for 1 min in the denaturation step , an annealing step at 50 degreesc for 1.5 min , 72 degreesc for 1 min in an extension step , and then a final extension step at 72 degreesc for 5 min .
the pcr cycler was programmed at a holding temperature of 4 degreesc as the final step .
the pcr products were detected on 1 % ( w / v ) agarose gel electrophoresis in a 0.5xtbe buffer .
the fluorescence of pcr bands were enhanced with sybr safe illuminant and observed under uv light .
the pcr products were directly cycle - sequenced using the sanger method and original amplification primers at sangon biotech ( wuhan ) co. , ltd .
phylogenetic reconstruction dna sequences were assembled in codoncode aligner v5.1.5 ( codoncode co. , usa ) .
double strand sequence comparisons were made using a shadow pairwise alignment function analysis to detect missing sites and gaps in nucleotide sequences based on the chromatograms for each sequence sample .
the sequences ( including the sequences from 8 collected species and 4 species from genbank ; 8 sequences of s. mutilans , s. dehaani and s. multidens were also from genbank ) were used to construct the phylogenetic tree .
moreover , two sequences of the scolopendrid subfamily otostigminae from genbank , otostigmus scaber porat , 1876 and rhysida longicornis pocock , 1891 were chosen as outgroup to root the trees .
all of the final sequences were blasted in genbank with the homologous sequences as a check to evaluate the efficiency and then submitted to genbank .
a summary of the sequences information is in table 5 .
the dna sequences were aligned using muscle , and the genetic distances were computed using mega 6.06 according to the k2p model .
the nj and ml analysis were applied to construct phylogenetic trees .
the nj analysis was constructed in mega 6.06 , the concatenated files were analyzed with k2p model , and the likelihood - based analyses were performed with 1,000 bootstrap replicates .
codon positions were combined as 1st + 2nd + 3rd + noncoding .
all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated .
the ml analysis was conducted using phyml 3.0 ( online execution ) based on the general time reversible ( gtr ) model .
fast likelihood - based analyses were performed with 1000 bootstrap replicates , sprs was applied for the tree search , and the starting tree was selected with bionj .

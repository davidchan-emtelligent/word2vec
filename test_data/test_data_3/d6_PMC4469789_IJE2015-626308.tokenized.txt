the purpose of the study was to assess the application value of vtq in dtd .
research design and methods .
thirty healthy subjects and 74 dtd patients were involved .
the thyroid stiffness , which was expressed by swv , was measured by vtq and compared between the patients and healthy people .
the relationship between swv and thyroid serological indexes was also analyzed. results .
the thyroid swvs of dtd patients were higher than those of the healthy ( 2.56 +/ - 1.33 m / s versus 1.74 +/ - 0.16 m / s , p = 0.011 ) .
there was no significant difference between the thyroid swvs in gd and ht patients ( p = 0.168 ) .
the swvs in patients with gd and ht were both higher than those of the healthy ( p < 0.05 ) .
the area under the roc curve was 0.938 for swv to distinguish between dtd and healthy thyroid. with a cutoff value of 2.02 m / s , the sensitivity and specificity were 81.12 % and 100.00 % , respectively .
additionally , we found a positive liner correlation between thyroid swv and tsh in dtd patients ( p < 0.001 ). conclusion .
swv is a good indicator of the thyroid tissue stiffness , which might be considered helpful in screening dtd .
what is more , swv might have a potential in assessing the thyroid function .
1. introduction a wide spectrum of diffuse diseases can affect the thyroid gland , such as graves' disease ( gd ) , hashimoto 's thyroiditis ( ht ) , subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis , and de quervain thyroiditis [ 1 ] .
the most common category of diffuse thyroid disease ( dtd ) is autoimmune thyroid diseases ( aitd ) , including ht and gd [ 2 ] .
ordinarily , a clinical diagnosis of dtd is made based on an algorithm of presenting symptoms , laboratory analysis of thyroid function , immunology , and occasionally imaging features [ 3 ] .
as the most commonly used imaging technique to screen dtd , ultrasound ( us ) could detect a subset of patients before they come to clinical attention and had roles in excluding focal thyroid disease and assessing the size of the thyroid [ 1 ] .
however , conventional ultrasound makes the diagnosis of dtd mainly based on the morphology changes , the level of echogenicity , and vascularity of the thyroid .
a certain diagnosis could be made only if all the typical image features emerged .
owing to the underlying similarities in the image features , it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between normal and dtd thyroid ( figure 1 ) , and the accuracy of such diagnosis is largely dependent on the experience of the operator and the adjustment of machine .
fortunately , an emerging ultrasound technique , named acoustic radiation force impulse ( arfi ) imaging , might be helpful to cover this shortage by offering the information of tissue stiffness .
it contains two modes , virtual touch tissue imaging ( vti ) and virtual tissue quantification ( vtq ) .
the former could provide the information of tissue elasticity qualitatively , while the latter could give an objective measurement quantitatively [ 4 , 5 ] .
during arfi examination , short - duration acoustic pulses are utilized to excite tissue in the region of interest ( roi ) mechanically .
then , shear waves are produced and spread away from the roi perpendicularly to the acoustic push pulse and generated localized , micron - scale displacements in the tissue [ 6 , 7 ] .
the displacements result in shear wave propagation away from the excited region and are tracked by ultrasound correlated methods. by measuring the time to peak displacement at each lateral location , the shear wave velocity ( swv ) within the tissue can be calculated ( expressed in m / s ) [ 5 ] .
generally , stiffer tissue has higher swv [ 6 ] .
recently , more and more studies have focused on the application of vtq .
it has been confirmed that vtq had the potential to differentiate between benign and malignant focal lesions in liver , breast , kidney , and thyroid [ 8 - 16 ] .
as we know , only a few researchers have published their preliminary results of the application of vtq in diffuse diseases , even fewer in thyroid [ 6 , 17 - 19 ] .
so our present study aims to evaluate the application of vtq in the diagnosis of diffuse thyroid diseases .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
study population this study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital .
all the subjects signed informed consent ( for the patients under 18 years old , the informed consents were signed by their parents ) .
ninety - six consecutive patients were diagnosed with dtd by clinical physicians from may 2012 to may 2013 in our hospital .
the enrollment criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) the patients had enough thyroid tissue to make the measurements all at the same depth ; ( 2 ) the patients had no history of thyroid operation or drug treatment ; ( 3 ) all the patients had thyroid serological testing results .
the exclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) the patients with thyroid nodule ; ( 2 ) abnormal thyroid function caused by systemic diseases except thyroid , such as pituitary disease ; ( 3 ) the patients who could not tolerate examination , for example , because of difficulties in breathing or suffering from a phobia .
all the patients were diagnosed according to the criteria as follows : gd was diagnosed based on the low titers of thyroid stimulating hormone ( tsh ) , high titers of free thyroxine ( ft4 ) , free triiodothyronine ( ft3 ) , and anti - tsh receptor antibodies in serum .
the diagnosis of ht was based on high titers of anti - thyroid antibodies ( thyroglobulin antibody and / or thyroglobulin antibody ) in serum , normal ( or low ) thyroid function [ 19 ] .
finally , 74 patients ( patients group , 16 men and 58 women ) were enrolled in this study , including 30 cases of gd ( gd group ) , age ranging from 19 to 55 yrs ( mean 35.0 +/ - 13.3 yrs ) , and 44 cases of ht ( ht group ) , age ranging from 12 to 67 yrs ( mean 44.2 +/ - 14.3 yrs ) .
the patient selection flowsheet was present in figure 2 .
additionally , 30 healthy subjects were involved in the study as control ( healthy group ) , including 7 men and 23 women , age ranging from 23 to 64 yrs ( mean 32.7 +/ - 14.9 yrs ) .
the enrollment criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) no lesion on thyroid gland and ( 2 ) normal thyroid function .
those with cardiac diseases , autoimmune diseases , or blood system diseases were excluded .
2.2 .
laboratory tests thyroid serological indexes including ft3 , ft4 , tsh , thyroglobulin antibody ( tgab ) , and thyroid peroxidase antibody ( tpoab ) were tested by chemiluminescence particles immune method before ultrasound examination .
the interval between laboratory tests and ultrasound examination was less than 1 week .
2.3 .
conventional us and elastography imaging during ultrasound examination , the subjects kept slow and even respiration , with neck fully exposed and head leaned backward .
the probe was placed tenderly on the cervical skin with light pressure .
all the subjects were examined by the same operator with six years of ultrasound operation experience .
the following conventional us features were recorded : the size and morphology of thyroid , the echotexture of thyroid parenchyma , and the internal blood supply .
as dtd was considered as a kind of diffuse disease , the bilateral pathologic changes of thyroid were deemed equal .
thus , in vtq measurements , we chose the left lobe instead of both lobes .
the sample frame of roi was 0.5 cm x 0.6 cm in size .
the selection criteria of roi were as follows : ( 1 ) the sample frame was , respectively , placed on upper , middle , and lower portions of the thyroid parenchyma on the largest longitudinal section , with a depth of 1.5 cm ; ( 2 ) the envelope , calcification , and internal blood vessels of the thyroid were avoided .
vtq measurements were performed repeatedly for 7 times in each region , and the results were expressed by swv ( m / s ) .
the highest and the lowest value were eliminated and the remaining 5 values were used for analysis .
the range of swv was 0 - 9 m / s , by the manufacturer 's algorithm .
value beyond this range was displayed as " x.xx m / s ," which meant the tissue was extremely hard or soft .
after excluding the possible relevant factors such as the operator 's inappropriate operation or the patient 's respiration , the value of " x.xx m / s " was allocated to be 0 m / s or 9 m / s , with 0 m / s corresponding cystic portion and 9 m / s corresponding solid portion [ 5 ] .
2.4 .
statistical analysis the statistical analyses were performed using spss 16.0 software package ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
all measurements were expressed as the mean value +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) .
the differences of swv between the healthy group and dtd group were compared by the single factor analysis of variance ; p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
the diagnostic performance of vtq in differentiating between healthy and dtd thyroid was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve ( roc ) .
in this curve , " 1 - specificity " was displayed on the horizontal axis , and " sensitivity " was displayed on the y - axis .
the points which composed the curve did not represent the distribution of swv , but each cutoff value was calculated by statistical software ( spss ) automatically .
when comparing different diagnostic methods , the larger the area under the curve ( auc ) , the better the diagnostic efficacy .
for a certain diagnostic method , the cutoff value was chosen by " youden index " ( formula : specificity + sensitivity - 1 ) .
the best cutoff value had the largest youden index .
the correlation between swv and serological testing indexes was analyzed by linear regression .
3. results the baseline characteristics of the subjects were presented in table 1 .
there was no significant difference between healthy group and dtd group in age or sex .
the thyroid swvs of dtd patients were higher than those of the healthy ( 2.56 +/ - 1.33 m / s versus 1.74 +/ - 0.16 m / s , p = 0.011 ) .
the swvs of the upper , middle , and lower part of the thyroid tissue in patients with gd and ht were all higher than those of the healthy ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 3 ) .
however , there were no significant differences between gd and ht groups in swv ( 2.14 +/ - 0.31 m / s versus 2.72 +/ - 1.52 m / s , p = 0.179 ) .
no matter in which group , no variance was detected between different thyroid parts in swv ( table 2 ) .
according to the analysis by roc , with a cutoff swv value of 2.02 m / s to distinguish dtd and healthy thyroid , the area under the curve was 0.938 ( figure 4 ) and the sensitivity and specificity were 81.12 % and 100.00 % , respectively .
according to the analysis by linear regression , we found that , in dtd patients , the swv values had positive linear correlation with tsh ( gamma = 0.945 , p < 0.001 ) , but not with ft3 or ft4 ( figure 5 ) .
moreover , the swv values had no correlation with tpoab or tgab in ht patients ( figure 6 ) .
4. discussion nowadays , many studies have focused on the feasibility of using vtq to differentiate between malignant and benign thyroid nodules [ 5 , 15 , 16 ] , but very few were concerned with the dtd .
accordingly , we set out to perform vtq examination to evaluate the thyroid tissue elasticity in dtd patients .
we found that , compared with healthy people , dtd patients generally had stiffer thyroid tissue .
stiffness or elasticity is one of the important physical parameters of biological tissue , which is largely dependent on the construction of cells and molecules in the tissue .
thus , stiffness usually changes with pathologic status .
as the patients in our study were all not treated , the stiffness of thyroid might reflect the tissue status objectively .
normal thyroid gland is characterized by even thyroid follicles and abundant capillaries which are evenly distributed between the follicles .
while for gd the pathological histology is characterized by diffuse hypertrophy and hyperplasia of follicular cells with colloid depletion and lymphoid infiltration [ 1 ] , for ht the pathological histology is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic aggregates with germinal centers , atrophic thyroid follicles , oxyphilic change of the epithelial cells , and variable fibrosis [ 20 ] .
moreover , collagen fibril is highly elastic [ 21 ] , which means that collagen fibril needs much force to make deformation and enables substantial energy dissipation during deformation .
in other words , under the same the external force , thyroid tissue with more collagen fibril generated less deformation .
these pathological changes might make the thyroid tissue stiffer both in gd and ht. correspondingly , we found that the thyroid swv in dtd patients was higher than that of the healthy .
in consideration of the fact that conventional us examination is largely dependent on the experience of operator , such objective indexes might make the sonographer more confident in making a dtd diagnosis .
nevertheless , our findings showed that the thyroid tissue in ht and gd had similar elasticity. that is to say , we could not differentiate between various dtd subtypes merely based on stiffness .
when introduced to clinical application , comprehensive information was still essential .
although the pathologic changes in dtd thyroid tissue were usually deemed even , we still analyzed the influence of sampling .
firstly , in our preliminary study we performed vtq examination on each side of the thyroid , respectively , to compare their stiffness , and found that there was no significant difference , no matter in healthy group or diffuse thyroid disease ( dtd ) group ( data not shown ) .
this result was consistent with another study [ 19 ] .
thus , to improve the efficiency in data collection and calculation , we uniformly chose the left lobe to perform vtq in our present study .
additionally , we also performed vtq at different positions in thyroid tissue and found that the measurement of a random position was equal to that of the whole .
these results were in accordance with the uniform pathologic changes of dtd and might simplify the measurement process during clinical application .
what is more , as vtq measurement was sometimes influenced by the patient 's respiration or the probe 's movement , it was necessary to be performed repeatedly .
in sporea et al. ' s research [ 19 ] , vtq measurements were repeated for 5 or 10 times to determine the proper times of repetition .
they found that there was no significant difference in data between 5 times and 10 times. that is to say , 5 times of repetition was adequate .
concerning the reliability of data , we thought that the highest and the lowest value would better be eliminated to avoid the occurrence of abnormal value .
for the above reasons , we performed 7 times of repetition and eliminated the highest and the lowest value .
the mean of the rest 5 values was used for analysis .
the same method has also been mentioned in zhang et al. ' s research [ 5 ] .
according to our study , a cutoff swv value of 2.02 m / s had the best capacity to diagnose dtd , while in sporea et al. ' s [ 19 ] research , the optimal cutoff value was 2.36 m / s. what is more , their thyroid swvs in dtd patients and healthy people were also both higher than those of ours .
even so , the cutoff value in both studies had similar and satisfactory diagnostic capacity .
we speculated that the diversity between the two studies might be explained by the differences in age and men / women distribution of the study cohort or the different operators , parameter settings , and measuring methods .
as thyroid is a parenchymal organ containing plenty of vessels , there might be discrepancy in cell distribution on different sections .
what is more , pulling strength acting on thyroid from each direction might be unbalanced , especially on different body position .
thyroid is anatomically fixed by the surrounding tissue , such as pretracheal fascia , lateral ligament , and suspensory ligament , which pull thyroid from different directions .
during vtq examination , acoustic push is applied to thyroid , which might simultaneously induce the surrounding tissue to react .
if we perform vtq on different sections , the pulling strength generated by the surrounding tissue might also be different , leading to a slight discrepancy in tissue deformation and swv measurements .
this phenomenon has not been reported in other studies and thus needs more clinical tests or even mechanical experiments to make it validated .
thus , specifying the section of measurements is necessary .
in our study , the thyroid swv in dtd patients had positive linear correlation with tsh titer , but not with ft3 or ft4 .
as tsh is the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function and disease progression [ 22 , 23 ] , swv value might have potential for assessing the thyroid function noninvasively and also reflect the progression of disease and therapeutic effect .
while concerning ft3 and ft4 , as all the patients in our study were diagnosed for the first time , most of them might be at the early stage of disease , and their ft3 and ft4 in serum might not change timely and sensitively .
additionally , we found that swv had no correlation with tgab or tpoab titer in ht patients .
although tgab and tpoab have high specificity on ht diagnosis [ 24 , 25 ] , the development of ht is a complex pathological process .
besides tgab and tpoab , many other kinds of autoimmune antibodies are also involved , such as thyroid stimulating antibody , thyrotropin receptor antibody , and thyroid inhibiting antibody .
the thyroid status in ht might be influenced by the coaction of various antibodies ; thus , the titer of tgab and tpoab alone might not reflect the thyroid pathologic status , not to mention the thyroid stiffness .
we must confess the limitations in our study .
firstly , only the gd and ht patients were involved .
other types of dtd , such as subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis and de quervain thyroiditis , need to be investigated further .
secondly , as a preliminary study , our sample size was relatively small .
study on large sample and the comparison between different races or nations are required .
thirdly , whether there is dynamic change in thyroid stiffness during treatment also needs to be investigated .
5. conclusion in conclusion , vtq could be used to assess the thyroid tissue stiffness quantitatively and might have a potential in assessing the thyroid function in dtd patients .
as an objective index , swv might be used complementarily with traditional ultrasound to make the sonographer more confident in making a dtd diagnosis .

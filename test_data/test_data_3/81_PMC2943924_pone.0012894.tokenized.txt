background type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) is an autoimmune disease resulting from defects in central and peripheral tolerance and characterized by t cell - mediated destruction of islet beta cells .
to determine whether specific lysosomal proteases might influence the outcome of a t cell - mediated autoimmune response , we examined the functional significance of cathepsin inhibition on autoimmune t1d - prone non - obese diabetic ( nod ) mice .
methods and findings here it was found that specific inhibition of cathepsin l affords strong protection from cyclophosphamide ( cy ) - induced insulitis and diabetes of nod mice at the advanced stage of cd8 + t cell infiltration via inhibiting granzyme activity .
it was discovered that cathepsin l inhibition prevents cytotoxic activity of cd8 + t cells in the pancreatic islets through controlling dipeptidyl peptidase i activity .
moreover , the gene targeting for cathepsin l with application of in vivo sirna administration successfully prevented cy - induced diabetes of nod mice .
finally , cathepsin l mrna expression of peripheral cd8 + t cells from nod mice developing spontaneous t1d was significantly increased compared with that from control mice .
conclusions our results identified a novel function of cathepsin l as an enzyme whose activity is essential for the progression of cd8 + t cell - mediated autoimmune diabetes , and inhibition of cathepsin l as a powerful therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diabetes .
introduction the cathepsins constitute a family of lysosomal proteases that are recognized as non - specific scavengers to recycle cellular proteins within lysosomes , and that are also found to display cell type - specific functions [ 1 ] - [ 5 ] .
although the action of lysosomal proteases is not necessarily limited to the endosomal system for antigen processing , it remains obscure in that the in vivo activity of lysosomal proteases regulates the peripheral immune responses .
studies of gene - knockout mice or specific inhibitors for cathepsins have demonstrated that the emzymatic activities of cathepsins play key roles in the pathogensesis of autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune myasthenia gravis , rheumatoid arthritis , sjogren 's syndrome , and autoimmune type - 1 diabetes ( t1d ) [ 6 ] - [ 9 ] .
as it was reported that cathepsin l - deficient nod mice are protected from insulitis and diabetes due to the increased number of regulatory t ( treg ) cells in the periphery through the defective thymic selection [ 10 ] , the therapeutic application with cathepsin inhibitor may be clinically useful .
however , it is still unclear whether cathepsin l plays any role in peripheral effector cells or cytotoxic cells other than treg cells in the development of autoimmune diabetes .
here the role of cathepsin l in cyclophosphamide ( cy ) - treated nonobese diabetic ( nod ) mice , a model for spontaneous t1d [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] using a cathepsin l - specific inhibitor was investigated .
it has been described that cy - induced t1d in the nod mouse is associated with a reduction of treg cells [ 13 ] .
in cathepsin l - deficient mice and cathepsin l - deficient nod mice , the direct effect of cathepsin l on the peripheral t cells has not been clarified ; although it was demonstrated that cathepsin l plays a key role in the t cell differentiation in the thymus [ 10 ] , [ 13 ] .
in this study , a novel function of cathepsin l as an enzyme whose activity is essential for the progression of cd8 + t cell - mediated autoimmune diabetes was identified , and the specific inhibition of cathepsin l as a powerful therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diabetes was demonstrated .
results effective treatment of cy - induced t1d in nod mice by a specific inhibitor of cathepsin l a specific inhibitor of the cathepsin l ( catl - inh ) [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] was intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) administered into cy - treated nod mice .
treatment with catl - inh protected diabetes - prone nod mice from subsequently occurring diabetes such as high blood sugar and urine sugar while there was no therapeutic effect of cathepsin b inhibitor ( catb - inh ) and cathepsin s inhibitor ( cats - inh ) ( figure 1a , b ) .
to determine whether catl - inh administration is effective on the onset of insulitis , histological sections for the presence of insulitis were analyzed .
the histological finding of islets from cy - treated nod mice showed lymphocytic infiltration , ranging from peri - insulitis to severe extensive , and atrophic or damaged islets with a decrease in cell numbers ( figure 1d , e , f ) , compared with that of control nod mice ( figure 1c ) .
in contrast , catl - inh protected severe insulitis and damage of islets , although a slight inflammatory lesion with peri - insulitis was observed ( figure 1g , h ) .
moreover , semiquantitative evaluation of islet inflammation was performed using pancreatic sections from control , cy - treated , and cy + catl inh - treated nod mice .
the histological score of cy - treated nod mice was significantly reduced by the administration of catl inh ( figure 1i ) .
this result showed that cathepsin l plays an important role in the onset of t1d in nod mice as previously described [ 10 ] , and that the specific cathepsin l inhibitor may be useful for the effective treatment of autoimmune diabetes .

data are shown as histological score of individual islets .
effects of catl - inh administration on peripheral immune cells it was reported that an increased proportion of treg cells in the periphery of cahtepsin l - deficient nod mice was observed compared with that of control nod mice [ 10 ] .
when foxp3 + cd4 + treg cells of pancreatic lymph nodes ( pln ) in cy - treated and control nod mice were analyzed , the number of treg cells of pln from cy - treated nod mice was significantly reduced compared with control nod mice as previously reported [ 13 ] .
on the other hand , there was no increase in the number of treg cells observed by the administration of catl - inh ( figure 2a ) .
in addition , to evaluate the effect of in vivo treatment with catl - inh in cy - treated nod mice on apcs such as b cells and dendritic cells ( dcs ) , the expressions of mhc class ii on the cells were detected by flow cytometric analysis .
the mhc class ii expression on pln b cells from cy - treated nod mice was increased compared with that from control nod mice ( figure 2b ) .
the enhanced level of the expression from cy - treated nod mice was not changed by the administration of catl - inh ( figure 2b ) .
also , there was no difference in the expression level of mhc class ii on dcs between cy - treated and cy + catl - inh - treated nod mice ( figure 2b ) .
although cathepsin l is well known to be one of the key proteases in the antigen processing of apcs of the thymus [ 10 ] , it is still unclear whether cathepsin l plays any role in the peripheral apcs such as b cells and dcs of lymph nodes .
to further investigate whether cathepsin l inhibition influences the antigen processing and presentation , an in vitro experiment using ovalbumin ( ova ) - specific t cell receptor ( tcr ) - transgenic mice ( ot - ii ) was conducted .
in brief , purified cd4 + t cells from the spleen of ot - ii mice were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester ( cfse ) , and co - cultured with t cell - depleted spleen cells as apcs from b6 mice in the presence of ova protein with or without catl - inh or cats - inh for three days .
a small inhibitory effect of catl - inh ( 0.05 , 0.5 microm ) on ot - ii t cell response to ova was observed although inhibitory effect of catl - inh at high concentration ( 5 microm ) on the t cell response was found ( figure s1 ) .
in contrast , cats - inh more effectively inhibited the proliferative response compared with the effect of catl - inh , indicating that cathepsin s , rather than cathepsin l , plays a crucial role in antigen processing and presentation of apcs .
the in vivo experiment using the catl - inh suggested that there may be no direct effect of cathepsin l on the apcs during the pathogenesis of t1d in nod mice .
moreover , to examine the effect of catl - inh administration on t cell activation , cd44 expression , an activation marker , was analyzed using pln t cells .
the enhanced activation of cd8 + , not cd4 + t cells in cy - treated nod mice was suppressed by the catl - inh administration ( figure 2c ) .
furthermore , as shown in figure 2d , the enzymatic activities of cathepsin l of pln cells from cy - treated nod mice was significantly higher than that from control nod mice .
additionally , we investigated endogenous cathepsin l mrna levels among various immune cell populations of pln from nod mice .
the highest expression of cathepsin l mrna was observed in cd8 + t cells ( figure 2e ) .
on the other hand , as shown in figure 2e and figure s1 , the expression of cathepsin l mrna of pln cd8 + t cells from nod mice was significantly higher than that from normal age - matched c57bl / 6j mice ( b6 : 1.28 +/ - 0.13 , nod : 3.2 +/ - 0.46x10 - 3 to beta - actin mrna expression , p < 0.05 ). by contrast , the expression levels of cd4 + , cd25 + cd4 + , b220 + b , and cd11c + cells from nod mice were similar to the levels of b6 mice ( figure s2 ) .
among the immune cells of b6 mice , the expression levels of cd8 + t cells and dcs were considerably increased compared with those of cd4 + , cd25 + cd4 + and b220 + cells ( figure s2 ) .
we suggest that this change in the cd8 + t cells may account for the protection of diabetes observed in catl - inh - treated nod mice .

data are shown as means +/ - s.d. of 3 to 4 mice in each group .
cathepsin l in cd8 t cells of cy - treated nod mice next , the role of cathepsin l of cd8 + t cells in the pancreas tissues from cy - treated nod mice was analyzed .
immunofluorescence staining showed an increased infiltration of cd8 + t cells in the islets from cy - treated nod mice compared to that from control nod mice ( figure 3a , right panel ) .
in control nod mice in which peri - insulitis was observed , the majority of infiltrating lymphocytes was cd4 + t cells , plus a small number of cd8 + t cells ( figure 3a , left panel ) .
additionally , flow cytometric analysis indicated that there was a significantly increased number of cd8 + t cells as well as cd4 + t cells in the pancreas tissues and plns from cy - treated nod mice compared with control nod mice ( figure 3b ) .
multiple lines of study have demonstrated the importance of cd8 + t cells in the pathogenesis of t1d in nod mice and t1d patients [ 16 ] - [ 18 ] .
to detect the enzymatic activity of cathepsin l of the infiltrating cd8 + t cells in the pancreas tissues , flow cytometric analysis using the fluorogenic substrates ( magic red ( tm )) of cathepsin l was performed .
a significantly enhanced cathepsin l activity of pancreatic cd8 + t cells from cy - treated nod mice was observed compared with that from control nod mice ( figure 3c ) .
in plns , a slight increased activity of cathepsin l in cd8 + t cells from cy - treated nod mice was detected ( figure 3c ) .
moreover , to understand the relationship between cytotoxic activity and enzymatic activity of cathepsin l in cd8 + t cells , both granzyme b expression and cathepsin l enzymatic activity were analyzed by flow cytometry. by cy - treatment , the cell numbers of granzyme b + catl + cd8 + t cells in both pancreas and plns were significantly increased compared with those from control nod mice ( figure 3d ) .
these results indicate that cathepsin l might control the cytotoxic activity of cd8 + t cells against the islets of pancreas in autoimmune diabetes of nod mice .

( c ) enzymatic activities of cathepsin l ( magic red ( tm )) of cd8 + t cells were detected by flow cytometric analysis using pancreas tissues and plns from control and cy - treated mice .
( d ) association of intracellular granzyme b expression with enzymatic activity of cathepsin l in cd8 + t cells was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis using pancreas tissues and plns from control and cy - treated mice .
results are representative of 3 to 4 mice in each group .
effective inhibition of catl - inh on ctl activity of cd8 t cells to further investigate the cellular mechanism of cd8 + t cell activation through cathepsin l , in vitro experiments using purified cd8 + t cells from plns of nod mice were performed .
no toxic effect of catl - inh on cd8 + t cells in this experiment was observed ( figure s3 ) .
when the cd8 + t cells were stimulated with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( pma ) and ionomycin ( im ) , the increased level of enzymatic activity of cathepsin l was confirmed by confocal analysis using magic red ( tm ) ( figure 4a ) .
increased granzyme b expression of cd8 + t cells was observed with the addition of pma / im. then the enhanced expression level was decreased by the addition of catl - inh ( figure 4b ) .
it has been reported that dipeptidyl peptidase i ( dppi ) is a granule protease that plays a requisite role in processing the proenzyme form of the cytotoxic t - lymphocyte ( ctl ) granule serine proteases ( granzymes ) [ 19 ] - [ 22 ] .
in addition to its role in the lysosomal protein degradation , dppi functions as a key enzyme in the activation of granule serine peptidases in ctl [ 23 ] .
since it has been demonstrated that cathepsin l could be an important activator of dppi from its precursor form in vitro [ 24 ] , the enzymatic activity of cd8 + t cells from nod mice was examined .
dppi enzymatic activity of cd8 + t cells was elevated by stimulation of pma / im , and the addition of catl - inh reduced the increased dppi activity ( figure 4c ) .
finally , it was examined whether cytotoxicity of the activated cd8 + t cells against the enriched islet cells is suppressed by catl - inh .
the islet cells from pancreas of nod mice were isolated as described in methods .
over 70 % of the enriched islet cells produced insulin ( figure s4a ) .
to evaluate the toxic effect of catl - inh on the islet cells as target cells , the isolated islet cells were incubated with catl - inh for 24 hours .
no change of apoptotic or necrotic cells showing annexin - v and pi was observed by this incubation ( figure s4b ) .
ctl activity of cd8 + t cells against the target cells from pancreas of nod mice was significantly suppressed by catl - inh ( figure 4d ) .
theses results indicated that a simple mechanism of inhibiting the activities of dppi by catl - inh could provide a powerful way to regulate the ability of immune effector cd8 + t cells to kill their targets .

effective therapy of cy - induced t1d by small interference ( si ) rna targeting cathepsin l gene to further confirm the effects of cathepsin l - inhibition , it was examined whether injection of athelocollagen - mediated small interference ( si ) rna for cathepsin l gene silencing provides long - term suppression of diabetes development in cy - treated nod mice .
evidence was obtained demonstrating that application of sirna targeting cathepsin l ( catl sirna ) intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) caused a marked decrease in the development of cy - induced diabetes in nod mice showing a high level of blood glucose ( figure 5a ) .
to confirm the effect of the cat l - sirna on the expression of the target gene , mrna expression of cathepsin l of pln cd8 + t cells was quantified by real - time pcr .
a reduced expression of cathepsin l mrna from catl sirna - treated mice was observed compared with that from control sirna - treated mice ( figure 5b ) .
histological analysis showed that inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes and destructive changes in islets of the pancreas tissues from catl sirna - treated mice were clearly prevented in contrast to the severe inflammatory lesions of control sirna - treated mice ( figure 5c ) .
furthermore , the histological score of infiltrates in islets from catl sirna - treated mice was significantly reduced compared with that from control sirna - treated mice ( figure 5d ) .
there were no differences in the cell numbers of t cell populations of plns between catl sirna - and control sirna - treated mice ( figure s5 ) .
in addition , the expression level of dppi mrna of pln cd8 + t cells from catl sirna - treated mice was lower than that from control sirna - treated mice ( figure 5e ) .
these results demonstrated that the gene targeting of cathepsin l by in vivo administration of sirna may be one therapeutic strategy for autoimmune diabetes .

cathepsin l mrna expression in spontaneous t1d of nod mice however , it is still unclear whether cathepsin l has an effect on the onset of autoimmne diabetes in nod mice .
it is well known that a considerable proportion of non - diabetic mice are included among nod littermates [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
thus , we analyzed the cathepsin l mrna levels of purified cd8 + t cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes ( pbls ) of non - diabetic and diabetic nod mice from three to nine months of age .
as shown in figure 6 , the expression of cathepsin l mrna of cd8 + t cells from diabetic nod mice was significantly higher than that from non - diabetic nod mice .
however , there was a range of cathepsin l expressions even in non - diabetic mice .
some differences in the disease development or onset in nod littermates may be associated with expression levels of cathepsin l. by contrast , enhanced expression of granzyme b in diabetic nod mice compared with that in non - diabetic nod mice could not be found ( data not shown ) .
on the other hand , when we compared the granzyme b expressions of infiltrating cd8 + t cells in the pancreas tissues between non - diabetic and diabetic nod mice by flow cytometry , significantly higher granzyme b expression of diabetic pancreatic cd8 + t cells was observed in diabetic nod mice ( figure s6 ) .
these findings suggest that cathepsin l expression in cd8 + t cells of peripheral blood dose not strictly reflect the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes in nod mice , but it may be one of helpful tools for diagnosis of t1d as well as the effective strategy by targeting cathepsin l gene .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0012894.g006 figure 6 cathepsin l expression of cd8 + t cells of nod mice .
the mrna expressions of cathepsin l of purified cd8 + from pbls from non - diabetic and diabetic nod mice were analyzed by real - time pcr .
mice exceeding 250 mg / dl blood glucose were considered diabetic .
data are shown as means +/ - s.d. of 5 to 10 mice in each group * , p < 0.05 .
discussion although type - 1 diabetes can be controlled by insulin injections , individuals who develop the disease may suffer long - term complications that include blindness , kidney failure and premature vascular disease leading to early death [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
the disease is increasing in incidence worldwide .
thus there is a pressing need to understand pathogenic mechanisms to design effective immunotherapeutic preventions .
these results demonstrate that cathepsin l , which has been thought to be an antigen - processing enzyme , plays a critical role in the peripheral immune system .
cathepsin l functions under the acidified conditions in the endosome , and plays an important role in the dppi signaling events in cd8 + t cells .
it is well known that cathepsin l is involved in the proteolysis of mhc class ii - associated invaliant chain ( ii ) and the antigen presentation in cortical thymic epithelial cells [ 29 ] - [ 31 ] .
in this study , it was demonstrated that cathepsin l has a pivotal effect at the upstream of granzyme b on cytotoxicity of cd8 + t cells in the development of t1d other than the maintenance of treg cells in the periphery and the thymic selection .
two reports using cathepsin l - deficient mice focused on treg cells which control autoimmune diabetes in nod mice [ 10 ] , [ 32 ] .
both papers showed that the expression of cathepsin l was not required for the disease induction .
however , there was a big difference in the incidences of cumulative diabetes between cd25 - depleted control and cd25 - depleted cat - l - / - splenocytes - transferred recipients [ 10 ] , [ 32 ] .
we speculate that treg cells play an important role in the disease induction or onset of autoimmune diabetes in nod mice , and that the development or severity of the disease may be attributed to other immune cells including cd8 + t cells in addition to the treg cells .
moreover , although significantly increased treg cells in cathepsin l - deficient nod mice were detected , there was no difference in the treg cell number of plns between cy and cy + catl - inh - treated nod mice in our experiment .
as for the discrepancy , the cathepsin l inhibitor might be effective for peripheral t cells , but not t cell differentiation including treg cells in the thymus .
the effectiveness may depend on the dose , time span , or timing of catl - inh administration , while the weakness of the treatment with specific catl - inh is that the metabolic time is considerably short in vivo .
within approximately 24 hours , the effectiveness had disappeared in the animal 's bodies .
in addition , it was reported that there was an effect of cathepsin l inhibition using catl - inh on antigen processing in the peripheral lymphoid tissues [ 33 ] .
in our study using catl - inh and sirna of cathepsin l , although we focused on cd8 + t cells , possible roles in other immune cells besides cd8 + t cells should be researched .
as for the adverse effects of injection of cahtepsin l inhibitor , when body weight , health condition , and a histopahtological examination of all organs from catl - inh - administerred mice was checked , there was no significant change .
this suggests that the catl - inh has no toxicity or side effects , and the application may be clinically useful .
also the administration of sirna targeting cathepsin l genes using athelocollagen may have a temporary effect on the peripheral t cells .
it is possible that the sirna might not have any effect on the gene - knockdown in the thymus .
when atelocollagen , which is positively charged , interacts with the negatively charged sirna duplex , a sirna / atelocollagen complex is formed .
this is a nanosize particle with a diameter of 100 - 300 nm. the sirna / atelocollagen complex was highly stable against nucleases and a prolonged release of genes and oligonucleotides without the digestion of rnase [ 34 ] .
additionally , it was confirmed that regarding to specificity for cathepsin l sirna , there was a reduction of cathepsin l mrna of cd8 + t cells in pln from cathepsin l sirna - treated nod compared with that from control nod mice ( relative expression to beta - actin mrna ; control sirna : 3.62x10 - 3 , cathepsin l sirna : 0.48x10 - 3 ) .
a previous report showed that a reduced number of cd4 + t cells in the thymus and periphery of cathepsin l deficient mice was observed , and that cd8 + t cells in the deficient mice were relatively increased [ 29 ] .
cathepsin l was found to be necessary for invariant chain ( ii ) degradation in cortical thymic epithelial cells [ 29 ] .
the degradation of ii is known to be a critical step in mhc class ii - restricted antigen presentation that is closely related with cd4 + t cell differentiation [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
in addition to the function of cathepsin l in central tolerance of thymus , we propose that a significantly upregulated cathepsin l activity in cytotoxic cd8 + t cells from nod mice might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of t1d .
it is known that cd8 + t cells as well as cd4 + t cells are pivotal effector cells for rapid destruction of pancreatic b - cells in cy - induced t1d [ 37 ] .
in our experiment , the cytotoxic activity of nod cd8 + cells from spleen against enriched islet cells from nod pancreas was significantly reduced by the addition of catl - inh .
splenic cd8 + t cells including a very low number of b cell antigen - specific cd8 + t cells in nod mice were stimulated with pma and ionomycin , and used for in vitro ctl assay .
the antigen - specificic ctl activity of cd8 + t cells in development of autoimmune diabetes of nod mice remains unsolved .
on the other hand , it would be helpful for diagnosis of spontaneous diabetes in nod mice to measure cathepsin l expression in the peripheral t cells .
under three months of age , there was no change in the cathepsin l expression .
in addition , we have confirmed that the expression of cathepsin l mrna of cd8 + t cells in peri - pancreatic ln was significantly enhanced compared with that of the other immune cells including cd4 + t cells , treg cell , b cells , and dendritic cells .
those findings suggested that cathepsin l in cd8 + t cells might be activated at an advanced stage of the disease in nod mice .
however , it is still unclear why cytotoxic activity of cd8 + from nod mice could be upregulated via the axis of cathepsin l , dppi , and granzyme b. in addition , we should pay attention for using the mrna level of cathepsin l in the peripheral cd8 + t cells as the level dose not strictly reflect the onset or development of autoimmune diabetes in nod mice .
further investigation would be required for the clinical application in human patients .
foxp3 - expressing cd4 + thymus - derived naturally occurring treg cells play an indispensable role in the maintenance of self - tolerance and immune homeostasis [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
they are potent suppressors of organ - specific autoimmunity such as t1d , inflammatory bowel disease , and autoimmune gastritis [ 40 ] .
multiple reports have implicated treg cells in the prevention of t1d [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
in aged nod mice , t1d resistance has been correlated with the expansion of treg cells with regulatory activity within inflamed pancreatic lymph nodes [ 43 ] .
furthermore , it was demonstrated that foxp3 - deficient nod mice , which are deficient in treg cells , display an increased incidence and earlier onset of t1d compared with control nod mice [ 44 ] .
administration of high - dose cy to prediabetic nod mice leads to rapid synchronous onset of t1d ( 11 ) , and transfer of lymphocytes from syngenic non - diabetic nod mice after cy treatment protects from t1d onset [ 12 ] .
as for a cellular mechanism for cy - induced t1d in nod mice , it was reported that the onset of cy - induced t1d is associated with a reduction of treg cells [ 13 ] .
it is possible that a reduction of treg cells in nod mice by cy injection might trigger up - regulated cathepsin l activity following cytotcoxicity of cd8 + t cells against pancreatic b - cells through unknown molecular mechanisms .
our previous report indicated that cathepsin s inhibitor can prevent sjogren ' syndrome which is one of the organ - specific autoimmune diseases found in salivary and lacrimal glands [ 8 ] .
moreover , it was demonstrated that impairment of ii degradation and diminished collagen - induced arthritis were observed in cathepsin s - deficient mice [ 45 ] .
in the case of a cathepsin s inhibition or deficiency , the protection of autoimmune response seems to be due to modulation of antigen presentation .
in the present study , there was no observation of therapeutic effect of cathepsin s inhibitor on cy - induced t1d in nod mice .
this implies that lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin l and s play a critical role in each step of pathogenesis for autoimmune diseases via complex molecular mechanisms .
careful attention should be paid to the therapeutic effects of cathepsin l inhibition on the immune system in the treatment of autoimmune diabetes , the pathogenesis of which is dependent on cd8 + t cells .
targeting these cd8 + t cells using cathepsin l inhibitor could be a strategy for the prevention and cure of diabetes in the near future .
taken together , the results of the experiments presented in this report show that treatment with cathepsin l inhibition prevents the cytotoxic cd8 + t cell response in autoimmune diabetes nod mice via inhibiting granzyme b activation .
these data point to cathepsin l as a novel regulatory mechanism of cytotoxicity , suggesting a potential use of cathepsin l inhibition including sirnas delivery as a new therapeutic target in autoimmune diabetes .

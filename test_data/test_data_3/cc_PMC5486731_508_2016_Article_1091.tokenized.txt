summary patients with aplastic anemia or hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome ( mds ) may respond to immunosuppressive therapy , including the anti - cd52 antibody alemtuzumab .
we analyzed treatment responses to alemtuzumab in 5 patients with mds or aplastic anemia ( aa ) evolving to mds .
two patients with hypoplastic mds ( hmds ) showed a partial response ( pr ) to alemtuzumab .
in both responding patients , a concomitant paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( pnh ) clone was detected before therapy .
one responder relapsed after 15 months and underwent successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation .
both patients are still alive and in remission after 40 and 20 months , respectively .
the other patients showed no response to alemtuzumab .
one patient died from pneumonia 4 months after treatment .
in summary , our data confirm that alemtuzumab is an effective treatment option for a subset of patients with mds , even in the presence of a pnh clone .
keywords myelodysplastic syndrome paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( pnh ) progenitor cells issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag gmbh austria 2017 introduction specific therapeutic options for patients suffering from aa and hmds are limited .
one treatment option is immunosuppressive therapy ( ist ) [ 1 - 4 ] .
although various forms of ist have been suggested , treatment with anti - thymocyte globulin ( atg ) combined with cyclosporine a ( csa ) is regarded first - line standard in older patients with aa and those who have no suitable transplant donor [ 3 ] .
however , atg / csa treatment requires hospitalization and is often associated with considerable side effects [ 3 ] .
in addition , there are patients who do not respond to atg / csa or relapse after such treatment .
in recent years , the monoclonal cd52 antibody alemtuzumab has been introduced as a new type of ist in patients with aa and hypoplastic mds [ 5 - 10 ] .
alemtuzumab may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously in these patients .
however , the protocols for aa and mds differ substantially from that used to treat lymphoma patients .
whereas in lymphoproliferative diseases , alemtuzumab is often administered in repeated cycles for several months [ 11 ] , in aa and mds patients , the antibody is administered over 5 - 10 consecutive days in one cycle which may be followed by treatment with csa [ 5 - 10 ] .
this one - cycle alemtuzumab regimen is considered to be better tolerated with less frequent infectious complications .
several prognostic factors predicting the response to atg / csa in patients with aa and mds have been described .
in aa , these include cytogenetic aberrations [ 12 ] , a ( small ) paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( pnh ) clone [ 13 ] , age , and ' pretherapy ' blood counts [ 14 , 15 ] .
in mds , the presence of hla dr15 , younger age , shorter duration of transfusion dependence , pancytopenia , low international prognostic score ( ipss ) , bone marrow ( bm ) hypocellularity and - - like in aa - - the presence of a pnh clone , have been associated with a better outcome [ 4 , 16 - 18 ] .
no such prognostic factors have been established for aa or mds patients receiving alemtuzumab as ist so far .
we analyzed ' pretherapy ' parameters and responses in five patients with dysplastic / aplastic bm who received alemtuzumab as ist .
patients and methods diagnostic evaluations data of five patients treated with alemtuzumab were analyzed retrospectively .
diagnoses ( mds or / and aa ) were established by examining peripheral blood counts , bm biopsy sections , smears , and karyotyping before treatment with alemtuzumab .
the numbers of colony - forming progenitor cells ( cfu ) were studied in all patients .
( table 1 ) .
moreover , patients were examined for the presence of a pnh clone by flow cytometry .
the study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical university of vienna .

their median age at treatment start ( alemtuzumab ) was 54 years ( range 44 - 69 ) .
the time from first diagnosis to alemtuzumab treatment ranged between 1 and 21 years ( table 2 ) .
aa and mds were classified according to published criteria [ 3 , 19 , 20 ] .

two of them had failed one cycle of atg / csa before being treated with alemtuzumab (# 3 and # 5 ) , and one patient had received two cycles of atg / csa without success (# 2 ) .
the interval between failed atg / csa and alemtuzumab ranged from 6 - 25 months .
patient # 4 was diagnosed with aa in 1990 and treated with atg / csa in 1998 which led to a complete remission ( cr ) .
after interferon - alpha treatment for hepatitis c , she relapsed in 2008 .
however , her relapsed aa responded well to re - administration of csa .
in 2011 ( 21 years after first diagnosis ) the patient 's disease evolved to mds .
she was then treated with 5 - azacitidine , albeit without response , and subsequently received alemtuzumab .
patient # 1 was treated with alemtuzumab upfront .
treatment with alemtuzumab four patients (# 2 , # 3 , # 4 , # 5 ) received alemtuzumab according to published protocols for treatment of aa [ 5 ] .
in particular , alemtuzumab was administered subcutaneously in increasing doses , starting with 3 mg on day 1 , followed by 10 mg on day 2 , and 30 mg on days 3 - 5 , resulting in a total dose of 103 mg alemtuzumab .
patients # 2 , # 3 , and # 5 received additional csa .
the dose of csa was adjusted to achieve a blood trough level of 150 - 200 microg / l. treatment was well tolerated , and no dose - reduction or treatment discontinuation was required .
patient # 1 was treated with alemtuzumab following a protocol described by sloand et al .
[ 8 ] without csa .
after initiation of treatment with 1 mg on day 1 , the patient received 3 mg alemtuzumab on day 2 and 10 mg for additional 9 days intravenously , amounting to a total dose of 94 mg alemtuzumab .
premedication consisted of glucocorticosteroids , paracetamol , and histamine receptor blockers .
monitoring of laboratory parameters in the follow - up follow - up examinations included complete blood counts , serum chemistry , and clinical parameters .
in three patients , cfu numbers were recorded in the follow - up , namely in patients # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 .
in four patients , bm examination was repeated after alemtuzumab treatment (# 1 , # 2 , # 3 , # 5 ) .
chromosome analysis was performed in all patients before therapy ; and in three patients (# 1 , # 2 , # 3 ) , karyotyping was also performed after alemtuzumab therapy .
gpi - linked surface markers were analyzed in case of suspected hemolysis (# 1 , # 2 , # 3 , # 4 ) .
response evaluation due to the overlapping nature of the diseases recorded in our patients , responses were classified according to response criteria proposed for aa as well as published response criteria for patients with mds [ 21 , 22 ] .
responses according to aa response - criteria were classified as : complete remission ( cr ) , partial remission ( pr ) , and no remission ( nr ) .
cr was defined as absolute neutrophil count ( anc ) > 1.5 g / l , normal hemoglobin ( hb ) , and platelet counts ( plt ) > 150 g / l. a pr required transfusion independence and no longer meeting criteria for severe disease .
patients were considered nr when they did not meet criteria for pr or cr. responses according to mds criteria were classified as described by cheson et al .
[ 22 ] : ( 1 ) alteration of the natural history of the disease , ( 2 ) cytogenetic response , ( 3 ) hematologic improvement .
progenitor cell assay progenitor cell assays were performed using methylcellulose and colony - stimulating cytokines as described [ 23 ] .
based on morphologic appearance and size , colonies were classified as colony - forming unit granulocyte / macrophage ( cfu - gm ) , burst - forming unit erythroid ( bfu - e ) and colony - forming unit granulocyte / erythrocyte / monocyte / megakaryocyte ( cfu - gemm ) . immunohistochemistry immunohistochemistry was performed on serial sections prepared from paraffin - embedded , formalin - fixed bm biopsy specimens using the indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique essentially as described [ 24 , 25 ] .
the following antibodies ( ab ) were applied : anti - cd34 monoclonal ab ( clone qbend10 , igg1 mouse , novocastra , newcastle , uk ) , anti - cxcr4 polyclonal ab ( igg1 rabbit , sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) and anti - vegf polyclonal ab ( igg1 rabbit , santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , ca , usa ) .
results primary response to treatment with alemtuzumab five patients with mds or aa received alemtuzumab ; one of these patients was treated with alemtuzumab upfront (# 1 ) , whereas four patients received alemtuzumab as second or third line therapy .
two of the five patients achieved a partial remission following alemtuzumab treatment (# 2 and # 3 ) .
time to pr was 3 and 6 months in patients # 2 and # 3 , respectively according to aa criteria .
the other three patients did not respond to alemtuzumab .
the patients' responses to alemtuzumab treatment , according to aa and mds response criteria , are shown in table 3 .

patient # 4 died from pneumonia 4 months after the start of alemtuzumab .
the other two nonresponding patients were further treated with best supportive care .
one patient (# 2 ) with a pr developed a relapse 15 months after the start of alemtuzumab .
because of severe thrombocytopenia the patient was treated with eltrombopag , albeit without response .
since the patient had a matched unrelated donor and suffered from life - threatening cytopenia , stem cell transplantation was performed .
apart from a moderate graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd ) , the course was uneventful and the patient remained in cr during the observation period .
patient # 3 achieved a continuous pr. survival and progression - free survival all patients had regular follow - up investigations in our departments .
relevant data , including remission status and disease progression , were collected approximately 3 months , 6 months , and subsequently every 6 months after treatment .
patient # 3 achieved a pr 6 months after therapy and remains in pr at 36 months .
the other responding patient (# 2 ) had a relapse 15 months after alemtuzumab .
subsequently she successfully underwent allogenic sct and achieved a cr from both aa / mds and pnh .
three other patients did not respond to alemtuzumab therapy .
patient # 4 succumbed to pneumonia even though at the time of her death no granulocytopenia was noted .
the mds of patient # 1 progressed to raeb - 1 approximately 3.5 years after alemtuzumab .
in patient # 5 , blood counts remained low but stable and no overt disease progression occurred until he was lost for follow - up 2 years after alemtuzumab .
response to alemtuzumab and survival are shown in fig. 1. fig. 1 response and overall survival .
patients # 1 , # 4 , and # 5 did not respond to alemtuzumab and patient # 4 died from pneumonia 4 months after therapy .
patient # 2 achieved a pr , relapsed and subsequently underwent allogeneic sct leading to a cr. in this patient , eculizumab was started 12 months after alemtuzumab and continued until sct .
patient # 3 achieved a continuous pr. nr no remission ; pr partial remission ; re relapse ; cr complete remission ; sct stem cell transplantation short - term and long - term toxicity of alemtuzumab alemtuzumab was well tolerated .
mild drug reactions such as pruritus and rash were noted in three patients (# 1 , # 2 , # 5 ) .
in addition one of them was treated for arterial hypertension (# 1 ) .
all symptoms were readily kept under control and none of the side effects resulted in dose modifications or treatment interruption .
in two patients (# 3 , # 4 ) no side effects were noted during and shortly after therapy .
patient # 2 developed a thyroiditis several months after alemtuzumab treatment .
this condition responded well to corticosteroids , but led to a permanent impairment of thyroid function .
a relationship between thyre oiditis and alemtuzumab treatment has been described previously [ 9 ] and therefore cannot be excluded in our case .
patient # 4 died from pneumonia 4 months after alemtuzumab treatment , despite antiviral and antibiotic prophylaxis with valaciclovir and cotrimoxazol .
in the other patients , no life - threatening bacterial or viral infections were recorded .
no secondary neoplasms were detected in our patients .
correlation between clinical / laboratory parameters and treatment responses no obvious correlations between responses to therapy with alemtuzumab were found when comparing blood counts , karyotypes , hla dr15 expression , age , gender , transfusion burden , and histologic bone marrow parameters .
impact of a concomitant pnh clone two patients (# 2 , # 3 ) developed a pnh clone .
in both cases , the pnh clone was detected after treatment with atg / csa and before alemtuzumab therapy .
in patient # 3 , the clone size before therapy was 17 % and remained stable at 17 and 21 % at 1 year and 2 years after alemtuzumab start , respectively .
a decrease to 6 % in the third year was noted .
no substantial hemolysis occurred in this patient .
the pnh clone size of patient # 2 amounted to 60 % before alemtuzumab therapy and gradually increased to 98 % in the following months .
in this patient , a considerable hemolysis was found , so that eculizumab therapy was initiated ( 12 months after alemtuzumab ) .
this patient was found to respond to eculizumab and was later transplanted .
evaluation of colony - forming progenitor cells peripheral blood cfu counts were analyzed before and after alemtuzumab in both responding patients (# 2 , # 3 ) as well as in patient # 1 .
in patient # 2 , cfu were recorded 2 months prior and 9 months after alemtuzumab .
cfu - gm levels increased from 0 / ml to 6 / ml , bfu - e from 0 / ml to 70 / ml and cfu - gemm from 0 / ml to 12 / ml blood , respectively .
hematologic relapse was accompanied by a decrease in all cfu - subsets to 0 / ml blood .
in patient # 3 , cfu - gm levels increased from 12 / ml to 15 / ml blood , bfu - e from 10 / ml to 44 / ml , and cfu - gemm from 0 / ml to 5 / ml when comparing cfu counts obtained before alemtuzumab treatment with that measured 7 months after therapy .
in patient # 1 , cfu were analyzed 29 months prior to alemtuzumab treatment and 10 months afterwards .
cfu - gm increased from 24 / ml to 72 / ml , while bfu - e ( 106 / ml vs 6 / ml ) and cfu - gemm ( 6 / ml vs 0 / ml ) decreased after treatment in this patient .
histology and immunohistochemistry immunostaining of bm sections , using antibodies against cd34 , cxcr4 , and vegf , was performed in three patients before and after alemtuzumab therapy .
pretreatment sections were hypocellular and the bm microvessel density was low ( fig. 2 ) .
after therapy , cellularity and microvessel density increased markedly in both responding patients (# 2 and # 3 ) .
surprisingly however , patient # 1 who showed no response to alemtuzumab as defined by aa and mds criteria , also showed an increase in bm cellularity and microvessel density after treatment ( fig. 2 ) .
however , this patient developed raeb - 1 after therapy. fig. 2 bone marrow cellularity and microvessel density .
immunostaining using antibodies against cd34 , cxcr4 , and vegf of bone marrow sections of three patients before ( a ) and after ( b ) alemtuzumab therapy .
microvessel density and bone marrow cellularity increased following alemtuzumab therapy in both responding patients (# 2 and # 3 ) and - - surprisingly - - also in the nonresponding patient # 1 cytogenetics patients # 2 and # 5 had a normal karyotype .
in patient # 1 a trisomy 8 was detected at diagnosis and the karyotype remained unchanged after alemtuzumab treatment .
patient # 3 had a normal karyotype at diagnosis , but developed a 13q - with a subclone carrying monosomy 13 after one ( unsuccessful ) cycle of atg / csa .
following alemtuzumab therapy these aberrations disappeared .
analysis in patient # 4 revealed a trisomy 8 and as the disease progressed , an additional isochromosome 17 was detected .
no karyotyping was performed after alemtuzmab treatment in this patient .
discussion alemtuzumab seems to be a promising option for patients who have not responded to or have relapsed after atg / csa immunosuppression [ 5 - 10 ] .
it is unclear however , whether there are predictive factors for response to this regimen .
we describe 5 patients with aa or mds , who were treated with alemtuzumab .
in two of these patients , a remission was obtained , and one patient is still in pr after 36 months , whereas the other patient relapsed and was successfully transplanted using allogeneic stem cells .
these data confirm earlier reports and suggest that alemtuzumab remains a treatment option for patients with relapsing aa or / and mds [ 5 - 10 ] .
different criteria for response to treatment have been described for aa [ 21 ] and mds [ 22 ] .
however , it seemed problematic to apply the response classification proposed by cheson et al. for mds [ 22 ] in patients suffering from hmds .
in these patients , blast cell counts are usually low even before therapy and therefore cannot be used to quantify a response .
since the only difference between cr and pr in the mds response criteria [ 22 ] are blast cell counts (' altering the natural history of the disease ') , virtually all patients with improved blood counts that do not reach the levels for a cr also fail to achieve a pr and have to be classified as ' stable disease ' despite their markedly improved blood counts .
applying response criteria as published for aa [ 21 ] might be a useful alternative for response evaluation in hmds .
alternatively , new response criteria for hmds need to be established in the future .
a variety of prognostic factors for response to ist with atg / csa in aa and mds have been identified .
these include cytogenetic aberrations [ 12 ] , ' pretherapy ' blood counts [ 14 , 15 ] , and the presence of a pnh clone [ 13 , 16 ] .
in particular , a small pnh clone has been linked to superior outcome after atg / csa treatment in aa as well as in mds patients [ 13 , 16 ] .
in two of our patients , clonal evolution to overt pnh occurred during atg / csa therapy , before alemtuzumab was initiated .
interestingly , these two patients were found to achieve a remission in response to alemtuzumab .
obviously , larger studies with more patients are warranted to clarify whether indeed a pnh clone is indicative of a good response to alemtuzumab second - line treatment in hmds or aa. so far , little is known about the value of cfu counting in patients with aa or hmds in whom ist is applied [ 26 ] .
however , it is well known that cfu are markedly decreased in these patients .
in the present study , we found that pretreatment progenitor cell counts ( but not pretherapy blood counts ) correlate with the response to alemtuzumab in our patients .
in particular , the two patients who responded to alemtuzumab were those with the lowest pretherapy progenitor cell counts , and in both , cfu levels increased during treatment .
again , larger studies are needed to clarify whether progenitor cell counts might be a useful tool to identify patients more likely to profit from alemtuzumab treatment .
thus , it might be possible to exclude patients unlikely to respond to alemtuzumab from this therapy and thereby avoid unnecessary exposure to this ist and the related risk .
infectious complications are a major concern after alemtuzumab therapy .
even though the regimens used to treat aa and mds are considerable shorter in duration ( treatment - days ) than those used for cll , the alemtuzumab - induced immunosuppression may still facilitate infections in aa and mds patients .
no serious infections were noted in four of our patients , but one patient died from pneumonia 4 months after alemtuzumab therapy .
it remains unknown however , whether the pneumonia observed in patient # 4 was related to treatment - induced immunosuppression .
this patient had received standard antiviral and antibiotic prophylaxis after treatment and her neutrophil count had improved substantially after therapy .
no pathogen was identified .
the dramatic rise of this patient 's neutrophil and platelet counts shortly before her death was unexpected and may or may not have be related to alemtuzumab therapy .
another explanation for the improvement of her blood counts could be a late reaction to prior azacitidine therapy .
in addition , the rising counts may also just have reflected an acute phase reaction in connection with the infection that ultimately led to her demise .
patients in our study were relatively young when compared to typical mds populations .
however , the age of our patients ( median 54 years , range 44 - 69 ) is similar to that published for other mds patients treated with ist [ 2 , 4 ] .
one possibility for the younger age in these patients ( and our patients ) may be the fact that patients with hypoplastic mds or a mds - aa overlap type of disease are younger than other patients suffering from classical mds types .
an alternative explanation may be that older patients with such overlapping disease are no longer considered for interventional therapies and are therefore not referred to major hematology centers .
the combination of atg and csa is considered standard therapy for aa and hmds patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation [ 3 , 4 ] .
it is unknown whether alemtuzumab in combination with csa is superior to alemtuzumab alone for treatment of aa or hmds .
regimens with and without csa have been shown to be effective in this setting [ 5 - 10 ] .
in our study , three patients , including both responding patients , had received csa concomitantly with alemtuzumab therapy .
it seems unlikely that csa alone was responsible for the remission in our patients since both had received csa after atg and relapsed while receiving csa treatment .
however , one might speculate that the combination of csa and alemtuzumab could be superior to alemtuzumab treatment alone .
in conclusion , alemtuzumab can be administered safely without major side effects and is effective in a subset of patients with aplastic and / or dysplastic bone marrow disorders .
therefore , alemtuzumab therapy should be considered in select patients with hypoplastic mds .
however , larger studies are needed to determine the efficacy and risk of long - term complications of alemtuzumab treatment in aa / mds patients and to predict what subsets of patients would indeed benefit from this therapy .

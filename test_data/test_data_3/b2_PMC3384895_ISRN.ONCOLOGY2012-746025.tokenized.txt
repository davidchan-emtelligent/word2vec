abcg2 is an efflux transporter commonly found to overexpress in multidrug resistant ( mdr ) cancer cells .
it is also believed to be a survival factor for cancer stem cells to drive tumor growth .
tumor microenvironment represents an attractive new drug target because it allows complex interaction between a tumor and its surrounding normal cells , molecules , and blood vessels , which all participate in tumor progression .
hypoxia , glucose deprivation and acidosis are the hallmarks of tumor microenvironment .
this study investigated the upregulation of abcg2 by these adverse growth conditions within the tumor microenvironment .
reporter gene assay revealed that a region within the abcg2 promoter close to the reported hif - 1alpha response element is responsible for abcg2 upregulation .
increased abcg2 efflux activity was observed under the same conditions , subsequently leading to reduced response to abcg2 substrate anticancer drug .
importantly , glucose deprivation and hypoxia were also found to enhance the resistance level of abcg2 - overexpressing resistant cells with pre - existing genetic and epigenetic mdr mechanisms .
hypoxia was further demonstrated to cause a more malignant anchorage - independent growth phenotype in the resistant cells , which can be abolished by knocking down abcg2 .
a better understanding of abcg2 regulation by the tumor microenvironment may help design novel strategies to improve treatment outcome .
1. introduction multidrug resistance ( mdr ) remains a major unresolved obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy .
it is usually associated with an increased efflux of cytotoxic drugs by atp - binding cassette ( abc ) transporters including abcg2 .
abc transporters are energy - dependent transporters that normally function in the detoxification and protection of normal cells from xenobiotics .
overexpression of abcg2 in cancer cell lines in vitro has been shown to confer mdr to a variety of anticancer drugs including mitoxantrone , irinotecan , methotrexate , flavopiridol , and anthracyclines [ 1 ] .
moreover , growing evidence suggests that abcg2 underlies the mdr of clinical samples from different cancers [ 2 ] .
abcg2 also plays a critical role in hypoxic defense mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment [ 3 ] .
it may also contribute to the maintenance of stem or progenitor cells as a survival factor , ultimately driving tumor growth [ 4 ] .
identification of factors that can influence abcg2 expression and activity might lead to the development of new strategies to modulate abcg2 - mediated drug transport clinically .
cancer cells do not exist in isolation .
they can be thought of as inhabiting within a complex milieu of normal cells , blood vessels , endogenous small molecules , and secreted factors , which collectively comprise the tumor microenvironment .
recent advances have indicated that the tumor microenvironment is critically important for cancer initiation , progression , metastasis , and drug resistance , thus providing opportunities for therapeutic intervention .
this study aims to evaluate the regulation of abcg2 in response to a few characteristic growth conditions within the tumor microenvironment , including hypoxia , glucose deprivation , and low ph. cancer cells are often confronted with a remarkable reduction in oxygen supply inside solid tumors , leading to intratumoral hypoxia .
hypoxia - inducible factor ( hif - 1alpha ) , the master regulator of hypoxic response , is accumulated in order to adapt to the adverse growth condition .
the production of vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) and other hypoxia - induced angiogenic cytokines to promote increase tissue vascularization , and the metabolic switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism represent the two major adaptive responses to enhance cell survival under tumor hypoxic condition .
glucose depletion is often observed in malignant tumors due to insufficient blood supply in the core of solid tumors [ 5 ] and increased rate of glycolysis [ 6 ] .
on the other hand , the production of lactic acid under anaerobic conditions and the hydrolysis of atp in an energy - deficient environment contribute to the acidic microenvironment that has been shown in many types of tumor ( warburg 's effect [ 7 ]) .
while the effect of tumor microenvironment on oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been extensively studied recently [ 8 ] , less is known about how this may modulate the xenobiotic transporters thus mediating multidrug resistance .
a better understanding of this complicated interaction may allow us to design novel therapeutic strategies to improve treatment outcome in chemotherapy .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
chemicals cisplatin was obtained from strem chemicals ( newburyport , ma ) .
mitoxantrone and 2 - deoxyglucose ( dg ) were purchased from sigma chemical ( st. louis , mo ) .
pheophorbide a ( pha ) and fumitremorgin c ( ftc ) were kind gifts obtained from dr. susan bates ( national cancer institute , nih , bethesda , md , usa ) .
2.2 .
cell culture and growth conditions human colon carcinoma hct - 116 , and s1 and its abcg2 - overexpressing resistant s1m1 - 80 cell lines were kindly provided by dr. susan bates ( national cancer institute , nih , usa ) .
s1 and s1m1 - 80 have been described previously [ 9 ] .
the resistant s1m1 - 80 subline used in this study was derived from the s1 clone of the ls174 human colon cancer cell line by prolonged selection in mitoxantrone , which was routinely maintained at 80 mum mitoxantrone .
there is no amplification of the abcg2 gene in s1m1 - 80 .
the abcg2 - mediated drug resistance in s1m1 - 80 is believed to be contributed by a balanced t ( 4,7 ) translocation downstream of the abcg2 gene [ 10 ] and the escape from mir - 519c repression by a shortening of its 3'untranslated region [ 11 ] .
at the time of investigation , it has been allowed to grow in drug - free medium for at least 3 weeks .
the cell lines were maintained in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 units / ml streptomycin sulfate , and 100 units / ml penicillin g sulfate , and incubated at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 .
hypoxic incubation was accomplished by using the bactron anaerobe system ( sheldon manufacturing inc. , cornelius , or , usa ) as previously described [ 12 ] .
prior to hypoxic incubation , the culture was replenished with fresh complete medium and the cells were then subjected to 3 cycles of evacuation refilling of anaerobic gas ( 90 % nitrogen and 10 % co2 ) .
the hypoxic environment was proved to be radiobiologic hypoxic ( oer = 3.0 , data not shown ) .
to mimic glucose depletion , cells were cultured in glucose - free rpmi 1640 medium for 16 h or in regular medium but in the presence of 20 mm 2 - deoxyglucose ( 2 - dg ) for 16 h. under these conditions , no significant cell death was observed .
to test the effect of acid , the glucose - containing culture medium was titrated with 0.1 m hcl to ph 5 .
in order to ensure that any observed change in the transporter expression was not attributed by a change in medium osmolality , control cells were also grown in glucose - containing rpmi - 1640 with an added volume of distilled water to achieve an osmolality equivalent to the acid - treated medium (~ 20 % v / v of added water ) .
2.3 .
reverse transcription and quantitative real - time pcr .
total rna was isolated using the trizol regent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) .
rna ( 1 mug ) was reverse transcribed using the transcriptor high fidelity cdna synthesis kit ( roche applied science , indianapolis , in ) .
quantitative real - time pcr was performed to quantify the change of abcg2 or pgk1 transcript expressions using the kapa sybr fast qpcr kit ( kapabiosystems , woburn , ma ) in a lightcycler 480 instrument i ( roche applied science , indianapolis , in ) .
the human gapdh rna was amplified in parallel as the internal control .
the specific primers used are as follows : abcg2 ( forward ) 5 ' - tttccaagcgttcattcaaaaa - 3 ' ( reverse ) 5 ' - tacgactgtgacaatgatctgagc - 3 ' ; pgk1 ( forward ) 5 ' - tttctaacaagctgacgctg - 3 ' , ( reverse ) 5 ' - ttcttcctccacatgaaagc - 3 ' ; gapdh ( forward ) 5 ' - agccacatcgctcagacac - 3 ' ( reverse ) 5 ' - gttcaaacttctgctcctga - 3 ' .
pcrs were performed at 95degreesc for 5 min , followed by 50 cycles of 95degreesc for 10 s and 60degreesc for 10 s. fluorescence signal was acquired at the end of the elongation step of every pcr cycle ( 72degreesc for 10 s ) to monitor the increasing amount of amplified dna .
deltact was calculated by subtracting the ct of gapdh from the ct of the transcript under investigation .
deltadeltact was then calculated by subtracting the deltact of the untreated cells ( or parental cells ) from the deltact of the treated cells ( or resistant cells ) .
fold change of gene expression was calculated by the equation 2 - deltadeltact .
2.4 .
rna interference a small interference hairpin - loop ( sh ) silencing vector against the human abcg2 ( pu6 - abcg2 ) and a negative control shrna vector targeting firefly luciferase ( pu6 - luc ) were prepared as described in to et al .
[ 13 ] .
s1 and s1m1 - 80 cells were transfected with pu6 - luc or pu6 - abcg2 using lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen , grand island , ny ) .
silencing efficiency was assessed by rt - pcr and immunoblot analysis .
2.5 .
luciferase reporter assay a series of human abcg2 promoter constructs with progressive deletions at the 5 ' - end has been described previously [ 14 ] .
the abcg2 promoter / firefly luciferase fusion genes ( 400 ng dna ) were transfected in hct - 116 or s1 cells on 24 - well plates using fugene 6 ( roche , indianapolis , in ) .
the pgl3 - basic ( promoterless ) plasmid , encoding firefly luciferase ( promega , madison , wi ) , was used to determine the basal levels .
in each experiment , the phrg - basic plasmid ( 100 ng ) , encoding renilla luciferase ( promega ) , was cotransfected for normalization purposes .
luminescence was measured 48 h after transfection using the dual - luciferase reporter assay system ( promega ) with the glomax 20 / 20 luminometer ( promega ) .
in experiments involving 2 - dg or hypoxic treatment , the cells were treated at 24 h after transfection for 16 h. reporter activity was normalized by calculating the ratio of firefly / renilla values .
results were expressed as mean +/ - sd of duplicate measurements from three independent transfections .
2.6 .
abcg2 transport activity by flow cytometry the abcg2 - mediated efflux activity in hct - 116 , s1 and s1m1 - 80 cells with or without pretreatment with 2 - dg or hypoxia were determined by flow cytometric assays as described previously [ 13 ] .
trypsinized cells was incubated in 1 mum pha with or without 10 mum abcg2 - specific inhibitor ftc in complete medium ( phenol red - free rpmi 1640 with 10 % fbs ) at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 for 30 min .
subsequently , the cells were washed with cold complete medium and then incubated for 1 h at 37degreesc in pha - free medium continuing with ftc to generate the ftc / efflux histogram , or without ftc to generate the efflux histogram .
the ftc - inhibitable pha efflux was determined as the difference in mean fluorescence intensity ( deltamfi ) between the ftc / efflux and efflux histograms , which indicates the abcg2 - mediated transport activity .
cells were finally washed with cold dulbecco 's pbs and placed on ice in the dark until analysis by flow cytometry .
to measure the cell surface abcg2 expression , trypsinized cells were incubated in 2 % bovine serum albumin / dulbecco 's pbs with either phycoerythrin - conjugated anti - abcg2 antibody 5d3 ( ebioscience , san diego , ca ) or phycoerythrin - conjugated mouse igg2b negative control antibody ( ebioscience ) according to manufacturer 's instructions for 30 min at room temperature .
the cells were then washed with dulbecco 's pbs and subsequently analyzed .
surface expression of abcg2 was calculated as the difference in mean channel numbers between the 5d3 antibody histogram and the negative control antibody histograms .
samples were analyzed on an lsrfortessa cell analyzer ( bd biosciences , san jose , ca ) .
phycoerythrin fluorescence was detected with a 488 nm argon laser and a 585 nm bandpass - filter , whereas pha fluorescence was detected with a 488 nm argon laser and a 670 nm bandpass filter .
at least 10,000 events were collected for all flow cytometry studies .
cell debris was eliminated by gating on forward versus side scatter and dead cells were excluded based on propidium iodide staining .
all assays were performed in three independent experiments .
2.7 .
growth inhibition assay growth inhibitory effect of mitoxantrone and cisplatin ( representing a typical abcg2 substrate and nonsubstrate , resp. ) , with or without the pretreatment of 2 - dg or hypoxia , on hct - 116 , s1 and s1m1 - 80 cells , were evaluated by the sulforhodamine b assay [ 15 ] .
cells were seeded into 96 - well microtitre plates in 100 mul at a plating density of 5,000 cells / well and allowed to incubate overnight .
the cells were then exposed to 2 - dg ( 20 mm ) or hypoxia for 16 h , before being treated with mitoxantrone or cisplatin at a range of concentrations and allowed to incubate at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 for another 72 h. each drug concentration was tested in quadruplicate and controls were tested in replicates of eight .
each experiment was carried out independently at least three times .
to determine whether differences between ic50 values were significant , the student 's t - test was performed with p < 0.05 being considered significant .
2.8 .
soft agar colony formation assay soft agar plates were prepared in six - well plates with a bottom layer of 0.6 % noble agar in serum - free rpmi 1640 .
1,000 cells , with or without a 24 h hypoxia treatment , were suspended in 0.3 % noble agar in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and seeded onto the bottom layer .
plates were then incubated for 3 weeks in a 37degreesc incubator .
the number of colonies was counted after staining with 0.05 % crystal violet for 1 h .
3. results 3.1 .
glucose depletion , decreased extracellular ph , and hypoxia upregulate abcg2 transcript level the abcg2 mrna expression was evaluated in three human colon carcinoma cell lines ( hct - 116 , s1 and its resistant subline s1m1 - 80 ) after the pretreatment with glucose depletion , 2 - dg , acidic ph and hypoxia .
in hct - 116 and s1 , a small but significant upregulation of abcg2 ( 2 to 4 - fold ) was observed under most of these conditions ( figure 1 , upper panel ) .
acidic ph did not significantly change abcg2 level in s1 cells .
since the effect was more pronounced after 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment , these conditions were selected for later functional and more detailed mechanistic studies .
on the other hand , abcg2 mrna expression was not changed in the resistant s1m1 - 80 cells .
the expression of pgk1 , a hypoxia responsive gene , was also measured to verify the hypoxia treatment .
our data indicates that pgk1 was remarkably induced by the hypoxia treatment in all three cell lines ( figure 1 , lower panel ) .
the increase in abcg2 mrna after 2 - dg or hypoxia treatment was blocked by actinomycin d ( 5 mug / ml ; data not shown ) , suggesting that these tumor microenvironment conditions regulate abcg2 mrna levels through an effect on abcg2 transcription .
3.2 .
a cis - element close to the reported hif - 1alpha response element at the abcg2 promoter is required for the upregulation of abcg2 after 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment a series of 5 ' - deletion reporter gene constructs harboring the abcg2 promoter region with the 3 ' end terminating at + 396 bp were used to elucidate the promoter region responsible for glucose depletion or hypoxia - mediated abcg2 upregulation ( figure 2 ( b )) [ 14 ] .
after transiently transfected into hct - 116 and s1 cells , all the abcg2 promoter - luciferase constructs demonstrated good activities above the promoter - less pgl3 - - basic background ( data for hct - 116 and s1 are shown in figure 2 ( b ) and supplementary figure 1 ( available online at doi : 10.5402 / 2012 / 746025 ) , resp. ) .
while reporter activity of the full length abcg2 promoter construct ( - 1662 /+ 396 ) and the longer ones ( - 628 and - 312 /+ 396 ) were found to be activated in hct - 116 and s1 pretreated with 2 - dg or hypoxia , the activation was abolished in the shortest construct ( - 105 /+ 396 ) .
the data implies that the region between - 312 and - 105 , harboring two reported hif - 1alpha response elements [ 3 ] ( figure 2 ( a )) , is responsible for the observed induction of abcg2 transcription .
3.3 .
2 - dg and hypoxia treatment increased abcg2 - mediated drug efflux and reduced cytotoxic effects of abcg2 substrate drugs the upregulation of abcg2 observed above suggested that all of the tumor microenvironment conditions investigated may confer a more drug - resistant phenotype .
next we sought to demonstrate the functional evidence with special regard to drug efflux activity and in vitro drug response. by flow cytometric analysis , both 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment led to a small but statistically significant elevation of abcg2 - mediated drug efflux ( deltamfi = signal between the efflux and ftc / efflux histograms ) in all cell lines tested ( figure 3 ) .
since the basal abcg2 levels in s1 and hct - 116 cells are very low , we did not proceed to measure the protein expression either by western blot or surface staining by flow cytometry .
nonetheless and more importantly , 2 - dg and hypoxia were found to significantly decrease the cytotoxic effect of the abcg2 substrate anticancer drug ( mitoxantrone ) ( table 1 ) .
on the other hand , the cytotoxicity of cisplatin was not affected , indicating the specific effect of these tumor microenvironment conditions on abcg2 - mediated mdr ( table 1 ) .
in the abcg2 - overexpressing resistant s1m1 - 80 cells , western blot and flow cytometry - based cell surface staining analysis were also performed because abcg2 protein level is readily detectable .
interestingly , by both assays , abcg2 protein expression was also found to be induced slightly after 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment ( figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b )) .
in figure 4 ( b ) ( flow cytometry cell surface staining ) , the deltachannel # between the specific anti - abcg2 staining and the isotype antibody control represents the cell surface abcg2 protein expression .
importantly , this slight induction of abcg2 protein by 2 - dg and hypoxia was also found to decrease the cytotoxic effect of mitoxantrone ( an abcg2 substrate anticancer drug ) ( table 1 ) , probably through enhancing the abcg2 efflux activity ( figure 3 ) .
in an attempt to further understand the induction of abcg2 protein expression by the 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment , cycloheximide chase assay was performed to evaluate the degradation rate of abcg2 protein ( data not shown ) .
unfortunately , abcg2 protein was found to be fairly stable and no appreciable degradation was observed with or without the 2 - dg or hypoxia treatment after up to 36 h .
3.4 .
2 - dg and hypoxia enhanced the anchorage independent cell growth in soft agar colony formation assay anchorage - independent growth is one of the hallmarks of cell transformation , which is considered a reliable in vitro assay for detecting malignant transformation of cells .
since abcg2 upregulation was observed after 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment and that abcg2 - mediated mdr may lead to a more malignant phenotype , the colony formation capability of s1 and s1m180 cells with or without 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment was assessed .
in both cell lines , hypoxia was found to significantly increase the colony formation capability ( figure 5 ( b )) .
in s1m1 - 80 cells , 2 - dg treatment was also found to enhance the tendency to form colony in a statistical significant manner .
interestingly , the colony formation capability could be abolished when abcg2 was knocked down in the cells ( figures 5 ( a ) and 5 ( b )) .
4. discussion the concept of tumor microenvironment is gaining a lot of attention in recent years because it allows complex interaction between a tumor and its surrounding normal cells , molecules , and blood vessels , which all participate in tumor progression [ 16 ] .
a tumor can change its microenvironment and the microenvironment can affect the way the tumor grows and spreads .
hypoxia , glucose deprivation , and acidosis are generally considered as the hallmarks of the tumor microenvironment .
while chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment strategy for cancer , drug resistance is seriously hindering the clinical efficacy of most anticancer drugs .
solid tumors exhibit distinct structural abnormalities such as the leaky vasculature and thus have poor tissue perfusion , subsequently leading to physiological resistance to anticancer drugs .
on the other hand , resistant cancer cells often express high levels of the multidrug resistance ( mdr ) transporters as their biochemical mechanism of drug resistance .
the mdr transporters are efflux transporters on cell surface .
they make use of the energy derived from atp hydrolysis to regulate intracellular drug concentration , thereby determining cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents .
abcg2 is one of these transporters , conferring mdr to a broad spectrum of antitumor agents. with high normal tissue expression in the brain endothelium , gastrointestinal tract , and placenta , abcg2 is believed to be important in the protection from xenobiotics , regulating oral bioavailability , forming part of the blood - brain barrier , and the maternal - fetal barrier .
importantly , abcg2 may also contribute to the maintenance of stem or progenitor cells as a survival factor .
among the various conditions within the tumor microenvironment , hypoxia has been demonstrated to upregulate abcg2 in a mouse progenitor cell model [ 3 ] .
this study attempted to understand the regulation of abcg2 by the various adverse growth conditions within the tumor microenvironment in colon carcinoma cell lines .
in fact , it has been postulated that the atp - dependent drug efflux may be reduced under hypoxic condition .
cells are known to switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism under hypoxia and glycolytic pathway is less efficient in generating atp [ 17 ] .
to this end , it has been shown that a limitation in atp supply ( by sodium azide or 2 - dg ) could inhibit daunorubicin efflux in a non - pgp - overexpressing resistant cell line [ 18 ] .
xu et al. demonstrated that the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration leads to an increase in the cytotoxic efficacy of various chemotherapeutic drugs as a result of a reduced p - gp activity which was attributed to a depletion of atp [ 19 ] .
on the other hand , it has been shown that acidosis ( especially together with hypoxia ) could increase p - gp - mediated drug efflux and lead to reduced cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs [ 20 ] .
the discrepancy between the studies may be caused by the different cell lines used and different extent of hypoxia treatment .
our study focused on abcg2 , which is a more recently discovered mdr transporter .
the data revealed that hypoxia , glucose deprivation , and acidosis can all upregulate abcg2 in the two parental colon cancer cell lines ( figure 1 ) and apparently leading to multidrug resistance ( table 1 ) .
the upregulation is likely mediated at the transcription level because it can be abolished by pretreatment with actinomycin d , which inhibits rna synthesis ( data not shown ) .
the effect on an abcg2 - overexpressing resistant s1m1 - 80 cell line was much less pronounced at the rna level ( figure 1 ) .
however and interestingly , the resistance level was further enhanced in s1m1 - 80 cells after 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment ( table 1 ) .
this effect may have been mediated at the protein level ( see below ) .
since hypoxic condition will commit the cells to glycolytic metabolism , a downstream glycolytic gene ( pgk1 ) was also evaluated in our study ( figure 1 ) as a surrogate for the hypoxic treatment and to demonstrate the functional linkage with glucose metabolism .
as expected , pgk1 level was elevated remarkably after the hypoxia treatment .
to evaluate the effect of glucose depletion , cells were grown either in glucose - free medium or in glucose - containing medium supplemented with 2 - dg .
2 - dg is a glucose analogue , which acts as a competitive inhibitor of glucose metabolism [ 21 ] , where 2 - dg competes with d - glucose to be transferred to the cells as a target for the hexokinase in the first step of the glycolytic pathway .
upon transport into the cells , glucose and 2 - dg are phosphorylated to glucose - po4 and 2 - dg - po4 , respectively , by the hexokinase .
however , unlike glucose - po4 , the 2 - dg - po4 cannot further be metabolized by the glucose phosphate isomerase ( gpi ) .
in addition , 2 - dg could inhibit gpi [ 22 ] , and then downregulate its downstream glycolysis - related genes ( such as pgk1 ) , which agree well with our findings ( figure 1 ) .
regarding the effect of acidosis , the upregulation of abcg2 was only statistically significant in hct - 116 cells .
since abcg2 upregulation is more pronounced after 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment , further mechanistic and functional studies were performed under these conditions. by reporter gene assay , the abcg2 promoter region ( - 312 to - 105 ) close to the reported hif - 1alpha response element was found to be required for our observed gene upregulation ( figure 2 ( b )) .
consistent with the reduced response of cells to abcg2 substrate anticancer drug ( table 1 ) after 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment , abcg2 efflux activity was found to be increased in all cell lines tested by the flow cytometry ( figure 3 ) .
since mdr is usually mediated by overexpression of the mdr transporters , we intentionally investigated how abcg2 regulation is affected by 2 - dg and hypoxia in the abcg2 - overexpressing resistant s1m1 - 80 cell line .
s1m1 - 80 has massive abcg2 overexpression probably caused by a genetic translocation [ 10 ] and its escape from mir - 519c repression [ 11 ] reported previously .
abcg2 protein expression was detected by western blot analysis and cell surface staining. by both assays , 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment were found to increase abcg2 level ( figure 4 ) , which is consistent with the elevated efflux activity ( figure 3 ) and reduced response to abcg2 substrate anticancer drug ( table 1 ) .
note that the massively overexpressed abcg2 transcript level in s1m1 - 80 was not significantly affected by these treatments ( table 1 ) ; therefore , the observed functional effect may have been caused by modulation at the posttranscriptional and / or translational levels .
this piece of data is important because it suggests that tumor microenvironment could coordinately regulate abcg2 with preexisting mdr mechanisms to attain a higher resistance level .
the ability of cancer cells to form colonies in vitro in an anchorage - independent manner is commonly used as a measure of their malignancy .
after 2 - dg and hypoxia treatment , both s1 and s1m1 - 80 cells were found to form more colonies in a soft agar colony formation assay ( figure 5 ) .
the upregulation of abcg2 may play a specific role in this enhanced colony formation capability because genetic knockdown of abcg2 was found to significantly reduce the number of colonies formed ( figure 5 ) .
taken together , the three adverse growth conditions in the tumor microenvironment tested were found to upregulate abcg2 to mediate multidrug resistance , with the possible enhancing effect on preexisting mdr mechanism , and to give rise to a more malignant phenotype .
novel clinical interventions may be devised to help circumvent this abcg2 - mediated resistance by modulating the tumor microenvironment .

16 h treatment was selected because hif - 1alpha induction was found to reach the maximum after exposure to 16 h hypoxia treatment ( data not shown ) .
expression of pgk1 , a hypoxia response gene , was also measured to indicate the activation of the glycolytic pathway by hypoxia .
mrna expressions were normalized with gapdh .
results for each gene are expressed relative to that in the untreated cells ( 2 - dg = 2 - deoxyglucose ) .
mean +/ - sd from three independent experiments is shown .
the student 's t - test was used to compare the gene expression between the cells with or without the various treatment (* p < 0.05 ) .
abcg2 mrna expression was not affected significantly after the various treatments in s1m1 - 80 cells .
figure 2 abcg2 promoter luciferase reporter gene assay showing that the promoter region harboring the hif - 1alpha response element is required for the activation of abcg2 in s1 human colon cancer cell line .
similar results were also obtained for hct - 116 , which are shown in supplementary figure 1 .
( a ) schematic representations of the various 5 ' deleted abcg2 - promoter constructs .
the 5 ' - end of each of the constructs relative to the transcription start site ( arrows ) is indicated .
the pgl3 - basic ( promoterless ) vector , encoding firefly luciferase , was used to determine the basal levels .
the last construct ( - 105 /+ 396 ) does not contain the hif - 1alpha response element .
( b ) abcg2 reporter activity was measured in s1 cells transiently transfected with the various abcg2 promoter constructs with or without 24 h pretreatment with 2 - dg ( 20 mm ) or hypoxia .
the mean reporter activity +/ - sd ( firefly / renilla luciferase units ( rlu )) from three independent experiments is presented .
figure 3 drug efflux assay showing the upregulation of abcg2 - mediated drug efflux in hct - 116 , s1 and s1m1 - 80 cells after a 16 h pretreatment with 2 - dg ( 20 mm ) or hypoxia .
deltamfi was determined as the difference in mean fluorescence intensity between the ftc / efflux and efflux histograms , which indicates the abcg2 - mediated transport activity .
* p < 0.05 , significantly different from the untreated hct - 116 , s1 , s1m1 - 80 cells , respectively .
figure 4 western blot analysis and flow cytometric assay showing a slight elevation of abcg2 surface expression by 2 - dg and hypoxic treatment in s1m1 - 80 cells .

( b ) flow cytometry - based cell surface abcg2 staining .
s1m1 - 80 cells were exposed to 2 - dg ( 20 mm ) or hypoxia for 16 h , after which they were incubated with anti - abcg2 antibody ( 5d3 ) ( denoted by the solid black line ) or a negative control antibody ( denoted by the grey - filled histogram ) .
fluorescence was then determined by flow cytometry .
deltachannel # represents the difference in fluorescence signal between the specific abcg2 antibody staining and the isotype antibody control .
representative histograms from one of three independent experiments are shown .
figure 5 soft agar colony formation assay showing the increased tendency of s1 or s1m1 - 80 cells to form anchorage - independent colonies after a 3 - week incubation , which was abolished by knocking down abcg2 by silencing vector .
( a ) silencing efficacy of the abcg2 shrna as revealed by western blot analysis .
abcg2 protein expression was decreased by ~ 50 % in the shrna - transfected s1m1 - 80 cells .
( b ) relative no. of colonies formed in s1 or s1m1 - 80 cells after the indicated treatment .
* p < 0.05 , compared with the no - treatment group .

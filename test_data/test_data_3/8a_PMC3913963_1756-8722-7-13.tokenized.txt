infantile hemangioma ( ih ) , which is the most common tumor in infants , is a benign vascular neoplasm resulting from the abnormal proliferation of endothelial cells and pericytes .
for nearly a century , researchers have noted that ih exhibits diverse and often dramatic clinical behaviors .
on the one hand , most lesions pose no threat or potential for complication and resolve spontaneously without concern in most children with ih. on the other hand , approximately 10 % of ihs are destructive , disfiguring and even vision - or life - threatening .
recent studies have provided some insight into the pathogenesis of these vascular tumors , leading to a better understanding of the biological features of ih and , in particular , indicating that during hemangioma neovascularization , two main pathogenic mechanisms prevail , angiogenesis and vasculogenesis .
both mechanisms have been linked to alterations in several important cellular signaling pathways .
these pathways are of interest from a therapeutic perspective because targeting them may help to reverse , delay or prevent hemangioma neovascularization .
in this review , we explore some of the major pathways implicated in ih , including the vegf / vegfr , notch , beta - adrenergic , tie2 / angiopoietins , pi3k / akt / mtor , hif - alpha - mediated and pdgf / pdgf - r - beta pathways .
we focus on the role of these pathways in the pathogenesis of ih , how they are altered and the consequences of these abnormalities .
in addition , we review the latest preclinical and clinical data on the rationally designed targeted agents that are now being directed against some of these pathways .
infantile hemangioma neovascularization angiogenesis vasculogenesis background infantile hemangioma ( ih ) is a common disorder in infancy , with an estimated prevalence of 5 to 10 % .
if left untreated , these tumors are characterized by a rapid growth phase during the first year of life , followed by slow involution , which may continue until the age of 10 - 12 years ( figure 1 ) [ 1,2 ] .
however , some ihs will leave residual changes , such as telangiectasias , fibro - fatty tissue , scars , excessive atrophic skin and pigment changes .
in 10 % of cases , ihs grow dramatically and destroy tissue , impair function or even threaten life [ 3 ] .
the standard treatment options for ih include corticosteroids or surgical excision , and the options in life - or sight - threatening cases include treatment with vincristine , interferon or cyclophosphamide .
unfortunately , none of these therapeutic modalities are ideal due to restrictions or potential serious side effects [ 4 - 7 ] .
beta - blockers have recently been introduced as a safe and effective treatment for ih [ 8 - 11 ] .
however , their use is not without risk , and not all tumors respond to these drugs [ 12,13 ] .
these issues have spurred extensive research to clarify the signaling pathways implicated in hemangioma neovascularization in the hope that a greater understanding of its molecular pathogenesis will reveal new strategies to tackle ih. figure 1 hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) stained sections of proliferating , involuting and involuted phases of ih. the proliferating phase is characterized by densely packed tumor cells that form immature vessels ( a ) .
in the involuting phase , disorganized vasculature consists of flat endothelium and pericytes ( b ) .
the tumor is replaced by fat and / or connective tissues in the involuted phase ( c ) .
scale bar = 100 mum .
the initial histochemical work of mulliken and glowacki [ 14 ] , examining endothelial cell ( ec ) morphology , shed light on the cellular components of ih. in the past decade , hemangioma - derived progenitor / stem cells ( hemscs ) , mesenchymal stem cells ( hem - mscs ) , endothelial progenitor cells ( hemepcs ) , ecs ( hemecs ) and perivascular cells ( hem - pericytes ) , all of which comprise the ih , have been isolated ( table 1 ) [ 15 - 18 ] .
in general , cd133 was used as a stem cell biomarker for the isolation of hemscs from ih tissues .
hemepcs were purified from hemscs based on expression of the ec marker cd31 .
in contrast , hem - mscs did n't express cd31 or cd34 .
in ih tissues , cd133 expression was found to be located in both perivascular region and endothelium [ 19 ] .
therefore , hemscs may contain both of hem - mscs and hemepcs .
studies from different groups have demonstrated that hemscs have the ability to self - renew and can differentiate into endothelium , adipocytes and pericytes in vitro [ 15,20 ] .
when implanted subcutaneously into nude mice , hemscs can produce human glucose transporter - 1 ( glut - 1 ) positive microvessels at 7 - 14 days [ 15,20 - 22 ] .

* cd133 , a pentaspan membrane protein , is used as a stem cell biomarker for the isolation of progenitor / stem - like cells from ih tissues .
cd133 is also responsible for self - renewal , tumorigenesis , metabolism , differentiation , autophagy , apoptosis and regeneration [ 23 ] .
however , little is known about its biological functions in the development of ih. we now recognize that ih may be not only a disorder of angiogenesis ( i.e. , the sprouting of new vessels from existing ones ) but also - at least in part - a disorder of vasculogenesis ( i.e. , the de novo formation of new blood vessels from stem cells ) [ 20,24,25 ] .
improved knowledge of the signaling pathways that regulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis has led to the identification of several possible therapeutic targets that have driven the development of molecularly targeted therapies .
because many of the signaling pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of various tumor types , insight gained from these studies will enable the development of target - specific drugs , not only for ih but also for malignant vascular tumors .
this review will highlight the most important of these findings .
although the signaling pathways involved in the development of ih are described separately below , there are numerous interactions among them , indirectly reflecting the complexity of ih pathogenesis .
vegf / vegfr pathway the human vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) family consists of vegf - a , vegf - b , vegf - c , vegf - d and placental growth factor ( pigf ) .
these growth factors play pivotal roles in embryonic development and angiogenesis - dependent disease [ 26 ] .
many reports have confirmed that excessive vegf expression in ih tissue parallels the proliferating phase of its growth .
conversely , in the involuting phase , vegf expression rapidly decreases , and many angiogenesis inhibitors become prominent [ 21,27,28 ] .
the functions of the different vegf family members are determined by their receptor specificity .
two receptors for vegf are members of the tyrosine - kinase family and conserved in ecs .
these vegf receptors ( vegfr ) are vegfr - flt - 1 ( vegfr - 1 ) and vegfr - flk - 1 / kdr ( vegfr - 2 ) .
vegfr - 1 and vegfr - 2 are located on ecs , bone - marrow derived hematopoietic cells and tumor cells , etc .
[ 26,29 ] .
the expression of these receptors is low in normal tissues and only upregulated during the development of those pathological states when neovascularization occurs [ 30 ] .
another receptor , vegfr - 3 , is primarily expressed in lymph nodes and tumor blood vessels [ 31,32 ] .
neuropilin - 1 and neuropilin - 2 were discovered as coreceptors that that enhanced the binding and effectiveness of the vegf stimulation of their receptors [ 33 ] .
upregulated autocrine vegf - a / vegfr - 2 loop in hemec one of the most intensely studied factors involved in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis is vegf - a. vegfr - 2 is known to mediate the majority of the downstream angiogenic effects of vegf - a , including microvascular permeability , ec proliferation , migration and survival [ 34 ] .
upon the activation of vegfr - 2 in ecs , three major secondary messenger pathways trigger multiple downstream signals that promote angiogenesis .
these pathways are the following : the mitogen - activated protein / erk kinase ( mek )/ extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) cascade , the phosphatidylinostitol - 3 kinase ( pi3k )/ serine - threonine protein kinase / akt cascade and the phospholipase c - gamma / intracellular ca2 +/( protein kinase c ( pkc ) cascade [ 35,36 ] .
the genetic deletion of vegf - a or its primary signaling receptor vegfr - 2 results in early embryonic lethality , associated with a near - complete block of hematopoietic and vascular development [ 37 ] .
high - vegfr - 2 cells are well documented to exhibit a higher capacity of self - renewal and superior growth in vitro and in vivo compared with a low - vegfr - 2 cell population [ 33,38 ] .
hemecs demonstrate the phenotype of a constitutively active autocrine vegf - a / vegfr - 2 loop ( figure 2 ) , which renders the cells more sensitive to paracrine / external stimulation by vegf - a and results in the increased proliferation and migration of cells and tumor formation [ 39,40 ] .
these characteristics likely result from the genetic instability of hemecs as somatic missense mutations in the kinase insert of the vegfr - 2 gene have been found in ihs [ 41 ] .
in addition , imbalances in gene expression have been reported in mesenchymal compartments compared to normal tissues , suggesting a possible reciprocal interaction between hemecs and the surrounding cells [ 42 - 44 ] .
alternatively , hemecs may originate from progenitor / stem - like cells , which are known to display robust proliferative and clonogenic capabilities and to express high levels of vegf - a [ 15,21 ] .
the expression level of vegf is also increased in hemecs , although this increase is not dramatic [ 40 ] .
finally , cosmc was reported to be overexpressed in proliferating ihs , with an association with the enhanced vegf - mediated phosphorylation of vegfr - 2 and its downstream signaling [ 45 ] .
figure 2 the vegf signaling pathway in hemecs and hemscs .
upon ligand binding , vegf receptors dimerize , leading to the phosphorylation of different tyrosine residues .
phosphorylation in turn elicits differential downstream signaling events .
the abnormal activation of vegfr - 2 on the cell surface may also be beneficial to the survival of hemecs as vegf - a plays a critical role in protecting ecs against apoptotic cell death [ 46,47 ] .
in addition , this inhibition of ec apoptosis can improve angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in patients with ischemia [ 30 ] .
we recently indicated that maintaining bcl - 2 expression via vegf - a / vegfr - 2 signaling in primary hemecs blocked the cells from apoptotic death in the absence of external vegf - a. moreover , the inactivation of pi3k / akt suppressed the vegf - a / vegfr - 2 - mediated anti - apoptotic effect and unleashed the inhibitory effect of vegf - a / vegfr - 2 signaling over the reduction of bcl - 2 expression , thereby amplifying the activation of the caspase cascade [ 48 ] .
these findings suggest that hemecs may be able to adapt to the abnormal physical environment of the tumor by undergoing a form of reprogramming that involves an increase in apoptosis resistance and by up - regulating a vegf autocrine survival feedback loop to sustain these effects and stabilize the aberrant phenotype .
moreover , recent research efforts revealed that pericytes , in addition to producing vegf - a that acts in a paracrine fashion ( figure 3 ) , can stimulate the autocrine expression of vegf - a by tumor ecs , both of which could lead to a general suppression of ec apoptosis [ 49 ] .
interestingly , hemscs and hem - pericytes also secrete high levels of the angiogenic vegf - a [ 21,42 ] .
thus , various combinations of strategies , including the development of novel potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors against vegfr - 2 and potential to abrogate its downstream pathways , can be investigated to achieve synergistic effects on hemec apoptosis and therefore on hemangioma regression .

discrepancy of vegfr - 1 signaling in hemscs and hemecs in contrast to other vegfr genes , vegfr - 1 expresses two types of mrna , one for a full - length receptor and another for a soluble short protein known as soluble vegfr - 1 ( sflt - 1 ) .
the binding - affinity of vegfr - 1 for vegf - a is one order of magnitude higher than that of vegfr - 2 , whereas the kinase activity of vegfr - 1 is about ten - fold weaker than that of vegfr - 2 .
therefore , vegfr - 1 is considered a negative regulator of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis during development [ 50 ] .
vegfr - 1 - / - mice show an overabundance of blood vessels and overgrowth of immature ecs , similarly to those features observed in ih [ 51 ] .
a reduction of vegfr - 1 expression has been implicated in the proliferation of infantile hemecs and tissue [ 40,52 ] .
the mechanism for this low expression in hemecs was shown to be the sequestration of beta1 - inergrin in a multiprotein complex composed of tumor endothelial marker - 8 ( tem8 ) and vegfr - 2 , which inhibits nuclear factor in activated t cells ( nfat ) - mediated vegfr - 1 transcription [ 40 ] .
however , vegfr - 1 is relatively over - expressed in hemscs [ 53 ] .
the involvement of vegfr - 1 in the progression of ih could involve at least one mechanism : the activation of hemsc function , with a subsequent increase in vasculogenesis .
vegf - a , either endogenous or exogenous , significantly induces vegfr - 1 - mediated erk1 / 2 phosphorylation in hemscs and promotes the differentiation of hemscs to hemecs ( figure 2 ) .
moreover , vegf - b , which is the specific ligand for vegfr - 1 , is highly expressed in hemecs and induces similar effects [ 53 ] .
these results clearly indicate that not only the paracrine function of vegf - b from hemecs but also the persistent autocrine signaling through the vegf - a / vegfr - 1 loop in hemscs contributes to enhanced ih vasculogenesis in general .
notch pathway the notch pathway is a conserved ligand - receptor signaling mechanism that modulates cell fate and differentiation .
the interaction of notch receptors ( notch 1 to 4 ) with their ligands ( delta - like 1 , - 3 , - 4 , jagged - 1 and - 2 ) leads to the cleavage of the transmembrane notch receptor , giving rise to the notch intracellular domain ( nicd ) that migrates into the nucleus .
in the nucleus , the nicd associates with a transcription factor , recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa j ( rbp - jk ) , and activates transcription from the rbp - jk dna binding site .
the nicd - rbp - jk complex upregulates the expression of primary target genes of notch signaling , such as hairy and enhancer of split ( hes ) and hes - related protein ( herp / hey ) family of transcription factors [ 54,55 ] .
notch expression in ih although the expression levels of the notch components are likely dynamic during development , making transient expression difficult to detect , current data suggest that many known notch components , mainly two ligands ( delta - like - 4 and jagged - 1 ) , three receptors ( north - 1 , - 3 and - 4 ) and four effectors ( hes - 1 , hey1 , hey2 and heyl ) are involved in the pathogenesis of ih. both jagged - 1 and notch - 4 are increased in proliferating ihs .
all transcript levels of notch - 1 , notch - 3 , notch - 4 , jagged - 1 and delta - like - 4 ( dll4 ) were higher in the ih than in the placenta ( a commonly used tissue for comparisons ) .
conversely , notch - 2 is strongly decreased in both proliferating and involuting ihs [ 44,56 ] .
notch signaling triggers cell - cell interactions in ih notch signaling is initiated when the extracellular domain of the receptor engages ligands found on neighboring cells that are in close proximity to one another .
thus , notch signaling depends on cell - contact - dependent interactions .
in many cases , the cell that presents the ligand is a cell that does not have notch signaling present , thus distinguishing two neighboring cells into one with ligand with little notch signaling and one with receptor and high notch signaling [ 57 ] .
in a study by wu et al .
[ 44 ] , the investigators demonstrated that hemscs have distinct notch expression patterns from hemecs .
in hemscs , where notch3 is strongly expressed , hes1 , hey1 , and heyl were expressed at levels 10 to 100 times to that of hey - 2 .
in hemecs , however , notch - 1 , notch - 4 and jagged - 1 have higher expression levels .
hey - 2 proteins were often found to be expressed in hemecs .
however , hey - 2 was not uniformly present in all ecs , suggesting that only a subset of ih ecs express the notch target [ 56 ] .
these data suggest the possibility that the notch pathway might also contribute to establishing two distinct subpopulations at different steps of angiogenesis in ih , such as ecs versus smooth muscle cells ( smcs )/ pericytes , arteries versus veins and large vessels versus capillaries [ 54,58,59 ] .
we highlight the concept that ligand - receptor interactions in notch signaling depend on contact between two cells , which may be two different cell types .
notch ligands involved in ih angiogenesis may be presented by hemecs , pericytes or hemscs .
interestingly , research by boscolol et al .
[ 43 ] revealed that endothelial - derived jagged - 1 can induce hemscs to acquire a pericyte - like phenotype , which is a crucial step in the vasculogenesis of ih. disruption of the juxtacrine interaction between endothelial jagged - 1 and notch receptors on hemscs inhibited blood vessel formation in ih murine models .
however , mice homozygous for a null mutation of several components of the notch pathway , including notch - 1 and jagged - 1 , resulted in embryonic lethality with vascular remodeling defects .
vasculogenesis proceeded normally in these mutants , whereas the next step , angiogenesis , was disrupted [ 60,61 ] .
these data suggest that the upregulated jagged - 1 expression in the ih endothelium may provide a unique effect to control the vascular development of ih. is there a specific relationship between vegf and notch pathways in ih ?
in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed several ways in which the vegf and notch pathways interact .
particularly , vegf increases dll4 expression [ 62,63 ] .
dll4 is strongly expressed by the ecs of sprouting angiogenic vessels , which commonly respond to vegf signals .
there is evidence that the blockade of vegf in tumors results in a rapid decrease of dll4 expression in tumor ecs [ 64 ] .
interestingly , although hemecs had higher vegf - a levels and increased activation of vegfr - 2 compared with normal ecs [ 40 ] , the dll4 levels in hemecs were lower than those found in normal ecs [ 44 ] .
these data argue against the idea that vegf interacts with notch signaling in ih. however , several lines of evidence indicate otherwise .
for example , the disruption of dll4 or endothelium - specific loss of notch1 increases the superficial plexus vascular density and causes an excess of angiogenic sprouts .
this loss of notch signaling is associated with an increase in vegfr - 2 activity [ 57 ] .
other studies have suggested that reduced notch activity resulted in reduced vegfr - 1 expression and increased vegfr - 2 expression in cultured ecs [ 65,66 ] .
in addition , hellstrom et al .
[ 67 ] demonstrated that dll4 - notch signaling within the endothelial cell population serves to suppress the tip - cell phenotype .
the retinal vascular abnormalities in dll4 +/ - mice and after long - term treatment with gamma - secretase inhibitors might also result from changes in the pattern of vegf - a expression [ 67 ] .
in contrast to dll4 , jagged - 1 is proangiogenic protein that functions by downregulating dll4 - notch signaling .
jagged - 1 also counteracts dll4 - notch signaling interactions between stalk ecs , which helps to sustain elevated vegf receptor expression in the newly formed and therefore immature vascular plexus at the angiogenic front [ 68 ]. by analogy to studies of vegf signaling in hemecs , notch components may be novel regulators for vegf signaling in ih ( figure 4 ) .
figure 4 tip / stalk cell specification during spouting angiogenesis and vascular development .
angiogenic sprouts emerge from the newly formed vessels in response to pro - angiogenic cues , such as hypoxia - induced vegf .
vegf stimulus , acting via vegfr - 2 , increases the expression of dll4 on endothelial cells , which in turn activates notch receptors on adjacent endothelial cells .
furthermore , vegfrs are regulated by notch signaling , providing an additional feedback loop between the two pathways : activated notch receptors on ecs can positively regulate the expression of vegfr - 1 and vegfr - 3 in those cells .
in contrast , notch activation leads to the reduction of vegfr - 2 expression in cell culture and a concomitant decrease in the proangiogenic response to exogenous vegf .
both of these effects would likely lead to a lower migratory or proliferative response in connector cells that exhibit notch activation .
until now , the involvement of notch in ih development has remained poorly understood , and many issues still need to be addressed .
how does the notch pathway play a role in the interaction between hemecs and smcs / pericytes ?
how are the different roles that the notch pathway plays , such as arteriovenous patterning , tip cell differentiation and vessel wall formation , integrated during vascular development in ih ?
how do some of the key downstream notch target genes affect ih vessels in the presence of high vegf levels ? and finally , does the expression and / or activity of vegf components in ih depend on the nature of notch signaling or vice versa ?
these questions should be addressed by future research efforts .
beta - adrenergic signaling the beta - adrenergic receptors ( beta - ars ) , a family of g - protein - coupled receptors that are activated by beta - adrenergic agonists ( e.g. , epinephrine or norepinephrine ) , can initiate a series of signaling cascades , thereby leading to multiple , cell - specific responses ( figure 5 ) .
the ligation of beta - ars by beta - adrenergic agonists triggers a g - protein coupled signaling cascade that stimulates cyclic amp ( camp ) synthesis .
this secondary messenger , camp , regulates many cellular functions through its effectors , such as camp - dependent protein kinase ( pka ) and epac ( exchange proteins directly activated by camp ) [ 69 - 71 ] .
preclinical studies have demonstrated that beta - adrenergic signaling can regulate multiple fundamental biological processes underlying the progression and metastasis of tumors , including the promotion of inflammation [ 72 - 74 ] , angiogenesis [ 75 - 78 ] , migration [ 79 ] , invasion [ 80,81 ] and resistance to programmed cell death [ 82 - 85 ] .
some evidence suggests that the stimulation of beta - adrenergic signaling can also inhibit dna damage repair and the cellular immune response [ 86,87 ] and promote surgery - induced metastasis [ 88,89 ] .
these findings have led to the hypothesis that commonly prescribed beta - blockers may favorably impact cancer progression and metastasis in patients [ 90 ] .
figure 5 beta - adrenergic signaling modulates multiple cellular processes in tumor progression and metastasis .
the ligation of beta - ars by epinephrine or norepinephrine triggers a g - protein coupled signaling cascade that stimulates camp synthesis .
camp activates the pka protein , which can mediate multiple signal pathways via the phosphorylation of various downstream signal proteins .
in another major pathway , the camp activation of epac leads to the rap1a - mediated activation of raf / mapk signaling pathways and downstream effects on diverse cellular processes .
in the six years since june 2008 when leaute - labreze et al .
[ 11 ] first described their serendipitous observation of the anti - proliferative effect of propranolol on severe ihs , many articles regarding beta - blocker therapy for ihs have been published [ 8,10,91 ] .
however , despite the apparent widespread use of beta - blockers , their mechanism of action in ihs has not yet been elucidated .
agonists and antagonists of beta - ars are known to act antithetically via the same intracellular pathways [ 92 ] .
given that the expression of all three beta - ars has been demonstrated in ih tumors [ 93 - 96 ] , does beta - adrenergic signaling play a role in the pathogenesis of ih ?
this hypothesis was immediately and , to some degree , indirectly testable by mayer et al .
[ 97 ] , who found that intrauterine exposure to beta2 - sympathomimetic hexoprenaline can increase the occurrence of ih in preterm infants , suggesting a role for beta - ar stimulation in the initiation of ih. furthermore , we recently demonstrated that the activation of beta - ars resulted in increased hemec proliferation and upregulation of the erk signaling cascade .
vegfr - 2 - mediated erk signaling was also upregulated upon beta - ar activation to mediate the proliferation of hemecs [ 96 ] .
these findings unveil a functional connection between the beta - ars and ih development .
however , confirmatory studies in animal models of ih and mechanistic studies are needed to clearly define the role of beta - adrenergic signaling in the growth and involution of ih [ 98 ] .
tie - 2 / angiopoietin signaling tie - 2 and the angiopoietins ( ang ) , another receptor - ligand system involved in physiological and pathogenic angiogenesis , have also been reported to be associated with the development of ihs .
tie - 2 tyrosine kinase receptor is expressed specifically on vascular ecs and on a certain subtype of macrophages implicated in angiogenesis .
ang - 1 and ang - 2 have been identified as bona fide ligands of the tie - 2 receptor .
ang - 1 , which is mainly expressed by pericytes , is a critical player in vessel maturation and mediates the migration , adhesion and survival of ecs .
only tetrameric or higher multimeric forms of ang - 1 activate tie - 2 , whereas oligomeric ang - 2 is a weak context - dependent agonist of tie - 2 and may even antagonize the receptor [ 99 ] .
ang - 1 - mediated tie - 2 activation stimulates a number of intracellular signaling pathways , such as the pi3k / akt pathway , which promotes ec survival and nitric oxide ( no ) synthesis by the activation of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway [ 100,101 ] .
the deletion of ang - 1 between e10.5 and e12.5 results in an enlargement of vessel diameter , mainly in the capillaries [ 102,103 ] .
its phenotypes were comparable with those of ih , i.e. , increased numbers of ec and overly covered by pericytes [ 25 ] .
using laser capture microdissection , calicchio et al .
[ 52 ] found ang - 2 was significantly increased in the ih endothelium compared with the placental vessels .
in contrast , ang - 1 was decreased in proliferating ih relative to the placenta .
yu et al .
[ 104 ] demonstrated that tie - 2 was specifically increased in hemecs and that this increase corresponds to enhanced cellular responses to the tie - 2 agonist ang - 1 .
consistent with these findings , boscolo et al .
[ 42 ] revealed that hemangioma - derived pericytes exhibited low levels of ang - 1 , resulting in a diminished ability to stabilize blood vessels in ih. hif - alpha - mediated pathway hypoxia is one of the most powerful inducers of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis .
during tumorigenesis , when tumor cells outgrow the limiting diffusion distance to nearby blood vessels and become hypoxic , the balance between pro - angiogenic and anti - angiogenic molecules is tipped towards pro - angiogenic molecules .
this angiogenic switch provokes the expression of a variety of angiogenic factors by tumor cells and stromal cells , including vegf - a , stromal cell - derived factor - 1alpha ( sdf - 1alpha ) , fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) , platelet - derived growth factors ( pdgfs ) , lysophosphatidic acid ( lpa ) and ang [ 105 ] .
although the initiating mechanism during the pathogenesis of ih has yet to be discovered , there is evidence that tissue hypoxia may contribute to their explosive growth .
the initial clinical description of the promontory mark of ih as an ' area of low blood flow ' suggests that tissue ischemia , a powerful stimulus for neovascularization , may be involved [ 106 ] .
the hypothesis that ischemia / hypoxia plays a crucial role is also supported by the clinical observation of a blanched area of skin in the position of the future hemangioma .
this region may be an area of local ischemia in the skin , caused by some unknown events , that creates a hypoxic environment and thus triggers growth factor expression .
in keeping with the observations described above , ritter et al .
[ 107 ] proposed a mechanism for myeloid cell - facilitated ih growth involving the hypoxia - induced expression of several growth factors ( e.g. , insulin - like growth factor - 2 ) that drive endothelial proliferation .
kleinman et al .
[ 108 ] demonstrated the presence of hypoxia - induced mediators of progenitor / stem cell trafficking in proliferating ih specimens and revealed that the combination of hypoxia and estradiol results in a synergistic effect on the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp - 9 ) in ecs in vitro , a key factor in endothelial progenitor cells ( epcs ) .
the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor ( hif - 1alpha ) was also stabilized in proliferating hemangioma specimens .
subsequent investigations revealed that hemecs show significantly a higher expression of hif - 1alpha than normal ecs .
this upregulated hif - alpha is a major contributor to the elevated vegf levels produced in hemecs , and the decreased expression of hif - alpha reduces the proliferation of these cells [ 39 ] .
moreover , the benefit observed during ih treatment by propranolol has been suggested to also be primarily due to the reduction of hif - 1alpha expression [ 109 ] .
this suggestion has been confirmed by chim et al .
[ 110 ] , who demonstrated that propranolol exerts its suppressive effects on hemecs through the hif - 1alpha - vegf - a angiogenesis axis , the effects of which were mediated through the pi3 / akt and p38 / mapk pathways .
altogether , these findings indicate a direct and causative association between hif - alpha signaling and the development of ih. an additional possible effect of hif - 1alpha signaling in the pathogenesis of ih is mediation of ec autophagy .
in their recent study , chen et al .
[ 111 ] revealed that a short exposure to hypoxia can induce hif - alpha / bnip3 - dependent autophagy , which may promote ec survival growth .
in contrast , if the hypoxia stress is prolonged , the autophagy activation may in turn become 5 ' - amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk )/ mammalian target of rapamin ( mtor ) dependent and therefore cause programmed ec death .
however , the evidence from this study was weakened by not being performed in ih - derived cells or in ih animal models .
pi3k / akt / mtor signaling pi3k generates 3 - phosphorylated inositol lipids , causing the activation of downstream signaling , resulting in the activation of protein kinase b ( pkb ; also called c - akt ) , which regulates , among others , mtor , glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta and forkhead box o transcription factor activity .
downstream targets of mtor include p70 ribosomal protein 6s kinase ( s6k ) .
the overactivation of the pi3k / akt / mtor pathway , a signaling pathway that plays a key role in cellular growth and survival , has been implicated in various tumor pathogeneses , and as such , the inhibition of the pi3k / akt / mtor pathway is of therapeutic interest [ 112 - 114 ] .
medici and olsen [ 39 ] found that hemecs had constitutively active pi3k / akt / mtor / p70s6k and tested their hypothesis that these cells could be sensitive to mtor inhibitors ( e.g. , rapamycin ) .
finally , they demonstrated that the treatment of hemecs with rapamycin results in a significant decrease in hif - 1 and vegf - a levels and in reduced proliferation .
strikingly , in vivo and in vitro studies further demonstrated that rapamycin can reduce the self - renewal capacity of the hemscs , diminish the differentiation potential and inhibit the vasculogenic activity of these cells in vivo [ 115 ] .
these preclinical data provide us with a pharmacological basis for the potential use of rapamycin in beta - blocker - resistant ihs .
nonetheless , the mechanism that accounts for the effects of rapamycin in ih is far from clear , and a growing list of side effects make it doubtful that rapamycin would ultimately be beneficial in pediatric patients [ 112 ] .
pdgf - b / pdgfr - beta signaling the first evidence for a possible regulatory role of pdgf - b / pdgf receptor - beta ( pdgfr - beta ) signaling in ihs was provided by walter et al .
[ 116 ] .
these researchers established a genetic linkage with chromosome 5q in three familial hemangiomas .
the region , 5q31 - 33 , contains three candidate genes involved in blood vessel growth .
these genes were fibroblast growth factor receptor - 4 ( fgfr4 ) , pdgfr - beta and vegfr - 3 [ 116 ] .
subsequently , a study examining global gene expression changes between the ih growth phases by the genome - wide transcriptional profiling of blood vessels showed a reduction in pdgfr - beta expression during the involutive phase [ 52 ] .
these findings provide the possibility that pdgf - b / pdgfr - beta signaling may play a role in ih pathogenesis .
the endothelium is a critical source of pdgf - b for pdgf - beta - positive mural cell recruitment , as demonstrated by the endothelium - specific ablation of pdgf - b , which leads to pericyte deficiency [ 117 ] .
the blockade of pericyte recruitment by abolishing pdgf - b / pdgfr - beta signaling causes a lack of basement membrane matrix deposition and concomitantly increased vessel widths [ 118 ] .
in addition , the ectopic expression of pdgf - b by tumor cells results in the increased recruitment of mural cells to blood vessels on the establishment of subcutaneous tumors [ 119,120 ] .
unfortunately , despite the tight physical and functional association between ecs and pericytes , there is a paucity of information about the signals exchanged between the two cell types in ihs .
reassuringly , data from a separate study demonstrated that pdgf / pdgf - r - beta signaling may act as an intrinsic negative regulator of ih involution .
in this study , roach and colleagues [ 121 ] found that pdgf is elevated during the proliferating phase and may inhibit adipocyte differentiation .
the exposure of hemscs to exogenous pdgf results in an activation of autocrine pdgf / pdgf - r - beta signaling , thereby inhibiting ih involution .
these findings highlight the involvement of pdgf / pdgf - r - beta signaling in the development of ihs .
moreover , hemangioma - derived pericytes also express pdgfr - beta , although its effect has not been elucidated in ih pathogenesis [ 42 ] .
thus , the possibility of targeting hemsc and hem - pericyte function , for example , via their pdgf receptors , to gain enhanced efficacy of antiangiogenic treatment regiments is supported by the reports of beneficial effects of combining pdgfr inhibitors with antiangiogenic drugs or regimens [ 118,122,123 ] .
conclusion and future challenges in conclusion , the findings summarized above demonstrate that signaling pathways involved in the development of ih are increasingly being clarified , underscoring their significant relevance to understanding ih pathogenesis .
however , similar to malignant tumors , there is extensive crosstalk between individual signaling pathways in ih. this crosstalk is generally due to two factors .
first , multiple pathways often control a common process .
second , many signaling outcomes impact other processes through feedback loops and compensatory responses .
therefore , elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of ih presents an intriguing challenge .
to solve this puzzle , an organized reconstruction of the sequential molecular perturbations during ih neovascularization is required .
such an analysis needs to combine data from different levels , including genetic aberrations , expression alterations and protein modification in a comprehensive set of tissue samples .
these issues should highlight the important role that the increased knowledge of the molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of ih will have in guiding the development of effective , rationally designed therapeutic strategies .
future research efforts will not only provide us with a pharmacological basis of the therapeutic use of beta - blocker in ihs but also a basis for the further investigation of other potential anti - hemangioma agents .

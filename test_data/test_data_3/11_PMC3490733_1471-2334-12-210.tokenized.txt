background human herpesvirus 8 ( hhv - 8 ) , the aetiological agent of kaposi 's sarcoma ( ks ) , multicentric castleman 's disease ( mcd ) , and primary effusion lymphoma ( pel ) is rare in australia , but endemic in sub - saharan africa , parts of south - east asia and oceania .
while the treatment of external ks lesions can be monitored by clinical observation , the internal lesions of ks , mcd and pel require extensive and expensive internal imaging , or autopsy .
in patients with mcd and pel , if hhv - 8 viraemia is not reduced quickly , ~ 50 % die within 24 months .
hhv - 8 qpcr is a valuable tool for monitoring hhv - 8 viraemia , but is not available in many parts of the world , including those with high prevalence of ks and hhv - 8 .
methods a new molecular facility with stringent three - phase workflow was established , adhering to npaac and clsi guidelines .
three fully validated quantitative assays were developed : two for detection and quantification of hhv - 8 ; one for gapdh , necessary for normalisation of viral loads in tissue and peripheral blood .
results the hhv - 8 orf73 and orf26 qpcr assays were 100 % specific .
all qpcr assays , displayed a broad dynamic range ( 102 to 1010 copies / mul te buffer ) with a limit of detection of 4.85x103 , 5.61x102 , and 2.59x102 copies / mul te buffer and a limit of quantification of 4.85x103 , 3.01x102 , and 1.38x102 copies / mul te buffer for hhv - 8 orf73 , hhv - 8 orf26 , and gapdh respectively .
the assays were tested on a panel of 35 ks biopsies from queensland .
all were hhv - 8 qpcr positive with average viral load of 2.96x105 hhv - 8 copies / mul dna extract ( range : 4.37x103 to 1.47x106 copies / mul dna extract ) : when normalised these equate to an average viral load of 2.44x104 hhv - 8 copies / 103 cells ( range : 2.20x102 to 7.38x105 hhv - 8 copies / 103 cells ) .
conclusions these are the first fully optimised , validated and miqe compliant hhv - 8 qpcr assays established in australia .
they worked well for qualitative detection of hhv - 8 in archival tissue , and are well - suited for quantitative detection in whole blood .
they are now available for research , for clinical diagnosis of hhv - 8 infection , and for monitoring treatment efficacy .
hhv - 8 kaposi 's sarcoma human herpesvirus 8 molecular diagnostics laboratory establishment background human herpesvirus 8 ( hhv - 8 ) , the aetiological agent of kaposi 's sarcoma ( ks ) , an aids - defining condition , multicentric castleman 's disease ( mcd ) and primary effusion lymphoma ( pel ) has been extensively characterized worldwide , but largely overlooked in australia as the introduction of antiretroviral therapy in 1995 - 96 greatly reduced the incidence of ks. australian researchers have looked briefly at the risk factors associated with the sexual transmission of hhv - 8 [ 1,2 ] , at detection methods [ 3,4 ] , and at the genotyping of a few hhv - 8 isolates [ 5 ] .
despite the low prevalence of hhv - 8 associated disease in australia , since 2007 , 25 new hhv - 8 pcr positive patients have been identified in queensland , including one child aged just 3 years .
in 2011 , the first case of ks for 10 years was recognised at the gold coast sexual health clinic , and a further eight cases of hhv - 8 disease were also recognised clinically in the brisbane area suggesting the possible re - emergence of hhv - 8 - related diseases and / or increased clinical recognition and testing .
in australia , most major anatomical pathology laboratories perform hhv - 8 immunohistochemistry , but validated molecular assays are uncommon .
hhv - 8 nested pcr is performed at pathwest laboratory medicine , qeii hospital , in perth , western australia ( the referral laboratory for queensland health ) , while real - time pcr ( rtpcr ) is performed at the victorian infectious diseases reference laboratory ( vidrl ) in melbourne , victoria and the south eastern area laboratory services ( seals ) , prince of wales hospital in sydney , new south wales .
none of these laboratories perform quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) to monitor viral loads and treatment efficacy : this is of concern because , while the treatment of superficial ks can be monitored by clinical observation , both mcd and pel require more extensive and expensive internal imaging , notably with computed axial tomography ( cat ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) or positron emission tomography ( pet ) scans .
as the first research laboratory in australia specialising in the detection and characterisation of hhv - 8 , our first objective was to establish fully validated hhv - 8 qpcr assays to aid in the cost - effective and timely diagnosis of hhv - 8 associated diseases , and to accurately monitor treatment regimes and save costs of other complex monitoring methods .
even with the high sensitivity of pcr , most asymptomatic patients are hhv - 8 negative in this test , making pcr an ideal technique to monitor current infections [ 6 - 8 ] .
this report provides details to assist with overcoming many of the challenges associated with establishing a new quantitative assay including : laboratory establishment , choice of positive and negative controls , and assay optimisation and validation for hhv - 8 orf73 , hhv - 8 orf26 , and the human reference gene glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) qpcr .
these assays were used in an attempt to quantify hhv - 8 in lesional biopsies but , due to issues with normalisation , are better suited for viral detection and monitoring of treatment by detecting and quantifying hhv - 8 viraemia in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) .
methods body cavity - based lymphoma ( bcbl ) - 1 cell line harbouring latent hhv - 8 bcbl - 1 cells , an hhv - 8 positive ebv negative cell line , were seeded at 3 - 5x105 cells / ml ( counted using trypan blue ) , and cultured in gibco ( r ) rpmi - 1640 supplemented with 2 mm glutamax ( tm ) - i and 25 mm hepes ( life technologies ( tm ) , australia ) , as well as 10 % hia - fbs , 55 mum 2 - mecaptoethanol , 1 mm sodium pyruvate , and 100 mm penicillin and streptomycin at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 in a humidified atmosphere , and passaged 50 % every 3 - 4 days .
cell concentrations were maintained between 3x105 cells / ml and 1x106 cells / ml. cell stocks were kept frozen in liquid nitrogen in 10 % dmso and 90 % hia - fbs , and were mycoplasma free as determined by the pcr mycoplasma test kit ( applichem , usa ) .
viral and human genomic dna were extracted from 100 mul of cultured cells suspension diluted 1:1 with pbs using the dneasy blood and tissue kit ( qiagen , australia ) following the manufacturer 's instructions , with a proteinase k digestion performed at 56degreesc for 10 minutes in a heating block .
all samples were eluted in 100 mul of buffer ae to increase the final dna concentration .
cloning of hhv - 8 and gapdh constructs for qpcr standards amplicon containing - ta overhangs were produced by conventional pcr performed in a 20 mul volume containing 10x thermopol reaction buffer ( new england biolabs ( r ) inc. , australia ) , 0.4 mm deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate ( dntp ) , 0.2 mum primers ( geneworks , australia ) , 0.24 u / mul taq dna polymerase ( new england biolabs ( r ) inc. , australia ) and 2 mul of nucleic acid extract ( dneasy blood and tissue kit , qiagen , australia ) .
the hhv - 8 and gapdh targets were amplified from dna purified from bcbl - 1 cells .
pcr consisted of 45 cycles of amplification ( 20 seconds at 95degreesc ; 30 seconds at 58degreesc , 30 seconds at 72degreesc ) , followed by a 15 minute extension step at 72degreesc in an icycler thermal cycler ( bio - rad , australia ) .
the entire 20 mul reaction was mixed with loading buffer ( mo bio laboratories , inc. , australia ) and placed in a well of 2 % w / v agarose low eeo ( applichem , usa ) containing sybr ( r ) safe dna gel stain ( 10,000x concentrate in dmso ; life technologies ( tm ) , australia ) in tae buffer ( 0.04 m tris - acetate , 1 mm edta ) and analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis .
a molecular weight marker ( dmw - 100m , geneworks , australia ) was added as a reference .
agarose gels were run at 120 v for 30 minutes , visualised by exposure to blue light ( versadoc ( tm ) imaging system 4000 mp , bio - rad , australia ) and examined with quality one ( r ) v.6.3 1 - d analysis software ( bio - rad , australia ) .
amplicon of the correct molecular weight was gel purified ( qiaquick gel extraction kit , qiagen , australia ) and the eluted dna quantified on the nanodrop ( r ) nd - 1000 spectrophotometer ( thermofisher scientific , australia ) .
plasmid constructs were formed by ligating purified pcr amplicon into pgem ( r ) - t easy ( promega , usa ) at a concentration of 3:1 respectively .
the ligation reaction contained 2x quick ligation reaction buffer and quick t4 dna ligase ( new england biolabs ( r ) inc. , australia ) and was performed in a 20 mul volume at 25degreesc for 5 minutes .
the construct was concentrated and salts were removed by mixing 1 ml butanol with 10 mul ligation mixture and then centrifuging at 14,000 x g for one minute , decanting the butanol and then drying in a concentrator plus ( eppendorf south pacific , australia ) for 5 minutes .
the construct was resuspended in 4 mul of dh2o , mixed with 30 mul of competent dh5alpha escherichia coli , and incubated on ice for 5 minutes .
transformation was performed in a 2 mm cuvette by electroporation at 2.5 kv , 200 omega , and 25 muf with the gene pulser xcell ( tm ) system ( bio - rad , australia ) .
transformants were slowly shaken while incubated at 37degreesc for 40 minutes in 500 mul soc broth ( 2 % tryptone , 0.5 % yeast extract , 10 mm nacl , 2.5 mm kcl , 10 mm mgcl2 , 20 mm glucose ) , plated out on 2yt agar containing 50 mug / ml ampicillin , and then grown overnight at 37degreesc .
the resulting constructs were named following the convention pgem ( r ) - t / xxxx , with the xxxx corresponding to the hhv - 8 and human reference gene such as pgem ( r ) - t / orf73 .
colonies with constructs containing the gene of interest ( goi ) were selected by colony pcr screening of the white colonies as follows : constructs were released from bacterial cells by boiling for 2 minutes in 15 mul dh2o and then examined by pcr using the m - 13 universal sequencing primers ( usp ) [ 5 ' - gtaaaacgacggccagt - 3 ' and reverse sequencing primers ( rsp ) [ 5 ' - atttcacacaggaaacagctatgac - 3 '[ 9 ] .
pcr was subsequently performed in a 20 mul volume containing 10x thermopol reaction buffer ( new england biolabs ( r ) inc. , australia ) , 0.4 mm dntp , 0.2 mum primers ( geneworks , australia ) , 0.24 u / mul taq dna polymerase ( new england biolabs ( r ) inc. , australia ) .
amplicon were produced by conventional pcr consisting of 25 cycles of amplification ( 60 seconds at 94degreesc ; 90 seconds at 42degreesc ; 60 seconds at 72degreesc ) and then examined by agarose gel electrophoresis as previously described .
colonies containing the desired construct were grown overnight at 37degreesc in 3 ml of 2yt broth containing 50 mug / ml ampicillin and catalogued as glycerol stocks ( 800 mul culture in 200 mul 80 % glycerol ) .
plasmid dna was extracted from the cultures with fastplasmid ( tm ) mini kit ( 5 prime , australia ) , their concentration determined by nanodrop and diluted to 30 ng / mul .
constructs were catalogued at - 80degreesc to minimise damage from freeze / thaw cycles , but working stocks were stored at 4degreesc [ 10 ] .
nucleotide sequencing was performed on both strands of the goi within the pgem ( r ) - t easy using the abi prism ( tm ) bigdye cycle sequencing kit ( perkin elmer applied biosystems division , usa ) and the applied biosystems 3130xl capillary electrophoresis genetic analyser ( perkin elmer applied biosystems division , usa ) at the griffith university dna sequencing facility ( gudsf , griffith university ( nata accreditation # 14814 )) .
nucleotide sequence alignments were analysed using bioedit sequence alignment editor ( r ) v7.0.5.2 [ 11 ] against known sequences available in genbank .
optimisation and validation of quantitative pcr assays all qpcr assays were fully optimised and validated for the detection of hhv - 8 as outlined by the australian national pathology accreditation advisory council ( npaac ) , clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) , [ formerly known as the national committee for clinical laboratory standards ( nccls )] and by the minimum information for publication of quantitative real - time pcr experiments ( miqe ) guidelines , using both cloned constructs and dna extracted from bcbl - 1 cells as the reference material [ 10,12 - 14 ] .
the optimal primer annealing temperature ( tm ) was determined on bcbl - 1 dna extracts in duplicate with a temperature gradient from 55.0degreesc to 63.0degreesc on an iq5 real - time pcr detection system ( bio - rad , australia ) using the quantifast sybr green pcr kit ( qiagen , australia ) .
the primer concentration was determined in duplicate using a primer matrix on both sense and anti - sense primers so that the final concentration of the primers in the reaction mixture are tested from 50 nm to 900 nm [ 15,16 ] .
the concentrations of the dual - labelled hydrolysis probes were determined by testing a range between 25 nm and 300 nm. the probes were tested for integrity by running negative controls of just water and probe at low and high probe concentrations .
the optimal tm , primer concentration , and dual - labelled hydrolysis probe concentrations were determined by the amplification curve with the best shape and lowest cycle of quantification ( cq ) .
the accuracy , imprecision , pcr efficiency , linearity , measurable range , and repeatability , of the qpcr assays were validated using calibration curves [ 10 - fold serial dilutions of the cloned constructs in te buffer ( prepared in - house : 10 mm tris - hcl , 1 mm edta , ph 8.0 )] .
calibration curves were prepared fresh and examined in triplicate by qpcr on a rotor - gene q ( qiagen , australia ) .
the actual copy number , determined by qpcr ( y - axis ) , was compared to the calculated copy number ( x - axis ) graphically on microsoft excel with the standard deviations shown in vertical error bars and examined by linear regression analysis for linearity ( r2 ) , slope , intercept , and standard deviation of the residuals [ 17,18 ] .
the calculated copy number was determined from the plasmid concentration determined via nanodrop with the following formulae : 1 .
molecular weight ( mw ) ( plasmid ) in g / mol = plasmid length ( bp ) x 660 da 2 .
plasmid ( copies / g ) = avogadro 's number ( 6.02x1023 )/ mw ( plasmid ) 3 .
[ plasmid ] in mol / l = [ plasmid ] as per nanodrop ( g / l ) x mw ( plasmid ) 4 .
plasmid ( copies / mul ) = [ plasmid ] mol / mul x mw ( plasmid ) x plasmid ( copies / g ) the calibration curve was rejected if the qpcr efficiency was outside the range of 95 - 105 % ( 5 % variance from 100 %) and linearity ( r2 ) was < 0.9800 .
the measurable range of detection was determined by the linear region of the standard curve .
the repeatability of the assay was measured by running the standard curve in triplicate over a 20 day period and comparing the copy numbers .
the analytical sensitivity , determined as the limit of detection ( lod ) , and the limit of quantification ( loq ) , were determined from a calibration curve serially diluted 2 - fold .
these calibration curves were produced in triplicate with the quantitative standard of highest concentration diluted from the quantitative standard of the calibration curve serially diluted 10 - fold , which was 10 - fold greater than the minimum detectible dilution .
each standard was examined three times per day for eight days [ 19 ] .
the lod was determined at the 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) as being the point where no less than 23 / 24 samples were positive , whereas the loq was determined as the lowest concentration where the actual and calculated concentrations were nearly identical [ 19,20 ] .
since this project was performed on a single pcr machine by one operator , the robustness of the assay , although desired [ 21 ] , could not be determined .
additionally , it would be ideal to include a comparative evaluation of this method against reference methods [ 10 ] , but no such method is available in australia .
the specificity of the hhv - 8 qpcr assays were determined by running the assays against a panel of all hhv and were deemed specific if the assay only amplified the hhv - 8 sample .
quantitative pcr assays qpcr assays were designed to amplify a 142 bp and a 234 bp fragment of the hhv - 8 orf73 and orf26 respectively as well as a 104 bp fragment of gapdh from previously published primer and dual - labelled hydrolysis probe sequences ( table 1 ) [ 6,22,23 ] .
qpcr assays were set up manually in 0.1 ml strip tubes ( qiagen , australia ; cat # : 981103 ) in a 20 mul volume using the quantifast ( tm ) probe pcr + rox vial kit ( qiagen , australia ) ( containing hotstartaq ( r ) plus dna polymerase , dntp mix , and quantifast ( tm ) pcr buffer ) , 0.2 mum primers , 0.1 mm dual - labelled hydrolysis probe ( purity : hplc ; geneworks , australia ) , and 2 mul of nucleic acid extract .
the qpcr reaction was performed on a rotor - gene q starting with a five minute polymerase activation step at 95degreesc , followed by 45 cycles of amplification ( 5 seconds denaturation at 95degreesc ; 30 seconds annealing / extension at 58degreesc ) .
qpcr results were reported in " copies / mul te buffer " for the calibration curves and " copies / mul dna extract " for the clinical isolates .
for clinical samples the average viral loads were determined from both the hhv - 8 orf73 and hhv - 8 orf26 qpcr assays and then normalized to cell copy number , based on gapdh results ( there are two copies of gapdh / cell ) and then reported as hhv - 8 copies / 103 cells .

xiprobes had 5 ' terminus labeled with a fam ( 6 - carboxy - fluorescein ) fluorophore and 3 ' terminus labeled with bhq - 1 ( black hole quencher ( r )) .
controls and sample population analytical positive controls , and a range of negative controls ( analytical , no - template control ( ntc ) and clinically negative tissues ) were included on each pcr run to ensure accuracy of results .
bcbl - 1 extracts at a concentration ~ 104 ( 10 - fold higher than the assay lod ) and a 10 - fold standard curve run in singular were included in each run to ensure pcr efficiency , linearity and that cq values were consistent between runs [ 10 ] .
negative controls on each run included one sample from an hhv - 8 negative oral squamous cell carcinoma biopsy and two to three ntc samples per run , and positioned at the front , middle and end of each sample set [ 10 ] .
a pcr run was discarded due to inaccuracy if any of the following criteria occurred : ( i ) pcr efficiency differed by 5 % of the validated efficiency , ( ii ) the cq value of the positive control differed by more than 1 , ( ii ) any of the negative controls were positive so that a definite sample concentration could be determined , or if ( iv ) the standard curve was not linear ( r2 < 0.98000 ) .
the assays were tested on an opportunistic collection of ks archival lesions from various queensland hospitals retrospectively following ethical clearance ( griffith university human research ethics committee ( hrec ) ( doh / 05 / 07 / hrec ) , rbwh hrec (# 2007 / 089 ) , pah hrec (# 2007 / 117 ) , townsville hospital hrec (# 39 / 07 ) , gold coast hospital hrec (# 200750 ) , the director - general of queensland health ( br033835 , 000784 - 3 ) , and clinical and statewide services (# 128 )) .
the sample population consisted of 35 biopsies of ks lesions from 24 patients presenting between 2004 and 2011 : eight biopsies were from five hiv - negative patients ( males : females 3:2 ) with a mean age of 83.05 years ( range : 78.94 - 88.60 years ) while 39 biopsies were from 31 hiv - positive males with a mean age of 43.76 years ( range : 28.16 - 66.28 years ) .
all clinical samples were examined by both hhv - 8 qpcr assays , to determine the viral load with accuracy , and to avoid the risk of false positives and negatives [ 10,24 ] .
if a sample yielded a negative result it was re - examined with gapdh to examine for inhibition , to determine that adequate dna was in the sample and to verify that dna had been extracted [ 10 ] .
if a sample yielded a positive result but the concentration was below the lod , it was repeated .
if the repeated test showed the sample was negative or yielded a second positive result that was below the lod , it was labelled as " not detected " .
if a sample was strongly positive by one of the hhv - 8 qpcr assays , but negative in the other assay the sample was repeated in triplicate with the other assay .
if the repeat testing showed that the sample was repeatedly negative in only one of the assays then it was recorded , accordingly : e.g. hhv - 8 orf73 positive , hhv - 8 orf26 negative .
results and discussion establishing an entirely new molecular laboratory is difficult , complex and time consuming : especially for work with viruses that are rare in a particular geographical area. whether designed for research only or for clinical diagnostics , in order to produce quality results a molecular laboratory must have stringent workflows based on the npaac guidelines [ 10 ] .
pcr contamination was minimized by implementing basic laboratory practices , chemical barriers , strict sterilization practices , and a strict unidirectional pcr workflow with three physically separate areas for : preparation of reagents ; dna extraction and template adding ; and pcr amplification and post - pcr manipulations [ 10,25 - 27 ] .
however , due to space constraints , dna extraction was performed on a bench in the main laboratory with template added to the pcr reaction mixture in a top - safe 1.2 biological safety cabinet class ii ( bscii ) ( bio - cabinets australia pty , australia ) .
each area contained its own dedicated equipment , reagents and personal protective equipment [ 10 ] .
as rtpcr was performed as a sealed system , amplification was also performed in the main laboratory with the tubes only opened in the contained post - amplification area [ 10 ] .
carryover contamination was prevented by the strict implementation of the unidirectional flow from pre - amplification to post - amplification areas , with only sealed tubes and racks travelling down the workflow [ 10 ] .
if anything needed to be re - used and go against the unidirectional flow , such as pcr racks or bottles , they were decontaminated overnight in a 1:100 dilution of trigene ( r ) advance ( medichem international ltd , uk ) before returning to the pre - amplification area [ 10 ] .
cross - contamination was prevented from all dna extractions and template handling by wiping down the laboratory bench and bscii with a 1:20 dilution of trigene ( r ) advance followed by uv radiation for 20 minutes .
trigene ( r ) advance was used as a spray at 1:20 and 1:100 to soak used racks overnight due to its cost effectiveness and ability to degrade dna .
all molecular assays require clinical and analytical , positive and negative controls .
obtaining positive control samples requires formal ethical clearance which can take many months .
the usefulness of three types of molecular analytical positive controls were therefore reviewed : the uni - control method , synthetic controls ( oligonucleotides and / or plasmids ) , and plasmids ( imported or in - house ) cloned from clinical isolates / cell lines ( table 2 ) .
both the uni - control method [ 28 ] and the production of synthetic controls [ 29 ] are good options , especially for the detection of rare or hazardous viruses , as their simplistic nature produces the desirable amplification target without the need for infectious virus .
the uni - control method is a quick and simple procedure that attaches primer binding sites to the ends of pcr amplicon , but it is only an interim solution until wild - type material is available , and it cannot be used to determine viral loads or to detect low viral loads .
the production of synthetic oligonucleotides , whole genes or viral open reading frames can be used for quantitative pcr assays , but can be expensive .
while most primer / probe manufacturing companies can produce synthetic oligonucleotides these cannot be quantified , and the amplicon must be small (<= 200 bp ) .
as neither of these methods were ideal for our assays , nor are hhv - 8 quantitative controls available within australia , an attempt was made to import plasmids from international laboratories .
while this can be cost effective , after facing difficulties with the australian quarantine and inspection service ( aqis ) and several failed attempts to clone the plasmids , we acquired an hhv - 8 positive , ebv - negative body - cavity - based lymphoma cell line bcbl - 1 [ 30 ] .
these are freely available from the nih aids research and reference reagent program , easy to propagate , and do not require ethical clearance .
however , producing constructs via cloning has several inherent risks , especially cross - contamination due to the high copy numbers present : these were avoided by the strict unidirectional workflow .

the sequences of all pgem - t / orf73 [ genbank : jn613421 ] and pgem - t / gapdh [ genbank : jn613427 - jn613429 ] constructs were identical to the published sequences [ genbank : nc _ 003409 ] and [ genbank : ng _ 007073.2 ] respectively ( additional file 1 and 2 ) .
the sequence of the pgem - t / orf26 construct [ genbank : jn613422 - jn613426 ] had two conserved mismatches in all sequenced constructs ; a c - - > t mismatch within the hydrolysis probe binding site : this required the probe sequence to be modified so that a pyrimidine ( y ) would bind to both possible nucleotides ( additional file 3 ) .
the second mismatch was irrelevant .
using these constructs on a gradient block revealed the optimal tm to be 58.0degreesc for the hhv - 8 orf73 and hhv - 8 orf26 rtpcr assays .
the gapdh rtpcr assay had two optimal tm , 58.0degreesc and 62.0degreesc : the lower temperature was used so that all three assays could be performed simultaneously .
using a primer concentration matrix and hydrolysis probe dilutions , the optimal concentrations were determined to be 200 nm of both sense and anti - sense primers and 100 nm of hydrolysis probe ( table 3 ) .

dna was extracted from separate cultures of vero cells infected with hsv - 1 and hsv - 2 , cells carrying vzv , lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying ebv , supt1 cells carrying hhv - 7 , and bcbl - 1 carrying hhv - 8 .
hcmv dna was extracted from placental tissue known to be hcmv positive , and hhv - 6 dna was obtained from viral stocks .
for all viruses , except hhv - 8 , the hhv - 8 rtpcr assays yielded a negative result when examined via rtpcr and agarose gel electrophoresis , thus equating to an analytical specificity of 100 % ( figure 1 ) .
this is unsurprising , considering the specificity of pcr and that all hhv - 8 primer sequences were hhv - 8 specific when analysed with ncbi 's nucleotide - nucleotide basic local alignment search tool ( blastn ) .
gapdh amplified most samples of the specificity panel due the virion being propagated from human cell lines , except the hhv - 6 sample for which the agarose gel image showed possible primer - dimer formation .

amplification curves ( a ) and agarose gel electrophoresis images ( b ) of the hhv - 8 orf73 ( 1 ) and orf26 ( 2 ) assays tested against a panel of all eight hhv .
the gapdh pcr assay ( b.3 ) was used as a dna control as all samples were prepared from cell lines , except for hhv - 6 ( lane 6 ) .
various primer sets were used to test hhv - 1 to - 8 ( lanes 1 to 8 respectively ) .
a 100 bp molecular weight marker was used as a reference .
calibration curves produced a linear relationship for all qpcr assays from 1010 down to 102 copies / mul te buffer .
both hhv - 8 and the gapdh qpcr assays produced nearly perfect efficiency and linearity ( r2 ) with values of 99.40 % and 0.99424 for the hhv - 8 orf73 qpcr assay , 100.40 % and 0.99230 for the hhv - 8 orf26 qpcr assay , and 99.26 % and 0.99334 for the gapdh qpcr assay ( figure 2 ; table 3 ) .
calibration curves with 2 - fold serial dilutions displayed near perfect replicates from 6.43x104 to 8.04x103 copies / mul te buffer ( average coefficient of variation ( cv ) = 0.4088 ) and from 8.60x103 to 1.07x103 copies / mul te buffer for the hhv - 8 orf73 and gapdh assays respectively ( figure 3 ) .
the lod and loq of the hhv - 8 orf73 qpcr assay were equivalent at 4.85x103 +/ - 3.02x103 copies / mul te buffer ( cq = 37.44 +/ - 1.05 ) whereas for the gapdh qpcr assay the lod was 2.59x102 +/ - 2.48x102 copies / mul te buffer ( cq = 37.25 +/ - 2.16 ) but the loq was 1.38x102 +/ - 1.17x102 copies / mul te buffer ( cq = 38.52 +/ - 2.70 ) ( table 3 ) .
the sensitivity ( lod and loq ) of the hhv - 8 orf26 assay was 10 - fold greater than the hhv - 8 orf73 qpcr assay but the cv was much higher ( cv = 0.7740 ) with lod of 5.61x102 +/ - 5.46x102 copies / mul te buffer ( cq = 35.51 +/ - 1.54 ) and loq of 3.01x102 +/ - 2.43x102 copies / mul te buffer ( cq = 36.78 +/ - 2.02 ) ( table 3 ) .

although the lod of our hhv - 8 orf73 qpcr assay is 10 to 100 - fold greater than previously reported using this primer set [ 6,22 ] , scrutinising these previously published data suggests that the lod given by these authors is not as sensitive as stated .
the assay reported by lallemand et al. [ 22 ] displayed a linear standard curve between 106 to 101 copies , but data for linearity and efficiency were not given : it can be assumed , however , that their assay was not linear above 105 copies nor below 102 copies , based on the amplification curves shown and the high cv values reported .
using the same primer and probe set , asahi - ozaki et al. [ 6 ] displayed a linear relationship from 108 to 101 copies for both the hhv - 8 orf73 and gapdh assay , but close examination of their hhv - 8 orf73 amplification curves shows tight replicates down to 102 copies : it is unlikely that the assay can yield accurate results below this level with any degree of accuracy .
as our amplification curves appear identical to theirs for both assays it is most likely that the sensitivities of both our assays are comparable ( figure 2 ) .
as no hhv - 8 orf26 qpcr assay has been published , no such comparisons can be made for this .
the primer / probe sequences of our hhv - 8 orf26 qpcr assay have been used by many laboratories [ 23,31 ] , but problems with false positives have been reported [ 32 ] .
hammock et al. [ 23 ] perform their pcr assays with up to 50 cycles in order to detect potentially very low viral loads .
while many claims have been made regarding the nature of hhv - 8 in lesional tissue based on samples amplifying after many cycles ( i.e. > 40 cycles ) , it is our experience that the lod of the hhv - 8 orf26 assay is 5.61x102 +/ - 5.46x102 copies / mul te buffer ( cq = 35.51 +/ - 1.54 ) and thus any sample amplifying below this threshold is likely to be a false positive : claims based on data from large cycle numbers are not reliable .
this is critical when used clinically , especially in patients with mcd whose disease cannot be easily monitored visually , for if hhv - 8 viraemia is not reduced quickly the patient could be dead in 10 months [ 33 ] .
in order to eliminate the risk of false positives , clinical isolates were tested with both the hhv - 8 orf73 and orf26 assays [ 24 ] : these showed that all ks biopsies ( 35 / 35 ) were hhv - 8 positive .
the average viral load was 2.96x105 hhv - 8 copies / mul dna extract ( range : 4.37x103 to 1.47x106 hhv - 8 copies / mul dna extract ) , and when normalised equates to an average viral load of 2.44x104 hhv - 8 copies / 103 cells ( range : 2.20x102 to 7.38x105 hhv - 8 copies / 103 cells ) .
while it was expected that all samples would be pcr positive , because the pathology reports stated the tissues were hhv - 8 immunohistochemistry positive , no conclusion can be drawn regarding the viral loads in different stages of ks lesional tissue .
others have claimed to do so [ 6,31 ] , but it is impossible to normalise to the precise number of virus infected cells in the tissue .
these assays are , therefore , best restricted to qualitative detection of virus in tissue samples , although they can give qualitative results in peripheral blood where accurate cell counts can be made .
either way these assays are clearly a valuable tool for detection of hhv - 8 infection in a range of clinical samples .
conclusions two fully optimised , validated , and miqe compliant hhv - 8 assays have been established with excellent sensitivity , specificity and dynamics .
these assays can be normalised by cell counts based on gapdh qpcr results for use in pbmc .
these are the first hhv - 8 qpcr assays established in australia and are now available for both research and clinical diagnostics .

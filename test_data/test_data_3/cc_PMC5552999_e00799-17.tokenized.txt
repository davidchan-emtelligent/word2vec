abstract a draft genome sequence of a neutrophilic halophile capable of thiocyanate degradation , thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus fokn1 , was determined using a pacbio rsii sequencer .
a 3.23 - mb circular genome sequence was assembled , in which 3,026 gene - coding sequences , 45 trnas , and 1 rrn operon were annotated .
cover - dateaugust 2017 genome announcement thiocyanate is a major component of wastewater discharged from factories engaged in coal gasification ( 1 ) .
removal of thiocyanate has been carried out using a biological procedure , such as an activated - sludge process ( 2 ) , in which certain bacteria degrade thiocyanate aerobically to sulfate , carbon dioxide , and ammonia ( 3 ) .
so far , the thiocyanate - degrading freshwater bacterium thiobacillus thioparus ( 4 ) , neutrophilic halophile thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus ( 5 ) , and alkaliphilic halophile thioalkalivibrio ( 6 ) have been isolated from activated sludge and soda and hypersaline lakes .
recently , genome sequences of a freshwater isolate and alkaliphilic halophiles were determined ( 7 , 8 ) .
here , we report the first draft genome sequence of a thiocyanate - degrading neutrophilic halophile .
we initially enriched thiocyanate - degrading neutrophilic halophiles from activated sludge by inoculating the biomass into an inorganic medium containing thiocyanate ( per liter , 320 mg of sodium thiocyanate , 1,650 mg of ammonium chloride , 650 mg of sodium hydrogen carbonate , 29.2 mg of disodium phosphate , 0.001 % [ wt / vol ] yeast extract , and 60 % [ vol / vol ] seawater [ ph 7.0 to 7.5 ]) .
the culture was aerobically incubated at 30degreesc , and a thiocyanate - degrading neutrophilic halophile strain , fokn1 , was isolated from the enrichment culture by the serial dilution method .
strain fokn1 degraded 200 mg / liter thiocyanate within 1 week and produced ammonium in culture quantitatively .
the isolated cells were morphologically uniform , and a monospecies culture of strain fokn1 was ascertained by determining 16s rrna gene sequences , as described elsewhere ( 9 ) .
genomic dna was extracted using the qiagen dneasy minikit ( qiagen , tokyo , japan ) and was subjected to sequencing on a pacbio rsii sequencer and single - molecule real - time ( smrt ) cell 8pac v3 , with the dna polymerase binding kit p6 ( pacific biosciences , ca ) .
the sequencing produced 146,654 valid reads ( average length , 7,905 bp ) , which were assembled into a 3.23 - mb circular genomic sequence by means of the hgap3 software ( 10 ) .
gene prediction and annotations were performed via the migap pipeline ( 11 ) , as previously mentioned ( 12 ) , and 3,026 coding sequences ( cdss ) , 1 rrn operon , and 45 trna genes were annotated .
the full - length 16s rrna gene sequence ( 1,504 bp ) from the genome was subjected to blastn analysis , and the 16s rrna gene sequence showed 99.1 % similarity with that of the thiocyanate - degrading neutrophilic halophile thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus hrh1 , previously isolated from hypersaline chloride - sulfate lakes ( 5 ) .
because 99 % similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequence has been employed as a threshold above which a bacterium can be assigned to the same bacterial species ( 13 ) , the strain fokn1 was here designated thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus strain fokn1 .
a gene encoding thiocyanate dehydrogenase was present in the thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus fokn1 genome as well as the thioalkalivibrio thiocyanoxidans arh2 genome ( genbank accession number arqk00000000 ) , while a gene encoding thiocyanate hydrolase was missing ( 7 ) .
this finding suggests that fokn1 cells degrade thiocyanate by using thiocyanate dehydrogenase instead of thiocyanate hydrolase , which should be further investigated .
accession number ( s ) .
the thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus fokn1 genome was deposited in the ddbj nucleic acid sequence database under the genbank accession no. ap018052 .

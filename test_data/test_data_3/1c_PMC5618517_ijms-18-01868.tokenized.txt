in recent years , the relevance of the immune system to fight cancer has led to the development of immunotherapy , including the adoptive cell transfer of immune cells , such as natural killer ( nk ) cells and chimeric antigen receptors ( car ) - modified t cells .
the discovery of donor nk cells' anti - tumor activity in acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo - sct ) was the trigger to conduct many clinical trials infusing nk cells .
surprisingly , many of these studies did not obtain optimal results , suggesting that many different nk cell parameters combined with the best clinical protocol need to be optimized .
various parameters including the high array of activating receptors that nk cells have , the source of nk cells selected to treat patients , different cytotoxic mechanisms that nk cells activate depending on the target cell and tumor cell survival mechanisms need to be considered before choosing the best immunotherapeutic strategy using nk cells .
in this review , we will discuss these parameters to help improve current strategies using nk cells in cancer therapy .
moreover , the chimeric antigen receptor ( car ) modification , which has revolutionized the concept of immunotherapy , will be discussed in the context of nk cells .
lastly , the dark side of nk cells and their involvement in inflammation will also be discussed .
natural killer ( nk ) immunotherapy tumor cell survival mechanisms inflammation 1 .
natural killer ( nk ) cell modulation activity natural killer ( nk ) cells are cells of the innate immune system with high anti - tumor , antiviral and antimicrobial activity .
in healthy individuals , 90 % of nk cells in peripheral blood ( pb ) are mature and cytotoxic , and characterized by the expression of cd16bright and cd56dim .
the remaining 10 % of nk cells represent the immature subset of nk cells that are cytokine producers , and express cd16dim or cd16 - , cd56bright and cd25 + [ 1 ] .
the activity of nk cells is modulated by an array of inhibitory and activating receptors , which are fundamental in controlling nk cell activity .
whereas inhibitory killer - cell immunoglobulin - like ( kir ) receptors inhibit nk cell cytotoxicity by interacting with the human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) - i in human cells , activating receptors activate nk cells by interacting with their ligands in target cells induced upon tumor transformation , viral infection and cell stress .
in physiological conditions , inhibitory kir - hla - i interaction holds nk cell cytotoxicity against normal cells in the body .
however , when a kir - hla - i mismatch or hla - i down - regulation occurs after viral infection or in some tumor cells , inhibitory kirs cannot interact with their ligands activating nk cell cytotoxic function [ 2 ] .
this finding observed by ruggeri et al. in 2002 in acute myeloblastic leukemia ( aml ) patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo - sct ) , allowed using the inhibitory kir ( donor ) - hla - i ( patient ) mismatch as a prognostic factor in aml patients receiving an allo - sct [ 3 ] .
this " missing self " recognition leads to allo - reactivity after allo - sct , and consequently , nk cells lyse leukemia blasts , recipient dendritic cells ( dcs ) and recipient t cells , which translates into a reduction of relapse , prevention of graft vs. host disease ( gvhd ) , and prevention of graft rejection , respectively .
the " missing self " recognition led to the proposal of the " missing ligand model " as a powerful algorithm to predict a potent anti - leukemia effect and , consequently , a favorable outcome after allo - sct [ 3,4 ] .
however , in non - myeloid malignancies , such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) , the gvhd reduction and prevention of graft rejection was not always accompanied by an increase of the graft vs. leukemia effect observed in aml [ 5 ] .
these conflicting results led to applying the " missing ligand model " mostly in aml [ 6 ] , and in non - myeloid malignancies to use this model just for nk - mediated killing of dcs and t cells to predict a reduced gvhd and reduced graft rejection , respectively .
the graft vs. leukemia effect occurring mostly in aml could be mediated by hla down - regulation , which does not occur in other malignancies such as all .
to support this , clinical studies in all confirmed that low hla - i expression levels in blasts conferred a beneficial effect mediated by allo - reactive nk cells [ 7 ] .
however , nk cells have a high variety of activating receptors , which also modulate their cytotoxic activity .
these receptors will play a fundamental role in the recognition of other types of tumor cells which do not down - regulate hla - i. some of these receptors are expressed only at given stages of differentiation or by specific nk cell subsets [ 8 ] .
surprisingly , this high number of activating receptors in nk cells is responsible for the existence of 6000 - 30,000 different phenotypic nk populations in each healthy individual , which provide flexibility to respond to pathogens and tumor cells [ 9 ] .
activating receptors include different families such as the : ( i ) activating kirs which interact with tyro protein tyrosine kinase binding protein ( dap - 12 ) ; ( ii ) c - type lectin - like receptors , including the activating cd94 / nkg2c and nkg2d .
nkp80 , included in this family , exerts an autonomous control of nk cells against excessive inflammatory response causing self - nk cells mediated cytolysis [ 10,11,12 ] ; ( iii ) natural cytotoxicity receptors ( ncr ) which include nkp30 , nkp44 and nkp46 and interact with ligands overexpressed on tumor cells and viral infected cells ; and ( iv ) signaling lymphocyte activating molecule ( slam ) family of receptors which include slamf1 , 2b4 , ntb - a , cd48 , cd84 , ly9 , and cracc .
they transmit activating signals to mediate nk cytotoxicity .
moreover , nk cells express cd16 , which is the fc receptor that binds ig - g mediating antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( adcc ) .
2. nk cell classic cytotoxicity mechanisms upon recognition , nk cells eliminate target cells rapidly ( within 30 - 60 min ) by different mechanisms .
the two classic nk cell cytotoxic mechanisms include the death receptor pathway and the granule dependent pathway .
the death receptor pathway is activated by the tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - related apoptosis inducing ligand family ( trail ) and by fas - ligand ( fasl ) ( cd95l ) which are expressed on nk cells [ 13 ] , and interact with their ligands in target cells .
interaction of fasl with fas and trail with trail receptors allows the formation of a death - inducing signaling complex that includes fas - associated death domain protein ( fadd ) , caspase - 8 , and caspase - 10 [ 14 ] .
activation of caspase - 8 results either in direct activation of the other caspases or in the proteolysis of bid , with release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase activation .
even if it were believed that these receptors only activate apoptosis , new studies have revealed that other types of non - apoptotic inflammatory types of cell death can be activated [ 15,16 ] .
the granule dependent pathway is initiated after nk cells adhere to the target cell , with subsequent delivery of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and proteases called granzymes toward the bound target cell [ 17 ] .
in humans , there are five different types of granzymes ( a , b , h , k and m ) and each one will activate different cell death pathways , either apoptotic or non - apoptotic .
granzymes a and b are the most studied ones .
whereas granzyme b activates apoptosis through activation of caspases or release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria , apparently , granzyme a activates non - apoptotic cell death [ 18 ] ; however , there are conflicting results regarding the cytotoxic role of granzyme a [ 19 ] .
the other granzymes have been less studied , although it has been shown that granzyme k is released by cd56bright cells mediating non - apoptotic tumor cell death [ 20 ] .
granzyme m shows anti - tumor properties after adoptive nk cell transfer [ 21 ] .
granzyme h helps granzyme b kill adenovirus - infected cells [ 22 ] ; and granulysin , which is another nk cytotoxic molecule released in the cytotoxic granules , activates endoplasmatic reticulum stress leading to cell death [ 23 ] .
all these different cytotoxicity mechanisms that nk cells show , enable them to eliminate different types of tumor cells with their intrinsic characteristics .
3. immunotherapy strategies using nk cells as previously mentioned , the anti - tumor nk cell activity described after allo - sct added to the finding that unlike donor t cells , nk cells do not induce gvhd , led to the development of many clinical trials infusing nk cells in patients receiving an sct .
we have reviewed published studies infusing nk cells as an immunotherapy option .
results are not optimal ; they are summarized in table 1 .
in most of these studies , nk cells were activated in vitro and / or in vivo with interleukin ( il ) 2 , and administered after immunosuppressive treatment based on fludarabine and cyclophosphamide .
patient disease , disease status , number of nk cells infused and number of nk cell infusions differed from one study to another .
all published studies agree that nk cell infusion is a safe and well - tolerated procedure and does not associate to gvhd .
whereas , for myeloid malignancies , most studies used nk cells from haploidentical donors considering the kir - hla - i mismatch , in non - myeloid malignancies , nk cells were either autologous or allogeneic and expanded in vitro .
in myeloid malignancies , haploidentical nk cells with kir - hla - i mismatch have been used either as a consolidation therapy [ 24,25 ] or in high risk and refractory patients [ 26,27 ] .
as a consolidation therapy , in both children with aml and elderly aml patients , nk cells showed a clear benefit .
after a median follow up of four years , pediatric patients remain in remission , and elderly patients with high risk aml showed prolonged disease free survival ( dfs ) after nk cell infusion [ 24,25,28 ] .
these studies concluded that nk cells could be a promising consolidation therapy strategy in patients who are not candidates for receiving an allo - sct .
another novel consolidation therapy strategy in aml consisted on the infusion of nk cells derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells ( hpc ) obtained from a cord blood ( cb ) unit .
this technique allowed obtaining enough number of nk cells which were well tolerated .
unlike other procedures , this study did not administrate il2 into patients , and responses were detected , suggesting that this technique allows obtaining effective nk cells which might be used off - the - shelf when required [ 29 ] .
in refractory patients , results are not good .
however , it was noticed that infusion of haploidentical nk cells combined with il2 diphtheria toxin fusion protein ( il2dt ) to deplete host t - reg cells led to higher nk cell expansion , improved complete remission rate and disease - free survival with no increased toxicity in aml patients [ 26 ] .
lee et al. also showed durable responses associated with cd56 + cells delivered in myeloid malignancies [ 27 ] .
another study in aml and mds found resolution of dysplastic features in 50 % of myelodisplastic sindrome ( mds ) patients , and 16 % of complete remission ( cr ) in aml ; however , they could not find nk cells in peripheral blood ( pb ) [ 30 ] .
in pediatric refractory aml patients who received or did not receive an allo - sct previously , responses higher than 50 % were detected after nk infusion , and combined with allo - sct afterwards , 27 % and 36 % of dfs were achieved , respectively , at six years [ 31 ] .
another approach tested in high risk aml patients , consisted in the infusion of haploidentical nk cells previously primed with tumor cell lysates .
il2 was not administrated to patients , and still nk cells seemed to exert anti - leukemia effect in 57 % of the patients .
however , at 2 years 85.7 % patients died [ 32 ] .
studies in myeloid malignancies indicated that better responses were achieved when infusing nk cells in patients in remission suggesting that nk cells cannot overcome large tumor burdens .
therefore , more recent approaches aim at expanding nk cells in vitro to obtain a high number of nk for large tumor mass .
in non - myeloid malignancies , both haploidentical nk cells and nk cells expanded in vitro from other sources have been used .
infusion of haploidentical nk cells in multiple myeloma ( mm ) relapsed patients , before an autologous - sct ( auto - sct ) , obtained 50 % of complete or near complete responses [ 33 ] .
yang et al. expanded allogeneic nk cells in vitro allowing infusion of repetitive administrations of nk cells in advanced lymphoma and advanced solid tumors .
they found that activated and expanded nk cells are also safe obtaining 47.1 % of stable disease .
interestingly , they observed that t - reg cells and myeloid - derived suppressor cells were reduced after nk administration [ 34 ] .
in relapsed mm , different protocols infusing in vitro expanded nk cells with k562 artificial antigen presenting cells ( aapcs ) have been tested .
for instance , leivas et al. combining autologous expanded nk cells with anti - mm drugs ( lenalidomide / bortezomib ) showed 80 % of disease stabilization and that the combination of nk cells with lenalidomide was the best one .
they did not administrate il2 into the patients [ 35 ] .
szmania et al. infused either autologous or haploidentical expanded nk cells combined with bortezomib - dexamethasone based anti - mm treatment , and il2 in vivo administration , obtaining much lower responses ( 28 % pr ) [ 36 ] .
shah et al .
[ 37 ] infused expanded nk cells derived from a cb unit ( cb - nk ) and combined them with lenalidomide before auto - sct .
eighty - three percent of patients showed very good partial responses ; at 21 months , 33 % of patients relapsed .
these three studies showed that nk cell in vitro expansion using aapc k562 - based system is an efficient technique to obtain a high number of activated nk cells , which are safe for patients .
the nk cells in vitro expansion technique with aapc k562 - based system can be visualized in figure 1 .
in the context of non - hematological malignancies , haploidentical nk cells have been used with no optimal results .
in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors , haploidentical nk cells were infused after haplo - sct .
no toxic effects were observed , and 66 % of the patients showed a clinical response .
however , all patients had died after 310 days [ 38 ] .
in adults with recurrent ovarian and breast cancer , the beneficial effect of nk cells could not be differentiated from the chemotherapy regimen [ 39 ] .
another approach in hepatocellular carcinoma combined allogeneic in vitro expanded nk cells showing kir - hla - i mismatch with cryosurgery .
beneficial effects were detected in terms of enhanced immune function , increased progression free survival ( pfs ) and improved of patients' quality of life [ 40 ] .
in metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma , autologous nk cells did not show any anti - tumor activity .
although nk cells persisted in pb they had lost nkg2d expression and needed to be re - activated with il2 [ 41 ] .
in 2008 , alici et al. also developed a technique to expand nk cells without the need of feeder cells .
they managed to obtain a high number of activated nk cells starting from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) , by adding anti - cd3 antibody for the first five days and il2 [ 43 ] .
afterwards , they compared different expansion systems by using flasks , cell culture bags and bioreactors and showed that bioreactors without the need of feeder cells obtained the best results [ 44 ] .
afterwards , they used this technique in a clinical trial with five refractory cancer patients who received donor - derived expanded nk cells after allo - sct .
in one patient ( 20 %) with hepatocellular carcinoma partial responses were observed with markedly decreased serum alpha - fetoprotein levels [ 42 ]. of interest , other type of feeder cells ( epstein - barr virus immortalized lymphoblastoid b - cell lines : ebv - lcl ) have also been tested to expand nk cells , also obtaining a high number of activated nk cells with efficient anti - tumor activity in mouse melanoma models [ 45 ] .
more information about clinical studies infusing activated nk cells into patients has been addressed in other reviews [ 46 ] .
all these studies demonstrated that : ( 1 ) there is a lack of expansion and persistence of nk cells in pb at long term , which is due to allo - reactive t cells eliminating nk cells [ 47,48 ] ; ( 2 ) the negative immunosuppressive effect of t - reg cells might be improved with the use of il2dt [ 26 ] ; ( 3 ) nk cells might be a better choice for consolidation therapy rather than for refractory patients ; ( 4 ) in non - myeloid refractory malignancies , nk cells do not achieve durable responses and the kir - hla - i ligand mismatch might not be always efficient .
moreover , after nk in vitro expansion , the kir - hla - i mismatch effect in some occasions can be bypassed , and the expression of nk receptors become homogenous because of the expansion .
therefore , in non - myeloid malignancies , activating receptors could be more relevant [ 49,50 ] ; ( 5 ) different expansion techniques such as the aapc k562 - based system , nk cells derived from hpc and nk - 92 cell line have been developed to overcome the limitation in obtaining large number of nk cells for the treatment of large tumor masses .
these techniques allow obtaining a high number of nk cells ready to infuse off - the - shelf [ 29 ] .
4. chimeric antigen receptors ( car ) modified nk cells whereas car - t cell therapy has appeared in the last years as a revolutionary immunotherapy option for the treatment of hematological malignancies , car - modified nk cells is a field still under development .
a car is a chimeric molecule composed of three regions : ( 1 ) an extracellular domain derived from the single chain variable fragment ( scfv ) of a monoclonal antibody ( mab ) , which redirects the specificity of t cells towards a specific target expressed in tumor cells without the need of antigen presentation ; ( 2 ) a transmembrane domain ; and ( 3 ) an intracellular domain derived from the zeta chain of the t cell receptor ( tcr )/ cd3 complex which activates the lytic pathway of t cells .
moreover , co - stimulatory signaling endodomains ( cd28 , 4 - 1bb or ox40 ) activate t cell proliferation after encounter of the target cell .
the number of co - stimulatory domains can differ between the different car [ 51 ] .
first clinical studies infusing car - t cells showed the efficacy of these cells in refractory patients [ 52 ] ; consequently , an increasing number of clinical studies infusing car - t cells are currently being executed .
the intrinsic anti - tumor activity of nk cells added to the high number of activating receptors that initiate their cytotoxic activity would lead us to hypothesize that nk cells do not need a car .
however , the negative clinical results infusing nk cells , especially in refractory patients , indicate that other options are needed .
the addition of a car into nk cells might add an additional mechanism of tumor cell recognition , specifically useful in patients with down - regulation of the ligands required for activation of nk receptors .
furthermore , after recognizing the tumor cell , the car will induce nk cell proliferation increasing nk cell persistence in patients .
however , up to date , only preclinical studies using car - nk cells have been published .
these include car - nk targeting cd19 and cd20 for b cell malignancies [ 53,54,55 ] , cd5 for t cell malignancies [ 56 ] , and cd138 and cs1 for mm [ 57,58 ] .
in solid tumors , many preclinical studies have also been published targeting among others her2 , gd2 and egfr for breast cancer , renal cell carcinoma , ovarian cancer , melanoma , neuroblastoma and glioblastoma [ 59,60,61,62 ] .
most of these studies have used nk - 92 cells .
however , other nk cell sources tested include nk cells previously obtained from hpcs [ 63 ] , and nk cells from cb and expanded in vitro with aapc k562 - based systems [ 53 ] .
more detailed information about current pre - clinical studies on - going with car - nk cells can be found in other reviews [ 64 ] .
some advances made in these studies indicate that the addition of il15 into the car construct increases nk cell persistence in vivo [ 53 ] .
moreover , the inability of nk cells to traffic to tumor sites has been eliminated by the addition of c - x - x motif chemokine receptor 4 ( cxcr4 ) in the car construct [ 65 ] .
clinical studies infusing car - nk are very scarce up to date and they are still recruiting patients .
these studies target cd19 for b cell malignancies , cd33 for cd33 + aml and cd7 for leukemias and lymphomas .
most of these studies use either nk - 92 cells or nk cells expanded in vitro with aapc k562 - based systems .
they are summarized in table 2 .
5. cb derived nk cells ( cb - nk ) : a source of highly activated nk cells which initiate a transmissible cytotoxicity the aapc k562 - based system used to expand nk cells appears as one of the preferred techniques to expand nk cells in all published studies .
these cells can have either membrane - bound il15 or il21 , which are required for nk cell differentiation [ 66 ] .
therefore , this system , starting from mononuclear cells , allows obtaining a large number of differentiated nk cells .
we have used this technique to expand nk cells from a cb unit .
these nk cells are termed cb derived nk cells ( cb - nk ) .
at the end of the in vitro expansion , a large number of highly activated nk cells are obtained .
therefore , fully tested and hla - typed nk cells are available off - the - shelf [ 50 ] .
interestingly , in physiological conditions , the cd56 bright nk cells are the immature population , with longer telomeres than cd56dim nk cells [ 67 ] .
however , after in vitro expansion , cb - nk become a cd56bright cell population with a homogenous phenotype in terms of inhibitory kirs and activating receptors , such as nkg2d and the ncr family of receptors [ 50 ] .
moreover , cb - nk show longer telomeres than freshly obtained nk cells from cb [ 68 ] , and are highly activated in terms of both cytokine production and cytotoxicity [ 43,64 ] .
we have studied the specific cytotoxicity of cb - nk against mm cells , which express hla - i , and compared it against that of tumor cells with hla - i down - regulation ( k562 cells ) [ 69 ] .
we observed that cb - nk cytotoxicity differs for each type of tumor cell , in terms of nk cell receptors , cytotoxic molecules and types of cell death activated .
whereas nkg2d and nkp30 activating nk cell receptors do not have any impact in cb - nk cytotoxicity against k562 , for mm cells , these receptors as well as nkg2d ligands have a significant role .
moreover , whereas granzyme b is involved in cb - nk cytotoxicity against k562 cells mediating a caspase - 3 dependent cytotoxicity ; in mm cells , granzyme b does not impact the cb - nk cytotoxicity , which , in addition , is caspase - 3 independent .
moreover , this cytotoxicity against mm cells involves cathepsin release from lysosomes , which mediate a type of cell death termed " lysosomal cell death " .
this dependence on cathepsins occurs only in mm cells and not in k562 cells [ 69 ] , indicating the variety of cytotoxic mechanisms that nk cells can activate depending on each type of tumor cell .
interestingly , when cb - nk and mm cells become in contact , both nkg2d and nkp30 receptors are transferred to mm cells .
this transfer of nk cell receptors co - localizes with lipid structures .
when filipin - iii - - a lipid raft inhibitor - - is added , this nk cell receptor transfer to mm cells decreases , suggesting a role of lipid metabolism in controlling the stability of these receptors in nk cells .
nk cell activating receptors are continuously being recycled and degraded by endocytic pathway [ 70 ] .
more specifically , the transfer of nkg2d and nkp30 co - localizing with proteins of the endocytic pathway ( rab1 , rab7 and rab11 ) was confirmed [ 69 ] .
importantly , the transfer and degradation of these receptors in mm cells , might explain why cancer patients have nk cells that show with down - regulation of activating receptors [ 71,72 ] .
moreover , after cb - nk contact , mm cells become stressed and increase cell - cell communication between them .
this increased cell - cell contact enables a secondary transfer of nkg2d and nkp30 nk cell receptors from mm cells exposed to cb - nk to neighboring mm cells non - exposed to cb - nk. interestingly , this secondary transfer between mm cells of cb - nk proteins translates into a transmissible cytotoxicity mediated by mm cells , as initial mm cells exposed to cb - nk are able to transfer lipid - protein vesicles to neighboring mm cells non - exposed to cb - nk , causing cytotoxicity into a proportion of these neighboring mm cells ( figure 2 ) [ 69 ] .
remarkably , in addition to this novel transmissible cytotoxicity mechanism , we also observed that mm cells by establishing cell - cell communication among them ; a diluent effect of the toxicity appears to be initiated .
in particular , after cb - nk exposure , mm cells decrease their reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and lysosome ( lys ) levels .
after contacting neighboring mm cells , this decrease in ros and lys is subsequently also observed in the neighboring mm cells , and surprisingly , the initial mm cells which contacted cb - nk manage to recover their original ros and lys levels ( figure 2 ) [ 69 ] .
these events suggest a mechanism used by mm cells to recover from the damage caused by cb - nk. in this regard , increased cell - cell communication is a common event observed in cells after toxic events , such as cytotoxic drug administration , where damaged cells , by communicating with neighboring cells , propagate the damage across the cell population , and , therefore , they manage to recover [ 73,74,75 ] .
therefore , this transmissible effect mediated by tumor cells is a double edged - sword : on the one side , there is a transmissible cytotoxicity between mm cells ; and , on the other side , it could be a tumor cell survival mechanism .
this mechanism might decrease the final cytotoxic impact of nk cells , a finding that might have negative implications when using expanded nk cells as an immunotherapy option .
6. tumor cell survival mechanisms after immunotherapy tumor cells develop many different types of immune evasion mechanisms that make them unrecognizable by nk cells .
these mechanisms include down - regulation of mica / b and ulbp1 / 3 , the ligands of nkg2d [ 76,77 ] .
moreover , high levels of soluble ulbp [ 78 ] , and b7 - h6 [ 79 ] , the ligands of nkg2d and nkp30 , induce down - regulation of nk cell activating receptors , which correlate with metastases in patients [ 79 ] .
in fact , it is common that cancer patients have hypo - responsive nk cells with down - regulation of nkg2d [ 71 ] and nkp30 [ 72 ] .
interestingly , high plasma level of soluble mica / b , in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) patients correlates with nk cell inhibition , inability of nk cells to infiltrate hnscc tumors , and disease progression , which was reverted in vitro after removal of soluble mica / b from hnscc patients' plasma [ 80 ] .
moreover , the authors of this study tested successfully in rhesus monkeys an approach to remove soluble mica from plasma by adsorption apheresis , a technique that could be used to improve cancer immunotherapy using nk cells [ 80 ] .
a pro - inflammatory environment also contributes to nkg2d down - regulation , as release of the pro - inflammatory macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( mif ) after inflammatory stimuli [ 81,82 ] , contributes to nkg2d down - regulation and impaired nk cell cytotoxicity in cancer patients [ 83 ] .
interestingly , nkg2d down - regulation has been also observed after nk cell immunotherapy , leading to hypo - responsive nk cells [ 41 ] .
this down - regulation of nk cell activating receptors associate with progressive disease [ 71 ] , and also it has been suggested to occur due to chronic engagement of these receptors by their ligands expressed on tumor cells [ 72 ] .
another mechanism explaining this observed down - regulation of nk cell activating receptors could be due to the transfer of nk cell receptors between tumor cells after immune cell - tumor cell contact , as we have observed for cb - nk and mm cells .
this transfer , occurring in part through lipid structures , could be avoided by previously inhibiting lipid metabolism in tumor cells .
an interesting clinical approach would be to test approved and not toxic drugs involved in lipid metabolism inhibition , and to use them as co - adjuvants just before patients receive the immunotherapy treatment .
car - immunotherapy requires continuous engagement of the car with its target antigen on tumor cells , which unfortunately can lead to development of tumor cell immune evasion mechanisms , such as loss of expression of the target antigen .
actually , this loss of expression is one of the main problems after car - t cell therapy with concomitant patient relapse [ 84,85 ] , which unfortunately will lead to 2nd and 3rd lines of car treatment targeting different antigens .
researchers have tried to solve this problem by using dual cars , which target two antigens at the same time .
however , even though a dual car might show superior activity [ 86 ] , there is a risk for a relapse that will be resistant to two different antigens instead of one .
even though this phenomenon with car - nk has not been detected yet due to lack of studies , it is a possibility that needs to be analyzed .
moreover , after car - nk cell therapy , other types of tumor cell survival mechanisms have been detected , such as up - regulation by tumor cells of the immunosuppressive ligand hla - g , which render car - nk unresponsive to tumor cells [ 87 ] , and showing the variety of immune evasion mechanisms that tumor cells can develop after immunotherapy .
the previously explained phenomenon of receptor transfer between cells , occurring also after car immunotherapy , could explain why some patients relapse .
in particular , we observed that bcma , a target antigen in mm cells and currently being tested for car immunotherapy [ 84 ] , is transferred to cb - nk and to neighboring mm cells ( personal communication : [ 88 ]) .
avoiding this receptor transfer between cells as previously mentioned , by previously inhibiting lipid metabolism in tumor cells , could be also a strategy to improve car - nk immunotherapy .
the " immune checkpoints " which consist in pairs of receptors - ligands present in immune and tumor cells are also among the tumor cell survival mechanisms developed against nk cells .
the interaction of these receptors in tumor cells with their ligands in immune cells inhibits the immune activity .
lymphocyte activation gene - 3 ( lag - 3 ) , cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen - 4 ( ctla - 4 ) , programmed death - 1 ( pd - 1 ) and t cell immunoglobulin and itim domain ( tigit ) are among the most studied immune checkpoints .
whereas immune checkpoints have been mainly studied in t cells , nk cells are also affected by these interactions .
for instance , studies have shown that nk cells from mm patients express pd - 1 whereas normal nk cells do not [ 89 ] , and interestingly , monoclonal antibodies against pdl1 enhanced nk cell cytotoxicity in mm patients [ 90 ] .
b7 - h3 , which is over - expressed in tumor cells , inhibits nk cell activity correlating with poor prognosis ; and its inhibition improved nk cell activity controlling tumor growth [ 91 ] .
pd - 1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in digestive cancers , and its blockade promoted nk cell functions and suppressed tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma models [ 92 ] .
tim - 3 , which correlates with poor survival in melanoma , inhibits nk cell activity , and its blockade improved nk cell anti - melanoma activity in vitro [ 93 ] .
up - regulation of hla - g in ewing sarcoma cells induced up - regulation of its receptor cd85j inhibiting nk cell activity [ 87 ] .
inhibiting all these interactions with monoclonal antibodies , such as ipilimumab ( anti - ctla - 4 ) , nivolumab ( anti - pd - 1 ) and others that are already being used in the clinic might also be useful in immunotherapy strategies infusing nk cells .
these tumor cell survival mechanisms are summarized in table 3 .
7. inflammatory response : a double - edged sword in cancer in addition to their anti - tumor role , nk cells are also well - known by their antimicrobial properties against fungal [ 94 ] and bacterial pathogens [ 95 ] .
granzymes and granulysin are important mediators of this activity .
in detail , granzymes a and b are involved in the resolution of bacterial infection after escherichia coli ( e. coli ) - induced peritonitis [ 96 ] and klebsiella - induced pneumosepsis [ 97 ] .
granzyme m is involved in the antimicrobial nk cell activity against listeria monocytogenes [ 98 ] ; and granulysin also show antimicrobial properties [ 99,100,101 ] .
unfortunately , the antimicrobial activity of these granzymes correlates also with the production of pro - inflammatory mediators required to mount a general inflammatory response to eliminate pathogens .
an inflammatory response prolonged and not resolved can lead to sepsis , but also to other inflammatory complications such as autoimmunity. of interest , cd56 bright cells are associated to autoimmunity [ 102 ] .
in more detail , granzyme a and m are involved in the production of il - 1alpha , il - 1beta , tnf , and ifngamma after bacterial stimuli , and also in the development of sepsis [ 103 ] .
granzyme m induces the production of mip - 1alpha after listeria monocytogenes infection [ 98 ] .
granzyme k promotes a pro - inflammatory response with production of tnf - alpha , il6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 , is elevated sepsis , and also is released against activated t cells in multiple sclerosis [ 104,105,106 ] .
granzyme a is associated to autoimmune diseases such as arthritis [ 107 ] ; and granulysin acts as a chemoattractant activating monocytes to produce cytokines [ 108 ] .
this pro - inflammatory activity of nk cells is also activated by the other cytotoxic mechanism that they can employ , the death receptors ; as both , trail receptors [ 109 ] and fasl [ 110 ] activate inflammation through tnf and nf - kappab pathway [ 111,112 ] .
moreover , a prolonged and not resolved inflammatory response also leads to tumor cell proliferation .
in fact , almost 2000 years ago , galenus described the possibility that cancers evolved from inflammatory lesions .
therefore , the pro - inflammatory mediators released after nk cell immunotherapy in cancer patients is a factor that needs to be considered .
on the one side , an acute inflammatory response of the immune system is needed to eliminate tumor cells .
actually , after car - t cell immunotherapy , the patients with the best clinical outcomes are the ones who develop the highest cytokine release syndrome ( crs ) with the highest il6 levels detected [ 84 ] .
however , if this response is not resolved and prolonged , pro - inflammatory cytokines ( il1b , il18 , and il6 ) might have a prejudicial effect activating inflammation and tissue damage [ 14,113 ] , and , moreover , will lead to tumor cell proliferation .
in fact , the same inflammatory molecules associated to nk cell activity , such as tnf - alpha , il - 1beta and il - 6 , are also elevated in advanced stage cancer patients correlating with risk of death [ 114 ] .
moreover , tnf and nf - kappab pathway activated by trail receptors and fasl , in addition to inducing tumor cell death , eventually will promote proliferation of tumor cells [ 111,112 ] .
as previously mentioned , in vitro expanded nk cells used for immunotherapy , such as cb - nk , acquire a highly activated and inflammatory phenotype with bright cd56 expression , high production of granzymes and other inflammatory mediators .
we have performed proteomic studies to define the proteome released from cb - nk to mm cells and have observed a high variety of pro - inflammatory mediators including granzyme a and granulysin ( personal communication : [ 88 ]) .
moreover , car - nk cells also require a process of in vitro expansion , indicating the pro - inflammatory potential of these cells .
these pro - inflammatory properties acquired after in vitro expansion , suggest that a proper strategy for cancer immunotherapy , should also target inflammation in the long term to avoid the detrimental consequences of this response .
clinical protocols should include co - adjuvants to avoid chronic inflammation without eliminating the anti - tumor response .
future clinical studies performed with in vitro expanded nk cells will provide with more information about this issue .
8. concluding remarks to summarize , clinical results infusing allogeneic nk cells have shown a clear benefit when infused as a consolidation therapy in aml patients .
on the contrary , in refractory cancer patients with non - myeloid malignancies , nk cells have not yet been successful .
nk cells do not proliferate in vivo and , moreover , many patients show down - regulation of nk cell activating receptors .
in addition , tumor cells develop immune evasion mechanisms , including down - regulation of the ligands of nk cell activating receptors .
similarly , tumor cells are able to acquire nk cell activating receptors in part through lipid structures , which might explain the down - regulation of these receptors in nk cells .
car - nk cell therapy will add an additional tumor cell recognition mechanism to compensate this imbalance in nk cell activating receptors , and , furthermore , will induce nk cell proliferation in vivo .
in addition , a dilution of the nk cell damage performed by cell - cell communication between tumor cells has been observed , which might allow them to recover after nk cell treatment .
drugs inhibiting this tumor cell survival mechanism will improve clinical results using nk cells .
lastly , most nk cell sources infused into patients have been expanded in vitro acquiring high inflammatory properties .
therefore , clinical protocols will need to find the best protocol that target the inflammatory response after nk cell immunotherapy without impacting in the nk cell anti - tumor activity .
conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest .

activated nk cells can be generated starting either from mononuclear cells ( mnc ) or with magnetically selected nk cells .
first , either cb or apheresis products are ficolled to get the mnc , and then they are either added directly to a bio - reactor or subjected to magnetic cd56 + selection .
these cd56 + cells will be added to the bio - reactor .
then , they are expanded in vitro for seven days with artificial antigen presenting cells ( aapcs ) .
il2 is added exogenously every other day .
aapcs are k562 - based aapcs expressing 41bb ligand , cd64 , cd86 and either membrane bound il21 or il15 .
they are co - cultured in a 2:1 aapc : mnc or nk cells ratio .
on day 7 , fresh aapcs are added again in the same ratio and co - cultured in the same conditions for an additional seven days .
on day 7 and day 14 , cells are cd3 - depleted , only in case the expansion was started with mnc .
expansion can be continued for a total of 4 weeks repeating the same procedure .
pb : peripheral blood .
figure 2 transmissible cytotoxicity mediated by cord blood - derived nk cells ( cb - nk ) against multiple myeloma ( mm ) cells .
when mm cells and cb - nk become in contact , nkg2d and nkp30 receptors are transferred into mm cells through lipid structures .
a decrease in reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and lysosome ( lys ) levels is observed in mm cells exposed to cb - nk. when neighboring mm cells contact mm cells exposed to cb - nk , nk cell receptors are transferred into these neighboring mm cells , and lys and ros levels also decrease into neighboring mm cells .
consequently , a fraction of neighboring mm cells dies because of this cb - nk cytotoxicity .
at the same time , ros and lys levels in mm cells exposed to cb - nk return to their original levels which could be a recovery of the initial damage caused by cb - nk. ijms - 18 - 01868 - t001 _ table 1 table 1 clinical studies performed with nk ( natural killer ) cells as immunotherapy treatment .

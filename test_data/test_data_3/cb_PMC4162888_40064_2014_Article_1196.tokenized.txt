newcastle disease represents the most severe poultry disease responsible for marked economic losses in ethiopia .
to provide a molecular characterization of newcastle disease viruses circulating in this country , a cross sectional survey was conducted at five selected live poultry market sites in addis ababa .
in addition , baseline data on the live poultry market system were acquired through a detailed questionnaire submitted to poultry traders .
we identified 44 / 146 positive samples , 29 of which were virulent strains belonging to sub - genotype vif .
the very poor biosecurity practices , which have resulted from responses of the participants , suggest that they might have had a heavy impact in the spread of the disease .
this study provides important information on epidemiology and control of ndv in ethiopia and highlights the importance of implementing surveillances and biosecurity practices in live poultry markets .

keywords newcastle disease virus biosecurity practices molecular characterization live poultry markets ethiopia issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 introduction poultry play an important economic , nutritional and socio - cultural role in the livelihoods of poor rural households in developing countries , including ethiopia .
the total poultry population in ethiopia is estimated at 43 million , 97 % of which are village chickens ( central statistical agency 2012 ) .
poultry rearing is particularly important to women , who often own and manage chickens and the resulting income is often used to support education of children .
despite its role in raising incomes and reducing poverty in local communities of ethiopia , poultry production is hampered by wide arrays of constraints among which infectious diseases , such as : newcastle disease , infectious bursal disease , mycoplasmosis , pasteurellosis and salmonellosis , are the major ones ( chaka et al. 2012 ) .
newcastle disease ( nd ) is one of the major problems in village chickens in most parts of ethiopia ( nasser 1998 ; tadelle and jobre 2004 ; mazengia 2012 ) .
the disease has become endemic in poultry population and recurs every year inflicting heavy losses ( tadelle and jobre 2004 ) .
the highest rate of nd outbreaks from march to may is suggested to be associated with high rate of chicken marketing for easter ( spradbrow 1999 ) .
the main movement of chicken marketing is from periphery to the center ( rural to towns ) which favors the spread of diseases all over the country ( dessei and ogle 2001 ) .
however , there is acute lack of information on bio - security situation and roles of poultry marketing practices in diseases dissemination in the country ( shewantasew et al. 2012 ) .
nd is caused by virulent strains of newcastle diseases virus ( ndv ) or avian paramyxovirus type 1 ( apmv - 1 ) that belongs to the genus avula and family paramyxoviridae ( mayo 2002 ) .
ndv has an enveloped , single - stranded negative sense rna genome of approximately 15 kb that contains six genes encoding major structural proteins such as : nucleocapsid protein ( np ) , phosphoprotein ( p ) , matrix protein ( m ) , fusion protein ( f ) , hemagglutinin - neuraminidase ( hn ) , and the rna - dependent rna polymerase ( l ) ( kattenbelt et al .
2006 ) as well as two additional proteins , v and w from the p gene by a mechanism called rna editing ( steward et al. 1993 ) .
the key contributors to ndv pathogenicity are the formation of an active fusion protein upon cleavage of the f protein precursor ( f0 ) as well as the presence of a number of basic residues in the fusion protein cleavage site ( toyoda et al. 1987 ; glickman et al. 1988 ) .
ndv that are virulent for chickens have a multibasic amino acid sequence 112r / k - r - q - k / r - r116 at the c - terminus of the f2 protein and f ( phenylalanine ) at residue 117 , which is the n - terminus of the f1 protein , whereas the viruses of low virulence have a monobasic amino acid sequences in the same region of 112g / e - k / r - q - g / e - r116 and l ( leucine ) at residue 117 ( kim et al. 2008 ; office of international epizootes 2012 ) .
although nd represents the most severe poultry disease responsible for marked economic losses in ethiopia , virological and epidemiological information concerning the virus strains circulating in the country especially in village chickens are extremely scarce .
the aim of this study was therefore , to detect ndv and to perform a molecular characterization of the virulent strains currently circulating at five live poultry market sites in addis ababa .
in addition , we investigated the biosecurity practices implemented at the market sites to identify the factors that can contribute to the spread of the virus .
materials and methods sample origin the study was conducted in december 2012 in five live poultry market sites in addis ababa namely : kotebe , merkato , shola , saris and semen ( adisu gebeya ) ( figure 1 ) .
these are among the biggest poultry market sites in addis ababa that host chickens originating from most parts of the country , mainly from places located within 300 kms radius such as : sodo , hosaina , dessie , shashemane , jimma , and ambo .
all the markets are outdoor markets where chickens are kept in wire mesh cages , each housing up to 40 birds during the day and night .
figure 1 map of study area .
poultry market sites where samples were collected .
sampling , data collection and virus isolation a total of 365 chickens were sampled : from each market , 70 birds were sampled except merkato from where 85 birds were sampled by considering its larger size compared to the others .
thus , 73 tracheal swabs ( pool of five ) and 73 cloacal ( pool of five ) were collected .
in separate cryovial containing 2 ml of freshly prepared viral transport media ( vtm ) .
the swabs were collected in pairs ( tracheal swab pools and cloacal swab pools were always collected from the same chickens ) .
after sampling , the specimens were transported to the national animal health diagnostic and investigation center ( nahdic ) laboratory and stored at - 80degreesc until processing .
besides , a standardized questionnaire was administered to the poultry traders in each market sites .
a total of 100 volunteer traders were interviewed to assess the bio - security practices in live poultry markets .
the questionnaire included questions about the source of the birds , means of transportation , the number of birds in each market site , cleaning practices at the market sites including the cages , health status of the birds and disposal of manures and dead chickens .
viruses were isolated from the swab samples by standard virus isolation methods in embryonated chicken eggs .
three embryonated chicken eggs of 9 to 11 - day - old per sample were used for inoculation ( alexander and senne 2008 ) .
the inoculated eggs were candled every 24 hours to check embryo vitality .
eggs containing dead embryo on each day and those remained at the end of incubation period , were removed from incubator and chilled at + 4degreesc overnight .
allantoic fluids were harvested and tested by haemagglutination ( ha ) test for its ability to haemagglutinate chicken rbcs .
haemagglutination and haemagglutination inhibition tests the ha assay was carried out in microtitre plate as outlined by the world organization for animal health ( office of international epizootes 2012 ) .
ha positive samples were tested by heamaglutination inhibition ( hi ) reaction to specifically determine the haemagglutinating agents .
inactivated antigen for ha test and positive and negative sera for hi controls were obtained from istituto zooprofilattico spermentale delle venezie ( oie / fao reference laboratory for ai and nd ) , padua , italy .
polymerase chain reaction tests forty four ha and hi positive allantoic fluids were analyzed by real - time reverse transcription ( rt - pcr ) tests .
viral rna extraction from hi positive allantoic fluid was conducted using qiagen ( r ) rneasy mini kit according to manufacturer 's instruction .
real - time rt - pcr reactions were performed at national animal health diagnostic center , sebeta using an applied biosystems 7500 fast real - time pcr thermo cycler .

twenty nine f gene positive allantoic fluids were submitted to instito zooprofilattico sperimentale delle venezie ( oie / fao reference laboratory for ai and nd ) , padua,italy for further analyses .
nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis total rna was extracted from infective allantoic fluids using qiagen ( r ) rneasy mini kit according to manufacturer 's instruction .
amplification was performed with primers noh - for ( 5 ' - tac acc tca tcc cag aca gg - 3 ') and noh - rev ( 5 ' - agt cgg agg atg tgt tgg cag c - 3 ') which encompass 260 bp region of the fusion ( f ) gene .
amplicons were then purified with exosap - it ( usb corporation , cleveland , oh ) .
sequencing was carried out by using big dye terminator v 3.1 cycle sequencing kit ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) in a 16 - cappilary abi prism 3131x genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems , forster city , ca,usa ) .
for complete sequencing of f gene , rna was reverse transcribed with the superscript iii reverse transcriptase kit ( invitrogen , carsbad , ca , usa ) and amplified using primer pairs described in table 1 .
sequence data were assembled and edited with seq scape software v2.5 ( applied biosystems ) .
to determine the phylogenetic relationships , the sequences of the f gene were compared to the corresponding region of representative viruses of class ii available in genbank .
alignment and comparison of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were performed using clustal w in mega 5.0 .
maximum likelihood ( ml ) trees were estimated using best - fit general time - reversible ( gtr ) model of nucleotide substitution with gamma - distributed rate variation among sites , and a heuristic spr branch - swapping search available in phyml version 3.0 ( guindon and gascuel 2003 ) .
a bootstrap resampling process ( 100 replications ) was employed to assess the robustness of individual nodes of phylogeny .

they are originated from different districts across the country , most of which were collected by traders from big towns such as : sodo , dessie , shashemane , jimma , ambo , hosaina and transported on public transport ( bus ) to addis ababa .
the majority ( 99 %) of traders mentioned that there is no habit of cleaning buses before loading and after unloading chickens owing to the fact that no vehicles is designed for poultry transportation alone .
after arrival at the market sites , chickens are sold to wholesalers in the biggest live bird market site ( merkato ) where birds from different origins are placed in the same cages ( mixed ) and sold either to traders in other live poultry markets in the city or to the consumers on spot .
ninety nine percent of the traders clean the holding cages once a week with clean water and the remaining 1 % clean every day .
all the traders responded that they dispose manure and dead birds either within the markets or on roadside .
none of them seek for veterinary services when chickens are sick .
laboratory results out of the 146 pooled samples tested , 44 were positive for ndv by both ha / hi and m gene real - time rt - pcr tests .
out of these , 29 isolates were identified as virulent based on the real - time rt - pcr of f gene .
among these , 14 tracheal swab pools ( ts ) were positive though the corresponding cloacal swab pools ( cs ) were negative .
similarly , 3 cs were positive though the corresponding ts were negative .
however , the remaining 12 swab pools have shown direct correlation ( 12 ts and the corresponding 12 cs were positive ) and were not considered as separate entity to avoid double counting of the samples ( table 2 ) .
the identification , pathotyping and genotyping of the 29 isolates were confirmed by genetic sequencing of the 260 bp region of fusion ( f ) gene and the complete f gene sequence of two isolates ( kj958913 _ 13vir3936 - 1 and kj958914 _ 13vir3936 - 27 ) collected from the market sites saris and kotebe .
since all the viruses showed a high similarity at the 260 bp region of the f gene ( table 2 ) , the selection was based on the sequencing quality ( i.e. absence of degenerate bases ). the isolates were identified as virulent as deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site indicated the presence of motif 112 rrqkr116 * f117 typical of ndv virulent strains .
phylogenetic analysis of the 260 fragment of the f gene of all the 29 sequenced isolates ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) and complete coding region of the f gene of two representative viruses ( figure 2 ) indicated that the viruses are clustered together ( similarity ranged from 98 % to 100 %) within the new sub - genotype vif .

discussion in this study , we assessed biosecurity practices in market sites in addis ababa that contribute to the spread of the diseases along market chain .
we observed several practices that could promote newcastle disease and other infectious diseases transmission among birds .
these included limited cleaning and disinfection of the market places , holding cages , mixing of birds from different origins , inappropriate disposal of sick and dead birds and poor waste disposal mechanisms .
earlier reports indicated that marketing systems play a considerable role in the dissemination of diseases over wide geographical areas in a relatively short period of time in ethiopia ( gebreab 1995 ) .
similar observation was reported from addis ababa live poultry market sites ( shewantasew et al. 2012 ) .
the current finding is also in agreement with a report from nairobi live bird markets where poor biosecurity practices were suggested to play major roles for transmission of avian influenza viruses ( munyua et al. 2012 ) .
these factors were found to be associated with transmission of low pathogenic avain influenza viruses in markets in north america ( garber et al. 2007 ) .
the current study showed that , virulent viruses with multiple basic amino acids at cleavage site of f protein 112rrqkr116 * f117 are circulating in village chickens .
the finding is in agreement with earlier studies which revealed that , the majority of the virus strains circulating in the village chickens in ethiopia are virulent strains ( chaka et al. 2012 ) .
virulent newcastle disease virus ( vndv ) is endemic in many countries of africa , north , central , and south america , and outbreaks of nd are frequently reported to the world organization of animal health ( office of international epizootes 2011 ) .
according to diel et al .
( 2012 ) classification , our phylogenetic analysis of the 260 fragment of the fusion gene of all the 29 sequenced isolates ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) indicated that the viruses are grouped in the new sub - genotype vif class ii viruses , and grouped with ndv identified in ethiopia ( de almeida et al. 2013 ; chaka et al. 2013 ) .
the genotype was confirmed by analysis of complete coding region of the f gene of two representative viruses ( figure 2 ) , which showed 95 % to 99.3 % similarity with the ndv isolated in 2011 suggesting the persistence of this sub - genotype in poultry in the country .
while the 260 nucleotide sequences of samples collected from the market sites of merkato and kotebe were all identical , sequences of viruses from saris , shola and meri showed a nucleotide identity ranging from 99.3 % to 100 % , from 98 % to 100 % and from 98.7 % to 100 % , respectively ) .
which revealed that , identical isolates are circulating in livebird markets in addis ababa .
this could be associated with the poor biosecurity practices and the use of similar marketing channel in these market sites .
however , fentie et al .
( 2013 ) identified genotype vii viruses in the north western ethiopia , indicating the co - circulation of different genotypes in ethiopia .
genotype vi , include viruses that have been isolated from multiple avian species ( alexander 2011 ; czegledi et al. 2006 ; kim et al. 2008 ) .
viruses of this group are important because of their frequent association with doves and pigeons and consequent risk for introduction in to poultry flocks ( alexander 2011 ; kim et al. 2008 ) .
it is interesting to note that ethiopian viruses analyzed here grouped with viruses collected in nigeria from pigeon and doves ( identity of about 90 %) , suggesting that this genotype may have emerged in africa as a result of transmission from pigeon to poultry .
in conclusion , the current study revealed that village chicken flocks are endemically infected with virulent newcastle disease virus , which could pose a threat to commercial poultry farms .
this study highlights the importance of implementing surveillance and molecular investigations of newcastle disease , in village chickens and wild birds , along with improved biosecurity measures in the live poultry markets in ethiopia .

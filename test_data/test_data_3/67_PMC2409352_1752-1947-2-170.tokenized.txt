introduction pure lateral elbow dislocation is rare , and a successful closed reduction is even rarer .
reduction can be hindered by swelling , soft tissue interposition or associated fractures .
case presentation we present a pure lateral traumatic dislocation of the elbow joint in a 40 - year - old man .
this was successfully manipulated and reduced in casualty using a modification of the gravity - aided ' hanging arm ' technique originally described for shoulder dislocations by stimson .
conclusion we strongly recommend the use of this simple technique in these rare yet difficult injuries , in order to avoid potential complications with general anaesthesia and surgery .
introduction pure lateral elbow dislocation is rare , and a successful closed reduction is even rarer .
reduction can be hindered by swelling , soft tissue interposition or associated fractures .
the elbow dislocation of the case we present here was irreducible by conventional methods , so we adapted a modification of a historical method to successfully reduce it. a historical review is discussed subsequently .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first reported application of this particular technique for this rare injury .
case presentation a 40 - year - old right - hand - dominant man was offloading beer crates while perched on a box .
as he turned round , he lost his balance and fell with his left hand outstretched and elbow extended .
he presented with a swollen and deformed elbow joint .
it was held in 60degrees of flexion , and with the forearm in pronation .
distal circulation and motor function were intact , but he complained of pins and needles in the ulnar nerve distribution .
his radiographs showed a true lateral displacement of the left proximal radius and ulna in relation to the humerus ( figure 1 ) .
the olecranon was in contact with the lateral condyle , and in line with the transverse axis of the distal end of the humerus .
however , the anatomical relationship of the radius and ulna was maintained and no fractures could be visualised .

a closed reduction was attempted under light sedation by the casualty registrar using conventional methods , but proved unsuccessful .
the patient was re - examined by the orthopaedic team and was placed prone with the affected left arm hanging by the edge of the bed .
ten minutes later , with the patient still sedated , the elbow was first disimpacted by applying longitudinal traction on the forearm with counter - traction on the arm .
it was then enlocated applying gentle medial pressure on the olecranon .
valgus and varus instability of the elbow was checked in full extension and 30degrees of flexion .
normal sensation returned spontaneously in the ulnar nerve distribution .
the elbow was then immobilised in plaster in 90degrees of flexion .
radiographs confirmed a satisfactory reduction with normal joint congruity ( figures 2 and 3 ) .
the patient was offered a follow - up appointment a week later , but could attend only 3 weeks later on account of personal commitments .
his plaster was removed and his elbow stressed to check for medial or lateral ligamentous instability .
nothing untoward was found , but he was started on an intensive physiotherapy regime .
he subsequently regained the normal range of elbow movements and was discharged from care after his second follow - up visit at 2 months .

discussion stimson [ 1 ] originally described his ' hanging arm ' technique for reducing shoulder dislocations .
this method consisted of the patient lying prone in a canvas cot , with the affected arm hanging through a hole in the canvas .
weights were then placed in the dependent hand , and reduction occurred due to the synergistic effect of muscle relaxation and gravity .
rollinson [ 2 ] modified this technique by hanging the affected arm over the side of the bed .
also , instead of applying weights he used a supraclavicular brachial nerve block to relieve pain and evoke muscle relaxation .
levine [ 3 ] described reduction of an elbow dislocation by seating the patient in a chair , with the arm dangling over the back of the chair .
this however required co - operation from the patient , which can be difficult in certain circumstances .
parwin [ 4 ] has employed a technique similar to stimson 's , consisting of prone positioning , traction at the wrist , and elevation of the humerus to produce reduction .
meyn and quigley [ 5 ] improved on this by grasping the olecranon with the operator 's other hand , and guiding it into place .
prone positioning and gravity - aided traction has also been used successfully by minford and beattie [ 6 ] .
all of these techniques have been employed to reduce posterior dislocations , contrary to the pure lateral in this case .
our technique also differs in requiring two persons to manipulate , as we feel that guiding the olecranon in a purely medial direction requires both hands from the main operator , with the assistant constantly applying counter - traction .
the ease of reduction justifies the use of an additional pair of hands .
simple lateral dislocations should theoretically be amenable to closed manipulation , as documented by vijaya [ 7 ] in his case report .
however , reduction can be impeded by fractured articular fragments or interposed muscle .
exarchou [ 8 ] found the anconeus muscle interposed between the articular surfaces and preventing reduction .
vaidya [ 9 ] has documented the brachialis muscle and a coronoid chip fracture to be the causes of the irreducibility in their patient .
both these cases required open reduction and stabilisation .
conclusion pure lateral elbow dislocation is rare , and a successful closed reduction is even rarer .
the reduction can prove difficult , even under general anaesthesia , due to swelling , soft tissue interposition or associated fractures .
we have adapted a modification of stimson 's original method to reduce a purely lateral elbow dislocation .
such an atraumatic and mechanically simple technique can prove very useful in a busy casualty department .
it also avoids potential complications with general anaesthesia and surgery , while giving an anatomically congruent reduction .

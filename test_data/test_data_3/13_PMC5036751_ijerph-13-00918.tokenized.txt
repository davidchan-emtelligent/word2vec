empirical and prolonged antimicrobial treatment of urinary tract infections caused by escherichia coli is associated with the emergence of bacterial resistance , and not all countries have strict policies against the indiscriminate use of drugs in order to prevent resistance .
this cross - sectional and retrospective study ( 2010 - 2015 ) aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and resistance of patient - derived e. coli to different drugs broadly used to treat urinary infections in brazil : ampicillin + sulbactam , cephalothin , ciprofloxacin , norfloxacin , and nitrofurantoin .
we obtained 1654 e. coli samples from ambulatory patients with disease symptoms of the urinary tract from a brazilian public hospital .
while all antibiotics were effective in killing e. coli to a large degree , nitrofurantoin was the most effective , with fewer samples exhibiting antibiotic resistance .
we assessed the costs of generic and brand name versions of each antibiotic .
nitrofurantoin , the most effective antibiotic , was the cheapest , followed by the fluoroquinolones ( ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin ) , ampicillin + sulbactam and , lastly , cephalothin .
finally , assessment of antibiotic resistance to fluoroquinolones over the study period and extrapolation of the data led to the conclusion that these antibiotics could no longer be effective against e. coli - based urinary infections in approximately 20 years if their indiscriminate use in empirical treatment continues .
urinary infection antibiotics bacterial resistance escherichia coli 1 .
introduction bacterial urinary infections are common in clinical practice , where approximately 80 / 1000 consultations lead to this diagnosis [ 1 ] .
in general , infections are caused by gram - negative aerobic bacteria of the intestinal microflora .
the most predominant species is the enterobacterium escherichia coli , which is normally associated with acute cases [ 1,2 ]. e. coli causes both intestinal and extra - intestinal infections .
antimicrobial treatment of infections caused by e. coli must be appropriately targeted ; for this purpose , the medical community uses a wide variety of drugs both alone or in combination .
among the most widely used drugs or combinations in brazil are ampicillin with sulbactam , cephalothin , ciprofloxacin , norfloxacin , and nitrofurantoin .
while antibiotics are considered the most effective method of treatment for bacterial infections , their empirical , indiscriminate , prolonged , or incorrect usage contributes significantly to the emergence of new infections by leading to the selection of resistant strains [ 3,4 ] .
for instance , 20 % of relapses and 3.7 % of new cases of tuberculosis are caused by rifampicin - and isoniazid - resistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis [ 5 ] .
in addition , several other classes of bacteria have already exhibited multidrug resistance to antibiotics , such as klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli strains producing extended - spectrum beta - lactamase ( esbl ) , which hydrolyses the beta - lactam ring of penicillin , cephalosporins , and other related antibiotics , contributing to treatment failure [ 6,7 ] .
drug - resistant microorganisms have spread worldwide , affecting both hospital infections and the community in general .
this highlights the diversity and potential genetic mechanisms of resistance , as well as indicating a co - selection to antibiotics , especially fluoroquinolones , aminoglycosides , and sulphonamides [ 8 ] , drugs of choice for empirical treatment of urinary tract infections worldwide .
the prevalence of antibiotic resistance stems primarily from the promiscuous nature of bacteria , as susceptible bacteria may acquire resistance genes from plasmids and other horizontally transferred genetic material , resulting in evolution by leaps [ 9,10 ] .
in addition to plasmid - mediated resistance mechanisms , there are other resistance factors associated with empirical treatment that are of concern , especially when considering urinary tract infections caused by e. coli .
one such concern is the ability of bacteria to form micro - colonies ( biofilms ) on the mucosal lining of the bladder to resist the host 's immune response and conventional antibiotic treatment [ 11 ] .
two factors are associated with the development of these biofilms : the incorrect use of antibiotics to eliminate the infection [ 11 ] and the inappropriate choice of medicines due to individual and collective economic problems , especially in developing countries [ 12,13,14 ] .
several considerations are involved in the correct choice of antibiotics for the treatment of genitourinary tract infections , including pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , costs , and the ability of the drug to eliminate the causative agent of the infection .
considerations , such as cost , may be one of the reasons that resistance levels vary greatly by country [ 3 ] .
it is also worth mentioning that , as of yet , there are not many treatment alternatives for patients affected by resistant strains .
thus , understanding the problem of antibiotic resistance and determining the best antibiotic for treatment or discovering new treatment alternatives represents one of the greatest challenges of this century .
our study used a cross - sectional , retrospective study to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of 1654 samples positive for e. coli that were obtained from outpatients of a public hospital in the brazilian health system .
in addition , we also surveyed and compared the real costs to the community of the primary antibiotics used to treat these infections .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
experimental design this retrospective , cross - sectional study was conducted in a public hospital at the federal university of triangulo mineiro belonging to the brazilian health system in minas gerais / brazil .
this hospital attends to approximately 1.17 million inhabitants belonging to more than 27 cities in the macroregion south of the triangulo mineiro .
data were collected from january 2010 to december 2015 from the clinical pathology services database of the hospital , including reports of technical procedures conducted and urine cultures performed in the laboratory .
the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki , and the protocol was approved by the ethics committee of federal university of triangulo mineiro ( protocol number : 914797 ) .
2.2 .
inclusion and exclusion criteria adherence to trial criteria was assessed in a systematic fashion , as represented in figure 1 .
first , we only included ambulatory patients who underwent examination of urine culture during the trial period ( january 2010 to december 2015 ) .
furthermore , we only included positive urine cultures with >= 105 colony - forming units ( cfu )/ ml , and we excluded urine cultures that were not positive for escherichia coli after identification .
2.3 .
bacterial identification urine was sampled in a sterile container , and 0.001 ml was plated on cystine lactose electrolyte deficient ( cled ) agar with a calibrated platinum loop .
the culture was incubated for 18 - 24 h at 35 degreesc , and bacterial colonies were then counted , with results expressed in cfu / ml. species identification was performed using standard biochemical tests .
2.4 .
antimicrobial susceptibility testing antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted on mueller hinton agar ( himedia , mumbai , india ) using a standard disc diffusion method with discs of standard potency as per the clinical and laboratory standards institute 's guidelines [ 15 ] .
the antibiotics tested were as follows ( potency in mug / disc ) : ampicillin + sulbactam ( 10 + 10 ) , cephalothin ( 30 ) , ciprofloxacin ( 5 ) , norfloxacin ( also known as floxacin ) ( 10 ) , and nitrofurantoin ( 300 ) .
after evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility , we investigated the relative frequency ( rf ) of the number of susceptible or resistant cases in each year , where we obtained the ratio between the frequencies of susceptibility ( s ) and resistance ( res ) ( sumrfs )/( sumrfres ) in order to assess whether there was variation in the number of these cases / year depending on the antibiotic analyzed .
2.5 .
commercial values to determine the costs of the investigated antibiotics for statistical comparison , we used standard prices from the journal of the brazilian association of pharmaceutical commerce .
2.6 .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using the graphpad prism program ( graphpad software , san diego , ca , usa ) .
to analyze paired elements , we used the paired t - test .
normality ( kolmogorov - smirnov ) and homogeneity of variance ( bartlett 's ) tests were applied to all variables .
when under normal distribution and homogeneous variance , parametric tests ( anova with post - hoc tukey 's multiple comparison ) were applied , and the results are expressed as the mean +/ - sem .
otherwise , we used non - parametric tests ( kruskal - wallis test with dunn 's multiple comparison ) , and the results are expressed as median , maximum , and minimum values .
differences were considered significant when p <= 0.05 [ 16 ] .
3. results the frequency of outpatient urine samples found in the database that were positive for the bacteria e. coli was high (~ 79 %) compared to the frequency of samples positive for other microorganisms .
this frequency was also higher in female patients ( 83 %) than in male patients ( 17 %) .
over the course of the six years of study , we obtained 1654 e. coli - positive urine samples , with an average of 275.70 +/ - 30.16 samples / year and a coefficient of variation of 26.80 % ( table 1 ) .
3.1 .
efficacy of antibiotics against patient uroculture - derived e. coli samples for each e. coli - positive urine sample , we evaluated the phenotypic profile of sensitivity and resistance to five antibiotics ( table 1 and figure 2 ) .
although there was variation in the distribution between the sensitivity and resistance samples ( ampicillin + sulbactam = 77.32 / 22.68 ; cephalothin = 68.17 / 31.83 ; ciprofloxacin = 71.10 / 28.90 ; norfloxacin = 69.25 / 30.75 ; nitrofurantoin = 94.04 / 5.95 ) , all antibiotics tested exhibited significant efficacy ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 2 ) .
3.2 .
relative frequency of antibiotics used for empirical treatment of urinary infections after verifying that all tested antibiotics were effective against patient - derived e. coli , we evaluated whether there were significant differences in the distribution in the ratio of the relative frequencies of susceptibility and resistance over the years to each antibiotic .
in general , ratios higher than 1 (> 1 ) in the relative frequencies demonstrate positive indices for antimicrobial susceptibility ( table 2 ) .
in this sense , the antibiotic nitrofurantoin was the one who showed the best results once it exceeded five - fold of the ratio of the relative frequency of susceptibility and resistance over the years ( p < 0.05 ) .
on the other hand , the antibiotics of the classes of fluoquinolones and cephalothin have ratios of the relative frequencies lower than 1 , indicating less satisfactory indices for antimicrobial susceptibility ( table 2 ) .
in other words , regardless of the year in which the test was performed , the frequency of susceptible samples ( relative frequency ) was higher for the nitrofurantoin .
likewise , the frequency of resistant samples per year was also always lower for the nitrofurantoin .
3.3 .
temporal variation in antimicrobial resistance in brazil in addition to assessing the susceptibility of samples to different antibiotics , we also investigated temporal variation in antibiotic resistance ( figure 3 and table 3 ) .
the percentage of samples resistant to each antibiotic in each of the six years was plotted , and pearson 's correlation was determined ( figure 3a - e ) .
the data reveal non - linear and non - significant correlations for ampicillin + sulbactam , cephalothin , and nitrofurantoin ( figure 3a,b,e ) .
however , there were consistent linear increases in resistance to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin , both fluoroquinolones ( figure 3c,d ) .
these increases were in the order of 63.53 % for ciprofloxacin and 66.50 % for norfloxacin from 2010 to 2015 .
both ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin exhibited significant positive correlations between the resistance of samples and the year the samples were collected ( p < 0.05 ) .
we extrapolated this correlation into an estimation of future resistance to fluoroquinolones ( table 3 ) .
based on this prediction , we can assume that if resistance continues to increase at the same pace , fluoroquinolones will no longer be effective against urinary tract infections 20 years from now .
3.4 .
variation in the cost of drugs used to treat genitourinary infections caused by e. coli an important factor in successful treatment of bacterial infections is the implementation of the treatment , beginning with the acquisition of the drug and followed by its correct usage .
thus , we conducted a survey of the cost of drugs used to treat urinary infections caused by e. coli .
most of these drugs are available from community clinicians , with the exception of cephalothin , which is restricted to hospital use .
values take into account whether the medicine is generic or brand - name .
the only exception was sulbamox bd ( r ) ( farmasa , sao paulo , brazil ) , which was compared to another generic drug of the same class ( beta - lactamase inhibitor ) because it is generally prescribed .
the data revealed high variation in cost ( amounts in brazilian currency , the real ) based on antibiotic , brand , and tax rate of the state ( 12 % , 17 % , 18 % , or 19 %) .
costs ranged from r $ 6.17 +/ - 0.11 to r $ 230.80 +/ - 4.17 for drugs used in the community and up to r $ 244 +/ - 4.41 for drugs used only in the hospital ( table 4 ) .
we calculated the average commercial value of brand - name and generic drugs for each antibiotic used for treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by e. coli ( table 4 ) , revealing significant differences between the means ( p < 0.05 ) .
surprisingly , while nitrofurantoin was demonstrated to be the most effective by our susceptibility testing , it exhibited the lowest average cost ( r $ 7.83 +/ - 1.66 ) among all evaluated antibiotics ( p < 0.05 ) .
4. discussion in this study , we evaluated the efficacy of antibiotics against strains of e. coli causing urinary tract infections .
we also performed a comparison of the actual costs of the generic and brand - name antibiotics used for the treatment of urinary infections .
after assessing the bacterial strains associated with urinary tract infection in ambulatory patients over six years , we noted a high frequency of infections caused by e. coli , particularly in female patients .
this is corroborated by data on e. coli infections worldwide [ 17,18 ] .
we believe that e. coli infection may be even more prevalent considering the large number of cases of urinary infection where the causative agent is never identified and / or the infection is treated empirically [ 19 ] .
moreover , although the number of e. coli - positive samples identified in our study was considerable ( 1654 positive samples over six years , with an average of 276 new cases annually ) , e. coli infection is likely to be even more prevalent , as these numbers do not include outpatients , in whom urinary tract infections may be common .
several studies have evaluated the microbicidal activity of the antibiotics used for urinary tract infections , as well as the mechanisms involved in drug resistance [ 6,18,20,21 ] .
such studies demonstrate a major cause for concern regarding the epidemiology of resistance to antibiotics used to treat urinary infections [ 22,23 ] .
in our first experiment , we measured the effectiveness of five antibiotics used to treat urinary infections : ampicillin combined with sulbactam , an inhibitor of beta - lactamase ; cephalothin ; the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin ; and nitrofurantoin .
in general , all antibiotics exhibited high efficacy , indicating that they are appropriate for empirical treatment according to each treatment specification [ 24,25 ] .
however , we also observed some variation in the antibiotic efficacy of different antibiotics .
thus , we evaluated the susceptibility and resistance profiles separately for each antibiotic .
nitrofurantoin was the most effective treatment against e. coli isolated from the urine samples and presented the lowest resistance rate .
nitrofurantoin was followed by ampicillin + sulbactam , the fluoroquinolones and , lastly , cephalothin , in terms of efficacy .
in assessing antibiotic efficacy over the period of the six years of the study , we observed a significant increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones ( ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin ) over time , which may be due to empirical treatment of urinary infections .
this effect was also reported in uruguay , a country with extensive use of fluoroquinolones as a form of empirical treatment for urinary infections [ 21 ] , as well as in another study highlighting the risk factors for urinary tract infections in ambulatory patients exhibiting microbial resistance to fluoroquinolones [ 26 ] .
the concern regarding microbiological resistance requires changes enabling preventive measures or the discovery of new therapeutic targets by the scientific community .
this is mainly owed to the studies showing a close relationship between the development of mechanisms of resistance and strategies that have been adopted for decades to restrain infectious processes [ 27,28 ] .
evidence of this problem are related to the increasing frequency of enterobacteriaceae resistant to to beta - lactamics or carbapenemics observed in recent years , which has also been extended to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones [ 29 ] .
our data corroborate the findings of these studies , as fluoroquinolones are the treatment of choice for urinary infections in brazilian states and are thus susceptible to factors associated with microbial resistance .
most importantly , we used the data on resistance to fluoroquinolones over the last six years to extrapolate the pattern of microbial resistance in the future. by this estimation , we have deduced that fluoroquinolones will no longer be effective against e. coli - based urinary infections in approximately 20 years if appropriate measures are not taken against the generalized misuse of antibiotics in empirical treatments .
one of the major reasons for such increases in resistance is the misapplication of antibiotics due to economic and social issues in some countries [ 12,13,14 ] .
we , therefore , investigated the costs of brand - name and generic versions of the five different antibiotics and observed discrepancies between the costs of various antibiotics .
the costs of the drugs are not only based on their efficacy , but are also related to the cost of production by different pharmaceutical companies .
this discrepancy , assessed by obtaining the mean of generic and brand - name drugs , extended to all antibiotics tested .
our results revealed a significantly lower cost for the acquisition of nitrofurantoin , followed by norfloxacin , ampicillin + sulbactam , ciprofloxacin and , finally , cephalothin .
costs for the generic versions of ampicillin + sulbactam and ciprofloxacin were not significantly different .
thus , our findings highlight the importance taking into account both the effectiveness of an antibiotic treatment and the cost for patients .
simoens [ 13 ] has discussed this topic , stating that physicians must consider these and others factors when prescribing an antibiotic and determining whether a specific antibiotic treatment adds enough value to justify extra costs .
still , in the 1980s , two aspects concerning microbial resistance were considered more relevant : the indication of inappropriate antibiotics for patients with nosocomial infections and the cost of antibiotics , where patients could receive antibiotics at lower cost [ 27 ] .
in this same study , the authors also pointed out that a high rate of subjects receiving antibiotic therapy with lower cost and , therefore , the implementation of computer programs with applications in hospital surveillance , would be necessary .
indeed , in addition to the misapplication of antibiotics due to economic and social issues , the elevated number of mutations in bacteria is a natural and inseparable factor for the occurrence of resistance .
hence , it is crucial to discuss the best approaches to choose which antibiotic will be used in the future , especially because there is an inverse relationship between the necessity of new antibiotics and the amount of newly discovered drugs of this class .
the results presented here are of major concern and a matter of debate for everyone involved in healthcare , especially considering the use of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of e. coli - based urinary infections .
clinicians must be careful regarding their choice of antibiotics considering costs and the occurrence of microbial resistance .
taken together these strategies may contribute to a more effective control of infections , thus reducing loss of life .
finally , new strategies aiming the treatment and control of bacterial infections are still needed .
these approaches may include the discovery of new medicines , vaccines , the control of hospital infections , and the rational use of existing antibiotics .
5. conclusions in summary , our data reveal the importance of evaluating the antibiotic susceptibility profile of patient e. coli samples in order to obtain the best strategy for empirical treatment of urinary infections .
we recommend that clinicians take into account not only the effectiveness of specific antibiotics but also the actual costs to the patient when determining the best course of treatment .

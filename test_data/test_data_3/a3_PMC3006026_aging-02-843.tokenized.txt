mitochondrial metabolism appears critical to sustain cardiac function to counteract aging .
in this study , we generated mice transgenically over - expressing the mitochondrial protein frataxin , which promotes mitochondrial energy conversion by controlling iron - sulfur - cluster biogenesis and hereby mitochondrial electron flux .
hearts of transgenic mice displayed increased mitochondrial energy metabolism and induced stress defense mechanisms , while overall oxidative stress was decreased .
following standardized exposure to doxorubicin to induce experimental cardiomyopathy , cardiac function and survival was significantly improved in the transgenic mice .
the insulin / igf - 1 signaling cascade is an important pathway that regulates survival following cytotoxic stress through the downstream targets protein kinase b , akt , and glycogen synthase kinase 3 .
activation of this cascade is markedly inhibited in the hearts of wild - type mice following induction of cardiomyopathy. by contrast , transgenic overexpression of frataxin rescues impaired insulin / igf - 1 signaling and provides a mechanism to explain enhanced cardiac stress resistance in transgenic mice .
taken together , these findings suggest that increased mitochondrial metabolism elicits an adaptive response due to mildly increased oxidative stress as a consequence of increased oxidative energy conversion , previously named mitohormesis .
this in turn activates protective mechanisms which counteract cardiotoxic stress and promote survival in states of experimental cardiomyopathy .
thus , induction of mitochondrial metabolism may be considered part of a generally protective mechanism to prevent cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure .
oxphos cardiac failure cardiomyopathy insulin signaling mitohormesis introduction cardiac failure ( cf ) is one leading cause of death [ 1 ] , and its prevalence increases with age [ 1 ] .
more than seven decades ago it was proposed that the failing heart and its associated state , cf , might be caused by energy starvation [ 2 ] .
since then , a large set of published evidence has discussed the paramount importance of mitochondrial malfunction in the pathogenesis as well as late stages of cardiac failure [ 3,10 ] .
in recent years , much attention has been attributed to the dysfunction of mitochondrial energy metabolism , which has not only been associated with cf but also to numerous other disorders , such as cancer , diabetes , obesity and general senescence .
the mitochondrion hosts the enzymes of the krebs cycle and the complexes of the electron transport chain ( etc ) which generate atp by oxidation of carbohydrates , fatty acids and amino acids .
it therefore functions as the foremost supplier of energy substrate to maintain systemic energy balance and homeostasis .
the protein frataxin acts as an important regulator of mitochondrial energy metabolism [ 11 ] which is highly expressed in metabolically active tissues such as brain , liver , skeletal and cardiac muscle [ 12 ] .
it is a nuclear encoded protein which , after n - terminal signal peptide cleavage , is located within the mitochondrial matrix .
recent studies demonstrate that frataxin is an important regulator of iron metabolism and storage within the mitochondria , and a key factor of iron - sulphur - cluster ( isc ) synthesis [ 13 ] .
friedreich 's ataxia ( frda ) , the most prevalent form of inherited neurodegenerative diseases , is caused by severely reduced expression of frataxin [ 14 ] .
primary symptoms are limb and gait ataxia , muscular atrophy and subsequent limb failure , carbohydrate intolerance , diabetes , and severe cardiomyopathy .
eventually , cf is fatal at an average age of 37 years [ 14 ] .
a mouse model of frataxin - deficiency in the heart demonstrates a similar phenotype with cardiac hypertrophy and early adult lethality [ 15 ] .
these findings are supported by the notion that cardiac dysfunction is generally associated with impaired mitochondrial energy conversion and increased formation of ros [ 5,16 ] .
we now have generated a mouse model with transgenic over - expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin to address our hypothesis that constitutive activation of mitochondrial energy metabolism might reduce the incidence of experimental cf. we employed doxorubicin ( dox ) , also used as an anticancer drug in human medicine , to induce experimental cardio - myopathy .
dox is known to cause cf in humans once exceeding a cumulative dose threshold [ 17 ] .
this in turn led to the use of dox in a long - standing and standardized mouse model of cardiomyopathy , where a single injection of dox primarily affects the myocardium and causes severe and potentially lethal cf [ 18,19 ] .
we here show that transgenic activation of mitochondrial energy metabolism in the heart significantly reduces mortality in a model of dox - induced cardiomyopathy .
results generation of a mouse model with frataxin over - expression for the purposes of this study we generated a transgenic mouse model over - expressing the mitochondrial protein frataxin .
a cdna encoding for human frataxin under the control of a ubiquitously active promoter was introduced into the murine genome to achieve a generally elevated expression of frataxin that , due to a hemagglutinin - tag , is distinguishable from expression of endogenous protein .
we originally obtained 3 founder animals out of which only one was fertile and transmitted the transgene through the germ line .
after confirmation of transgene presence in the genome by transgene - specific genomic pcr , we determined protein expression levels in various tissues ( figure 1a ) .
although a ubiquitously active promoter was used ( see methods ) , transgenic frataxin expression unexpectedly was restricted to a subset of tissues .
expression was found to be highest in heart , spleen , thymus and lung , where aside from the mature , processed 18 kd form of frataxin , a precursor of frataxin , sized 22 kd , could be detected through immunoblotting of the hemagglutinin - tagged transgene ( figure 1a ) .
while brain , skeletal muscle and kidney also expressed transgenic frataxin ( figure 1a ) , expression was barely detectable in others , such as liver and brown adipose tissue ( figure 1a ) .
frataxin over - expression promotes cardiac mito - chondrial energy conversion we subsequently moved on to investigate possible phenotypic changes in the heart , as this tissue usually displays the most profound aberrations in frda patients [ 14 ] .
to investigate whether over - expression of frataxin in an animal model leads to similar changes in energy metabolism as previously reported in in vitro models [ 11,20 ] , we determined activity of aconitase ( figure 1b ) , a krebs cycle enzyme that is known to depend on isc and hence frataxin expression .
moreover , aconitase catalyzes the initial conversion step of citric acid to isocitric acid in the krebs cycle and therefore represents an important step of mitochondrial substrate oxidation .
animals over - expressing frataxin showed a trend towards elevated levels of aconitase activity when compared to wild - type littermates ( figure 1b ) ( p = 0.0528 ) .
the levels of atp , nadh , nadph and reduced glutathione ( gsh ) in hearts of wild - type and transgenic littermate animals were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) ( figures 1c - f ) .
levels of atp , nadh and nadph were significantly increased in animals over - expressing frataxin ( figures 1c - e ) indicating an increase in mitochondrial energy conversion and mitochondrial efficiency .
we next hypothesized that an apparent induction of mitochondrial energy conversion might lead to an overall increase in oxidative damage .
however , the concentration of gsh , which constitutes an important fuel to drive antioxidative protection of cellular structure , was found to be increased in animals over - expressing frataxin ( figure 1f ) .
similarly , thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( tbars ) , which represent a measure of cellular lipid peroxidation , were significantly decreased in transgenic animals ( figure 1g ) .
taken together , over - expression of frataxin promotes activity of isc - dependent aconitase activity , elevates levels of metabolic intermediates of increased energy conversion , promotes glutathione - based ros defense and , despite this increase in mitochondrial activity , decreases markers of oxidative stress .
activation of mitochondrial metabolism counteracts cardiomyopathy and reduces mortality as frataxin has been implicated in maintenance of cardiac function , we questioned whether frataxin over - expression might in turn lead to improved performance of the heart under conditions of myocardial damage , namely an application of a single dose of dox to induce cf. we investigated whether frataxin might contribute to improved function of the heart .
hemodynamic parameters of control and transgenic hearts was assayed to monitor cardiac performance of animals either left untreated or following dox administration .
in the basal state , no differences in any of the hemodynamic parameters could be observed when comparing wild - type and transgenic animals that had not received dox ( table 1 ) .
however , when animals were challenged with dox prior to the measurements , transgenic animals displayed markedly improved cardiac performance .
left ventricular contraction during systole and the ventricular relaxation during diastole , end - systolic and end - diastolic pressure ( pes and ped ) as well as maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise ( dp / dtmax ) and fall ( dp / dtmin ) indicate contractility of the ventricle .
rates of ventricular pressure rise and decline were significantly improved in the hearts of transgenic animals ( figures 2a and b ) .
a significant improvement was also observed in pes and end - systolic volume ( ves ) ( figures 2c and d ) .
on the other hand , no changes could be detected in the equivalent end - diastolic functions end - diastolic pressure ( ped ) and end - diastolic volume ( ved ) ( figures 2e and f ) .
tau ( tau ) , the time constant of iso - volumetric left ventricular pressure decline was not changed significantly ( figure 2g ) .
on the other hand , parameters of overall cardiac performance , i.e. stroke work , beat volume , cardiac output , ejection fraction and heart rate were all significantly increased in hearts with frataxin over - expression following administration of dox ( figures 2h - l ) .
most importantly and in accordance with these findings , we observed a significantly decreased rate of mortality in frataxin over - expressing animals compared to wild - type littermates after dox exposure ( p = 0.033 ) ( figure 3 ) .

we therefore quantified expression of components of the insulin signaling pathway in frataxin - transgenic animals before and after exposure to doxorubicin .
using immunoblotting , we analyzed expression and phosphorylation levels of ir and igf - 1r , as well as their downstream targets akt ( protein kinase b ) , glycogen synthase kinase - 3alpha / beta ( gsk - 3alpha / beta ) and glycogen synthase ( gs ) .
expression as well phosphorylation levels of these proteins remained unchanged in frataxin - transgenic animals as compared to untreated controls in the pre - dox state ( figure 4 ) .

membranes were probed with the indicated antibody , then stripped and re - probed with alpha - tubulin as loading control .

administration of dox to wild - type animals , however , lead to a marked reduction in phosphorylation levels of ir and igf - 1r ( figures 4a and b ) , as well as their downstream targets akt and gsk - 3alpha / beta ( figures 4c to f ) .
phosphorylation of gsk - 3alpha / beta negatively regulates the activity of this kinase .
accordingly , phosphorylation of gs was found to be increased in wild - type animals exposed to dox , which is known to inhibit the activity of this enzyme ( figure 4g ) .
meanwhile , under conditions of frataxin over - expression , we observed a reversal of the dox - induced changes in wild - type animals .
we here observed increased phosphorylation levels of the upstream insulin signaling components ir , igf - 1r and akt ( figures 4a - e ) as well as the downstream kinase gsk - 3alpha / beta ( figure 4f ) .
according - ly , phosphorylation of gs was reduced to levels observed in the untreated hearts ( figure 4g ) .
taken together , dox - induced cardiomyopathy , cardiac function and survival was significantly improved in frataxin - transgenic mice compared to wild - type littermates .
activation of the insulin / igf - 1 signaling cascade is markedly inhibited in the hearts of wild - type mice following induction of cardiomyopathy .
importantly , transgenic overexpression of frataxin rescues the loss of insulin / igf - 1 signaling and provides a mechanism to explain enhanced cardiac stress resistance in the transgenic mice .
discussion we previously demonstrated that expression of frataxin correlates with mitochondrial energy metabolism in vitro and in vivo , affecting processes as diverse as longevity , diabetes , as well as growth and formation of cancer cells [ 11,20 - 23 ] .
therefore , we here have generated a transgenic mouse model with forced expression of frataxin .
frataxin - transgenic mice display increased mitochondrial energy metabolism in the heart , which - consistent with previously published in vitro data [ 24 ] - was accompanied by reduced oxidative stress .
these observations indicate that over - expression of frataxin in the heart improves mitochondrial energy conversion while it reduces the amount of ros produced during electron transport .
following the injection of dox to induce cf we observe significantly improved cardiac function and survival in mice transgenically expressing frataxin .
moreover , we here show that activation of mitochondrial metabolism is able to sustain activation of the akt / pkb survival pathway through the insulin / igf - 1 receptor signaling axis under conditions of ros - induced cardiomyopathy .
previous findings in cells , nematodes , knock - out mice and possibly humans demonstrate that frataxin expression tightly correlates with mitochondrial activity [ 11,20 - 23,25,26 ] .
furthermore , we and others were able to show that increased formation of ros can expedite health - promoting effects by inducing a hormetic response which in turn leads to improved stress resistance and / or ros defense capacity ( reviewed in [ 27 ]) .
in particular , this has been shown for frataxin - overexpressing cells which , similarly to the transgenic mice studied in this manuscript , exhibit reduced ros levels and increased gsh levels despite increased mitochondrial metabolism [ 24 ] .
we therefore hypothesize that frataxin acts similar to physical exercise [ 28 ] through transiently increased ros formation by subsequently promoting mitochondrial hormesis or ' mitohormesis' [ 27 ] ( figure 5 ) .
figure 5 .
activation of mitochondrial metabolism induces mitohormesis , hereby increasing stress resistance and survival of cardiomyopathy .
it is well established that activation of insulin / igf - 1 receptor signaling exerts cardioprotective action [ 29 - 31 ] .
reduced insulin sensitivity and diabetes have been associated with increased incidence of cf [ 31 ] while cardiac muscle appears to respond to impaired insulin signaling by inducing mitochondrial biogenic response [ 32 ] .
in the same line , treatment of rats with igf - 1 protects from cardiomyopathy induced by dox [ 33 ] , and expression of igf - 1 and its receptor is increased in rat hearts following physical exercise [ 34,35 ] .
mice carrying a deletion of both ir and igf - 1r in the skeletal muscle and heart display a severe impairment of cardiac function and die of heart failure four weeks after birth .
moreover , these animals display reduced expression levels of genes of the etc and especially mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation , not only suggesting that insulin signaling plays an essential role on heart physiology but also is an important regulator of mitochondrial energy metabolism [ 36 ] .
activation of the akt / pkb survival pathway has repeatedly been implicated in improved outcome following myocardial infarction .
the anti - apoptotic function of akt / pkb seems to be of particular importance to guarantee sustained heart contractility and function following reperfusion of the infarct region [ 37 - 39 ] .
conversely , over - expression of constitutively active akt / pkb results in marked cardiac hypertrophy and other cardiac complications .
interestingly , and regardless of the negative growth characteristics , akt / pkb - transgenic animals displayed significantly reduced infarct size following ischemia / reperfusion [ 40 ] .
in accordance with our findings , it could be demonstrated earlier that dox reduces akt / pkb signaling [ 41,42 ] .
moreover , virus - mediated expression of akt1 in mouse hearts ameliorated the effects of dox - induced cardiomyopathy [ 43 ] .
another interesting line of evidence links reduced activity of the downstream target of akt / pkb , gsk - 3alpha / beta , to cardioprotection .
following treatment with the polyphenolic compound resveratrol , gsk - 3alpha / beta is inhibited via phosphorylation [ 44 ] .
resveratrol protects the heart by a preconditioning mechanism acting though nitric oxide signaling [ 45 ] , a process strikingly resembling the principle of hormesis .
resveratrol has been implicated in eliciting a hormetic effect in the process of ' xenohormesis' [ 46 ] .
in summary , we observe a consistent reduction of insulin / igf - 1 receptor signaling and reduced akt / pkb phosphorylation , which has been previously reported following administration of dox .
the findings altogether indicate that over - expression of frataxin , due to its function as an activator of mitochondrial energy metabolism , rescues the dox - induced down - regulation of insulinigf - 1 signaling .
moreover , we propose that mitochondrial metabolism , by primarily producing increased amounts of ros , elicits a mitohormetic response which activates defense mechanisms in the heart .
this effect may help to prevent cardiomyopathy and result in improved survival following treatmentwith dox ( figure 5 ) .
plausible future approaches for finding novel treatments of cf would therefore include the search for novel compounds that can enhance mitochondrial metabolism to induce such a mitohormetic response [ 4 ] .
materials and methods generation of frataxin - overexpressing animals the cdna encoding for the human frataxin protein was obtained and fused to a c - terminal hemagglutinin - tag as previously described [ 11 ] .
the cdna ( deposited at addgene for public access ) was cloned into the ncoi and ecori restriction sites of the pdrive - cag vector ( invivogen , san diego , ca , usa ) , which has been designed for ubiquitous expression in the mouse , hereby also replacing the original lacz encoding sequence .
the vector was then digested with the restriction enzymes swai and psti to remove vector backbone and obtain the purified transgene construct for injection into the male pre - nucleus of fertilized murine oocytes derived from pure c57bl / 6 mice .
all subsequent breedings were performed with c57bl / 6 wild - type animals to maintain a homogenous genetic background .
offspring was genotyped for integration of the transgene as described below .
f1 offspring animals were genotyped to verify transmission through the germ line .
one founder animal with stable and heritable expression of the transgene could be obtained , which was subsequently used to generate a mouse colony with stable over - expression of the frataxin protein .
all animal experiments ( generation of transgenes , maintenance and dox experiments ) were performed after approval by the corresponding institutional review boards .
animal maintenance animals were housed and maintained as described before [ 23 ] .
for all experiments male animals at an age of 12 - 16 weeks were used .

thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( tbars ) quantification was performed exactly as described previously [ 22 ] .
doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy doxorubicin - induced cardiomyopathy was induced by intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin ( doxo cell , cell pharm , germany , 20 mg / kg ) in 24 mice with transgenic overexpression of frataxin ( fx ) and in 24 wild - type littermates ( wt ) .
the investigation conformed to the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals published by the us national institutes of health ( nih publication no. 85 - 23 , revised 1985 ) .
surgical procedures and hemodynamic measurements left ventricular ( lv ) function was analyzed using pressure - volume loops .
the animals were anesthetized ( thiopental 125 mg / kg i.p. ) , intubated , and artificially ventilated .
as described recently [ 48 ] , a 1.4 f micro - conductance pressure catheter ( sciesence , ontario , canada ) was positioned in the left ventricle for registration of lv pressure - volume ( pv ) loops in a closed - chest model .
indices of cardiac function were derived from pv data .
systolic function was quantified by lv end - systolic pressure ( lvp , mmhg ) , dp / dt max ( mmhg / s ) and by ejection fraction ( ef , %) .
global cardiac function was quantified by the end systolic volume ( esv , mul ) , end diastolic volume ( edv , mul ) stroke volume ( sv , mul ) , cardiac output ( co , mul / min ) , and heart rate ( hr , beat / min ) .
diastolic function was measured by lv end - diastolic pressure ( lvedp , mmhg ) , dp / dt min ( mmhg / s ) , and the iso - volumetric relaxation time tau ( ms ) .
immunodetection detection of the various proteins by western blot was performed as described before [ 20 ] .
monoclonal antibodies were : hemagglutinin ( clone 12ca5 ) ( roche , mannheim , germany ) , basal insulin receptor beta , tyr1135 / 1136 phosphorylated igf - 1 receptor beta , and tyr - 1150 / 51 phosphorylated insulin receptor beta , basal glycogen synthase kinase alpha / beta , and ser21 / 9 phosphorylated glycogen kinase alpha / beta ( all from cell signaling inc , danvers , ma , usa ) .
polyclonal antibodies were : basal akt , ser308 phosphorylated akt , ser473 phosphorylated akt , basal glycogen synthase , ser641 phosphorylated glycogen synthase ( all from cell signaling inc. ) and alpha - tubulin ( sigma - aldrich gmbh , munchen , germany ) .

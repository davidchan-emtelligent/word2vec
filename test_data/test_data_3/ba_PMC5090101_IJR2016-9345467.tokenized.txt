multivariate analysis found no correlation between anti - inflammatory drug intake and diagnosis delay , clinical presentation , complications , or outcome. conclusion .
anti - inflammatory drugs intake does not affect diagnostic delay , severity at diagnosis , or complications of pvo .
1. introduction pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis ( pvo ) is a rare disease : its incidence is estimated at 4 to 10 per 100 000 inhabitants per year in high - income countries [ 1 , 2 ] and has risen in recent years [ 3 - 5 ] .
the clinical diagnosis of pvo is difficult : half of patients are not febrile , and back pain , which is the most frequent symptom , is quite common in general population [ 5 ] .
the low incidence and the nonspecific clinical presentation of the disease can contribute to empirical prescriptions of anti - inflammatory drugs , especially when patients have a back pain antecedent .
we studied the impact of these medications on diagnosis delay , clinical presentation at hospitalization , and prevalence of complications ( systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) , neurologic deficit , and positive blood culture ) among patients with pvo .
2. material and methods 2.1 .
study settings we performed a prospective study enrolling 79 patients with pvo .
patients were part of a multicenter , open - label , noninferiority , randomized , control trial studying antibiotic treatment duration in pvo [ 5 ] .
patients of our study were the first 79 patients included in this trial in the 2 main recruiting centers ( university hospital of garches and university hospital of tours ) from november 15 , 2006 , to november 15 , 2010 .
inclusion criteria were the following : ( 1 ) clinical symptoms suggestive of pvo ; ( 2 ) diagnosis of pvo assessed by mri , ct scan , and / or bone scintigraphy ; and ( 3 ) reliable microbiological identification defined as a positive bacterial culture of , at least , one deep sample ( blood culture or vertebral biopsy ) .
if the microorganism was a potential contaminant , 2 deep positive samples with a concordant identification were required .
exclusion criteria were undocumented or nonpyogenic pvo or pvo on orthopedic device .
2.2 .
ethical committee the french data protection agency ( cnil ) and the institutional review board of versailles university hospital ( authorization number 06030 ) approved the protocol .
the study was done in accordance with the ethical principles of the declaration of helsinki and the guidelines for good clinical practice .
written informed consent for participation in the trial was obtained from all patients .
2.3 .
data collection patient characteristics , clinical signs , radiological results , and microbiological identification were prospectively gathered .
the c - reactive protein ( crp ) dosages and positive blood culture were recorded on the first day of hospitalization .
past medical history and anamnestic data since the beginning of symptoms were collected at admission in hospital : date of onset of symptoms and initial clinical presentation ( fever defined as temperature > 38degreesc and presence of pain ) .
nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) and corticosteroids intake ( without quantitative details ) were recorded from the patient and general practitioner interviews .
2.4 .
definitions diagnostic delay ( dd ) was defined as the time ( day ) from the first symptoms to diagnosis .
chronical back pain was defined as pain lasting for more than 3 months .
rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , and lupus were defined as inflammatory rheumatism .
neoplasia history included solid or hematological current neoplasia .
neuropathy history included all the sensitive or motor neurological involvement ( proved diabetic neuropathy , paraplegia , multiple sclerosis , etc. ) .
drugs abusers were active intravenous drug abusers .
minor neurocognitive impairment was a notion related by the general practitioner .
2.5 .
objectives the objectives were to determine the impact of anti - inflammatory drug intake on diagnosis delay , clinical presentation at hospitalization , incidence of complications ( systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) and neurologic deficit ) and cure rate among pvo cases .
2.6 .
patient groups we divided the patients into 4 groups : group 1 , patients without anti - inflammatory drug intake ; group 2 , patients who took anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids or corticosteroids ) ; group 3 , patients who only used nsaids ; and group 4 , patients who only used corticosteroids .
2.7 .
statistical analysis all continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range , and the categorical variables are presented as frequencies .
first , univariate analysis was performed , studying correlations between nsaids , corticosteroids , any anti - inflammatory drugs intake , and diagnosis delay , clinical presentation at hospitalization , and incidence of complications of pvo in patients , using student 's t - test for continuous variables and pearson 's chi 2 or fischer exact test for categorical variables .
then , a multivariate analysis was performed with logistic models regression to study impact of nsaids , corticosteroids , and any anti - inflammatory drugs intake with different parameters of clinical significance as endpoints : diagnosis delay , fever at diagnosis , presence of sirs , motor weakness , positive blood culture , and cure rate .
all reported probability values ( p values ) were based on two - sided tests , and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
all analyses were performed using the statistical package for social science ( spss ) version 17.0 ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) .
3. results overall , 79 patients were included ; 71 % were men .
mean age was 69 years old .
characteristics of study population are described in table 1. of the 79 patients , 45 ( 57.0 %) patients had neither nsaid nor corticosteroid intake , while 34 ( 43.0 %) received anti - inflammatory drugs prior to pvo diagnosis , with 26 ( 32.9 %) patients taking nsaids , 14 ( 17 %) taking corticosteroids , and 6 ( 7.5 %) using both .
pvo predominantly affected the lumbar and lumbosacral spine in over 68 % of cases and in 24 % of cases for the thoracic spine and in 20 % of cases for the cervical spine .
multiple localizations were found in 17 % of cases .
staphylococcus spp. were nearly half of pathogens identified , streptococcus spp. were identified in 22 % of cases , and enterobacteriaceae were identified in about 13 % of cases .
the mean level of c - reactive protein ( crp ) at diagnosis was 114 mg / l and 78 % of patients had positive blood cultures .
univariate analysis found no significant difference between the four study groups considering the characteristics of the population and of the pvo ( localization and microbiological identification ) , diagnosis delay , motor weakness , crp level and positive blood culture at diagnosis , and outcome ( table 1 ) .
the only significant difference found was that patients who took anti - inflammatory drugs had more painful symptoms and were less febrile , especially patients who only used nsaids .
multivariate analysis found no correlation between any anti - inflammatory drug intake and fever , diagnosis delay , sirs , motor weakness , positive blood culture , or cure rate .
4. discussion our study population is similar to previous descriptions in literature , regarding age , localization of pvo , proportion of positive blood culture , and microorganisms involved [ 1 - 3 , 5 ] .
despite easier access to mri than in the 90s , diagnosis delay is still long : 30 days in median in our study .
nsaids are the most commonly prescribed painkillers for back pain , even when the pain 's mechanical nature is still uncertain [ 6 ] .
thus , in the case of pvo where pain is the main suggestive symptom , this class of drugs could be misused and could modify its clinical presentation .
therefore , the diagnosis might be delayed and could be made at the late stage of neurological complications or severe sepsis .
furthermore , by its own anti - inflammatory action , it could be responsible for severe presentation .
however , our study did not find any statistically significant difference considering diagnosis delay , neurological complication , positive blood culture , or cure rate among patients with or without nsaids or corticosteroids consumption .
we only noted that patients taking anti - inflammatory drugs felt more pain .
obviously , patients are more subject to using anti - inflammatory drugs in case of painful symptoms .
thus , the prescription of anti - inflammatory drugs ( mainly nsaid ) to patients complaining from back pain will not delay the diagnosis of an eventual pvo , nor will it lead to a more severe clinical picture .
moreover , we found that patients with any anti - inflammatory drugs intake , especially nsaids , were less febrile .
hence , physicians should suspect pvo in the presence of back pain , especially if this symptom is persistent and not well controlled by pain killers .
several studies have shown that nsaids use could be significantly associated with a more severe presentation of bacterial infectious disease , with a reduced chemotactism of neutrophils shown in vitro [ 7 - 10 ] .
according to experimental models it could be due to late diagnosis created by nsaids intake instead of their anti - inflammatory activity [ 11 ] .
also , the in vivo effect of nsaids on granulocyte function and cytokines is controversial .
it has been described that ibuprofen increases endotoxin - induced tnfalpha and polymorphonuclear leukocyte degranulation in vivo [ 12 ] .
here , anti - inflammatory drugs seem not to be an aggravating circumstance .
this can be explained by the chronic characteristic of bone and joint infection , particularly pvo , and the usual slow replication of microorganism .
to our knowledge , our study is the first that studied the impact of anti - inflammatory drugs on the diagnosis delay and complications of pvo .
although our study was conducted on a small number of patients and nsaids and corticosteroid intake were retrospectively collected and only qualitative , our results are reassuring .
ethically , no trial could be performed on this topic and we need large cohorts to confirm these preliminary data .
nevertheless , we still have to be precautious about prescribing nsaids or corticosteroids for back pain if pvo is not formally excluded .
5. conclusion intake of anti - inflammatory drugs does not seem to have any significant impact on the diagnosis delay of pvo , the severity of its presentation , the incidence of its complications , and outcome .
they could be prescribed for afebrile back pain , even if it is due to pvo .
further data are needed to confirm this trend due to our limited sample size and low statistical power .

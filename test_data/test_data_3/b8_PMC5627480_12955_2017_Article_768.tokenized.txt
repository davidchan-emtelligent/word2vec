background disputes exist regarding the psychometric properties of the oswestry disability index ( odi ) .
the present study was to examine the reliability , validity , and dimensionality of a chinese version of the odi version 2.1 in a sample of 225 adult orthopedic outpatients with chronic low back pain [ mean age ( sd ) : 40.7 ( 11.4 ) years ] .
methods we conducted reliability analysis , exploratory bifactor analysis , confirmatory factor analysis , and mokken scale analysis of the odi .
to validate the odi , we used the short - form 36 questionnaire ( sf - 36 ) and visual analog scale ( vas ) .
results the reliability , and discriminant and construct validities of the odi was good .
the fit statistics of the unidimensional model of the odi were inadequate .
the odi was a weak mokken scale ( hs = 0.31 ) .
conclusions the odi was a reliable and valid scale suitable for measurement of disability in patients with low back pain .
but the odi seemed to be multidimensional that was against the use of the raw score of the odi as a measurement of disability .

the level of disability in patients with lbp is an important outcome measure for clinical practice and research [ 2 ] .
the oswestry disability index ( odi ) is one of the most commonly used scales that assess the disability related to lbp [ 2 , 3 ] .
the scoring of the odi is the simple sum score of the items of the odi multiplied by two [ 3 ] .
the derived score of the odi is a measurement of the level of disability related to lbp [ 3 ] .
but the items of the odi are ordinal measurements .
to use the raw score of the odi as a valid measurement , three assumptions are required : ( 1 ) the odi is unidimensional ; ( 2 ) all the items of the odi are equally correlated with the measured construct ( i.e. lbp - related disability ) ; and ( 3 ) the point intervals are equal on the odi [ 4 ] .
but these assumptions are typically unchecked and unjustified [ 4 ] .
hence , to use the raw score of the odi as a measurement , it is necessary to check whether the odi meets these assumptions .
disputes exist in the psychometric properties of the odi .
first , the construct and transcultural validities of the odi are uncertain [ 5 ] .
second , the unidimensionality of the odi is conflicting [ 6 , 7 ] .
several items of the odi poorly fit unidimensionality [ 6 - 8 ] .
third , the odi appears to have a floor effect that the odi poorly differentiates patients with little disability [ 6 , 7 , 9 ] .
fourth , the odi also has a ceiling effect that limits differentiating patients with high disability [ 6 , 7 , 9 ] .
such disputes suggest the raw score of the odi is problematic .
lue et al .
( 2008 ) developed the chinese version of the odi 2.1 , and claimed that the odi was unidimensional solely based upon its chronbach 's alpha was 0.90 [ 10 ] .
such argument is false because cronbach 's alpha does not measure dimensionality .
cronbach 's alpha is a measure of the mean inter - item covariance and the number of items [ 11 ] .
no clear relationship exists between cronbach 's alpha and the dimensionality of a scale [ 11 ] .
lue et al .
( 2013 ) has shown that the odi fitted the rasch model , and they suggested that the odi is a unidimensional scale [ 7 ] .
but in that study [ 7 ] , the majority ( 6 of 10 ) of the items of the odi violated monotonicity , suggesting that the odi might be a multidimensional scale .
the present study was to address two research questions of the chinese version of the odi 2.1 : is the odi a unidimensional scale ? is the odi reliable and valid for measuring disability in adult orthopedic outpatients with chronic lbp ?
methods participants we re - analysed the data from a cross - sectional sample of adult orthopedic outpatients with chronic lbp in taiwan [ 12 ] .
this study was conducted in the general orthopedics clinic of the chang gung memorial hospital , linkou , from august 2008 to november 2010 , and was approved by the institutional review board of the same hospital .
inclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) 20 - 65 years of age , and ( 2 ) chronic lbp that was defined as lbp for at least 3 months .
exclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) receiving antidepressant or antipsychotic medication during the preceding 4 weeks , ( 2 ) psychotic symptoms , ( 3 ) mental retardation , and ( 4 ) severe cognitive impairment .
all participants gave written informed consent before study enrollment .
the sample consisted of 225 patients [ mean age ( sd ) : 40.7 ( 11.4 ) years ; 103 ( 45.8 %) females ] .
as for comorbid mental illness per the dsm - iv criteria [ 13 ] , 49 ( 21.8 %) had major depressive disorder and 52 ( 23.1 %) had at least one anxiety disorder .
83 ( 36.9 %) patients had severe lbp .
instruments the oswestry disability index ( odi ) the odi consists of 10 items on the degree of severity to which back ( or leg ) trouble has affected the ability to manage in everyday life [ 3 ] .
the 10 sections cover the pain and the daily function ( including pain intensity , personal hygiene , lifting , walking , sitting , standing , sleeping , sexual activity , social activity , and traveling ) .
each item is rated on a 6 - point scale ( 0 - 5 ) ; the higher score means the higher level of disability related to lbp .
the present study used the traditional chinese version of the odi 2.1 [ 10 ] .
the short - form 36 questionnaire ( sf - 36 ) the sf - 36 consists of 36 items for measuring the general health status of patients [ 14 ] .
the sf - 36 has 8 subscales as follows : physical functioning ( pf ) , role limitations due to physical health problems ( role - physical , rp ) , bodily pain ( bp ) , general health ( gh ) , vitality ( vt ) , social functioning ( sf ) , role limitation due to emotional problems ( role - emotional , re ) and mental health ( mh ) .
each subscale is rated on a scale of 0 - 100 ; the higher score means the better health status .
we used the traditional chinese version of the sf - 36 [ 15 ] .
we adopted two kinds of aggregate scoring of the sf - 36 .
first , according to the medical outcomes study conceptual model , the physical health score ( phs ) is derived from the sum of pf , rp , bp , and gh ; the mental health score ( mhs ) is derived from the sum of vt , sf , re , and mh [ 14 , 16 ] .
second , the standard physical component summary ( pcs ) and mental health component summary ( mcs ) scores were calculated with the formulae available in the study by leese et al .

in this study , vas >= 7 was considered to indicate severe pain .
statistical analysis we conducted all analyses in r version 3.3.1 [ 18 ] .
the p - values were two - tailed with the significance level of 0.05 .
we summarized the item statistics of the odi with the likert package [ 19 ] .
reliability to assess the reliability of the odi , we used the psych package for getting four coefficients as follows : cronbach 's alpha , revelle 's beta , and mcdonald 's omegat and omegah [ 20 , 21 ] .
revelle 's beta refers to the worst split - half reliability .
the coefficient omegat refers to the amount of reliable variance in a scale .
the coefficient omegah refers to an estimate of the general factor saturation of a scale .
as for each of the four coefficients of a scale , a value of 0.7 or higher marks good reliability .
also , the ordered sequence of the four coefficients offers insight into the dimensionality of a scale [ 21 ] .
for a unidimensional scale , omegah should be equal or greater than chronbach 's alpha [ 21 ] .
we took two steps to get the coefficients omegat and omegah of the odi .
first , we conducted parallel analysis of the odi data to decide the proper number of extracted factors .
second , we conducted exploratory bifactor analysis ( eba ) of the odi data to get omegat , omegah , and the explained common variance ( ecv ) for the general factor .
if the ecv is larger than 60 % , a unidimensional construct is confirmed [ 22 ] .
we obtained the corresponding 95 % bias - corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals of alpha , beta , omegat , omegah , and the ecv with 10,000 bootstrap replications with the boot package [ 23 , 24 ] .
convergent and discriminant validities to test the convergent validity of the unidimensional model of the odi , we conducted confirmatory factor analysis ( cfa ) with the lavaan and matrixpls packages [ 25 , 26 ] .
if the composite reliability ( cr ) is greater than 0.7 and the average variance extracted ( ave ) greater than 0.5 , then the convergent validity is confirmed [ 27 ] .
the cutoffs of model fit statistics are as follows : the root mean square error of approximation ( rmsea ) < 0.06 , the close fit ( cfit ) test that was non - significant ( i.e. , the probability value that the rmsea <= 0.05 was greater than 0.05 ) , the standardized root mean square residual ( srmr ) <= 0.05 , the weighted root mean square residual ( wrmr ) < 1.0 , the comparative fit index ( cfi ) >= 0.95 , and the tucker - lewis index ( tli ) >= 0.95 [ 28 - 30 ] .
to test the discriminant validity of the odi , we used the fornell - larcker criterion and the heterotrait - monotrait ( htmt ) ratio with the pcs and mcs of the sf - 36 [ 16 , 27 , 31 ] .
as for the fornell - larcker criterion , if the ave of the odi is larger than the squared correlations between the odi and the pcs and mcs of the sf - 36 , then the discriminant validity of the odi is confirmed .
as for the htmt ratio method , two criteria of discriminant validity are as follows : ( 1 ) the htmt ratio should be less than 0.85 ( htmt.85 ) , and ( 2 ) the 90 % normal bootstrap confidence should not include 1 ( htmtinference ) [ 23 , 24 , 31 ] .
we got the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals of cr , ave , and htmt ratios of the odi with 10,000 bootstrap replications [ 23 , 24 ] .
mokken scale analysis ( msa ) msa is one of non - parametric item response theory models and is useful for scrutinizing a scale [ 32 , 33 ] .
we conducted msa of the odi data with the mokken package [ 34 , 35 ] .
first , we got the three loevinger 's scalability coefficients ( h ) : item - pair ( h ij ) , item ( h i ) , and scale ( h s ) [ 34 - 36 ] .
the rules of thumb for the h values are as follows : a scale is weak if 0.3 <= h < 0.4 , moderate if 0.4 <= h < 0.5 , and strong if h >= 0.5 [ 34 - 36 ] .
second , we examined local independence with conditional association procedure , monotonicity with item - rest regression , and non - intersection with the restscore method [ 32 , 34 , 35 , 37 , 38 ] .
finally , we assessed item ordering with the manifest iio method and the backward selection procedure [ 34 ] .
next , we rated iio of the selected items on the coefficient h t [ 39 ] .
the rules of thumb for h t values are as follows : a weak iio if 0.3 <= h t < 0.4 , moderate if 0.4 <= h t < 0.5 , and strong if h t >= 0.5 .
we rated the reliability of a mokken scale on the latent class reliability coefficient ( lcrc ) [ 40 ] .
a reliable scale should have a lcrc >= 0.7 .
construct validity we calculated the pearson 's product - moment correlation coefficients between the odi and the sf - 36 aggregate scores [ i.e. phs , mhs , pcs , and mcs ] , and the vas .
as the odi is a scale of lbp - related disability , we hypothesized that the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between the odi and the physical domain ( i.e. the phs , pcs , and vas ) should be greater than those between the odi and the mental domain ( i.e. the mhs and mcs ) .
results table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample .
among the 225 patients , 49 ( 21.8 %) patients had major depressive disorder .
among them , 21 ( 42.9 %) patients were in a current major depressive episode , 21 ( 42.9 %) were in partial remission of depression , and 7 ( 14.3 %) were in full remission .
among the 225 patients , 149 ( 66.2 %) patients had abnormal radiographic findings .
96 ( 42.7 %) patients had associated leg symptoms , including leg radiation pain , leg numbness , intermittent claudication , and neurological deficits .
68 ( 30.2 %) patients had medical comorbidities .
table 2 shows the item statistics of the odi .
as for the combined proportion of response >= 3 ( i.e. at least moderate disability ) , the items 1 ( pain intensity ) , 6 ( standing ) , and 9 ( social activity ) were the highest among the 10 items of the odi .
table 3 shows the abridged summary of the odi , sf - 36 , and vas .
parallel analysis of the odi data revealed that the number of factor extracted should be four .
table 4 shows the summary of the reliability and validity statistics of the odi .
the odi had a cronbach 's alpha , a mcdonald 's omegat , and an lcrc greater than 0.7 , indicating the odi was reliable .
the odi was multidimensional according to the following criteria : ( 1 ) omegah was lower chronbach 's alpha ; ( 2 ) the ecv was below 60 % ; and ( 3 ) the fit statistics of the unidimensional model of the odi were inadequate .
the odi had poor discriminant validity with the pcs but good discriminant validity with the mcs of the sf - 36 .
the odi was a weak mokken scale ( h s = 0.31 ) .
table 5 shows the correlation coefficients between the odi and other scales .
the odi negatively correlated to the aggregate scores of the sf - 36 and positively to the vas .
table 6 shows the item scalability coefficients ( h i ) of the odi .
each item of the odi had no violation of local independence and monotonicity ; also , no serious violation of non - intersection existed .
the backward selection procedure of the odi removed 3 items (# 3 , 5 , and 7 ) .
the other 7 items had weak iio property ( h t = 0.36 ) .
the hierarchical item ordering of the 7 items was the ascending order of the mean scores of these items [ 2 ( personal hygiene ) , 10 ( traveling ) , 4 ( walking ) , 8 ( sexual life ) , 9 ( social life ) , and 1 ( pain intensity )] .

as for the dimensionality of the odi , our results largely opposed that the odi is a unidimensional scale .
on one hand , evidence for the odi as a multidimensional scale was as follows : ( 1 ) omegah was less than alpha [ 21 ] ; ( 2 ) the ecv was less than 60 % [ 22 ] ; ( 3 ) the odi had insufficient convergent validity ; and ( 4 ) the fit statistics of the unidimensional model of the odi were generally poor .
on the other hand , our msa shows that the odi was a weak mokken scale that supported the use of the raw score of the odi as valid ordinal personal measurement of disability [ 7 ] .
but a half of the odi items performed poorly in unidimensionality ( h i < 0.3 ) .
such results further signified the poor unidimensionality of the odi [ 6 , 8 ] .
the odi had good discriminant validity from the mcs and poor discriminant validity from the pcs .
such results supported that the odi is a construct of physical disability [ 3 ] .
the correlations between the odi , the aggregate scores of the sf - 36 , and the vas also supported that the odi is a measure of physical disability .
our results showed that the 7 items of the odi had weak iio property .
the iio property is a useful feature for measurement of disability .
for example , if a patient with lbp reports impaired personal hygiene , the patient would also suffer from disability of the other 6 items of the odi .
also , when a patient reports improved disability of pain intensity , the patient would have improved disability of the other 6 items of the odi .
besides , our results concurred with recent studies that the disability of personal hygiene is the most difficult item of the odi [ 7 ] .
our results have two implications for research of the odi .
first , the raw score of the odi might not be the ideal aggregate score of the odi .
alternative scoring methods of the odi include dividing the raw score into 5 categories , and using the individual items of the odi [ 3 ] .
second , further research should consider multidimensional scaling of the odi , for example , multidimensional scaling and item - response theory models [ 41 , 42 ] .
the present study has three limitations .
first , this was cross - sectional analysis of a single - site sample .
we were incapable of verifying test - retest reliability of the odi .
also , selection bias unavoidably existed .
second , the sample size was modest .
third , the original study was not designed to investigate the research questions addressed in the present study .
fourth , we did not include a reliable and valid assessment of personality disorders .
polatin et al .
( 1993 ) reported that the prevalence of at least one personality disorder was as high as 51 % among chronic lbp patients [ 43 ] .
hence , as regards psychological factors of chronic lbp , it is crucial to include assessment of personality disorder .
however , to the best of our knowledge , there is still a lack of a validated chinese version of the structured clinical interview for dsm - iv - tr axis ii personality disorders ( scid - ii ) , which is the standard assessment of personality disorders [ 44 ] .
hence , we cannot provide the prevalence of personality disorders in the study sample .
conclusions using multiple methods , we show that the odi was a reliable and valid scale suitable for measuring disability in patients with low back pain .
but the odi seemed to be a multidimensional scale that was against the use of the raw score of the odi as a measurement of disability .

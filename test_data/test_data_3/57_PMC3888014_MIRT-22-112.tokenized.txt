99mtc - pertechnetate scintigraphy plays an essential role in the management of a variety of thyroid and parathyroid disorders .
the authors report an unusual case of mediastinal tracer distribution of 99mtc - pertechnetate and 99mtc - mibi in relation to an oesophageal conduit following oesophago - gastrectomy and reconstructive surgery on thyroid scintigraphy .
this is a rare but important cause of diffuse mediastinal uptake on thyroid scintigraphy .
an awareness of abnormal anatomy as well as altered physiological tracer uptake would help to avoid any diagnostic pitfall .
conflict of interest : none declared .
esophagectomy scintigraphy mediastinum 99mtc - pertechnetate tissue distribution introduction in the management of thyroid and parathyroid disorders , 99mtc - pertechnetate scintigraphy and 99mtc - mibi scintigraphy are commonly used to image and localise the lesions .
however , the uptake of these tracers may not be organ specific to the target tissues of interest .
it is therefore important to recognize altered physiological and pathological tracer uptake patterns in the event of abnormal anatomy , often due to previous surgery .
we present a patient with an altered tracer uptake due to previous oesopho - gastric surgery in 99mtc - pertechnetate and 99mtc - mibi scintigraphy .
case report a 76 - year - old woman with elevated serum calcium ( 2.64 mmol / l ) and pth ( 177 pmol / l ) was referred to the nuclear medicine department for parathyroid imaging in order to pre - operatively localise a parathyroid adenoma .
she underwent early and delayed scanning of the neck and mediastinum after intravenous injection of 600 mbq 99mtc - methoxyisobutylisonitrile ( mibi ) .
the images showed uniform tracer uptake in the thyroid with a focus of abnormal activity below the lower pole of the left lobe .
in addition , faint , diffusely increased uptake was noted in the mediastinum to the right of midline ( figure 1 ) .
in an effort to exclude multinodular goitre as a cause of false positive parathyroid adenoma , a 99mtc - pertechnetate study was performed on a separate day .
this showed no abnormal uptake in the lower pole of the left lobe of thyroid thereby confirming the presence of a parathyroid adenoma .
further , there was persistent mediastinal activity , suggesting uptake in a hollow organ ( figure 2 ) .
this uptake remained unchanged , albeit with reduced intensity , on repeat imaging after the patient was given a glass of water to drink ( figure 3 ) .
review of the chest radiograph ( figure 4 ) and case notes revealed that the patient had previously undergone oesophago - gastrectomy and reconstructive surgery for a gastric pathology .
it was therefore concluded that the mediastinal uptake of pertechnetate observed in this patient was presumably due to ingested salivary activity in the oesophageal conduit .
as to the mediastinal 99mtc - mibi uptake , this has been earlier reported in a patient with oesophagitis ( 1 ) .
literature review and discussion 99mtc - pertechnetate scintigraphy has been invaluable in the management of a variety of thyroid and parathyroid disorders ( 2 ) .
a good understanding of the physiological distribution of the tracer is however important in identifying artefacts since most of them are caused by normal secretion into body fluids or tissues .
an awareness of the pathological conditions that produce unusual appearances may also help to avoid diagnostic pitfalls .
a wide spectrum of potentially misleading physiological and non - physiological process may cause mediastinal uptake on 99mtc - pertechnetate scintigraphy , most common conditions include substernal extension of the thyroid , secreted activity in the oesophagus , intrathoracic thyroid tissue , metaplastic gastric mucosa ( barrett 's oesophagus ) and gastric mucosa in hiatus hernia ( 3,4,5,6 ) .
other uncommon causes are : metastatic thyroid carcinoma , ingested activity in the oesophagus in achalasia , tumours with functioning thyroid tissue , thymoma and intrathoracic gastric cyst ( 7,8,9,10,11 ) .
99mtc - mibi is commonly used in myocardial perfusion scintigraphy ( 12 ) and in parathyroid scintigraphy ( 13 ) .
more recently it has also been applied in breast scintigraphy ( 14 ) .
it is considered that mibi is sequestered within the mitochondria ( 15 ) , therefore a tissue with a large number of mitochondria such as myocardial cells and oxyphil cells of abnormal parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism ( 16 ) may take up mibi avidly and retain longer .
interestingly , it has been long known that patients with oesophagitis may show a 99mtc mibi uptake along the oesophagus as an incidental finding in cardiac 99mtc mibi scintigraphy ( 17 ) .
evaluation of the usefulness of tc mibi scintigraphy to detect oesophagitis has been performed with relatively high sensitivity ( 100 %) and specificity ( 77 %) ( 1 ) .
in our case report , the patient had a previous oesophago - gastrectomy and hence was expected to have a degree of reflux oesophagitis .

the macro - reentrant circuit of isthmus - dependent atrial flutter ( afl ) is located in the right atrium around the tricuspid annulus .
high acute success and low recurrence rate makes isthmus ablation a definitive therapy for patients with only afl .
however , a review of the literature suggests that , different aspects of this macro - reentrant circuit are still not entirely understood , while new information continues to emerge .
the aim of this article is to discuss some gaps in our " complete " understanding of isthmus - dependent afl .
few hypotheses have been stated which are open to investigation .
atrial arrhythmia macro - reentry ablation " all scientific truth is conditioned by the state of the knowledge at the time of its announcement " ( william osler , md , frcs .
harvenian oration , royal college of physicians , 1906. ) a recent population - based us study suggested that the incidence of atrial flutter ( afl ) ranged from 5 / 100,000 in those < 50 years old to 587 / 100,000 in subjects older than 80 [ 1 ] .
further , men and individuals with pre - existing heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were at highest risk .
although the combination of multiple electrical cardioversion and serial anti - arrhythmic drug ( aad ) therapy is effective in maintaining sinus rhythm for a long time [ 2 ] , acute success (> 90 %) and a low recurrence rate (< 10 %) of radiofrequency ablation ( rfa ) makes the latter a compelling choice [ 3,4 ] .
intuitively therefore , it seems no longer necessary to dwell on the mechanisms of isthmus - dependent afl .
a review of the literature , however , suggests that , different aspects of the macro - reentrant circuit of this potentially curable atrial arrhythmia are not entirely understood , while new information continues to emerge .
the aim of this article is to discuss some gaps in our " complete " understanding of isthmus - dependent afl .
few hypotheses have been stated which are open to investigation .
how well do we understand the re - entrant right atrial ( ra ) activation during isthmus - dependent afl ?
the question is , does a large ra circuit such as typical afl require a specific zone of slow conduction so that the circuit length ( wavelength , a product of refractory period and conduction velocity [ 5 ]) can fit the anatomical pathway ?
lately , different groups have mapped the ra circuit of human afl in great detail using multiple endocardial recordings [ 6,7 ] , intra - cardiac echocardiography [ 8 ] , electro - anatomical carto [ 9 ] , 64 - electrode basket catheter [ 10 ] , non - contact ensite [ 11 ] and body surface mapping [ 12 ] .
there is a general agreement between these studies and other protocols [ 13,14 ] , measuring conduction velocity directly , regarding slow isthmus conduction during afl .
this finding has been substantiated using unipolar electrograms [ 15 ] .
the criss - cross muscular trabecular pattern in the isthmus seems to favor non - uniform anisotropic conduction [ 16 ] .
kinder et al. , then seem to be the only group disputing the presence of slow conduction in this region [ 17 ] .
recently , using the carto system , we re - constructed a bi - atrial map of isthmus - dependent afl [ 18 ] .
the right and the left side of the atrial septum was mapped separately .
the initiation of left atrial ( la ) activation from the ra flutter circuit by a discrete septal breakthrough , sometimes more than one , supported that the inter - atrial conduction is via specific , functionally active trans - septal pathway ( s ) , corresponding to the sites previously identified : inferior coronary sinus - la connection , bachmann 's bundle and the fossa ovalis [ 19 ] .
interestingly , the sequence of activation on the right and the left side of the septum was not always synchronous .
for example , we observed in a patient with clockwise ( cw ) - afl that the right septum was activated in a supero - inferior direction but the spread of activation in the left septum , following a breakthrough in the region of fossa ovalis , was supero - inferiorly as well as infero - superiorly .
does this argue for an electrically separate behaviour of the right and the left atrial septum ? is the upper turn around site of the ra flutter circuit , anterior or posterior to the superior vena cava ( svc ) ?
detailed mapping has shown that activation often proceeded on both sides of the svc [ 9,18 ] .
which limb of activation is then a part of the macro - reentrant circuit ?
entrainment studies suggest activation anterior to the svc orifice , between the svc and tricuspid annulus , as the upper turn around site of the flutter circuit [ 6,20 ] .
this " superior isthmus " is , however , too wide to be a routine target for flutter ablation .
until recently it was unanimously believed that the crista terminalis formed the posterior boundary of the afl circuit .
the study of friedman et al. , brought new information , suggesting that the postero - medial ra ( sinus venosa region ) provided the posterior functional line of block [ 7 ] .
this was based on their observation that , during counterclockwise ( ccw ) and cw - afl , the posterior ra wall activation was consistent from patient to patient , along the direction of activation of anterior ra wall , but opposite to the direction of septal activation .
furthermore , they reported double potentials in the postero - medial ra region , suggesting a turn around point .
although their reasoning is convincing , we [ 18 ] as well as shah et al. , [ 9 ] have found heterogeneity in the activation of posterior ra wall. is crista terminalis , in patients with afl , always impermeable ?
clinical significance the crista terminalis is a thick muscular ridge beginning at the superior septal surface , running anterior to the svc orifice , down the anterior ra wall , and then proceeding between the tricuspid annulus and the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) .
it ends as eustachian valve .
poor transverse conduction across the crista is important to hold the flutter pathway against the tricuspid annulus , in other words , to maintain the posterior boundary of the flutter circuit [ 21,22 ] .
some findings discussed below suggest that transverse coupling may occur at various sites along the crista .
recently , the group of scheinman described atypical forms of ra - afl [ 23 ] .
these are generally faster than the associated typical afl and often transient .
lower - loop re - entry is an isthmus - dependent afl characterized by re - entry around the ivc , following a breakthrough low or high in the crista terminalis .
also , multiple cristal breakthroughs were observed during acceleration of some episodes of typical afl .
a break down of the posterior functional crista barrier has been suggested as one of the mechanism of transition from afl to atrial fibrillation ( af ) [ 22,24 ] .
while judging the success of afl ablation , both bi - directional isthmus conduction ( bic ) block and a complete isthmus - line of double potentials are complementary to each other [ 25 ] .
the routine demonstration of bic and block are based on the assumption of lack of transverse conduction across crista terminalis .
occasionally , during coronary sinus ( cs ) pacing after isthmus ablation , despite the presence of complete isthmus line of double potentials , the activation pattern recorded by the halo catheter does not show an isthmus conduction block .
this could be confusing and may lead to unnecessary additional radiofrequency pulses .
a study by scaglione et al. , explained that the apparent conduction over the isthmus during pacing from proximal cs was due to conduction along the posterior part of the ivc orifice , which then activated the low anterior ra via a cristal breakthrough [ 26 ] .
do we understand completely the electrocardiographic inscription of ccw - and cw - afl ?
lai et al. , dismissed the role of flutter wave polarity to distinguish between ccw and cw rotation of afl [ 27 ] .
neither was the 3 - dimensional carto mapping of the ra helpful [ 9 ] .
bystander atrial regions , posterior ra and la , might be important contributors to the ecg flutter wave morphology .
okumura et al .
[ 28 ] , and schoels et al .
[ 29 ] , using animal models of afl , have since long suggested a role of la activation .
an infero - superior septal activation , after the exit of the flutter wave from the ra isthmus , and a supero - inferior anterior ra wall activation , following thereafter , is the principal generator of the basic - initial negative followed by terminal positive - inferior ecg - lead deflection of ccw - afl [ 10,18 ] .
frequently , variations are observed in the extent of initial negative polarity and the terminal positive part of the flutter wave [ 30 ] .
in our study , patients with ccw - afl showed consistent infero - superior la activation , starting soon after isthmus activation , and therefore synchronous with septal activation .
the total la activation time was always shorter , and as a proportion of afl cycle length varied from patient to patient .
consequently , the overlap of la activation with the oppositely directed supero - inferior anterior ra wall activation showed inter - individual variations .
summarily , the la activation definitely influences the initial negative part of the flutter wave , but the extent to which it modifies the terminal positive deflection varies from patient to patient .
cw - afl is generally recognized to have a small initial negative followed by a prominent and notched positive flutter wave in the inferior leads .
this morphology correlates well with an initial infero - superior anterior ra wall activation followed by a supero - inferior septal activation .
the positive part of the flutter wave after the notch is believed to result from a supero - inferior la activation via the bachmann 's bundle .
controversially , saoudi et al. , reported the classical inferior - lead pattern - prominent negative followed by small terminal positive flutter waves - in a majority of their patients with cw - afl [ 31 ] .
our study could not corroborate that la activation during cw - afl was always via bachmann 's bundle and therefore responsible for the positive part of the flutter wave after the notch [ 18 ] .
because of the infrequency of cw - afl , < 10 % of ccw - afl population , only a small number of patients have been studied by each of the previous authors .
variations reported in the ecg and the bi - atrial activation pattern of cw - afl make it difficult to arrive at a consensus .
isthmus - dependent afl associated with other heart disease .
have we acknowledged enough ?
lately there has been a focus on macro - reentrant atrial tachycardias after cardiac surgery .
some reports suggest that 40 % - 70 % of intra - atrial re - entrant circuits after mustard , senning or fontan operation , or after complete repair of atrial septal defect , tetralogy of fallot , or a rastelli procedure are isthmus - dependent [ 32,33 ] .
in the remaining cases , the re - entrant circuits were associated with lateral right atriotomy scar or atrial septal patch .
akar et al. , found that multiple circuits , including isthmus - dependent afl , could coexist and surface ecg morphology does not provide adequate discrimination [ 34 ] .
isthmus - dependent afl has been seen after mitral valve replacement [ 32 ]. and in the donor atrium after orthotopic heart transplant [ 35 ] .
hypertrophic [ 36 ]. and tachycardia - induced [ 37 ] .
cardiomyopathy are also associated with isthmus - dependent afl .
carto mapping is certainly useful in post - surgery atrial arrhythmias .
it helps to distinguish a focal from a re - entrant mechanism .
moreover , the unidentified circuit path can be spatially reconstructed .
we studied 15 patients with afl after repair of atrial septal defect or ebstein 's anomaly and replacement / repair of mitral or aortic valve .
electrocardiographically , afl was typical , with negative ( n = 11 ) or positive ( n = 2 ) inferior - lead flutter waves in a majority of patients , and atypical in 2 .
during electrophysiological study afl was documented in 13 patients , and ccw rotation ( n = 11 ) was frequently induced .
isthmus ablation was successful in 13 ( 87 %) patients .
in the present - days it is important to recognize afl in the setting of an implanted pacing or a shocking device .
physiological pacing does not prevent recurrence of afl , therefore ablation should be considered when afl is detected [ 38 ] .
in patients with an implantable atrial defibrillator [ 39 ] .
better algorithms are required to distinguish afl from af , because some devices ( 7250 jewel ( r ) af arrhythmia management device , medtronic , inc ) can over - pace afl .
ablation could be considered to reduce the number of device shocks .
even with a dual - chamber icd , afl with fast ventricular rate could lead to inappropriate shocks [ 40 ] .
a recent study showed that , none of the patients after isthmus ablation had inappropriate icd therapies for afl [ 41 ] .
" organized af " .
could it be sometimes isthmus - dependent ?
about 10 - 30 % of patients with afl have associated af [ 38,42 ] .
further , compared to patients without treatment or those treated with rate - control therapy , use of aads for prophylaxis of af is associated with a three - fold increased probability of afl recurrence [ 43 ] .
current literature supports that isthmus ablation for afl could reduce recurrences of associated af [ 4,44 ] .
since the first publication by huang et al. , there has been more evidence that rfa of " aad - induced afl " could palliate recurrent af [ 4,45,46 ] .
we need to discuss an electrophysiological entity encountered often in the laboratory : ecg shows coarse af. a halo catheter , positioned around the tricuspid annulus , shows a repetitive ccw activation pattern with beat - to - beat variations in the cycle length ( 170 - 210 ms ) .
electrograms obtained from the coronary sinus may show 1:1 ra : la response or disorganized atrial activity .
what are we dealing with ? is it " organized af " ?
according to one study , the cycle length variability of afl should not exceed 11.5 ms and the index of irregularity ( ratio of mean cycle length and standard deviation of mean cycle length ) should be < 7.5 % [ 47 ] .
our experience after isthmus ablation in 3 patients with similar electrophysiological features was dismal [ 4 ] .
coarse af did not stop and all patients continued to have recurrences .
however kumagai et al. , after isthmus ablation in a similar group of patients ( n = 16 ) were successful in preventing af in 75 % patients at 1 - year follow - up [ 48 ] .
higher f wave amplitude in lead v1 , left ventricular ejection fraction and left atrial dimension were significant predictors of success .
the favorable results of kumagai et al. , raises mechanistic issues. is it likely that , in some patients this particular type of af is associated with a large " mother wave " in the ra and small dependent " daughter waves " in la ?
[ 49 ] .
a repetitive ccw activation pattern along the halo catheter suggests a constant trajectory along the anterior ra wall and through the isthmus .
beat - to - beat variations in the remaining re - entrant trajectory , probably ra septum and roof , may then be responsible for the observed cycle length variations of this arrhythmia , which is otherwise " organized " .
conduction to la may be 1:1 or fibrillatory .
a high - density mapping system , such as the non - contact ensite , could be used to obtain a beat - to - beat map of this arrhythmia , to determine how often the re - entrant pathway traverses the isthmus .
could this exercise predict patients who will benefit from isthmus ablation ?
interruption of the leading ra " mother wave " may render the remaining la wavelets unsustainable .
this proposal is based on the current understanding of the re - entrant nature of afl and af , but is hypothetical and certainly open to investigation .

community compensatory trend ( cct ) is thought to facilitate persistence of rare species and thus stabilize species composition in tropical forests .
however , whether cct acts over broad geographical ranges is still in question .
in this study , we tested for the presence of negative density dependence ( ndd ) and cct in three forests along a tropical - temperate gradient .
inventory data were collected from forest communities located in three different latitudinal zones in china .
two widely used methods were used to test for ndd at the community level .
the first method considered relationships between the relative abundance ratio and adult abundance .
the second method emphasized the effect of adult abundance on abundance of established younger trees .
evidence for ndd acting on different growth forms was tested by using the first method , and the presence of cct was tested by checking whether adult abundance of rare species affected that of established younger trees less than did abundance of common species .
both analyses indicated that ndd existed in seedling , sapling and pole stages in all three plant communities and that this effect increased with latitude .
however , the extent of ndd varied among understory , midstory and canopy trees in the three communities along the gradient .
additionally , despite evidence of ndd for almost all common species , only a portion of rare species showed ndd , supporting the action of cct in all three communities .
so , we conclude that ndd and cct prevail in the three recruitment stages of the tree communities studied ; rare species achieve relative advantage through cct and thus persist in these communities ; cct clearly facilitates newly established species and maintains tree diversity within communities across our latitudinal gradient .
introduction persistence of rare species in a community is intriguing .
compared with common species , rare species usually show low levels of self - compatibility , low overall reproductive effort and poor dispersal ability [ 1 ] .
however , rare species still occur in nature and contribute a large proportion of the total number of species in most forests [ 2 ] - [ 6 ] ( e.g. there are 300 rare species , accounting for 36 % of all species of the pasoh forest [ 6 ]) .
thus , mechanisms that compensate for the disadvantages faced by rare species in competition with more common species could facilitate their persistence .
some studies have postulated that compensatory mechanisms might be driven by density - dependent death rates [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
these mechanisms could be general and have been termed ' community compensatory trend ( cct )' [ 4 ] , [ 10 ] - [ 11 ] .
most researchers consider cct as a process that confers advantage to rare species as a result of increased density dependent mortality with increasing abundance .
therefore , at the community level , a negative relationship between species population growth rates and abundance of the populations would indicate the existence of cct .
in the past thirty years , there have been many attempts to document the action of cct operating on the community level , but the results have been inconsistent .
some studies have shown the existence of cct [ 4 ] - [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] - [ 14 ] , while other do not find evidence of the process [ 6 ] , [ 15 ] - [ 17 ] ( figure 1 ) .
studies that support cct found the per - adult recruitment rate declined with the increase of adult abundance [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] .
in contrast , the studies that did not support cct found significant positive relationships between seedling ( or sapling ) survival and the number of adults [ 6 ] , [ 15 ] - [ 17 ] .
in addition , a recent study [ 17 ] found that the effect of conspecific neighbors on survival was significantly and positively related to species abundance , with low - abundance species experiencing stronger ndd .
these results question the occurrence of a cct as a general mechanism promoting species coexistence .

the contrasting findings may result from use of different criteria for assessing populations growth rates .
even in the same forest , variation in criteria can lead to different conclusions .
for example in bci forest , charles et al .
[ 12 ] used per - adult recruitment rate to assess populations growth rates and their finding supported cct ; but comita et al. used seedling survival for the assessment and their findings did not support cct [ 15 ] , [ 17 ] .
this result may simply reflect that most low - abundance species possess higher per - adult recruitment rate and lower survival rate than do common species [ 5 ] , [ 12 ] .
however , survival is only one factor affecting species recruitment [ 5 ] , [ 12 ] .
it is worth noting that low survival rates of rare species can be offset by higher seed production or seedling survival [ 18 ] and be expressed as high recruitment per adult .
thus , at the community level , we argue that per - adult recruitment rate should be a better measure of population growth .
in addition , varied life stages and growth forms may also affect the assessment of cct .
for example , by considering growth forms , connell et al .
[ 10 ] found evidence for cct only among understory trees .
thus , aspects such as the tree 's growth form and life stage should be considered while evaluating cct .
beyond the controversy about the general action of cct , little is known whether cct prevails across wide geographical ranges .
most studies addressing cct have been conducted in the tropical forest [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] - [ 13 ] , with few conducted in subtropical and temperate forests [ 14 ] , [ 19 ] - [ 20 ] .
combining previous results , lambers et al .
[ 20 ] analyzed the relationship between the proportion of tree taxa experiencing density - dependent mortality and latitude .
their results indicated that density - dependent mortality did not increase over tropical latitudes , thus contradicting the idea that density - dependent mortality is responsible for the latitudinal gradient in species diversity .
however , as an indirect assessment , this study may be insufficient to detail the relationship between ndd and latitude .
for example , lambers et al. did not consider that previous studies used two different criteria , based on , respectively , on tree life stage and growth , possibly leading to different inferences .
therefore , further studies are required to elucidate the relation between ndd and latitude .
in this study , we investigated the presence of cct in tree communities at different latitudes and the relationship between ndd ( or cct ) and latitude .
we systematically established sample plots at three latitudes encompassing tropical , subtropical and temperate zones and analyzed the data with identical methods .
we sought to detect ndd in all three communities and to compare ndd between rare and common species .
two widely used methods were applied to detect density dependence in these communities and distinguish the action of ndd between rare and common species .

field methodology during 2007 - 2008 , three 1 - ha permanent plots ( 100 mx100 m ) were established at each of the three study sites described above .
each plot was divided into 100 subplots ( 10 mx10 m ) .
four seedling plots ( 1 mx1 m ) were placed around the center of every other subplot .
in total , 600 seedling plots were located in 3 - ha of permanent plots at each site ( figure s1 ) .
all of the seedlings ( 0.1 cm <= height < 1.5 m , or diameter at breast height < 1 cm ) within the seedling plots were identified to species and enumerated .
in the permanent plots , all of the individuals of height >= 1.5 m were tagged , identified and enumerated , and their diameter at breast height ( dbh ; 1.3 m above the ground ) measured .
the tree species were assigned to a growth form based on architecture and maximum height attained : understory trees ( 4 - 10 m tall ) , midstory trees ( 10 - 20 m tall ) , and canopy trees (>= 20 m tall ) [ 10 ] , [ 25 ] .
in each growth form the trees with height >= 1.5 m and dbh >= 1 cm were categorized to three stages : sapling ( 1 cm < dbh <= 2.5 cm ) ; pole ( 2.5 cm < dbh <= 5 cm for understory trees , 2.5 cm < dbh <= 7.5 cm for midstory trees and 2.5 cm < dbh <= 10 cm for canopy trees ) ; and adult ( dbh >= 5 cm for understory trees , dbh >= 7.5 cm for midstory trees and dbh >= 10 cm for canopy trees ) .
analysis density dependent effect test two widely used methods were employed to test density dependent effects at the community level as follows .
the first one was used by webb & peart [ 4 ] .
for all species , relative abundances were calculated as the ratio of species density in each size class to density of the same species in larger size classes .
under the assumption that species' relative abundance does not change rapidly in time , a pattern of lower ratios in common species than in rare species is consistent with density - dependent mortality .
thus , this ratio was compared between common and rare species .
if the relative abundance ratio in more abundant species is lower than in rare species density - dependent effects are strongly suggested ( we used adult basal area as a proxy of abundance , following webb & peart , 1999 , because basal area is a better indicator of tree biomass , canopy area and reproductive output than that of density alone [ 4 ]) .
the second method has been used previously to detect density dependence for the transition from seed to seedling life stages [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , to test whether abundance of reproductive adults negatively affects per capita number of seedlings [ 5 ] , and to demonstrate rare species advantage in sapling recruitment [ 12 ] .
we modeled relationships between seedling , sapling or pole abundance and adult abundance in three forest communities as : ( 1 ) this power function can be easily evaluated using least squares regression by , first , log transforming both sides of the equation : ( 2 ) where s is the number of established seedlings , sapling or poles , r is the number of adults , a is the mean density - independent seedling , sapling or poles establishment per adult , and b captures the effect of species abundance on established seedling , sapling or poles abundance .
b = 1 indicates adults do not have density - dependent effect on the abundance of the focal stage ( i.e. , seedlings , sapling or poles ) ; b < 1 indicates a negative effect ; b > 1 indicates a positive effect .
variation in density - dependence between different growth forms because we found the first method have better fitness than the second method under fewer data conditions , we analyzed variation in density - dependence between different growth forms exclusively using the first method .
cct test the existence of community - level density dependence alone might not provide any advantage to rare species .
when a community experiences community - level density dependence , there are three possibilities : ( 1 ) all rare species show stronger density dependence than common species ; thus , there is no rare species advantage ; ( 2 ) all rare species show less conspecific density dependence than common species , and thus , a rare species advantage is said to occur ; ( 3 ) the degree of density dependence relative to common species varies with rare species , and thus , overall rare species advantage will be determined by the proportion of rare species that show advantage .
using the log transformed power function , we estimated b for each species , thereby capturing the effect of species abundance on the abundance of seedlings , saplings or poles .
we then modeled the relationship between b and log transformed adult abundance ( adult basal area was also used as a proxy of abundance as before ) .
if the proportion of b > 1 for the less abundant tree species is larger than for most abundant species , we conclude that cct exists .
results individuals enumerated and data used at the tropical site , we counted 1,930 seedlings belonging to 115 species in the 600 seedling plots and 15,099 trees ( dbh >= 1 cm ) belonging to 210 species in the 3 - ha plot .
at our subtropical site , there were 1,845 seedlings belonging to 82 species and 13,956 trees ( dbh >= 1 cm ) belonging to 166 species .
for our temperate site , we counted 2,698 seedlings belonging to 18 species and 5,968 trees ( dbh >= 1 cm ) belonging to 44 species .

density dependence test the log relative abundance ratio was negatively correlated with log adult abundance across all three life stages ( seedling , sapling and poles ) in all three of the forest communities ( figure 2 ) .
for each life stage , the regression slope of the relative abundance ratio to adult abundance decreased with latitude ( table 1 ) .
thus , according to these results from our first method , ndd exists in all three forest communities and the strength of ndd increases with latitude .
interestingly , the regression slope increased with tree size among the tree life stages in the subtropical forest community , but decreased a little for saplings in both tropical and temperate forest communities ( figure 2 ; table 1 ) .
these results indicate that the effect of ndd varies among different life stages .

data have been log transformed .
species adult abundance was measured as adult basal area .
the slope of the regression line significantly less than zero indicates relative abundance ratio declining with increasing adult abundance .

the result of the power function analysis showed that the values of coefficient b , which captures the effect of species abundance on the establishment of seedlings , saplings or poles , are generally less than one in all three communities ( figure 3 ; table 2 ) .
therefore adult abundance had a negative effect on conspecific seedling , sapling and pole abundance across the latitudinal gradient .
however , b decreased with latitude , indicating that the negative effect of adult abundance on seedling , sapling and pole abundance increased with latitude .
the coefficient ( b ) increased with tree size in tropical and subtropical forest , but decreased for saplings in the temperate forest ( figure 3 ; table 2 ) .
thus , the degree of density dependence varied among life stages .

different growth forms showed different patterns .
the relative abundance of adult canopy tree species had significant negative relationships with saplings and poles in the tropical forest community , but only for saplings in the subtropical forest community .
in contrast , the relative abundance of midstory tree species showed significant negative relationships between adult abundance and seedlings and saplings at the tropical site , but we found negative relationships for all life stages at the subtropical site .
for understory trees , the negative relationship was significant for seedlings in tropical plots , but only for poles at the subtropical site ( table 1 ) .
this indicates that density dependent effects varied among growth forms and life stage .
cct test the relationship between power function coefficient b and adult abundance of species ( figure 4 ) showed that the coefficient for the more abundant trees was generally less than one .
however , b values for less common species can fell into two groups , being either more or less than one .
this pattern existed in all three latitudinal forest communities and did not obviously change with latitude ( figure 4 ) .
thus , the fact that most common species exhibited ndd gave rare species a relative advantage and this pattern consistent with the cct hypothesis prevailed from tropical to temperate forests existed .
discussion wide - spread of community - level density dependence we have demonstrated that community - level density dependence is wide - spread in three forests along a latitudinal gradient in china .
the relative abundance ratio had a negative relationship with adult abundance and the values of power function coefficient ( b ) were less than one for all three life stages ( seedlings , saplings and poles ) in all three communities .
therefore , our study not only confirms that ndd occurs in tropical [ 4 ] - [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] - [ 13 ] and subtropical forests [ 14 ] , but also shows that ndd occurs in temperate forests .
clearly , this mechanism for generating rare species advantage is wide - spread across latitude .
additionally , we found that the increase in density dependent with latitudes ( i.e. , the regression slope of relative abundance ratio to adult abundance , and the coefficient b decreases with latitude ) .
as latitude increased , number of trees per unit area of forest decreased ( for tree dbh >= 1 cm , in the tropical forest community was 15,099 individuals / 3ha , in the subtropical forest community was 13,956 individuals / 3ha , and in the temperate forest community was 5,968 individuals / 3ha ) .
in contrast , however , species - specific density for adult trees increased with latitude , i.e. , for adult trees densities were 0.0007 , 0.0009 , and 0.0020 / m2 , respectively , in the tropical , the subtropical and the temperate communities ; for seedlings , the corresponding figures were 0.028 , 0.038 and 0.250 , respectively .
thus , the density ratios of seedlings to adults were 40.0 , 42.2 and 125.0 at the tropical , the subtropical and the temperate site , respectively .
these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the probability that survivorship of a given species is negatively influenced by natural enemies or intraspecific competition increases with latitude , and that the shift is most notable between subtropical and temperate forest communities .
previous researches have shown that natural enemies and intraspecific competition both contribute to the ndd [ 7 ] - [ 8 ] ; in addition , recent studies show that negative effects of pathogens can play a key role in ndd and that the impact of pathogens increase with increases in conspecific density [ 28 ] .
such relationships could contribute to the increase in ndd with latitude .
ndd varied among different growth forms and life stages our results showed that the extent of ndd varied among both growth form and life stage in three forests ( table 1 ) .
although canopy trees did not show ndd for seedlings in the tropical forest , they did show ndd at both sapling and pole stages , ndd was evident only at the sapling stage in the subtropical forest .
further , understory trees showed ndd at the seedling stage in tropical forest , in contrast , at the pole stage in subtropical forest .
these results partly confirm connell 's hypothesis [ 10 ] that only understory trees show significant density dependence at the seedling stage in tropical forest .
this might be reflect differences in life history strategy among tree growth forms in forests of different latitudes .
in tropical forest , for example , canopy tree seedlings may demand less light while saplings and poles require more light [ 29 ] .
thus , the death rate of poles might raise for they could only reach to the midstory and their stronger light demands hardly be satisfied .
in contrast , the poles of most subtropical canopy species might more easily reach to the top layer because most trees were already midstory species in this forest ( table 1 ) .
each tree growth form has specific light and other resource demands at specific life stages , and if these demands are unsatisfied , the tree may die .
since meeting these demands is affected by forest structure , something that changes with latitude and forest type , the same growth forms and tree species may show different degrees of ndd depending on forest and different latitude .
nonetheless , our research demonstrates the existence of ndd over a range of forest including typical tropical monsoon montane rain forest , subtropical and temperate broad - leaved forest .
more studies are required , however , to determine the global extent of such effects in shaping forest vegetation .
rare species advantage our result show asymmetric density dependence : ndd operated for almost all common species , but data for only a portion of rare species gave evidence for such effects ( figure 4 ). this pattern can perhaps be explained in relation of the effects of microorganisms as follows .
when a new species invades a community , it may accumulate microorganisms in the rhizosphere .
for example , some rare tree species may accumulate more beneficial bacteria than pathogens [ 30 ] , and their recruitment may be thus facilitated by and give rise to positive density dependence with respect to adult trees .
other rare species , however , may accumulate more pathogens than beneficial bacteria , and as a consequence , reflect a pattern of ndd .
in contrast , most common species have been long present in their forest , providing ample opportunity for infection by soil pathogens [ 31 ] - [ 32 ] .
thus , they may more generally show higher density dependent mortality as adult abundance increases .
we considered this asymmetric density dependence operating across a community as cct that contributes to a general rare species advantage .
thus , our argument differs from previous that either hold the existence of community - level ndd as cct positive [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] , or suggest that ndd is more common in rare than common species [ 17 ] .
we argue that the existence of ndd can lead to three possible results .
when all rare species show less ndd or the proportion of rare species showing ndd is less than for common species , community - level cct may be entertained as a possible explanation for persistence of rare species .
this situation was reflected in our results from 3 forest types , spanning a wide latitudinal gradient , and suggests that the hypothesis of cct being driven by ndd has broad merit .
ndd , cct , diversity maintenance and the latitudinal gradient we hold that ndd can promote maintenance of species diversity , and that this mechanism is wide - spread in forest communities .
our data corroborates previous researches [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] in suggesting that ndd can promote rare species advantage .
in addition , we argue that cct can also contribute to maintenance of forest tree diversity by contributing to rare species advantage .
we doubt that ndd and cct contribute significantly to latitudinal gradient in tree diversity as previously proposed [ 33 ] - [ 34 ] .
this is partially consistent with lambers et.al [ 20 ] whose research showed that density - dependent mortality did not decrease with latitudes in tropics , and concluded that density - dependent mortality is not responsible for the latitudinal gradient in species diversity .
however , our doubt raise from another reason : ndd increased rather dramatically from low to high latitude , and especially between our subtropical and temperate site ; and cct which is partly driven by ndd , did not show significant latitudinal differences .
conclusions our findings showed that cct operates over a broad latitudinal range and that the advantage that a portion of rare species gain from cct may allow them to persist in forest communities .
this process clearly facilitates growth and propagation of newly established species and thus can contribute to maintaining species diversity in forest tree communities .

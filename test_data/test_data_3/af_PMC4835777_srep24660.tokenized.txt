however , since graphite can be hypothetically derived from diamond by stretching it along its [ 111 ] axis , many 3d materials can also potentially be explored as new candidates for 2d materials .
using a density functional theory , we perform a systematic study over the common group iv , iii - v , and ii - vi semiconductors along different deformation paths to reveal new structures that are topologically connected to but distinctly different from the 3d parent structure .
specifically , we explore two major phase transition paths , originating respectively from wurtzite and nias structure , by applying compressive and tensile strain along the symmetry axis , and calculating the total energy changes to search for potential metastable states , as well as phonon spectra to examine the structural stability .
each path is found to further split into two branches under tensile strain - low buckled and high buckled structures , which respectively lead to a low and high buckled monolayer structure .
most promising new layered or planar structures identified include beo , gan , and zno on the tensile strain side , ge , si , and gap on the compressive strain side .
2d materials are the subjects of great current interest .
searching for new 2d materials has been primarily focusing on layered materials , such as graphite , transition metal dichalcogenides , black phosphorus123 .
a large number of layered materials have been surveyed theoretically for their potentials becoming new 2d materials4 .
silicene is perhaps the only noticeable 2d material that is considered as being derived from a 3d structure5 .
although graphene is commonly viewed as a single layer of a layered material , graphite , there is in fact a topological connection between diamond and graphene : the latter can be viewed as resulting from stretching the former along its [ 111 ] axis till the buckling within each bilayer collapses and eventually the bilayers or graphene sheets decouple from each other .
this process is illustrated in fig. 1 along with various other possible related planar or layer structures. by noticing this topological connection , one can envision an alternative avenue for discovering new 2d materials , by exploring wide variety 3d structures of commonly encountered semiconductors .
graphene and bn like 2d materials have been investigated theoretically as monolayers of group iv6 , iii - v7 , and ii - vi ( zno ) 8 .
the structural evolution from 3d to layered structures have been studied for c910 , bn11 , beo12 , and si13 .
a related 3d structure nias has also been explored for a few binaries : gan14 , zno15 , and znte16 , although the subtle connections among these seemingly very different 3d structures and their topologic connections with different layered structures are not immediately clear .
in this work , by examining systematically all the group iv , iii - v , and ii - vi elemental and binary semiconductors , we offer ( 1 ) a comprehensive picture on the topologic connections along different phase transition paths , between a core structure , wurtzite ( wz ) , and various derivatives : low - buckled and high - buckled layered structures , their asymptotic 2d structures , and nias structures ; ( 2 ) insight to their structural stability and the its dependence on the atomic properties of the elements ; ( 3 ) predictions for a number of new structures that are potentially achievable experimentally .
this work provides guidance to discovering novel 2d materials complementary to those derived from the layered structures , and fundamental insight to the structure - property relationship .
our basic approach is taking wz structure as a starting point then searching for other energetically favorable stable or metastable states by stretching and compressing along the c axis of wz structure , and in addition , allowing one of the bilayers to slip or rotate laterally .
a density - functional theory is used for total energy minimization with varying structural parameters .
phonon spectra are calculated to examine the structural stability17 .
a structure with no imaginary phonon mode is deemed ( meta ) stable against small local distortions .
an evolution tree starting from the wz structure for a compound xy , with x representing cations and y anions , is depicted in fig. 1 , illustrating various derivative structures along different deformation paths .
the wz structure is illustrated in fig. 1 ( a ) , where a and c are the lattice parameters in x - y plane and z direction , respectively , and uc is the bond length for the bond along the c axis with u =~ 3 / 8 .
the unit cell contains two monolayers separated by c / 2 , and each monolayer consists of two closely spaced atomic layers , together known as a bilayer or a buckled single atomic layer .
the height of the bilayer or the buckling parameter deltawz = ( 1 / 2 - u ) c =~ c / 8 =~ dwz / 3 , where dwz is the bond length .
the change in the relative alignment of the two monolayers within one period may result in more variations in structure .
there are five distinctly different arrangements : 18192021 ( 1 ) aa stacking ( same type atoms in the two monolayers are aligned ) ; ( 2 ) stacking ( the opposite type atoms in the two monolayers are aligned , as in wz zno and common h - bn ) ; ( 3 ) axb ( cation x atoms are aligned , y atoms are staggered , as in nias phase of gaas ) ; ( 4 ) ayb stacking ( anion y atoms are aligned , x atoms are staggered , also known as anti - nias structure ) , and ( 5 ) ( an one pair of the opposite type atoms in the two monolayers are aligned , but the other pair are staggered ) .
when x and y are the same , the first two cases will reduce to aa stacked graphite , and the other three cases the common ab stacked graphite .
according to these definitions , the wz structure shown in fig. 1 ( a ) belongs to , fig. 1 ( b ) belongs to axb .
starting from wz of fig. 1 ( a ) , compressing it along the c axis gives rise to fig. 1 ( c ) - a planar structure ; stretching it leads to fig. 1 ( e ) - a low buckled ( lb ) layered structure or fig. 1 ( d ) - a high buckled ( hb ) layered structure ; rotating or translating one of the monolayers in wz arrives at fig. 1 ( b ) - nias structure , and further stretching nias structure generates a planar or a lb structure fig. 1 ( f ) or a hb structure fig. 1 ( g ) .
if taking the structure of fig. 1 ( e ) or fig. 1 ( f ) to a sufficiently large layer separation , one will have a 2d structure that may be either totally flat or slightly buckled , depending on the atomic size .
it is implicitly assumed that during structural deformation the atoms are allowed to fully relax to minimize the total energy , but the symmetry about the c axis is kept unchanged .
among all the possible group iv , iii - v , and ii - vi semiconductors , nine most representative members , including c , si , ge , bn , gan , gap , beo , zno , and znte , are highlighted in this work .
results and discussion total energy comparison between wurtzite and planar structure among all the group iv , iii - v , and ii - vi semiconductors , only two of them ( c and bn ) are known to also have a layered structure consisting of hexagonal planar ( hp ) layers .
the layered structure can be obtained hypothetically , if not always practically feasible , by stretching wz structure along the c axis , until the buckled bilayers collapse into hp layers ( with the nearest neighbor atoms on the same plane ) , namely aa stacked graphite or h - bn in stacking .
in a total energy calculation , this phase transition process is manifested as the appearance of a secondary total energy minimum at c0hp > c0wz 9101122 , where c0wz and c0hp are respectively the c axis lattice constant for the two phases .
such a secondary minimum was not found for other semiconductors that were explored in the past , including si , gaas22 , and beo12 .
however , we have found that except for c , bn , and beo , the total energy etot,p ( c ) curve actually exhibits a secondary minimum with c0hp < c0wz , as shown in fig. 2 , for the rest compounds .
the optimized in - plane ( a ) and out - of plane ( c ) lattice parameters for both the wz and hp structure are listed in table 1 .
each panel of fig. 2 includes three curves , respectively calculated for an ideal wz structure ( i.e. , with a fixed u value ) , an ideal hp structure , and the distorted wz structurewith no constrain on u. clearly the third curve etot ( c ) represents the lower - bound of the combined total energy paths described by the other two curves .
all these materials fall into one of the two scenarios : ( i ) c0hp > c0wz , and ( ii ) c0hp < c0wz .
only c , bn and beo belong to scenario ( i ) , indicating that they can in principle form a graphite - like planar structure by applying tensile strain .
furthermore , there is an energy barrier between wz and hp phase in the total energy curve for c , bn and beo , which helps them to stabilize in either of the two phases .
however , beo has a small barrier of merely 6 mev / atom ( missed previously12 ) , which is less than 25 mev of room temperature thermal energy .
the phonon calculation has revealed that there are imaginary modes for the hp beo , in contrast to the case for c and bn where no imaginary mode was found .
the appearance of imaginary phonon modes indicates that the structure is unstable against distortion that lowers the symmetry .
these observations may explain why graphite and h - bn are the only readily available layered materials that are topologically connected to their 3d counterparts .
the other six semiconductors of fig. 2 belong to scenario ( ii ) , implying that a planar phase could in principle appear by applying compressive strain .
it may seem counterintuitive that for the material involving large atoms the planar phase would occur at smaller instead of larger c axis layer spacing than that of wz. in fact , this is because the fact that while some vertical coupling remains a sufficiently large lateral spacing is required to allow the buckled atoms to drop down to the lower plane of the bilayer , depending on the sizes of the atoms involved .
note that the formation of the hp structure on the basal plane does not necessarily mean that the structure has sp2 + pi bonding or can be considered as a layered material .
however , the vertical coupling is expected to be weakened , because even though the c axis lattice constant is reduced , as shown in fig. 1 ( c ) , the separation of the vertical atomic planes has been increased to c0hp that is greater than the largest vertical plane separation uc =~ 3 / 8 c0wz in the wz structure .
the fact that these planar structures do not produce a secondary minimum on the total energy path etot ( c ) , although it nearly happens for si , ge , and zno , suggests that the hp phase cannot be a metastable phase of the system in free standing , which is further confirmed by the phonon calculations that yield imaginary modes for these planar structures .
however , this finding does not preclude the possibility of forming such planar structure , if the material can be constrained by a proper substrate that can serve as a template for epitaxial growth and provide a weak bonding to the epitaxial layer ( ref .
23 for zno , ref .
24 for silicene , ref .
25 for monolayer ws2 ) .
the role of strain in stabilizing graphitic films of inn , aln , gan , beo , zno , and sic has also been studied with first principle calculations26 .
stretching and compressing wurtzite structure to get more insight about the mechanical and structural properties moving along the total energy curve shown in fig. 2 , the strain - dependent stress x ( epsilonzz ) and buckling height delta ( epsilonzz ) are calculated and plotted in fig. 3 for the 9 materials .
taking the wz structure as a reference , the strain is defined as epsilonzz = ( c - c0wz )/ c0wz , and the stress value is obtained directly from the output of the vasp calculation .
as shown in fig. 3 , qualitatively , the x ( epsilonzz ) profile is highly asymmetric with respect to epsilonzz = 0 .
on the compressive strain side ( x > 0 and epsilonzz < 0 ) , a large " stress barrier " exists between wz and hp phase ; and after passing the barrier xb , the buckling delta reduces quickly to zero for all the materials , for the reason already given above .
on the tensile strain side ( epsilonzz > 0 ) , the magnitude of the negative " stress barrier " is usually somewhat smaller than the compressive side. with increasing the c value from c0wz , the buckling increases initially then quickly reduce to zero for c , bn , gan , beo , and zno , which all involve at least one first row element , but only to a finite value for si , ge , gap , and znte .
for the latter group , as c - - > infinity , delta will approach the low - buckled monolayer value reported previously6722 .
for c , bn , and beo , after passing the negative " stress barrier " , there appears a zero stress point at finite c , corresponding to the secondary total energy minimum .
for the rest materials , x - - > 0 only as c - - > infinity , which implies that upon unloading the tensile stress , the material will go back to wz. for those materials involving the first row elements , one could think of that the buckling is maintained due to the bonding with the atoms in the adjacent bilayer .
thus , as soon as the bonding is weakened to certain extent with increasing the bilayer spacing , the bilayer will collapse spontaneously , because there is adequate lateral space in the lower sub - layer of the bilayer for the atoms in the upper sub - layer to drop down .
for those materials involving larger atoms , even the bonding with the other bilayer is fully removed with increasing the bilayer spacing , because the atoms in either the lower or upper sublayer are too big for the atoms of the two sublayers to join each other in the same plane .
thus , compression along the c axis is required to expand the lateral size of the unit cell to make room for the atoms of the upper sub - layer to drop down , while weakening the vertical coupling .
interestingly , such compressed but non - buckled structure actually has a larger interlayer spacing along the c axis .
however , the overall atomic density of hp phase is higher than that of wz. note that c , bn , and beo may also reach such a planar structure under compressive strain , but it does not yield a total energy minimum ( see fig. 2 ) .
quantitatively , for epsilonzz < 0 ( compressive strain ) , for most materials , the " stress barrier " xb is probably too large to be practically achievable to induce a phase transition by compressing the material before shattering it , for instance , xb =~ 617 gpa and epsilonzz = - 25.1 % for c. however , for zno , the barrier height is xb =~ 7.4 gpa ( epsilonzz =~ - 7.0 %) , and the hp phase appears at epsilonzz = - 18.9 % and xhp =~ 7.1 gpa , which could be practically feasible , keeping in mind that the currently achievable maximum uniaxial stress is about 1 gpa .
although with substantially larger " stress barrier " , the si and ge hp phase occur at epsilonzz = - 18.9 % ( xhp ~ 28.7 gpa ) and - 16.8 % ( xhp ~ 21.9 gpa ) , respectively .
the value of xb and the corresponding strain decreases with increasing atom size , for instance , from c to si and ge , which is correlated to the bond length or strength change .
the hp phase under uniaxial pressure has been explored theoretically for a number of materials with similar results : aln27 , gan2728 , beo29 , zno233031 , zn ( s , se , te ) 31 , mgo32 , cds , mgte , and 2h - sic29 .
experimentally , a - few - layer zno resembling the hp phase has been observed when deposited on ag surface23 , and graphite - like hexagonal nanosheets of aln have been epitaxially grown through plasma assisted mbe on single crystal ag ( 111 ) 27 .
additionally , it was predicted that a wz zno nanowire would undergo a phase transition to the hp phase ( called hx phase ) either being compressed or stretched33 .
for epsilonzz > 0 ( tensile strain ) , znte is found to have the smallest barrier | xb | =~ 9.3 gpa ( epsilonzz =~ 14.8 %) .
for zno , | xb | =~ 30.7 gpa ( epsilonzz =~ 16.3 %) , and delta - - > 0 at epsilonzz =~ 31.8 % (| xb | =~ 4.5 gpa ) .
this result suggests that it is unlikely practically feasible to stretch a zno nanowire to the point of delta - - > 0 .
our result also contradicts to the previous prediction about the possibility to obtain the hx phase ( with c0 < c0wz ) under tensile loading33 .
note that the magnitude of | xb | indicates how easy one could deform wz structure to reach the planar structure either on the compressive or tensile side , whereas | xhp | reflects the easiness of forming the structure by providing some external constrain , such as through epitaxial growth .
for simplicity , we have adopted the wz structure instead of zb as the starting point .
for the tensile strain side , the small difference at the starting point between wz and zb will not affect the final 2d material , although the intermediate states could be somewhat different .
for the compressive strain side , the difference might be more significant .
therefore , our results should be understood as one possible scenario , and the evolution starting from the zb structure should be studied separately .
global total energy search for metastable states thus far , we have assumed that during either compressing or stretching wz structure there is no lateral motion of atoms within each layer .
here we show relaxing this constrain will lead to various other structures .
as illustrated in fig. 1 , wz structure is the starting point from a structure with a buckled basal plane to evolve into planar basal plane by either stretching or compressing along the c axis .
all these structures belong to the category of stacking .
for the single element material c , is the same as aa , and the corresponding structure will be the aa stacked graphite that does not occur naturally but can be obtained under certain conditions ( ref. 34 and refs therein ) .
similarly , we can explore the possible phase transitions for the ab stacked structures , by taking nias structure as the starting point then either stretching or compressing along the c axis .
nias is also a buckled structure on the basal plane , as shown in fig. 1 ( b ) , which is topologically connected to wz structure .
for the single element material c , stretching a nias phase c , although non - existing either in reality or theoretically , will directly lead to the familiar ab stacked or common graphite phase .
for a given compound xy , among the three possible ab stacked structures : ( 1 ) axb , ( 2 ) ayb stacking , and ( 3 ) . tends to be more energetically favorable over axb or ayb .
for instance , for gan and bn , both and axb are shown to be stable but ayb is unstable from the phonon calculations , agreeing with previous findings for gan21 and h - bn181920 .
the total energy based phase transition path for the structure has been explored in fig. 2 , now we investigate the similar phase transition path as well as the variation in buckling parameter for the axb structure for the same 9 materials with the results shown in fig. 4. the obtained structure parameters are summarized in table 2 , with comparison to the available literature values .
they can be divided into three groups : ( i ) c and bn with only one total energy minimum , corresponding to the common graphite and one of the known h - bn phases ( delta = 0 ) .
( ii ) beo , zno , and gan with two total energy minima that correspond to the nias ( delta != 0 ) and planar phase ( delta = 0 ) , respectively .
for beo and gan , the nias phase has a higher total energy than the planar , whereas for zno , the nias phase is lower .
( iii ) si , ge , gap , and znte with only one total energy minimum , corresponding to the nias phase .
the nias phase has previously been studied for gan14 , zno15 , and znte16 , but the structural stability has not been explicitly examined .
in contrast to a previous report suggesting the existence of bn in nias phase35 , we do not find nias phase for bn. we have performed phonon calculations for the nias phase and planar phase , and found that : ( 1 ) the nias phase is stable for si , ge , gan , gap , and zno , but not for beo ; ( 2 ) the axb planar phase ( p - axb ) is stable for c and bn , as is known ; however , for gan , zno , and beo , even though there is a secondary total energy minimum point , the axb planar structure is unstable , judging by the existence of imaginary phonon modes .
( 3 ) nevertheless , beo in stacking , p - , is a stable planar phase , which has not been reported before , as shown as an inset of the beo panel in fig. 4 ; and ( 4 ) some imagine modes were found for the nias phase znte .
in short , nias phase is only stable for binaries with moderate size atoms ; p - axb is only stable for binaries with small size atoms ; neither nias nor p - axb is stable for beo , but is. we next discuss the variation of the buckling height with changing the bilayer separation starting from the nias phase .
on the tensile strain side , the dependence is very similar to that shown in fig. 3 for the phase transition curve starting from wz structure. with increasing layer separation , the buckling heights remain or tend to zero for c , bn , beo , gan , and zno , but to lower values for si , ge , gap , and znte , i.e. , the bilayer only collapses partially .
the presence of the first row elements n and o make it easier to form a planar structure .
however , on the compressive strain side , the layer - separation dependence of the buckling height is rather different with those shown in fig. 3 starting from wz structure .
excluding c and bn that do not exhibit the nias phase , all the other seven retain the nias structures under compression , i.e. , the buckling height decreases proportionally with the layer separation but always equals to 0.25c .
the different response between nias and wz structure lies in that the ab stacking has a closer packing thus more robust against the compression than the aa stacking , because in ab one atom is staggered over another , thus it is easier to form a close packed structure .
the effect of this close packed structure can be seen from the fact that the c axis lattice parameter has a larger value in wz than in nias , and it is true even for the in - plane lattice constant .
taking si as an example , the c value is 6.29 a vs. 5.636 a , and the a axis lattice constant 3.80 a vs. 3.587 a. comprehensive examination of si the possible phase transitions starting from wz and nias - like structures have been discussed respectively in the previous sections .
however , there are other possibilities beyond those that have already been included in figs 2 and 4 .
it has been shown for a monolayer structure , in addition to the planar or low buckled ( lb ) structure , there is a high buckled ( hb ) structure that sometime even has a lower total energy than the former .
here lb and hb structures , respectively , have a lower and higher buckling height compared to the wz structure .
however , the hb structure has been found to be unstable , based on the phonon calculation6 .
it is unclear how this hb structure is related to the known 3d structures , either wz or nias phase .
here we use si as an example to offer a more comprehensive examination over the possible structures that could be derived from the 3d structures .
because involving only one element , the five possible stacking orders have been reduced to two , i.e. , aa and ab , which respectively corresponds to wz and nias structure .
shown in fig. 5 are the phase transition curves under compression and expansion starting from either wz or nias phase for si. in addition , two curves for planar aa and ab structures are also included .
one significant feature is that under tensile strain , for either the wz or nias curve , the transformation curve actually splits into two branches : one corresponding to the lb structure that has been shown , respectively , in figs 2 and 4 ; the other branch , which was not shown there , corresponding to a hb structure that has not been identified before .
after the splitting point , the hb branch in fact has lower energy .
for the wz curve , the hb structure has a total energy minimum at c = 4.8 a , and the curve in fact extrapolates to the hb monolayer structure reported previously6 .
for the nias curve , the hb minimum occurs at c = 4.4 a. unfortunately , neither of these minima yields a metastable state , based on the appearance of imaginary phonon modes .
at c - - > infinity , the two lb branches merge to the same point - silicene , which is structurally stable6 , although not necessary chemically stable ( i.e. , easily reacting with other species ) .
similarly , at c - - > infinity , the two hb curves merge together , but none of them is structurally stable .
the curve for the ab stacking planar structure is found to have a minimum at c = 5.2 a , which actually corresponds to the " graphitic " si reported earlier13 .
again , this is not a metastable state from the phonon calculation , but nevertheless might be possible to achieve if constrained by a proper substrate .
the energy minimum of planar structure with ab stacking is higher than that of planar structure with aa stacking , which is similar to the case that the energy of the nias phase is higher than the wz phase .
however , there is an energy barrier between them .
we have offered a bird 's - eye view of the topological connections between the 2 - d structure , layered or planar structure , and 3 - d wurtzite or nias structure .
stretching or compressing the 3d structure along the wz or nias c axis will lead to each monolayer of the 3d structure to either fully or partially collapse into a planar or quasi - planar layer , resulting in a new intermediate structure with stacked planar or quasi - planar layers .
these intermediate structures are the candidates for developing new 2d materials , if the planar or quasi - planar layers can be individually isolated .
among the nine representative group iv , iii - v , and ii - vi 3d semiconductors that have been explicitly investigated for the described structural evolution , eight intermediate structures have been identified to be of particularly interest : ( 1 ) beo has a graphite - like ( with stacking ) metastable structure , which can exist in free - standing .
( 2 ) four graphite - like planar structures ( with cp > c3d ) which are metastable structures based on total energy consideration , although unstable against vibrational distortion , including beo in stacking derived from wz phase , beo , zno , and gan in axb stacking derived from nias phase .
however , these structures might be achievable by epitaxial growth on proper substrates either as single or multiple monolayers .
( 3 ) three planar structures of ge , si , and gap in stacking derived from wz phase , which are close to have a total energy minimum ( with cp < c3d ) .
it might be possible to grow these unstable structures epitaxially on proper substrates .
a single or few monolayer ( s ) of these graphite - like structures could be the new candidates of 2d materials for exploration .
in addition , the nias structure has been predicted to be a metastable state for si , ge , and gap .
in this study , we have investigated the feasibility how a monolayer in the [ 0001 ] direction of wz structure or [ 111 ] direction of zb structure can be modified to form a ( quasi - ) 2d layer , because of a clear topologic connection between the 3d structure and the graphene - like 2d hexagonal structure .
however , a less trivial quasi - 2d structure may also be derived from a two - monolayer ( 110 ) slab of zb or ( 110 ) slab of wz by imaging to continuously cleave the zb structure along the ( 110 ) plane or perhaps more realistically by " intercalating " the two - monolayer slabs with organic molecules3637 .
looking beyond the database of the conventional layered materials , a plenty of 3d materials could be explored as new 2d systems .
methods the total energy calculations are performed by using a pseudopotential density functional ( dft ) method implemented in vasp code38 .
the projector augmented plane - wave ( paw ) method within a local density approximation ( lda ) 39 , and k mesh of 12 x 12 x 8 are employed in the total energy calculation .
phonon calculations were performed using phonopy code17 17 by a supercell approach with the supercell size of 3 x 3 x 2 unit cells , where a set of supercells generated through a finite displacement method .
the force constants for the supercell were calculated using vasp code , and phonon frequencies were calculated from the force constants using phonopy code .
the electronic and phonon dispersion curves for a few key structures are given in supplemental materials .

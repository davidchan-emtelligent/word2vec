we report a case of an ocular burn injury from boiling water which resulted in conjunctival pigmentation , 1 week following injury .
for cosmetic purposes , 2 sessions of argon laser photoablation were performed .
one month after laser treatment , conjunctival pigmentation had been successfully removed and the patient was very satisfied with the results .
argon laser photoablation may be an effective way to remove postburn conjunctival pigmentation .
1. introduction ocular chemical and thermal injuries represent between 8 % and 18 % of ocular traumas [ 1 ] .
necrosis of the conjunctival and corneal epithelium and loss of limbal stem cells occur and may result in persistent epithelial defects with sterile corneal ulceration and conjunctivalization / vascularization of the corneal surface leading to visual compromise [ 2 , 3 ] .
thermal injuries can also cause aesthetic complications related to scarring and pigmentation [ 2 ] .
here , we report a case of postburn conjunctival pigmentation that was successfully removed with argon laser photoablation for cosmetic purposes .
2. case report a 20 - year - old man suffered from a thermal burn in the right eye and right periocular area from boiling water .
the accident resulted in superficial burns on approximately 10 % of the facial area .
the patient received no treatment before coming to the hospital , 3 h after burning himself , where he was immediately sent to the emergency department .
physical examination revealed redness over the temporal periocular skin , and the patient reported mild pain over the burn area .
ocular examination showed punctate epithelial erosion and injection in the temporal interpalpebral conjunctiva of the right eye .
the patient was given 0.5 % levofloxacin ( cravit ; santen pharmaceutical company , osaka , japan ) , 0.1 % fluorometholone acetate ( flarex ; alcon laboratories , fort worth , tx ) , and 0.1 % sodium hyaluronate ( kynex ; alcon korea , seoul , korea ) 4 times a day for 2 weeks .
the patient returned to our clinic for a follow - up examination the next day .
the skin in the right periocular area had developed a brownish pigmentation , which was subsequently removed as the eschar was peeled a few days later .
one week after the thermal burn - inducing accident , the patient complained of a newly developed brown pigmentation in the temporal conjunctiva of his right eye .
neither the patient nor the examining physician had noticed or observed the pigmentation when the thermal burn occurred .
slit - lamp examination revealed a superficial conjunctival pigmentation , with a horizontal diameter of 7.8 mm and a vertical diameter of 5.5 mm , in the right eye ( figure 1 ( a )) .
all punctate epithelial erosions in the conjunctiva had completely healed .
ten days later , conjunctival pigmentation persisted without any discernable change and the patient wished to have the cosmetically disturbing lesion removed .
after discussing all treatment options ( i.e. , surgical excision and argon laser photoablation ) with the patient , he chose to undergo argon laser therapy .
two photoablation sessions were needed because of the large size of the pigmentation .
these were performed in the right eye one week apart .
after topical anesthesia was obtained by instilling a few drops of proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5 % ( alcaine ; alcon laboratories , fortworth , tx ) , the laser was focused directly on an area of pigmentation .
laser spots were 200 mum in size and did not overlap .
the laser pulse had duration of 0.1 s and the energy delivered was 180 mw. in total , 140 and 124 laser spots were applied during the first and second laser sessions , respectively .
the superficial conjunctival pigmentation was removed after argon laser photoablation followed by cotton - tipped swab massage of the laser - treated area .
the patient had mild ocular pain after the laser photocoagulation , which lasted for 1 day .
immediately after the therapy , conjunctival injection was noted over the treated area ( figure 1 ( b )) and a conjunctival epithelial defect was left over the entire area of the treatment .
for the epithelial defect , levofloxacin 0.5 % ophthalmic solution ( cravit ) , and 0.1 % fluorometholone acetate ( flarex ) 4 times a day for one week were prescribed .
one week after the initial laser treatment , approximately half of the conjunctival pigmented area had been removed ( figure 1 ( c )) .
the treated eye completely healed , with no sign of inflammation , hemorrhage , or scarring .
the second laser photoablation session was also uneventfully performed on any remaining pigmentation .
one month after the second laser session , the temporal conjunctiva in the right eye had no residual pigmentation , injection , or scarring ( figure 1 ( d )) and the patient was very satisfied with the excellent cosmetic result .
at the visit 6 months after the treatment , recurred pigmentation or scarring was not noted .
3. discussion changes in skin pigmentation following a burn have been documented in many reports , but , to the best of our knowledge , postburn conjunctival pigmentation has not been reported in the literature .
the mechanism by which conjunctival pigmentation forms following thermal injury is thought to be conjunctival melanosis .
inflammatory mediators released after a thermal burn occurs ( e.g. , leukotrienes and prostaglandins ) may stimulate conjunctival melanocytes to increase melanin production [ 4 ] .
because the melanogenetic capacity of melanocytes correlates with the degree of ocular pigmentation ( iris color ) [ 5 ] , it was more likely for our patient , who had dark brown eyes , to develop postburn conjunctival pigmentation compared to a patient with lighter colored eyes .
the goal of ocular surface burn therapy is to restore the ocular surface to normal and the cornea to clarity .
cosmetic concerns rarely play a role in therapy decisions .
however , because of the white color of the conjunctiva and the visibility of the external ocular surface , the appearance of conjunctival pigmentation can be cosmetically upsetting to patients .
therefore , patients and physicians may decide to treat this condition , as was done in our case , even though the conjunctival and corneal surface has completely healed .
in a recent report by shin et al .
[ 6 ] , argon laser photoablation effectively removed a superficial conjunctival nevus , a benign conjunctival pigmentation .
the authors suggested that this method is especially helpful for removing large conjunctival nevi , for which surgical excision may result in scarring , dragging , and / or neovascularization [ 6 ] .
in our patient with relatively large , amorphous conjunctival pigmentation , surgical excision could have left a large conjunctival defect and suturing the conjunctiva would have been technically difficult because of the pigmentation shape .
additionally , argon laser photoablation provided fine control of pigmentation removal , minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissues [ 7 ] .
our patient required two sessions of photoablation treatment , which may be concerning to some physicians .
in our experience , a large number of laser burns ( i.e. , > 100 burns ) induce conjunctival injection , as shown in figure 1 ( b ) .
this made it difficult to distinguish between conjunctival pigmentation and normal conjunctiva .
also , one session of laser photoablation for large conjunctival pigmentation removal may leave a large conjunctival defect and induce severe pain both during and after the treatment .
in our case , ocular discomfort increased in severity during laser therapy , so breaking the treatment up into two sessions was more tolerable for our patient .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of conjunctival pigmentation caused by a thermal burn that was successfully removed with argon laser photoablation .
the technique seems safe and effective for treating postburn conjunctival pigmentation , but the use of this technique needs to be verified in a larger number of cases .

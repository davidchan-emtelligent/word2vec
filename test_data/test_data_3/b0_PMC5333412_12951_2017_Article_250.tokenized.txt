keywords cellular interaction silicon nanowires membrane wrapping http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 100006377purdue universityissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background as nanotechnology advances as an innovative option in clinical settings , researchers continue to explore a wide array of nanomaterials for applications as imaging and anti - cancer agents , for drug delivery purposes , and for therapeutics .
while this progress has been exciting for the future of medicine , these materials have not overcome the barrier of translating from benchtop to clinic .
in order for nanomaterials to advance as viable options for biological applications , further understanding of the basic interactions between mammalian cells and nanomaterials must be achieved .
in the past few decades , to understand how the cellular membrane can respond to the entry of external nanomaterials research has been mainly focused on finding the endocytosis pathways of zero dimensional ( 0d ) nanomaterials [ 1 - 5 ] .
limited efforts have also been made to understand the uptake of various 1d nanomaterials into cells .
for example , gold nanorods and magnetic nanowires have been heavily studied for imaging and tracking purposes [ 3 , 6 - 8 ] , but their specific uptake pathways were not well - studied .
single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) have also been of interest due to their high aspect ratio and uniqueness as a material .
yaron and coworkers showed that the uptake of swcnts was energy - dependent , suggesting that the pathway is endocytosis and not membrane penetration , but the surface and size is so dissimilar to that of other longer 1d materials that these uptake pathways cannot be translated [ 9 ] .
additionally , kostarelos and co - authors investigated previously investigated functionalized carbon nanotubes ( f - cnts ) with a variety of functional groups , including an ammonium functionalization .
the authors observed that the ammonium functionalized wires enter the cells at both 37 and 4 degreesc , ruling out a receptor - mediated pathway [ 10 ] .
notably , the dimensions of the f - cnts that were studied were on the scale of 1 nm in diameter and 1000 nm in length , making them unique from other 1d nanomaterials .
theoretical studies on both 0d and 1d nanostructures suggest that understanding the membrane mechanics during endocytosis is a critical aspect to explain internalization pathways of these nanostructures .
huang and co - authors designed a nanorod model using coarse - grained molecular dynamics to demonstrate that for endocytosis such model system needs to initially bind in an upright docking position , on the membrane plane , and then be wrapped by the membrane in order to proceed through a laying - down - then - standing - up sequence to enter cells [ 11 ] .
based on this work , it is reasonable to believe that membrane wrapping occurs as one of the first steps in endocytosis .
shi and co - authors used multi - walled carbon nanotubes to experimentally and theoretically illustrate that the cell entry of 1d nanomaterials can occur by tip recognition and rotation , but the authors do not delve into the details of internalization [ 12 ] .
yi and co - workers theoretically proved that cell membrane internalizes 1d nanomaterials following a near - perpendicular entry mode at small membrane tension but switches to a near - parallel interaction mode at large membrane tension [ 13 ] .
these theoretical models illustrate the necessity to experimentally understand the membrane interactions of high aspect ratio 1d nanomaterials .
due to the advantages of anisotropy and higher surface area to volume ratios than 0d nanomaterials , 1d nanomaterials can produce a stronger interaction with cells during the entering process .
these features indicate that 1d nanomaterials can be considered as a better system to explore the possible membrane wrapping mechanism in the uptake pathways of nanomaterials [ 14 , 15 ] .
to this end , in this work we use multiple microscopy methods to visualize key steps during the cellular internalization process of silicon nanowires .
since silicon nanowires are fabricated with a complete control of dimensions [ 16 , 17 ] , have flexible chemistry for surface modification [ 18 ] , have unique optical properties for in vitro and in vivo imaging [ 19 - 21 ] , they are excellent candidates for the studies of cellular uptake pathways .
silicon nanowires modified with amine groups are the focus of the study , as compared to as - grown sinws with hydroxyl groups and sinws with specific targeting groups conjugated , sinw - nh2 are able to be internalized in cells without targeting receptor mediated processes [ 22 ] .
we demonstrate the uptake pathway of 5 microm sinw - nh2 to be a physical membrane wrapping mechanism using cho - beta and hela cell lines .
studies at two different incubation temperatures , 37 and 4 degreesc , were carried out in order to evaluate temperature dependence of the membrane mechanics as well as to elucidate that the process is physically driven rather than receptor - mediated .
we chose 4 degreesc because it is well understood that many endocytic pathways are temperature dependent and that these pathways are limited to high temperature due to the large activation barrier , so uptake at a lower temperature would indicate that the mechanism is physically driven [ 23 ] .
methods synthesis and functionalization of sinws silicon nanowires were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) with 40 nm gold nanoparticles as growth catalysts and silane as a precursor .
sinws in length of 5 microm were chosen in this works because of the appropriate aspect ratio , low cytotoxicity and considerable high endocytosis rate to study the cellular internalization [ 22 ] .
the cvd growth was carried out in with a growth pressure of 100 torr , silane flow rate of 5 sccm , and growth time of 5 min [ 22 ] .
a representative tem micrograph ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) shows that the dimensions of the wires are consistent with the growth conditions .
the as - grown sinws were first treated with thermal oxidation in atmosphere at 900 degreesc for 2 min in order to clean and oxidize the surface for further modification .
the thermally oxidized sinws were then submerged in a solution of 1 % ( 3 - aminopropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( aptms ) ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) in pure ethanol overnight at room temperature .
the substrates were then rinsed and submerged in pure ethanol at 80 degreesc in order to stabilize the functional groups .
after 2 h , the substrates were removed and dried under a stream of nitrogen .
sinws - nh2 were then removed from the substrate into pure ethanol via sonication for several seconds .
the sinw - nh2 suspensions were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm three times to wash away impurities .
the wires were then resuspended in a complete roswell park memorial institute ( rpmi ) 1640 cell culture medium with 10 % fbs , 1 % l - glutamine , 1 % penicillin / streptococcus for future use .
in order to confirm that the amine modification was successful , unmodified sinws and sinws - nh2 were sonicated in ultrapure water and placed in disposable folded capillary cells for zeta potential measurements .
the concentration of sinws and sinw - nh2 in each capillary cell was estimated to be 10 microg / ml. measurements were carried out on a malvern zetasizer nano series .
to further confirm and quantify amine functionalization on the modified silicon nanowires , the authors performed fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) ( thermo nicolet nexus ftir ) as well as x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) analysis .
as grown nanowires on growth substrates were modified with amine and used as the modified samples for measurements here .
comparison between the ftir spectrum for the unmodified silicon nanowires ( blue curve in additional file 1 : figure s2 ) and the ftir for the amine - modified wires ( red curve in additional file 1 : figure s2 ) shows that a peak near 1600 cm - 1 in the spectrum for the amine - modified wires is visible and corresponds to the nh2 bending mode , confirming the presence of amine groups .
the xps spectrum measured from the modified sinw - nh2 sample ( additional file 1 : figure s3 ) shows atomic percentages of n and si of 1.2 and 20.3 % , respectively .
based on this result , the amine coverage was estimated to be 0.61 mol / nm2 , which is close to the coverage previously modeled based on the total covalently bonded aptes coverage on silica [ 24 ] .
cell culture we cultured immortalized chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with folate receptor beta ( cho - beta ) for our cellular interaction studies .
our previous study investigated the uptake of sinw - nh2 using both cho and cho - beta cells .
the findings showed that sinw - nh2 were successfully internalized by both cell types .
therefore , cho - beta was chosen as the cell line of choice due to their success in internalizing sinw - nh2 [ 22 ] .
typically , cho - beta cells were cultured in the complete rpmi 1640 mentioned above at 37 degreesc in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % co2 .
cell viability was maintained and confirmed by cell morphology under optical microscopy during the testing periods discussed in the work [ 25 , 26 ] .
for optical studies , the cho - beta cells were cultured on sterile glass cover slides in 35 x 10 mm tissue culture dishes with one million cells per milliliter .
once they came to confluency , the cells were ready for microscopy studies .
optical microscopy to prepare samples for the optical images , the medium was removed from the culture dish and the dish was rinsed with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) .
1 ml of the prepared nanowire solution was added to the dish and the cells were incubated with the wires for various time points .
before imaging , the sinw - nh2 solution was removed and the dishes were washed with 1 ml pbs .
to achieve better focus of live cells , we prepare samples as follows .
a microscope slide was prepared by adhering double sided tape along the long edges of the slide .
the glass cover slide taken from the cell dish was then placed on top of the prepared microscope slide .
one side of the cover slide was sealed with nail varnish .
fresh medium was added between the cover glass and the slide followed by sealing the other side .
bright field , fluorescent , and dark field images were collected using an olympus bx - 51 optical microscope .
transmission electron microscopy once the cells were incubated with the wires for a given amount of time , the nanowire solution was removed via pipette and rinsed with 1 ml of pbs .
the pbs was replaced with 2 ml of 2.5 % glutaraldehyde and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer solution ( fix ) .
this solution was allowed to sit for several minutes before being poured off .
another 2 ml of the fix was added and the cells were scraped from the bottom of the dish and transferred to a small conical centrifuge tube .
the cells were spun down , the old fix was removed and 1.5 ml of fresh fix was added .
the remainder of the processing was done at the purdue life sciences microscopy facility .
cells were embedded in 2 % agarose , and post - fixed in buffered 1 % osmium tetroxide containing 0.8 % potassium ferricyanide .
cells were then en bloc stained in 4 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol , and embedded in lx - 112 resin .
sections with a 90 nm thickness for the 37 degreesc and 180 nm for the 4 degreesc samples were cut using a reichert - jung ultracut e ultramicrotome and stained with 2 % uranyl acetate and lead citrate .
images were acquired on a fei tecnai g220 electron microscope equipped with a lab6 source and operated at 100 kv. confocal microscopy after incubation , the sinw - nh2 solution was removed and the dishes were washed twice with 1 ml pbs .
pbs was removed and 1 ml of 5 microm 1,1 ' - dioctadecyl - 3,3,3 ' , 3 ' - tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ( dii ) was added and allowed to incubate at 37 degreesc for 20 min .
the dii was then removed and the dish was rinsed twice with 1 ml of pbs .
pbs was replaced with 2 ml of fresh culture medium and the cells were incubated at 37 degreesc for another 10 min to rinse off excess dii .
the old medium was removed before cells were imaged .
the glass cover slide was placed on a microscope slide using the aforementioned preparation .
images were taken using an olympus fluoview 300 confocal laser scanning microscope with a 543 nm excitation .
for each area , approximately 100 images were taken at 10 microm steps through the z - axis and the images obtained towards the center of the top and bottom of the cells are presented here .
results and discussion zeta potential measurement confirms successful surface functionalization the as - grown sinws were surface modified with amine groups to introduce a positive surface charge .
the zeta potential measurements were carried out in triplicate to confirm the success of functionalization .
the zeta potential of the unmodified sinws was measured to be - 29.7 +/ - 7.85 mv , due to the oxide layer on the sinw surface .
the zeta potential for the sinw - nh2 was measured to be + 28.1 +/ - 5.11 mv , consistent with that the amine groups are protonated under neutral conditions .
such change in zeta potential after the modification confirms a successful functionalization .
since the cell membrane has slightly negative charge [ 27 ] , the positive charge of the sinw - nh2 will ensure charge - charge interaction between the wires and cell membrane .
the interaction between sinw - nh2 and cells is insensitive to temperature as we previously reported [ 22 ] , no obvious binding or internalization was observed in the cho - beta cells treated with the same concentration of unmodified sinws even after 11 h incubation ( see additional file 1 : figure s4 ) .
we attributed the observation of no interaction to the lack of charge - charge interaction between the unmodified sinws and the cell membrane [ 22 ] .
this is the also the reason why we chose to focus on amine - functionalized sinws in this paper .
bright field and dark field transmission optical imaging was utilized not only to confirm the interaction of the sinw - nh2 , but also to investigate if temperature played a role in membrane interaction .
the bright field images in fig. 1 were used to visualize the cells , while the dark field images were taken to confirm the presence of the sinw - nh2 .
sinw - nh2 were co - cultured with cells at both 37 and 4 degreesc for 3 , 5 and 10 h , respectively .
pbs was used to wash the cells prior to imaging , so any wires in the medium or weakly interacting wires were removed .
notably , due to the limitation of the optical transmission imaging , bound wires and internalized wires cannot be differentiated , therefore both scenarios were considered as the wires interacting with the cells .
to directly observe the internalized wires , we also used the tem and confocal microscopy imaging and results are presented later in this manuscript .
the control groups were cells incubated at 37 and 4 degreesc without the presence of wires for 3 h. as shown in fig. 1a , after incubation for 3 h at 37 degreesc , sinw - nh2 were observed binding to the membrane of the cells .
as the incubation time increased , more wires could be seen interacting with the cells .
figure 1b depicts the wire interactions at 4 degreesc and we noticed similar trends of interaction , albeit with less wires observed than the 37 degreesc group .
binding was also observed after the 3 - h incubation period in both the 37 and 4 degreesc optical images , a slight increase in the number of wires interacting with the cells can be seen in the 5 h panels of both the 37 and 4 degreesc optical images , and many wires were still visible in the image after 10 h. fig. 1 optical microscopy images of sinw - nh2 after a 37 degreesc incubation and b 4 degreesc incubation ( bottom ) with cho - beta cells .
the images of control group , after 3 h of incubation group , after 5 h of incubation group , and after 10 h of incubation group are displayed , respectively .
scale bars 20 microm fig. 2 statistical representation of the numbers of wires interacting per cell as a function of incubation time at 37 degreesc ( green ) and 4 degreesc ( blue ) .
error bars are standard deviations measured from 5 sample areas for each time point figure 2 plotted the quantitative analysis of wires interacting with cells as a function of incubation time at 37 and 4 degreesc .
wires were counted from the overlay of the bright and dark field images .
five areas measuring 70 microm x 50 microm were examined for each sample .
numbers of wires interacting per cell measured and standard deviation of the data presented as error bars are plotted in fig. 2. figure 2 showed similar trends for both temperatures as functions of the incubation period with more wires interacting with cells at 37 degreesc .
the average rate of interaction over the first 5 h of the incubation period was estimated to be 0.5 wires per cell per hour at 37 degreesc ( green curve ) , while 0.4 wires per cell per hour at 4 degreesc , likely indicating a slightly slower internalization for 4 degreesc .
such small difference can be attributed to the fact that the cells incubated at 4 degreesc were not as active as they were at 37 degreesc .
it is well - known that receptor mediated endocytosis processes do not happen at low temperatures [ 28 - 30 ] .
a small decrease in the number of wires interacting with cells after 5 h at 37 degreesc was observed .
we attributed the decrease after 5 h in the number of wires interacting with cells to exocytosis , as it is consistent with the reported values between 6 and 8 h at 37 degreesc for the typical time scale for exocytosis of nanoparticles and nanorods [ 29 ] .
since it is a competing process between endocytosis and exocytosis once the sinws enter the cells , we attributed the decrease in the number of wires interacting with cells after 5 h at 37 degreesc to exocytosis .
the interaction between sinw - nh2 and cells was found to be insensitive to temperature in our studies , indicating that the charge - charge attraction induced interaction between sinw - nh2 and cells is not through the receptor mediated pathway but a physically driven process .
cross - section tem images indicate membrane wrapping we utilized cross - sectional tem studies to visualize the relative position of bound and internalized nanowires to cell membrane .
specifically , cross - sectional tem images can confirm that the sinw - nh2 are internalized by the cells and can be used to examine how the membrane of the cells interacts with the wires , offering insight into the uptake pathway .
figure 3 shows cross - sectional tem images of cho - beta cells cultured with sinw - nh2 and fixed at 2 , 3 , 5 , and 10 h. it represents snapshots of the internalization process at 37 degreesc and highlights how the membrane of the cells interacts with the wires .
in the first 2 h , the wires were just starting to interact with the cell membrane via a non - specific charge - charge interaction process .
in fig. 3a , the wire is observed to be tangent with the membrane , but not yet entering , showing the binding stage of the internalization process .
after 3 h of incubation , the membrane is shown changing its shape in fig. 3b in order to accommodate the wires .
after 5 and 10 h , depicted in fig. 3c , d , respectively , the membrane has closely wrapped around the wires and pockets have formed , with an average gap of 18 nm between the wires and the membrane , as a means to " swallow " the wires .
the formation of the pockets and the fact that the wires were not to target a specific receptor confirms that the uptake pathway of the sinw - nh2 at 37 degreesc is via the membrane wrapping mechanism. fig. 3 cross section tem micrographs represent cho - beta cells incubated with 5 microm wires for a 2 , b 3 , c 5 , and d 10 h at 37 degreesc .
scale bars are 0.2 microm in a - c and 0.5 microm in d , respectively to confirm the internalization of sinw - nh2 is also occurring at a lower temperature than 37 degreesc , we performed the cross - sectional tem experiment at 4 degreesc .
the sinw - nh2 were co - cultured with cells in 4 degreesc and fixed at different incubation periods up to 24 h. the uptake and internalization of the sinw - nh2 at 4 degreesc is depicted in fig. 4. the key steps during this process , including the initial interaction induced wire - membrane binding ( fig. 4a ) , the membrane accommodating the wires ( fig. 4b ) , and the internalization with the formed pocket of membrane closely surrounding the wires ( fig. 4c ) are observed at 4 degreesc .
representative images obtained indicate that the binding is consistent with the optical microscopy data in fig. 2. the internalization was confirmed at 24 h incubated samples at 4 degreesc , later than the observation from optical and fluorescence images , which could be attributed to limitation of the tem cross section sample preparation and small sampling acquired through tem .
in summary , the temperature independent observations of the internalization and the formation of the membrane pockets are strong evidence to support the membrane wrapping mechanism and that this mechanism is , indeed , due to a physical force exerted on the membrane by the wires. fig. 4 cross section tem micrographs represent cho - beta cells incubated with sinw - nh2 for a 2 , b 12 , c 24 h at 4 degreesc .
inset in c represents the lower magnification image of the wire in c. scale bars are 0.2 microm in a - c and 0.5 microm in the inset , respectively confocal fluorescence confirms the physical membrane wrapping we performed confocal fluorescence microscopy on the cell samples cultured with sinw - nh2 , in which 3d information about nanowires and cells can be obtained through scanning along the z - axis and used to confirm the internalization of the wires .
dii ( red ) was used to stain the cell membrane .
first , fig. 5a shows a control study in which sinws were incubated with dii in the cell medium without the presence of the cells .
after one hour of incubation , the dark field image ( fig. 5a left ) shows the presence of wires and the fluorescence image confirms that the wires do not fluoresce , suggesting the dii does not label the surface of nanowires. fig. 5 confocal images of sinws after incubation with cho - beta cells .

b the transmission and fluorescence images of the control and c after 10 h of incubation with sinw - nh2 at 37 degreesc .
arrows represent location of wires .
scale bars 20 microm figure 5b , c show bright field and fluorescence images obtained from the control group without wires ( fig. 5b ) and the cho - beta cells co - cultured with sinw - nh2 for 10 h at 37 degreesc ( fig. 5c ) .
bright field optical images on the left column of fig. 5 show the presence of wires and the fluorescence images on the right column were used to locate the cell membrane , therefore indicating the interaction between wires and cellular membrane .
specifically , since the images plotted here were obtained towards the center of the top and bottom of the cells along the z scanning under the confocal microscope , the wires shown in focus in the bright field are in the focal plane therefore considered to be inside the cell .
clearly different from fig. 5b , c demonstrated internalization of sinw - nh2 by cho - beta cells .
importantly , fig. 5c also shows that wire - shaped fluorescent signals present in the cells , indicating the internalized sinw - nh2 became fluorescent .
together with observation that sinws were not directly labeled by dil from fig. 5a , these results also suggest that internalized sinw - nh2 is through membrane wrapping .
more fluorescence images obtained from 2 - and 5 - h incubation periods along with a plot showing average number of wires per cell internalized as a function of incubation time period are included in additional file 1 ( figures s5 , s6 , respectively ) .
the confocal experiment was also performed using the immortalized hela cell line using both unmodified sinws and sinw - nh2 .
the results showed that , much like we saw with the cho - beta cells previously [ 22 ] , the unmodified silicon nanowires did not interact with the cells , even after 5 h at both 37 and 4 degreesc ( additional file 1 : figures s7 , s8 ) .
for amine - modifed sinws , fig. 6 shows top and orthogonal views , demonstrating the co - localization of amine - modified sinws with cell membranes after 2 h of incubation at 37 degreesc , which is consistent with our findings with cho - beta cells .
these results demonstrate that the sinw - nh2 are internalized via a physically driven , membrane wrapping pathway , rather than an energy - dependent , receptor - mediated process. fig. 6 confocal images of sinw - nh2 after incubation with hela cells .

the black arrows indicate the position where the orthogonal view was taken .
scale bar is 10 microm conclusion we have successfully visualized the key steps of internalization of sinw - nh2 into cells as illustrated in scheme 1 , using optical , confocal fluorescence and transmission electron microscopies .
specifically , we confirmed that sinw - nh2 are internalized by cho - beta and hela cells via a membrane wrapping mechanism for the first time and that this process is most likely due to physical force exerted on the membrane .
optical microscopy images at 37 degreesc incubation as well as 4 degreesc incubation show that the charge - charge induced binding and interactions occur regardless of temperature , indicating that the mechanism is physical rather than receptor mediated .
further , tem micrographs captured the key steps of interactions between the cell membrane and the wires showing that the internalized wires are surrounded by pocket of the membrane .
the confocal images independently demonstrate that the wires are successfully internalized .
fluorescence of the wires internalized confirms that the mechanism is membrane wrapping .
this work provides better understanding of cellular uptake pathways for 1d nanomaterials without specific targeting ligands .
since the interaction presented here is physical , this work opens up the potential for using 1d materials to understand membrane mechanics through physical stress exerted on the membrane .

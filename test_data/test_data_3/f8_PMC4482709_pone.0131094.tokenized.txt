channelrhodopsin ( chr ) is a light - gated cation channel that responds to blue light .
since chr can be readily expressed in specific neurons to precisely control their activities by light , it has become a powerful tool in neuroscience .
although the recently solved crystal structure of a chimeric chr , c1c2 , provided the structural basis for chr , our understanding of the molecular mechanism of chr still remains limited .
here we performed electrophysiological analyses and all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , to investigate the importance of the intracellular and central constrictions of the ion conducting pore observed in the crystal structure of c1c2 .
our electrophysiological analysis revealed that two glutamate residues , glu122 and glu129 , in the intracellular and central constrictions , respectively , should be deprotonated in the photocycle .
the simulation results suggested that the deprotonation of glu129 in the central constriction leads to ion leakage in the ground state , and implied that the protonation of glu129 is important for preventing ion leakage in the ground state .
moreover , we modeled the 13 - cis retinal bound ; i.e. , activated c1c2 , and performed md simulations to investigate the conformational changes in the early stage of the photocycle .
our simulations suggested that retinal photoisomerization induces the conformational change toward channel opening , including the movements of tm6 , tm7 and tm2 .
these insights into the dynamics of the ground states and the early photocycle stages enhance our understanding of the channel function of chr .

introduction most organisms perceive light - carried information by using rhodopsin family proteins , which are covalently bound to a retinal chromophore .
during evolution , rhodopsin family proteins have acquired divergent functions , as light sensors , ion pumps , and ion channels .
channelrhodopsin ( chr ) is the only channel - type rhodopsin family protein identified thus far .
chr was originally isolated from chlamydomonas reinhardtii , and was characterized as a light - gated cation channel in 2002 [ 1 ] .
upon excitation by blue light , chr permeates several monovalent and divalent cations , including h + , na + , k + , and ca2 + .
as the net inward flow of cations under physiological ionic conditions depolarizes cell membranes , chr has become not only an attractive target of biophysical studies , but also a powerful tool for the neuroscience field ( optogenetics ) .
since chr was first expressed in mammalian neurons in 2005 [ 2,3 ] , the number of studies using chr has rapidly increased [ 4 ] .
the integration of chr and fiber - optic devices allows the control of neural activity with high spatial and temporal precision , even within systems such as freely moving mammals .
thus , chr is now recognized as a powerful tool for modulating neural activity , in order to elucidate the neural circuit foundations of normal and pathological behaviors [ 4,5 ] .
however , despite the rapid progress in optogenetics [ 4 ] , our understanding of the mechanism by which chr permeates cations in response to light is still limited .
previous electrophysiological analyses of chr revealed that its n - terminal extracellular domain ( n - domain ) and seven - transmembrane ( tm ) domain are sufficient for the channel function , while its large c - terminal intracellular domain is dispensable [ 1,6 ] .
in the center of the tm domain , an all - trans retinal ( atr ) is covalently bound to lys296 ( lys257 in chr2 ) on tm7 , thus forming the protonated schiff base , and the positive charge of the schiff base is stabilized by two counterions , glu162 and asp292 ( glu123 and asp253 in chr2 , respectively ) .
upon receiving blue light , the all - trans retinal ( atr ) isomerizes to 13 - cis retinal ( 13 - cisr ) , which triggers a series of chemical reactions and conformational changes , called the photocycle .
electrophysiological and spectroscopic experiments revealed that the chr photocycle comprises the early photoproducts , p1 500 and p2 390 , the conducting state , p3 520 , the late intermediate state , p4 480 , and other intermediates in the branched side pathways [ 7 - 12 ] .
in addition to these electrophysiological and spectroscopic analyses , the 2.3 a resolution structure of the chimeric chr of c. reinhardtii chr1 and chr2 ( c1c2 ) provided detailed insights into the architecture of chr , including its cation - conducting pathway [ 6 ] .
chr forms a dimer in this crystal structure , and the electronegative pore in each monomer , formed by tms 1 , 2 , 3 , and 7 , probably functions as the cation - conducting pathway , consistent with the previous computational and electrophysiological studies [ 6,13 - 19 ] ( fig 1a ) .
the crystal structure revealed that an extracellular vestibule , formed by the n - domain and extracellular loops 1 and 3 , expands to a diameter of about 8 a , and suggested that this passage would allow water molecules to move from the extracellular side to the middle of the pathway [ 6 ] ( fig 1b , panel a ) .
in contrast to the extracellular half , the intracellular half of the pathway is occluded at two constrictions , revealing a closed state .
this is consistent with the fact that c1c2 was crystallized and harvested in the dark .
these two constrictions , called the intracellular and central constrictions ( corresponding to fig 1a 1b and 1c respectively ) , contain titratable residues , including glu122 and glu129 , which are highly conserved in the chr family , but not in other rhodopsin family members .
these residues link the tm helices by hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge to occlude the conducting pathway , and these interactions are considered to be disrupted in the conducting state .
although the crystal structure of c1c2 identified certain residues that may be important for channel opening , it remains unknown how the residues in these constrictions prevent ion leakage in the ground state , and how the retinal isomerization induces the conformational change towards channel opening .

in this study , we investigated the functional roles of glu122 and glu129 in the two constrictions , by electrophysiological analyses and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .
the results revealed that glu129 in the central constriction is important for preventing ion leakage in the ground state .
in addition , we analyzed the conformational change upon retinal isomerization , which is the very first stage in the photocycle , by performing the md simulation with 13 - cis retinal - bound c1c2 .
materials and methods initial structures and system preparation the atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of chr ( protein data bank ( pdb ) entry 3ug9 [ 6 ]) were retrieved from the pdb .
two disordered regions ( gly110 - thr117 and glu332 - asn327 ) were modeled with the program modeller [ 20 ] .
the protonation state of each glutamate or aspartate was determined based on the pattern of hydrogen bonds observed in the crystal structure , as well as the results of the propka calculation [ 21 ] , except for glu163 , which was reported to be deprotonated in the ground state [ 22 ] .
the phosphoryloleoyl phosphatidylcholines ( popcs ) were generated by using the vmd plugin [ 23 ] .
the full simulation system included chr , popc , water molecules , and chloride and sodium ions .
the system size was 128 ( a ) x 128 ( a ) x 128 ( a ) , and contained about 190,000 atoms .
all of the water molecules observed in the crystal structure were kept .

molecular dynamics simulations molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the program namd 2.8 [ 29 ] .
the systems were first energy minimized for 1,000 steps with fixed positions of the non - hydrogen atoms , and then for another 1,000 steps with 10 kcal / mol restraints for the non - hydrogen atoms , except for the lipid molecules within 5.0 a from the proteins .
next , equilibrations were performed for 0.01 ns under nvt conditions , with 10 kcal / mol restraints for the heavy atoms of the protein .
finally , equilibrations were performed for 0.5 ns under npt conditions with the 1.0 kcal / mol restraints .
in the equilibration and production processes , the pressure and temperature were set to 1.0 atm and 300 k , respectively .
constant temperature was maintained by using langevin dynamics .
constant pressure was maintained by using the langevin piston nose - hoover method [ 30 ] .

we performed each simulation at least twice with different initial velocities , and obtained similar results from these trajectories .
modeling of 13 - cis retinal bound c1c2 the coordinates of lys - 13 - cisr were obtained from the k - intermediate of bacteriorhodopsin ( pdbid : 1ixf [ 32 ]) .
the main chain atoms ( i.e. , the c , o , n , and ca atoms ) and the beta - ionone ring of this lys - 13 - cisr molecule were superimposed on those of lys296 - atr of c1c2 , and then the lys296 - atr of c1c2 was replaced with the lys - 13 - cisr .
after this replacement , 1,000 steps of energy minimization were performed with fixed positions of the non - hydrogen atoms .
subsequently , another 1,000 steps of energy minimization were performed with 10 kcal / mol restraints for the non - hydrogen atoms , except for the lipid molecules within 5.0 a from the protein .
the equilibration and production runs were performed in the same manner as described above .
the topology and force field parameters for 13 - cis retinal were the same as those for atr , which are also compatible with 13 - cis retinal .
trajectory analysis the residue - averaged root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) and the correlation matrix for all calpha atoms were calculated as described previously [ 33 ] .

the correlation coefficient calculations were performed after superimposing each trajectory frame on transmembrane helices 3 - 5 of the crystal structure .
electrophysiology for electrophysiology , hek293 cells were cultured on poly - lysine - coated , glass bottom culture dishes ( matsunami ) , and were transfected with 0.1 mg of a plasmid construct encoding the gfp - tagged c1c2 or the gfp - tagged c1c2 mutants .
at 24 - 30 h after transfection , the cells were placed in bath medium , containing 140 mm nacl , 1 mm cacl2 , 2 mm mgcl2 , 10 mm hepes , and 5 mm glucose ( ph 7.4 with naoh ) , under an inverted microscope ( olympus ix71 ) .
a borosilicate patch pipette ( harvard apparatus ) , with a resistance of about 5 - 8 momega , was filled with 140 mm kcl , 5 mm egta , 2 mm mgcl2 , and 10 mm hepes ( ph 7.2 with koh ) .
the c1c2 currents were recorded in both the voltage - clamp mode and whole - cell configuration .
the cells were held at a membrane potential of - 80 mv , and were depolarized by 10 mv voltage steps of 1.8 s up to 170 mv. the light - dependent currents were activated 200 ms after the depolarization step , with 465 nm light ( 1.5 mwmm - 2 ) for 1,000 ms , elicited by a high power led illumination system ( lex2 - b , brainvision ) connected to an a / d converter ( digidata 1440 , axon cns , molecular devices ) , and controlled by the pclamp10 software ( axon cns , molecular devices ) .
currents were measured using an axopatch 200b amplifier ( axon cns , molecular devices ) , filtered at 2 khz and sampled at 5 khz , using a digidata 1440a digitizer ( axon cns , molecular devices ) controlled by the pclamp10 software ( axon cns , molecular devices ) .
fluorescence measurements to estimate the membrane expression levels of c1c2 and its mutants , the ratio of the membrane and cytosolic fluorescence values was determined .
the cells were transfected with 0.1 mg wt c1c2 or c1c2 mutants , using fugene 6 , and cultured for 30 h. they were then washed with pbs , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in pbs for 20 min at room temperature ( 20degreesc ) , and washed again with pbs before microscopy observations .
gfp fluorescence was observed with a laser confocal microscope ( fv1000 olympus ) .
results and discussion deprotonation of glu122 and glu129 is important for channel activity the crystal structure of the chimeric chr of chr1 and chr2 ( c1c2 ) revealed the central and intracellular constrictions in the pore [ 6 ] .
in the intracellular constriction , the salt bridge between glu121 and arg307 links tm2 to tm7 , and the hydrogen bond between glu122 and his173 links tm2 to tm3 ( fig 1b panel b ) .
in the central constriction , the hydrogen bond between glu129 and asn297 links tm2 to tm7 and occludes the pore ( fig 1b panel c ) .
in this crystal structure , hydrogen bonds are formed between glu122 and his173 , and glu129 and asn297 , suggesting the protonation of the side chains of glu122 and glu129 [ 6 ] .
to clarify the functional importance of the protonation states of these glutamate residues , we prepared the e122q and e129q mutants , expressed them in hek293 cells , and recorded their photocurrents in response to 465 - nm light pulses .
the results revealed that the e122q and e129q single mutants each showed a significant decrease in the photocurrent , and that the double mutation e122q / e129q almost completely abolished the photocurrent ( fig 2a and 2d - 2g ) , despite their stable membrane expression ( fig 2b and 2c ) .
given that the glutamine mutation can mimic the protonated glutamic acid , these results suggested that glu122 and glu129 ( glu83 and glu90 in chr2 ) are deprotonated during the photocycle .
these findings are consistent with previous spectroscopic studies showing that glu90 in chr2 is protonated in the dark / closed state , and its protonation state changes during the photocycle [ 13,34 ] .
in addition , the calculation of the kinetic parameters , tauon and tauoff , showed that the e122q and e129q mutations affected the tauon and tauoff values , respectively ( fig 2h and 2i ) .

deprotonation of both glu122 and glu129 results in proton leakage in the ground state to investigate the effects of the protonation states of glu122 and glu129 on the chr structure , we created atomic models of c1c2 with different protonation states based on the crystal structure ( pdb entry 3ug9 [ 6 ]) , and performed all - atom md simulations in the presence of a 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( popc ) lipid bilayer .
we first performed the atr - e122p - e129p simulation ( table 1 ) .
in this simulation , the overall structure was stable , and no large structural changes were observed ( fig 3a ; gray ) .
the interactions in both the central and intracellular constrictions were also preserved during the 150 - ns simulation .
the salt bridge between glu121 and arg307 in the intracellular constriction , and the hydrogen bond between glu129 and asn297 in the central constriction , were stable ( fig 3c and 3f ; gray line ) .
the hydrogen bond between glu122 and his173 in the intracellular constriction was disrupted and reformed again during the 150 - ns simulation ( fig 3d ) .
as a result , a small number of water molecules entered through the intracellular constriction ( fig 3g ) .
the extracellular side of the channel pathway , especially the extracellular vestibule observed in the crystal structure , was filled with water molecules ( fig 3g ) .
however , no water channel was formed between the intra - and extracellular sides of the membrane , due to the stable hydrogen - bonds of the central constriction .

we next compared the results of the atr - e122p - e129p and atr - e122deltap - e129deltap simulations ( table 1 ) , to examine the effects of the protonation states of glu122 and glu129 .
in the atr - e122deltap - e129deltap simulation , the overall structure was stable ( fig 3a ; green ) , but several changes in the intracellular and central constrictions were observed .
in the intracellular constriction , the salt bridge between glu121 and arg307 was also stable over the 150 - ns simulation ( fig 3c ; red line ) , while the hydrogen bond between glu122 and his173 was disrupted , as a result of the deprotonation of glu122 ( fig 3d ; cyan line ) .
instead , the deprotonated glu122 formed a stable salt bridge with the side chain of arg307 ( fig 3e ; green line ) .
in the central constriction , the hydrogen bond between glu129 and asn297 was disrupted upon the glu129 deprotonation ( fig 3f ; magenta line ) .
the water distribution in the atr - e122deltap - e129deltap simulation revealed that water molecules from both the intracellular and extracellular entrances filled the channel pathway , which resulted in the formation of the water - mediated hydrogen - bond network connecting the intra - and extracellular sides of the membrane ( fig 3h ) .
the formation of this water - mediated hydrogen - bond network in the ground state may result in the leakage of protons across the membrane , without channel activation .
therefore , the protonation of glu122 and / or glu129 is important for preventing ion leakage in the ground state .
glu129 protonation is important for preventing proton leakage to investigate the effect of the deprotonation of each glutamate residue , we performed simulations in which either glu122 or glu129 was deprotonated ( atr - e122deltap - e129p and atr - e122p - e129deltap ; table 1 ) .
in these simulations , similar structural changes to those in the atr - e122deltap - e129deltap simulation were observed : the glu129 - asn297 hydrogen bond was disrupted upon glu129 deprotonation in the atr - e122p - e129deltap simulation ( fig 4a ; cyan line ) , while the glu122 - his173 hydrogen bond was disrupted and the salt bridge between glu122 and arg307 was formed upon glu122 deprotonation in the atr - e122deltap - e129p simulation ( fig 4b and 4c ; red line ) .
however , the water distributions revealed that no water channels were formed in these simulations , suggesting that ion or proton leakage did not occur ( fig 4d and 4e ) .
in the atr - e122p - e129deltap simulation , the water permeation was disturbed by the interaction between glu122 and his173 , and a small number of water molecules entered through these constrictions , similar to the atr - e122p - e129p simulation .
in the atr - e122deltap - e129p simulation , the hydrogen bond between glu129 and asn297 blocked the water permeation .
in contrast to the case of the glu122 - his173 interaction , no water molecules passed through the channel pathway , because of the stable glu129 - asn297 hydrogen bond .
therefore , we hypothesized that either glu122 or glu129 is protonated , to prevent the water channel formation and proton leakage .

a recent structural analysis of the c1c2 variant under neutral - ph conditions suggested that glu122 is deprotonated in the ground state [ 35 ] .
in this c1c2 variant , although the overall structure is essentially the same as that of the previous c1c2 structure obtained under low - ph conditions , the hydrogen bond between glu122 and his173 is absent , and instead glu122 forms a salt bridge with arg307 .
this result suggested that glu122 is deprotonated and interacts with arg307 , rather than his173 , under neutral - ph conditions , as observed in the atr - e122deltap - e129deltap and atr - e122deltap - e129p simulations ( fig 3d , 3e and fig 4b , 4c ) .
therefore , we concluded that glu122 is deprotonated in the ground state , and that the protonated glu129 and its hydrogen bond with asn297 are important for preventing ion leakage across the membrane .
our electrophysiological analysis revealed the decreased photocurrent in the e122q mutant ( fig 2a ) .
given the structural similarity between glutamine and protonated glutamic acid , a transient interaction between gln122 and his173 may occur in this mutant , as observed in the atr - e122p - e129p and atr - e122p - e129deltap simulations ( fig 3d and fig 4b ) .
in these glu122 protonated simulations , the interaction between glu122 and his173 restricted the entrance of water molecules through the intracellular constriction ( fig 3g ; fig 4d ) .
therefore , in the e122q mutant , a similar interaction between gln122 and his173 might disturb the water and ion permeation at the intracellular constriction ( fig 3g ) , resulting in the decreased photocurrent of the e122q mutant .
our electrophysiological analysis also revealed the decreased photocurrent and increased tauoff parameter of the e129q mutant ( fig 2a and 2i ) , suggesting the importance of glu129 deprotonation during the photocycle .
consistent with our proposal , recent studies showed that glu129 is deprotonated and negatively charged in the conducting state , which is important for the ion selectivity [ 13,36 - 38 ] .
however , the timing of the glu129 deprotonation in the photocycle still remains controversial .
notably , some studies showed that glu129 ( glu90 ) is deprotonated in the early stage of the photocycle of chr2 [ 13,36 ] , while others indicated that it is deprotonated in the desensitized stage of the photocycle in both chr2 and c1c2 [ 37,38 ] .
the results of our electrophysiological analysis of the e129q mutant are consistent with the latter results , since the mutation affected tauoff , rather than tauon ( fig 2h and 2i ) .
it should be noted here that a recent study suggested that the timing of the glu129 ( or glu90 in chr2 ) deprotonation is different between the chr2 and chr1 / chr2 chimeras , including c1c2 [ 38 ] .
further spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses of chr may be required .
in addition , a recent study demonstrated that the replacement of glu90 in chr2 with lysine or arginine converted chr2 into a chloride - selective channel [ 39 ] .
another report also revealed that the replacement of several residues in c1c2 , including glu129 , converted it into an anion - selective channel [ 40 ] .
in these anion - selective chr variants , different hydrogen bond and / or salt bridge pairs from glu129 and asn297 might prevent ion leakage in the ground state .
atr isomerization to 13 - cisr results in the movement of the cytoplasmic regions of tm6 and tm7 the initial event of the photocycle , upon the absorption of blue light , is the isomerization of atr to 13 - cis retinal ( 13 - cisr ) , which occurs on a femto - second time scale [ 8,10 ] .
to investigate this initial conformational change in the photocycle , we performed the md simulation of c1c2 with 13 - cisr .
the initial structure was modeled by simply replacing the atr moiety of the crystal structure with 13 - cisr , and subsequent energy minimization .
we assumed that glu122 was deprotonated in the ground state , considering the results of the atr - e122deltap - e129p simulation , as described above .
in this 13 - cisr bound simulation ( 13 - cisr - e122deltap - e129p ; table 1 ) , conformational changes in the tm domains were observed .
the 13 - methyl group of 13 - cisr shifted toward the cytoplasmic side and pushed out the indole ring of trp262 ( trp223 in chr2 ) on tm6 ( fig 5a - 5c ) .
the local steric conflict of the 13 - methyl group with trp262 caused the subsequent movement of the cytoplasmic half of tm6 ( fig 6a - 6c ) .
this movement was consistent with previous studies of other microbial rhodopsins , such as bacteriorhodopsin ( br ) and sensory rhodopsin ii ( srii ) , which indicated that the retinal isomerization and the steric collision between the 13 - methyl group of 13 - cisr and the tryptophan residue on tm6 ( trp182 in br , trp171 in srii and trp262 in c1c2 ) cause the movements of tm6 and tm7 [ 25 - 28 ] .
to verify the functional importance of trp262 , we measured the photocurrents of the w262a mutant of c1c2 in hek293 cells , and found that this mutant completely abolished the photocurrent , despite its robust membrane expression ( fig 5d , 5e and 5f ) .
these results suggested that the presence of a bulky side chain adjacent to the 13 - methyl group of 13 - cisr is important for triggering the channel opening .

in addition to the movement of tm6 , the outward movement of the cytoplasmic half of tm7 was observed in the 13 - cisr - e122deltap - e129p simulation ( fig 6b and 6d ) .
to visualize the correlated motions of tm6 and tm7 , we calculated the correlation coefficient between each calpha atom in the tm domains .
the correlation matrix showed that the cytoplasmic halves of tm6 and tm7 have a strong correlation , with a coefficient greater than 0.7 ( fig 7 ; black dashed circle in panel a ) .
moreover , in this correlation matrix , we found that the cytoplasmic half of tm2 has a negative correlation coefficient with tm7 ( fig 7a ; red dashed circle ) , indicating that the cytoplasmic halves of tm2 and tm7 move in opposite directions ( fig 6b and 6e ) .
these movements of tm2 and tm7 facilitate the disruption of the salt bridge between glu121 and arg307 in the intracellular constriction ( fig 6f ) .
taken together , the results of the 13 - cisr - e122deltap - e129p simulation suggested that retinal isomerization induces the series of conformational changes of trp262 , followed by those of tm6 , tm7 , and tm2 , toward channel opening .
this is consistent with previous results obtained by cryo - electron microscopy and deer spectroscopy , which suggested the movements of tm2 , 6 and 7 in chr2 during the photocycle , based on projection difference maps [ 41 - 43 ] .

( a ) the matrix of correlation coefficients for the pairs of calpha atoms .
( b ) mapping of the correlation coefficients to the structure .
the black dashed circle represents the pair of calpha atoms with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 .
the red dashed circle represents the pair of calpha atoms in tm2 and tm7 that has a negative correlation coefficient .
our 13 - cisr - 122deltap - 129p simulation results suggested that the isomerization of retinal induces the conformational change of trp262 , which is followed by the subsequent movements of tm6 , tm7 and tm2 ( figs 5 and 6 ) .
given that the p1 500 state in the photocycle is observed ~ 50 ns after the retinal isomerization [ 8,10 ] and that large conformational changes of the protein backbone were observed in this p1 500 state by ftir spectroscopy [ 8,44 ] , the structural changes , including the movements of tm6 , tm7 and tm2 , observed in the 13 - cisr - 122deltap - 129p simulation are likely to represent the structural transition from the ground state to the p1 500 state .
moreover , this p1 500 state is considered to be a non - conducting state [ 7 - 12 ] , which is consistent with the observations in this simulation : the channel pore radii on both the cytoplasmic and extracellular sides were still comparable to those of the atr - 122deltap - 129p simulation , and thus too narrow to permeate monovalent or divalent cations .
the events that occur after retinal isomerization ( i.e. , p1 500 ) involve the proton transfer between the schiff base of the retinal and the surrounding protein side chains , which finally results in the ion - conducting state .
an investigation of the subsequent events is beyond the scope of the present study , since the time scales on which those events occur are several tens of micro - seconds to milli - seconds [ 8,10,44 ] , and thus exceed the current limitations of our computational resources .
nevertheless , the present study provides mechanistic insights into the nature of the two constrictions and the early response of the protein conformations to the isomerization of the retinal chromophore , and will serve as a framework for future investigations of the formation of the ion - conducting state .

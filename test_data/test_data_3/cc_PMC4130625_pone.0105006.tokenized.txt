background acute decompression illness ( dci ) involving the brain ( cerebral dci ) is one of the most serious forms of diving - related injuries which may leave residual brain damage .
cerebral dci occurs in compressed air and in breath - hold divers , likewise .
we conducted this study to investigate whether long - term breath - hold divers who may be exposed to repeated symptomatic and asymptomatic brain injuries , show brain damage on magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
subjects and methods our study subjects were 12 commercial breath - hold divers ( ama ) with long histories of diving work in a district of japan .
we obtained information on their diving practices and the presence or absence of medical problems , especially dci events .
all participants were examined with mri to determine the prevalence of brain lesions .
results out of 12 ama divers ( mean age : 54.9 +/ - 5.1 years ) , four had histories of cerebral dci events , and 11 divers demonstrated ischemic lesions of the brain on mri studies .
the lesions were situated in the cortical and / or subcortical area ( 9 cases ) , white matters ( 4 cases ) , the basal ganglia ( 4 cases ) , and the thalamus ( 1 case ) .
subdural fluid collections were seen in 2 cases .
conclusion these results suggest that commercial breath - hold divers are at a risk of clinical or subclinical brain injury which may affect the long - term neuropsychological health of divers .

background decompression illness ( dci ) , which includes bubble disease from decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism is well known in compressed - air divers .
the common symptoms are join and / or muscle pain , numbness , or paresthesia , whereas stroke - like syndromes are uncommon [ 1 ] .
in contrast , the occurrence of dci in breath - hold diving is considered extremely rare [ 2 ] .
however , several cases of dci have been reported in professional and sport breath - hold divers [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
our survey of commercial breath - hold divers ( ama ) in japan have shown that repetitive , working breath - hold dives can induce neurological dci .
based on the reported symptoms and neuro - radiological findings , brain lesions were particularly prominent in this group [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
numerous studies have been conducted in an attempt to evaluate the long - term neuropsychological consequences of professional and recreational compressed air diving .
it was shown that incidence of brain lesions increases with diving experience , suggesting that diving could have a cumulative effect on the brain even without a history of symptomatic injuries [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
moreover , similar concerns regarding subclinical cerebral lesions without a history of symptomatic dci have emerged recently in compressed air divers [ 11 ] .
on the other hand , breath - hold divers with a known history of stroke - like post - dive symptoms have not been studied using neuro - radiological methods [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , so far .
the purpose of the present study was , therefore , to assess the prevalence of brain injury in japanese ama divers , using by brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
subjects and methods twelve male ama divers from two villages on the archipelagos aishima and ohshima , members of the diving union of abu - hagi district of yamaguchi prefecture , japan , participated in the study .
in one village there were 13 partially assisted ama divers and six volunteered for the study .
in the other village there were six partially assisted ama divers and all six participated in the study .
no specific medical selection criterion was applied .
the ama diving union includes 14 villages of divers on archipelagos and on the coast of the main island .
in april 2009 , there were 346 male and 35 female divers ; 39 of them were assisted and were all male [ 8 ] .
their age ranges from their teens to 80 s. unassisted ama divers generally dive to depths of 3 - 6 meters without any aids .
assisted divers use weights for descents and are either pulled up by assistants ( completely assisted ) or swim up without assistance ( partially assisted ) .
the assisted divers work deep , occasionally over 20 meters [ 11 ] .
in the present study all participants were partially assisted ama divers .
all assisted and unassisted ama divers engage in daily diving work during harvest season ( from december 21 to october 20 ) ; monday through thursday .
in accordance with their regulations , diving starts at 09:00 and stops at 15:00 .
they wear wetsuits and fins and carry a weight belt to achieve neutral buoyancy .
they work two shifts a day with a lunch break of about 30 minutes in between .
the duration of the morning shift was three to four hours and that of the afternoon shift was one to three hours .
they descend about 30 times per hour to depths of 10 - 20 meters [ 12 ] .
their working dive pattern has not been changed for a few decades .
the study protocol was approved by the human research ethics committee of kurume university school of medicine , japan .
the subjects participated voluntarily and gave their written informed consent .
in 2011 a standard interview was carried out by a physician ( h.t. ) , focusing on a diving history including possible diving - related symptoms and neurological findings such as joint pain , skin rash , nausea , dizziness / vertigo , motor and / or sensory involvement , visual deficit , and unconsciousness .
diving accidents were defined as event with symptom onset within 24 hours after dive [ 1 ] .
a separate questionnaire for the divers included questions on their smoking habit , alcohol consumption , and the presence of hypertension , cardiac disease , diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular diseases .
the participants were enrolled into the brain mri study beginning in 2011 using the following criteria : 1 ) partially assisted ama divers , 2 ) no contraindications to mri , and 3 ) signed informed consent .
we made axial brain images ( t1 : tr / se 220 / 400 msec , t2 : tr / se 220 / 4000 msec , slice thickness 9 mm ) on a 0.2 tesla mri scanner ( airis mate , hitachi , japan ) at tamaki hospital , hagi city , yamaguchi prefecture in japan .
we defined chronic cerebral infarcts as areas of focal hyperintensity on t2 - weighted images that were at least 3 mm in diameter .
areas of hyperintensity also had to have corresponding prominent hypointensity on t1 - weighted images .
in addition , white - matter lesions were considered present if they were shown as hyperintense on t2 - weighted images , without prominent hypointensity on t1 - weighted scans .
however , lesions in the supraventricular and paraventricular white matter were distinguished .
mr films were reviewed jointly and without blinding , in conference by a neuro - radiologist ( t.o. ) and a neurosurgeon ( k.k. ) .
results significant findings obtained from the participants are shown in table 1 . the details of diving exposure were as follows ; total ama diving experience of 29.8 +/ - 7.6 years ( range : 17 - 40 years ) and partially assisted ama experience of 26.3 +/ - 10.1 years ( range : 9 - 40 years ) .
seven of 12 ama divers began to work as unassisted divers in shallow water , and then graduated to become partially assisted divers .
other divers started as assisted ama divers from their begging .
the divers carried a weight belt of 5 +/ - 1.5 kg ( range : 1 - 7 kg ) to maintain neutral buoyancy , and assisted ama divers descended passively using a weight of 20.4 +/ - 1.5 kg ( range : 18 - 24 kg ) and swam to the surface without assistance .

four of 12 ama divers had experienced stroke - like neurological events during or immediately after multiple breath - hold dives ; their symptoms were attributable to brain insults and all of them were transient and resolved completely within a few hours ( no. 4 , 7 , 11 , 12 ) ( table - 1 ) .
the time intervals between the last neurological events and the mri study were more than several years in these divers .
two divers had history of two decompression neurological accidents .
one of them ( no. 4 ) had experienced speech disturbance and motor weakness on right side after 3 - 4 hours repetitive dives , and the symptoms disappeared spontaneously within 1 hour after the accident .
moreover , his former event included transient hemiparesis involving facial paresis around 10 years before .
the medical histories included diabetes mellitus in two , and angina in one diver .
eleven of 12 ama divers displayed mri abnormalities of the brain ( table - 1 ) .
all ischemic lesions were supratentorial , predominantly in the cortex and / or subcortex ( 9 cases ) , central white matter ( 4 cases ) , basal ganglia ( 4 cases ) , and thalamus ( 1 case ) .
there were two lesions close to the lateral ventricles in one diver , which would show infarcts in the caudate nucleus , not primary demyelinating disorders .
in addition , questionable areas on mri suggesting cortical infarcts or subacute stage of infarction were seen in five cases ( no. 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) .
other brain lesions were subdural effusion in two ( no .
11 , 12 ) , and lateral ventricle enlargement caused by white matter infarction in one diver ( no. 11 ) .
figure 1 shows examples of mri from three divers who were found to have brain lesions .
two divers had no history of neurological dci events ( fig. 1a & b , no .
2 & 5 ) and the other one had transient left - sided hemiparesis after multiple dives for several hours ( fig. 1c , no. 11 ) .

discussion to our knowledge , the present study is the only series in the literature to report the results of brain mri in commercial breath - hold divers .
in our small series of 12 ama divers , all the participants except for one diver had multiple cerebral infarcts , while they were neurologically normal and healthy divers though four of them had a history of transient stroke - like attacks .
although the used type of low - field mr imager , a popular system at local hospitals in japan , might have some limitations , its diagnostic quality in detecting cerebral lesions is not different than that of high - field mri [ 13 ] .
these results suggest that long - term breath - hold diving increases a risk for brain damage even in the absence of neurological dci events .
a variety of neuro - radiological studies performed with brain mri comparing populations of compressed - air divers with non - diving control groups has given conflicting results [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
gas bubbles formed in the venous blood after diving , can cross from venous side to the arterial side of the circulation ( arterialization ) in the presence of intracardiac right - to - left shunts ( rlss ) .
arterialized gas emboli have been considered one of the main causes of decompression - related pathology .
recently , gempp et al. demonstrated that the proportion of hyperintense spots in compressed - air divers was closely related to the presence of a large rls [ 16 ] , as suggested by knauth et al [ 17 ] .
the presence of rlss in divers is an important risk factor in cerebral dci events .
however , a few reported ama cases showed no rlss even though they had large cerebral infarcts [ 5 ] , [ 18 ] .
a prevalence rate of rlss is 10 - 30 % in healthy adults [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
local hyperintense areas of the brain observed with mri are common in healthy subjects , and the prevalence increases with older age and occurs in 10 - 20 % of people aged around 60 years [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
the high prevalence of cerebral ischemic lesions that we found in ama divers cannot be explained by rlss and aging togather .
based on the reported cases and series , neurological dci in breath - hold diving appears to exist as a clinical entity [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
a survey for 173 ama divers in a district of japan showed that 12 divers had histories of acute neurological events .
eleven of 29 assisted and only one of 144 unassisted ama divers had an event .
the events were significantly correlated with a severity of dive exposure , i.e. dive depth , dive time , and surface interval [ 8 ] .
unlike in compressed air diving , in multiple deep breath - hold diving the cerebral insults appear to be common .
the neurological dci in breath - hold divers is limited to the brain [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , while sparing the spinal cord , which , in contrast , occur more frequently in compressed - air divers .
typically , the cerebral dci manifests with sensory numbness or motor weakness on one side .
another characteristic of dci in breath - hold divers is that many divers exhibited transient neurological deficits that resolve within several hours , even without treatments [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
the cerebral ischemic lesions in ama divers were predominantly located in the cortex and subcortical white matter ; suggested features of circulatory disturbance at the corticomedullary junctional area of cerebral arteries .
other lesions in the basal ganglia were situated in the terminal zone , and the lesions involving central white matter corresponded to border zone or watershed areas .
these mri findings in ama divers are so - called low - flow cerebral infarction as a result of low perfusion pressure in terminal supply areas and in agreement with those in compressed - air divers [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
in general , the main clinical features of infarction in these areas of the brain are transient ischemic attacks or mild , even though the underlaying lesions appear considerably large on ct or mri [ 26 ] .
cerebral arterial gas embolization typically involves the migration of gas to small arteries ( average diameter , 30 to 60 micron ) in terminal supply areas [ 27 ] , and the size of lesions is mainly influenced by numbers of gas emboli and the clinical course would be dependent on the locations of cerebral lesions .
the potential mechanisms of brain involvement following multiple breath - hold dives are still unclear .
in compressed - air diving , nitrogen ( n2 ) dissolves and accumulates in tissues , particularly in fat tissues .
due to possible n2 accumulation after multiple dives with short surface intervals , n2 bubbles are formed in the venous side of tissues rather than the brain .
although the bubble formation has been controversial in breath - hold diving , our recent study on the same 12 participants showed signs of intravascular bubbles using doppler ultrasound after continuous diving for 3 hours in one diver [ 12 ] .
moreover , matsuo et al. reported a case of an ama diver with an early stage of acute neurological dci whose brain ct scan demonstrated an air density in the cortical area , explanatory for his symptoms [ 18 ] .
these results suggest that multiple breath - hold dives are sufficient to cause n2 retention in divers and produce intravasucular bubbles .
although a strong correlation between high levels of intravascular bubbles and the risk of dci is well known in compressed air diving [ 28 ] , cerebral insults are rare compared to spinal disorders .
in contrast , the neurological dci events in breath - hold divers seem to be due to brain involvement alone despite the difficulty of detecting venous bubbles .
the discrepancy between presence of symptoms of cerebral dci in absence of strong evidence of intravascular bubbles in breath - hold diving has not been resolved , and reviews of the published images suggest that several mechanisms may be at play .
all venous bubbles except for micro - bubbles after multiple breath - hold dives are retained or trapped in the small pulmonary arteries .
when breath - hold divers descend to the bottom , the trapped bubbles are compressed and decreased enough to pass through the pulmonary capillaries into arterial circulation .
the arterialized bubbles expand during ascent , and then cause a small - vessel disease of the brain .
while some other mechanisms have been also discussed , in our opinion , cerebral dci cases in breath - hold divers may be explained by arterial gas embolism as the main mechanism .
while the exact clinical significance of hyperintense lesions is uncertain at this time , their presence is generally considered an intermediate marker for risks of disturbed neuro - psychological performance .
considerable research has been performed to evaluate the potential long - term effects of diving - related dcs on mental health in breath - hold divers .
in conclusion , our results suggest that long - term commercial breath - hold diving can cause brain damages even if neurological dci events were transient or have not occurred in divers .

background the genus flavivirus comprises several mosquito - borne species , including the zoonotic pathogens west nile and usutu virus , circulating in animals and humans in italy since 1998 .
due to its ecological and geographical features , piedmont is considered a risk area for flavivirus transmission .
here we report the results of a flavivirus survey ( detection and genetic characterization ) of mosquitoes collected in piedmont in 2012 and the genetic characterization of three strains detected in 2011 .
methods pools of 1 - 203 mosquitoes , upon rna extraction with trizol , were screened by a pcr assay for a 263 bp fragment of the flavivirus ns5 gene .
all positive samples were tested with a specific pcr for the e protein gene of usutu virus and a generic flavivirus rt - nested - pcr for a larger tract of the ns5 gene before sequencing .
phylogenetic trees were built with both ns5 fragments of representative flavivirus species .
dna extracts of part of the positive pools were tested to detect sequences integrated in the host genome .
results thirty - four mosquito pools resulted positive for flaviviruses , and twenty - five flavivirus sequences underwent phylogenetic analysis for the short ns5 fragment .
among the 19 sequences correlating with the insect - specific flavivirus group , ten samples , retrieved from aedes albopictus , clustered within aedes flavivirus , while the other nine aggregated in a separate clade composed of strains from various mosquito species ( mainly aedes vexans ) from piedmont and the czech republic .
six out of these nine also presented a dna form of the sequence .
the remaining sequences belonged to the mosquito - borne group : four , all from culex pipiens , correlated to italian usutu virus strains , whereas two , from ochlerotatus caspius , were highly similar to marisma mosquito virus ( mmv ) .
conclusions our findings confirm the circulation of usutu virus and of the potentially zoonotic marisma mosquito virus in piedmont .
this is the first detection of aedes flavivirus in piedmont .
finally , further evidence for the integration of flavivirus nucleic acid into the host genome has been shown .
these results underline the importance of continuing intense mosquito - based surveillance in piedmont , supported by a mosquito control program in areas at high risk for human exposure .
keywords insect - specific flavivirus marisma mosquito virus mosquito surveillance usutu virus issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background the genus flavivirus , within the family flaviviridae , comprises enveloped , single - stranded rna viruses [ 1 ] , most of which are arthropod - borne viruses ( arboviruses ) ; it is considered a significant cause of emerging diseases in humans and animals worldwide [ 2 ] .
transmitted mainly by mosquitoes and ticks , flaviviruses are able to infect a wide range of hosts , including mammals and birds .
the genus includes several major zoonotic pathogens responsible for viral haemorrhagic fevers ( i.e. , yellow fever virus and dengue virus ) , arboviral encephalitis such as the tick - borne encephalitis virus , and the japanese encephalitis group , including west nile virus ( wnv ) , usutu virus ( usuv ) , and st. louis encephalitis virus [ 3 ] .
supported by phylogenetic analysis of genome sequences [ 4 , 5 ] , flavivirus species have been grouped according to their antigenic properties and vector associations [ 6 ] into mosquito - borne ( mbv ) , tick - borne ( tbv ) , and no - known vector viruses ( nkv ) , as described by kuno and colleagues [ 4 ] .
isolation of novel unclassified flaviviruses from different mosquito species revealed the existence of a novel group diverging from the other known flaviviruses , named insect - specific flavivirus ( isf ) [ 7 ] .
the first described was the cell fusing agent virus isolated on a mosquito cell culture [ 8 ] .
to date , the isf group includes several members , including the kamiti river virus isolated in kenya in 1999 [ 9 , 10 ] , culex flavivirus first isolated from culex mosquitoes in japan and indonesia in 2003 - 2004 [ 11 ] , and aedes flavivirus ( aefv ) found in aedes albopictus in japan in 2003 - 2004 [ 12 ] .
in europe , the first isf isolation was reported in spain from cx. spp. and ochlerotatus caspius collected in 2006 [ 13 ] , although genomic sequences had already been detected in oc caspius , aedes vexans , and ae. albopictus in italy [ 14 , 15 ] , portugal [ 16 ] , and spain [ 17 , 18 ] .
flavivirus - like sequences integrated in the genome of mosquitoes have been identified in different species of field - collected mosquitoes [ 14 , 19 ] .
the integration of nucleic acid from non - retroviral rna viruses by eukaryotic cells is a potential evolutionary mechanism that has not been unravelled so far [ 16 , 19 ] .
the mbv group includes several human pathogens ( dengue , yellow fever , wnv , usuv ) able to replicate in vertebrate cells .
recently , novel species like nounane and tai forest virus in cote d'ivoire [ 20 ] , lammi virus in finland [ 1 ] , and marisma mosquito virus ( mmv ) in spain [ 13 ] , detected in field mosquitoes and isolated only on insect cells , were included in the mbv group upon their genetic characterization .
as reported in the literature , mmv successfully grew on c6 / 36 cell lines , whereas its growth on vertebrate lines ( vero and bhk - 21 ) was supported only for the first passage , thus suggesting that mmv is only able to infect insect cells [ 13 ] .
during the last decades , several arboviral outbreaks in both animals and humans in europe have mainly been caused by emerging pathogens [ 21 - 25 ] , resulting in the establishment of wnv and usuv through a local transmission cycle sustained by vectors and resident bird host populations .
italy has been the scene of several mosquito - borne epidemics : wnv , first detected in 1998 in horses [ 26 ] , more recently caused neuroinvasive disease in humans in 2008 - 2013 [ 27 - 29 ] ; chikungunya virus ( an alphavirus of the family togaviridae ) was identified in ae. albopictus mosquitoes and in humans in 2007 [ 30 , 31 ] ; usutu virus was associated with the first case of human infection with neurological involvement in 2009 [ 32 , 33 ] .
a recent retrospective analysis detected usuv rna in tissue samples archived in 1996 during an episode of unusual wild bird mortality in tuscany ( italy ) .
partial sequencing confirmed identity with the 2001 vienna usuv strain and all its descendants , providing evidence for a much earlier introduction of the virus into europe than previously assumed [ 34 ] .
the risk factors for flavivirus transmission in northwestern italy ( piedmont region ) include : an abundance of migratory / resident avifauna and mosquito species ( e.g. , aedes spp. and culex spp. ) , vectors competent for arbovirus transmission [ 35 ] , and geographical features ( alps , rivers , lakes , extensive rice fields ) .
preliminary evidence for usuv and flavivirus infection in mosquitoes in piedmont and bordering regions [ 15 , 36 ] prompted the establishment of a monitoring program in 2011 based on the integrated serological and virological surveillance of reservoir birds , horses and mosquitoes .
during the first year of monitoring , wnv and usuv antibodies were detected in horses [ 37 ] , and flavivirus rna ( including usuv ) was found at a very low prevalence in mosquitoes , but no further molecular characterization was performed [ 38 ] .
here , we present the results of virological surveillance , in terms of flavivirus presence and prevalence , carried out on mosquitoes in piedmont during the summer of 2012 .
in order to gain better insight into the evolutionary relationship of circulating mosquito flavivirus species , molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis were performed on the strains detected in 2011 and 2012 .
methods survey area and mosquito collection piedmont , in northwestern italy , is divided into eight provinces ( total area , 25,401.56 km2 ; population , 4,457,335 inhabitants ) .
it is located at the western end of the po plain and is surrounded by the alps on three sides ( figure 1 ) .
it is crossed by the po river and bounded to the east by the ticino river ; it borders two other regions , lombardy and emilia - romagna , with established and documented flavivirus circulation .
based on previous studies , which reported flavivirus circulation in mosquitoes in late summer [ 15 , 36 , 38 ] , the virological surveillance started on august 1st and sampling was performed every two weeks till october 12th , 2012 .
the number of co2 - baited traps selected in 2012 for flavivirus surveillance was increased to 32 ( i.e. , 17 more than in the previous year ) in order to extend coverage of the region .
the traps were placed in locations at high risk for the establishment of the vector - host flavivirus transmission cycle , according to risk - based factors such as proximity to wet areas ( rice fields , po and ticino rivers ) , airports , farms with previous wnv seropositivity in horses , and an abundance of migratory and resident avifauna .

the map indicates the trap sites for the virological surveillance .
province borders are defined and indicated as to : torino , cn : cuneo , at : asti , al : alessandria , vc : vercelli , no : novara , bi : biella , vco : verbano - cusio - ossola .
the 32 virological traps are colour - coded according to the results of flavivirus detection : black for negative traps , red for mmv - positive traps , yellow for isf - positive traps , green for usuv - positive traps .
species identification was based on morphological characteristics by means of standard classification keys [ 39 , 40 ] .
mosquitoes were maintained under cold chain conditions to preserve virus viability in the samples , pooled in a maximum of 203 specimens according to date , trap location and species , and stored at - 80degreesc .
each pool was ground in 2 ml of pbs plus two 4.5 mm copper beads in a tissuelyser ( qiagen ) ; the homogenates were clarified by centrifugation , and 200 mul of each supernatant were collected and stored in trizol ( r ) ( sigma - aldrich ) at - 80degreesc until processing .
virus identification rna extraction was performed with 600 mul of trizol ( r ) ( sigma - aldrich ) with a final elution in 50 mul of dnase - rnase - free water .
a two - step amplification was set up with the reverse transcription ( rt ) step performed using the high - capacity cdna reverse transcription kit ( life technologies ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
in order to detect both generic flavivirus and specific west nile virus infection , cdna was simultaneously amplified with an end - point pcr assay for the flavivirus genus , targeting a 263 bp fragment of the ns5 protein gene [ 41 ] and with a real - time pcr assay , targeting a conserved 92 bp fragment of the 3 ' noncoding region of wnv [ 42 ] .
the latter was modified from the original one - step protocol by performing the pcr step after cdna synthesis .
positive and doubtful samples to the flavivirus pcr were further processed for usuv rna search using an end - point pcr assay targeting a fragment of 425 bp of the e protein gene [ 43 ] .
to better characterize these strains , all the positive pools underwent a further generic ns5 rt - nested pcr , targeting a 980 bp region of the ns5 protein gene , according to [ 13 ] , but reducing the annealing time to 1 ' in both the first and second reactions .
pcr products were visualized by gelgreen nucleic acid gel stain ( biotium ) staining after electrophoresis on 1.5 % high resolution agarose gel w / v , and bands of the expected size were excised from the gel and processed for sequencing .
dna extraction and amplification rna / dna extraction was performed on 15 pools resulting as isf after sequencing of the short ns5 amplicon .
the nucleospin ( r ) rna ii kit ( macherey - nagel ) allows parallel purification of genomic dna in a separate tube with the nucleospin ( r ) rna / dna buffer set , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
a volume of 50 mul of each dna extract was then digested with rnase a ( qiagen ) , incubated at 56degreesc for 10 ' and purified on silica columns ( qiagen ) , washed twice with aw1 and aw2 buffers , and eluted in a final volume of 50 mul of rnase - dnase - free water .
each rnase - treated dna extract was directly amplified with the end - point pcr assay for the flavivirus genus [ 41 ] and amplicons were visualized on 1.5 % high resolution agarose gel w / v. calculation of infection rates minimum infection rate ( mir ) and maximum likelihood estimate ( mle ) values were calculated for each positive species using excel add - in pooledinfrate v3.0 [ 44 ] and expressed as the number of infected mosquitoes per 1,000 tested .
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis three sequences ( two mmv from oc. caspius and one usuv from cx. pipiens ) , obtained during the 2011 surveillance program , were included in the phylogenetic analysis .
in order to characterize the detected virus , pcr products were sequenced on an automated fluorescence - based abi prism 3130 genetic analyzer ( life technologies ) .
the obtained sequences were hand - edited using bioedit software v7.0.5 ; contigs were then generated with seqman ii 5.00 software ( dnastar ) .
the sequence identity with available genbank sequences was computed using the r statistical environment v2.15.2 and the ape package v3.0 - 8 [ 45 , 46 ] and expressed as proportional nucleotide identity .
among all the short ns5 obtained sequences , only high - quality sequences of at least 200 bp were considered for phylogenetic reconstruction and submitted to genbank .
multiple sequence alignment was composed of 90 sequences ( 25 from the present study and 65 reference sequences available on genbank ) for a total of 214 sites and was performed using muscle software v3.8.31 [ 47 ] supported by seaview v4.4.0 [ 48 ] .
a multiple alignment on 937 sites of the long ns5 fragment , including 20 new sequences and 34 reference sequences retrieved from genbank , was built using clustal omega v1.1.0 [ 49 ] .
to improve the reliability of phylogeny reconstruction in both cases , the best molecular substitution model was selected by jmodeltest2 [ 50 , 51 ] from among the three substitution schemes , considering unequal nucleotide frequency ( f ) , gamma distribution of variation across sites with four categories ( g ) , and proportion of invariant sites ( i ) for a total of 24 tested models , and the best of nni and spr for tree search .
the best model was selected by the akaike information criterion ( aic ) .
the phylogenetic trees were built under the bayesian framework implemented in mrbayes v3.2.1 , using the jmodeltest2 output to set the prior nucleotide substitution model [ 52 , 53 ] .
the other parameters were estimated under default priors , with two runs of four chains each running for 50,000,000 generations .
to evaluate the run quality , the convergence of the two runs was verified based on the summary of parameter values , discarding the first 20 % of samples as burn - in ( sump command implemented in mrbayes ) , and on tracer analysis of mcmc traces .
the estimated sample size of the likelihood parameter for both tree reconstructions was well over 200 , the threshold for significance .
mrbayes analyses were performed on the cipres science gateway server [ 54 ] .
results mosquito collection from august 1st to october 12th , 8533 specimens , belonging to nine mosquito species , were collected from the 32 co2 - baited traps selected for analysis in the survey area ( figure 1 ) , as summarized in table 1 .
nineteen traps collected positive mosquitoes , with ten traps collecting positive individuals in more than one session ( table 2 ) .

virus identification a total of 315 pools underwent molecular investigations ; 34 pools , representing five mosquito species , tested positive on pcr screening for the flavivirus genus , targeting the short ns5 fragment : 14 from ae. albopictus , 12 from ae. vexans , 4 from cx. pipiens , 3 from oc. caspius , and 1 from oc. geniculatus .
the prevalence of the detected viruses in each positive mosquito species was evaluated according to the minimum infection rate ( mir ) and maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) , as summarized in table 1 .
the 34 deduced ns5 gene sequences , following a blast search , identified 28 insect - specific flaviviruses ( belonging to different species ) , 4 usuv , and 2 mmv strains ( table 2 ) .
no positivity for wnv was found .
seventeen out of 34 pools resulted positive also to the long ns5 rt - nested pcr , whereas 15 pools were negative .
two samples had insufficient rna to perform the analysis .
dna extraction and amplification twelve out of 15 isf pools , the same ones that resulted negative to the long ns5 assay , underwent dna extraction with the rnase treatment and subsequent amplification for the short ns5 fragment .
three pools had insufficient material to perform dna extraction and amplification .
all the tested pools resulted positive to the ns5 short pcr ( table 2 ) .
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis the 28 insect - specific flavivirus short sequences were retrieved from mosquito pools belonging to four species ( ae. vexans , oc. geniculatus , oc. caspius , and ae. albopictus ) .
thirteen sequences were similar to aedes flavivirus , while 15 showed a high similarity to uncharacterized flavivirus sequences ( blastn search , data not shown ) .
after manual checking to ensure high quality , 19 sequences were selected for phylogeny reconstruction of the flavivirus genus based on the short ns5 sequence .
in this phylogenetic tree , the clade of aedes flavivirus , within which 10 samples from ae. albopictus clustered , was fully supported by the posterior probability of the common ancestral node .
the other nine sequences , all retrieved from ae. vexans , aggregated in a significantly separate clade composed of isf sequences from different mosquito species collected in piedmont and the czech republic ( genbank : jn802279 , jn802281 - 83 ) .
notably , in five out of nine sequences , the repeat of a 4 bp motif ( ttat ) at nucleotide position 9178 ( referred to yellow fever reference strain nc _ 002031 ) generated a + 1 frameshift , leading to a stop codon correspondent to amino acid at position 66 in the sequences .
the same stop codon was present in the sequence aeve 79 ( genbank : jn802283 ) from the czech republic .
all these sequences clustered very closely on the phylogenetic tree .
the five usuv - positive pools were composed of cx. pipiens individuals , all collected in novara province .
in 2012 , three pools were sampled on august 22nd ( two of which from the same trap in the city of novara ) , while in the following session ( september 5th ) a positive pool was collected in a different location 5 km away from the first ones .
the only usuv - positive pool detected in 2011 came from cameri in novara province .
positivity was confirmed by usuv - specific pcr assay targeting a portion of the envelope protein ( env ) gene .
the partial env sequences ( genbank : kf801585 - 88 and kf882515 ) , almost identical to each other , resulted 99 % similar to sequences retrieved from cx. pipiens in piedmont in 2009 ( genbank : jn257983 ) and 2010 ( genbank : jn257982 ) , as well as to a sequence retrieved from blackbirds in vienna in 2001 ( genbank : ay453411 ) .
however , the similarity decreased to 96 % when compared to the saar 1776 strain isolated from mosquitoes in south africa in 1958 ( genbank : ay453412 ) .
in the phylogenetic trees of the flavivirus genus , the five usuv strains clustered together with italian strains previously found in piedmont and bordering regions ( figures 2 and 3 ) .
figure 2 phylogenetic tree based on the short ns5 fragment of the flavivirus genus .
a fragment of 214 bp of the ns5 gene was used to infer the tree .
the phylogenetic analysis includes 62 reference sequences from genbank , 3 sequences from the 2011 surveillance program , and 25 from the present study ( 19 isf , 4 usuv , 2 mmv ) .
unpublished sequences are given in bold , piedmont sequences in italics .
the nucleotide substitution model used as a prior for the mcmc was gtr + g , according to the jmodeltest2 results .
the tree is mid - point routed ; for clarity , only posterior probability of the nodes > 0.7 is reported in the figure for statistical support .
the scale of branch length is expressed as substitution per site .
taxa are divided into four clusters according to the literature : is insect - specific ; nk no - known vector ; mb mosquito - borne ; tb tick - borne .
figure 3 phylogenetic tree based on the long ns5 fragment of the flavivirus genus .
a fragment of 937 bp of the ns5 gene was used to infer the tree .
the phylogenetic analysis includes 35 reference sequences from genbank and 20 from this study .
unpublished sequences are given in bold , piedmont sequences in italics .
the nucleotide substitution model used as a prior for the mcmc was gtr + i + g according to the jmodeltest2 results .
the tree is mid - point routed , and the scale of branch length is expressed as substitution per site .
taxa are divided into four clusters , according to the literature : is insect - specific ; nk no - known vector ; mb mosquito - borne ; tb tick - borne .
four partial ns5 sequences , two collected in 2011 ( genbank : kf882512 - 13 ) and two in 2012 ( genbank : kf801593 and kf801598 ) , all from oc. caspius pools from alessandria province , showed high similarity to an italian flavivirus sequence from oc. caspius ( flavivirus aedes / mo - ac / ita / 2009 , genbank : hq441866 ) and to the spanish mmv isolate ( genbank : jn603190 ) .
our sequences , 99.5 % identical to each other , revealed a 96.5 - 97 % nucleotide identity when compared to hq441866 and 92 - 93 % to mmv .
phylogenetic analysis of the short fragment confirmed that the four mmv sequences were closely related to the italian strain and less related to the mmv from spain ( figure 2 ) , as strongly supported by the posterior probability of the internal node .
to improve genetic characterization and to obtain more information on the relationship of the detected viruses , the long sequences were compared with 34 others from among the most representative flavivirus species in genbank ( figure 3 ) .
the sequences from the aedes flavivirus species were highly conserved among each other .
in the usuv clade , a correlation was observed between collection time and evolutionary trend , although the time factor was not considered in the phylogenetic inference .
the piedmont mmv strain , as in the first tree , lay on a clade separate from the spanish one , although both were very close to each other .
discussion during the 2012 mosquito survey , we detected 34 positivities , whose nucleotide sequences belong to the flavivirus genus , of which 25 short ns5 sequences were submitted to genbank and used for a first phylogenetic inference .
in addition , we performed genetic characterization of one usuv strain and two mmv strains detected during the 2011 surveillance program .
extending the number of traps placed throughout the whole region allowed us to concentrate our efforts within a narrower time span , demonstrating that by increasing the number of sampling stations per province we were able to obtain a higher detection rate for each province , without drastically increasing the number of captures .
positivity to the same viral strain in more than one sampling session and in the same mosquito species suggests the establishment of species - specific flavivirus transmission in a particular geographic area .
our phylogenetic analyses , based on both short and long multiple alignments , agree with previous characterization studies on arboviruses from field - collected mosquitoes [ 4 , 15 , 36 ] .
these results confirmed the circulation of aedes flavivirus in italy , with the first detection in piedmont .
interestingly , analysis of the other isf , so far found only in italy [ 36 ] and the czech republic , revealed that they are indeed sequences of flavivirus origin integrated into the genomic dna of at least four mosquito species belonging to two genera , aedes and ochlerotatus .
these samples tested positive when their dna was amplified .
moreover , the long ns5 pcr unsuccessfully amplified their cdna , supporting the hypothesis for their integration .
furthermore , a non functional stop codon at the 3 ' end of the ns5 fragment was observed as the result of repetition of a ttat motif in five ae. vexans strains from piedmont and in that from the czech republic .
this mutation corroborates the integration hypothesis , since the mosquito may not need a functional rna - dependent rna polymerase ( coded by the ns5 gene ) ; alternatively , it may contribute to immunity to infections by other flavivirus species through the mechanism of rna interference [ 55 , 56 ] .
in the past , the genus ochlerotatus was classified as a subgenus of the composite genus aedes until it was elevated to the generic rank [ 57 ] .
the finding of an ns5 sequence integrated in the dna of these two genera suggests that it might be an ancestral virus that integrated before speciation of these mosquitoes .
nevertheless , as reported by crochu and colleagues [ 19 ] , the split between some aedes species occurred much earlier than the estimated origin of the most recent common ancestor of isf .
however , since the two genera are closely related , they may have shared infectious agents in the recent past , and the integration may have occurred in these hosts at different times .
indeed , cook and colleagues [ 58 ] proposed that isf have experienced multiple introductions with several host - switching events during their evolution .
as our sample set was analysed from a surveillance point of view , no further research was performed to investigate this phenomenon .
an interesting result is given by usuv : in both 2011 and 2012 the positive cx. pipiens pools were collected in a small area ( 10 km2 ) in novara province , and some pools from the same trap were confirmed positive in both years .
the area is in very close proximity to the ticino river natural park , a wet area of 62.5 km2 and an important wintering site for wild waterfowl .
at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels , the piedmont usuv sequences have shown only minimal substitutions since 2009 , but , based on the long fragment phylogeny , it appears that this virus has slowly evolved over time since its first appearance in europe .
according to recent investigations providing evidence that the first usuv pathogenic outbreak in wild birds dates back to 1996 in tuscany ( italy ) , a single introduction event occurred not in austria in 2001 , as was generally assumed , but in italy as the starting point of the spread of usuv in europe .
this scenario is strengthened by the fact that local herd immunity in italian wild birds prevented further bird deaths and supported silent spread of the virus in naive areas .
indeed , large - scale wild bird deaths , as reported for austria , switzerland , and germany [ 22 , 25 , 59 ] , were not observed in italy , despite widespread viral activity [ 43 , 60 ]. with regard to a previous report [ 38 ] , detection of mmv was confirmed one year later during the same period ( august ) and in the same trap , and also detected at a second site 20 km away .
their molecular characterization based on the long ns5 tract , compared to the spanish strains , showed a genetic distance of less than 10 % .
on the basis of the molecular classification according to kuno and colleagues [ 4 ] , this divergence is low enough to classify the piedmont strain within the mmv species .
unfortunately , this virus has not yet been well characterized , no further hypotheses can be made , and an appropriate host is lacking .
conclusions our results confirm the circulation and establishment of usutu virus in eastern piedmont due to the presence of the virus within the local cx. pipiens population .
the detection of the potentially zoonotic mmv species in the same trap in two consecutive years highlights its presence in a specific geographic area in alessandria province , but within a widened area , even though a direct connection between the spanish and italian strains cannot be made due to lack of data .
furthermore , the detection of integrated dna of viral origin in the mosquito genome may help to better understand host - pathogen interactions .
continued intense mosquito - based surveillance in piedmont , supported by a mosquito control program in areas at high risk for human exposure , is therefore essential .
collection of a large sample of high - quality data is key to determine the genetic relationships among mosquito - borne viruses and evaluate their real zoonotic potential .

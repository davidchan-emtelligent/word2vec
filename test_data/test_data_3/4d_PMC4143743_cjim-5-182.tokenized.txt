background : eosinophilic gastroenteritis ( eg ) is rare and is characterized by recurrent eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract and chronic diarrhea .
in this report we present a case of eg with acute pancreatitis and deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) .
case presentation : a 30 years old male was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of epigastric pain , vomitting and swelling of his left limb for the past six days .
he was also having diarrhea for the last several months .
he had been evaluated for chronic diarrhea and ascites before he sought the current consultation .
duplex color doppler of left limb showed dvt of distal calf vein .
contrast enhanced ct imaging of abdomen revealed thickening of duodenum , proximal jejunal wall and presence of ascites .
duodenal biopsy showed normal villous pattern with mild inflammation and eosinophilic infiltration .
the constellation of clinical presentation , hypereosinophilia , ct and biopsy findings all is in consistence to eg. the patient was treated with prednisolone 20 mg / day for four weeks and tapered slowly .
acute pancreatitis was managed conservatively while dvt was treated with heparin and oral anticoagulants .
the patient 's diarrhea settled and ascites resolved completely .
at follow up , the absolute eosinophil count was 300 / mul and the patient was doing well .
conclusion : this case report emphasizes that one should consider these rare disorders during the differential diagnosis of unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms in the presence of hypereosinophilia .
key words eosinophilic gastroenteritis acute pancreatitis deep vein thrombosis eosinophilic gastroenteritis ( ege ) , a rare disease is characterized by recurrent eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal ( gi ) tract leading to nonspecific gi symptoms that are usually associated with peripheral eosinophilia .
it is one of the rare cause of chronic diarrhea ( 1 ) .
hypereosinophilic syndrome ( hes ) applies to all clinical presentations in which hypereosinophilia ( he ) is directly linked to tissue damage , regardless of whether he can be ascribed to a reactive process , neoplastic process , or another underlying disease ( 2 ). there are three subtypes of ege , mucosal , muscular , and subserosal .
however , the mucosal form is the most common ( 3 ) .
clinical manifestations range from non - specific gastrointestinal complaints to more specific symptoms such as protein - losing enteropathy , luminal obstruction and eosinophilic ascites .
peripheral eosinophilia is common in all subtypes of ege and is noted in 60 - 80 % of the patients ( 1 ) .
endoscopic findings may be nonspecific and can range from erythema , friability to erosions .
biopsy is highly suggestive of ege but diagnosis can be missed in up to 25 % of cases ( 4 ) .
moreover , in cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain , ct imaging can help in localizing areas of thickened bowel ( 5 ) .
we report a case of chronic diarrhea and eosinophilic ascites , an uncommon presentration of ege which was complicated by acute pancreatitis and deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) of left lower limb simultaneously , a rare clinical association .
case report a 30 - year old male was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of epigastric pain , vomitting and swelling of his left limb for past six days .
he was also having diarrhea for the last several months .
detailed history revealed that he had been reasonably evaluated for chronic diarrhea and ascites for the last six months before he sought the current consultation .
there was no history of fever , jaundice , blood in the stool or any bladder symptoms .
he was non - alcoholic and had no personal or family history of any allergy or asthma .
on admission , the patient looked emaciated with dry skin , had oral temperature of 98 0 f , pulse - 90 beats / min and blood pressure of 130 / 90 mmhg .
abdominal examination revealed periumbilical tenderness with appreciable ascites and there were no signs suggestive of chronic liver disease .
he had edematous and tender swelling of his left leg with limited passive mobility .
his peripheral pulses were normal .
laboratory investigations showed hemoglobin - 10.7 g / dl , total leukocyte count - 10,800 / mm3 with predominant eosinophils ( 22 %) , absolute eosinophil count - 2,376 / mm3 ( normal range , 0 to 500 / mm3 ) and platelet count - 2.5 lakh / cumm3 .
serum amylase measured 650u / l ( reference range : 0 - 200 u / l ) , serum lipase - 150 u / l ( reference range : 30 - 110 u / l ) , serum bilirubin - 1.0 mg / dl , serum albumin - 4.5 mg / dl , aspartate transaminase - 46 iu / l , alanine transaminase - 80 iu / l and alkaline phosphatase - 42 u / l. he was tested negative for hiv - 1 and 2 ( elisa ) , hbsag and anti - hcv antibody .
routine stool examination and fecal fat estimation of the stool was normal .
ultrasound showed moderate ascites with normal echotexture of the liver and mild oedematous pancreas .
ascitic fluid study revealed high saag ascites with total leukocyte count - 1000 / ml , 90 % of which were eosinophils ( figure 1 ) , adenosine deaminase ( ada ) - 18 iu / l and amylase - 28u / l ( range , 0 - 100 u / l ) .
serum ige level was elevated at 548 iu / ml ( normal < 180 iu / ml ) .
duplex color doppler of left limb showed thrombotic occlusion at the level of distal calf vein suggestive of deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) .
contrast enhanced ct imaging of abdomen done two days later revealed thickening of duodenum , proximal jejunal wall and presence of ascites ( figure 2 ) with mildly enlarged pancreas ( figure 3 ) .
once the patient was stable , upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed mild hyperemia of antral mucosa of stomach , and duodenum .
duodenal biopsy showed normal villous pattern with mild inflammation and eosinophilic infiltration ( 12 / hpf ) .
to ascertain other causes of he , bone marrow biopsy was done which revealed erythroid hyperplasia with normoblastic erythropiesis and prominent esonophilic infiltration ( 25 %) ( figure 4 ) .

the constellation of clinical presentation , hypereosinophilia , ct and biopsy findings and an avid clinical response to steroids was suggestive of ege .
acute pancreatitis was managed conservatively while dvt was treated with low molecular weight heparin and oral anticoagulants .
to treat ege and manage he , the patient was put on oral prednisone ( 20mg / day ) for four weeks and tapered slowly .
the patient 's diarrhea settled and ascites resolved completely .
at follow - up , a repeat peripheral blood count showed a considerable fall in the absolute eosinophil count ( 300 / mul ) and the patient was doing well .
discussion eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are exceedingly rare and manifest through all races and ages , from infancy through adulthood ( 6 ) .
in hes , eosinophil - induced organ damage may vary from angioedema , eczema and peripheral neuropathy to cardiac fibrosis and thrombosis .
about 25 % of cases with hes , however , have eosinophilic infiltration in the gastrointestinal tract and there may be little to distinguish between ege and hes , especially if the latter is early in the clinical course and restricted to the intestinal mucosa alone ( 7 ) .
after a reasonable workup , the cause of diarrhea and eosinophilic ascites in our patient seemed to be ege which was supported further by the biopsy , ct findings and an avid clinical response to the steroid therapy .
chronic diarrhea and eosinophilic ascites are rare manifestations of ege ( 1 ) .
acute pancreatitis has been previously reported in association with ege ( 8 ) .
however , the unusual complication of acute dvt and acute pancreatitis occurring simultaneously in a patient with ege makes it a very rare case .
initially , pancreatitis seemed to be of unclear etiology as our patient was non - alcoholic and had no history of any gall bladder disease .
nonetheless , eosoninophil - induced direct toxic endothelial injury or obstruction of the pancreatic duct may explain the cause of acute pancreatitis in our case ( 9 ) .
the mechanism of dvt in our case can be explained by endothelial dysfunction due to the degranulation of activated eosinophils ( cationic protein , major basic protein ) and inhibition of the natural anticoagulant pathways ( thrombomodulin , heparan sulphate , and antithrombin iii ) ( 10 ) .
the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders ( egid ) should be considered in patients with history of chronic diarrhea , peripheral esonophilia and esonophilic ascites .
evaluation and risk determination for hypereosinophilic syndrome ( hes ) in patients with apparent egid is also important .
our case also emphasizes the importance of being aware of the ' forme frustes' of hypereosinophilic syndrome and various complications arising from the same .
conflict of interest : there is no conflict of interest .

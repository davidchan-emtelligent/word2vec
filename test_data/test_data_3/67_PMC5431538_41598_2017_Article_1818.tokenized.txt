pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( pjp ) is a potentially life - threatening infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients .
the aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors for pjp in kidney transplantation recipients .
we conducted a retrospective analysis of patient data from 500 consecutive kidney transplants performed at severance hospital between april 2011 and april 2014 .
eighteen kidney transplantation recipients ( 3.6 %) were diagnosed with pjp .
in the univariate analysis , acute graft rejection , cmv infection , use of medication for diabetes mellitus , and lowest lymphocyte count were associated with pjp .
recipients who experienced acute graft rejection ( odds ratio [ or ] 11.81 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 3.06 - 45.57 , p < 0.001 ) or developed cmv infection ( or 5.42 , 95 % ci 1.69 - 17.39 , p = 0.005 ) had high odds of pjp in multivariate analysis .
in the acute graft rejection subgroup , patients treated with anti - thymocyte globulin ( atg ) had significantly higher odds of pjp ( or 5.25 , 95 % ci 1.01 - 27.36 , p = 0.006 ) than those who were not .
our data suggest that acute graft rejection and cmv infection may be risk factors for pjp in kidney transplant patients .
the use of atg for acute graft rejection may increase the risk of pjp .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction pneumocystis jirovecii is an opportunistic fungal pathogen1 .
pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( pjp ) previously known as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is a potentially life - threatening infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients1 , 2 .
in the absence of prophylaxis , pjp occurs in approximately 5 - 15 % of transplant patients , depending on the transplanted organ or transplant center2 , 3 .
in kidney transplantation , pjp is a very serious risk factor for graft loss and patient mortality4 , 5 .
in the absence of appropriate treatment , the mortality rate of pjp is 90 - 100 % , and can be as high as 50 % despite adequate therapy6 , 7 .
therefore , several guidelines - - such as the kidney disease improving global outcomes ( kdigo ) guideline , the european renal best practice guideline , and other reports - - usually recommend pjp prophylaxis by using tmp / smx for 3 - 6 months after renal transplantation8 - 10 .
the incidence rate of pjp has decreased with the use of prophylaxis , however , an increasing number of pjp outbreaks in kidney transplant centers has been reported worldwide in recent years4 , 5 , 11 .
the causes of those outbreaks have not fully been evaluated .
risk factors for the development of pjp in kidney transplant patients are still not confirmed .
the overall load of immunosuppressive therapy , higher donor age , higher recipient age , lymphopenia , previous cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) infection , or treatment used for episodes of graft rejection have been reported as risk factors for pjp in kidney transplant patients12 - 17 .
however , factors identified in some studies are not always confirmed in other studies .
thus , further research is needed to evaluate the risk factors for pjp in kidney transplant patients in the era of routine pjp prophylaxis .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for pjp in kidney transplantation recipients .
patients and methods study design and population this single center , retrospective clinical study included all kidney transplant patients aged >= 18 years who underwent kidney transplantation at the severance hospital , a 2000 - bed university tertiary referral hospital in south korea , from april 2011 to april 2014 .
during this period , 500 patients underwent kidney transplantation ; they were followed up until october 2015 .
we divided the patients into two groups according to the occurrence of pjp - - the case group developed pjp whereas the control group did not - - and then compared the groups .
in our center , all kidney transplant recipients receive pjp prophylaxis using trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole ( tmp / smx ) 160 / 800 mg per day for 12 months post - transplantation .
after transplantation , patients received a tacrolimus - based combination regimen or a cyclosporine - based combination regimen for maintaining immunosuppression .
data collection data from all kidney transplant recipients were collected from the hospital 's electronic medical records .
clinical data on mortality , development of pjp , demographic characteristics , graft origin ( deceased vs. living ) , immunosuppressive regimen , data about acute graft rejection such as frequency of such episodes or treatment received , smoking status , history of infections including cmv , bk virus , hepatitis , tuberculosis ( tb ) , and comorbidities were evaluated .
definition we defined pjp when the following two conditions were satisfied ; first , a positive result on pneumocystis jirovecii real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) testing or direct immunofluorescence testing of microbiological samples ( sputum , tracheal aspirate , bronchial washing fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ) and second , identification of lung infiltration on chest computed tomography ( ct ) 18 - 20 .
cmv infection was defined as a fourfold elevation of the cmv pcr titer and the use of cmv medication ( ganciclovir or valganciclovir ) .
smoking status was categorized as ever smoker or never smoked ; the latter category included those who smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime .
development of acute graft rejection was established by biopsy of the transplanted kidney .
steroid pulse therapy ( methylprednisolone [ 500 mg / day x 4 for 5 days ]) was considered the first line therapy for acute graft rejection .
when there was an inadequate response to steroid pulse therapy , an anti - thyomcyte globulin ( atg ) was used .
lowest lymphocyte count was reviewed during follow - up in the pjp negative group after first hospital discharge and within 1 month before diagnosis of pjp in the pjp group .
clinical characteristics and events were reviewed until the last follow - up date in the pjp negative group and were reviewed until the date of pjp development in the pjp group .
ethical approval the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board ( irb ) of severance hospital ( irb number : 4 - 2015 - 1051 ) .
all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations .
informed consent was waived by the irb because of the study 's retrospective nature .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss version 20 ( ibm , armonk , new york , usa ) .
data are described as medians ( interquartile range [ iqr ]) or numbers ( percentages ) .
the chi - squared and fisher 's exact test or the mann - whitney test was used to assess differences between two groups .
the independent risk for pjp was identified using logistic regression modeling .
the fundamental variable ( such as age , gender , bmi or kidney transplantation type ) and variable which were meaningful risk factors in univariate analysis were used in multivariate analysis .
a two - tailed p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results characteristics of the overall study population and patients diagnosed with pjp demographic and clinical characteristics of the total study population are presented in table 1 .
overall , 500 patients were enrolled over the 3 - year study period , with a similar number enrolled each year .
the median age of all recipients was 47 years ( range , 18 - 71 ) and men accounted for 61.4 % .
the major cause of kidney transplantation was hypertension ( 39.6 %) ; the other cause was diabetes mellitus ( 17.0 %) .
transplanted kidneys were sourced more often from living than deceased donors ( 64.4 % living vs. 35.6 % deceased ) .
in terms of immunosuppressive medication , 440 ( 88 %) patients received a tacrolimus - based combination regimen and 60 ( 12 %) received a cyclosporine - based combination regimen .
the median duration of follow up was 36.2 month ( range , 18.4 - 54.6 ) .

eighteen patients were diagnosed with pjp during the study period , and most cases developed 12 - 24 months after kidney transplantation .
all patients diagnosed with pjp were started on tmp / smx .
five patients required second - line medication because of disease progression despite tmp - smx use ; four were treated with primaquine and clindamycin , while one was treated with pentamidine .
twelve ( 66.7 %) patients with pjp improved after treatment , with no sequelae .
however , three ( 16.7 %) patients had residual sequelae and three ( 16.7 %) died .

risk factors for pjp in the total population table 3 shows the risk factors for pjp .
in the univariate analysis , more men than women developed pjp , although this was not statistically significant ( 60.6 % vs. 83.3 % , respectively , p = 0.052 ) .
median age , duration of follow up , graft source ( deceased vs. living donor ) , proportion of re - transplant patients , and smoking status did not differ significantly between those who had pjp and those who did not .
the underlying cause of kidney disease , necessitating transplantation , varied .
however , hypertension , diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , and iga nephropathy were the major causes in both groups ( p = 0.102 ) .
more acute graft rejection after transplantation wwere observed in the pjp group compared with the pjp negative group ( 83.3 % vs. 20.1 % , respectively , p < 0.001 ). and cmv infection was more common in the pjp group than the pjp negative group ( 61.1 % vs. 12.9 % , respectively , p < 0.001 ) .
acute rejection and cmv infection were checked until pjp pneumonia in pjp group .
among those patients in the pjp group , 50 % used medication for dm , compared to 26.1 % in the pjp negative group ( p = 0.032 ) .
lowest lymphocyte counts were lower in the pjp group than in the control group ( 0.3 x 103 / microl vs. 0.7 x 103 / microl , p = 0.007 ) .
in terms of immunosuppressive agents , patients received either tacrolimus - or cyclosporine - based regimens ; the regimen used did not differ between the pjp group and the control group ( p = 0.710 ) .
in the multivariate analysis , acute graft rejection [ odds ratio ( or ) , 11.81 ; 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 3.06 - 45.57 ] and cmv infection ( or , 5.42 ; 95 % ci , 1.69 - 17.93 ) were associated with pjp , whereas sex , age , body mass index ( bmi ) , and graft source were not .

acute graft rejection and cmv infection were important risk factors for pjp , as presented in table 3 .
to understand the impact of acute graft rejection and cmv pneumonia on pjp , we investigated the timing of the onset of pjp after acute graft rejection or cmv infection .
the median interval between acute graft rejection and pjp was 6.1 ( iqr , 3.3 - 12.9 ) months , while the median interval between cmv infection and pjp was 1.5 ( iqr , 0.1 - 7.1 ) months ( fig. 1a and b ) .

note : pjp , pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia .
risk factors for pjp in patients experiencing acute graft rejection as shown in table 3 , most cases of pjp ( 83.3 %) occurred after acute graft rejection .
hence , we performed a subgroup analysis of the risk factors for pjp in patients who developed acute graft rejection ( table 4 ). of the 500 kidney transplant patients , 112 experienced acute graft rejection. of those , 15 were diagnosed with pjp .
sex , median age , bmi , graft source , smoking status , bk virus infection , use of dm medication , development of acute graft rejection within 1 - year post - transplant , number of acute graft rejection episodes , and lowest lymphocyte count did not differ between patients who developed pjp and those who did not .
all patients who developed acute graft rejection were managed with steroid pulse therapy .
however , additional use of atg for acute graft rejection treatment was more used in the pjp group ( 73.3 % vs. 39.2 % , p = 0.013 ) .
in addition , the proportion of patients with cmv infection was higher in the pjp group than in the pjp negative group ( 66.7 % vs. 34 % , respectively , p = 0.016 ) .
in the multivariate analysis , the independent risk factors for pjp in the acute graft rejection subgroup were identified as male sex ( or , 6.45 ; 95 % ci , 1.24 - 33.73 ) and the use of atg ( or , 5.25 ; 95 % ci , 1.01 - 27.36 ) .

discussion in our study , of 500 kidney transplant patients , 18 developed pjp .
acute graft rejection and cmv infection were identified as risk factors for pjp .
within the subgroup of patients who experienced acute graft rejection , male sex and the use of atg were risk factors for pjp .
our data showed that more patients in the pjp group than in the pjp negative group had cmv infection .
this result is in agreement with that of previous studies17 , 21 .
cmv is known to modify host immune responses by various mechanisms , suppressing helper t - cell and antigen presenting cell functions22 .
therefore , cmv infection is both a marker of an immunocompromised state and has , itself , an immunosuppressive effect23 .
therefore , when one opportunistic infection is diagnosed in transplant patients , physicians should consider that patients may at the same time or in the following weeks / months present with another opportunistic infection .
several articles have reported that the development of acute graft rejection is a risk factor for pjp10 , 13 , 15 , 17 .
our data were similar .
when acute graft rejection occurs , patients are treated with steroid pulse therapy or other immunosuppressive agents .
these results support the hypothesis that severe immunosuppression may increase the occurrence of pjp .
similarly , low lymphocyte counts have been reported to be associated with the development of pjp12 .
our data showed that the median lowest lymphocyte count was relatively low in the pjp group .
although this result was not evident in multivariate analysis , the univariate analysis still suggests the importance of lymphocytes in the development of pjp infection .
previous studies have reported other risk factors for pjp in patients who have undergone kidney transplantation3 , 15 , 24 .
lufft et al. first reported that different immunosuppressive regimens could affect the occurrence of pjp in renal transplant recipients24 .
in their report , tacrolimus - based regimens seemed more likely to trigger pjp , but this was not confirmed .
mmf was suggested for use as an immunosuppressive agent having anti - pjp effects25 , 26 .
in our study , there was no difference in the occurrence of pjp between the groups of patients receiving tacrolimus - or cyclosporine - based regimens .
we could not analyze the effect of mmf on pjp because kidney transplant recipients at our center almost used mmf .
further research on the effect of immunosuppressive regimens on development of pjp is needed .
we performed further evaluation of patients ( n = 112 ) who experienced acute graft rejection .
arend et al. reported that the incidence of pjp among patients treated for 0 , 1 , 2 , or >= 3 rejection episodes increased with the increasing number of rejection episodes .
the proportion of patients requiring additional atg for an episode of rejection was higher in the pjp positive group than in the control group27 .
in our study , there was no association between the number of acute graft rejection episodes and pjp .
only additional use of atg for treatment of acute graft rejection was associated with the development of pjp in the acute graft rejection subgroup .
pjp occurred in four patients whilst taking pjp prophylaxis , three of whom had used additional atg treatment prior to developing pjp .
these results suggest that immunosuppressive status is more important than other factors in the development of pjp .
all guidelines recommend pjp prophylaxis for a certain period after kidney transplantation , although no universal consensus exists on the optimal duration of prophylaxis8 - 10 .
our data indicated that acute graft rejection , cmv infection , and atg use in the acute graft rejection subgroup could be the risk factors for pjp .
thus , further pjp prophylaxis is suggested in patients who have these risk factors , based on our data .
in terms of the duration of prophylaxis , most cases of pjp occurring after acute graft rejection occurred within 12 months , and most cases of pjp occurring after an episode of cmv infection occurred within 6 months .
hence , we suggest a 6 - 12 month course of prophylaxis following either an episode of acute graft rejection or cmv infection .
although some complications have been reported with the use of tmp / smx for pjp prophylaxis , major complications are relatively rare28 ; therefore , the benefits of pjp prophylaxis outweigh the risks .
there are several limitations to our study .
first , we used the results of pcr as well as direct immunofluorescence to diagnose pjp .
thus , our data might include patients with false positive results .
in general , confirmation of pjp requires special microbiological stains of sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) specimens29 .
however , the proportion of pjp cases in hiv - uninfected patients in which is confirmed as organism in respiratory specimens is relatively low ( compared with hiv - infected patients ) because of the low burden of organism30 - 32 .
pneumocystis jirovecii pcr assays are sensitive and increase the diagnostic yield in hiv - uninfected immunocompromised patients33 - 35 .
we used chest ct findings at initial diagnosis of pjp to exclude patients with false positive pneumocystis jirovecii pcr results .
second , the number of pjp patients in our study was relatively small .
however , unlike other studies , our study collected data on a large number of consecutive kidney transplant patients , instead of selecting particular patients ; this point can be its strength .
third , patients with cmv infection and patients who used atg overlapped in the acute graft rejection subgroup .
thus , we could not analyze the independent effect of cmv infection or atg use on pjp .
fourth , this study was retrospective , thus , we could not systemically analyze multiple laboratory test results .
there is a need for further , prospective studies to assess the risk factors for pjp .
conclusion our data suggest that acute graft rejection and cmv infection may be risk factors for pjp in kidney transplant patients .
in patients who develop acute graft rejection , the use of atg may increase the risk of pjp .
we suggest providing further pjp prophylaxis for kidney transplant patients who develop cmv infection or acute graft rejection , especially for those treated with atg .

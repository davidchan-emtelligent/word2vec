the objective is to identify nail unit changes associated with connective tissue diseases ( ctd ) and evaluate their frequency .
we carried a prospective study between march 2012 and march2013 in our department .
all patients with ctd were included .
a clinical examination of the fingernails was done by the same dermatologist .
nail features were noted and classified and photos taken .
thirty nine patients were enrolled including : 16 systemic sclerosis , 14 lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , 8 dermatomyositis ( dm ) , 1 primary sjorgen 's syndrome .
the mean age was 40 years old .
the mean duration of the disease was 6 years .
nail unit changes were present in 27 patients ( 69 %) .
the abnormalities observed were longitidunal ridging in 11 patients , peri ungueal erythema in 10 patients , peri - ungual telangiectasia in 11 patients , ragged cuticle in 10 patients fingertips scars in 9 patients , increase of longitudinal curvature and beaking of the nail in 4 patients , increase in transverse curvature in 4 patients , dyschromia of the proximal nail fold in 3 patients , subungual hyperkeratosis in 3 patients , onycholysis in 2 patients , splinter haemorrhages in 3 patients , nail plate pigmentation in 2 patients , pseudoclubbing in 1 patient , macrolunula in 1 patients , red lunulae in one patient , bluish - black discoloration of the nail plate in one patient .
the proximal nailfold was found to be most sites affected .
nail changes connective tissue diseases nail fold periungueal telangiectasia longitudinal ridging fingertips scars peri ungueal erythema ragged cuticle introduction nail changes in connective tissue diseases ( ctd ) are common .
most of them are not specific however they may give an important clue to the diagnosis .
thus their knowledge is important for dermatologists and internists .
methods prospective study was carried in our department between februaury 2012 and march 2013 .
all patients with connective tissue diseases ( lupus , scleroderma,dermatomyositis , primary sjorgen syndrome ) were included .
a detailed clinical examination ( by the the naked eye ) of the fingernails unit was done by the same dermatologist .
nail features were noted and classified .
photos were taken .
results thirty nine patients were enrolled in the study ( 33 females , 6 males ) including : 16 systemic sclerosis , 14 lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , 8 dermatomyositis , one primary sjorgen 's syndrome .
the mean age was 40 years old .
the mean duration of the disease was 6 years .
nail unit changes were present in 27 patients ( 69 %) .
out of 16 patients with scleroderma , 14 had nail changes .
the abnormalities observed were : nail fold telangiectasia ( 9patients ) , ragged cuticles ( 6 patients ) , longitidunal ridging ( 4 patients ) ( figure 1 :) , increase of longitudinal curvature , and beaking of the nail ( 4patients ) ( figure 2 :) , increase in transverse curvature ( 4 patients ) ( figure 3 :) , longitudinal melanonychia ( 2patients ) ventral pterygium ( 2patients ) , pseudoclubbing ( 1patient ) , macrolunula ( 1patient ) , subungual keratosis in one patient .
ten patients had fingertip scars and two had digital necrosis .
seven patients with sle showed nail changes , proximal nail - fold erythema was noted in 4 patients , longitudinal ridging in 4 patients , bluish - black discoloration of the nail plate in one patient ( figure 4 :) , onycholysis in 2patients , subungual hyperkeratosis in 2patients ( figure 5 :) splinter haemorrhages in 3 patients ( figure 6 :) and red lunula in one patient .
all the patients with nail changes in dermatomyositis group ( 6 patients ) had nail fold erythema .
four of them had ragged , hyperkeratosic cuticles ( figure 7 :) , 2 had nail fold telagiectasia and 3had longitudinal ridging .
figure 1 longitudinal ridging , ragged cuticle and periungual telangiectasia in a patient with systemic sclerosis figure 2 beaking of the nail in a paient with systemic sclerosis figure 3 increase of transversal curvature and ragged cuticle in a patient with systemic sclerosis figure 4 bluish coloration of the nail plate in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus figure 5 subungueal keratosis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus figure 6 splinter haemorrhage in a patient with a clinically active systemic lupus erythematosus figure 7 ragged cuticle and periungueal erythema in a patient with dermatomyositis discussion nail unit changes were present in 27 patients ( 69 , 2 %) .
the proximal nailfold was found as the most site affected .
the aspects most frequently seen were nail fold telangiectasia and longitudinal ridging .
these results were similar to previous studies [ 1 , 2 ] ( table 1 ) .
in scleroderma patients , nail fold telangiectasia was the abnormality most frequently seen .
the other changes observed were longitudinal ridging , ragged cuticle , increase of longitudinal curvature , increase in transverse curvature and beaking of the nail , marcrolunula , pseudoclubbing .
all patients had raynaud 's phenomen and digital scars .
this finding was consistent with other studies axel f g von bierbrauer [ 3 ] performed nail fold biopsies of 24 patients with scleroderma .
the main finding were perivascular round cell ( 70,8 %) , mast cells and fibroblasts ( 45,8 %) infiltrations , increased amounts of connective tissue ( 75 %) , signs of microangiopathy ( 87 - 5 %) , splitting of the l - basallamina ( 66,7 %) , perivascular oedema ( 41,7 %) , deposits of complement c3 ( 66 %) , igg ( 62 %) , or both in the vessel wall and in the perivascular region , perivascular deposits of amorphic material ( 25 %) .
these features are not specific .
similar histopathological changes have been reported in lupus erythematosus , , dermatomyositis , mixed connective tissue disease , and diabetes [ 3 - 5 ] .

increase in transverse curvature of patients with systemic sclerosis ( ssc ) was found to be associated significantly with disease activity .
other studies showed that there is an association between the degree of nail fold capillary abnormality ( as detected by capillaroscopy ) and internal organ involvement and mortality in scleroderma patients [ 6 , 7 ] .
patients with raynaud 's disease are likely to develop systemic manifestations later in the course of the disease when they have associated nail fold telangiactasia [ 8 ] .
commonest nail change observed in our patients with sle was proximal nail - fold erythema .
this finding was consistent with other studies .
other changes observed were longitidunal ridging , splinter haemorrhages , bluish black discoloration of the nail plate , onycholysis , subungual hyperkeratosis and red lunula .
ventral pterygium , thin nail - plate , beau line , longitudinal melanonychia , pincer nail deformity punctate or striate leuconychia , nail pitting ) lupus erythematosus unguium mutilanswere also reported to be found in patients with sle. [ 2 , 9 - 11 ] in the study of se tunc , splinter haemorrhage in fingernails of patients with sle was found to be associated significantly with disease activity [ 2 ] .
urowitz mb found that the incidence of mucous membrane ulcerations and raynaud 's phenomenon was in sle patients who had nail abnomalities [ 12 ] .
the different types of nail lesions encountered in patients with le are classified into those that are histologically specific for le ( discoid le of the nail unit hypertrophic le chilblains le lupus erythematosus unguium mutilans ) and those that are not ( leuconychia , nail pitting , ridging , onycholysis , nail dyschromia , nail fold erythema , red lunulae , nail fold hyperkeratosis , ragged cuticles , and splinter haemorrhages , vasculopathic lesions of the nail unit , pterygium inversum unguis. [ 9 ] direct immunofluorescence of proximal nail fold changes in sle shows the typical immune deposit pattern ofle ( lupus band ) at the dermal - epidermal .
in dermatomyositis patients , abnormalities seen were periungual erythema , hyperkeratosic , ragged cuticles , nail fold telangiectasia and longitudinal ridging .
other works have reported splinter haemorrhages , capillary loops in proximal nailfold , red lunulae , loss of several toenails [ 13 - 16 ] cuticular changes ( thickening and hyperkeratosis hardness , roughness ) are common in dm. these alterations , described by keining in 1939 [ 13 ] , are not pathognomonic ; similar cuticular changes have been reported in scleroderma and lupus erythematous .
although a characteristic feature of dm is the association of cuticular changes with periungual erythema,telangiectasia and hemorrhages [ 14 ] .
all our patients with cuticular changes had periungueal erythema .
samitz reported that resolution of cuticular changes occurred with improvement of the patients dermatomyositis and reappeared with recurrences of the disease paralleling its severity [ 15 ] .
tr ekmekci , noticed that cuticles were the first site healed in a patient with dermatomyositis and considered that it may be an indicator of clinical remission [ 17 ] .
the majority of nail complex changes associated with connective tissue diseases represent non specific reaction pattern .
their mechanism is unknown , but it is probably due to vasculitic process [ 1 , 2 ] .
conclusion knowledge of nail changes in ctd may provide clues to the diagnosis , differenciate them from other onychopathies such as onychomycosis and provides prognostic information [ 1 ] .
especially when associated with other diagnostic tools like biopsy of the nailfold and capillaroscopy or dermoscopy .

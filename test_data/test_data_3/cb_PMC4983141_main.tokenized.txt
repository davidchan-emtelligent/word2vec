* these data are raw data obtained from our studies about the non - extractable fraction of dried persimmon .
there are very few study of non - extractable fraction both in vitro and in vivo , and we disclose our raw data of antioxidant activities of non - extractable fraction of persimmon to the scientific researchers .
* the data in this article might contribute to evaluate antioxidant potential of other fruits and vegetables .
1 data in vitro antioxidant activities of each fraction of dried persimmon using both orac and dpph radical - scavenging activities at three times was showed ( table 1 , table 2 ) .
raw data of plasma orac value of each animal was showed in table 3 .
plasma concentration of tg and hdl - c were showed in fig. 2. orac values of digestion mixtures of in vitro model of gastrointestinal digestion was showed in table 4 .
2. experimental design , materials and methods 2.1 sample preparation dried persimmons ( 1.72 kg ) were pitted ( 1.49 kg of edible portion ) , cut into small pieces , and homogenized in 10 l of 90 % aqueous ethanol ( etoh ) , and the extract was filtered from the homogenate .
another 10 l of 90 % aqueous etoh was added to the residue .
these extracting and filtering procedures were repeated three times and the combined filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to remove etoh .
the etoh extract was dissolved in h2o and then added hexane , and was partitioned between h2o and hexane .
the aqueous fraction was separated by column chromatography using a diaion hp - 20 gel with h2o as an eluting solution followed by elution with meoh .
all solutions were evaporated in vacuo to give hexane soluble layer ( 4.1 g ) , h2o ( 1.28 kg ) and meoh ( 3.4 g ) eluates ( fig. 1 ) .
on the other hand , the extraction residue was dehydrated to obtain the non - extractable fraction as dried powder ( 352 g ) .
2.2 preparation of hydrolyzed non - extractable fraction portions ( 100 mg ) of the non - extractable fraction were heated at 90 degreesc for 3 h with 5 ml of 1.2 n hcl - 50 % meoh solution in screw - capped tubes and were then centrifuged at 1750xg for 15 min at room temperature to obtain supernatants .
subsequently , 5 ml of 1.2 n hcl - 50 % meoh solution was added to the precipitates and was then heated and centrifuged twice .
combined supernatants were diluted to 25 ml using meoh .
2.3 antioxidant activity of dried astringent persimmon orac values of each fraction were measured according to a previously described method [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] with slight modifications .
this assay was performed based on the principle that antioxidant compounds delay decreases in fluorescein fluorescence following the addition of the peroxyl radical generator aaph .
orac assays were performed using an arvotm x4 microplate reader at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm. the fluorescence of each microplate well was recorded every 2 min over a 90 - min period at 37 degreesc .
the area under the fluorescence curve was calculated , and orac values for each sample were expressed as units for 1 - mumol equivalents of trolox .
each sample was measured in triplicate .
antioxidant activities of extracts were estimated based on scavenging activities of the stable dpph free radical using a previously described method [ 4 ] with slight modifications .
briefly , sample absorbance was measured at 517 nm using etoh as the blank and ascorbic acid as the standard .
radical scavenging activities of samples are expressed as ascorbic acid equivalents .
the raw data at three times of orac values and dpph radical - scavenging activities of dried persimmon fractions are shown in table 1 , table 2 .
2.4 animal study 2.4.1 animal and feeding procedures eight - week - old male rats ( wistar strain ) were purchased from japan slc ( hamamatsu , shizuoka , japan ) .
rats were randomly divided into three groups of eight animals , and each animal was individually housed .
rats of the control diet group were fed an ain - 93g - modified basal diet ( clea japan inc. , tokyo , japan ) and those of the positive control group were fed tea catechin supplemented basal diet .
a group of rats were fed a basal diet supplemented with 5 % non - extractable fraction of dried persimmon instead of cellulose .
catechin contents in diets were calculated according to equivalent orac values in the non - extractable fraction diet , and beta - cyclodextrin was added to reduce the bitterness of tea catechin .
animals were fed ad libitum , and food intake and body weights were monitored daily for 3 weeks .
blood was collected from tail veins weekly and plasma was isolated and stored at - 80 degreesc .
all animal procedures were performed according to kio university 's guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals , which are in compliance with the japanese law for the humane treatment and management of animals .
2.4.2 plasma orac assays plasma orac values were determined according to previously described methods [ 5 ] .
briefly , plasma samples were removed from storage at - 80 degreesc and were slowly thawed and shaken using a vortex .
plasma aliquots ( 50 mul ) were then transferred into microtubes and 100 mul of etoh and 50 mul of h2o were added .
solutions were then shaken for 30 s using a vortex , and 200 mul of 0.75 m metaphosphoric acid was then added .
subsequently , mixtures were shaken using a vortex and centrifuged at 210xg for 5 min at 10 degreesc .
prior to orac analyses , 80 mul aliquots of supernatants were diluted into 420 mul of 75 mm phosphate buffer ( ph 7.4 ) to obtain plasma solutions .
further dilutions ( 2 - 8 times ) of plasma solutions were performed using 75 mm phosphate buffer ( ph 7.4 ) , and 20 mul aliquots were then transferred into microplates for orac assays .
the raw data of plasma orac values of 8 animals of each diet group are shown in table 3 .
2.4.3 plasma concentration of tg and hdl - c plasma concentration of tg was determined using commercially available kits ( triglyceride e - test wako , wako pure chemical industries , osaka , japan ) .
hdl - c level were measured using commercially kits ( hdl - cholesterol e - test wako , wako pure chemical industries , osaka , japan ) .
2.5 in vitro model of gastrointestinal digestion 2.5.1 conditions for in vitro digestion the present model of gastrointestinal digestion was performed as previously described [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
the model describes a four - step procedure performed to mimic the digestive process in the oral cavity , stomach , small intestine , and large intestine at 37 degreesc .
initially , 40 mg of alpha - amylase ( 20 units / mg , wako pure chemical industries , osaka , japan ) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer ( ph 6.9 ) containing 0.04 % nacl , and 0.004 % cacl2 was added to 300 mg samples of the non - extractable fraction and was incubated for 5 min for the oral digestion stage .
following oral digestion , gastric digestion was initiated by adjusting the ph to 2 using hcl and adding 60 mg of a porcine - pepsin solution ( 20 units / mg , wako pure chemical industries , osaka , japan ) in 0.01 m hcl containing 0.9 % nacl .
the mixture was then stirred gently for 1 h. subsequently , 1 m nahco3 was added and gently stirred for 6 h with 35 mg of bile powder and 5 mg of pancreatin in 2 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer ( ph 7.5 ) to adjust the ph to 6.5 and simulate small intestinal digestion .
finally , large intestinal digestion was simulated by fermentation of half amount of each samples following the addition of 14 ml of inoculum for 24 h under anaerobic conditions , and subsequent incubation in an anaerobic jar using an anaero pack system ( mitsubishi gas chemical company , inc. , tokyo , japan ) .
inoculum was prepared by homogenizing feces from rats fed the control diet .
feces were collected under a flow of co2 gas through the sampling bottle and were homogenized using a 10 - fold prepared medium containing 2.5 g / l peptone , 2.5 g / l yeast extract , 0.9 g / l nacl , 0.45 g / l kh2po4 , 0.027 g / l cacl2.2h2o , 0.02 g / l mgcl2.6h2o , 0.008 g / l mnso4.5h2o , 0.01 g / l cocl2 , 0.9 g / l ( nh4 ) so4 , 0.008 g / l feso4.7h2o , 0.34 g / l k2hpo4 , 0.003 g / l hemin , 0.001 g / l resazurin and 1.0 ml of tween 80 in distilled water .
as a control , crystalline cellulose was digested instead of the persimmon non - extractable fraction. and equal parts of fecal suspension was incubated for 24 h under anaerobic conditions .
2.5.2 orac assays of digested samples after each stage of the digestion process , samples were extracted with the same volume of meoh using a stirrer and were then centrifuged at 1580xg for 5 min at room temperature .
this procedure was repeated three times and supernatants were collected and evaporated in vacuo to obtain samples for orac assays .
the non - extractable fraction of dried persimmon was subjected to four processes of in vitro digestion and orac values were estimated for each stage at three times ( table 4 ) .

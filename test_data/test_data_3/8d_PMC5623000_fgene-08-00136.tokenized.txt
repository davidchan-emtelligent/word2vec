we present an ultrafast method for comparing personal genomes .
we transform the standard genome representation ( lists of variants relative to a reference ) into " genome fingerprints " via locality sensitive hashing .
the resulting genome fingerprints can be meaningfully compared even when the input data were obtained using different sequencing technologies , processed using different pipelines , represented in different data formats and relative to different reference versions .
furthermore , genome fingerprints are robust to up to 30 % missing data .
because of their reduced size , computation on the genome fingerprints is fast and requires little memory .
for example , we could compute all - against - all pairwise comparisons among the 2504 genomes in the 1000 genomes data set in 67 s at high quality ( 21 mus per comparison , on a single processor ) , and achieved a lower quality approximation in just 11 s. efficient computation enables scaling up a variety of important genome analyses , including quantifying relatedness , recognizing duplicative sequenced genomes in a set , population reconstruction , and many others .
the original genome representation cannot be reconstructed from its fingerprint , effectively decoupling genome comparison from genome interpretation ; the method thus has significant implications for privacy - preserving genome analytics .
computational genomics algorithms genome comparison study design population genetics privacy national institutes of health10.13039 / 100000002u54 eb020406 introduction personal genome sequences contain the information required for assessing genetic risks , matching genetic backgrounds between cases and controls in medical research , and detecting duplicate individuals or close relatives for medical , legal , or historical reasons .
research purposes served by personal genome sequencing include classifying individuals by population , reconstructing human history , assessing and controlling the quality of the sequence information itself , computing kinship matrices to support genome - wide association studies , and combining data sets for meta - analysis .
many of these applications involve comparison of two or more personal genomes .
however , the size , complexity , and diversity of representations in which they are stored makes comparison of personal genomes in their existing forms error - prone and slow , and therefore challenging to scale from pairs to the hundreds , thousands , or millions of individuals we will soon wish to compare in order to provide improved , personalized medical care .
comparison of personal genomes requires cross - referencing on a very large number ( potentially millions ) of variants , most of which are single - nucleotide variants ( snvs ) ; this process can be slow enough to make the computation of all pairwise comparisons take a prohibitive amount of time .
current approaches to rapid genome comparison rely on severely limiting the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps , defined as snvs with population frequency above 1 %) to compare .
a carefully curated set of 24 autosomal exome snps ( pengelly et al. , 2013 ) captures up to 38 bits of information per genome and thus limits utility to establishing identity and is susceptible to failure when data are partially missing .
a larger set of 1500 pre - selected snps has been used to match genomes directly from bam files ( wang et al. , 2016 ) , with the requirement that these be mapped to the same reference genome .
similarly , focusing on tens of thousands of pre - selected snvs enables multiple fast quality control computations in pedigrees ( pedersen and quinlan , 2017 ) .
another powerful strategy involves deep compression of the data , coupled with advanced algorithms for fast querying and retrieval ( layer et al. , 2016 ; tatwawadi et al. , 2016 ) .
the recent unicorn method enables independent mapping of individuals onto ancestry spaces based on detailed maps of minor allele frequency distributions ( bodea et al. , 2016 ) .
these strategies offer better speed at the expense of limited applicability , severely reduced accuracy , or strong reliance on detailed prior knowledge about the population being studied .
perhaps more importantly , the diversity of representations of personal genomes remains a problem for each of these methods , which must translate variants represented in different ways to a common representation in order to assemble the data to compare .
this diversity of representations arises from the variety of technologies used to determine personal genomes , their processing with diverse software pipelines and their representation relative to multiple versions of the reference genome .
we explore each of these below .
the billions of base pairs in an individual 's genome can be assayed using a variety of techniques , the most complete of which is whole - genome sequencing ( wgs ) .
several wgs technologies have been used to determine individual genomic sequences , differing in experimental protocols and in specific parameters such as read length and error tolerances ; the resulting data are processed using diverse computational pipelines .
each technology brings a different set of observational biases and error modalities ; the resulting observations are expressed in a diversity of " native " vendor - specific file formats , and translated to one or more standard formats [ e.g. , variant call format ( vcf )] in a variety of ways , leading to a bewildering diversity of flavors of semi - standard formats .
the resulting sequence is compactly represented as a list of differences ( variants ) from a reference genome .
due to the ongoing progress in improving the quality of the human reference genome , there are now several different versions ( also known as " freezes ") in use .
to date , many thousands of personal genomes have been ascertained , most of them expressed relative to the grch37 ( also known as " hg19 ") and grch38 (" hg38 ") freezes , though much legacy data exist using grch36 (" hg18 ") coordinates and even earlier versions .
the position of a genomic variant depends on the reference version used : from one genome freeze to another , typically only the position of each variant along the chromosome changes , though in a small fraction of the cases a variant may be located in different chromosomes .
any two genomes of interest may be expressed relative to different reference genomes , necessitating conversion prior to comparison and analysis .
even relative to the same reference version , a variant may have more than one representation , necessitating additional conversion steps potentially leading to errors .
each chromosome has multiple names ( e.g. , " nc _ 000003.12 ," " chr3 " or just " 3 " are all used refer to the third largest human chromosome ) , and different representations count the first nucleotide of each chromosome as position 0 or 1 .
even with the same naming and numbering conventions , some variants can be expressed in more than one way , requiring normalization ( tan et al. , 2015 ) .
sequencing the same genome using different technologies can yield differing results , as each technology has its own biases .
even when using the same technology , reference and encoding , sequencing the same genome repeatedly can give somewhat different results due to the stochastic nature of genome sequencing , to batch effects , or to differences in the computational pipelines used .
looking to the future , additional ( long - read ) technologies will enable de novo genome assembly to become commonplace ; the reference genome representation will change to a graph format , further breaking the concept of absolute coordinates ; and the number of genomes available will soon be in the millions .
these trends will deepen , not lessen the complexity of genome comparison .
we present here a new , rapid method for summarizing personal genomes that does not require knowledge of the technology , reference and encoding used , and yields " genome fingerprints " that can be used to facilitate many standard problems in genomics .
thanks to their reduced size , computation on the genome fingerprints is orders of magnitude faster and requires little memory , enabling comparison of much larger sets of genomes .
no individual variants or other detailed features of the personal genome can be reconstructed from the fingerprint , thereby allowing private information to be more closely guarded and protected by decoupling genome comparison from genome interpretation .
fingerprints of different sizes allow balancing the speed and accuracy of the comparisons , and due to the high value of estimating relatedness , the potential applications of genome fingerprinting range from basic science ( study design , population studies ) to personalized medicine , forensics and genealogy research .
methods overview our algorithm summarizes a personal genome as a " fingerprint " ( figure 1 ) .
conceptually , any variant - oriented representation of a personal genome ( e.g. , a vcf file or vendor - specific format , regardless of encoding or reference genome used ) includes a list of variants , including their position and reference and alternative alleles , sorted by position .
a " raw " fingerprint is a tally of consecutive biallelic snv pairs grouped on a combination of these two attributes .
we then normalize the raw fingerprint to account for systematic differences in frequency between groups by allele and by position .
the resulting " normalized " fingerprint preserves differences at the species level , e.g. , between individuals from different populations .
averaging the normalized fingerprints of the individuals in a population yields a " population " fingerprint , which can be subtracted from an individual 's normalized fingerprint to produce a " population - adjusted " fingerprint suitable for more sensitive detection of related genomes .
figure 1 overview of method .
pairs of consecutive snvs in the input file ( upper right ) are encoded into a table ( upper left ) by snv key and by distance .
a section of the table , informative about technology , is segregated (" close " matrix , lower left ) .
the rest of the table is folded using the modulo function to generate the raw fingerprint (" raw " matrix , lower center ) , which is then normalized and adjusted to the closest population ( lower right ) .
computation of raw fingerprints the first stage in computing genome fingerprints yields a " raw " fingerprint , a 144 x l table of snv pair counts ( l , the fingerprint length , is the main parameter of the method , defaulting to 20 ) .
we classify each pair of consecutive snvs by the combination of reference and alternate alleles at both snvs : this information determines the row in the table .
we also consider the distance between the snvs : this information determines the column in the table .
when studying genomes produced using complete genomics and illumina technologies , we observed differences in the distribution of distances between consecutive snvs , for short distances ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
these differences largely reflect each vendor pipeline 's encoding of multi - nucleotide variants ; some pipelines represent these as individual snvs , potentially leading to interpretation errors ( wei et al. , 2015 ) .
we thus exclude snv pairs that are separated by fewer than c base pairs ( defaulting to 20 ) from the final fingerprint .
to avoid technology - specific artifacts , we recommend c at least 5 ( see below ) .
to compute a raw fingerprint : ( 1 ) parse the autosomes in the personal genome ( e.g. , from a vcf file ) to identify biallelic snvs as variants with reference allele of length 1 and single alternate allele of length 1 , both in the case - insensitive alphabet [ a c g t ] .
ignore all other types of variants : two biallelic snvs separated by other types of variants are still considered consecutive .
( 2 ) for each snv , join its reference and alternative alleles into one of 12 possible snv keys .
for example , reference allele " g " and alternative allele " a " form key " ga . "
( 3 ) join the keys of consecutive snvs on the same chromosome to form one of 144 possible snv pair keys ; for example , consecutive snvs with keys " ga " and " tc " form the snv pair key " gatc . "
( 4 ) compute the number of base pairs between the two snvs ( the " distance " between the snvs along the reference genome ) .
if this distance is smaller than c , increment by one the corresponding value in the [ 144 x c ] " close " matrix ( figure 1 ) , and skip the next steps .
( 5 ) compute a reduced distance as the distance between the two snvs , modulo the l .
( 6 ) increment by one the corresponding value in the [ 144 x l ] " raw " matrix .
normalization of fingerprints the second stage in computing genome fingerprints performs a normalization of the raw fingerprint to account for the different frequencies of transitions and transversions , distance and parameter effects ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
the normalization is performed in two steps : ( 1 ) normalization by distance : subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation of each column .
( 2 ) normalization by snv pair key : subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation of each row .
the normalized fingerprints do not show any remaining structure ( supplementary figure 3 ) .
normalizing fingerprints in the reverse order ( first by snv pair key , then by distance ) fails to correct for the internal structure of raw fingerprints ( supplementary figure 4 ) .
population fingerprints we compute a population fingerprint as the average of the normalized fingerprints from the individuals in the population .
these fingerprints must have been computed using the same parameters ( c and l ) .
adjustment to population we compute a population - adjusted fingerprint for an individual by subtracting a population fingerprint from the normalized fingerprint of that individual .
the individual fingerprint and the population fingerprint must have been computed using the same parameters ( c and l ) .
similar to normalized fingerprints , population - adjusted fingerprints show no internal structure ( supplementary figure 5 ) .
fingerprint comparison to compare two fingerprints , concatenate the rows of each fingerprint matrix into a vector and compute the spearman correlation between the two vectors .
the fingerprints to be compared thus have to be computed using the same parameter l. this same procedure is appropriate for comparing two normalized fingerprints or two population adjusted fingerprints , whether adjusted to the same or different populations .
binary fingerprints we also evaluated a minimal version of the genome fingerprints , in the shape of a binary string of length 144 , as follows ( supplementary figure 6 ) .
we ( a ) compute a raw fingerprint matrix with l = 2 , and ( b ) for each row in the matrix , corresponding to a snv pair key , add to the binary fingerprint a 1 if the value of the second column is larger than the value in the first column .
there is no need to normalize binary fingerprints .
to compare two binary fingerprints , we count how many bits are identical between the two , divide by the number of bits ( 144 ) and square the resulting fraction .
evaluation of the robustness of genome fingerprints different reference versions to evaluate the robustness of the fingerprinting method to different versions of the reference genome , we computed fingerprints ( l = 20 and binary ) for a set of 69 genomes sequenced by complete genomics , inc .
[ a ] ; these genomes were mapped to both grch36 ( hg18 ) and grch37 ( hg19 ) .
we then computed all pairwise correlations , which include ( a ) each genome on both references , ( b ) combinations of different genomes on the same reference , and ( c ) combinations of different genomes with different references .
format and normalization to evaluate the robustness of the fingerprinting method to transformation from vendor - specific formats to standard representations , we studied 2436 cgi genomes delivered in " var " format and 1618 cgi genomes delivered in " mastervar " format .
the var format reports each allelic observation in a separate line , while the mastervar format represents each locus in one line ( in similarity with the vcf format ) .
we used custom parsers to transform these vendor - specific genome representations to vcf format , and normalized them using vt normalize ( tan et al. , 2015 ) .
we then compared genome fingerprints computed from the original ( var or mastervar ) representations and from the normalized vcf representations .
we performed these computations with l = 20 and with binary fingerprints .
significant filtering and post - processing to evaluate the robustness of the fingerprinting method to complex post - processing procedures , we studied 154 genomes from the 1000 genomes project for which individual wgs data are available from the international genome sample resource [ b ] .
the genomes were analyzed using complete genomics' analysis pipeline versions 2.2.0.19 through 2.2.0.26 and reported in mastervar format .
we compared for each genome fingerprints computed from the mastervar representation and from the version extracted from the multi - sample vcfs in release 20130502 ( filenames : all.chrnn.phase3 _ shapeit2 _ mvncall _ integrated _ v5.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz ) .
we performed these computations with l = 20 , l = 200 , and binary fingerprints .
sequencing technology effects to evaluate the robustness of the fingerprinting method to differences between technologies , we computed fingerprints for several versions of the " platinum " na12878 genome , some of them sourced from the genome in a bottle consortium ( downloaded from [ c ]) .
these assemblies were sequenced using multiple versions of cgi 's technology and illumina , processed using various pipeline versions , mapped to grch36 , grch37 , and grch38 ( figure 2 ) .
we performed these comparisons with l = 5 , l = 20 , l = 120 , and binary fingerprints .

missing data and added noise to evaluate the robustness of the fingerprinting method to missing data , we performed a simulation in which we degraded a genome to increasing degrees and compared the resulting fingerprints to the original .
we computed a series of fingerprints for the same genome by varying the probability of not observing each individual variant , excluding 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 45 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 95 , and 99 % of the variants at random ( figure 3 ) .
we performed this simulation with l = 10 , l = 20 , l = 50 , l = 120 , and binary fingerprints .
figure 3 robustness to missing data and to added noise .
we simulated increasing fractions of missing data ( a ) and to increasing probability of added noise ( b ) and computed the correlation between the resulting fingerprint and the fingerprint derived from the full data .
for fingerprints with l = 10 , l = 20 , l = 50 , and l = 120 , the method was robust to up to 35 % data loss and up to 15 % added noise .
the binary fingerprint was robust to up to 10 % data loss and less than 5 % added noise .
similarly , we evaluated robustness to added noise .
we simulated noise from sequencing errors ( false positives ) by adding an additional , intervening spurious variant between each observed variant pair , with probabilities as in the missing data simulation .
pedigree study we studied wgs data from 35 individuals in a large family ( figure 4 ) .
all genomes were sequenced by complete genomics , inc. from blood ( n = 25 ) or saliva ( n = 10 ) samples , and processed using pipeline version 2.5.0.20 .
the genome data and a description of the family pedigree were donated by the private family .
we categorized all pairwise relationships within the family as sibling , parent / child , half - sibling , aunt / uncle , grandparent , cousin , second cousin , second cousin once removed , unrelated , and other .
the last category included more complex relations , e.g. , child and grandchild of half - siblings .
we computed for each individual a series of genome fingerprints using l in the range 2 - 200 .
for each l we computed all pairwise correlations , then computed their average and standard deviation stratified by the relationship categories listed above .

population reconstruction we computed fingerprints ( l = 20 , l = 120 , and binary ) for each of the 2504 genomes in the 1000 genomes project data set from the version extracted from the multi - sample vcfs in release 20130502 ( filenames : all.chrnn.phase3 _ shapeit2 _ mvncall _ integrated _ v5.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz ) .
for comparison , we analyzed the same data by principal components analysis ( pca ) as follows .
we identified snps with a minor allele frequency of 5 % or more , removed snps in complete linkage disequilibrium with a snp to the left ( i.e. , a smaller chromosomal position ) , retained 5 % at random ( 298,454 snps ) and counted occurrences of the minor allele ( 0 , 1 , or 2 ) in each genome to form a 2504 x 298,454 genotype matrix m. we performed pca using the r function call prcomp ( m , center = true , scale = true ) and t - distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t - sne ) using the r package rtsne with perplexity = 25 and max _ iter = 500 ( figure 5 ) .

we computed fingerprints ( l = 120 ) and analyzed using pca as above ( figure 6b ) .
evaluation of fingerprints for population classification we computed a population fingerprint for each of the annotated populations studied by the 1000 genomes project .
to identify the population closest to each individual , we compared each individual 's normalized fingerprint to the population fingerprints ( using spearman correlation , as described for comparing individual fingerprints ) .
each individual was considered classified as belonging to the closest population .
to avoid bias , we excluded each individual from the computation of their own population fingerprint .
population - adjusted fingerprints we computed a population - adjusted fingerprint for each individual in the 1000 genomes data set by subtracting the population fingerprint ( excluding the individual ) from the individual 's normalized fingerprint .
we computed all pairwise spearman correlations and identified outliers using the absolute deviation around the median ( wilcox , 2016 ) with false discovery rate of 5 % .
to compute kinship coefficients , we identified snps with a minor allele frequency of 5 % or more , removed snps in complete linkage disequilibrium with a snp to the left ( i.e. , a smaller chromosomal position ) , retained 5 % at random ( 324,313 snps ) , reformatted using vcftools ( danecek et al. , 2011 ) and plink ( purcell et al. , 2007 ) , and computed kinship coefficients using king ( manichaikul et al. , 2010 ) .
we obtained previously reported close relationships in the 1000 genomes data set ( gazal et al. , 2015 ) as computed using relpair ( epstein et al. , 2000 ) .
results a novel genome encoding method we developed a novel algorithm for computing " fingerprints " from genome data ; the algorithm is akin to locality - sensitive hashing ( indyk and motwani , 1998 ) .
these fingerprints are rapidly computed , only need to be computed once per genome ( not once per comparison ) , and can be rapidly compared to determine whether two genome sequences are derived from the same individual , closely related individuals , or unrelated individuals .
moreover , the original genome representation cannot be reconstructed from the fingerprint , and fingerprints can be shared when privacy concerns prevent sharing the genome itself .
importantly , the fingerprints can be computed starting from any of several file formats , with a variety of encodings and relative to any reference version , and the resulting fingerprints are directly comparable without further conversion .
based on characteristics of consecutive pairs of snvs ( see section " methods ") , our algorithm computes two small matrices of numbers for each genome ( figure 1 ) , one of which (" close ") holds potentially useful information about the technology used to generate the genome , and the other (" raw ") represents the genome itself .
the latter is then normalized and potentially adjusted to the relevant population fingerprint .
each of these matrix versions has its own utility .
the main parameter of our algorithm , l , determines the size of the fingerprint .
smaller fingerprints ( e.g. , l = 20 ) are useful for fast genome comparisons to determine identity , while larger fingerprints ( e.g. , l = 120 , l = 200 ) retain more information and better support detailed analyses like population reconstruction .
comparison of genome fingerprints two fingerprint matrices can be easily compared by first serializing each fingerprint into a vector of numbers ( see section " methods ") and then computing a correlation value between the two vectors .
the correlation reflects the overall similarity between the two genomes being compared : identical input genomes yield perfect correlation .
based on our experiments , detailed below , comparison of two versions of the same genome typically display correlations above 0.75 , and lower correlation values reflect various degrees of similarity that inform about family relatedness and population of origin .
various cutoff values can be used to determine the degree of relatedness represented by each correlation level ; these cutoffs may depend on the parameters used for constructing fingerprints , and can be determined empirically through family studies as described below .
a minimal fingerprint we further sought to create a minimal genome fingerprint .
using the smallest meaningful table ( l = 2 ) , we created a fingerprint of just 144 bits for each genome .
each bit represents , for each of the 144 possible snv pair keys ( e.g. , " gagt ") , whether the distance ( the number of intervening base pairs ) between the consecutive snvs is more frequently an odd or an even number .
this simple function yields a " binary barcode " of a genome ( supplementary figure 6 ) with negligible storage and memory footprints , trivially comparable to similarly computed " barcodes " by counting binary matches .
computation on genome fingerprints is fast computation of genome fingerprints is very fast , typically requiring 15 - 45 s per genome , depending on the file format .
the computation requires a single - pass read of the genome and depends principally on the time it takes to read the file ( i.e. , it is " i / o bound ") .
it is also trivially parallelizable : computation of one genome fingerprint does not depend on the results of similar computations for other genomes .
it is also possible to compute partial raw fingerprints from sections of the genome , e.g. , individual chromosomes ; such partial fingerprints can then be combined by simple summation , yielding the raw fingerprint for the whole genome .
this is particularly useful when the data are represented in separate multi - sample files per chromosome , as is the case for the 1000 genomes data set .
thanks to the small size of the fingerprint matrices , fingerprint comparisons are extremely fast .
we performed all - against - all comparisons in the set of 2,504 genomes from the 1000 genomes project .
the 3.1 million comparisons required 67 s ( 21.3 mus per comparison ) with l = 120 , and 11 s ( 3.53 mus per comparison ) with l = 20 .
fingerprint comparisons are also independent and trivially parallelizable .
genome fingerprints are robust fingerprints are robust to reference versions mapping raw sequence data to different reference versions can yield disparate variant calls .
the absolute coordinates for most observed variants will differ between references ; a fraction of the variants will differ also in other aspects including reference allele , variant allele and even chromosome assignment and strand .
we studied a set of 69 genomes that were mapped to two reference versions and evaluated the effect of reference version on fingerprint comparison. with l = 20 , the spearman correlation between fingerprints derived from genomes mapped to grch36 and grch37 ranged from 0.989 to 0.991 , while fingerprints derived from different genomes in this set ranged from 0.222 to 0.685 ( see example in figure 2 ) .
these differences are much larger than the standard deviations observed for each relatedness level ( supplementary figure 8 and sections below ) .
binary fingerprints yielded lower correlations that nevertheless clearly separated self - comparisons ( 0.853 - 0.986 ) from comparisons of different individuals ( 0.243 - 0.683 ) .
genomes mapped to different references therefore yield highly comparable fingerprints .
fingerprints are robust to format differences genome sequencing vendors may deliver results in non - standard file formats that best convey technology - specific characteristics of the data ; the variants themselves may be represented in inconsistent ways .
considering two vendor - specific file formats ( complete genomics' var and mastervar ) , we evaluated the effect on fingerprinting of standardizing the genome data representation by transforming to the standard vcf format and by normalization of variants ( tan et al. , 2015 ). with l = 20 , the correlation between fingerprints derived from var files and from their normalized vcf counterparts was 0.9911 +/ - 0.0008 .
for mastervar files , the correlation was 0.9982 +/ - 0.0015 .
binary fingerprints yielded marginally lower correlations : 0.9262 +/ - 0.0313 for var files and 0.9688 +/ - 0.0211 for mastervar files .
we found that this transformation yields nearly identical fingerprints .
fingerprints are robust to complex post - processing the 1000 genomes project applied a number of post - processing steps to the collection of 2504 genomes to normalize variant calls and exclude spurious or unreliable variants .
thus , for each genome in the data set there are at least two versions : the initial , unprocessed individual genome , and the harmonized version in the context of the large study .
we evaluated whether fingerprint comparison is robust to this complex post - processing procedure ( see example in figure 2 ). with l = 20 , the correlation between initial and post - processed versions was 0.798 +/ - 0.010 .
we observed nearly identical results with l = 200 : 0.798 +/ - 0.008 .
the lowest observed correlation for an individual genome was 0.776 , well above the correlations observed for different individuals , even those closely related .
as expected , binary fingerprints were more strongly affected by the post - processing procedure , yielding correlations of 0.660 +/ - 0.057 ( supplementary figure 7 ) .
here , the lowest observed correlation for an individual was 0.482 , significantly below the highest correlation observed between binary fingerprints of two related individuals ( 0.683 ) .
therefore , binary fingerprint comparisons for the purpose of determining identity between two genomes may frequently lead to false negatives in the presence of complex post - processing of genome data .
we observed no false positive identifications using the 0.75 cutoff , though this could conceivably happen with much larger data sets .
fingerprints are robust to technology differences we compared fingerprints computed from various versions of the same genome ( na12878 ) as ascertained using different technologies , mapped with different pipelines and using different references ( figure 2 ) .
using fingerprints with l >= 20 , all comparisons yielded correlations higher than 0.8 .
shorter fingerprints ( l = 5 ) yielded correlations above 0.75 ( not shown ) .
as expected , binary fingerprints were more sensitive to technology differences .
fingerprints are robust in the presence of sequencing errors we evaluated , by simulation , whether fingerprint comparison is robust to missing data and to added noise .
for a variety of fingerprint sizes , we degraded a personal genome by excluding ( prior to computing fingerprints ) a fraction of the variants ( false negatives ) , and alternatively by adding spurious variant observations ( false positives ) .
for most fingerprint sizes , we observed a monotonic and equivalent decrease in spearman correlation between the degraded genome fingerprints and the original , undegraded genome fingerprint .
given the 0.75 lowest correlation observed for different versions of the same genome , we conclude that the fingerprinting method is robust to up to 35 % missing data and up to 15 % added noise ( figure 3 ) .
as expected , the less informative binary fingerprint is less robust ( up to 10 % missing data , and to less than 5 % added noise ) .
all these error levels are significantly higher than what is typically observed in genome sequencing ; this is consistent with the high correlations observed between technical replicates ( figure 2 ) .
fingerprint similarity reflects degree of relationship we compared pairwise genome fingerprint correlations with known family relationships in a large pedigree ( figure 4 ) .
the family relationships spanned the range from close ( e.g. , siblings ) to distant ( e.g. , second cousins once removed ) and also included unrelated individuals ( joining the family by marriage ) .
we observed that fingerprint correlations decrease with increasing degree of relationship , from 0.62 +/ - 0.031 for full siblings to 0.41 +/ - 0.007 for unrelated individuals .
this demonstrates that our genome fingerprinting method is locality - sensitive .
we also observed that l >= 20 is sufficient for distinguishing most relationship levels on average .
larger fingerprints have lower standard deviations ( supplementary figure 8 ) , improving resolution and the confidence of close relationship .
the genomes of all individuals in this pedigree were sequenced using the same technology and processed using similar pipeline versions and the same reference version ; this setup is typical for research studies .
combining data obtained using multiple technologies and processing pipelines could reduce the ability to confidently distinguish between relationship levels. of note , fingerprints derived from siblings tend to be more highly correlated than fingerprints of parents and their offspring ( 0.62 +/ - 0.031 vs. 0.58 +/ - 0.007 , respectively ) .
in both cases the degree of relationship is the same , but the identity by descent ( ibd ) pattern differs : parents and offspring share 100 % of the genome in ibd1 state , while siblings share ( on average ) 50 % of the genome in ibd1 state and 25 % in ibd2 state .
this increases the probability that sibling pairs will share heterozygous variants , especially heterozygous rare variants , as compared with parent / child pairs .
for similar reasons , fingerprints of half siblings are more correlated than fingerprints of relatives of the same average degree ( grandparental and avuncular relationships ) .
fast reconstruction of population structure we tested the utility of genome fingerprints for population studies .
we computed fingerprints for the 2504 individuals from 1000 genomes project and used pca and t - sne to reconstruct the known population structure ( figure 5 ) in a fraction of the time required to perform the same task using standard methods and with much smaller memory requirements .
the quality of the reconstruction depended on fingerprint size : fingerprints with l = 120 yielded excellent population structure reconstruction and fingerprints with l = 20 yielded good separation at the continental level .
pca applied to fingerprints of different values of l provided results highly correlated with results from pca applied to variants , with convergence to the same principal component axes as either the number of variants or the l increased .
for a sufficient amount of data in either form , correlation between corresponding principal components was > 0.99 for the first 5 to the first 10 components .
this strongly suggests pca of either kind of data provides equivalent information regarding population structure .
importantly , the population reconstruction workflow using fingerprints is simple and requires no prior knowledge .
the standard workflow requires creating multi - sample vcfs ( which in turn requires normalizing variants ) , filtering out unreliable variants ( which requires prior knowledge ) , filtering by allele frequency ( requiring previous knowledge of population frequencies ) , paying attention to linkage disequilibrium , making assumptions about variants not observed in some samples and , finally , selecting a suitably sized subset of variants to balance resolution with memory and computational requirements .
in some cases , these technical requirements can be quite severe , e.g. , limiting the set of variants to a few thousands for t - sne analysis ( li et al. , 2017 ) .
in contrast , using genome fingerprints it is possible to reconstruct population structure by computing fingerprints directly from the unprocessed individual genomes and combining the fingerprints into a matrix ready for analysis with pca , t - sne or any other method of choice .
to test the general applicability of the method , we similarly studied 453 sheep ( ovis aries ) genomes [ d ] and 3000 rice ( oryza sativa ) genomes ( the 3000 rice genome project , 2014 ) .
these two data sets are available in different formats : the sheep genome data as multi - sample vcfs , while the rice genomes are provided as individual sample vcfs .
we computed genome fingerprints with l = 120 and reconstructed population structure for each of these model species ( figure 6 ) .
while it took many hours to download the sheep and rice genome data ( 14 and 30 h , respectively ) , fingerprint computation took just 1.5 h for the multi - sample sheep genome vcf and 55 min for the single - sample rice vcfs .
once the genome fingerprints were computed , the complete population reconstruction and visualization workflow took minutes to run (~ 5 min for sheep , ~ 15 min for rice ) , including the pca component ( 15 s for sheep , 9 min for rice ) .
these efforts did not require any prior knowledge of ovine ( or rice ) genome structure , linkage maps , population frequencies of variants , or metadata about the samples .
utility for fast and simple population assignment individuals from the same population share some evolutionary history , and therefore some of the snv pairs counted in computing genome fingerprints .
it is thus useful to summarize the fingerprints of a population , both to estimate the " center " of the population 's fingerprints and their variability around that center ( population diversity ) .
such " population fingerprints " have a variety of uses , including population assignment for individuals .
we implemented a simple and very rapid method in which we first compute fingerprints ( l = 120 ) for each population in the 1000 genomes data set by simply averaging the fingerprints of the genomes in each population .
we then compute the correlation between the fingerprint of a query genome and the fingerprint of each population : the genome is assigned to the population with which it is most strongly correlated .
we tested this method by " leave one out " cross - validation .
the correct population was identified as the best match for 2047 of 2504 query genomes ( 82 % of cases ) .
some of the populations in the 1000 genomes data set are very closely related and difficult to separate ; for many practical purposes ( e.g. , selecting appropriate allele frequencies ) using such closely related populations yields equivalent results .
accepting the second or third best population matches increased the success rate to 96 and 98 % , respectively .
at the continental resolution ( five regions : afr , amr , eas , eur , and sas ) , the best match was correct for all but 42 admixed amr genomes .
utility of population - adjusted fingerprints fingerprints can be manipulated in a familiar way to perform different distance - based analyses .
population fingerprints , for example , are simple averages of a group that capture the features common to the group with respect to distance , but without corresponding interpretations that could be used for racial profiling or stereotyping .
population adjusted fingerprints allow analysis of relationships within a population , beyond the features shared among the population .
this allows close relationships to be distinguished from membership in the same population and may help increase resolution of population structure reconstruction .
we adjusted the l = 120 fingerprints for the 2504 individuals in the 1000 genomes data set relative to their stated population of origin , performed all pairwise comparisons , compared with kinship coefficients computed using king ( manichaikul et al. , 2010 ) and with previously reported relationships ( gazal et al. , 2015 ) computed using relpair ( epstein et al. , 2000 ) ( figure 7 ). of note , these correlation values among population adjusted fingerprints are not comparable with those observed among normalized fingerprints in the family study ( figure 4 ) .
the similarity between unrelated individuals derived from the same population ( e.g. , figure 4 ) is removed by adjustment to the population average .
thus , population - adjusted fingerprints for unrelated individuals show no significant correlation .

we observed 143 pairs of individuals from the same population with correlations higher than expected ( at 5 % false discovery rate ) and two outlier pairs linking individuals of the itu and stu populations ( supplementary table 1 ) , consistent with previous reports ( gazal et al. , 2015 ) .
the highly correlated pairs correspond to a variety of degrees of relationship , from full siblings to cousins .
in several cases they form networks of related individuals , e.g. , a gujarati indian trio with a cousin of one of the parents ( figure 7 , upper inset ) and a sri lankan tamil pair of full siblings and three cousins ( figure 7 , lower inset ) .
for related pairs , fingerprint correlation levels are correlated with the kinship coefficient as computed using king ( figure 7 ) .
the fingerprint correlation method can further distinguish between full sibling and parent / offspring relationships .
many more cousin pairs are clearly distinguished from unrelated pairs by their fingerprint correlations than by their kinship coefficient values .
for unrelated pairs , fingerprint correlations are narrowly distributed around 0 ( no correlation ) , while the kinship coefficients range from ~ 0.1 down to - 0.4 .
discussion we have presented a novel algorithm for computing " fingerprints " of individual genomes , and various examples of their potential applications .
genome fingerprints are reduced representations that retain information about distances ( between genomes ) but not functional features , enabling ultrafast comparison of genomes .
importantly , the fingerprints need to be computed just once per genome , not once per comparison .
they can also be computed directly from any representation of the genome , regardless of technology , reference version , formatting and encoding choices , and even significant levels of missing data and added noise .
these features provide for the first time the ability to rapidly compute the level of similarity between genomes regardless of such representational differences .
we described an implementation of the method for whole - genome data and various aspects of comparing whole - genome fingerprints , pairwise and in large sets .
fingerprints can similarly be computed for exome data .
the fingerprint computed from an individual 's exome would not be directly comparable to the fingerprint derived from the same individual 's whole genome ; it is though possible and very efficient to approximate exome data from whole - genome data , by simple subsetting using bedtools ( quinlan and hall , 2010 ) .
our current implementation of pairwise comparison of genomes via fingerprints takes microseconds per comparison ; using multithreading or specialized hardware acceleration could potentially significantly improve performance .
these speeds are already orders of magnitude faster than afforded by current methods , and enable orders of magnitude more comparisons to be routinely performed .
as expected from the highly lossy data reduction involved in generating genome fingerprints , their comparison for various applications yields results that are somewhat inferior to direct computation on the entire dataset of all observed variants .
the fast approximation afforded by genome fingerprints will be good enough for some applications , and will help prioritize more detailed computations where precise results are required .
widespread adoption of this methodology could revolutionize the field of comparative genomics by enabling comparisons on a scale not now attempted due to the time and effort required .
for example , all - against - all pairwise comparisons of a million genomes could be performed with l = 20 in 20 cpu days ( or under 1 day with minimal parallelization ) , followed by more refined comparison of the subset of genome pairs of interest .
we have shown that regardless of the technology , genome freeze , or encoding used for specific personal genomes , the corresponding fingerprints enable rapid testing of whether two genome representations are derived from the same person or from closely related individuals , rapid identification of the closest among a specified set of candidate populations , and acceleration of population structure studies .
genome fingerprints are also lightweight and restricted to distance information , and therefore suitable for databasing on a broader scale than the personal genomes themselves .
such databases would enable rapid testing of whether a new personal genome has already been observed , rapidly ensuring that a data set includes only unrelated individuals , and rapid testing for the presence of shared genomes in two or more studies , all of which are common steps in the planning and construction of cohorts of genomes for more sensitive , functional analysis .
distances between fingerprints also provide an unbiased scale for selecting pairs of individuals at comparable distances , for example , to select individuals from a control set matched to a set of cases at a consistent evolutionary distance .
genome fingerprints are highly robust to a variety of important technical issues , including different reference versions , variant normalization and post - processing , different sequencing technologies , and different variant sampling efficiencies ( missing data ) .
we observed that significant post - processing of genome data in a large cohort , as done by the 1000 genomes project , can lead to reduced similarities with the unprocessed versions of the same genomes .
several processing steps may contribute to this effect : exclusion of problematic " blacklisted " regions , imputation of missing values , changes in genotypes determined through " joint calling ," and the increased chance of observing multi - allelic variants - - which are excluded from our analysis .
we evaluated the value of the most compact form of fingerprint , binary fingerprints .
despite their simplicity and compactness , binary fingerprints are typically sufficient to establish whether two genome representations are derived from the same individual , and even to distinguish between closely related and unrelated individuals ; however , they do not retain enough information to make these determinations when comparing mixtures of unprocessed and highly post - processed versions of genomes .
our fingerprinting algorithm is a fully deterministic form of locality - sensitive hashing ( indyk and motwani , 1998 ) , a class of algorithms which has been successfully applied to large - scale sequence comparisons ( buhler , 2001 ) , protein classification ( caragea et al. , 2012 ) , metagenome clustering ( rasheed et al. , 2013 ) , and the detection of gene - gene interactions ( brinza et al. , 2010 ) .
locality sensitive hashing methods based on indexing substrings have been used to compare genomes , typically of different species , and other sequence data types. by encoding single - nucleotide differences from a reference sequence , our method focuses on representing distances among individuals of the same species , for whom the base ( reference ) sequence is identical and need not be indexed as k - mers .
accordingly , the main application of our method is to detect relationships at various levels - - from identity to population structure .
we chose to focus on the most common and well - defined type of genome variation - - snvs .
other types of variation , including short insertions and deletions ( indels ) , larger structural variants , and copy - number variants ) are significantly less common than snvs , and are frequently either represented differently in different genomes , not detected , or not reported : we therefore chose to exclude them for the sake of simplicity and consistency in analysis .
our results demonstrate that snv - based fingerprints contain enough information to support many genome comparison tasks ; the other types of variation are not necessary to estimate evolutionary distances within a species , and could be detrimental for the above reasons .
for each snv , we only consider the nature of the reference allele and the alternate allele as observed in the individual .
our current implementation considers only positions in which an alternate allele is observed , regardless of zygosity : heterozygous snvs and homozygous - alternate snvs are treated equally .
we also evaluated alternative versions of the method in which snvs with different zygosity are weighted differently .
some of these alternative versions will be useful in particular contexts , e.g. , for fingerprinting genomes in a fully reference - free fashion by considering only heterozygous snvs .
for each pair of consecutive snvs , we consider the distance separating them along the reference genome .
this is unaffected by any intervening indels or other complex variants in the individual .
we also chose to include only snvs observed in autosomes .
inclusion of variants in the sex chromosomes leads to distorted similarity values .
for example , due to shared variants on the x chromosome , a female child would appear to be more closely related to her mother than to her father , or to be as closely related to her grandfather as to her grandfather 's sister .
pairs of consecutive snps within 200 bp ( microhaplotype loci ) have been recognized as a powerful tool for individual identification , ancestry inference , determining family / clan relationships , and other forensic applications ( kidd et al. , 2013 ) .
our method collects from each genome all snv pairs regardless of distance and population frequency , thus extracting a phylogenetic signal in an unbiased way and without necessitating prior population knowledge .
most importantly , our algorithm successfully distributes this phylogenetic signal onto a matrix representation that preserves distances without preserving individual , functionally interpretable variants .
while some algorithmic aspects of our method may seem somewhat arbitrary , it is simple and efficient to compute .
prior applications of locality sensitive hashing to genomics have demonstrated the utility of quite arbitrary - seeming algorithms .
for example , the kernel of a locality sensitive hashing approach to genome - scale assembly of single - molecule sequencing data uses the xorshift pseudo - random number generator to transform k - mer hashes into comparable " sketches " ( berlin et al. , 2015 ) .
the focus on local patterns of snvs offers an additional advantage of our method .
to date , the reference genome has been represented as a collection of linear sequences ( chromosomes ) with absolute coordinates .
one disadvantage of this method is that the absolute coordinates change from version to version ; another is that the linear representation is not flexible enough to represent the rich diversity in structural variation observed within our species .
the genomics community is now developing a new , graph - based reference genome format , which will further devalue the use of global sequence coordinates as the method for matching sequence variants .
we expect that genome fingerprints can be computed from graph - based genome representations , which will be highly comparable to fingerprints we currently compute from linear - reference representations .
public sharing of genome data has been limited by multiple personal privacy and confidentiality considerations .
a central risk is the possibility of identifying genetic predispositions to certain diseases or other traits that could affect the individual 's ability to obtain or maintain employment , insurance or financial services , or may carry social stigma , or could lead to other negative effects .
quantifying this risk is difficult since the ability to interpret genomic variants will expand over time with additional research .
our method enables sharing enough information about a genome to enable the comparison tasks , without concomitantly revealing the information needed for predicting phenotype .
as such , our method decouples genome comparison from interpretation .
this property has important implications for privacy - preserving genome analytics .
identifying genomes harboring a specific variant can be of interest both in the presence of associated phenotype , as facilitated through the matchmaker exchange ( philippakis et al. , 2015 ) , or in its absence , to ascertain novelty and frequency ( glusman et al. , 2011 and the beacon network [ f ]) .
genome fingerprints support the complementary task of matchmaking via identification of closely related individuals , without exposing variant information , in similarity with the unicorn method ( bodea et al. , 2016 ) but with a much simpler algorithm that does not require extensive prior modeling of variant frequencies , nor samples to be expressed relative to the same reference .
genome fingerprints can furthermore be used to compare genomes from populations not previously studied .
finally , as growing contingents of private individuals get access to their own genetic data , there is increasing public interest in efficient and private analysis of personal genomic variation , not just for interpreting variants and their combinations , but also for identifying related individuals .
as such , our method has strong potential for empowering citizen science .

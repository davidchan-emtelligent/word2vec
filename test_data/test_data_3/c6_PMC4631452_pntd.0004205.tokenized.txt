interconversion of udp - glucose ( udp - glc ) and udp - galactose ( udp - gal ) by the udp - glc 4 ' - epimerase intimately connects the biosynthesis of these two nucleotide sugars .
their de novo biosynthesis involves transformation of glucose - 6 - phosphate into glucose - 1 - phosphate by the phosphoglucomutase and subsequent activation into udp - glc by the specific udp - glc pyrophosphorylase ( ugp ) .
besides ugp , leishmania parasites express an uncommon udp - sugar pyrophosphorylase ( usp ) able to activate both galactose - 1 - phosphate and glucose - 1 - phosphate in vitro .
targeted gene deletion of ugp alone was previously shown to principally affect expression of lipophosphoglycan , resulting in a reduced virulence .
since our attempts to delete both ugp and usp failed , deletion of ugp was combined with conditional destabilisation of usp to control the biosynthesis of udp - glc and udp - gal .
stabilisation of the enzyme produced by a single usp allele was sufficient to maintain the steady - state pools of these two nucleotide sugars and preserve almost normal glycoinositolphospholipids galactosylation , but at the apparent expense of lipophosphoglycan biosynthesis .
however , under destabilising conditions , the absence of both ugp and usp resulted in depletion of udp - glc and udp - gal and led to growth cessation and cell death , suggesting that either or both of these metabolites is / are essential .
author summary leishmaniases are a set of tropical and sub - tropical diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania .
they affect about 12 million people and cause a high morbidity .
since treatments against all forms of leishmaniasis are limited in number and efficacy , many efforts are made to identify potential drug targets and develop new therapies .
although considerable progress in genetic manipulation of leishmania parasites have been made , it remains difficult to study molecules or metabolic pathways essential for parasite viability and growth .
in the present work , we used a combination of gene deletion and conditional protein destabilization to demonstrate that biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar udp - glucose and its derivative udp - galactose is essential for parasite growth .
addition of a specific ligand to the culture medium of the engineered parasite protected the targeted enzyme from degradation and enabled cell growth and viability .
however , removal of the stabilizing compound led to depletion of udp - glucose and udp - galactose , growth arrest and cell death .
this work thus opens a new possibility for the study of essential proteins .

introduction leishmaniases are a set of tropical and sub - tropical diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania and transmitted by the bite of a sandfly .
the severity of the diseases depends on parasite species as well as the immune status of the host and ranges from self - healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral infections [ 1 ] .
according to the world health organisation , more than 1 million new cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and at least 30 000 deaths due to visceral leishmaniasis occur annually .
current treatments are far from ideal and the need to develop new treatments against leishmaniasis is generally recognised [ 2 ] .
advances in genetic manipulation of leishmania parasites has considerably facilitated the characterisation of metabolic processes and molecules important for parasite proliferation or virulence [ 3,4 ] .
nevertheless , the study of essential genes remains difficult since knockouts can only be performed if rescue strategies such as nutrient supplementation or ectopic gene copies can be used .
unfortunately , most leishmania species including l. major and l. donovani lack a functional rnai pathway [ 4 ] .
more recently , a system for conditional destabilisation of protein has been described .
this original system involves fusion of a mutated fk506 binding protein destabilising domain to the protein of interest and its stabilisation by addition of a specific ligand [ 5 ] .
however , this system has not yet been applied to essential proteins .
the promastigote stage of leishmania parasites synthesises a dense surface glycocalyx and secretes proteophosphoglycans ( ppgs ) that are both essential for its development and survival within the insect vector [ 6 ] .
the glycocalyx contains various gpi - anchored molecules including glycoproteins , lipophosphoglycans ( lpgs ) , proteophosphoglycans ( ppgs ) and the abundant glycoinositolphospholipids ( gipls ) [ 7,8 ] .
these surface and secreted glycoconjugates are rich in galactose and mannose and thus their biosynthesis requires an abundant supply of gdp - alpha - d - mannose ( gdp - man ) and udp - alpha - d - galactose ( udp - gal ) .
biosynthesis of gdp - man is required for formation of the glycocalyx [ 8 ] and for biosynthesis of the carbohydrate storage polymer beta1,2 - mannan [ 9 ] .
since these are essential for virulence , the enzymes involved in gdp - mannose biosynthesis are considered as potential drug targets [ 10 - 12 ] .
to address the importance of udp - gal biosynthesis in leishmania , we previously targeted the udp - glucose pyrophosphorylase ( ec 2.7.7.9 ) ( ugp ) [ 13 ] .
this enzyme catalyses the transformation of alpha - d - glucose - 1 - phosphate ( glc - 1p ) and utp into udp - glucose ( udp - glc ) [ 14 ] .
udp - glc can then be interconverted into udp - gal by the udp - glc 4 ' - epimerase .
unexpectedly , although reduced , galactosylation of the glycocalyx was not abolished in the ugp deficient mutant [ 13 ] .
the residual galactosylation was explained by the discovery of an unusual udp - sugar pyrophosphorylase ( usp ) ( ec 2.7.7.64 ) that can activate alpha - d - galactose - 1 - phosphate ( gal - 1p ) and glc - 1p with utp to form the corresponding udp - sugar [ 15 ] .
recently , deletion of usp in l. major was shown to abolish conversion of gal - 1p into udp - gal confirming its role in galactose salvage [ 16 ] .
interestingly , the hexose transporters of the related trypanosomatids t. brucei and t. cruzi are unable to transport galactose [ 17,18 ] and the only route to udp - gal formation in these two parasites is via epimerisation of udp - glc , which is essential for parasite growth [ 19 - 21 ] .
in this study , we applied a combination of gene deletion and protein destabilisation to evaluate the importance of the udp - glc / udp - gal biosynthesis .
thus , biosynthesis of these two nucleotide sugars could be reduced to minimal level , leading to growth cessation and cell death .
methods parasite culture promastigote cultures of wild type l. major mhom / su / 73 / 5askh and respective mutant cell lines were grown at 27degreesc in standard culture media consisting of m199 medium ( invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated fetal calf serum , 40 mm hepes ph 7.5 , 0.1 mm adenine , 0.0005 % hemin , 0.0002 % biotin .
antibiotics ( invivo gen ) were added as required at a concentration of 5 mug / ml phleomycin , 50 mug / ml hygromycin , 30 mug / ml puromycin and 100 mug / ml nourseothricin .
for the maintenance of the ugp - / - usp - / c mutant described below , 1 mum fk506 ( lc laboratories ) was added to medium .
if lower fk506 concentrations were used , parasites were pelleted and washed twice with medium before being resuspended with the desired fk506 concentration .
generation of l. major ugp - / - usp - / c strain sequence of all primers used can be found in s1 table .
a usp gene ( lmjf17.1160 ) replacement cassette carrying the puromycin resistance gene pac was constructed by double - joint pcr .
2.3 kb of the 5 ' - utr and 1.3 kb of the 3 ' - utr were amplified with the primer pair 5utr _ 1fw / 5utr _ 1rev and 3utr _ 1fw / 3utr _ 1rev respectively .
the pac gene was amplified with primer pair ol _ pacfw / ol _ pacrev having 52bp homology to the 5 ' - utr ( forward primer ) or 51bp homology to the 3 ' - utr ( reverse primer ) .
after fusion of the 3 amplicons , the final cassette was obtained by nested pcr with primer pair 5utr _ 3fw / 3utr _ 3rev and ligated into pyes - nta vector via not i restriction sites ( plasmid # 3612 ) .
the deletion cassette was excised with bbv ci / xcm i , separated on tae 0.7 % agarose , extracted from gel , ethanol precipitated and dissolved in water at ~ 2 mug / mul .
additionally , a knock - in construct was created based on the generic plasmid pgem - mcs1 - phleo - dst ir - ddmcs2 ( b6323 , kind gift of s. m. beverley ) [ 5 ] .
the phleomycin resistance gene was first exchanged by the nourseothricin resistance gene sat using msc i and rsr ii restriction sites , yielding pgem - mcs1 - sat - dst ir - ddmcs2 ( plasmid # 3625 ) .
then 2.0 kb of the vicinal usp 5'utr were cloned with primer pair sd177 / sd178 and inserted upstream of sat in the nde i and spe i sites .
similarly , 1.8 kb from the start of the usp gene were amplified with primers sd175 / usp3rev and inserted directly behind the destabilisation domain ( dd ) via the bgl ii and sac ii sites ( plasmid # 3628 ) .
the knock - in cassette was excised with nde i / sac ii and purified .
transfections were performed by electroporation , using the high voltage protocol and cytomix buffer as previously described [ 22 ] .
ugp - / - usp - /+ ( deltaugp : : ble / deltaugp : : hyg / deltausp : : pac / usp ) clones were generated by transfection of the usp gene replacement cassette into the l. major ugp - / - mutant ( deltaugp : : ble / deltaugp : : hyg ) [ 13 ] .
likewise ugp - / - usp - / c clones ( deltaugp : : hyg / deltaugp : : ble / deltausp : : pac / sat - fkbp fk506i : : usp ) were obtained by replacing one usp allele by the knock - in cassette to create ugp - / - usp +/ c clones ( deltaugp : : hyg / deltaugp : : ble / usp / sat - fkbp fk506i : : usp ) and subsequently deleting the remaining usp allele .
these clones were recovered on semi - solid plates containing 1 % noble agar , appropriate antibiotics and 1 mumfk506 .
analysis of 3 single clones is presented in this manuscript .
correct insertion of the respective gene replacement or knock - in cassette was analysed by pcr and southern blot .
genomic dna was isolated from log phase parasites by phenol / chloroform extraction .
southern blots were performed according to standard methods .
dig - labelled probes were synthesised using the dig dna labelling mix from roche with primer pairs sd1 / usp1 _ rev ; sd176 / sd21 and sd70 / sd71 .
western blotting early log phase promastigote lysates were separated on sds - page and transferred onto pvdf membranes .
equal protein load was assessed by coomassie brilliant blue protein staining of an identically loaded sds - page ran separately .
infrared detection on li - cor odyssey imager was performed after incubation with monoclonal anti - lpg wic79.3 antibody ( protein g purified from mouse hybridoma cells ) and goat anti - mouse igg ir800 dye 800 cw ( li - cor ) at dilutions of 1:1,000 and 1:20,000 , respectively. l. major usp was detected using a 1:20,000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti - serum [ 16 ] and goat anti - rabbit igg ir800 dye 800 cw ( li - cor ) .
in vitro enzyme assays conversion of gal - 1p into udp - gal or glc - 1p into udp - glc by log phase promastigotes lysates was measured as previously described [ 16 ] .
statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism 4 software ( graph - pad software inc. , la jolla , ca ) using one - way anova with tukey multiple comparison post - test .
quantification of nucleotide sugars nucleotide sugar pools of wild type l. major and the ugp - / - usp - / c clones conditionally stabilized ( 1 mum fk506 ) and partially destabilized ( 0.01 mum fk506 ) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography - electrospray ionisation - tandem mass spectrometry using multiple reaction monitoring as previously described [ 23 ] .
each nucleotide sugar peak was integrated , normalized to its internal standard gdp - glc and to the respective nucleotide sugar standard of known concentration .
medium containing 0.01mum fk506 was preferred for this experiment to reduce cell death .
statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism 4 software using a paired t - test to compare ugp - / - usp - / c grown in high and low fk506 containing medium .
gipl analysis by maldi - tof ms log phase promastigotes were extracted in chloroform / methanol / water ( 5:10:4 ) , purified over a c18 / seppak plus column ( waters ) and dried under a nitrogen stream as described previously [ 24 ] .
gipls ( 1.6x107 cell equivalents ) were dissolved in chcl3 / meoh / h2o ( 15:30:4 ) , mixed with 6 - aza - 2 - thiothymidine matrix ( 5 mug / mul h2o ) and spotted on a metal target plate .
matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight ( maldi - tof ) mass spectrometry was carried out with a voyager de pro ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) in negative - ion reflector mode over the m / z range 900 - 2000 with an accelerating voltage of 20 kv and a delay of 150 ns. final mass spectra represented an average of 6 - 8 spectra , each of which is acquired from 200 laser shots .
spectra were processed using data explorer software v4.8 applying " advanced baseline correction " and " noise removal " .
analysis of cell viability late log phase promastigotes were washed with pbs and transferred to medium containing 1 mum , 0.05 mum , 0.005 mum fk506 or no fk506 at a cell density of 106 cells / ml. after 3 days , parasites were diluted with fresh medium to 6 x 105 cells / ml and allowed to grow for another 2 days .
parasites were then harvested by centrifugation , washed twice in ice - cold pbs , and resuspended at a density of 5 x 106 parasites / ml. after addition of 5 mul of 7 - amino - actinomycin d ( 7 - aad ) solution per 100 mul and incubation for 15 min at room temperature in the dark , 8,000 cells of each sample were analysed by facs ( facscalibur ) .
statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism 4 software using one - way anova with tukey multiple comparison post - test .
results generation of a mutant with minimal udp - glc / udp - gal biosynthesis upon deletion of ugp , significant amount of udp - glc and udp - gal was still synthesized by leishmania parasites [ 13 ] , which is likely due to a partial compensation by usp [ 15 ] .
we thus anticipated that deletion of both usp and ugp would abrogate biosynthesis of these two nucleotide sugars .
in a first step , we were able to replace one allele of usp with a gene encoding resistance to puromycin ( pac ) in the previously described ugp - mutant [ 13 ] to generate an heterozygous mutant named ugp - / - usp - /+ ( deltaugp : : ble / deltaugp : : hyg / deltausp : : pac / usp ) .
however , despite several attempts , replacement of both alleles of usp in the ugp - mutant remained unsuccessful .
aiming at reducing the udp - glc / udp - gal biosynthesis to a minimum , we replaced one of the usp allele by a cassette encoding usp n - terminally fused to a mutated fk506 binding protein ( fkbp ) destabilizing domain called thereafter ddusp whereas the second usp allele and ugp alleles were deleted ( fig 1 ) .
the degron system enables stabilisation of the protein of interest by addition of fk506 to the culture medium and its conditional destabilisation by removal of fk506 [ 5 ] .
the resulting conditional mutant ( deltaugp : : hyg / deltaugp : : ble / deltausp : : pac / sat - fkbp fk506i : : usp ) was analysed by southern blot to confirm correct integration of the deletion and knock - in cassettes ( s1 fig ) and was named ugp - / - usp - / c. three independent clones were selected and analysed in this study .
10.1371 / journal.pntd.0004205.g001 fig 1 generation of leishmania major ugp - / - usp - / c mutant. l. major ugp - / - usp - / c mutant was generated from a ugp deficient mutant [ 11 ] by replacement of a usp allele with a construct encoding usp n - terminally fused to a mutated fk506 binding protein destabilizing domain ( ddusp ) .
this system enables stabilisation of the fusion protein by addition of fk506 to the culture medium and its proteasomal degradation in absence of fk506 .
the second usp allele was replaced by transfection with a puromycin resistance gene ( pac ) .
ble , phleomycin resistance gene ; hyg , hygromycin resistance gene ; sat , nourseothricin resistance gene .
the absence of ugp had been demonstrated in the parental strain by western blot using a rabbit polyclonal anti - ugp serum [ 13 ] .
to confirm the functionality of the degradation system in the different ugp - / - usp - / c clones , we analysed the usp protein level in lysates of log phase promastigotes using a rabbit polyclonal anti - usp serum [ 16 ] .
as shown in fig 2a ( upper panel ) , in presence of 1 mum fk506 , ddusp was clearly detectable at approximately 81 kda ( usp : ~ 69 kda ; destabilising domain : ~ 12 kda ) whereas in wild type parasites , native usp migrated at approximately 69 kda .
the amount of ddusp in the different clones stabilised with 1mum fk506 was estimated to 50 - 60 % of wild type from the signal intensity .
as anticipated , at lower fk506 concentrations of 0.05 mum , only traces of ddusp were still discernible and the enzyme was essentially absent if the fk506 concentration was reduced to 0.005 mum ( fig 2a , upper panel , right ) .
as expected usp level was not affected by the fk506 concentration in wild type parasites ( fig 2a , upper panel , left ) .

the length of the alkyl and acyl chains is indicated above each peak ; c - indicates absence of an alkyl chain .
regulation of the udp - glc / udp - gal biosynthesis in l. major using the degron system the ability of wild type and mutant parasites to convert glc - 1p and gal - 1p into the corresponding nucleotide sugars was measured in promastigote lysates and is presented in fig 2b .
enzymatic activities measured with lysates of wild type parasites were unaffected by fk506 addition to the growth medium .
when using glc - 1p as substrate , lysate of the ugp - / - usp - / c mutant grown with 1 mum fk506 presented about 4.5 % of the activity obtained with wild type lysate .
since the contribution of usp was previously estimated of about 10 % in a ugp deficient mutant [ 13 ] , the present value is consistent with stabilisation of ddusp produced by one allele .
only 1 % activity could still be measured when the enzyme was stabilised with 0.05 mum fk506 and this dropped below the limits of detection when lower drug concentrations were used .
similar values were obtained when gal - 1p was used as substrate. with 1mum fk506 in the culture medium , the stabilised ddusp had an activity of 0.06 u / mg that represents approximately 55 % of the wild type activity ( 0.11 u / mg ) .
when grown in presence of 0.05 mum fk506 , the ugp - / - usp - / c mutant lysate showed a low udp - gal synthesis capacity of 13 % of wild type activity .
the enzymatic activity became undetectable with lower drug concentrations .
these results provide evidence for the functionality of the conditional degron system , which allows us to reduce usp protein level and enzymatic activity to background level .
analysis of lpg and gipls we analysed the effects of regulating udp - glc and udp - gal biosynthesis , using the degron system , on the production of lpg and gipls .
equal amounts of cell lysate were run on 12 % sds - page , blotted on pvdf membrane and developed using the monoclonal antibody wic79.3 , which is specific for galactosylated phosphoglycans repeat units ( fig 2a , middle panel ) .
loading was controlled by coomassie blue staining ( figs 2a , lower panel , and s2 ) .
as expected , the ugp - / - usp - / c mutant stabilised by the presence of 1 mum fk506 only showed a faint lpg signal , weaker as the signal of the ugp - / - parental strain ( s3 fig ) .
this faint lpg signal ( figs 2a and s3 show the clone with the highest lpg signal ) was reduced to below the limits of detection if the mutant was supplemented with lower fk506 concentrations ( fig 2a ) .
interestingly , our first attempt to generate an ugp - / - usp - / c mutant resulted in clones devoid of lpg .
however , ectopic expression of ugp in these clones or in the ugp - / - usp - /+ clone from which they were derived did not restore lpg biosynthesis .
this suggests that leishmania can adapt to the low udp - glc / udp - gal availability by shutting down lpg biosynthesis , which is dispensable for in vitro growth [ 24,25 ] .
in order to avoid in vitro adaptation , the clones presented in this study were maintained in 1 mum fk506 and the number of passages limited .
moreover , lpg expression was regularly checked .
gipls purified from the ugp - / - usp - / c mutant and wild type parasites were analysed by maldi - tof mass spectrometry in negative ion mode ( figs 2c and s3 ) .
the observed ions were annotated based on structures previously reported and correspond to type 2 gipls with 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 galactose residues termed im2 , gipl - 1 , gipl - 2 and gipl - 3 respectively [ 26 ] .
additional heterogeneity arises from the lipid part that is either an alkylacylglycerol or lysoalkylglycerol with aliphatic chains of various lengths ( s2 table ) .
remarkably , stabilisation of ddusp with 1 mum fk506 was sufficient to maintain galactosylation of gipls ( figs 2c and s3 ) .
however , at low fk506 concentration , gipls were virtually agalactosylated .
only traces of gipl - 1 ( containing one galactofuranose residue ) were still visible at a fk506 concentration of 0.01 mum .
this loss of galactosylation upon ddusp destabilisation reflects depletion of the cell 's udp - glc and udp - gal pools as shown below .
the nucleotide sugar pools in wild type l. major and the ugp - / - usp - / c clones were measured by high performance liquid chromatography - electrospray ionisation - tandem mass spectrometry using multiple reactions monitoring as previously described [ 23 ] .
surprisingly , stabilisation of the enzyme produced from a single ddusp allele ( with 1 mum fk506 ) was sufficient to maintain the steady - state pools of udp - glc and udp - gal ( fig 3 ) .
in all clones , a strong reduction of the udp - glc and udp - gal pools was nevertheless observed upon destabilisation of usp in medium containing 0.01 mum fk506 .
in contrast , the gdp - man and gdp - ara pools did not significantly differ from the pools measured in wild type parasites ( fig 3 ) .
unexpectedly , the pool of udp - n - acetylglucosamine ( udp - glcnac ) seemed to slightly decrease in the ugp - / - usp - / c mutant upon usp destabilisation ( 0.01mum fk506 ) whereas the gdp - fucose ( gdp - fuc ) pool , which is very small in wild type parasite , was strongly elevated in these conditions .
10.1371 / journal.pntd.0004205.g003 fig 3 analysis of nucleotide sugar pools in l. major wild type and ugp - / - usp - / c mutant .
nucleotide sugars were extracted from mid log phase wild type ( wt ) and ugp - / - usp - / c promastigotes grown in presence of 1 mum (+) or 0.01 mum ( - ) fk506 and measured by liquid chromatography - electrospray ionisation - tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring .

analysis of growth and cell death in l. major ugp - / - usp - / c mutant wild type parasites and the ugp - / - usp - / c mutant maintained in 1 mum fk506 were washed and transferred to medium with various fk506 concentrations at a density of 105 parasites / ml. as seen in fig 4a ( upper panel ) , growth of the ugp - / - usp - / c mutant slowed down with decreasing fk506 concentrations .
if parasites were split after 3 to 4 days ( when density reached ~ 2 - 3 x 107 cells / ml ) , the cells continued to grow with kinetics similar to wild type in the presence of 1 mum fk506 , whereas no proliferation was observed if fk506 was absent or present at a concentration of 0.005 mum ( fig 4a , lower panel ) .

( b ) analysis of cell viability .
parasites grown in medium containing the indicated fk506 concentration were labelled with 7 - aad and analysed by flow cytometry .
mean percentages +/ - sem of dead parasites ( 7 - aad +) were calculated from four independent experiments ( n = 4 ) .
significant difference (* p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 ) , one - way anova with tukey post test .
to analyse cell viability , we labelled parasites grown in medium containing different fk506 concentrations with the dna intercalator 7 - aad and analysed them by flow cytometry .
the results displayed in fig 4b indicated that less than 5 % dead cells were present in cultures of wild type leishmania .
the number of dead cells remained low in the ugp - / - usp - /+ heterozygote or ugp - / - usp - / c cultures supplemented with 0.05mum fk506 or more .
in contrast , with a fk506 concentration of 0.005mum or less , the percentage of dead cells exceeded 35 % .
discussion in eukaryotes , the biosynthesis of glycans , such as those creating a protective cell surface glycocalyx or cell wall , requires the activation of monosaccharides in the form of nucleotide sugars .
these high - energy compounds may be formed from appropriate monosaccharides or be generated from interconversion of existing nucleotide sugars .
for example , depending on the cell type , udp - gal , udp - galacturonic acid , udp - glucuronic acid , udp - xylose and udp - arabinose may be generated from udp - glc .
in leishmania parasites , however , the variety of nucleotide sugars synthesised is limited to udp - glc , udp - gal , udp - glcnac , gdp - man , gdp - fuc and gdp - arabinose [ 23 ] .
previous works have shown that in this protozoan parasite , udp - gal is synthesised by a de novo pathway involving ugp [ 13,14 ] and by a salvage pathway mediated by usp [ 15,16 ] .
deficiency of ugp alone does not abolish biosynthesis of udp - gal and its immediate precursor udp - glc [ 13 ] since , as we demonstrate here , their biosynthesis is partially compensated by usp .
targeted deletion of both ugp and usp was however unsuccessful suggesting that the metabolites udp - glc and / or udp - gal are essential for leishmania in vitro growth .
to demonstrate the importance of the udp - glc / udp - gal biosynthesis , we therefore deleted one of the two usp alleles in the ugp deficient strain ( ugp - / - ) and used a degron system enabling conditional degradation of the enzyme produced by the remaining usp allele ( fig 1 ) .
addition of 1mum fk506 to the growth medium enabled stabilisation of the ddusp protein product and supported restricted udp - glc and udp - gal biosynthesis , which was nonetheless sufficient to maintain parasite growth. with low fk506 concentrations , ddusp was destabilised and the udp - glc / udp - gal biosynthesis could be reduced to minimal level leading to growth arrest and cell death , allowing us to demonstrate that udp - gal and / or udp - glc are essential metabolites for l. major promastigotes .
one of the most distinctive roles of udp - glc and derived nucleotide sugars is the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates forming the cell surface coat .
in bacteria , ugp controls the biosynthesis of the most important virulence factors and is valued as antibacterial target since it is frequently essential for pathogenicity or growth [ 27 ] .
similarly , in the trypanosomatid parasites trypanosoma brucei and trypanosoma cruzi , which are closely related to leishmania , biosynthesis of udp - glc is essential for parasite growth .
in these parasites , however , targeting of the udp - glucose 4 ' - epimerase demonstrated that the lack of udp - gal , rather than its precursor udp - glc , is responsible for growth cessation .
in both parasites , the growth phenotype was linked to alterations of the glycocalyx [ 19 - 21 ] .
in leishmania , stabilisation of the enzyme produced from a single usp allele with 1 mum fk506 was sufficient to maintain the steady - state udp - gal and udp - glc pools and support in vitro growth .
the maintenance of normal udp - gal and udp - glc levels under these conditions ( where de novo synthesis of udp - glc is less than 5 % of wild - type ) reflects a strong reduction of udp - gal consumption at the expense of lpg synthesis .
an irreversible shutdown of lpg biosynthesis has even been observed in a heterozygote ugp - / - usp - /+ clone , in adaptation to the inadequate udp - gal availability .
in contrast , the limited udp - gal biosynthesis governed by a single usp allele was sufficient to maintain galactosylation of gipls .
this is very similar to the situation in t.cruzi epimastigotes , where deletion of one copy of the udp - glucose 4 ' - epimerase encoding gene was permissive to the synthesis of galactosylated gipls at the expense of the synthesis of the highly galactosylated gpi - anchored surface mucins [ 19 ] .
one might assume that galactosylated gipls are important for in vitro survival and thus are retained by l. major promastigotes .
however , a mutant expressing agalactosylated gipls due to absence of udp - galactopyranose mutase ( the enzyme that enables formation of udp - galactofuranose necessary for addition of the first galactose residue ) grew normally [ 24 ] .
in fact , many leishmania mutants deficient in one or several glycoconjugates have been generated and do not present major in vitro growth phenotypes [ 6 ] .
essentiality of the major glycoconjugates such as lpgs , ppgs , gipls or n - glycans can therefore be excluded .
yet , minor components that have until now remained undetected may be crucial for parasite survival .
in this regard , we know that the synthesis of gdp - fuc is essential for t. brucei and likely also for leishmania [ 28,29 ] , although to date no fucose containing glycoconjugates have been described in these parasites .
leishmania possesses a unique gdp - fucose biosynthetic pathway involving two bifunctional enzymes with kinase and pyrophosphorylase activities ( encoded by lmjf16.0440 and lmjf16.0480 ) able to activate l - fuc into gdp - fuc .
in this parasite , the classical de novo synthesis of gdp - fuc from gdp - man seems to be absent .
indeed , deletion of both fucokinase / pyrophosphorylases could only be obtained after expression of the de novo gdp - fuc pathway enzymes from trypanosoma [ 28 ] .
in trypanosoma brucei , a fucosyltransferase acting on a gal acceptor structure has recently been characterised [ 30 ] and an orthologue is predicted in leishmania .
the increase of gdp - fuc observed in the destabilised ugp - / - usp - / c mutant may thus reflect a non - utilisation of this nucleotide sugar due to the absence of acceptor structures .
thus it cannot be excluded that the phenotype observed in the ugp - / - usp - / c mutant is linked to absence of fucose containing structure ( s ) .
as in other eukaryotes , udp - glc is also required in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) for glucosylation of newly synthesised glycoproteins by the udp - glucose : glycoprotein glucosyltransferase ( uggt ) ; a reaction that promotes protein folding .
however , in the trypanosomatids t. brucei and t. cruzi , uggt is not essential for parasite growth in standard conditions [ 31,32 ] .
shortage of udp - glc in the er might thus challenge the protein folding machinery and activates the unfolded protein response [ 31,33 - 35 ] but these are likely not responsible for the lethal phenotype observed under standard culture conditions .
like other kinetoplastid flagellates , leishmania parasites also need udp - glc in the nucleus for the synthesis of an unusual dna base called base j ( beta - d - glucosyl - hydroxymethyluracil ) [ 36 ] .
base j replaces at most 1 % of thymidines in telomeric repeats and at transcription initiation and termination sites and was shown to regulate transcription [ 37 ] .
in leishmania , base j is believed to be essential since attempts to delete jbp1 , a gene encoding one of the two thymidine hydroxylases involved in the first step of base j synthesis ( formation of 5 - hydroxymethyluracil ) , have been unsuccessful [ 34 ]. whether glucosylation of 5 - hydroxymethyluracil , is also essential for leishmania growth remains to be determined .
a gradual loss of residual base j upon cell division [ 38 ] could however explain the late appearance of the lethal phenotype of l. major ugp - / - usp - / c. further studies are necessary to define whether udp - glc and / or udp - gal are / is the essential metabolite in leishmania and to identify the downstream pathway ( s ) essential for parasite survival .
in the trypanosomatids t. brucei and t. cruzi , both the udp - glucose 4 ' - epimerase and ugp have been validated as potential therapeutic targets against trypanosomiasis [ 19 - 21,39 ] .
however because of the high degree of similarity within the catalytic site with human ugp , specific inhibition of trypanosomatids ugps might require the design of allosteric inhibitors [ 39 - 41 ] .
in leishmania , the existence of a salvage pathway mediated by usp , which should also be inhibited , is a further challenge for the development of specific drugs .
identification of the essential pathway ( s ) requiring udp - glc or udp - gal might thus provide new targets for the development of specific drugs to combat leishmaniases .

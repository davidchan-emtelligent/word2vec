copper 1,4 - diols free radical 1,5 - h radical shift hydroperoxides molecular oxygen this article is part of the thematic series " organic free radical chemistry " .
introduction aliphatic sp3 c - h bonds are ubiquitous components in organic molecules but rather inert towards most of the chemical reactions .
it thus remains as one of the most challenging topics in organic synthesis to develop catalytic oxidative sp3 c - h functionalization with predictable chemo - and regioselectivity [ 1 - 4 ] .
to achieve this goal , we have recently utilized 1,5 - h - radical shift [ 5 - 6 ] with iminyl radical species ( n - radicals ) generated under cu - catalyzed aerobic reaction conditions , in which the resulting carbon - centered radicals ( c - radicals ) could be trapped by molecular oxygen to form new c - o bonds .
for instance , the cu - catalyzed aerobic reaction of n - alkylamidines afforded aminidyl radicals ( n - radicals ) by single - electron oxidation and deprotonation of the amidine moiety , which was followed by 1,5 - h - radical shift to generate the corresponding c - radicals ( scheme 1 ) [ 7 ] .
the successive trapping of the resulting c - radicals with molecular o2 forms peroxy radicals ( the c - o bond formation ) .
reduction of peroxy radicals generates alkoxides , cyclization of which with the amidine moiety finally affords dihydrooxazoles .
similarly , it was also revealed that the sp3 c - h oxygenation could proceed directed by the n - h ketimine moieties under cu - catalyzed aerobic conditions via the corresponding iminyl radical species , where 1,2 - diacylbenzenes and amino endoperoxides could be synthesized by c - h oxygenation of secondary and tertiary c - h bonds , respectively ( scheme 1 ) [ 8 - 9 ] .
scheme 1 aliphatic c - h oxidation with amidines and ketimines by 1,5 - h radical shift .
stimulated by these remote sp3 c - h oxidation reactions using the nitrogen - centered radicals derived from amidines and ketimines , we became interested to utilize oxygen - centered radicals ( o - radicals ) for the sp3 c - h functionalization .
in this context , we envision employing hydroperoxides as precursors for o - radicals in the presence of cu salts .
the lower valent cu ( i ) species could potentially undergo single - electron reduction of hydroperoxides to produce the corresponding o - radicals [ 10 - 13 ] .
ball recently reported cucl - catalyzed aliphatic c - h chlorination using hydroperoxides as the o - radical source , in which the c - radicals generated by the 1,5 - h radical shift were chlorinated ( scheme 2 ) [ 14 ] .
if reductive generation of the o - radicals from hydroperoxides could be achieved under an o2 atmosphere , the c - radicals generated by 1,5 - h radical shift could be trapped by o2 to form the new c - o bonds .
herein , we report the realization of this concept mainly for the aerobic synthesis of 1,4 - diols from hydroperoxides , which could be catalyzed by the cu ( oac ) 2 - 1,10 - phenanthroline system in the presence of et3n as a terminal reductant of the cu ( ii ) species ( scheme 2 ) .
scheme 2 aliphatic c - h oxidation with hydroperoxides .
findings we commenced our investigation with the cu - catalyzed aerobic reactions of hydroperoxide 1a in the presence of et3n as a terminal reductant [ 15 ] to keep lower valent cu ( i ) species in the reaction mixture ( table 1 ) .
as expected , when 1a was treated with cu ( oac ) 2 ( 20 mol %) in the presence of et3n ( 2 equiv ) in dmf , the reaction proceeded at room temperature for 17 h to afford c - h oxygenation products , cyclic hemiacetal 2a and 1,4 - diol 3a in 49 % and 8 % yields , respectively ( table 1 , entry 1 ) .
it was found that addition of nitrogen ligands such as 2,2 ' - bipyridine and 1,10 - phenanthroline ( 1,10 - phen ) accelerated the reaction ( table 1 , entries 2 and 3 ) .
the reactions with cucl2 ( table 1 , entry 4 ) as well as cucl ( table 1 , entry 5 ) resulted in comparable results with that by cu ( oac ) 2 .
further optimization of the reaction conditions by the solvent screening ( table 1 , entries 6 - 11 ) revealed that the co - solvent system ( benzene / mecn or toluene / mecn ) performed best to give the highest yield ( 83 - 87 % combined yields of 2a and 3a , table 1 , entries 9 - 11 ) , in which the amount of et3n could be reduced to 0.5 equiv ( table 1 , entries 10 and 11 ) .
it is worthy of note that the catalytic loading of cu ( oac ) 2 - 1,10 - phen could be lowered to 5 mol % while maintaining good combined yields of 2a and 3a ( 89 % , table 1 , entry 13 ) .
upon completion of the c - h oxygenation under the reaction conditions in entry 13 , the resulting crude residue after removal of the solvents was treated with lialh4 in thf , affording 1,4 - diol 3a as the sole product in 90 % yield ( table 1 , entry 14 ) .
the cu - catalyzed reaction of 1a under an inert ( n2 ) atmosphere gave an intramolecular c - h oxygenation product , dihydroisobenzofuran 4a in 47 % yield ( table 1 , entry 15 ) .

bisolated yields are recorded .
cafter stirring 5 h , the volatile materials were removed in vacuo , and the resulting crude materials were further treated with lialh4 ( 1.2 equiv ) in thf at rt for 1 h. dthe reaction was conducted under a n2 atmosphere .
the proposed reaction pathways for the formation of 2a , 3a , and 4a were described in scheme 3 .
single - electron reduction of the starting cu ( oac ) 2 by et3n forms the cu ( i ) species , which reduces hydroperoxide 1a to give o - radical i along with the generation of the cu ( ii ) species .
1,5 - h - radical shift of o - radical i generates c - radical ii , which is trapped by molecular o2 to give peroxy radical iii .
probably further reaction of iii with cu ( i ) species gives cu ( ii ) - peroxide iv , which undergoes fragmentation to give aldehyde v [ 16 - 18 ] , which in turn cyclizes to afford hemiacetal 2a .
protonation of cu ( ii ) - peroxide iv followed by the reduction of the resulting hydroperoxide deliver 1,4 - diol 3a .
in the absence of molecular o2 ( under a n2 atmosphere , table 1 , entry 15 ) , the resulting c - radical i is oxidized by the cu ( ii ) species to give carbocation vi [ 19 ] , which is trapped by the intramolecular hydroxy group to give 4a .
scheme 3 proposed reaction mechanisms for the formation of 2a , 3a , and 4a .
we next explored the substrate scope of the present aerobic strategy for the synthesis of 1,4 - diols by targeting methylene c - h oxygenation with various tertiary hydroperoxides 1 ( table 2 ) .
generally , oxygenation of benzylic methylene c - h bonds proceeded smoothly to give the corresponding 1,4 - diols 3 in good to moderate yields ( 77 - 51 % yields ) ( table 2 , entries 1 - 7 ) .
moreover , the present method allowed for oxygenation of nonbenzylic methylene c - h bonds , while yields of obtained 1,4 - diols 3 were relatively low ( 65 - 40 % yields ) ( table 2 , entries 8 - 13 ) .
in most cases ( except for table 2 , entries 3 , 6 , 7 and 11 ) , either reduced alcohols 5 ( up to 23 % yield ) or fragmented alcohols 6 ( up to 23 % yield ) , or both were observed as minor products .
the formation of alcohols 5 occurs by two - electron reduction of hydroperoxides 1 followed by protonation or by h - radical abstraction of the transient o - radical generated by one - electron reduction of hydroperoxides 1 prior to the 1,5 - h radical shift ( scheme 4 ) .
presumably , radical fragmentation of o - radicals occurs to give the corresponding ketones 7 , which are reduced by lialh4 in the next step to give alcohols 6 ( scheme 4 ) .

after stirring for 4 - 7 h , the volatile materials were removed in vacuo , and the resulting crude materials were further treated with lialh4 ( 1.2 equiv ) in thf at rt for 1 h. isolated yields are recorded .

scheme 4 proposed reaction mechanisms for the formation of 5 and 6 .
the reaction of a secondary hydroperoxide such as 1o , however , afforded c - h oxygenation product 2o ( as a keto form ) only in 30 % yield along with the formation of the corresponding reduced alcohol 5o and ketone 8o in 10 % and 43 % yields , respectively ( scheme 5 ) .
scheme 5 the reaction of secondary hydroperoxide 1o .
oxygenation of tertiary c - h bonds was also examined under the present aerobic conditions ( table 3 ) .
in these cases , the cu - catalyzed aerobic reactions afford hydroperoxides 9 as an initial aerobic c - h oxygenation product .
after stirring for 5 - 7 h , the reaction mixtures were successively treated with pph3 ( 1 equiv ) for the reduction of 9 to obtain 1,4 - diols 3 .
although the desired 1,4 - diols 3 were formed with this two - step one - pot procedure , the isolated yields of 3p - 3r were moderate ( 45 - 52 % yields ) ( table 3 , entries 1 - 3 ) .
the oxygenation of the adamantyl c - h bond was especially sluggish , giving the desired 1,4 - diol 3s in only 23 % yield ( table 3 , entry 4 ) .
similarly , in these reactions , the formation of reduced alcohols 5 ( for table 3 , entries 1 and 2 ) and fragmented ketones 7 ( for table 3 , entries 1 - 4 ) were observed as minor products .

after stirring for 5 - 7 h , the reaction mixture was further treated with pph3 ( 1 equiv ) at rt. isolated yields are recorded .
b 1h nmr yields with 1,1,2,2 - tetrachloroethane as an internal standard .
our next challenge was to develop direct aerobic dioxygenation of alkanes using the present radical strategy .
the generation of c - radicals from alkanes at c - h bonds bearing relatively weak bond - dissociation enthalpies ( i.e. , tertiary alkyl c - h bonds , benzylic c - h bonds , etc. ) , by phthalimide n - oxyl radicals generated oxidatively from n - hydroxyphthalimide ( nhpi ) , has been reported [ 20 - 22 ] .
the resulting c - radicals could be trapped with molecular oxygen to form hydroperoxides .
it could be envisioned that this aerobic c - h bond oxygenation could be combined with the present remote c - h oxygenation with hydroperoxides , presumably resulting in direct formation of 1,4 - dioxygenated compounds from nonoxygenated alkanes ( scheme 6 ) .
scheme 6 1,4 - dioxygenation of alkanes. with this hypothesis , alkane 10 bearing a dibenzylic tertiary c - h bond ( marked in green ) was treated with the catalytic system of cucl - 1,10 - phen ( 20 mol %) with nhpi in benzene / mecn solvent under an o2 atmosphere ( 1 atm ) ( scheme 7 ) .
the reaction with 20 mol % of nhpi proceeded as expected at 50 degreesc to afford a mixture of lactol 2i and 1,4 - diols 3i in 29 % and 3 % yields , respectively , via the desired 1,4 - dioxygenation , while benzophenone ( 7b ) was also formed in 30 % yield through fragmentation of the transient alkoxy radical ( scheme 4 ) .
use of 40 mol % of nhpi slightly improved the yields of 1,4 - dioxygenation products 2i and 3i ( 40 % and 4 % yields , respectively ) .
scheme 7 aerobic 1,4 - dioxygenation of alkanes in the cucl - nhpi catalytic system .
in conclusion , we have developed the cu - catalyzed aerobic oxygenation of aliphatic c - h bonds using hydroperoxides by a 1,5 - h radical shift of putative o - radicals derived from hydroperoxides followed by trapping of the resulting c - radicals with molecular oxygen .
a preliminary result involving the direct 1,4 - dioxygenation of alkane 10 was demonstrated by using the present method .
further studies will be carried out to develop more robust and efficient catalytic aerobic radical transformations for polyol synthesis from rather simple alkanes .

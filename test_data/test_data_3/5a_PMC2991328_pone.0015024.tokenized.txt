background when a second target ( t2 ) is presented in close succession of a first target ( t1 ) , people often fail to identify t2 , a phenomenon known as the attentional blink ( ab ) .
however , the ab can be reduced substantially when participants are distracted during the task , for instance by a concurrent task , without a cost for t1 performance .
the goal of the current study was to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of this paradoxical effect .
methodology / principal findings participants successively performed three tasks , while eeg was recorded .
the first task ( standard ab ) consisted of identifying two target letters in a sequential stream of distractor digits .
the second task ( grey dots task ) was similar to the first task with the addition of an irrelevant grey dot moving in the periphery , concurrent with the central stimulus stream .
the third task ( red dot task ) was similar to the second task , except that detection of an occasional brief color change in the moving grey dot was required .
ab magnitude in the latter task was significantly smaller , whereas behavioral performance in the standard and grey dots tasks did not differ .
using mixed effects models , electrophysiological activity was compared during trials in the grey dots and red dot tasks that differed in task instruction but not in perceptual input .
in the red dot task , both target - related parietal brain activity associated with working memory updating ( p3 ) as well as distractor - related occipital activity was significantly reduced .
conclusions / significance the results support the idea that the ab might ( at least partly ) arise from an overinvestment of attentional resources or an overexertion of attentional control , which is reduced when a distracting secondary task is carried out .
the present findings bring us a step closer in understanding why and how an ab occurs , and how these temporal restrictions in selective attention can be overcome .
introduction although the human mind is quite capable of performing multiple tasks at the same time , the multitasking brain does not always react accurate or fast enough in complex situations .
an obvious example is that the likelihood of traffic accidents increases when driving is combined with the concurrent use of a cellular phone , especially when the level of complexity increases and additional attentional control is required [ 1 ] .
however , under some circumstances described below , an increase in cognitive load can reduce temporal restrictions in attention , such that one 's multitasking performance improves rather than deteriorates .
within the lab , restrictions in temporal attention are for instance revealed when two targets ( e.g. , letters ) are presented in close temporal proximity within a sequential stream of distractor stimuli ( e.g. , digits ) .
when the second target ( t2 ) is presented within ~ 200 to 500 ms after the onset of the first target ( t1 ) , participants often fail to report the second target , reflecting the occurrence of an attentional blink ( ab ) [ 2 ] .
it has been shown , however , that identification performance can increase when a second task is added to this so - called ab task [ 3 ] - [ 6 ] .
the aim of the current study was to investigate this paradoxical phenomenon in more detail .
for two decades , the ab has been a major topic in attention research because it is informative about the rate at which stimuli can be encoded into consciously accessible representations .
as the ab can be obtained using a variety of stimuli and task conditions , it is thought to reflect a very general property of perceptual awareness ( for a review , see [ 7 ]) .
however , recent findings suggest that the ab is unlikely to reflect a hard - wired bottleneck .
for instance , the presence of perceptual , spatial , or temporal cues has been found to reduce the magnitude of the ab ( defined as the percentage of decrement in t2 performance within the ab period relative to t1 performance ) , presumably by redistribution or accelerated allocation of attention ( e.g. , [ 8 ] - [ 10 ]) .
as mentioned above , it has also been found that adding a source of distraction during the ab task can attenuate the ab. in an experiment by olivers and nieuwenhuis [ 4 ] , participants had to do an ab task in four different conditions .
in one condition , participants did a standard ab task .
in the other three conditions participants were financially rewarded for their performance , do free association ( e.g. , think about their most recent holiday ) or listen to music during the ab task .
in the latter two conditions , the ab was substantially reduced , while rewarding the participants did not make any difference .
although the initial finding could not be fully replicated [ 5 ] , others have shown that task - irrelevant visual motion or flicker [ 3 ] , a change in task instruction [ 11 ] , or even a concurrent secondary task [ 6 ] can attenuate the ab as well .
in the study of taatgen et al .
[ 6 ] , participants had to perform an ab task together with a concurrent secondary task that required participants to detect the occurrence of a red dot .
the ab task consisted of identifying target letters amongst distractor digits .
the detection task contained a grey dot presented in peripheral vision that moved in a circular direction concurrent to the stimulus stream of the ab task .
in 25 % of the trials , the grey dot turned red for a brief moment .
at the end of a trial , participants were instructed to report whether or not a red dot occurred during the trial .
trials in which the red dot actually turned red were excluded from analyses , as the red dot itself induced an ab. ab magnitude was found to be smaller in the concurrent task condition than in a control condition without dots .
supported by computer simulations , taatgen et al .
[ 6 ] argued that an ab might be caused by an overexertion of cognitive control , which is suspended when a secondary task is concurrently performed during the ab task .
in addition , their computational model provided a first explicit account of target selection processes in individuals who do not show an ab , referred to as ' non - blinkers' [ 12 ] .
whereas individual differences in ab research are usually ignored , martens , munneke , smid , and johnson [ 12 ] demonstrated the existence of large individual differences in the magnitude of the ab , with some individuals showing little or no ab whatsoever (' non - blinkers ') .
measuring event - related potentials ( erp ) , they found significant electrophysiological differences between non - blinkers and individuals who do show a strong ab (' blinkers ') .
more specifically , non - blinkers showed earlier target - related parietal activity ( reflected in the p3 , a component associated with the updating of working memory ) .
in addition , they exhibited more target - related frontal activity ( reflected in the fsp , a component associated with early target selection processes ) , as well as reduced distractor - related frontal activity .
martens , elmallah , london , and johnson [ 13 ] correlated the magnitude of the ab with the size of the p3 amplitude .
in their experiment , the frequency of the first target in a standard ab paradigm was manipulated .
whenever an infrequent first target was presented , the p3 amplitude evoked by t1 and the ab magnitude increased .
martens and colleagues suggested that the amplitude of the p3 of t1 reflects the amount of attention or resources allocated to consolidate t1 [ 13 ] - [ 16 ] and that the more resources allocated to t1 , the smaller the chance for t2 to receive sufficient attention , reflected in the occurrence of an ab. according to taatgen and colleagues [ 6 ] , most individuals tend to protect memory consolidation of a first target by temporarily blocking the detection of subsequent targets , resulting in an ab. they suggested that non - blinkers refrain from exerting this protective control , thus avoiding the ab. this notion could explain the paradoxical finding of improved performance during dual - tasking : when blinkers are given a secondary task during the ab , the brain might be taxed to such an extent that the exertion of protective control is relaxed , resulting in an attenuated ab ( also see [ 5 ]) .
an intriguing question is whether these ' induced non - blinkers' ( i.e. individuals showing a reduced ab magnitude due to distraction manipulations ) adopt a similar processing strategy as the natural non - blinkers reported by martens and colleagues [ 12 ] .
if so , induced non - blinkers should show similar patterns of frontal and parietal brain activity as previously observed in natural non - blinkers. that is , a shift in target - related p3 latencies would be expected , along with a larger target - related fsp component , as well as reduced distractor - related activity [ 12 ] .
in addition , because a lower p3 amplitude of the first target is associated with a smaller ab magnitude , one would expect the p3 amplitude to be lower in the concurrent tasks condition than in the standard ab task condition .
however , different patterns of brain activity might be expected if natural and induced non - blinkers are qualitatively different in the way they perform the ab task .
the aim of the current study was to test this and to reveal what influence the addition of a secondary task to a standard ab task has on the various components in the erp .
to that end , we adapted the task used by taatgen et al .
[ 6 ] to include event - related potential ( erp ) recordings , and investigated the fsp , p3 , and overall distractor - related activity .
contrary to taatgen et al. , we compared performance on trials in the experimental condition with that of trials in an additional control condition that featured identical input and only differed in task instructions , allowing a direct comparison of behavioral as well as erp data .
methods participants thirty psychology students from the university of groningen were recruited via an online sign - up program .
they received course credits for their participation in the experiment .
the neuroimaging center institutional review board and the ethics committee of psychology at the university of groningen approved the experimental protocol .
written informed consent was obtained prior to the experiment .
five participants were excluded from the analyses due to bad performance ( i.e. they had an accuracy < 50 % on the first target ) .
another participant was excluded from the analyses due to artifacts in more than 50 % of the eeg data segments .
the remaining twenty - four participants were aged 18 to 33 ( mean = 21.25 ) with normal or correct - to - normal visual acuity .
stimuli and apparatus the software package e - prime was used to generate stimuli and to collect responses , running under windows xp on a pc with a 17 - inch monitor .
stimuli consisted of consonants ( excluding " q " , " v " , and " y ") and digits ( excluding " 0 " and " 1 ") and were presented in black on a white background in a bold 12 - point courier new font subtending 0.3degrees by 0.4degrees of visual angle at a viewing distance of approximately 50 cm. in the ab task with grey dots distractors and in the ab task with red dot detection ( described below ) , grey ( 40.2 cd / m2 ) dots with a diameter of 10 pixels were used .
the red ( 28.8 cd / m2 ) dot used in the red dot detection task had the same size .
procedure the experiment consisted of four practice blocks and three experimental blocks containing one of three different tasks : a standard ab task , an ab task with a concurrently moving irrelevant peripheral grey dot ( grey dots task ) , or an ab task in which a short color change in the peripheral dot had to be detected ( red dot task ) , as described below .
the order of these blocks was counterbalanced between participants .
the first practice block always contained the standard ab task , and consisted of 108 trials .
in each subsequent testing block , participants performed one of the three different tasks , preceded by a practice block of that specific task .
one testing block ( containing the red dot task ) consisted of 288 trials whereas the other two blocks consisted of 216 trials .
each of the preceding practice blocks consisted of 12 trials. between each block , the participants could take a short break .
after half of the trials in each testing block , participants could take another short break .
the standard ab task required the identification of two letter targets amongst a rapid stream of digit distractors .
prior to each trial , a fixation cross was presented in the middle of the screen .
participants were instructed to fixate on the cross and to press the space bar to start the trial .
after pressing the space bar , the fixation cross remained on the screen for a duration of 750 ms , followed by a blank screen .
after 100 ms , a rapid serial visual presentation ( rsvp ) stream appeared in the middle of the screen , consisting of 22 sequentially presented stimuli .
each stimulus appeared for 90 ms without inter stimulus interval .
in two - thirds of the trials , two targets were presented .
in one - third of the trials , no targets were presented .
in all target trials , the first target ( t1 ) was presented as the fifth item in the stream , with the second target ( t2 ) appearing as either the third ( lag 3 ) or eighth ( lag 8 ) item following t1 .
known from the literature , an ab is likely to occur when t2 is presented at lag 3 ( i.e. 270 ms after t1 onset ) , and unlikely to occur when presented at lag 8 ( i.e. 720 ms after t1 onset ) .
the targets were randomly chosen from the set of target letters , with the only constraint that t1 and t2 were always different letters .
the distractors were randomly chosen from the set of digits with the constraint that two successive digits were never identical .
participants were instructed to report the two targets at the end of the stream by pressing the corresponding letters on the keyboard .
participants were instructed to take sufficient time in making their responses to ensure that typing errors were not made .
whenever participants did not see a target , they were instructed to press the spacebar instead .
participants were encouraged to type in the letters in the order in which they had been presented , but responses were accepted and counted correct in either order .
no feedback was given during the experiment .
the grey dots task was identical to the task described above , except that an irrelevant grey dot circled around the rsvp stream in synchrony with the presentation of each stimulus ( i.e. the dot moved every ~ 90 ms ) .
the grey dot started randomly at one of 39 possible positions in a radius of 11.3degrees from the middle of the screen .
the dot skipped two positions in clockwise rotation each time it moved .
participants were instructed to ignore the grey dot .
the red dot task was identical to the ab task with grey dots , except for the following changes .
participants were instructed to identify the targets in the ab task , while concurrently paying attention to the circling grey dot .
in 25 % of the trials , a red dot instead of a grey dot was presented for 90 ms , appearing once at a random time interval throughout the trial .
after having responded to the target letters , participants were required to report whether or not they had seen the occurrence of a red dot (" press ' j ' in case of a red dot , press ' n ' in case of no red dot ") .
importantly , only the trials during which no red dot appeared ( 75 % of the trials ) were considered in the analyses .
note that the perceptual input during these trials is identical to that in the ab task with irrelevant grey dots , with only the instructions being different .
as mentioned above , the block of the red dot task contained more trials to keep the number of trials without a red dot occurrence equal to the number of trials in the blocks of the standard and grey dots tasks .
although the order of the trials within each block was randomized , each condition ( lag 3 or 8 , targets or no targets , red dot present or absent ) was balanced within a testing block .
to reduce eye blink artifacts in the eeg recordings , participants were instructed to avoid making eye blinks during a trial until they were prompted to give their responses .
eeg recording the eeg signal was recorded using a 64 - channel electro - cap with tin electrodes .
the electro - cap was organized according to the international 10 / 20 system and connected to an refa 8 - 64 average reference amplifier .
impedance was reduced to less than 5komega for all electrodes .
data was sampled with a frequency of 2khz and digitally reduced to 500hz .
two electrodes connected to the mastoids served as an offline reference .
the horizontal electrooculogram ( eog ) was recorded from tin electrodes attached approximately 1 to 2 cm to the left and right of the outside corner of each eye .
the vertical eog was measured from two tin electrodes placed approximately 3 cm below the left eye and 1 cm above the brow of the left eye , respectively .
brain vision recorder ( brian products gmbh , munich , germany ) was used to control the data acquisition .
data analysis the preprocessing of the eeg data was done using brain vision analyzer ( brain products ) .
the erps were time locked to the onset of the rsvp stream , had a duration of 2000 ms , and were calculated relative to a 200 - ms prestream baseline , yielding a total length of 2200 ms. the erp - segments were 40 - hz low - pass and 0.2 - hz high - pass filtered , and corrected for eye - movements .
segments with value differences greater than 100microv ( i.e. , containing artifacts ) were excluded in the analysis .
artifact rejection excluded 5.7 % of all trials ( ranging from 0.19 % to 25.6 % per participant , sd = 6.4 ) .
both the performance and mean activity of the eeg data were analyzed using linear mixed effects models .
the peak latencies were determined by peak detection over the averages per participant , therefore repeated measures anovas were used to analyze peak latencies .
the use of mixed effect models in the field of ab research is new , but the method is widely used in other fields ( e.g. , psycholinguistics [ 17 ] , eye movement data [ 18 ] or memory research [ 19 ]) .
given that there are large individual differences in the ab and that our hypothesis predicted a different number of observations per cell , it was inappropriate to analyze results using a method that assumes an equal number of observations per cell [ 17 ] .
therefore , mixed - effects models were used to analyze most datasets , but repeated measures anovas were used to analyze the averaged latency data .
another advantage of mixed effect models is that these models are suited to analyze data from non - normal distributions , such as data based on accuracy scores [ 20 ] .
for the erp - based analyses , the default , normal distributions were used .
for the behavioral data , a binominal model was used to fit the accuracy scores .
the p - values reported for the non - binominal models of the eeg data were calculated by performing 10000 markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) samplings .
analyses were performed using the lmer and pvals.fnc functions in the lme4 and languager packages [ 17 ] , [ 21 ] for the statistical software r [ 22 ] .
for the analysis of the behavioral data , two mixed - effects models were fitted .
in the first model , both the grey dots and red dot tasks were compared to the standard task .
performance on lag 8 trials of the standard task was taken as reference in the first model .
in order to investigate differences between the grey dots task and the red dot task directly , a separate mixed - effects model was fitted on the accuracy data with exclusion of the standard task .
the grey dots task at lag 8 was taken as reference in this model .
the standard task was excluded from all eeg - data analyses because of the differences in perceptual input induced by the standard task compared to the grey dots and red dot task .
as the perceptual input of the grey dots and red dot task is identical , any differences found between the two tasks must be attributed to the manipulation of task instructions .
results and discussion behavioral results trials in the red dot task during which the red dot actually appeared were excluded from the analysis .
on such trials , the red dot itself could possibly induce an ab on the first or second target .
detection accuracy for presence of the red dot was 65.1 % ( sd = 29.3 ) .
figure 1 shows the identification performance on the ab tasks as a function of lag for t1 and t2 given that t1 was correctly reported ( t2 | t1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0015024.g001 figure 1 accuracy scores of the standard , grey dots and red dot task for t2 given t1 is correct on lag 8 ( dashed line ) and on lag 3 ( solid line ) .
t1 accuracy two binominal mixed effects model were fitted on the accuracy of t1 with task entered as fixed factor .
subject was entered as a random factor .
the first model was fitted on all three tasks , using performance on the standard task at lag 8 as reference .
in the second model , data of the standard task were left out in order to directly compare the grey dots task versus the red dot task .
table 1 lists the estimates and z - statistics of the first model .
the estimates of the coefficients are reported in log odds .
the coefficients of task for the grey dots task and red dot task were not significant in the model , suggesting that both tasks did not affect overall performance .
in the second model , the grey dots task was directly compared to the red dot task .
in this model , also no significant effect of task was found .

as in the analyses of t1 , two models were fitted with lag and task entered as fixed factors , and subject as random factor .
as in the analysis of t1 accuracy , the data of the standard task were left out of the analyses in the second model .
the estimates and z - statistics of the first model are listed in table 2 .
a main effect of lag was found , such that performance was lower at lag 3 than at lag 8 , reflecting the occurrence of an ab. no main effect of task was found .
however , significant lagxtask interaction effects were found with a positive direction for the red dot task relative to performance on the standard task , reflecting that at lag 3 target performance was higher in the red dot task than in the standard task .
no significant differences were found between the standard task and the grey dots task .
a second model comparing the grey dots task and the red dot task directly reveals similar differences as found in the first model .
again , a main effect of lag is found ( z = - 11.524 , p = 0.000 ) , indicating the presence of the ab effect .
in addition , a significant lagxtask interaction was found , ( z = 2.047 , p = 0.041 ) , such that lag 3 performance was better in the red dot task than in the grey dots task .
no main effect of task was found ( p = 0.442 ) .
taken together , a smaller ab effect was observed in the red dot condition compared to the standard ab task and the grey dots task .
although performance seemed better in the grey dots task than in the standard task ( see figure 1 ) , no significant difference was found .
the grey dots task thus seemed to be a suitable control task for comparison with the red dot task in the erp analyses .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0015024.t002 table 2 the estimates and z - values of the mixed - effects model for t2 | t1 accuracy .

as behavioral performance was similar in the standard ab and the grey dots tasks , we included only the grey dots task and the red dot task in the erp analyses , as both task included the same perceptual input ( as mentioned before , red - dot present trials were excluded from all analyses ) .
because the p3 was maximal at the pz electrode , this electrode was used to analyze p3 activity .
based on visual inspection of the grand averages , a time window of 320 - 640 ms after target onset was used to determine p3 amplitude ( in terms of mean activity ) .
for each individual and condition , the latencies of the p3 peaks were obtained by searching for the maximum peak in the before - mentioned time window per condition - based average .
to determine the fsp amplitudes , target - and distractor - related activity was analyzed in a window of 180 - 340 ms after the onset of t1 .
target - related activity was obtained by taking activity within that window on trials during which t1 was successfully reported , whereas distractor - related activity was obtained by taking the activity of the non - target trials within the same time window .
the p3 on lag 8 trials figure 2 shows the grand averages of activity at pz during lag 8 trials , given that t1 and t2 were both correctly identified .
the p3 activity of both t1 and t2 was analyzed using a mixed effect model .
task ( grey dots or red dot ) and target ( t1 or t2 ) were entered in the model as fixed factors .
as in the analyses of the behavioral data , subject was entered as a random factor .
the estimates of the model are listed in table 3 .
in the model , there was a significant effect of the red dot task .
whenever participants were engaged in the red dot task , p3 mean activity was lower than in the grey dots task .
to determine whether the decrement in activity was specific for the p3 component , a second analysis was performed with a baseline from - 200 to the onset of the p3 component ( i.e. 680 ms ) .
again , there was a significant difference in p3 amplitude between the grey dots task and the red dot task ( t = - 3.386 , p = 0.000 ) , suggesting that there was indeed a target - specific decrement in activity on top of a possible overall reduction in activity .
a separate repeated measures anova on the p3 peak latencies of the first target with task as within - subjects factor did not reveal any significant difference between the tasks ( f < 1 ) .

to investigate the effect of task on the amplitude p3 of t1 and t2 , all lag 3 trials in which t1 was correctly reported were analyzed using a mixed - effects model .
target ( t1 or t2 ) and task were entered as fixed factors .
subject was entered as a random factor .
the estimates and t - values of the coefficients of both models can be found in table 4 .
a significant effect of task was found , such that the p3 was smaller in the red dot task than in the grey dots task .
neither a significant difference was found for target nor for the interaction between task and target .
again , a second analysis was performed with a baseline from - 200 to 680 ms to see whether an analysis corrected for a possible overall negativity would yield similar results .
a significant effect of the red dot task on p3 amplitude was obtained ( t = - 2.205 , p = 0.027 ) , suggesting that the target - specific decrement in activity found on lag 8 trials was also present on lag 3 trials .
a repeated measures anova of the p3 latencies with task as within - factor did not reveal any significant main effects or interactions ( f < 1 ) .

a significant effect was found for targets ( t = 3.328 , p = 0.002 ) , indicating the presence of a significant fsp in all three tasks .
no other main effects or interactions were found to be significant ( ps > 0.17 ) .
to determine peak latency , the latency of the maximum positive peak within the time window of 180 - 340 ms after target onset was taken .
a repeated measures anova with task as within - subjects factor did not reveal a significant difference in peak latency ( p > 0.32 ) general discussion previous research has shown that distracting participants during an ab task improves performance in identifying t2 during the blink period [ 3 ] - [ 6 ] .
in the current study , behavioral as well as electrophysiological effects of a red dot detection task on a concurrent ab task were investigated .
performance in this dual task setting ( referred to as the red dot task ) was compared to that in a single ab task ( standard task ) .
as a second control condition , a task with similar perceptual input as in the red dot task was also included in the experiment ( grey dots task ) .
in contrast to the red dot detection task , the dots that appeared in the latter task were simply to be ignored .
compared to both control tasks , participants showed an attenuated ab in the red dot task .
this result is in line with previous findings reported by taatgen [ 6 ] and colleagues , despite various small methodological differences between the experiments ( i.e. , in counterbalancing the order of conditions , the presence of feedback , and the number of lags , distractors , and targets ) .
most importantly , we found evidence that the p3 amplitudes induced by successfully identified targets were reduced during both lag 3 and lag 8 trials of the red dot task .
the finding that p3 amplitude decreases when engaged in a second task is in line with these results [ 16 ] .
the finding of reduced p3 amplitudes corresponds nicely with previous reports of a relationship between p3 amplitude and ab magnitude [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
whereas martens et al. manipulated p3 amplitude using cuing and stimulus probability , mcarthur et al. changed the response set size of t1 .
both research groups found that a larger p3 coincided with a larger ab magnitude .
more evidence is provided by a meg study , in which a positive correlation was found between an individual 's p3 ( or m300 ) amplitude and ab magnitude [ 15 ] .
martens et al .
[ 12 ] specifically focused on individual differences in ab magnitude by studying a group of so - called ' non - blinkers ' , who show little or no ab , and a group of strong ' blinkers ' , who show a large ab magnitude .
compared to blinkers , non - blinkers showed more target - related frontal activity ( reflected in the fsp component ) , less distractor - related frontal activity ( on target - absent trials ) , and earlier peak latencies of the target - induced p3s .
martens and colleagues argued that non - blinkers consolidate relevant information quicker ( evidenced by the earlier p3 peak latencies ) , presumably because they are capable of making an early selection , discriminating targets from distractors at an early stage of processing ( reflected in increased target - related and decreased distractor - related frontal activity ) .
an important question that we wanted to address in the current study was whether distraction during the ab task turns blinkers into non - blinkers .
the answer to that question seems to be a tentative " no " .
firstly , although there was a significant reduction in ab magnitude in the red dot task , participants in the current study still showed a much larger ab than the non - blinkers did in previous studies [ 8 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 23 ] .
although , like the non - blinkers , participants in the red dot detection task showed a significant reduction in distractor - related activity , this reduction was most prominent over occipital rather than frontal brain areas .
in addition , neither a change in p3 peak latency nor in fsp amplitude was observed in the current study .
these findings may thus be taken to suggest that ' natural ' non - blinkers and the ' induced non - blinkers' from the current study differ fundamentally in the way they perform the ab task .
as suggested in a recent study by martens , korucuoglu , smid , and nieuwenstein [ 24 ] , natural non - blinkers might be more efficient than blinkers to take advantage of overlearned category - level features to select targets prior to full identification , allowing natural non - blinkers to ignore rather than suppress distractors , thereby avoiding an ab ( also see taatgen et al. [ 6 ]) .
the picture that tentatively emerges is that the amplitude of the p3 induced by t1 plays an important role in determining whether an ab occurs .
polich [ 25 ] argued that p3 amplitude is related to inhibition processes occurring in the brain .
the function of this inhibition process is speculated to protect the target stimulus from interference by competing stimuli .
given the existence of non - blinkers and supported by computer simulations , taatgen et al .
[ 6 ] hypothesized that this inhibition / protection is in fact unnecessary .
any reduction in p3 amplitude ( or shift in latency ) may imply that less inhibition is exerted on the items following t1 , including t2 , thereby increasing the chance of successful t2 report .
not only is this in line with what we observed in the red dot task , this view is also consistent with many theories that attribute the ab to an inhibition process that is induced while the first target is being consolidated ( e.g. , [ 6 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 26 ] - [ 28 ]) .
in addition to a reduction of target - related parietal activity , we also found a reduction of distractor - related occipital activity .
research on sensory - evoked responses in early visuocortical processing has shown that increased perceptual load results in smaller p1 amplitudes ( a component associated with early attention processes [ 29 ]) at the occipital sites , accompanied by a reduction of distractor interference on target processing [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
to summarize , we found that the ab is attenuated by the addition of a secondary task .
in addition , a target - specific reduction in p3 amplitude was found on top of a general decrement in overall distractor - related activity .
the presence of a secondary task in the present study presumably increased the perceptual / cognitive load , thus leading to reduced distractor processing ( reflected in the reduced distractor - related occipital activity ) .
we conclude that this reduction in distractor processing in turn leads to a reduced ' need ' for inhibitory processes later in the processing pathway ( reflected in reduced p3s ) , and therefore a reduced ab. the present findings bring us a step closer in understanding why and how an ab occurs , and how these temporal restrictions in selective attention can be overcome .

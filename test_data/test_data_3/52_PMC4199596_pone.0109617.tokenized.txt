background protein supplementation has been shown to reduce the increases in intrahepatic triglyceride ( ihtg ) content induced by acute hypercaloric high - fat and high - fructose diets in humans .
objective to assess the effect of a 12 - wk iso - energetic high protein - low carbohydrate ( hplc ) diet compared with an iso - energetic high carbohydrate - low protein ( hclp ) diet on ihtg content in healthy non - obese subjects , at a constant body weight .
design seven men and nine women [ mean +/ - sd age : 24 +/ - 5 y ; bmi : 22.9 +/ - 2.1 kg / m2 ] were randomly allocated to a hplc [ 30 / 35 / 35 % of energy ( en %) from protein / carbohydrate / fat ] or a hclp ( 5 / 60 / 35 en %) diet by stratification on sex , age and bmi .
dietary guidelines were prescribed based on individual daily energy requirements .
ihtg content was measured by 1h - magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after the dietary intervention .
results ihtg content changed in different directions with the hplc ( ch2h2o : 0.23 +/ - 0.17 to 0.20 +/ - 0.10 ; ihtg % : 0.25 +/ - 0.20 % to 0.22 +/ - 0.11 %) compared with the hclp diet ( ch2h2o : 0.34 +/ - 0.20 vs. 0.38 +/ - 0.21 ; ihtg % : 0.38 +/ - 0.22 % vs. 0.43 +/ - 0.24 %) , which resulted in a lower ihtg content in the hplc compared with the hclp diet group after 12 weeks , which almost reached statistical significance ( p = 0.055 ) .
conclusions a hplc vs. a hclp diet has the potential to preserve vs. enlarge ihtg content in healthy non - obese subjects at a constant body weight .

introduction energy - restricted high - protein diets are commonly applied as interventions aiming to induce body weight loss and related improvements in metabolic profile [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
on the other hand , high carbohydrate - high fat diets may increase the susceptibility for overeating , which may result in the development of metabolic disturbances [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
visceral adipose tissue ( vat ) volume has been linked to the metabolic disturbances associated with obesity , such as a diminished insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia [ 6 ] .
however , high ectopic lipid content , especially intrahepatic triglyceride ( ihtg ) content , and not vat volume , is an independent risk factor for these metabolic disturbances [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
in obese subjects , increases in bmi , total adipose tissue volume , or vat volume were only associated with increases in insulin resistance and disturbances in very - low - density lipoprotein ( vldl ) - tg metabolism when ihtg content was increased simultaneously [ 9 ] .
furthermore , insulin sensitivity was lower and vldl secretion was higher in obese subjects with a high ihtg content (> 5.5 % of liver volume ) , matched on vat volume [ 8 ] .
no differences were observed between subjects with a high vat volume (> 1 100 cm3 ) but similar ihtg content [ 8 ] .
therefore , measuring ihtg content as a marker of metabolic function in dietary intervention studies is highly relevant .
several human studies suggest that high protein intake may modulate ihtg content .
a 4 - wk uncontrolled study showed that protein supplementation was associated with a reduction in ihtg content in obese subjects [ 10 ] .
in two short - term dietary intervention studies , protein supplementation reduced the increases in ihtg content induced by hypercaloric high - fat and high - fructose diets in healthy subjects [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
however , the longer - term effects of dietary protein content on ihtg content , thereby excluding the possible effects of metabolic disturbances and changes in body weight are unknown .
therefore , in the context of prevention of metabolic disturbances , the aim of this dietary intervention study was to assess the effect of a 12 - wk iso - energetic high protein - low carbohydrate ( hplc ) diet compared with an iso - energetic high carbohydrate - low protein ( hclp ) diet on ihtg content in healthy non - obese subjects , at a constant body weight .
subjects and methods the medical ethical committee of maastricht university approved the study , and all subjects gave written informed consent .
the study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with identifier : nct01551238 .
the protocol for this trial and supporting consort checklist are available as supporting information ; see checklist s1 and protocol s1 .
study subjects based on the study by thetaz et al .
[ 12 ] , power analysis showed that with an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.80 , at least 7 subjects per group were needed to show a difference in ihtg content between the dietary interventions of this study .
twenty - four subjects were recruited by advertisements in local newspapers and on notice boards at the university .
data from measurements of four subjects were unreliable , and were therefore excluded from analysis .
four subjects had to be excluded from the data analysis because of non - compliance with the designated protein intake , as shown by the urinary nitrogen biomarker .
the baseline characteristics of the excluded subjects did not differ from the total sample .
overall , 16 subjects ( 7 men and 9 women ) were included in the final data analysis ( figure 1 ) .

subjects underwent a screening that included anthropometric measurements and the completion of questionnaires eliciting information about health , smoking behaviour , use of medications , and alcohol consumption .
subjects were aged between 19 and 31 y had a bmi between 19.0 and 25.3 kg / m2 .
age and bmi were equally divided between males and females .
subjects were non - smoking , not using more than moderate amounts of alcohol (> 10 drinks / wk ) , were weight stable ( body weight change < 3 kg during the last 6 mo and had no planned weight change during the study period ) , and were not using medication or supplements except for oral contraceptives in women .
the validated dutch translation of the baecke activity questionnaire was used to measure habitual physical activity scores , which were converted into a standardized individual physical activity level [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
dietary intervention the study used a single - blind parallel design in which subjects were randomly allocated to the hplc [ 30 / 35 / 35 % of energy ( en %) from protein / carbohydrate / fat ] or the hclp ( 5 / 60 / 35 en %) diet following stratification on sex , age and bmi .
detailed dietary guidelines were prescribed based on individual daily energy requirements , calculated as the basal metabolic rate determined with the formula of harris and benedict [ 15 ] times the physical activity level [ 16 ] .
this was carried out in order to keep body weight constant .
moreover , subjects were told that they were expected to maintain their body weight and physical activity level .
the dietary guidelines included a variety of recipes for breakfasts , lunches , dinners and snacks , consisting of commercially available food items and the amounts that had to be consumed to reach the intended diet compositions .
the guidelines included the prescription to consume additional protein [ hplc : whey with alpha - lactalbumin ( hiprotal whey protein alpha , frieslandcampina domo emea , amersfoort , the netherlands )] or carbohydrate [ hclp : maltodextrin ( fantomalt , nutricia , zoetermeer , the netherlands )] by shakes twice daily ( table 1 ) .

body weight and biomarker of protein intake at baseline and at weeks 5 , 9 and 12 , body weight was measured by using a digital balance in order to check whether it remained constant , and 24 - h urinary nitrogen excretion was determined as biomarker of protein intake throughout the intervention period .
ihtg content mri and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1h - mrs ) measurements were performed using a 1.5 - t whole - body scanner ( intera ; philips healthcare , best , the netherlands ) .
sagittal , coronal and transversal images through the right lobe in the lower third of the liver were obtained by mri ( slice thickness 8 mm ; repetition time / echo time , 500 / 15 ms ; matrix 180x96 ) in order to gain anatomical and positional information of the liver , 1h - mrs enabled to measure ihtg content by distinguishing hepatic water from a spectrum of ihtg .
fatty acid chains that represent different proton moiety were separated by the relative magnitude of resonance [ 17 ] .
a 20x20x20 mm volume of interest was positioned , avoiding the lateral margin of the liver parenchyma , major blood vessels , and intrahepatic bile ducts .
the position of the volume of interest was the same at the baseline measurement and at the measurement after the intervention .
following shimming ( 10x10x10 cm volume ) , eight spectra were acquired using a q - body coil [ 18 ] .
point - resolved spectroscopy sequence ( press ) was used for spatial localization and signal acquisition using a protocol set up by schrauwen - hinderling et al ( repetition time / echo time , 4000 / 33 ms ; number of signals averaged fat / water , 64 / 16 ) [ 19 ] .
water signal was suppressed using 150 hz frequency - selective prepulses .
the unsuppressed water signal was measured in the same volume of interest under the same shimming conditions , and was used as a reference signal [ 19 ] .
spectra were fitted using the java - based magnetic resonance user interface ( jmrui ) package fitted in the domain using a non - linear least - squares algorithm ( amares ) [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
areas of resonance from protons of methylene [ - ( ch2 ) n - ] and methyl ( ch3 ) in the fatty acid chains , relative to the area of protons of h2o , were used as a measure for the ihtg content .
a more extensive description of the applied post processing procedure has been published previously [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed by using spss version 20 for macintosh os x ( spss inc. ) .
differences in subject characteristics and anthropometrics between the diet groups were assessed using factorial anova .
mann - whitney tests were used to test for differences in ihtg content between the diet groups .
factorial anovas with repeated measures were used to test whether nitrogen excretion , body weight , and bmi changed over time within the diet groups , and to test whether these effects differed between the diet groups .
data on ihtg content were log transformed before these statistical analyses were performed .
differences were regarded statistically significant if p < 0.05 .
data are presented as mean +/ - sd. results subject characteristics subject characteristics did not differ between the diet groups at baseline ( table 2 ) .
no adverse events were reported .

body weight and biomarker of protein intake the condition of stable body weight was met in both arms .
baseline nitrogen excretion did not differ significantly between the hplc ( 12.2 +/ - 3.6 g / d ) and hclp ( 11.4 +/ - 3.4 g / d ) diets .
nitrogen excretion increased significantly in the hplc ( 23.3 +/ - 4.4 g / d , p < 0.05 ) , and decreased in the hclp ( 6.5 +/ - 1.3 g / d , p = 0.001 ) diet group compared with baseline .
significant differences in protein intake between the diet groups were confirmed in that nitrogen excretion differed significantly between the diet groups throughout the intervention period ( p = 0.001 ) .
ihtg content ihtg content decreased with the hplc ( ch2h2o : 0.23 +/ - 0.17 to 0.20 +/ - 0.10 ; ihtg % : 0.25 +/ - 0.20 % to 0.22 +/ - 0.11 %) and increased with the hclp diet ( ch2h2o : 0.34 +/ - 0.20 vs. 0.38 +/ - 0.21 ; ihtg % : 0.38 +/ - 0.22 % vs. 0.43 +/ - 0.24 %) , although not reaching statistical significance ( table 2 ) .
these changes of ihtg content in different directions resulted in a lower ihtg content in the hplc compared with the hclp diet group after 12 weeks , which almost reached statistical significance ( p = 0.055 ) .
discussion protein supplementation has been shown to reduce the increases in ihtg content induced by acute hypercaloric high - fat and high - fructose diets in humans .
in the context of prevention of metabolic disturbances , we assessed the longer - term effects of iso - energetic diets with large contrasts in relative protein content on ihtg content in healthy non - obese subjects , thereby excluding the possible effects of changes in body weight .
the present study showed that ihtg content changed in different directions with the hplc compared with the hclp diet , which resulted in a lower ihtg content in the hplc compared with the hclp diet group after 12 weeks , which almost reached statistical significance .
the observation that the condition of stable body weight was met in both diet groups confirmed that this observation was not affected by changes in body weight .
the successful implementation of the dietary intervention in each diet group was confirmed by urinary nitrogen concentrations .
a proposed mechanism for the modulation of ihtg content by a high protein intake is the stimulation of hepatic lipid oxidation due to the high energetic demand for amino acid catabolism and ketogenesis [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
hepatic lipid oxidation may also be stimulated by an increased bile acid production in response to high protein intake , a process that may also inhibit lipogenesis [ 26 ] .
furthermore , protein - induced glucagon secretion inhibits de novo lipogenesis and stimulates hepatic ketogenesis [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
on the other hand , previous studies showed that hyper - and eucaloric high - carbohydrate diets stimulated the synthesis of fatty acids from dietary glucose via de novo lipogenesis [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
the carbohydrate - induced de novo lipogenesis correlated with plasma tg concentrations [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
increased ihtg deposition was shown to be the result of hepatic tg - synthesis exceeding the rate of its secretion into vldl [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
the relationship between high carbohydrate intake and increased vldl - tg concentrations , possibly caused by stimulation of vldl - tg production and inhibition of vldl - tg clearance [ 33 ] , may result in increases in hepatic tg concentrations , and subsequently in ihtg content [ 31 ] .
protein supplementation has been observed to blunt the increase in ihtg content induced by short - term hypercaloric high - fructose intake in healthy subjects [ 12 ] .
therefore , it is likely that the observed trend for a difference in ihtg content after the consumption of the hplc compared with the hclp diet may be the result of combined effects involving changes in protein and carbohydrate intake .
the strength of the present study was the application of an iso - energetic macronutrient intervention for a period that was long enough to reliably measure changes in ihtg content , thereby excluding the possible effects of metabolic disturbances and changes in body weight .
our healthy , non - obese subjects had a low ihtg content at baseline , which relates to a healthy metabolic function .
this may exhibit a strong resistance to metabolic changes in response to dietary interventions when stimuli such as a high - fat or a high - fructose intake are absent [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
this indicates that high protein - low carbohydrate diets may be biologically less relevant for inducing a significant decrease in ihtg content in healthy subjects .
nevertheless , the observations of this study are relevant by suggesting that high protein - low carbohydrate diets may be beneficial for the prevention of metabolic disturbances in healthy subjects .
measurements of energy expenditure , body composition , body fat distribution including ectopic fat deposition , and metabolic function are needed to assess the translation of high - protein diets as a treatment strategy into a preventive measure. by addressing ectopic fat deposition in response to dietary interventions , this study adds to the discussion of the clinical relevance of dietary protein for the prevention of obesity .
it would also be relevant to implement the measurement of ihtg content in studies assessing the effects of high - protein diets during body weight loss and weight maintenance in patients with metabolic disturbances .
to conclude , a hplc vs. a hclp diet has the potential to preserve vs. enlarge ihtg content in healthy non - obese subjects at a constant body weight .

objective to project the hiv / aids epidemics among men who have sex with men ( msm ) under different combinations of hiv testing and linkage to care ( tlc ) interventions including antiretroviral therapy ( art ) in beijing , china .
design mathematical modeling .
methods using a mathematical model to fit prevalence estimates from 2000 - 2010 , we projected trends in hiv prevalence and incidence during 2011 - 2020 under five scenarios : ( s1 ) current intervention levels by averaging 2000 - 2010 coverage ; ( s2 ) increased art coverage with current tlc ; ( s3 ) increased tlc / art coverage ; ( s4 ) increased condom use ; and ( s5 ) increased tlc / art plus increased condom use .
results the basic reproduction number based upon the current level of interventions is significantly higher than 1 ( confidence interval ( ci ) , 1.83 - 2.35 ) , suggesting that the hiv epidemic will continue to increase to 2020 .
compared to the 2010 prevalence of 7.8 % , the projected hiv prevalence in 2020 for the five prevention scenarios will be : ( s1 ) current coverage : 21.4 % ( 95 % ci , 9.9 - 31.7 %) ; ( s2 ) increased art : 19.9 % ( 95 % ci , 9.9 - 28.4 %) ; ( s3 ) increased tlc / art : 14.5 % ( 95 % ci , 7.0 - 23.8 %) ; ( s4 ) increased condom use : 13.0 % ( 95 % ci , 9.8 - 28.4 %) ; and ( s5 ) increased tlc / art and condom use : 8.7 % ( 95 % ci , 5.4 - 11.5 %) .
hiv epidemic will continue to rise () for s1 - s4 even with hyperbolic coverage in the sensitivity analysis , and is expected to decline () for s5 .
conclusion our transmission model suggests that beijing msm will have a rapidly rising hiv epidemic .
even enhanced levels of tlc / art will not interrupt epidemic expansion , despite optimistic assumptions for coverage .
promoting condom use is a crucial component of combination interventions .

introduction more than 30 years have passed since the first hiv case was reported among men who have sex with men ( msm ) [ 1 ] .
msm contribute to the majority of new cases in the americas , western europe , oceania , and much of asia [ 2 ]. of the 780,000 people living with hiv / aids in china , 17.4 % were infected through homosexual contacts in 2011 , rising from 11.0 % in 2007 and 7.3 % in 2005 [ 3 ] .
a recent survey among 47,231 msm from 61 chinese cities showed an overall prevalence of 4.9 % [ 4 ] .
the unrelenting hiv burden among msm suggests that hiv intervention remains an urgent priority .
one promising concept is the expansion of hiv testing and linkage to care ( tlc ) including antiretroviral therapy ( art ) , so that a much higher proportion of infected men know their hiv status and undergo art , thereby reducing their infectiousness to others [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
china has implemented several aggressive public health programs in the past decade , including routine hiv testing and risk reduction interventions for high risk populations and free art for hiv - infected treatment - eligible individuals [ 10 ] .
these programs curtailed hiv transmission through unhygienic plasma collection and injecting drug use , and reduced mortality among hiv - infected patients [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] ; however , no programs have reversed the rising hiv epidemic among chinese msm [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
a recently published mathematic model estimated that a four - fold increase in testing rates may prevent 42,000 new hiv infections among all at - risk groups in china over 5 years [ 16 ] .
a few mathematical models evaluated independent or joint impacts of hiv testing , risk reduction intervention and art among msm [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , but these studies were mainly from the americas , western europe , and australia , where the hiv epidemics have been long established among msm , and none from regions with a rapidly rising hiv epidemic among msm .
art may not have the same protection against hiv transmission in homosexual contacts as in heterosexual contacts due to biological and behavioral differences in infectiousness / susceptibility or differences in co - factor frequency [ 25 ] .
furthermore , the effectiveness of combined tlc intervention packages may be contingent on the epidemiological context [ 26 ] .
in this study , we modeled the dynamics of the hiv / aids epidemic among msm in china 's capital city , beijing , which is representative of most chinese urban areas [ 4 ] .
we simulated hiv prevalence from 2000 - 2010 based on the coverage and intensity of existing public health programs including uptake of hiv testing , linkage to hiv care ( e.g. risk reduction ) , art and condom use .
further , we made projections for the hiv epidemic beyond 2010 under various intervention scenarios .
we then examined the robustness of model predictions based on different underlying assumptions in sensitivity analyses .
methods we used a compartmental ordinary differential equations model for simulating and projecting the hiv epidemic among msm in beijing .
instead of the bilinear incidence [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and the standard incidence models [ 5 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , we used bernoulli processes to describe the probability of hiv transmission [ 30 ] .
bernoulli processes can more accurately describe the hiv transmission network among msm by giving consideration for multiple sexual partners , type of sexual partner ( i.e. , regular or casual ) , differential condom use , and probability of transmission by preferred anal sex position ( i.e. , receptive or insertive ) .
substance abuse is rare among msm in beijing ; therefore , injecting drug use is unlikely to contribute substantially to hiv transmission [ 31 ],[ 32 ],[ 33 ] .
additionally , some chinese msm may have female sexual partners , but these female partners generally do not have risky behavior and are unlikely to transmit disease to male partners [ 34 ] .
therefore , we only considered hiv transmission as a result of homosexual contact ; we implicitly assumed there is no other route of transmission [ 31 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 35 ] .
we also assumed that the age of active homosexual intercourse ranges from 18 - 60 years among chinese msm [ 36 ] .
model structure receipt of hiv testing and risk reduction services may change the risk of hiv transmission among msm .
thus , we divided the study population into three mutually exclusive sub - populations : those who are not testing for hiv ( non - testing ) , those who are testing but not reducing their risk of infection / transmission ( testing ) , and those who are testing and reducing their risk of infection / transmission ( risk reduction ) .
the population was further compartmentalized by infection status and disease status ( or eligibility for art treatment ) .
according to chinese national art guidelines [ 37 ] , patients with cd4 + t cell count < 350 cells / microl are eligible for art treatment .
figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of our compartmental model structure .
in this model we assumed that uninfected msm enter the model as susceptible () ( these msm could be local beijing residents who turn 18 years old , or those who migrate from other areas to beijing ) .
some who receive hiv testing may test negative () , and then a proportion of those hiv - negative men are linked to care and receive risk reduction intervention provided by public health programs in beijing () .
the subscripts refer to the non - testing , testing , and risk reduction , respectively .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0090985.g001 figure 1 schematic diagram of hiv combination prevention intervention model in the presence of art .
the top row of compartments show uninfected msm who are susceptible to hiv infection .
they are divided into non - testers , testers , and testers who received risk reduction and linkage - to - care interventions .
the bottom two rows representing two stages of disease contain an additional compartment - - infected individuals .
stage 1 is cd4 + cell count < 350 / microl while stage 2 is cd4 + >= 350 / microl .
the last column of compartments shows hiv - infected individuals who have initiated antiretroviral therapy. is the recruitment rate per year into the msm population in beijing .
they are local hiv - msm who turn 18 years old , or those from other areas who immigrate to beijing .
horizontal movement is parameterized by rates of testing () , rates of linkage to care () , rates of art initiation () , and rates of art failure or dropout () .
movement from susceptible to infected () is the hiv transmission rate .
it is estimated from multiple parameters including condom use , insertive / receptive intercourse , regular / casual partner encounter , cd4 count , and reductions in infectivity due to tlc or art .
the natural removal rate () represents death , being older than 60 years , or migration out of beijing .
the rate of disease progression is different for hiv - infected individuals on art () or not on art () .
upon infection , individuals move from susceptible into infected status , and the latter is further divided into two infection stages : cd4 count >= 350 / microl ( and ) and cd4 count < 350 / microl ( and ) .
flow is unidirectional from susceptible status to infection stage 1 and then 2 , as without art , an hiv - infected individual is unlikely to experience immunological recovery .
a proportion of infected msm ( or ) receive art ( or ) ; these compartments are bidirectional due to attrition or adherence to art and decline or improvement of immunological status .
the key to quantifying hiv incidence among msm in beijing is specifying the time - dependent hiv transmission rate , . multiplying the number of susceptible msm by this transmission rate gives the frequency of new infections .
since msm in beijing often have multiple sexual partners , we classified them as regular partners ( rp ) and casual partners ( cp ) , because they typically have different risk profiles [ 32 ] , [ 35 ] .
we also classified sexual behaviors of msm as insertive or receptive anal intercourse ( ai ) with different hiv transmission probabilities per sex act [ 8 ] .
we investigated the relationship between per - act and per - partner ai transmission probabilities for a given number of sex acts using the bernoulli process assuming independence of risk for each sex act within a partnership [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .

using the bernoulli process model of hiv transmission during a given number of sex acts , the non - infection probability by infected regular sexual partners through receptive ai and insertive ai () under condom - use rate can be described as : ( 1 ) where r is the proportion of sex acts which are insertive ai and theta is the single act transmission probability , and and are the mean number of sex acts and condom use rates with superscripts r ( above ) or c ( not shown ) denoting regular or casual sex partnerships , respectively .
the hiv transmission rate is defined as : ( 2 ) where is the effective contact rate for all msm n at time t with ( 3 ) the definitions for parameters in the equation ( 3 ) are described in table 1. from this model , we calculated the basic reproduction number () [ 40 ]. is the number of secondary cases produced by a typical hiv - infected msm during his entire period of infectiousness in a demographically steady susceptible population .
calculating is critical to determine whether hiv will increase , stabilize , or decline among the msm population in beijing .
data source and estimation to simulate the hiv prevalence rates during 2000 - 2010 among msm in beijing , we used data from local hiv surveillance systems and published studies [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 41 ] .
as these data were summary statistics , and did not include any identifiers that could link the data to individual subjects in the local hiv surveillance systems or participants from the published studies , consent was waived and the mathematical modeling protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the national center for aids / std control and prevention of chinese center for disease control and prevention and vanderbilt university .
we employed a metropolis - hastings algorithm to carry out extensive markov - chain monte - carlo simulations for estimating the mean values of some unknown parameters [ 42 ] , including yearly recruitment rate ( or number of new members into the pool of the study population each year ) , risk - reduction rate of healthy msm ( during 2000 - 2010 ) , relative infectiousness of risk - reduction to non - testing subgroups , the per - act probability of unprotected insertive or receptive anal intercourse resulting in an infection , and the relative infectiousness ratio of hiv positive msm in the infection stages 2 to 1 ( see figure 1 ) .
the algorithm ran for 1,000,000 iterations , and we adapted the proposal distribution after 500,000 iterations using geweke 's method to assess convergence [ 42 ] .
initial conditions the earliest hiv prevalence data among msm in beijing were available for 2000 .
the observed hiv prevalence rates among msm in beijing during 2000 - 2010 were : 1.2 % in 2000 [ 41 ] , 3.2 % in 2005 [ 32 ] , 4.8 % in 2006 [ 32 ] , 5.1 % in 2007 [ 32 ] , 6.5 % in 2008 [ 31 ] , [ 33 ] , 6.8 % in 2009 [ 35 ] , and 7.8 % in 2010 [ 43 ] .
in order to set the initial conditions , we had to estimate the target population of msm living in beijing in 2000 .
according the national census in 2000 , there were 14 million of people living in beijing .
we assumed half of them were male and 3 % of males in beijing in 2000 were msm , of which half lived in the city .
the testing rate in 2010 was very low ( assumed 0.125 %) .
also , we assumed there was no risk reduction intervention in 2000 , as the burgeoning hiv epidemic in msm did not receive attention from chinese public health programs at that time [ 44 ] .
for these non - testing hiv - positive msm , we assumed one - third were in infection stage 1 ( cd4 count >= 350 / microl ) and two - thirds were in the infection stage 2 ( cd4 count < 350 / microl ) .
also , we assumed that there was no art available for msm in 2000 .
the resulting parameter values for the initial conditions are shown in table 1 .
progression with an 18 year average age of sexual debut , we considered a natural removal rate per year which corresponds to an average of 42 years of sexual activity and non - aids mortality () .
the recruitment rate per year into hiv - negative msm population was estimated to range from 2 - 6.4 % of the total population [ 8 ] giving the recruitment rate () ( table 1 ) .
the progression duration from hiv infection to aids is 10 - 12 years in the absence of treatment and may increase by additional 8 - 12 years with art [ 5 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .
we used estimated disease progression rates being an average duration of 5.6 years without art ( therefore , ) , and 11.2 years with art () [ 5 ] .
we also performed sensitivity analyses for a range of disease progression rates .
sex and condom use we estimated condom use rate and frequency of ai based on three cohort studies among msm in beijing [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 47 ] and one meta - analysis among chinese msm [ 34 ] .
table 1 shows condom use rates for insertive and receptive ai ( and ) ranging from 30.7 % - 41.4 % [ 34 ] and the average frequency of ai with regular and casual sexual partners ( and ) ranging from 18.2 - 36.6 [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 47 ] .
transmission relative infectiousness of hiv - infected msm ( msm +) who receive hiv testing versus non - testing was defined as the ratio of high risk behavior of testing msm + to that of non - testing msm + .
the rationale is that hiv testing ( and counseling ) may lead to change of risky behaviors , such as reduction in sexual encounters or increasing condom use , or both .
based on risky behaviors among msm + from three cohort studies [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 42 ] , we calculated the relative infectiousness ratio ( ; 13.8 / 18.6 ) ( table 1 ) .
we assumed that non - testing msm did not have different risk behaviors by hiv status ( as they are unaware of their status ) and simulated the effect of risk reduction intervention to non - testing msm () .
the conservative estimate for the relative infectiousness among msm + who are on art versus non - art () was based on evidence that art can reduce hiv transmission by 60 % [ 48 ] .
the per - act risk of hiv transmission through unprotected receptive ai ranged from 0.008 - 0.028 , while the risk through insertive ai ranged from 0.0006 - 0.0019 [ 8 ] .
the estimated proportion of practicing receptive anal sex among msm ranged from 0.4 - 0.5 while the proportion of practicing insertive sex ranged from 0.5 - 0.6 [ 8 ] , and we estimated the proportion of insertive versus receptive sex acts as 0.56 ( table 1 ) .
intervention uptake the average testing rate for msm during 2001 - 2010 was estimated to be 9 % [ 49 ] .
the linkage rates for hiv - positive msm ranged from 17 % to 85 % with a mean rate of 33 % [ 49 ] .
the art initiation rates were estimated to be 1.8 % and 53 % among msm whose cd4 counts are >= 350 / microl and < 350 / microl , respectively [ 49 ] .
hypothetical scenarios we used the model to project hiv prevalence and incidence trends during 2011 - 2020 under five different scenarios : maintaining the coverage of interventions as they were ( i.e. , average coverage during 2000 - 2010 ) : art coverage ( and ) , condom use ( and ) , hiv testing () , and linkage to care () [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 47 ] , [ 49 ] .
increased art coverage only ( and ) .
increased tlc / art , but no increased condom use () .
increased condom use only ( and ) .
increased tlc / art () and condom use ( and ) .
in s4 - s5 , we assumed that condom use doubled since 2000 .
sensitivity analysis finally , we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the model results .
first , by perturbing individual parameters , we investigated their influence on estimates of . second , we estimated uncertainty ranges for model parameters based on literature reviews ( table 1 ) and randomly sampled 20,000 parameter sets over these uncertainty ranges using a latin hypercube sampling design [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] to derive a frequency distribution for r 0 .
analyses were performed using matlab computer software ( matlab 7.7 , the mathworks inc. , natick , ma , 2008 ) ; analysis scripts and supplemental materials are available online ( http :// biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu / archivedanalyses ) .
results using parameter values summarized in table 1 , our model produces a best - fit curve to historical hiv prevalence rates among msm in beijing during 2000 - 2010 ( figure 2a ) .
the basic reproduction number in 2010 is ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 1.83 - 2.35 ) .
because , if the epidemic assumptions remain unchanged from 2010 , the hiv prevalence is expected to substantially increase among msm in beijing .
using this best - fit model of hiv transmission during 2000 - 2010 , we project hiv prevalence for the next ten years ( until 2020 ) under five different scenarios .
the hiv prevalence is 7.8 % in 2010 .
if there is no change in the coverage of interventions or maintaining the average level during 2000 - 2010 ( figure 2 , line 1 ) , then the hiv prevalence is estimated to increase to 21.4 % ( 95 % ci , 9.9 - 31.7 %) ( figure 2a , line 1 ) , with an incidence rate of 3.1 % ( 95 % ci , 1.0 - 5.1 %) by 2020 ( figure 2b , line 1 ). by increasing the coverage of art among msm + who are linked to risk reduction ( figure 2 , line 2 ) , we expect a modest improvement in lowering hiv prevalence ( 19.9 % ; 95 % ci , 9.9 - 28.4 %) and incidence ( 2.6 % ; 95 % ci , 0.8 - 4.6 %) .
if tlc and art coverage increases ( figure 2 , line 3 ) , the projected hiv prevalence and incidence will be 14.5 % ( 95 % ci , 7.0 - 23.8 %) and 1.4 % ( 95 % ci , 0.2 - 3.3 %) .
if msm increase condom use only ( figure 2 , line 4 ) , then hiv prevalence and incidence will be 13.0 % ( 95 % ci , 9.8 - 28.4 %) and 1.5 % ( 95 % ci , 0.8 - 4.6 %) , respectively .
bundling increased tlc / art with increased condom use ( figure 2 , line 5 ) may result in an hiv prevalence of 8.7 % ( 95 % ci , 5.4 - 11.5 %) and an incidence of 0.5 % ( 95 % ci , 0.1 - 0.9 %) by 2020 .
it is important to note that only this bundled hiv intervention strategy is likely to have an and eventually result in hiv eradication in this population .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0090985.g002 figure 2 predicted effects on hiv prevalence and incidence among chinese msm in five scenarios of hiv combination interventions .
( a ) effect on hiv prevalence ; ( b ) effect on hiv incidence .
we performed simple sensitivity analyses for intervention and transmission parameters .
first , we analyzed the influence of the six intervention parameters ( testing and linkage to risk reduction ) on the prevalence during 2000 - 2020 ( table s1 ) .
the parameters related to hiv testing () have the greatest influence on the estimates of . in particular , the partial rank correlation coefficient ( prcc ) values range from - 0.98 to - 0.59 , indicating that decreases for higher testing rates .
similarly , the parameters related to hiv linkage to risk reduction ( l ) also impact . prcc ranged from - 0.44 to - 0.14 , indicating that decreases for a higher linkage rate .
figure 3 shows two contour plots of under different hiv testing or linkage to risk reduction among msm + while condom use remains at the average level during 2000 - 2010 .
even if all msm + are tested ( testing rate = 100 %) or are linked to risk reduction ( rr rate = 100 %) without increasing condom use , the reproduction number remains above the epidemic threshold () .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0090985.g003 figure 3 contour plots : the effects on under different coverage rates of hiv testing and risk reduction interventions among hiv - infected chinese msm while condom use remains at the average level of years 2000 - 2010 .
( a ) under the different coverage rates of hiv testing intervention ; ( b ) under the different coverage rates of hiv risk reduction ( rr ) intervention .
second , we analyzed the influence of the relative infectiousness of msm + on art versus non - art ( varying 0.01 - 0.4 ) and that of msm + with cd4 counts < 350 / microl versus >= 350 / microl ( varying 0.5 - 5.0 ) .
in all perturbations for relative infectiousness , endures .
third , we found that is sustained if msm increase condom use but the coverage of tlc interventions remains at the average level during 2000 - 2010 .
fourth , we varied the average duration of disease progression without art from 3.7 - 11.1 years and with art from 7.4 - 22.2 years .
the median is 2.11 and consistently greater than 1 .
in extensive sensitivity analyses , 20,000 parameter sets were randomly sampled from corresponding uncertainty ranges ( table s2 ) .
the distribution of is skewed to the right with mean 1.93 ( standard deviation : 0.82 ) and median 1.82 ( interquartile range : 1.36 - 2.42 ) .
a small percentage ( 11.4 %) of estimates falls below the epidemic threshold () .
relative infectiousness of rr to non - testing msm + , transmission probability of unprotected receptive ai , and relative infectiousness of msm + on art to non - art are the three most influential parameters with prcc equaling to 0.95 , 0.90 and 0.71 , respectively .
discussion combination testing and treatment intervention packages have been considered as a promising strategy for hiv prevention among msm in recent years [ 52 ] .
we explored the effects of tlc / art , along with condom use , for the emerging hiv epidemic among chinese msm [ 4 ] , [ 53 ] .
our projections predicted that with the current level of services hiv prevalence among msm in beijing will almost triple from 7.8 % in 2010 to 21.4 % by 2020 .
expansion of art coverage in the current continuum of care among msm + would only lead to a moderate reduction of this rising trend , though enhanced tlc interventions plus increased art coverage will further reduce incident hiv infections .
only with a combination of increased condom use and a higher tlc / art coverage might hiv epidemic be expected to decline .
hence , promoting safer sex education and risk reduction counseling service to increase condom use is crucial for hiv prevention among chinese msm , even in the context of expanded tlc and art .
as observational studies and the hptn 052 randomized controlled trial have demonstrated the effectiveness of art for reducing heterosexual hiv transmission [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] , [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] , [ 58 ] , treatment as prevention has been advocated as a strategy for hiv prevention among msm [ 59 ] .
however , the impact may vary by epidemic scenarios [ 21 ] .
in settings with a long - standing epidemic like san francisco , tlc with art expansion may reduce the hiv epidemic [ 52 ] .
our model is less optimistic that art interventions alone will succeed in substantial prevention reduction .
the hiv epidemic among chinese msm is relatively recent [ 44 ] , and the majority of cases may still be in earlier stages of disease , and therefore have not received art [ 13 ] .
we use local public health data such as art coverage rates for estimating the parameters in the mathematical models ; therefore our modeling results likely reflect what is actually happening in beijing .
a comparable example is that in the hptn 052 trial earlier art treatment reduced heterosexual transmission by 96 % [ 7 ] , while among 38,862 chinese serodiscordant couples the rate of transmission was only reduced by 26 % in the first year of treatment and the reduction lost statistical significance in subsequent years [ 60 ] .
the former result comes from a controlled trial setting while the later one is from a real - world public health setting .
our model projections are consistent with the study in the united kingdom where increased condom use was more likely to drive down hiv incidence than high art coverage [ 20 ] .
increasing coverage of hiv testing may lead msm + in beijing to reduce risky behaviors , notably the use of condoms ; partner reduction interventions and serosorting ( i.e. , msm of the same hiv status ) interventions could conceivably have a similar benefit , but we did not model these factors .
based on our model , hiv prevalence will continue to increase , as fewer msm + die and fall out of transmission networks .
the impact of hiv testing is largely dependent on how those infected msm with known status reduce their risk behaviors , particularly practicing anal sex without condom use .
given that only a fraction of hiv - infected men know their status , are eligible for art , and successfully negotiate the system to adhere to art , increased condom use is a crucial element in the combined interventions for reducing the epidemic .
the limitation of our mathematical model is a simplification of the real world epidemic .
like other models , we balance parsimony and reality .
for example , we assumed that all linked msm + receive risk reduction .
this is consistent with chinese hiv testing protocol that all msm + are expected to receive risk reduction counseling .
however , in reality , the quality of counseling may vary by clinic and client .
because some counseling may not lead to behavioral changes , we considered condom use as an independent factor in our model .
although model parameters are carefully specified using the available literature , they may not reflect the current realities among beijing msm .
for example for scenario 3 , we assumed increasing hiv testing from 9 % to 25 % ; increasing the linkage rate to risk reduction education from 19 % to 50 % among hiv - uninfected msm and from 33 % to 75 % among hiv - infected msm ; increasing art coverage from 1.8 % to 25 % among hiv - infected msm whose cd4 + cell count >= 350 / microl and from 53 % to 75 % among those with cd4 count < 350 / microl .
the magnitude of these assumed increases in coverage are based on our best estimations of how well the public health system could do , in the view of local hiv / aids experts ( including authors yr , xh , hl and ys as well as non - author experts from local centers for disease control ) .
however , we performed extensive sensitivity analyses by varying input parameters and found that our findings are robust to reasonable perturbations .
no scenario can result in a substantial decline in hiv epidemic by 2020 among chinese msm , except the bundled package of transmission prevention strategies including increased tlc / art and condom use .
simulations show that tlc alone has some impact for hiv reduction , but far less than increasing condom use .
our model suggests that increasing condom use must be a component of combination intervention packages to achieve significant reduction in hiv incidence .

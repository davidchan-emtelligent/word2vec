recent studies demonstrate that transformation of mild lupus nephritis into end - stage disease is imposed by silencing of renal dnasei gene expression in ( nzbxnzw ) f1 mice .
down - regulation of dnasei results in reduced chromatin fragmentation , and in deposition of extracellular chromatin - igg complexes in glomerular basement membranes in individuals that produce igg anti - chromatin antibodies .
the main focus of the present study is to describe the biological consequences of renal dnasei shut - down and reduced chromatin fragmentation with a particular focus on whether exposed large chromatin fragments activate toll like receptors and the necrosis - related clec4e receptor in murine and human lupus nephritis .
furthermore , analyses where performed to determine if matrix metalloproteases are up - regulated as a consequence of chromatin - mediated toll like receptors / clec4e stimulation .
mouse and human mrna expression levels of dnasei , toll like receptors 7 - 9 , clec4e , pro - inflammatory cytokines and mmp2 / mmp9 were determined and compared with in situ protein expression profiles and clinical data .
we demonstrate that exposure of chromatin significantly up - regulate toll like receptors and clec4e in mice , and also but less pronounced in patients with lupus nephritis treated with immunosuppresants .
in conclusion , silencing of renal dnasei gene expression initiates a cascade of inflammatory signals leading to progression of both murine and human lupus nephritis .
principal component analyses biplot of data from murine and human lupus nephrits demonstrate the importance of dnasei gene shut down for progression of the organ disease .
introduction lupus nephritis is a serious manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) and a major predictor of poor outcome [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
the predominance of chromatin - associated autoantigens involved in lupus nephritis points at deficiencies in the processing and clearance of chromatin from dead cells as central factors in the pathogenesis of sle [ 3 ] - [ 8 ] .
enzymatic dna fragmentation by different endonucleases is significant during apoptotic cell death ( reviewed in [ 9 ] , [ 10 ]) , and in the elimination of chromatin released from necrotic cells ( reviewed in [ 9 ] - [ 11 ]) .
in renal tissue , dnasei represents the major endonuclease [ 12 ] .
a reduced fragmentation of chromatin during development of nephritis in ( nzbxnzw ) f1 ( bw ) mice was shown to coincide with an acquired loss of renal dnasei mrna and enzyme activity [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] .
this appears when mild mesangial lupus nephritis transforms into end - stage organ disease [ 5 ] .
without adequate degradation by dnasei , chromatin may transform into secondary necrotic chromatin released from apoptotic blebs [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
in this situation , chromatin fragments may exert central roles in the pathogenesis of sle .
chromatin may activate the innate immune system through interaction with toll - like receptors ( tlr ) 7 - 9 and the nucleosome - specific adaptive immune system [ 16 ] - [ 19 ] .
next , exposed chromatin may act as in situ target structures for the induced anti - dsdna antibodies ( reviewed in [ 3 ]) .
the chromatin - mediated stimulation of tlr may also up - regulate certain matrix metalloproteases ( mmps ) [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
for example , engagement of tlrs can up - regulate pro - inflammatory cytokines ( tnfalpha , ifngamma ) [ 22 ] , and interleukins [ 23 ] - [ 26 ] by either mapk , erk kinase or rel through nfkb gene activation [ 22 ] , [ 25 ] - [ 28 ] .
such cytokines can directly up - regulate mmps [ 22 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
alternatively , incomplete clearance and degradation of apoptotic cells may transform them into secondary necrotic cell debris [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 30 ] - [ 32 ] .
necrotic cell debris contains sap130 , which serves as a ligand for the inflammation - related receptor clec4e [ 33 ] .
downstream signalling induced by sap130 - clec4e interaction also promotes production of pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] and up - regulation of mmps .
thus , the mechanisms that lead to inflammation in lupus nephritis may therefore involve tlr [ 16 ] , [ 36 ] and the clec4e receptor [ 37 ] .
therefore , it is relevant to include the clec4e receptor in the present study , since we hypothesized that loss of renal dnasei would result in necrotic transformation of apoptotic cells , with a consequent release of large chromatin fragments and sap130 [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
several studies suggest that tlr signalling is important in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [ 28 ] , [ 39 ] - [ 42 ] , while the role of clec4e in this context is undetermined .
secreted mmps have the potential to disintegrate glomerular basement membranes ( gbm ) and the mesangial matrix by enzymatic degradation [ 43 ] .
this biological event may facilitate deposition of chromatin fragment - igg complexes .
mmp2 / mmp9 activities are reported to be increased within glomeruli of nephritic , but not pre - nephritic bw mice [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 44 ] .
reduced expression of renal dnasei and increased expression of renal mmps via the tlr system make a reasonable explanation as to how large chromatin fragments are generated within the kidneys , and how they reach access to membranes and matrices .
as a result , we demonstrate that tlr7 - 9 as well as the clec4e receptor and downstream signalling molecules are up - regulated in untreated lupus prone mice , and most importantly , while less pronounced , also in human lupus nephritis isn / rps class iv , even though these patients were under treatment .
these events promote up - regulation of renal mmp2 and mmp9 , with their detrimental effects on glomerular matrices and membranes [ 28 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ]. from the present data , we conclude that reduced renal chromatin metabolism imposed by dnasei gene silencing is a key factor to understand how necrotic chromatin - mediated activation of tlr and clec4e result in a consequent up - regulation of pro - inflammatory cytokines , and increased expression of mmp2 and mmp9 .
these processes will in the end result in deposition of large chromatin fragments in complex with igg in gbm , and in fulminant lupus nephritis [ 5 ] .

results tlr7 - 9 and clec4e and down - stream signalling are activated during progression of murine lupus nephritis baseline data for the bw mice included in this study has been published recently [ 5 ] .
these mice are grouped according to morphology of the kidneys and presence or absence of serum anti - dsdna antibodies : group 1 mice have no deposits of immune complexes in the kidneys ; group 2 mice have chromatin - igg complex deposits , seen as electron dense structures ( eds , as described in both murine and human lupus nephritis [ 6 ] , [ 47 ]) in the mesangium ; group 3 mice have eds in the mesangium and within the gbm .
this separation into 3 groups is in accordance with the analyses published recently [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] ( see figure 1a ) .
mice from each group ( n = 3 ) were further analysed by a tlr signalling qpcr array assay on genes linked to the tlr and the clec4e signalling .
we observed that genes which are up - regulated at any stage of murine lupus nephritis could be systematically divided into the following subgroups ( table 1 ) : i. receptors ( the tlr7 - 9 and clec4e ) ; ii. signalling molecules ( myd88 , muc13 , ly86 , nfkb , and rel ) ; iii .
co - stimulatory molecules ( cd80 / cd86 ) ; and iv. cytokines and interleukins ( tnfalpha , ifngamma. il - 6 , il - 10 ) .
those who are significantly up - regulated are marked by asterisks .
the complete tlr signalling results are presented in table s1 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0034080.g001 figure 1 renal expression of dnasei , tlr and clec4e in ( nzbxnzw ) f1 mice grouped according to glomerular location of eds .
the mice were sorted into 3 main groups according to kidney morphology ( a ) ; pre - nephritic mice ( group 1 , no eds ( n = 6 ) ; mice with mesangial eds deposits ( group 2 ( n = 12 )) , or mice with eds in gbm ( group 3 ( n = 5 )) .
magnification x40 k. in b , mrna expression levels for renal dnasei , tlr7 - 9 and for the clec4e receptor with corresponding expression of proteins in kidneys of group 1 - 3 mice are demonstrated .
dnasei gene expression levels correlate inversely with tlr7 - 9 and clec4e receptor expression levels , both with respect to transcription and translation of the genes in group 3 of bw mice .
for statistics , see table 2 .
inserts in the dnasei immunofluorescence panels represent western blots of the dnasei .
an unpaired t - test was performed (* : p < 0,05 ; *** : p < 0,0001 ) .
dnasei gene shut - down correlates with activation of tlr7 - 9 and clec4e to further explore dnasei , tlr and clec4e gene expression in a larger group of bw mice , individual , selected genes were analysed by qpcr for group 1 ( n = 6 ) , group 2 ( n = 12 ) , and in group 3 ( n = 5 ) bw mice .
in figure 1b , mean values (+/ - sd ) for dnasei , tlr7 - 9 and clec4e mrna in each mouse group are presented , and significant differences are indicated by asterisks .
the data demonstrate that dnasei gene expression was nearby completely silenced in group 3 mice , while tlr7 - 9 and clec4e mrna levels increased significantly during disease progression .
in agreement with the qpcr results , renal expression of the dnasei protein in group 3 mice was undetectable by immunofluorescence and western blot assays compared to staining intensity in group1 and group 2 mice ( figure 1b , western blot results are inserted in panels in group 1 - 3 kidneys ) .
furthermore , in situ expression of the tlr7 - 9 and the clec4e ( figure 1b ) proteins correlated well with the respective qpcr levels ( figure 1b ) .
since clec4e regulation in lupus nephritis is not determined previously , we also analysed if this receptor was selectively up - regulated in nephritic kidneys or in other organs expressing this protein , like the spleen .
although clec4e gene expression increased immensely in kidneys during progression of the disease from mesangial ( group 2 ) to membrano - proliferative nephritis ( group 3 , figure 1b ) , clec4e expression levels in spleens remained stable at baseline levels throughout the disease process ( data not shown ). by micro - dissection , and mrna analyses of renal cortex and medulla , dnasei was silenced in both compartments of the kidneys from group 3 bw mice , thus demonstrating that dnasei gene silencing is not linked to certain renal structures ( data not shown ) , similar to the dnasei staining pattern observed by immunofluorescence analyses of the same kidneys ( figure 1b ) , showing a uniform loss of the dnasei protein .
silencing of renal dnasei correlates with exposure of chromatin , while exposure of chromatin correlates with tlr7 - 9 and clec4e activation deposits of large chromatin fragment - igg complexes in gbm was observed solely in kidneys of mice from group 3 with the lowest renal dnasei gene expression levels ( r = - 0,39 , p < 0,05 , figure 2a ) , and low dnasei gene expression also correlated inversely with severe proteinuria ( r = - 0,42 , p < 0,05 , figure 2b ) .
renal expression of mmps is thought to be instrumental in promoting large chromatin - igg complex deposits in gbm [ 5 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 48 ] .
since mmps may be imposed by tlr activation [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] , we hypothesized that loss of dnasei is not directly correlated with tlr / clec4e gene activation , but rather indirectly through reduced fragmentation and a consequent in situ exposure of secondary necrotic chromatin fragments ( for tlrs ) and sap130 ( for clec4e , [ 33 ] , [ 51 ] 10.1371 / journal.pone.0034080.g002 figure 2 silencing of renal dnasei correlates with chromatin deposition in gbm and severe proteinuria , while exposure of chromatin correlates significantly with activation of tlr7 - 9 and clec4e .
reduced expression of renal dnasei correlates inversely with chromatin - igg deposits in gbm ( a ) and with severe proteinuria ( b ) .
tlr7 - 9 activation is not significantly correlated with silenced renal dnasei ( c ) , while a consequence of reduced dnasei enzyme activity , i.e. exposure of chromatin in e.g. gbm demonstrate a strong and highly significant correlation with tlr7 - 9 activation ( d ) .
). similarly , the clec4e receptor activation is not significantly correlated with silenced renal dnasei ( e ) , while exposure of secondary necrotic chromatin demonstrate a strong and highly significant positive correlation with clec4e activation ( f ) .
in harmony with this assumption , we demonstrate that silencing of the renal dnasei gene expression did not directly correlate with up - regulation of tlr7 - 9 gene expression ( for correlations and significances , see figure 2c and table 2 ) .
however , renal exposure of large undigested chromatin fragments correlated strongly and significantly with increased tlr7 - 9 gene expression ( figure 2d , and table 2 ) .
results of analyses of the clec4e receptor activation strengthen this observation .
as loss of dnasei did not correlate significantly with activation of clec4e ( figure 2e , table 2 ) , renal exposure of chromatin fragments correlated highly significantly with increased expression of clec4e ( figure 2f , table 2 ) .
expression of mmp2 and mmp9 during progressive lupus tlr activation can directly , or indirectly by increased expression of tnfalpha and infgamma , up - regulate mmp2 and mmp9 [ 22 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
both tnfalpha and infgamma were found to be up - regulated in the murine kidneys during progression of lupus nephritis when analyzing all mice in all groups ( data not shown ) , as previously demonstrated by others [ 52 ] - [ 56 ] .
thus , the results demonstrated in figures 1 and 2 , therefore , may link tlr and clec4e stimulation with up - regulation of mmp2 and mmp9 , and in cell culture experiments we observed that tnfalpha and infgamma up - regulated mmp9 and mmp2 , respectively , in rptec ( data not shown ) .
data in figure 3 demonstrate an insignificant increase in renal mmp2 , but not in mmp9 mrna levels ( figure 3a ) , and a corresponding increase in mmp2 protein ( western blot , figure 3b ) or in activated mmp2 ( zymography , figure 3c ) in group 3 kidneys .
on the other hand , serum concentrations of mmp2 and mmp9 were stable in all stages of the disease as demonstrated by quantitative elisa for mmp2 and mmp9 ( figure 3d ) .
in agreement with the hypothesis that mmp2 gene expression is linked to activation of tlrs , e.g. tlr8 correlates significantly with expression of mmp2 ( r = 0,63 , p < 0,001 , figure 3e ) .

similar to results obtained in group 3 bw mice , we observed a profound silencing of dnasei gene expression in kidneys with membrano - proliferative lupus nephritis ( isn / rps class iv , figure 4a ) compared with dnasei mrna levels in control kidneys .
very low dnasei mrna levels were observed in 3 of the 4 , while patients ln4 presented normal dnasei mrna level although having class iv nephritis .
however , this patient had been on treatment continuously the last 11 years ( table 3 ) , which may have modified the disease process .
western blot analyses of renal proteins demonstrated a single band corresponding to the mw of human dnasei ( figure 4b ) .
low band intensities were solely found in the kidney samples that demonstrated considerably reduced dnasei mrna levels ( ln 1 - 3 , figure 4a and 4b ) .
similarly , immunohistochemistry analyses of kidney sections demonstrated strong staining intensity of the dnasei protein in normal control kidneys ( figure 4c ) and in isn / rps class ii kidneys ( figure 4c ) .
in isn / rps class iv kidneys , dnasei staining of ln 1 - 3 was barely detectable ( figure 4c ) , in agreement with the low dnasei mrna levels in these patients .
proteins from kidneys of ln4 were not available for this analysis .
control analyses in other renal diseases ( like diabetic nephrosclerosis or membrano - proliferative glomerulonephritis type 2 ) demonstrated dnasei staining intensity similar to that in normal kidneys , and kidneys with isn / rps class ii lupus nephritis ( figure 4c ) .
taken together , shut - down of the renal dnasei gene expression seems to be an event linked to progression of both murine and human lupus nephritis , as has been indicated in a previous pilot study [ 13 ] .
thus , dnasei shut down in progressive lupus nephritis is not a general phenomenon linked to e.g. renal inflammation .

low band intensities were solely found in the kidney samples that demonstrated considerably reduced dnasei mrna levels ( ln 1 - 3 , a and b ) .
similarly , immunohistochemistry analyses of kidney sections demonstrated strong staining intensity of the dnasei protein in normal control kidneys ( c ) and in isn / rps class ii kidneys ( c ) .
in isn / rps class iv kidneys , dnasei staining was barely detectable ( c ) , in agreement with the low dnasei mrna levels in these patients .
control analyses in other renal diseases ( like diabetic nephrosclerosis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type 2 ) demonstrated dnasei staining intensity similar to that in normal kidneys , and kidneys with isn / rps class ii lupus nephritis ( c ) .
the qpcr analyses revealed that tlr7 and tlr 8 were up - regulated in class iv nephritis , although without reaching statistical significance ( d ) .
the tlr 9 and clec4e ( data not shown ) mrna levels did not differ at all from the control group .
in harmony with this , immunohistochemical staining of kidneys with class iv lupus nephritis revealed increased staining intensity of tlr8 ( e ) .
an unpaired t - test is performed (* p < 0,05 ) .
the qpcr analyses revealed that tlr7 and tlr 8 were up - regulated in class iv nephritis , although without reaching statistical significance ( figure 4d ) .
the tlr 9 and clec4e mrna levels did not differ at all from the control group ( data not shown ) .
in harmony with this , immunohistochemical staining of kidneys with class iv lupus nephritis revealed increased staining intensity of tlr8 ( see figure 4e for details on each tlr ) .
the discrepancy of tlr expression between murine and human nephritis may be due the fact that these patients had been treated with immunosuppressive drugs while mice were not .
the ln6 , having mesangial lupus nephritis isn / rps class ii , had normal levels of dnasei , tlr7 - 9 and clec4e mrna levels ( data not shown ) , similar to bw mice with mesangial nephritis .
expression patterns of mmp2 and mmp9 in kidneys from patients with human isn / rps class iv lupus nephritis as demonstrated in figure 5a , the mmp2 and mmp9 mrna levels were significantly up - regulated in class iv lupus nephritis .
the high mmp2 and mmp9 mrna levels were also reflected by increased protein levels as demonstrated by western blots ( figure 5b ) and by immunohistochemistry ( figure 5c ) , thus demonstrating that these proteins are strongly expressed in class iv kidneys .

overall statistical and pca biplot analyses of the data obtained in this study table 2 shows a square matrix where the upper diagonal part demonstrates spearman correlation coefficients .
the lower diagonal part presents the corresponding p - values for all murine data included in this study .
in figure 6 , the result of a principal component analysis ( pca ) biplot drawn with the r biplot function is demonstrated .
the pca biplot is aimed to optimally display variances and not correlations .
the angles between the various biplot axes are good indicators of the correlations among the variables ( shown as arrows ) .
in a , the murine , and in b the human biplot on ln 1 - 3 , and in c the human biplot for ln 1 - 4 are presented .
in b and c the biplot varies since in b all data are from the 3 kidneys with low dnasei , while in c , the vectors is shown to differ due to the fact that one patient ( ln4 ) had normal renal dnasei .
the result of the murine pca biplot ( figure 6a ) demonstrate that the mice confine perfectly into three groups , one pre - nephritic ( group 1 , all mice labelled with 1 ) , one with mild mesangial nephritis ( group 2 , mice labelled with 2 ) , and one with end - stage membrano - proliferative nephritis ( group 3 , mice labelled with 3 ) .
this result confirms that the parameters used to group bw mice as in figure 1a are biologically relevant .
in sum , the data demonstrate a highly significant inverted correlation between proteinuria / eds in gbm and dnasei gene expression , while eds in gbm was significantly associated with activation of tlr7 - 9 and clec4e ( table 2 ) .

pca biplots aim to optimally display variances and not correlations .
the angles between the various biplot axes serve as good indicators of the correlations among the variables ( shown as arrows ) .
similarly , the position of the samples of individual mice ( shown as the signs 1 , 2 and 3 for group 1 - 3 mice ) relative to the arrows , provide good indications as to which variable ( s ) have had the largest effect on disease progression .
the result of the biplots demonstrates that groups emerging from this analysis perfectly correlated with the groups of bw mice as defined in figure 1 , defined as pre - nephritic bw mice ( group 1 ) , bw mice with deposits of eds in the mesangial matrix ( group 2 ) or with deposits in the gbm ( group 3 ) .
in b , a similar biplot has been generated for the human data , where the 3 patients with low dnasei expression levels are included .
in c , all 4 patients with lupus nephritis class iv are included , i.e. also the patient with normal renal dnasei .
as is demonstrated , the vector for dnasei differs in b and c , thus demonstrating the impact of dnasei levels on the biplot .
for all biplots , the most striking observations are that dnasei vector points away from the diseased individuals ( to the left in the biplots ) , while mmp2 , mmp9 , tlrs and eds associated with gbm are clustered and points at the most severely diseased murine and human individuals , in harmony with the statistical analyses demonstrated in table 2 .
similarly , the position of individual human controls ( ctr1 - 3 ) and patients ( ln1 - 3 ( b )) or ( ln1 - 4 ( c )) relative to the vectors provides good indications as to which variable ( s ) have had the largest effect in each individual patient .
as is evident in data presented in figure 6 , the dnasei vector points towards normal murine ( group1 ) and human ( ctr 1 - 3 ) individuals due to its inverse impact on disease progression .
the data presented in table 2 and in figure 6a - c are relevant to explain biological events imposed by the dnasei shut - down and its role for progression of lupus nephritis .
in sum , the vector that point at chromatin - igg deposits in gbm are clustered with vectors pointing at tlr7 - 9 , clec4e , mmp2 and mmp9 , indicating an interdependency between them , while the dnasei vector points the opposite direction due to its negative correlation with advanced lupus nephritis .
discussion at a certain time point in the life of bw mice , the renal dnasei mrna and enzyme activity is inevitably lost .
acquired silencing of renal dnasei gene expression appears to have an immense pathogenic impact on progressive lupus nephritis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 58 ] .
the clinical consequence of renal dnasei gene silencing is an inevitable transformation of mild mesangial lupus nephritis into end - stage organ disease .
in this respect , two questions are regarded important to answer ; i. why the renal dnasei gene is silenced ( studies in progress ) ; and ii. if loss of dnasei activity is the event that imposes increased mmp activity through interaction of un - fragmented secondary necrotic chromatin with tlrs and the clec4e receptor ( present study ) .
however , exposure of chromatin may not by itself be sufficient to impose clinical lupus nephritis .
for example , similar in situ exposure and retention of large un - fragmented chromatin fragments have been described in several experimental nuclease deficiencies on non - autoimmune backgrounds ( see e.g. [ 9 ] , [ 59 ] - [ 61 ]) .
the clinical consequence of chromatin fragments in these experimental nuclease deficiencies differ from that in kidneys of individuals with lupus nephritis , simply because in the latter , antibodies to chromatin are present .
thus , antibodies to dsdna may be the factors that render exposed chromatin pathogenic .
in this study we analysed the pathophysiological effect of renal exposure of chromatin fragments .
the basic hypothesis was that exposure of chromatin may be the factor that indirectly up - regulate expression of mmps .
this up - regulation may be induced by at least 3 different pathways : i. directly through interaction of chromatin with tlr [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 49 ] ; ii. indirectly through tlr - mediated up - regulation of tnfalpha and ifngamma , both having the capacity to induce increased expression of mmp2 / mmp9 enzyme activity [ 23 ] - [ 25 ] ; or iii .
indirectly through downstream signalling induced by interaction between debris released from apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells [ 30 ] , [ 62 ] and the clec4e receptor , and a consequent up - regulation of proinflammatory cytokines [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
the three pathways indicated above are all operational in up - regulation of mmp2 , and to a lesser extent mmp9 , and may actually be co - operative in lupus nephritis .
thus , it may be true that mmps represent the factor that disintegrate membranes in progressive lupus nephritis and thereby provide access in situ for large chromatin fragments that have escaped dnasei - mediated fragmentation .
a more detailed pathophysiological picture of lupus nephritis appears from data described here , and previously [ 5 ] .
the process resulting in fulminant lupus nephritis may be summarized as follows .
appearance of anti - dsdna antibodies , followed by formation of small chromatin fragment - igg complexes and their deposition in the mesangial matrix represent the factors that induce mild or silent mesangial nephritis [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] .
the inflammatory milieu created by the early mesangial nephritis process may , although it deceptively appears as a clinically non - significant disorder , be the factors that silence the dnasei gene expression .
this model may be valid both for focal nephritis , and for global end - stage nephritis , depending on whether dnasei is silenced globally in the kidney or only in smaller inflammation affected renal foci .
the latter is currently under investigation in our laboratory .
thus , data presented here may point at early , clinically silent or mild mesangial nephritis as an inducer of dnasei silencing .
this indicates a wider effect on the genomic region and further epigenetic analyses are needed to explain this latter phenomenon .
contemporary studies are consequently focused to identify the epigenetical mechanisms that account for silencing of the dnasei gene .
we are currently analysing two mechanisms ; i. the role of regulatory rnas , and have yet identified at least one microrna in murine lupus nephritis that theoretically target dnasei mrna ; and ii. transcriptional interference with closely situated genes. of importance is also to identify the timely relationship between inducers of dnasei gene silencing , and if the silencing is the direct cause for progression of lupus nephritis from mild mesangial nephritis into end - stage organ disease .
this process may be relevant to understand the basis for focal as well as global lupus nephritis .
in renal regions where dnasei activity is low , un - fragmented chromatin may be retained and bound to membranes and targeted by relevant potentially nephritogenic anti - chromatin autoantibodies .
thus , focal lupus nephritis ( see [ 63 ] for classification of lupus nephritis ) may reflect focal glomerular exposure of chromatin fragments that have escaped degradation in regions with silenced dnasei gene .
if silencing of dnasei appears globally in the kidneys of a given patient , this will promote a uniform end - stage disease .
to understand how the dnasei gene is down - regulated in the kidney may bring us a significant step towards the understanding of the molecular and genetical events that in the end result in progressive lupus nephritis .
this insight may also be important to develop new and causal treatment strategies , like inhibiting dnasei gene silencing , or to inhibit binding of chromatin to membranes along strategies recently published [ 64 ] .

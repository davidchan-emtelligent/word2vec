there are not enough studies that describe the isokinetic strength of professional soccer players at high angular velocities .
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the seasonal changes in isokinetic strength of turkish professional soccer players ( n = 14 ) over the course of a 24 - week soccer season .
the isokinetic strength of players who underwent usual soccer training and weekly competition throughout the soccer season was assessed by means of the biodex system 3 dynamometer with the knee attachment .
the peak torque of knee extensor and flexor muscles were measured at angular velocities of 60degrees / s , 300degrees / s and 500degrees / s. players were tested at the beginning and end of the competitive season .
while the first - and second - test measurements did not show significant changes at 60degrees / s and 300degrees / s angular velocities , at the end of the training period , players' knee strength changed significantly at 500degrees / s angular velocities .
in addition , the h / q ratio improved significantly for the dominant as well as non - dominant leg at 500degrees / s. significant bilateral strength improvements for knee flexors were also observed at 500degrees / s. the findings of this study suggest that usual daily soccer training ( technical , tactical , power , strength , endurance , flexibility , etc. ) and weekly competition might produce changes in knee strength at high angular velocities .
isokinetic strength h / q ratio bilateral strength soccer seasonal changes introduction soccer competitions demand activities such as kicking , jumping , heading , sprinting , turning , changing pace and tackling where players use explosive strength ( reilly and thomas , 1976 ) .
in addition , the intensity of soccer competitions requires forceful contractions to keep balance and control of the ball against defensive pressure .
all these activities need certain levels of strength and power from players in specific playing positions ( taskin , 2008 ) .
in fact , when observing soccer players during competitions who perform strength related activities , it may be noticed that they apply strength in varying high speeds ( o'donoghue , 2001 ) .
the strength of hamstring and quadriceps muscles are vital for soccer players for locomotion in the game .
previous research has consistently reported that concentric and eccentric strength of hamstring and quadriceps muscles may positively affect sprint and jumping performances of soccer players ( mark et al. , 2004 ) .
prior studies have also revealed that apart from skill , kicking performance in soccer was an important result of knee extension and flexion strength , as well as lower limb velocity ( de proft et al. , 1988 ; reilly and drust , 1997 ) .
in addition , player injuries might result from the lack of strength of hamstring and quadriceps muscles and / or bilateral hamstring strength deficits combined with higher physical demans of competition and more aggressive play ( jonhagen et al. , 1994 ) .
therefore , attempts to train weak hamstring and quadriceps muscles to improve strength and achieve strength balance between them appear to be an important objective for coaches .
in fact , players who are exposed to strength training can improve their muscular strength .
for example , several researchers have found that technical and tactical training , games , conditioning and all other activities , combined with strength training , were shown to affect the strength levels of soccer players ( de proft et al. , 1988 ; islegen and akgun , 1988 ; oberg et al. , 1985 ; reilly and thomas , 1977 ) .
as a result of such a training program , strength gains among soccer players can be observed .
for example , it was reported that regular players when compared to substitutes , and professional players when compared to amateurs , have superior isokinetic muscle strength at various angular velocities ( cometti et al. , 2001 ; wisloff et al. , 1998 ) .
there are various studies in which researchers examined the pre - season physiological and physical changes of soccer players over a period of 6 - 8 weeks .
most of this research focused on endurance , power , and anthropometric measurements ( bangsbo , 1994 ; brady et al. , 1997 ; brewer , 1990 ; casajus , 2001 ; de proft et al. , 1988 ) and limited research reported isokinetic strength changes at slower velocities in soccer players ( reilly and thomas , 1977 ) .
however , no research examined the isokinetic strength changes at higher angular velocities in elite soccer players over a competitive season .
various environmental stimuli during soccer training and competition might result in certain long - term physiological adaptations to improve players' endurance and speed , as well as strength .
the biggest argument for including high - velocity exercise in a player 's resistance - training program deals with the concept of specificity ( murray , 2006 ) .
soccer players apply high - speed movement for sprint performance during a match .
training with high - speed movement in strength exercises enables high - speed adaptation .
consequently , soccer players should practice their exercises at high speed .
also , high - velocity exercises may have an appropriate place in a periodized resistance - training program designed for players who require speed ( kawamori and newton , 2006 ) .
therefore , the aim of this study was to evaluate the seasonal changes in isokinetic strength of knee muscles at various angular velocities in turkish elite soccer players over the course of a 24 - week soccer season that included regular daily practice and one or two regular matches per week .
the authors attempted to answer the question how elite soccer players adapted to the effects of conditioning , practice , and high level competition over an entire season by assessing their strengths at two different time points .
material and methods subjects fourteen soccer players , 18 - 32 years of age , all members of a professional soccer team in the turkish soccer super league , participated in the study .
before conducting the experiment , all subjects were informed on the risks of the study and gave informed consent , and it was a part of their professional contract .
the study was approved by the ethics committee of the celal bayar university and met the conditions of the helsinki declaration .
all soccer players participated in the 24 - week soccer - specific training and competitions as regular and / or substitute players .
players with a long history of injuries were eliminated from the study .
the basic physical characteristics of the players are summarized in table 1 .
procedures participants in this study were assessed at two different times throughout the 24 - week soccer season .
the first measurement of isokinetic strength was taken in the first week of soccer training ( the first week of july ) .
the second measurement was completed in the last week of the season ( the last week of december ) .
the biodex system 3 ( biodex medical systems inc. , new york , usa ) dynamometer was used to measure the isokinetic knee strength .
before testing , the participants were informed about the machine 's specific details and they warmed up for 15 minutes .
participants sat in an upright position on the adjustable dynamometer chair and the shoulders , pelvis and thighs of each subject were secured by straps to minimize extraneous body movements .
before testing each participant , the knee joint was positioned at 90 ( o ) of flexion ( full extension defined as 0 ( o )) and the visual alignment of the dynamometer lever arm and the distal point of the lateral femoral condyle were completed .
the movements were corrected by taking the effects of gravity into consideration .
participants held their arms in a comfortable position during testing .
the measurement of peak isokinetic concentric knee extension and knee flexion torque in both legs were taken at 3 angular velocities of movement , low at 60degrees / s , intermediate at 300degrees / s , and high at 500degrees / s. the range of the knee extension and flexion contractions were performed at 0 - 90 ( o ) .
testing progressed from slowest to highest speeds .
participants were given three opportunities to warm up at submaximal concentric contractions and then performed the maximal concentric contractions four times .
they rested for 40 seconds before each angular velocity test .
the rest period between each lower limb testing lasted 3 minutes .
each participant was verbally encouraged during the test .
variables such as peak torque ( nm ) , knee flexor / knee extensor ratio ( hamstring / quadriceps ratio ( h / q ratio )) , bilateral leg strength differences as a percent of extensor ( bde ) and flexor ( bdf ) were also calculated for further analysis .
bilateral leg strength differences were calculated by applying the biodex system .
the h / q ratio was calculated by using the absolute values of each muscle as percentages .
the highest peak torque was used to calculate the bilateral leg strength differences and h / q ratio .
soccer - specific training content the specific soccer training took 24 weeks to be completed , including 7 weeks of pre - season training and 17 weeks of in - season training during the second half of the soccer season .
table 2 and 3 summarize the season - long soccer - specific training content and general activity content of weekly training .
in general , as shown in tables 2 and 3 , typical soccer training included both general soccer training activities ( technical and tactical training , games and matches ) and conditioning ( speed , agility , coordination , stretching , endurance and power development ) during the pre - season as well as in season .
the duration of practice sessions was 90 - 100 min when there was one training per day , while it was 60 - 70 min when there were two training sessions per day .
statistical analysis the mean +/ - standard deviation values were reported for all the variables used .
a paired samples t - test was used to compare the differences between the first and second measures in this study .
the level of significance was set at p < 0.05 .
results in terms of the physical characteristics of the participants ( table 1 ) , no significant changes were observed for body mass between the first and second test measures for seasonal changes in peak isokinetic knee strength values of extensor and flexor muscles .
the first and second test values of the peak isokinetic strength , at 60degrees / s and 300degrees / s for knee extension and knee flexion , remained unchanged .
however , the peak isokinetic leg strengths at 500degrees / s for knee extension and knee flexion significantly increased ( p < 0.01 ) from the first to second evaluations ( tables 4 and 5 ) .
seasonal h / q ratio changes the comparisons of both dominant ( d ) and non - dominant ( nd ) legs hamstring to quadriceps ratio ( h / q ratio ) mean values at 60degrees / s and 300degrees / s during the soccer season showed no significant changes ( table 6 ) .
however , an interesting finding was that a significant increase in the h / q ratio at an angular velocity of 500degrees / s for both the d and nd legs ( p < 0.01 ) and of 300degrees / s for the d leg ( p < 0.05 ) were observed during the soccer season ( table 5 ) .
the h / q ratio changed from 63.53 +/ - 18.23 % to 98.14 +/ - 19.84 % ( p < 0.01 ) for the dominant leg and increased from 72.97 +/ - 15.59 % to 96.36 +/ - 19.15 % ( p < 0.01 ) for the non - dominant leg at the 500degrees / s measurement level .
seasonal bilateral strength differences no significant differences were observed at 60degrees / s and 300degrees / s for knee extension and knee flexion when comparing the average bilateral strength difference .
however , the average bilateral strength differences at 500degrees / s for knee extension and knee flexion decreased ( p < 0.01 ) ( table 7 ) .
an examination of table 6 at 500degrees / s angular velocities for pre - and post - season measurements illustrates that bilateral strength differences for knee extensors changed insignificantly from 14.86 +/ - 7.58 % to 11.37 +/ - 9.09 % .
on the other hand , knee flexor bilateral strength differences changed significantly from 20.73 +/ - 12.71 % to 7.70 +/ - 6.83 % ( p < 0.01 ) .
reported bilateral strength differences for knee extensor and flexor were also not significant at 60degrees / s as well as at 300degrees / s angular velocities .
discussion the main finding of this study is that isokinetic strength performance increased at the end of the soccer season , as was shown by significant increases in isokinetic strength values at high angular velocities .
observation of the soccer game shows that all important activities in soccer seem to be performed at high velocities .
in fact , soccer players perform sprints every 90 seconds that can last 2 - 4 seconds and comprise up to 11 % of the distance covered during a match ( reilly and thomas , 1976 ; o'donoghue , 2001 ) .
knee movement reaches 600 - 700degrees / s ( sale , 1990 ) during high intensity efforts , such as sprinting .
soccer players also perform approximately 50 quick and forceful turns to maintain balance and control the ball under defensive pressure .
therefore , coaches probably consider the high velocity nature of soccer when constructing training programs to improve explosive strength of players .
indeed , velocity - specific training during strength training studies suggests that the training velocity should mimic athletic performance ( prevost et al. , 1999 ) .
the effects of soccer - specific training on isokinetic strength at low angular velocities have previously been reported .
however , no data exists that investigates isokinetic strength at high angular velocities over the course of a competitive season .
seasonal changes in peak isokinetic knee strength values for extensor and flexor muscles the results of this study indicated that soccer - specific training activities and competitions did not change the peak knee isokinetic strength of the players at lower angular velocities .
however , peak knee isokinetic strength changes in extensor and flexor muscles were reported at a 500degrees / s angular velocity ( tables 5 and 6 ) , which was close to the velocities performed during training .
limited research shows that pre - season strength training might produce back and leg strength development ( islegen and akgun , 1988 ) .
in addition , some researchers reported the effects of 6 weeks pre - season strength training to increase knee and hip eccentric and concentric strength values at 3.65 rad.s - 1 angular velocities as a result of strength training twice a week ( 1rm 80 %) in addition to the normal soccer training throughout the season .
players in the strength training group showed an increase of 25 % and 77 % in eccentric and concentric strength while the control group players had an increase of 2 % and 10 % in their strength values ( de proft et al. , 1988 ) .
hoff and helgerud ( 2004 ) also reported that a combination of soccer training and strength training ( 3 times a week , 85 % of 1rm ) led to a 52 % increase in power development for soccer players without using the isokinetic dynamometer in strength measurements ( hoff and helgerud , 2004 ) .
additionally , in the hoff and helgerud study ( 2004 ) , the results of the players' squat improved from 116 to 176 kg and their vertical jumping height increased from 57.2 to 60.2 cm ( hoff and helgerud , 2004 ) .
although there are reports that pre - season and in - season strength training combined with specialized soccer training might increase the strength of lower extremities in players , there are also studies with controversial findings .
for example , reilly and thomas ( 1977 ) reported that 6 weeks of pre - season training did not contribute to strength improvement ( reilly and thomas , 1977 ) .
although our study differs from the studies mentioned above in terms of methods , the way the strength was measured ( isokinetically ) and measurement velocities ( 60degrees / s , 300degrees / s and 500degrees / s ) , strength changes were observed as a result of the daily regular soccer training program and weekly competitions .
our results also suggest that soccer - specific training and competitions might be important for producing knee isokinetic strength changes at high angular velocity ( at 500degrees / s ) .
nevertheless , velocity specificity of resistance training is controversial , and training with high velocity movements increases high - velocity strength relatively more than low - velocity strength , and vice versa ( kanehisa and miyashita , 1983 ; narici et al. , 1989 ; sale , 1992 ) .
in contrast , other studies have shown that high - velocity training also produces significant increases at low angular velocities ( dudley and djamil , 1985 ) .
in fact , velocity specificity of resistance training has demonstrated that the greatest strength gains occur at or near the training velocity ( behm and sale , 1993 ) .
seasonal h / q ratio changes maximal isokinetic hamstring muscle strength relative to the maximal isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength ratio ( h / q ratio ) is used regularly to describe the muscle strength properties for the knee joint ( kannus , 1994 ) .
as this study points out , specific soccer training results in h / q ratio changes in the dominant as well as non dominant leg at 500degrees / s angular velocities ( table 6 ) .
reported differences were not significant at 60degrees / s as well as at 300degrees / s angular velocities , except for 300degrees / s in the dominant leg .
as the results indicate , the h / q ratio changes were close to the strength training velocity of each player .
previous studies claimed that leg flexion and leg extension strength levels should be equal to one another and the hamstring muscle group is the weak link in sprinting , therefore , it needs to be strengthened ( dintiman and ward , 1988 ) .
in addition , a low h / q torque ratio is one of the factors that might contribute to injuries ( jonhagen et al. , 1994 ) .
as our study shows , a soccer - specific training program and competitions produce a change in h / q torque ratio at higher angular velocities .
strengthening the hamstring / quadriceps muscle group to achieve a 1:1 torque ratio could be important for muscular stability at the knee joint during fast knee extension ( aagaard et al. , 1995 ) .
metaxas et al .
( 2009 ) found that quadriceps and hamstring peak torques at various angular velocities of 60 , 180 , and 300degrees / s were 270.4 +/ - 31.4 ( nm ) , 178.9 +/ - 21.1 ( nm ) , 128.6 +/ - 14.5 ( nm ) for quadriceps and 155.2 +/ - 13.9 ( nm ) , 104.2 +/ - 13.2 ( nm ) , 77.2 +/ - 14.7 ( nm ) for preparatory period in 100 soccer male players from the greek national leagues .
seasonal bilateral strength changes in this study , the results show that soccer - specific training and weekly competitions were effective in reducing the imbalance between the dominant and non - dominant legs , especially at 500degrees / s angular velocities .
this could be beneficial to soccer players in improving their performance and , most importantly , reducing the risk of injury in their lower limbs .
as indicated , differences in strength profiles between the two legs have been considered as an important predictor of injury in soccer players ( leatt et al. , 1987 ) .
in fact , a bilateral imbalance of hamstring and quadriceps muscle strength between the dominant and non - dominant legs has been found to be at the level of 10 % in soccer players ( hamzeh and head , 2004 ) .
a muscle strength imbalance of more than 10 % might increase the risk of injury ( kramer and balsor , 1990 ) .
in our study , as shown in table 7 , while bilateral strength differences for the knee extensor was 11.37 +/ - 9.09 % , knee flexor bilateral strength differences were less than 10 % ( 7.70 +/ - 6.83 %) at 500degrees / s for post - season measurement .
possible reasons for isokinetic knee strength changes in summary , in the present study , there was a statistically significant change in peak knee isokinetic strength levels and h / q ratios only for flexors at 500degrees / s angular velocities ( especially for knee flexors ) .
on the other hand , bilateral strength differences decreased significantly .
the reasons for finding changes at high angular velocities include ( 1 ) performing all strength training at higher velocities at least once per week , ( 2 ) performing extra strength training for hamstrings ( which was the weak knee flexor muscle group ) to achieve a higher h / q ratio , ( 3 ) performing leg curls for hamstrings , and leg extensions for quadriceps by choosing weight intensities close to 1 / 1 to improve the h / q strength ratio , and ( 4 ) performing high speed strength training ( power training ) , sprint , agility , coordination , and plyometric exercises throughout the season , twice a week .
another potential explanation for the high change might be that players had very low pre - season strength levels .
previous studies claimed that explosive strength changes might be the result of learning ( rutherford and jones , 1996 ) , improved coordination ( sale , 1992 ) , and a reduction in antagonist co - contraction ( wisloff et al. , 1998 ) .
in addition , poulson et al .
( 1999 ) reported that a drop in a co - activation level , which occurred close to the mean angular velocity of training , may partly explain the arm flexion strength gains .
changes in high angular velocity strength production during the 24 - week soccer - specific training and weekly competitions might result primarily from significant increases in the neural adaptation of the trained muscles .
previous research findings supported the idea of the neural adaptation of muscles as a result of a specific training regimen .
for example , behm and sale ( 1993 ) claimed that high velocity training adaptations might involve significant neural adaptations ( behm and sale , 1993 ) .
in addition , hakkinen et al .
( 1985 ) showed significant improvements in strength and power with light - load explosive resistance training ( hakkinen et al. , 1985 ) .
such developments were supported by observation of electromyography increases in muscle electrical activities primarily at the velocity of training .
specifically , it appears that the velocity of the movement , as controlled by the load , plays a key role in improving high - velocity performance capabilities and possible neural mechanisms of adaptation ( hakkinen et al. , 1985 ) .
prevost et al .
( 1999 ) also reported short - term improvements in isokinetic torque at high velocities following training that involved fast isokinetic contractions , which may occur due to neural facilitation .
however , the reader should be aware of the arguments that neural adaptations may be limited to the initial stage of strength training ( 6 - 8 weeks ) ( sale , 1992 ) or such adaptations may continue during the later stages of strength training ( hoff et al. , 2001 ) .
in conclusion , our data suggests that the 24 - week planned program of soccer - specific conditioning and weekly competitions may help soccer players to have significant strength gains at high angular velocities of 500degrees / s. however , at lower angular velocities ( 60degrees / s and 300degrees / s ) , there were either no or very limited strength gains for knee extensor and flexor muscles .
specifically , at a 500degrees / s angular velocity , while the peak isokinetic leg strength for knee extension and flexion and h / q ratio for dominant and non - dominant legs were improving , bilateral strength differences were decreasing .
thus , the changes showed that daily soccer - specific training and weekly competitions might increase strength at high angular velocities .
the authors would like to thank all the dedicated soccer players and coaches for their participation .
also , we would like to express our gratitude to shannon rose mavi and halil taskin for their contributions .

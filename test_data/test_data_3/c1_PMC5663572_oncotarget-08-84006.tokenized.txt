basal cell carcinoma ( bcc ) is one of the most diagnosed cancers worldwide .
it develops due to an unrestrained sonic hedgehog ( shh ) signaling activity in basal cells of the skin .
certain subtypes of bcc are more aggressive than others , although the molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unknown .
we have previously reported that neogenin - 1 ( neo1 ) is a downstream target gene of the shh / gli pathway in neural tissue .
given that shh participates in epidermal homeostasis , here we analyzed the epidermal expression of neo1 in order to identify whether it plays a role in adult epidermis or bcc .
we describe the mrna and protein expression profile of neo1 and its ligands ( netrin - 1 and rgma ) in human and mouse control epidermis and in a broad range of human bccs .
we identify in human bcc a significant positive correlation in the levels of neo1 receptor , ntn - 1 and rgma ligands with respect to gli1 , the main target gene of the canonical shh pathway .
moreover , we show via cyclopamine inhibition of the shh / gli pathway of ex vivo cultures that neo1 likely functions as a downstream target of shh / gli signaling in the skin .
we also show how neo1 expression decreases throughout bcc progression in the k14 - cre : ptch1lox / lox mouse model and that aggressive subtypes of human bcc exhibit lower levels of neo1 than non - aggressive bcc samples .
taken together , these data suggest that neo1 is a shh / gli target in epidermis .
we propose that neo1 may be important in tumor onset and is then down - regulated in advanced bcc or aggressive subtypes .
bcc neogenin - 1 shh / gli pathway netrin - 1 tumor aggressiveness introduction according to the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc , who ) basal cell carcinoma of the skin ( bcc ) is one of the most common neoplasms worldwide , with a 10 % increase in incidence every year .
uv radiation is one of the main risk factors for the acquisition of bcc , therefore it develops most frequently in areas of the skin that are most exposed to the sun and its incidence increases with age [ 1 , 2 ] .
clinically , bcc is a collection of slow growing , telangiectatic nodules with epidermal basal cell resemblance .
however , there is a lot of histo - morphological variability among bccs which exhibits distinct gene expression patterns [ 3 ] .
incomplete excision , frequent occurrence , increased risk of subclinical spread and aggressive local behavior are characteristics of high - risk aggressive bcc , consisting of micronodular , infiltrative and sclerosing bcc subtypes .
in contrast , nodular bcc ( comprising 60 - 80 % of bccs ) and superficial bcc ( comprising 10 % of bccs ) exhibit a slow growing and non - invasive growth pattern , these tumors form cellular nodules that do not infiltrate the dermis and are therefore easier to resect [ 4 - 6 ] .
in the large majority of cases , bcc has been found to develop due to constitutive activation of the sonic hedgehog / gli ( shh / gli ) pathway .
typically , shh binds to its receptor , patched1 ( ptch1 ) , which results in loss of smoothened ( smo ) repression .
smo is subsequently phosphorylated which results in the accumulation of transcriptional gli activators that drive the expression of hedgehog target genes such as ptch1 , gli1 , and bcl2 , among others [ 7 , 8 ] .
in the skin , shh / gli signaling regulates hair follicle growth and morphogenesis , allowing the initiation of anagen ( growth ) phase , where the expression of shh and the ability of cells to respond to this signaling is temporally and spatially regulated during the hair follicle cycle [ 9 , 10 ] .
in human bcc , constitutive activity of the shh / gli pathway is most commonly attributed to inactivating mutations in ptch1 , resulting in unrestricted smo activity [ 11 , 12 ] .
moreover , heterozygous deletion of ptch1 occurs in gorlin syndrome , a disorder that predisposes patients to a wide range of tumours , including development of bcc [ 13 - 15 ] .
although the majority of bccs have been shown to exhibit increased shh / gli pathway activity , each subtype exhibits a unique gene expression profile [ 3 ] .
to date , it remains unclear as to whether aggressive tumor growth is attributable to events downstream of shh / gli pathway activation or to other yet unidentified pathways .
neogenin - 1 ( neo1 ) is a receptor that was recently reported as a transcriptional target of the shh / gli pathway in the central nervous system [ 16 ] .
neo1 has two main ligands , netrin - 1 ( ntn1 ) and rgma , which are chemotactic molecules for axonal guidance during neural development [ 17 ] .
neo1 has also been proposed to be a death dependence receptor ( ddr ) [ 18 , 19 ] .
in presence of their ligands , ddrs promote positive signaling , such as cell proliferation , migration and survival , and in absence of their ligands , they can lead to apoptosis , therefore they are proposed to be involved in tumorigenic processes [ 20 ] .
neo1 has been reported to be deregulated in several cancer types but little is known about its specific function in cancer cells .
in many of these cases , the deregulation of neo1 is associated with elevated tumor aggressiveness and progression [ 21 - 25 ] .
in the present study , we show that neo1 is expressed in both human and mouse skin and that its expression decreases as murine bccs develop in the k14cre : ptch1lox / lox mouse model [ 26 ] .
while non - aggressive human bcc subtypes display high neo1 expression , aggressive human bcc subtypes present with lower levels of neo1 , similar to gli1 , suggesting a possible role of shh / gli / neo1 signaling in tumor aggressiveness .
results neo1 is expressed in the proliferative basal cell compartment of the skin although neo1 is detected in human skin , as indicated by genome - wide transcriptomics and proteomics [ 27 ] , to date a detailed study on its expression pattern is not available .
therefore , we first decided to examine the expression of neo1 in control ( not cancerous ) human skin via immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) staining in order to describe its histological distribution and to correlate its expression levels with shh / gli pathway activity .
human epidermis is a polystratified epithelium composed of several layers of flattened ( squamous ) epithelial cells , acting as a tight water - proof barrier ( figure 1a ) .
we observed neo1 protein expression was restricted to the stratum basale ( s.b ) or basal layer , directly adjacent to the dermis ( figure 1b ) , which is where epidermal progenitors reside .
this is the same epidermal compartment in which ptch1 expression is observed ( figure 1c ) .
hence neo1 is expressed in the same cell population responsive to shh / gli signaling , these data are consistent with neo1 being a downstream target of that pathway .
we subsequently set out to address whether neo1 ligands were expressed in control epidermis and observed the two main neo1 ligands , ntn1 and rgma , were expressed in the basal layer ( figure 1d and 1e ) .
expression of neo1 ligands in the same cell population as neo1 itself is consistent with neo1 acting as a dependence receptor .
figure 1 neo1 is expressed in human epidermal basal cells ( a ) h & e of human skin showing stratum corneum ( s.c ) , granulosum ( s.g. ) squamous ( s.s. ) , and basale ( s.b ) of epidermis ( scale bar = 250 mum ) .

negative controls are shown as insets .
we next assessed neo1 expression in mouse skin , which has an identical stratified structure as human skin , albeit thinner ( figure 2a ) .
indistinguishable from human skin , murine neo1 protein is restricted to the proliferative ( figure 2b ) epidermal basal layer ( figure 2c and supplementary figure 1 ) .
the level of shh / gli pathway activity is variable during postnatal epidermis , namely attributable to changes in the hair follicle cycle .
pathway activity is higher during periods of hair follicle growth ( anagen ) and lower during the phases of hair follicle regression and rest ( catagen and telogen respectively ) [ 9 ] .
as expected , we observed highest levels of gli1 mrna ( used as a read - out of shh / gli pathway activity ) at time points that correlate with stages of hf growth ( p13 and p29 ) ( figure 2d ) .
not only did the level of neo1 mrna follow the same cyclical trend as gli1 , moreover , the level of neo1 was similar to the level of gli1 at all three ages analyzed .
in contrast , the expression level of neo1 ligand mrna was much lower ( ntn1 is almost undetectable , rgma is about 10 - fold lower ) ; they also fail to cycle along hf stages ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
analogous to neo1 being a neuronal target of shh / gli pathway activity , these data support neo1 as a potential downstream target of shh / gli1 pathway activity in the skin .

neo1 expression in bcc we next set out to address whether neo1 was expressed in bcc .
bcc is often characterized as a hyperproliferative mass of basal cells .
we confirmed that our cohort of sporadic and gorlin - related bcc was indeed highly proliferative ( ki67 immunoreactivity ) ( figure 3a ) .
in order to determine the spatial distribution of neo1 within the neoplasm , we screened both sporadic and gorlin - related bccs by ihc .
in sporadic bcc , we observed that neo1 was uniformly expressed throughout the tumor lesions .
consistent with its cellular distribution in control epidermal basal cells , we observed nuclear neo1 expression within the bulk of the tumor ( figure 3b asterisk ) .
in the palisading basal cells , were high gli1 expression has been described before [ 12 ] , the staining for neo1 was stronger and diffused within the cytoplasm ( figure 3b arrow ) .
even though , neo1 staining was stronger in the palisading cells of gorlin - related bcc , similar to the staining in sporadic bcc , the overall staining of neo1 was more diffused in the bulk of the tumor ( figure 3b asterisk ) with a more cytoplasmic distribution .
comparison of ihcs of control skin ( figure 1b ) and bcc ( figure 3b ) reveal that neo1 is highly expressed in tumor sections compared to control skin .
to corroborate the latter , we evaluated neo1 protein abundance through western blotting ( wb ) in whole bcc tumor tissue extracts and compared it with whole skin extracts from adjacent region ( figure 3c ) .
we confirmed that there is a higher neo1 expression in bcc compared to its surrounding healthy skin ( figure 3d ) .
in addition , we assessed the protein abundance of neo1 and ligands in a small cohort of sporadic human bcc tumor samples by wb. we detected varying levels of neo1 among the samples .
interestingly , ntn1 was detected in all the samples analyzed , while rgma was detectable in only 3 of them ( supplementary figure 3 ). of note , we also observed neo1 expression in eccrine sweat glands and sebaceous glands ( supplementary figure 4 ) .

we expanded our analysis of neo1 expression by performing quantitative analysis of neo1 mrna levels in both human control skin and in a variety of sporadic bcc tumor samples ( figure 4a ) .
we also quantified the mrna levels of gli1 , and neo1 ligands ntn1 and rgma .
control skin samples were obtained from non - related surgeries and there was no variation for any of the genes assessed according to excision site ( supplementary figure 5a ) or donor gender ( supplementary figure 5b ) .
both neo1 and gli1 mrna levels varied greatly among bcc samples ( figure 4a ) .
in order to determine if there was a significant correlation between the level of neo1 transcript expression and the amplitude of shh / gli signaling pathway activity ( using gli1 as a readout of pathway activation ) we calculated the correlation spearman r value between both genes .
this analysis revealed that there was indeed a significant and positive correlation between neo1 and gli1 expression levels ( i.e. as the level of gli1 increases the level of neo1 never decreases ) ( figure 4a ) .
neo1 ligand transcript levels also varied greatly among bcc samples ( figure 4b ) .
both ntn1 and rgma were found to exhibit a significant positive correlation with gli1 ( figure 4b ) .
figure 4 positive correlation between neo1 signaling and shh / gli pathway activation ( a - b ) mrna levels of neo1 , gli1 , ntn1 and rgma were quantified by qpcr in sporadic human bcc samples .

for each ligand , spearman r and p values were calculated and are shown in the table , ** p < 0.01 ; *** p <= 0.001 .
( c ) five human bcc samples were cultured as explants and treated with 10 mum cyclopamine or vehicle control ( etoh 0.1 %) for 48 h. cyclopamine treatment decreases the expression of downstream targets such as gli1 , ptch1 , bcl2 and also neo1. of neo1 ligands only ntn1 expression was diminished after inhibitor treatment .
levels of unc5b , another reported ntn1 receptor with no - known relationship to the shh / gli pathway is shown as control .
data are represented as mean +/ - sem with * p < 0.05 according to mann - whitney test .
in order to address whether the correlation between neo1 / ntn1 / rgma and gli1 is directly attributable to these genes acting as downstream targets of shh / gli pathway activity , we performed ex vivo inhibition of human bcc explants .
consistent with effective pathway inhibition , we observed a decrease in ptch1 , gli1 , and bcl2 mrna levels ( known shh / gli pathway target genes ) upon treatment with the smo antagonist , cyclopamine .
in contrast to the mrna level of rgma or unc5b ( an unrelated ntn1 receptor ) , which did not change upon cyclopamine treatment , neo1 and ntn1 displayed significant decreases in mrna upon treatment ( figure 4c ) .
these data demonstrate that transcriptional activation of both the neo1 receptor and ntn1 ligand are modulated by shh / gli pathway activity .
neo1 expression and bcc progression we next set out to address whether neo1 levels remained static or varied during the course of bcc initiation and progression .
in order to evaluate this , we made use of our previously published k14 - cre : ptch1lox / lox mouse model [ 26 ] , whereby ablation of ptch1 in mouse epidermal cells results in the rapid development of bcc - like lesions ( figure 5b ) .
mrna levels of neo1 and gli1 were quantified in skin samples obtained from control and k14 - cre : ptch1lox / loxmice on p13 , p20 , and p29 .
in line with the results obtained from our human bcc analyses ( figure 4a ) , the level of neo1 and gli1 mrna in k14 - cre : ptch1lox / lox skin presented with a significant positive correlation ( figure 5c ) .
consistent with gli1 being upregulated in murine bcc , we observed high levels of gli1 mrna in k14 - cre : ptch1lox / lox epidermis in all three bcc developmental stages assessed .
in contrast , neo1 levels were significantly lower than control epidermis at all stages of bcc development ( figure 5d ) .
moreover , the level of neo1 decreased as bcc development progressed ( lower levels at p29 than at p13 ) ( figure 5d ) .
immunofluorescence staining of neo1 in control mouse skin revealed intense nuclear staining in the proliferative ( pcna positive ) basal cell layer ( figure 5e ) .
in contrast , neo1 appeared dim and cytoplasmic within proliferative and non - proliferative regions of k14 - cre : ptch1lox / lox bcc ( figure 5e ) .
these data suggest that in contrast to human bcc samples , whereby we observed high levels of neo1 in mrna and protein in a subset of bcc samples , murine bcc development is linked to a loss of neo1 expression .

association of neo1 levels of expression with bcc aggressiveness we performed a pca analysis on the mrna data of human bcc samples that included values of neo1 , its ligands , and the shh / gli pathway components , in order to assess the variation among the human sporadic bcc samples .
this analysis revealed that most of the variance in the human bcc samples ( 87 %) is due to the first component , and that almost all of the loading of this component was due to neo1 ( supplementary figure 6 ). with the assistance of anatomopathologists , all human sporadic bcc samples were classified according to their aggressive or non - aggressive histomorphological phenotype .
we compared the expression levels of neo1 in these samples , and found that neo1 mrna levels were significantly lower in aggressive human bcc samples than in non - aggressive samples ( figure 6a ) .
in addition to this , due to the correlation between neo1 and gli1 expression and to the high variability of gli1 levels among human bcc samples ( figure 4a ) , we performed the same analysis on gli1 mrna levels and found that they were also significantly lower in aggressive human bcc subtypes compared to non - aggressive subtype samples ( figure 6b ) .
we corroborate this at a protein level by evaluating neo1 abundance in a cohort of aggressive and non - aggressive sporadic bcc samples ( figure 6c ) .
we found significant lower amounts of neo1 in aggressive samples compared to non - aggressive ones ( figure 6d ) .
finally , we performed if to verify neo1 protein distribution in aggressive and non - aggressive human bcc samples .
neo1 presented with a strong cytoplasmic and nuclear expression profile in non - aggressive tumor tissues ( figure 6d ) , similar to the staining of neo1 in basal cells of control mouse skin .
in contrast , aggressive human bcc samples presented with dim and diffuse neo1 expression , resembling the expression profile of mouse bcc samples ( compare figures 6d and 5e ) .
these data reveal that lower levels of neo1 mrna and neo1 protein correlate with aggressive bcc subtypes .
figure 6 low levels of neo1 are related with bcc aggressiveness ( a - e ) subtypes of sporadic human bcc samples were assessed by histomorphological analysis .
mrna levels of both neo1 ( a ) and gli1 ( b ) of aggressive bcc subtypes ( n = 10 ) are significantly lower than levels of non - aggressive bcc ( n = 22 ) .
data is represented as mean +/ - sem with * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ; according to mann - whitney test .

discussion neo1 is expressed in epidermal basal cells the shh / gli signaling pathway participates in the growth phase of the hair follicle cycle [ 9 , 10 ] .
constitutive pathway activation has been linked to a wide variety of cancers , particularly bcc [ 11 - 13 , 28 - 30 ] .
the consequences of shh / gli pathway activation mostly relate to cell proliferation and control of the cell cycle [ 31 ] .
in this study we assessed whether the ddr neo1 , which has been shown to be a transcriptional target gene of the shh / gli pathway [ 16 ] , was expressed in the epidermis and if its expression correlated to the bcc aggressiveness behavior and progression .
here we found that neo1 is indeed expressed in the adult epidermis and that its expression is restricted to cells of the basal layer ( figure 1b ) , where shh / gli pathway components are also expressed [ 9 ]. of note , a possible functional interaction between neo1 and ptch1 , a classical shh / gli read - out gene , has been recently suggested [ 32 ] .
the variations of neo1 mrna levels in mouse skin , followed the same pattern as shh / gli pathway , assessed by the quantification of gli1 mrna ( figure 2d ) .
if neo1 levels vary along the length of the hair follicle remains to be determined .
neo1 has many functions ; it has been described to participate in neurogenesis during development acting both in proliferation and as a axonal guidance receptor and in adulthood by controlling migration and proliferation of neuroblast [ 17 , 23 , 33 - 36 ] .
however , it is also implicated in the development and homeostasis of non - neural tissue such as that of the mammary gland , via its role in cell - cell adhesion [ 37 ] . here , we present the expression of neo1 basal cells of epidermis , but the mechanism and function of neo1 in this context remains unknown .
our results lead us to propose a possible participation for neo1 in skin homeostasis , in relation to the activity of the shh - gli pathway .
it has been recently described that neo1 participates in adherens junction formation and maintenance , which are fundamental for skin barrier function and control of basal cell polarity and therefore asymmetric cell division for stratification [ 38 , 39 ] .
neo1 might be acting as an adhesive molecule in epidermal basal cells and therefore could be able to regulate both the proliferation and stemness of the cells [ 39 , 40 ] .
nonetheless more research needs to be done in order to determine the precise function of neo1 in skin formation and the hair follicle cycle .
neo1 is expressed in bcc but is downregulated in aggressive bcc subtypes and tumor progression importantly , neo1 is also expressed in varying levels in bccs .
how the shh / gli pathway activation ultimately leads to a bcc phenotype is still relatively poorly understood .
previous work by other groups have shown variations in gli1 mrna levels in bcc .
although they do not refer to this observation directly in the text , the data / figures indicate up to 100 - fold variation [ 41 - 44 ] .
in this study , we observe the same variation of gli1 levels ( figure 4a and 4b ) and show that this variability could be correlated with the aggressiveness of the bcc tumor , where lower gli1 expression levels correspond to more aggressive bcc subtypes ( figure 6b ) .
it has been reported that p53 is a negative regulator shh / gli1 pathway by inhibiting gli1 activity [ 45 ] .
p53 has mutations in almost 50 % of sporadic bccs where its downregulation increases shh / gli pathway activity leading to excessive proliferation and bcc development [ 46 , 47 ] .
interestingly , higher p53 expression has been found in aggressive bcc subtypes , supporting our results that show low levels of gli1 in aggressive bcc [ 46 , 48 ] .
thus , p53 could be acting as a negative regulator of gli1 .
hence , we postulate that gli1 activity may change during tumor progression and this could be related to acquisition of new mutations that regulate gli1 activity .
if this is the case , then it is possible that the shh / gli pathway may be essential for tumor onset and maintenance , but not for tumor invasion and aggressiveness .
neo1 appears to be downregulated in murine ptch1 mutant bcc and additionally , older k14 - cre : ptch1lox / lox mice with advanced bcc have lower neo1 expression ( figure 5d and 5e ) .
we also show that neo1 expression is significantly reduced in aggressive human bcc subtypes when compared to non - aggressive samples ( figure 6 ) .
this may be indicative that neo1 is a negative marker for tumor aggressiveness and we would expect a decrease in its expression along tumor progression .
since neo1 is related to cell - cell adhesion , its downregulation could promote epithelial - mesenchymal transition in the aggressive subtypes of bcc and explain the histology of this neoplasms where tumor cells form desegregated islands compared to big nodules of non - aggressive subtypes [ 4 , 38 , 49 ] .
while neo1 is significantly lower in aggressive bcc subtypes , we also detected low levels in specific non - aggressive bcc tumor samples .
here , the discretion lies in the fact that the samples used in this work are from a group of patients of varying ages , sunscreen use habits , and tumor stage and that research analysis was conducted in a single - blinded fashion .
therefore , the low neo1 expression of the specific non - aggressive bcc samples may be as a result of patient - specific variables or due to the tumor 's transition from a non - aggressive to an aggressive tumor .
as neo1 is expressed in both human and mouse normal basal cells , the decrease of neo1 in bcc could be also explained by a loss of basal identity .
nonetheless , further analysis of neo1 variations in bcc subtypes is necessary in order to explain different tumor behaviors .
neo1 is not the only transcriptional target of shh / gli pathway that is downregulated in bcc .
research shows that bcl - 2 ; a well - characterized transcriptional target of the shh / gli pathway [ 50 ] is also downregulated in aggressive bcc subtypes [ 51 , 52 ] .
hence , although shh / gli signaling has been well characterized to play a pivotal role in driving bcc initiation , there is also evidence that further support our findings that shh / gli signaling activity is indeed down - regulated in aggressive subtypes and advanced stages of bcc .
here we show that the shh / gli pathway modulates not only neo1 , but also some of its ligands ( figure 4b and 4c ) .
taken together , the results reveal that shh / gli pathway activation or inactivation may be affecting the overall neo1 signaling .
the shh / gli pathway is in cross talk with several other signaling pathways .
besides shh / gli wnt , notch , and transforming growth factor beta ( tgf - beta )/ bone morphogenetic protein ( bmp ) signaling are key among the pathways controlling epidermal lineage and homeostasis [ 53 - 55 ] and many other cancer related pathways are expressed distinctively among bcc subtypes [ 3 ] .
neo1 has recently been shown to function as a co - receptor for the bmp proteins that belong to the tgf - beta superfamily , and rgms signal via neo1 and bmps and physically connects both pathways [ 56 ] .
neo1 was also found to bind directly with bmp - 2 , bmp - 4 , bmp - 6 , and bmp - 7 and to regulate negatively the functions of bmp [ 57 ] .
noteworthy , neo1 may thus represent a critical node linking shh / gli and bmp signaling in bcc .
it might therefore be important to simultaneously evaluate the respective contribution of both pathways on neo1 function .
future research should take this into consideration and determine whether or not other pathways are involved in bcc aggressiveness and progression .

background rhesus macaque ( macaca mulatta ) is the most widely used nonhuman primate animal in biomedical research .
a global map of genetic variations in rhesus macaque is valuable for both evolutionary and functional studies .
results using next - generation sequencing technology , we sequenced a chinese rhesus macaque genome with 11.56 - fold coverage .
in total , 96 % of the reference indian macaque genome was covered by at least one read , and we identified 2.56 million homozygous and 2.94 million heterozygous snps .
we also detected a total of 125,150 structural variations , of which 123,610 were deletions with a median length of 184 bp ( ranging from 25 bp to 10 kb ) ; 63 % of these deletions were located in intergenic regions and 35 % in intronic regions .
we further annotated 5,187 and 962 nonsynonymous snps to the macaque orthologs of human disease and drug - target genes , respectively .
finally , we set up a genome - wide genetic variation database with the use of gbrowse .
conclusions genome sequencing and construction of a global sequence variation map in chinese rhesus macaque with the concomitant database provide applicable resources for evolutionary and biomedical research .
background rhesus macaque ( macaca mulatta ) and human shared a most recent common ancestor about 25 million years ago [ 1 ] and their genome sequences share 93.5 % identity [ 2 ] .
due to the genetic and physiologic similarity between rhesus macaque and human , rhesus macaques are the most widely used nonhuman primate animals for biomedical research , for example , in vaccine development and as animal models for human diseases [ 3 - 7 ] .
in research , rhesus macaque subspecies from india and china are the most commonly used , and the divergence between these was estimated to be about 162,000 years ago [ 8 ] .
the observed genetic divergence , though shallow , is considered to underlie the observed phenotypic differences between them , such as with regard to immune responses and disease progression .
the well - known example is that , compared with indian rhesus macaques , simian immunodeficiency virus ( siv ) pathogenesis in chinese rhesus macaques is closer to hiv - 1 infections in untreated adult humans [ 9,10 ] .
although previous studies have determined thousands of snps and hundreds of microsatellite polymorphisms [ 8,11 - 16 ] , a genome - wide high - density genetic variation map of rhesus macaque could provide much more comprehensive information .
therefore , developing a global map of genetic variations within and between indian - and chinese - derived rhesus macaques has important implications for biomedical research and drug development .
here we sequenced the genome of a male chinese macaque and compared the data with the released reference genome of an indian macaque ( rhemac2 ) [ 2 ] .
we identified a total of 2.94 million snps that are heterozygous in the chinese macaque and 2.56 million snps that are different between the chinese macaque and the reference indian macaque genomes .
we also observed 123,610 deletions and other structural variations ( svs ) by comparing chinese with indian macaques .
we constructed a database , the chinese macaque single nucleotide polymorphism ( cmsnp ) database , to display the snps and svs using the generic genome browser ( gbrowse ) platform .
we have also integrated other valuable annotated information to enrich the cmsnp database , resulting in a comprehensive compilation of rhesus macaque genetic variations .
results and discussion data generation a peripheral blood sample was collected from a healthy male chinese rhesus macaque ; this was used for dna extraction using the standard phenol / chloroform method .
we performed whole - genome sequencing of this macaque genomic dna sample using the illumina genome analyser , with span sizes of the three paired - end dna libraries ranging from 44 to 200 bp. in total , 33 gigabases of high quality sequences with 706.5 million reads ( read lengths of 44 and 49 bp ) were generated .
using the improved short oligonucleotide alignment program ( soap2 ) [ 17 ] , we mapped the reads to the reference indian macaque genome .
a summary of the resequencing data is shown in table 1 and in table s1 in additional file 1 .
in general , 92.64 % of the reads can be mapped to a unique position in the reference genome and 95.95 % of the bases in the reference genome are covered , resulting in an average 11.56 - fold coverage .
the relatively lower genome coverage in macaque resequencing compared with the more than 99 % genome coverage in human resequencing [ 18,19 ] is likely due to the relatively low sequencing coverage of our study and the reference macaque genome assembly .
table 1 summary of the chinese rhesus macaque re - sequencing data genome size effective length number of reads number of mapped reads number of bases number of mapped bases effective depth coverage (%) 2,864,106,071 2,646,668,809 706,459,956 654,493,989 33,064,980,424 30,607,016,223 11.56 95.95 snp identification for snp identification , we utilized a statistical model based on bayesian algorithms that has been used in human resequencing analysis [ 18 ] .
a consensus sequence ( cns ) was then obtained , and a series of criteria were used to filter out the unreliable portion of the cns for snp detection ( see materials and methods ) .
after filtering , a total of 5.5 million snps were detected ( error rate <= 1 %) , of which 2.94 million are heterozygous ( two alleles are different in chinese macaque as supported by at least four reads for each allele ; figure s1a in additional file 1 ) .
the remaining 2.56 million snps are homozygous ( two alleles are the same in chinese rhesus macaque but different from indian macaque as supported by at least four reads ; figure s1b in additional file 1 ) .
assuming a poisson distribution ( lambda = 11.56 ) , the expected false discovery rate with four or more supporting reads is less than 0.001 .
it has been shown that the total number of snps would reach saturation at a sequencing depth greater than ten - fold using the paired - end reads [ 20 ] .
therefore , with 11.56 - fold coverage , we likely uncovered all the snps in the genome of the chinese macaque individual .
the observed ratio of heterozygous to homozygous snps is 1.18 , similar to the ratio observed for an individual human genome [ 21 ] .
compared with the previously identified 1,476 snps across five encyclopedia of dna elements ( encode ) regions in chinese and indian macaques ( 9 chinese and 38 indian rhesus macaques ) [ 8 ] , we completely identified 305 snps located in the same approximately 150 - kb encode regions , and 68.9 % ( 210 of 305 ) of these are shared , indicating that most of the snps identified can be confirmed by the published dataset .
based on the shared snps , we conducted a hierarchical clustering analysis and the result indicates that the chinese macaque sequenced in this study clusters with the chinese macaques from [ 8 ] ( approximately unbiased value is 94 % ; figure s2 in additional file 1 ) , supporting the population identity of the sequenced chinese macaque .
additionally , our results suggest that these snps could efficiently distinguish indian - derived from chinese - derived rhesus macaques [ 15 ] .
the chromosomal distribution of snps ( excluding sexual chromosomes ) per 1 - mb window is shown in figure 1 .
the result indicates unbiased distribution of snps across the genome with a density of 2.08 snps per kilobase .
figure 1 chromosomal distribution of the autosomal snps in 1 - mb windows .
due to lower coverage ( two - fold coverage ) , we have excluded the analysis of the sex chromosomes .
identification , verification and analysis of structural variation paired - end sequencing is also a powerful tool for detecting genomic sv [ 22 ] .
when reads are aligned onto the reference , a mated pair of reads should be in the correct orientation and the distance between them should be in an allowed range depending on the insert size of the sequenced library .
if the mated pair of reads is not in a correct orientation or does not have an allowed span size , it may indicate a potential sv. we gathered abnormal mated pairs of reads for sv detection ( see materials and methods ) .
after masking unreliable svs located in gap regions of the reference genome ( the sequence alignments crossing the gap regions ) , a total of 125,150 svs were identified ( figure 2a ) , most of which ( 123,610 , 98.8 %) were deletions since deletions are easier to detect , consistent with previous reports [ 20,21,23 ] .
there were 36,969 ( 30 %) deletions overlapping with the repeat elements in the genome , and about half of the repeat elements ( 18,438 ) were alu elements ( table s2 in additional file 1 ) .

( b ) the size distribution of the predicted deletion lengths minus the observed deletion sv lengths for the experimentally tested deletion svs .
( c ) the size distribution of the corrected deletion svs .
( d ) the genome - wide distribution of deletions .
to evaluate the reliability of the svs based on our computational strategy , we focused on the deletions , which account for 98.8 % of the identified svs .
we randomly selected 100 deletions ( from the 123,610 candidate svs ) for pcr - based sequencing .
among them were 18 deletions located in repetitive regions in the genome that failed to be pcr amplified .
the remaining 82 putative deletions were successfully amplified and sequenced ; 74 of these are real deletions and the other 8 are false positive svs ( table s3 in additional file 2 ) .
altogether , the deletion identification was highly accurate .
to further study the underlying mechanism of the deletions , we analyzed their length and sequence features .
based on the sequenced 74 deletions , we first compared the observed deletion lengths with the predicted pattern ( figure 2b ) .
the length of the predicted deletion is 143 bp , on average , which is larger than that of the observed average ( table s4 in additional file 2 ) , likely due to the method used for identifying svs ( see materials and methods ) .
we further corrected the predicted deletion length and surveyed the size distribution of the deletions ( figure 2c ) .
genome - wide distribution of these deletions indicates that 62.8 % of the deletions are located in intergenic regions and 34.5 % are in intronic regions ( figure 2d ) .
compared with the randomly selected equivalent regions in the genome ( a total of 105,000 regions with 5,000 from each of the 21 chromosomes ) , we observed a significant bias ( p < 0.001 , chi - squared test with 1,000 replicates by monte carlo simulation ) for intergenic regions , suggesting deletions occur more frequently in regions with low functional constraint .
we also tested whether the 74 experimentally verified deletions are polymorphic within chinese macaque populations .
we selected 20 chinese rhesus macaques derived from four distinct geographical sites ( 5 from sichuan province , 5 from yunnan province , 5 from guangxi province , and 5 from guizhou province ; figure s3 in additional file 1 ). of the 74 deletions , 23 are fixed ( homozygous ) , 45 are polymorphic , and the remaining 6 are uncertain ( table s5 in additional file 2 ) .
this result suggests that a substantial portion of svs inferred by comparing chinese and indian macaques are polymorphic , and those svs fixed in chinese macaques are particularly valuable as novel genetic markers for determining the geographic origins of macaques .
gene - based variations nonsynonymous snps are believed to make a significant contribution to phenotypic variation within populations [ 24 ] .
they are also good candidate mutations that may explain mendelian diseases .
thus , we mapped the 5.5 million snps to annotated macaque genes ( ensembl ) [ 25 ] to identify the nonsynonymous snps in the genome ; we found 43,959 snps in coding regions , of which 18,324 snps are nonsynonymous , accounting for approximately 41.7 % of snps in the coding regions .
variations of orthologous disease and drug - target genes one of the primary goals of the chinese macaque genome resequencing is to maximize the use of the rhesus macaque genome sequence in the context of biomedical research .
revealing genetic variations located in disease - related and drug - target genes in macaques should be helpful to this purpose .
our preliminary analysis identified a total of 6,823 macaque orthologs of human disease genes , of which 4,558 orthologs have at least one snp in the coding regions , and 2,462 orthologs have at least one nonsynonymous snp ( figure 3a ) .
overall , we observed 15,005 snps within the coding regions of these genes , of which 9,818 are synonymous and 5,187 are nonsynonymous .
additionally , we analyzed sv distribution in the 6,823 macaque disease orthologs .
a total of 4,508 orthologous macaque disease genes bear at least one sv and there are 20,775 svs within these genes ( approximately 88.9 % of svs are located in introns ) .

snp and nssnp denote synonymous and non - synonymous snps , respectively .
omim , online mendelian inheritance in man .
we also performed a similar analysis on the drug - target genes .
genetic variants within the drug - target genes would have the potential to influence drug effects and could be a valuable resource for pharmacogenomic study .
we mapped the variants to the macaque orthologs of human drug - target genes downloaded from drugbank [ 26 ] .
a total of 954 orthologous macaque drug - target genes have at least one snp in the coding regions , and 483 of them bear at least one nonsynonymous snps ( figure 3b ) .
overall , we observed 2,980 snps within the coding regions of these genes , and 962 of them are nonsynonymous and 2,018 are synonymous .
in addition , the 949 orthologous macaque drug - target genes have at least one sv in the genomic regions and there are 4,091 svs within these genes .
protein domains form functional units that are often the targets of drugs ; these are called ' druggable domains' [ 27 ] .
thus , nonsynonymous snps within druggable domains are more likely correlated with clinical variations during drug treatment .
to study this , we used 962 identified nonsynonymous snps within the coding regions of 483 macaque drug - target orthologs to identify snps within the druggable domains ( see materials and methods ) .
a total of 478 nonsynonymous snps located in 273 unique genes were identified in the druggable domains ( table s6 in additional file 3 ) .
meanwhile , to detect whether these snp - containing druggable domains in the macaque drug - target orthologs also have snps in their human counterparts , polydoms , a previously developed database that maps all coding snps in protein domains [ 28 ] , was used to search for snps located in the same domains using macaque orthologs as the query .
in total , 671 unique nonsynonymous snps were discovered in the same druggable domains ( table s6 in additional file 3 ) .
these shared druggable domain snps between chinese macaque and human provide a highly useful tool to access between - individual drug treatment variations in preclinical trials using macaques .
the chinese macaque genetic variation database we have established the chinese macaque single nucleotide polymorphism ( cmsnp ) database [ 29 ] for data visualization .
we integrated our variation and other associated data into gbrowse , a popular genome browser used in the gmod project [ 30 ] ( table 2 ) .
we have also integrated annotated macaque genes [ 25 ] and micrornas [ 31 ] into the cmsnp database for the purpose of understanding genetic variations at the gene level , as well as orthologous macaque disease and drug - target genes , which is helpful to further biomedical research .
finally , the evolutionarily conserved regions between human and macaque were added in gbrowse [ 32 ] , which can be used to understand the genetic variations within these conserved regions .
all data have been organized into a mysql relational database , which is efficient in retrieving data from indexed files .

conclusions the variation map of rhesus macaque provides a useful framework for further genome - wide association studies and also has important applications to evolutionary and functional studies .
materials and methods dna sequencing genomic dna was purified from a 4 - year - old male chinese rhesus macaque from sichuan province of china .
the standard phenol - chloroform method was used for dna extraction .
the genomic dna was fragmented by nebulization with compressed nitrogen gas .
the overhangs of the fragments were converted to blunt ends using t4 dna polymerase and klenow polymerase .
after adding an ' a ' base to the blunt ends of the double - stranded dna fragments , adaptors with ' t ' base overhangs were ligated to the genomic dna fragments .
these fragments were separated on an agarose gel and excised from the gel at the dna band around 200 bp. finally , the dna fragments were enriched by a ten - cycle pcr process .
dna sequencing was performed using an illumina genome analyser ( solexa , san diego , california usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
fluorescent image deconvolution , quality value calculation and sequence conversion were carried out using the illumina base - calling pipeline .
snp and structural variation identification all sequenced reads were aligned to the reference rhesus macaque genome ( rhemac2 ) using soap2 [ 17 ] , with two mismatches allowed .
after alignment , we used a statistical model based on bayesian theory and the illumina quality system to calculate the probability of each possible genotype of each position on the reference genome .
at each position , the genotype was called by the highest probability , and a cns was then obtained .
the final cns probabilities were transformed to quality scores in the phred scale .
snps were obtained by a combination of parameters set to filter the cns .
the candidate snps were extracted from the cns and then filtered using defined criteria to obtain the final snp set .
the filter criteria used included a q20 quality cutoff ( quality score >= 20 or error rate < 1 %) , estimated copy number of flanking sequences (< 2 ) , minimum distance of two given snps (>= 5 bp ) , and overall depth (<= 100 ) in a given position in the reference .
for both homozygous and heterozygous snps we required the support of at least four reads for each allele .
using cumulative poisson statistics ( lambda = 11.56 ) , the expected false discovery rate with four or more supported reads is less than 0.001 .
we compared the called snps in this study with previously identified snps across five encode regions for data evaluation .
hierarchical clustering analysis with 1,000 bootstraps based on the locally shared snps was conducted to determine the population identity of the sequenced chinese macaque .
we also determined the chromosomal distribution of snps ( excluding sexual chromosomes due to half coverage compared with autosomes ) using 1 - mb windows .
according to the span size between the mapped paired - end reads and their orientations , alignments are divided into two types .
the first type is the normal mated pair , which has the correct orientation and an allowed span size , and the other type is defined as an abnormal mated pair , which can be used for sv detection .
svs were called if the lengths were more than three times the standard deviation of the insert size of the dna library .
the insert sizes of all libraries constructed were 200 bp. for sv identification , we grouped the abnormal read pairs into diagnostic paired - end clusters .
in order to avoid misalignment , each detected sv should be supported by at least four reads .
we then examined and organized the svs into alignment models , including deletion , insertion , inversion , translocation , duplication , and so on. different types of svs have a predefined mated pair alignment pattern that is inferred from the solexa sequencing technology .
for example , if there is a deletion in the sequenced individual , the mated pair of reads across the break point may have an abnormal span size but the correct orientation when aligned to the reference .
svs that overlap another sv in a spanned region were defined as complex svs .
verification of structural variation to verify sv , we randomly chose 100 deletions .
primers were designed by using the deletion region and the flanking 150 - bp sequences ( primers are listed table s3 in additional file 2 ) .
in addition , we also tested whether these deletions are polymorphic by screening 20 chinese rhesus macaques from different geographic origins .
all the 20 chinese rhesus macaques were males and the blood samples were obtained from kunming primate research center , chinese academy of sciences .
dna was isolated by the standard phenol - chloroform method .
snps in disease genes the identification of disease gene orthologs in the macaque genome was conducted through canonically reciprocal best - to - best hits implemented in the blastp program with default parameters between human proteins encoded by disease genes compiled from the online mendelian inheritance in man database [ 33 ] and macaque annotated proteins ( for each gene , the longest transcript was selected ) ; all synonymous and nonsynonymous snps were then annotated and assigned to macaque orthologs of human disease genes .
snps in druggable protein domains for identification of nonsynonymous snps within druggable protein domains , first all orthologous macaque druggable protein targets were identified through canonically reciprocal best - to - best hits implemented in the blastp program with default parameters between human druggable protein targets downloaded from the drugbank database [ 26 ] and macaque annotated proteins ( for each gene , the longest length of cds was selected ) .
a series of perl scripts were then parsed to identify 483 nonsynonymous snp - containing druggable orthologs .
finally , based on druggable human protein domains documented in the drugbank database , human druggable protein targets were blatted against protein domain data downloaded from the pfam ( 23.0 ) database [ 34 ] to identify the location of druggable domains ; muscle [ 35 ] alignment followed by perl scripts were used to extract the corresponding nonsynonymous - snp - containing druggable domains .
to identify the human snps within the domains detected in macaque , we used 273 gene symbols as queries to search in the polydoms database , which integrates all coding snps in human protein domains .
database construction the cmsnp database contains two main datasets , an snp dataset and an sv dataset , which are generated from our resequencing data .
the annotated macaque gene dataset and the known macaque microrna dataset were obtained from the ensembl biomart ( release 51 ) [ 25 ] and the sanger mirbase ( release 12 ) [ 31 ] , respectively .
we also downloaded three additional datasets from the evolutionarily conserved regions database ( ecrbase ) [ 32 ] , including the promoter dataset , the synteny dataset ( between human and macaque ) , and the evolutionarily conserved region dataset .
a series of perl scripts were used to convert these datasets into the gff ( general feature format ) file format .
then , as the gbrowse tutorial [ 36 ] recommends , we used bp _ load _ gff.pl to import all gff - formatted files into the mysql relational database .

the discovery of th17 cell plasticity , in which cd4 + il - 17 - producing th17 cells give rise to il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing cells and th1 - like ifngamma + ex - th17 lymphocytes , has raised questions regarding which of these cell types contribute to immunopathology during inflammatory diseases .
in this study , we show using helicobacter hepaticus - induced intestinal inflammation that il - 17acre - or rag1cre - mediated deletion of tbx21 has no effect on the generation of il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing cells , but leads to a marked absence of th1 - like ifngamma + ex - th17 cells .
despite the lack of th1 - like ex - th17 cells , the degree of h. hepaticus - triggered intestinal inflammation in mice in which tbx21 was excised in il - 17 - producing or rag1 - expressing cells is indistinguishable from that observed in control mice .
in stark contrast , using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , we show that il - 17acre - mediated deletion of tbx21 prevents the conversion of th17 cells to il - 17a / ifn - gamma double - producing cells as well as th1 - like ifn - gamma + ex - th17 cells .
however , il - 17acre - mediated deletion of tbx21 has only limited effects on disease course in this model and is not compensated by ag - specific th1 cells .
il - 17acre - mediated deletion of rorc reveals that rorgammat is essential for the maintenance of the th17 cell lineage , but not immunopathology during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis .
these results show that neither the single th17 subset , nor its progeny , is solely responsible for immunopathology or autoimmunity .
introduction the immune system needs to rapidly and robustly respond to pathogenic threats , whereas inappropriate responses to benign stimuli must be avoided .
for a long time , the cd4 - expressing th cells that orchestrate adaptive immune responses were thought to consist of two subsets , the th type 1 ( th1 ) and th type 2 ( th2 ) cells ( 1 ) .
regulatory t cells ( treg ) were identified based on their ability to prevent autoimmunity ( 2 ) and were able to reduce the activity of both th1 and th2 subsets , thereby upholding the paradigm of two ultimate effector lineage fates .
however , in recent years , this paradigm has undergone substantial revision .
upon activation , ag - inexperienced cd4 + t cells can differentiate into multiple lineages , including th1 , th2 , treg , th17 , th9 , and follicular th cells ( tfh ) ( 3 ) .
the development of these th subsets is determined by the local environment , and especially , but not exclusively , the cytokines present ( 4 , 5 ) .
th subsets are largely defined by the signature cytokines they produce and their lineage - associated transcription factors .
thus , th1 cells are characterized by their expression of the cytokine ifn - gamma and the transcription factor t box expressed in t cells ( tbet ) ( 6 ) .
th2 cells express il - 4 , - 5 , - 13 , and gata3 ( 7 ) .
treg cells are defined by the expression of forkhead box p3 ( foxp3 ) ( 8 ) , and th17 cells express il - 17 , il - 17f , and rorgammat and roralpha ( 9 ) .
each th subset is often ascribed a specific role in immunity , such as providing help to clear intracellular pathogens ( th1 ) , helminths ( th2 ) , and extracellular bacteria and fungi ( th17 ) ( 3 ) .
furthermore , th subsets also play a prominent role in aberrant immunity .
although th1 cells were initially thought to be critical in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis , type 1 diabetes , and multiple sclerosis , the focus rapidly shifted to th17 cells being involved in these diseases ( 10 , 11 ) .
shortly after the first description of th17 cells , cd4 + t cells producing both il - 17 and ifn - gamma ( th1 / th17 or il - 17 / ifn - gamma double producers ) were discovered in both humans and mice ( 12 , 13 ) , their frequency sometimes outnumbering il - 17 or ifn - gamma single producers ( 14 ) .
these il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing cells coexpress rorgammat and tbet ( 15 - 17 ) .
detailed studies in mice revealed not only the presence of il - 17 / ifn - gamma double producers ( 16 , 18 , 19 ) , but the existence of ifngamma + ex - th17 cells .
using a fate reporter system in which il - 17 - secreting cells are permanently marked , a near complete conversion of th17 cells to an ifn - secreting th1 - like phenotype could be observed ( 20 ) .
these th1 - like ifngamma + ex - th17 cells have ceased to express most characteristic factors associated with the th17 lineage , such as il - 17 and rorgammat ( 16 , 19 - 21 ) , and instead express tbet and runt - related transcription factor ( runx ) family members ( 22 ) .
the pathogenic potential of tbet - expressing ex - th17 cells remains controversial .
mouse models of autoimmunity in which th17 cells have been implicated in disease pathogenesis have been reported by several laboratories to be dependent on tbet ( 23 - 29 ) , yet others have observed that in vitro polarized tbet - deficient th17 cells or tbet - deficient cd4 + t cells maintain a high pathogenic potential ( 30 , 31 ) .
in this study , we investigated whether the th17 cell lineage and its tbet - and ifn - gamma - expressing progeny are directly responsible for immunopathology during inflammatory responses associated with the th17 cell lineage .
we used two models of inflammation , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( eae ) and the helicobacter hepaticus typhlocolitis model , to examine whether conversion of th17 cells into th1 - like cells ( defined by the expression of tbet and ifn - gamma , and absence of rorgammat , il - 17a , and il - 17f ) is necessary for immunopathology .
the use of an il - 17a - cre mouse ( 20 ) enabled us to track the fate of cells of the th17 cell lineage as well as conditionally remove genes of interest specifically in il - 17 - producing cells and their descendants .
as a control , we also made use of a rag1 - cre mouse to allow us to study the influence of rag1cre - mediated excision of similar genes .
we show that the il - 17acre - or rag1cre - mediated removal of tbx21 does not impact on the generation of il - 17 / ifn - gamma double producers , but markedly blocks the generation of th17 cell - derived th1 - like cells during h. hepaticus - induced colitis without reducing immunopathology .
during eae both il - 17 / ifn - gamma double producers and th17 cell - derived th1 - like cells are markedly reduced after il - 17acre - mediated tbx21 deletion , but this only modestly reduced immunopathology .
finally , we demonstrate using rag1deltatbet , rag1deltaroralpha , and il - 17adeltarorgammat mice that neither th17 cell conversion toward th1 - like cells , long - term maintenance of th17 cells , nor tbet expression in lymphocytes is essential for the induction of eae .
together , our findings imply that t cell - associated pathogenicity may not be solely attributed to the tbet - and ifn - gamma - expressing progeny of the th17 cell lineage .
materials and methods mice c57bl / 6j , il - 17acre rosastop - tdrfp ( 20 ) , il - 17acre tbx21fl / fl rosastop - tdrfp , il - 17acre eomesodermin ( eomes ) fl / fl rosastop - tdrfp , rag1cre rosastop - tdrfp ( 32 ) , rag1cre tbx21fl / fl rosastop - tdrfp , rag1cre roralphafl / fl rosastop - tdrfp , rag2 - / - ( 33 ) , and ifn - gammaeyfp [ yeti ; yellow - enhanced transcript for ifn - gamma ( 34 )] , all on the c57bl6 / j strain , were bred at the babraham institute .
il - 17acre rorgammatfl / fl rosastop - tdrfp were bred at the university of birmingham .
tbx21fl / fl and eomesfl / fl ( 35 ) were obtained from s. reiner ( department of microbiology and immunology and department of pediatrics , college of physicians and surgeons , columbia university , new york , ny ) , roralphafl / fl ( 36 ) from a. mckenzie ( medical research council laboratory of molecular biology , cambridge , u.k. ) , and rorgammatfl / fl from jax laboratories .
all animals were bred and maintained under specific pathogen - free conditions , and experiments were conducted in accordance with the united kingdom scientific procedures act ( 1986 ) under project licenses authorized by the united kingdom home office and local ethical review committees ( eae , babraham ; h. hepaticus , york ) .
animals employed tested negative for abs to specific murine viruses , including murine norovirus , were free of helicobacter spp. as assessed by pcr , and were > 6 wk old when used .
in vitro t cell cultures for t cell differentiations , naive cd4 + cd62l + t cells were isolated from spleens by magnetic beads following the manufacturer 's instructions ( miltenyi biotec ) , or by flow cytometric sorting of cd4 + cd25 - cd26l + cd44lo cells to > 98 % purity , as previously described ( 37 ) .
briefly , cells were cultured in imdm supplemented with 2 mm l - glutamine , 100 u / ml penicillin , 100 mug / ml streptomycin , 5 x 10 - 5 m 2 - me , and 5 % fbs .
th17 and th1 cells were differentiated in 96 - well plates coated with 2 mug / ml anti - cd3 ( clone 2c11 ; bioxcell ) and 2 mug / ml anti - cd28 ( clone 37.51 ; bioxcell ) in the presence of either 20 ng / ml il - 6 , 0.2 ng / ml tgf - beta1 ( peprotech ) , 10 mug / ml anti - ifn - gamma ( clone xmg1.2 ; bioxcell ) , and 5 mug / ml anti - il - 4 ( clone 11b11 ; bioxcell ) ( th17 condition ) or 2 ng / ml il - 12 ( peprotech ) and 5 mug / ml anti - il - 4 ( th1 condition ) .
for t cell proliferation , naive cd4 + t cells were loaded with 2.5 mum cfse ( lifesciences ) .
eae induction for active eae induction , animals were injected s.c. with 250 mug myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( mog ) 35 - 55 peptide ( proimmune ) emulsified in ifa ( sigma - aldrich , gillingham , u.k. ) supplemented with 250 mug mycobacterium tuberculosis extract h37ra ( difco ) .
the animals also received 200 ng pertussis toxin ( list biological laboratories ) i.p. on days 0 and 2 .
for passive eae induction , cd4 + rfp + cells were sorted by flow cytometry from lymph nodes and spleens of eae - induced il - 17acre rosastop - tdrfp mice on day 17 post - mog peptide immunization , and 2 x 105 cd4 + rfp + cells (> 98 % pure ) were injected i.v. into rag2 - / - mice .
rag2 - / - hosts were injected s.c. with 250 mug mog35 - 55 peptide ( proimmune ) emulsified in ifa ( sigma - aldrich ) supplemented with 250 mug m. tuberculosis extract h37ra ( difco ) 5 wk after adoptive transfer .
clinical signs of eae were assessed blindly and according to the following scores : 0 , no signs of disease ; 1 , flaccid tail ; 2 , impaired righting reflex and / or gait ; 3 , partial hind limb paralysis ; 4 , total hind limb paralysis ; and 5 , total hind limb paralysis with partial forelimb paralysis. h. hepaticus infection to induce typhlocolitis , mice were allocated to treatment groups and inoculated intragastrically with 1.5 x 107 h. hepaticus nci - frederick isolate 1a ( 38 ) , isolated from the same mouse colony as isolate hh - 1 ( american type culture collection strain 51449 ) ( 39 ) and treated i.p. with 1 mg anti - il - 10r ( clone 1b1.3a ) on days 0 and 7 of h. hepaticus infection , as described previously ( 40 ) .
one week after the last mab injection , mice were sacrificed , and mesenteric lymph nodes ( mln ) and large intestines ( cecum and colon ) were collected for analysis .
a piece of ascending colon (~ 1 cm from the cecum ) was fixed in buffered 10 % formalin , and paraffin - embedded sections were stained with h & e ( mary lyon centre at mrc harwell , oxfordshire , u.k. ) .
histology sections were evaluated in a blinded fashion using a scoring system based on epithelial hyperplasia and lamina propria ( lp ) cellularity ( 0 to 3 each ) , and goblet cell depletion , submucosal inflammation , edema , crypt abscesses , and ulcers ( 0 to 1 each ) .
a total score was calculated by adding the individual scores .
a typical score for a noninflamed colon is < 1.5 .
cell preparations and flow cytometry for eae experiments , single - cell suspensions were prepared from spleens , lymph nodes , lungs , peyer 's patches , and spinal cord .
cns - infiltrating immune cells were isolated from the spinal cord by isolating the soft tissue from the spine and mashing it through 70 - mum mesh filter , followed by 36.5 % percoll ( sigma - aldrich ) separation .
for h. hepaticus experiments , single - cell suspensions were prepared from mln .
ceca and colons were cut into 3 - to 5 - mm pieces and incubated twice in rpmi 1640 containing 10 mm hepes , 100 u / ml penicillin , 100 mug / ml streptomycin , 2 mm glutamine , 1 % fcs , 1 mm dtt , and 5 mm edta for 20 min at 37degreesc while shaking to release epithelial cells .
tissue pieces were then digested with liberase tl ( 0.3125 mg / ml ; roche , burgess hill , u.k. ) and dnase i ( 125 u / ml ; sigma - aldrich ) in rpmi 1640 containing 10 mm hepes , 100 u / ml penicillin , 100 mug / ml streptomycin , 2 mm glutamine , and 1 % fcs for 1 h at 37degreesc while shaking .
the resulting tissue suspension was passed through a 70 - mum cell strainer , centrifuged , resuspended in 40 % percoll , and underlayed with 80 % percoll .
after centrifugation at 600 x g for 20 min at 10degreesc , lp cells were recovered from the 40 / 80 % interface and resuspended in medium .
for cytokine profiles , cells were stimulated for 4 h with 500 ng / ml pdbu and 500 ng / ml ionomycin ( eae experiments ) or 10 ng / ml pma and 1 mug / ml ionomcin ( h. hepaticus experiments ) in the presence of brefeldin a ( all reagents from sigma - aldrich ) .
cells were stained with anti - cd4 , anti - cxcr5 , anti - cd44 , anti - cd3 , and anti - pd1 ( eae experiments ) or anti - cd4 and anti - cd3 ( hh experiments ) and a fixable viability dye , followed by intracellular staining with anti - il - 17a , anti - il - 17f , anti - ifn - gamma , anti - tnf , anti - gm - csf ( all biolegend ) ( eae experiments ) or anti - il - 17a , anti - ifn - gamma , and anti - tbet ( all from ebioscience ) ( hh experiments ) .
the proportion and absolute numbers of t cells were determined by including counting beads ( spherotech ) .
i - ab / mog38 - 49 tetramer was obtained through the national institutes of health tetramer facility and used according to their guidelines .
samples were analyzed on a fortessa 4 flow cytometer ( bd biosciences ) ( eae experiments ) or a cyan adp flow cytometer ( beckman coulter ) ( hh experiments ) , and data were analyzed using flowjo software ( tree star ) .
statistical analysis the p values were calculated with a two - tailed student t test .
differences were considered statistically significant with p < 0.05 .
significance is indicated as follows : * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , and *** p < 0.001 .
results immunopathology coincides with appearance of th17 - derived ifn - gamma producers we have previously reported in eae that th17 - derived th1 - like cells become the dominant t cell population in the cns ( 20 ) .
to examine the role of tbet in th17 cells and their th1 - like progeny in pathology , we made use of two models in which th17 to th1 - like cell conversion has been established : eae and the h. hepaticus typhlocolitis model ( 16 , 20 ) .
using il - 17acre rosa26stop - tdrfp lineage - reporter mice ( from hereon called il - 17awt mice ) in which a cell that has turned on il - 17 production is specifically and permanently marked with rfp , we readily detected within the rfp + cd4 + t cell population the presence of single il - 17 ( 6 - 36 %) , double il - 17 / ifn - gamma ( 9 - 23 %) , and single ifn - gamma producers ( 13 - 70 %) .
these cell populations were found in il - 17awt mice with eae or h. hepaticus - induced colitis both at the site of inflammation ( cns and lp , respectively ) and in draining lymph nodes ( fig. 1a ) .
under steady state conditions in the large intestine , the proportions of il - 17 - or ifn - gamma - producing cd4 + t cells average at 3 - 4 % , indicating that the enhanced frequencies of cytokine - positive cd4 + t cells observed in the intestine are induced following h. hepaticus inoculation ( data not shown ) ( 16 ) .
to gain insight into the generation and distribution of these three subpopulations , we performed a kinetic analysis upon eae induction .
we analyzed il - 17 and ifn - gamma expression in rfp + cd4 + t cells of il - 17awt mice in draining ( inguinal ) lymph nodes , the peritoneal cavity , blood , spleen , lungs , and the cns before mog35 - 55 immunization , at day 6 prior to onset of clinical signs ( presym ) , and at day 17 during established eae ( peak ) .
in secondary lymphoid tissues , peritoneal cavity , blood , and lung , the fraction of th17 cells ( il - 17 single positive ) within the rfp + cd4 + t cell compartment increased during the presymptomatic phase , and regressed at the peak of the disease in favor of il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing cells and ifn - gamma - producing ex - th17 cells ( fig. 1b ) .
in the cns , all three cell populations were detectable at their highest levels at the peak of the disease ( fig. 1b ) .
we confirmed that rfp + cells were the majority of cd4 + t cells present in the cns at the peak of the disease , and 46.1 % +/ - 17.41 of these rfp + cells were ifn - gamma single - producing ex - th17 cells ( data not shown ) .
the total number of th17 cells in inguinal lymph nodes ( iln ) declined during peak of clinical eae symptoms , whereas in all other organs total th17 cell numbers were highest at the peak of the disease ( fig. 1b ) .
il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing t cell numbers remained low before disease onset , and increased during the peak clinical phase in all organs ( fig. 1b ) .
numbers of ex - th17 cells , with a th1 - like profile ( rfp + , ifn - gamma + , il - 17 - ) , increased during peak clinical scores in all organs ( fig. 1b ) and also outnumbered bona fide th1 cells in the ilns , blood , spleen , and cns ( data not shown ) ( 20 ) .
thus , the majority of cd4 + t cells present in the target organ during eae in il - 17awt mice are th17 cells , and their progeny have converted to an il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing or th1 cell - like phenotype .
the appearance of these latter two populations coincides with the onset and maintenance of clinical disease .
figure 1 .
the th17 cell lineage dominates during inflammation .
il - 17a fate - reporter mice ( il - 17awt ) were subjected to mog / cfa administration to induce eae or given h. hepaticus ( hh ) plus anti - il - 10r mab to induce typhlocolitis , and the cytokine - secreting phenotype of th17 lineage - positive ( rfp +) cd4 + cells was assessed at different time points .

data are representative of two independent experiments ( average +/ - sem , n = 6 ) , *** p < 0.001 .
to determine what cell population harbors ag - specific t cells , we used mog38 - 49 mhc - ii tetramer staining in il - 17acre rosa26stop - tdrfp ifn - gammaeyfp mice ( from hereon called il - 17awtifn - gammaeyfp mice ) in which il - 17 is lineage marked by rfp and ifn - gamma protein expression reported via eyfp ( 20 , 41 ) .
we determined the proportion of mog38 - 49 mhc - ii tetramer - positive cells within activated cd4 + cd44hi t cells that were negative for rfp and eyfp , single positive for either , or positive for both .
in line with an important role for th17 cells in the initiation of eae ( 11 ) , the majority of ag - specific cd4 + t cells in the cns was found within the th17 cells ( eyfp - rfp +) and the th17 cell - derived il - 17 / ifn - gamma double or ifn - gamma single producers ( eyfp + rfp +) , but not in bona fide th1 cells ( eyfp + rfp - ) ( fig. 1c ) .
for h. hepaticus - induced intestinal pathology , full conversion of th17 to th1 is not required to examine the importance of the th17 to th1 - like cell conversion for the onset and progression of immunopathology , we generated mice in which tbx21 is conditionally deleted upon il - 17 expression and in which il - 17 - producing t cells are permanently marked by rfp ( il - 17acre tbx21fl / fl rosa26stop - tdrfp , from hereon called il - 17adeltatbet ) .
the il - 17adeltatbet mice exhibited normal gross development and were born according to a mendelian distribution ( data not shown ) .
moreover , we confirmed efficient and specific tbx21 excision in rfp + cells from il - 17adeltatbet mice by pcr ( data not shown ) .
the in vitro differentiation potential of naive cd4 + t cells toward the th1 or th17 cell lineages as well as their proliferation were similar in il - 17adeltatbet and il - 17awt control mice ( fig. 2a , 2b ) , demonstrating that polarization toward th17 and th1 cells was not affected by the il - 17acre - mediated removal of tbx21 .

th17 - derived th1 - like cells have been detected in h. hepaticus - induced intestinal inflammation in which their generation correlates with the development of pathology ( 16 ) .
to examine the role of tbet in th17 to th1 conversion in this model , il - 17awt and il - 17adeltatbet mice were given h. hepaticus plus anti - il - 10r mab to induce typhlocolitis , and colonic inflammation was examined 2 wk later .
to exclude the potential initiation of th17 to th1 cell conversion prior to tbx21 excision giving rise to il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing t cells , we also included in these experiments rag1cre rosastop - tdrfp and rag1cre tbx21fl / fl rosastop - tdrfp mice ( from hereon called rag1wt and rag1deltatbet mice ) .
rag1deltatbet mice allowed us to study the influence of rag1 - mediated tbx21 excision on the development of h. hepaticus - induced pathology and th17 conversion .
our findings demonstrate that the degree of colonic pathology was indistinguishable between h. hepaticus / anti - il - 10r - treated il - 17awt , il - 17adeltatbet , rag1wt , and rag1deltatbet mice ( fig. 2c ) .
within the cd4 + t cells not derived from th17 cells ( rfp - cells ) , we did not observe any differences in proportion or cell numbers expressing il - 17 or ifn - gamma between il - 17adeltatbet and il - 17awt controls ( fig. 2d , 2e ) .
as expected , very few rfp - cd4 + t cells were observed in rag1wt and rag1deltatbet mice ( fig. 2e ) .
when examining the rfp + population , the percentage of lp il - 17 single - producing th17 cells was significantly enhanced in il - 17adeltatbet compared with il - 17awt animals and in rag1deltatbet compared with rag1wt mice ( fig. 2d ) .
however , upon il - 17acre - mediated tbx21 deletion , cd4 + t cells in mln and lp failed to fully switch to th1 - like cells ( fig. 2f ) , and both the percentage and number of rfp + th1 - like cells were almost absent ( 90 % reduction ) in h. hepaticus / anti - il - 10r - treated il - 17adeltatbet compared with il - 17awt mice ( fig. 2d , 2e ) .
a similar picture was observed in the lp of rag1deltatbet mice ( fig. 2d - f ) .
it could be possible for bona fide th1 cells to compensate for the reduction in th17 - derived th1 - like cells in the il - 17adeltatbet mice .
however , we found no difference in ifn - gamma - producing cd4 + rfp - cell proportions or numbers between this strain and il - 17awt mice ( fig. 2d , 2e ). that tbx21 excision had worked efficiently in the two deltatbet strains was confirmed by flow cytometry showing the absence of tbet staining in ifn - gamma and il - 17 / ifn - gamma - producing cd4 + rfp + populations of il - 17adeltatbet and rag1deltatbet mice , but the presence of tbet in the cd4 + rfp + cells from il - 17awt and rag1wt animals ( fig. 2g , 2h ) .
together , these data indicate that colonic immunopathology during h. hepaticus - induced typhlocolitis does not depend on the generation of tbet - and ifn - gamma - expressing ex - th17 cells or the activity of tbet ; however , a role for il - 17 / ifn - gamma double producers cannot be excluded .
conditional deletion of tbet prevents th17 to th1 cell conversion in eae the role of specific cd4 + th subsets in eae pathogenesis remains poorly understood with conflicting findings in the literature [ for review , see ( 42 )] , but so - called polyfunctional t cells or il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing cd4 + t cells have been implicated in the disease process ( 43 ) .
to examine the role of tbet in th17 cell plasticity in eae , we performed a detailed analysis of lineage - marked th17 cells and their progeny in il - 17awt versus il - 17adeltatbet mice .
upon mog35 - 55 immunization , th17 cells were readily detected in the iln and cns of il - 17awt and il - 17adeltatbet mice ( fig. 3a ) .
compared with the il - 17awt hosts , we found an enhanced proportion and a 3 - fold increase in the number of il - 17 ( and il - 17f ) single - producing cells in the cns of il - 17adeltatbet mice 17 d post - mog peptide administration , indicating a greater stability of the il - 17 - producing th17 cell profile upon tbx21 excision ( figs. 3b , 3c , 4d ) .
consistent with the findings in h. hepaticus - induced colitis , th17 - derived ifn - gamma + th1 - like cells were absent in il - 17adeltatbet mice compared with il - 17awt controls at this same time point after eae induction ( fig. 3a - c ) .
however , in marked contrast to h. hepaticus - induced colitis , both the proportion and number of il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing t cells were reduced (> 95 %) during eae ( fig. 3a - c ) .
as eomes can be an important mediator of t cell ifn - gamma expression and t cell cytotoxicity ( 44 ) , we next used mice in which eomes is conditionally deleted in il - 17 - expressing cells ( il - 17adeltaeomes mice ) .
our data show that the proportions of il - 17 - and ifn - gamma - producing t cells were indistinguishable in il - 17adeltaeomes and il - 17awt control mice ( fig. 3a ) .
together , these results demonstrate that tbet , but not eomes , is required for the efficient conversion of th17 cells to il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing and ifn - gamma single - producing cd4 + t cells in the eae model .

as th17 cells have also been shown to convert to tfh in the intestine ( 45 ) , we next analyzed th17 - derived tfh cells in peyer 's patches in nonimmunized il - 17awt versus il - 17adeltatbet mice .
th17 - derived tfh cells ( identified as cd4 + rfp + cxcr5 + pd - 1 + cells ) were detected in similar proportions in peyer 's patches of il - 17awt controls and il - 17adeltatbet mice ( fig. 3d ) , together suggesting that tbet is not required for the conversion of th17 cells to tfh cells .
furthermore , it highlights that tbet is not required for the conversion of th17 cells per se , but only for the generation of ifn - gamma - producing th1 - like cells .
these results indicate that the il - 17adeltatbet mouse is a promising model to specifically study the role of th17 to th1 plasticity in autoimmunity and infection .
tbet - deficient th17 cell populations have an altered cytokine profile because th17 cells and il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing t cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of eae , we analyzed the cytokine profile of the th17 cell lineage in the presence or absence of tbet .
seventeen days after induction of eae , the cd4 + t cell populations present in the cns were analyzed for their cytokine profile by flow cytometry .
as expected , inflammatory cytokines assayed , with the exception of gm - csf , were enriched within the rfp + th17 cell lineage compared with the rfp - population ( fig. 4a - c ) ( 20 ) .
no significant difference in cytokine production by the rfp - non - th17 lineage - derived cells was found between il - 17awt and il - 17adeltatbet hosts ( fig. 4a - c ) .
the prevention of th17 to th1 cell conversion in il - 17adeltatbet mice resulted in changes in cytokine profiles of the th17 cell - derived populations .
il - 17f - expressing cells were significantly increased in the tbet - deficient th17 cell population ( fig. 4a , 4d ) .
this increase in number was found in all rfp + th17 cell - derived populations independent of their il - 17 expression profile .
the proportion and number of gm - csf - expressing t cells , a cytokine strongly associated with autoimmunity and required for the induction of eae ( 46 ) , were significantly altered in the th17 cell population from il - 17adeltatbet mice compared with controls .
thus , in the absence of tbet , there were more il - 17 + gm - csf - rfp + cells , whereas in the presence of tbet there were more il - 17 - gm - csf + rfp + cells ( fig. 4b ) .
although the total proportion of gm - csf - expressing cd4 + t cells was reduced , the total number of cells expressing gm - csf was not significantly altered when the th17 cell subset was tbet sufficient or deficient ( fig. 4d ) .
expression of tnf followed a similar pattern as gm - csf .
in the absence of tbet , there were more il - 17 + tnf - rfp + cells , whereas in the presence of tbet there were more that have lost their il - 17 expression ( il - 17 - tnf + rfp +) cells ( fig. 4c ) .
the combination of rfp + cells expressing both il - 17 and tnf was significantly higher in the il - 17adeltatbet mice compared with the il - 17awt controls ( fig. 4c ) .
the overall proportion of tnf - producing cells was , however , not significantly different in cd4 + t cells from il - 17adeltatbet mice ( 85.4 +/ - 5 ) compared with il - 17awt controls ( 76.5 +/ - 6 ) ( fig. 4d ) .
these results suggest that tnf and gm - csf expression do not depend on the expression of tbet and may precede the conversion of th17 to th1 - like cells .
furthermore , it shows that tbet expression alters the combination of cytokines simultaneously expressed by the same t cell , but does not affect the total number of tnf - or gm - csf - producing cd4 + t cells present in the cns .
th17 to th1 cell conversion is not required for eae pathogenesis as il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing t cells have been associated with autoimmune and inflammatory pathology ( 19 , 21 , 47 , 48 ) , we next investigated the susceptibility of the il - 17adeltatbet mouse to eae .
we found no difference with respect to timing of eae onset between il - 17adeltatbet and il - 17awt controls ( fig. 5a ) .
however , the maximum clinical scores were reduced in il - 17adeltatbet hosts ( fig. 5a ) .
as tbet and other factors implicated in immunopathology , such as gm - cfs , are not exclusively expressed by the th17 cell lineage , we next assessed the susceptibility of rag1deltatbet mice in which tbet was conditionally deleted via rag1 - cre in all lymphocytes .
in this case , rag1deltatbet mice showed a more pronounced reduction in eae susceptibility , with later onset and lower maximum clinical score than il - 17awt , rag1wt controls , and il - 17adeltatbet mice ( fig. 5a ) .
this finding indicates that blocking th17 to th1 cell conversion as well as de novo th1 cell differentiation had a more pronounced impact on reducing eae pathogenesis than removal of tbet in il - 17 - expressing cells only .
however , we cannot exclude an additional role for tbet in other lymphocytes that once expressed rag1 .
as we observed in the il - 17adeltatbet animals , rag1deltatbet mice showed an increased proportion and number of il - 17 - producing cells and a marked decrease in the proportion and number of ifn - gamma - producing cd4 + t cells in the cns at day 17 post - mog immunization ( fig. 5b ) .
although no difference in the proportion of gm - csf - producing t cells was observed in rag1deltatbet mice compared with rag1wt controls , the number of gm - csf - producing cd4 + t cells in the cns was reduced in the former animals ( fig. 5b ) .
the reduction in ifn - gamma - and gm - csf - producing t cells in the cns of rag1deltatbet mice correlated with reduced maximum eae scores ( fig. 5a ) .

we subsequently investigated whether the block in th17 to th1 cell conversion was maintained long - term in vivo .
seventeen days following mog35 - 55 immunization of il - 17awt and il - 17adeltatbet mice , rfp + cd4 + t cells were isolated from the draining ilns and transferred to rag2 - / - hosts .
upon subsequent mog35 - 55 / cfa immunization of the recipient mice , a delayed onset of eae was observed in the group receiving il - 17adeltatbet rfp + cd4 + t cells , although equally high clinical scores were observed in both host groups ( fig. 5c ) .
furthermore , the majority of il - 17awt control cells had converted to a th1 - like ifn - gamma - expressing phenotype ( fig. 5d ) , whereas il - 17adeltatbet cells remained stable in their il - 17 - expressing profile and did not express ifn - gamma ( fig. 5d ) .
the distribution of tnf and gm - csf was also similar to that seen in the respective donor mice ( fig. 4b , 4c ) , with the majority of gm - csf - and tnf - producing cells found among the ifn - gamma - producing cells in il - 17awt controls , but within il - 17 - producing cells in il - 17adeltatbet cells ( fig. 5d ) .
although the majority of cd4 + t cells encountered in the cns in both il - 17adeltatbet and il - 17awt control mice were originally derived from the th17 cell subset , as we reported before in il - 17awt control mice ( 20 ) , it was possible that ag specificity could have risen in the bona fide th1 cell population .
however , mog38 - 49 tetramer staining in il - 17adeltatbetifngammaeyfp mice at day 17 after eae induction revealed that ag specificity remained within the rfp + populations , as previously seen in il - 17awtifn - gammaeyfp control mice ( fig. 1c ) , but was particularly enriched within the few remaining il - 17 / ifn - gamma double producers ( fig. 5e ) .
rorgammat is required to maintain th17 cells th17 cells rely on the roralpha and especially rorgammat for their differentiation ( 9 , 49 ) .
hence , the absence of rorgammat prevents the differentiation of th17 cells and susceptibility to eae ( 9 , 49 ) .
however , it is not clear whether these orphan receptors remain important for th17 cell maintenance .
this is of particular importance for potential therapeutic targeting of th17 cells in inflammatory disorders .
thus , we isolated naive cd4 + t cells from rag1cre roralphafl / fl rosastop - tdrfp ( from hereon called rag1deltaroralpha ) , il - 17acre rorgammatfl / fl rosastop - tdrfp ( from hereon called il - 17adeltarorgammat ) , and their respective rag1wt and il - 17awt controls , and differentiated the cells in vitro toward the th17 subset .
in vitro polarization of naive cd4 + t cells from rag1deltaroralpha and il - 17adeltarorgammat cells into th1 or th17 was indistinguishable from their respective controls ( fig. 6a ) .
moreover , il - 17acre - mediated deletion of rorc did not affect the in vitro proliferation of naive t cells under th17 - polarizing conditions ( data not shown ) .

* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 .
we next analyzed the susceptibility of rag1deltaroralpha and il - 17adeltarorgammat mice to mog35 - 55 / cfa - induced eae .
the absence of roralpha in all lymphocytes in rag1deltaroralpha hosts did not impact eae onset compared with controls , but the clinical score progression was slightly delayed in the rag1deltaroralpha hosts ( fig. 6b ) .
similarly , il - 17acre - mediated deletion of rorc in il - 17adeltarorgammat mice did not significantly delay the onset or final clinical score of eae , but resulted in a minor delay in disease progression ( fig. 6c ) .
detailed analysis of the cd4 + t cell compartment in the cns of il - 17adeltarorgammat mice revealed a significant reduction ( 71 % +/ - 12 %) in rfp + cd4 + t cells compared with that observed in il - 17awt controls , a number that contributed to the reduction in total numbers of cns - infiltrating t cells in the former strain ( fig. 6d ) .
the limited number of rfp + cd4 + t cells remaining in il - 17adeltarorgammat mice did not express il - 17 or il - 17f , but did produce ifn - gamma , with reduced proportions of tnf and gm - csf - positive t cells compared with controls ( fig. 6e ) .
the reduction in gm - csf - producing cells in il - 17adeltarorgammat mice was not compensated by gm - csf production from the rfp - t cell cns infiltrate ( fig. 6f ) .
as a result , the total number of cd4 + t cells producing il - 17 , il - 17f , gm - csf , and tnf was significantly reduced in the il - 17adeltarorgammat mice ( fig. 6g ) .
however , no significant difference in numbers of total ifn - gamma - producing cns - infiltrating t cells was found between il - 17awt and il - 17adeltarorgammat mice ( fig. 6g ) .
these data indicate that th17 cells require rorgammat not only for their initial generation , but also for their il - 17 production and long - term survival .
importantly , once th17 cells have been generated , the excision of rorc did not significantly affect the clinical outcome of eae despite the significant reduction in il - 17 - and gm - csf - producing cd4 + t cells .
discussion the mechanism underlying the pathogenicity of t cells and the identity of cd4 + t cells instrumental for the onset and maintenance of immunopathology , especially those inducing eae , are still debated in the literature .
in this study , we demonstrate that th17 cells and their tbet - and ifn - gamma - expressing progeny are the predominant populations of t cells present in eae and h. hepaticus - induced typhlocolitis , in line with their established role as potent effector cells contributing to immunity and immunopathology ( 10 , 11 ) .
to our knowledge , for the first time , we assessed the influence of the excision of tbet , eomes , roralpha , and rorgammat , in all lymphocytes or in il - 17 - expressing cells only , in the development of immunopathology in vivo .
we show that neither the ifn - gamma - producing th17 cell progeny ( ex - th17 and il - 17 / ifn - gamma double producers in the case of eae , or ex - th17 cells in the case of h. hepaticus colitis ) nor long - term th17 cell maintenance ( in the case of eae ) is essential for the establishment of t cell - mediated immunopathology .
numerous studies have shown that distinct populations of t cell subsets have the capacity to induce pathology upon adoptive transfer into lymphopenic or t cell - sufficient hosts , with different types of eae as a result ( 50 , 51 ) .
however , criticism has been raised that these cells , often bearing an ag - specific tcr and polarized in vitro with a mix of cytokines , may not accurately recapitulate the phenotype of in vivo generated effector t cells .
our study did not make use of tcr transgenic mice or the transfer of in vitro cultured cells .
instead , we employed conditional deletion , either rag1cre - or il - 17acre - mediated , of genes of interest and tracked the th17 population and its progeny with an rfp lineage marker .
we show that the generation of il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing t cells requires the expression of tbx21 in th17 cells during eae .
in stark contrast to the eae model , we further demonstrate that tbet is not an absolute requirement for the generation of these double - producing lymphocytes , as these cells were readily found in h. hepaticus typhlocolitis in rag1deltatbet and il - 17adeltatbet mice .
this may highlight the different microenvironments present in the intestine compared with the cns , providing different cues enabling the development of double - producing t cells .
furthermore , it re - emphasizes the high degree of plasticity of th17 cells and the extraordinary tailored response of the immune system , depending on microorganisms encountered , as well as the site of inflammation .
il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing t cells have been found during active colitis in mice and humans ( 18 , 21 , 52 , 53 ) ; however , their contribution to intestinal pathology is largely unknown .
a recent study by harbour et al .
( 24 ) using adoptive transfer into lymphopenic hosts of in vitro polarized th17 cells from tbx21 - / - mice showed that these cells were unable to induce colitis , despite unaffected in vivo generation of il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing cells in the recipients .
in contrast , we have previously demonstrated that il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - positive t cells isolated from the large intestine of h. hepaticus - infected colitic mice are able to induce colitis upon transfer to h. hepaticus - infected rag2 - / - mice ( 16 ) , indicating that ex vivo il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing lymphocytes isolated from tbet - sufficient mice can induce intestinal pathology .
moreover , as shown in the current study , il - 17acre - or rag1cre - mediated excision of tbx21 in cells once expressing il - 17 or rag1 had no effect on the number of il - 17 / ifn - gamma - double - producing cells , nor on the severity of immunopathology in h. hepaticus colitis .
hence , in vivo polarized cells or those encountering specific cues associated with particular pathogens such as h. hepaticus may directly contribute to colitis , independently of their ability to express tbet. of note , rag1cre - mediated excision of tbx21 did result in the presence of il - 17 / ifn - gamma double - producing cells in the absence of bona fide th1 cell development ( 6 ) , indicating that double producers are most likely th17 cell derived .
the generation of th17 - derived th1 - like cells , which have lost the expression of il - 17 , was dependent on the presence of tbet in both the h. hepaticus typhlocolitis and eae models .
importantly , the excision of tbx21 in il - 17 - producing cells had no impact on h. hepaticus - induced intestinal pathology , indicating that , in this model , th17 cell transition to ifn - gamma - producing th1 - like cells is not absolutely required for colitis development .
these findings are in contrast to those by harbour et al .
( 24 ) , who concluded that tbet expression by th17 cells is required for their transition to th1 - like cells and for mediating transfer colitis .
among possible explanations for this discrepancy is the use of different colitis models and the use of mice in which tbx21 is excised in vivo upon il - 17 or rag1 expression in our study versus the use of in vitro differentiated th17 cells from tbet - deficient mice in the report by harbour et al .
( 24 ) .
in contrast to the findings in the h. hepaticus colitis model , il - 17 - mediated deletion of tbx21 had a mild reducing impact on eae .
these results are in line with recent studies indicating that pathogenicity of ifn - gamma - producing t cells is independent or partially dependent on tbet ( 22 , 31 , 54 ) .
two studies made use of in vitro stimulated and adoptively transferred ag - specific t cells from tbx21 - deficient mice or cd4cre - mediated tbx21 excision ( 22 , 31 ) .
duhen et al .
( 54 ) used gene knockout mice or cd4cre - mediated gene excision , affecting several lineages and cell types , including cd8 t cells .
we extended these observations by employing tbx21 excision specifically in il - 17 - producing cells , and conclude that the absence of tbet in in vivo differentiated th17 cells has limited impact on immunopathology in the intestine and cns .
in line with cd4cre - mediated or germline deletion of eomes , we failed to observe effects of eomes on th17 cell polarization , plasticity , or immunopathology in the eae model ( data not shown ) .
the removal of tbx21 in all lymphocytes , through rag1cre - mediated deletion , resulted in a much more pronounced reduction of eae scores , although clinical symptoms were not completely ameliorated .
in this case , both bona fide th1 cells as well as th17 - derived th1 - like cells were largely absent , yet some immunopathology was still observed .
this suggests that even an interplay between th1 - and th17 - derived th1 - like cells is not essential for the development of eae .
in the current study , to our knowledge , we addressed for the first time whether the maintenance of th17 cells or their progeny is important for the immunopathology observed in eae .
we found a minor contribution of roralpha in eae , in line with a more essential role of rorgammat in th17 cell differentiation ( 9 , 49 ) .
moreover , the excision of rorc after the generation of th17 cells resulted in rapid loss of th17 cells , in line with results from pharmacological inhibition of rorgammat ( 55 ) .
this reveals an important role for rorgammat in maintaining th17 cells after their generation in addition to their differentiation .
the remaining th17 - derived cells exclusively produced ifn - gamma , in line with their loss of rorc that is required for the th17 lineage program , including the expression of il - 17 and il - 17f ( 9 ) .
interestingly , despite the significant reduction of cells expressing il - 17 , the marked loss of th17 cell progeny , and cells expressing gm - csf in the cns of il - 17adeltarorgammat mice , the onset and pathology of eae were only mildly affected .
although no significant reduction in eae upon il - 17acre - mediated tbx21 or rorc excision was observed , this does not exclude a role for th17 cells in the initiation of eae .
we found that both mog ag specificity and the majority of other cytokines implicated in eae pathogenicity , such as ifn - gamma , tnf , and gm - csf , were found within the th17 cell - derived lineages .
upon deletion of tbet within the th17 subset , the mog ag specificity did remain within the th17 cell lineage .
although mog ag is not the only ag involved in eae , it suggests that th17 cell polarization at the initiation of eae is sufficient to enable entry to the cns ( 56 ) .
moreover , it is clear that factors implicated in immunopathology , such as tnf and gm - csf , are not exclusive for the th17 cell - derived lineage found in the cns .
cytokine profiles were altered within the th17 cell subsets upon tbet deletion , modifying the combinations of cytokines secreted by the same t cell .
it also remains possible that the absence of tbet does allow for a partial conversion of th17 cells , but without terminating il - 17 expression or initiating the tbet transcriptional program such as ifn - gamma expression .
although combinations of cytokines produced by the same cell , such as tnf in combination with either il - 17 or ifn - gamma that result in distinct cellular responses ( 57 , 58 ) , were altered upon excision of tbx21 or rorc , the effect on immunopathology was limited .
because gm - csf has been shown to be necessary for the development of eae ( 46 , 59 , 60 ) , the alteration of t cell populations producing gm - csf / tnf in combination with il - 17 or ifn - gamma may not significantly impact on immunopathology .
extensive studies to find the pathogenicity factor ( s ) have focused on the th17 cell subset with potential novel mediators of pathology reported ( 61 ) .
however , inflammation is characterized by diversity in cell subsets , mediators , as well as clinical course and drug responsiveness ( 51 ) .
important cytokines in the th1 and th17 cell axis , with the exception of il - 6 and il - 23 , have been reported to be dispensable for the induction and clinical disease progression of eae ( 51 , 62 , 63 ) .
our work implies that a focus on a particular th subset during the pathology phase of disease may be of limited clinical benefit .
in summary , our results contribute to a growing body of evidence that immunopathology cannot be attributed to a single lineage of th cells .
instead , it is likely that multiple th cell lineages and immune cell types contribute to immunopathology .
until the identification of a lineage - independent pathogenicity factor , disease - modifying therapies may need to continue to be targeted more broadly .

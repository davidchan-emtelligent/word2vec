http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract 90y pet / ct can be acquired after 90y - microsphere selective radiation internal therapy ( sirt ) to describe radioactivity distribution .
we performed dosimetry using 90y - microsphere pet / ct data to evaluate treatment efficacy and appropriateness of activity planning from 99mtc - maa scan and spect / ct. twenty - three patients with liver malignancy were included in the study .
99mtc - maa was injected during planning angiography and whole body 99mtc - maa scan and liver spect / ct were acquired .
after sirt using 90y - resin microsphere , 90y - microsphere pet / ct was acquired .
a partition model ( pm ) using 4 compartments ( tumor , intarget normal liver , out - target normal liver , and lung ) was adopted , and absorbed dose to each compartment was calculated based on measurements from 99mtc - maa spect / ct and 90y - microsphere pet / ct , respectively , to be compared with each other .
progression - free survival ( pfs ) was evaluated in terms of tumor absorbed doses calculated by 99mtc - maa spect / ct and 90y - microsphere pet / ct results .
lung shunt fraction was overestimated on 99mtc - maa scan compared with 90y - microsphere pet / ct ( 0.060 +/ - 0.037 vs. 0.018 +/ - 0.026 , p < 0.01 ) .
tumor absorbed dose exhibited a close correlation between the results from 99mtc - maa spect / ct and 90y - microsphere pet / ct ( r = 0.64 , p < 0.01 ) , although the result from 99mtc - maa spect / ct was significantly lower than that from 90y - microsphere pet / ct ( 135.4 +/ - 64.2 gy vs. 185.0 +/ - 87.8 gy , p < 0.01 ) .
absorbed dose to in - target normal liver was overestimated on 99mtc - maa spect / ct compared with pet / ct ( 62.6 +/ - 38.2 gy vs. 45.2 +/ - 32.0 gy , p = 0.02 ) .
absorbed dose to out - target normal liver did not differ between 99mtc - maa spect / ct and 90y - microsphere pet / ct ( p = 0.49 ) .
patients with tumor absorbed dose > 200 gy on 90y - microsphere pet / ct had longer pfs than those with tumor absorbed dose <= 200 gy ( 286 +/ - 56 days vs. 92 +/ - 20 days , p = 0.046 ) .
tumor absorbed dose calculated by 99mtc - maa spect / ct was not a significant predictor for pfs .
activity planning based on 99mtc - maa scan and spect / ct can be effectively used as a conservative method .
post - sirt dosimetry based on 90y - microsphere pet / ct is an effective method to predict treatment efficacy .
open - accesstrue introduction selective internal radiation therapy ( sirt ) using 90y - microsphere is an effective treatment option for treating inoperable hepatic malignancy .
many studies have reported therapeutic efficacy of 90y - microsphere sirt,1 - 3 with various treatment response rates in hepatocellular carcinoma,4,5 and metastasis from colorectal cancer6 or neuroendocrine tumors.7 because hepatic malignancy is supplied with blood mostly from the hepatic artery,890y - microsphere can be selectively delivered to a target lesion by angiographic intervention. with a half - life of 2.67 days , 90y emits beta - particles with an average energy of 0.927 mev .
the average penetration range of the beta - particles in tissue is 2.5 mm and 90 % of the energy is absorbed within a sphere with a radius of 5.3 mm.9,10 this range is effective to deliver a large absorbed dose to a tumor while minimizing radiation hazard to the normal liver parenchyma , in case selective injection of 90y - microspheres is successful .
most crucial adverse effects in sirt are related to radiation injury of the normal organs .
intrahepatic arterial shunt and consequent leakage of 90y - microsphere to the lungs may cause radiation pneumonitis.11 radiation injury of the normal liver may cause radioembolization - induced liver disease ( reild ) , 12 which exhibits extensive sinusoidal congestion , hepatic atrophy , necrosis , and intimal fibrosis .
to prevent these adverse effects and to determine activity requirement for treatment , planning angiography is performed before sirt , in which 99mtc - macroaggregated albumin ( maa ) is injected into the target artery .
therapeutic efficacy and reild are closely related to the injection activity of 90y - microsphere,12,13 and thus , several methods such as the empirical method , the body surface area ( bsa ) method , and the partition model ( pm ) method have been suggested for activity planning.10,14 among those methods , the pm method based on 99mtc - maa imaging is the most personalized one with a lower incidence of adverse effects,13,15 although some controversy exists regarding distribution equivalency between 99mtc - maa and 90y - resin microsphere.16 recently , single photon emission computed tomography ( spect )/ computed tomography ( ct ) has been widely used in clinical practice , with advantage of correct localization and attenuation correction .
99mtc - maa spect / ct has also been reported to be effective in activity planning for 90y glass microsphere sirt.17 after sirt , the real distribution of 90y - microsphere can be evaluated using bremsstrahlung scan or spect .
additionally , although 90y emits a very small amount of positron ( 0.003 %) , positron emission tomography ( pet )/ ct for 90y is also available with recent pet scanners , which are highly sensitive by adopting time - of - flight ( tof ) algorithms.18 - 20 in this study , we performed activity planning for sirt using 90y - resin microsphere based on 99mtc - maa scan and spect / ct. the appropriateness of the 99mtc - maa imaging - based activity planning was evaluated in comparison with dosimetry by post - sirt 90y - microsphere pet / ct. additionally , the efficacy of pet / ct - based dosimetry was also evaluated in terms of patient outcome .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study applying 90y - microsphere pet / ct to validate 99mtc - maa imaging - based activity planning .
methods patients and study protocol patients who were candidates for sirt were included in this study consecutively .
candidates visited seoul national university hospital , seoul , korea , from june 2012 to august 2014 .
contrast - enhanced ct was performed in every patient for pretreatment evaluation .
sirt was considered for patients with a life expectancy of more than 3 months and a malignant hepatic tumor that was unresectable and inadequate for chemotherapy due to its size .
patients underwent treatment - planning angiography combined with 99mtc - maa injection .
patients with lung shunt fractions ( lsf ) superior to 0.2 were excluded from sirt .
activity of 90y - microsphere was planned based on 99mtc - maa spect / ct. sirt was performed approximately 1 week after planning angiography by the same intervention radiologist .
when injection sites were significantly altered ( changes above major branch of hepatic artery level ) between planning angiography and 90y - microsphere sirt , the patient was excluded from the analysis .
treatment response to sirt was evaluated by the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist ) version 1.1 and progression - free survival ( pfs ) was evaluated .
follow - up contrast - enhanced ct or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) was obtained approximately every 2 months after sirt and when a patient presented abnormal symptoms , signs , or serum tumor marker increase .
planning angiography and 99mtc - maa imaging planning angiography and injection of 99mtc - maa ( 185 mbq ) was performed by 1 interventional radiologist ( h.c.k. ) , according to the previously published guidelines.2199mtc - maa was injected into the supplying arteries split according to the approximate volume ratio of tumor proportion supplied by each artery , in case there were more than 2 tumor - feeding arteries for a tumor .
after the injection of 99mtc - maa , whole body scan and spect / ct were performed using a hybrid scanner combining a dual - head gamma camera and a 16 - slice ct scanner ( discovery nm / ct 670 , ge healthcare , usa ) equipped with low - energy high - resolution collimators .
on whole body scan , conjugate anterior and posterior images were obtained over 10 minutes ( table speed ; 15 cm / minute ) using 256 x 1024 matrices .
spect images were acquired to cover the whole liver and the lower lung , by a step - and - shoot method ( 3degrees intervals ) for 20 seconds per step .
after spect acquisition , a helical ct scan was performed without using contrast agent and images were reconstructed into 3.75 - mm slices .
spect images were reconstructed on 128 x 128 matrices using an iterative algorithm ( 2 iterations , 10 subsets ) , including ct attenuation map - based attenuation correction , resolution recovery , and a postreconstruction butterworth filter with a cut - off frequency 0.48 and order 5 .
selective internal radiation therapy and 90y - microsphere pet / ct the planned activity of 90y - labeled resin microsphere ( sir - spheres , sirtex medical , australia ) was injected through a microcatheter according to the same method as the planning angiography .
injected activity was primarily determined using the pm method , further described below .
however , in some patients with high lsf (> 0.10 ) , activity was determined by the bsa method and reduced by up to 40 % according to the manufacturer 's package insert.22 immediately after completion of sirt , pet / ct images were obtained for 1 bed position including the low chest and the upper abdomen , using a large field - of - view pet / ct scanner ( biograph mct64 , siemens healthcare , germany ) .
ct images were acquired first in a spiral mode ( pitch 1.2 , 120 kvp , and 35 mas ) .
pet images were acquired for 10 minutes using a 3d mode .
ct images were reconstructed using a conventional filtered back projection method , 50 - cm field of view , 3.0 - mm postprocessing thickness and 2.0 - mm increment per slice .
pet images were reconstructed on 200 x 200 matrices using an iterative method including algorithms for point spread function recovery and tof calculation ( 2 iterations , 21 subsets ) with ct - based attenuation correction .
image analysis for activity planning and dosimetry on 99mtc - maa whole body scans , regions of interest ( rois ) were drawn for the lungs and liver , and lsf was calculated by total counts in the lungs ( tclung ) and the liver ( tcliver ) by eq .
( 1 ) for activity planning based on the pm method , 3 partitions were defined in the liver ; tumor , in - target normal liver defined as the non - tumorous liver supplied by the target artery of sirt , and out - target normal liver defined as the non - tumorous liver supplied by nontarget arteries of sirt .
on 99mtc - maa spect / ct images , rois of these 3 partitions were manually drawn on every slice on ct images of fusion spect / ct , with reference to contrast - enhanced ct images ( figure 1 ) using an analysis software package ( xeleris 3 , ge healthcare , usa ) .
volume rendering was done to acquire volumes of interest ( vois ) of the 3 partitions .
figure 1 rois and vois for image analysis .
lsf was measured on anterior and posterior 99mtc - maa planar scans .
rois are drawn on the lungs ( red ) and liver ( yellow ) ( a ). with reference to contrast - enhanced ct images ( b ) , vois for 3 partitions of tumor ( red ) , in - target normal liver ( yellow ) , and out - target normal liver ( blue ) were drawn on 99mtc - maa spect / ct ( c ) and 90y - microsphere pet / ct ( d ) .
mean uptake counts per unit volume in the tumor ( ctm ) , in - target normal liver ( cin ) , and out - target normal liver ( cout ) were measured in the vois , in addition to their volumes ( vtm , vin , and vout ) .
absorbed dose of each partition was basically calculated by eq ( 2 ) .
10,23,24 : where a0 is the initial radioactivity in the partition .
tissue density was assumed to be 1.0 kg / l for the liver and tumor , and 0.3 kg / l25 for the lungs .
for tumor , a0 was calculated by eq. ( 3 ) : a0 for the in - target normal or out - target normal liver was also calculated using the same method .
the activity of 90y - microsphere was planned to meet the tolerance limits of the lungs (< 20 gy ) , and the in - target normal liver (< 70 gy ) , as well as the absorbed dose requirement for tumor treatment (> 120 gy ). 26 in some cases whose volumes of the in - target normal liver were considerably small , tolerance limit of the out - target normal liver (< 30 gy ) was considered instead of that of the in - target normal liver.27 in addition to the pm method , recommended activity of 90y - microsphere was also calculated by using the conventional bsa method,3 for comparison with the results of pm method .
post - sirt 90y - microsphere pet / ct images were analyzed using a vendor - supplied software package ( syngo.via , siemens healthcare , germany ) ( figure 1 ) .
according to the same method as was used for 99mtc - maa spect / ct , vois were drawn for the lungs and 3 partitions in the liver for measuring mean uptake counts and volumes .
because pet / ct images were acquired for only 1 bed position , lung uptake was measured only in the scan - covered basal lungs , and total lung counts were presumed by multiplying lung volume and mean counts of the basal lungs included in pet / ct images .
an average ct - based lung volume measurement value of 3.3 l was used .
absorbed dose to each partition was calculated from the measurements .
statistics paired student t test and chi2 test were used to compare dosimetry parameters between the results from 99mtc - maa imaging and 90y - microsphere pet / ct. correlation between 2 parameters was evaluated using pearson 's correlation coefficient .
for survival analysis , kaplan - meier survival analysis was used and pfs was compared between groups .
in all statistical analyses , a commercial software package ( medcalc , version 12.2.1.0 , medcalc software , belgium ) was used and a p - value less than 0.05 was regarded as significant .
results patient characteristics 90y - microsphere sirt was performed on 30 patients during the study period , among which 7 patients were excluded from the analysis because of major alterations in the injection sites between planning angiography and sirt .
finally , 23 patients ( m : f = 21:2 , age 63.6 +/ - 12.4 years ) were included in the analysis ; 16 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma , 3 patients with cholangiocarcinoma , and 4 patients with metastatic liver mass from other cancers .
patient and tumor characteristics are described in table 1 .
lsf was < 10 % in 19 patients , and 10 - 15 % in 4 patients .
table 1 patient and tumor characteristics according to tumor type activity planning injection activity was determined by pm method in 21 patients , and by bsa method in 2 patients with high lsf .
in all patients , tolerance limits for the lungs were higher than absorbed dose requirement for tumor treatment .
however , tolerance limit for out - target normal liver was slightly lower than absorbed dose requirement in 1 patient , and injection activity was reduced by 14 % .
in 6 patients , the full planned activity was not injected because of arterial flow stasis and reflux ( n = 4 ) or unexpected schedule change ( n = 2 ) .
pfs was able to be evaluated in 22 patients , excluding 1 patient who was missing from follow - up. in activity planning by the pm method , absorbed dose requirement for tumor absorbed dose of 120 gy was calculated as 2.1 +/ - 0.9 gbq ( range 0.8 - 3.8 gbq ) , whereas it was calculated as 1.7 +/ - 0.2 gbq ( range 1.1 - 2.1 gbq ) from the bsa method .
the absorbed dose requirement by the pm method was significantly higher than that by the bsa method ( p = 0.02 ). from the pm method , the tolerance limits for the lungs and out - target normal liver were 31.3 +/ - 32.0 gbq ( range 8.1 - 146.2 gbq ) and 10.5 +/ - 10.2 gbq ( range 1.1 - 42.8 gbq ) , respectively .
sirt and post - sirt dosimetry sirt was performed 9 +/ - 5 days ( range 1 - 15 days ) after 99mtc - maa scan and spect / ct. all except 1 patient underwent sirt more than 48 hours after 99mtc - maa injections to avoid possible embolization effect by maa particles.28 the patient who underwent sirt 1 day after 99mtc - maa injection did not exhibit any flow stasis or reflux during 90y - microsphere injection .
in sirt , 2.3 +/ - 1.2 gbq ( range 0.3 - 3.9 gbq ) of 90y - microsphere was injected. with these actual injected activities , the dosimetry results were calculated by the measurements on 99mtc - maa imaging and 90y - microsphere pet / ct. absorbed dose of each partition is shown in table 2 .
lsf was evaluated to be lower by 90y - microsphere pet / ct than by 99mtc - maa scan ( p < 0.01 ) .
absorbed dose of tumor was calculated lower by 99mtc - maa imaging ( p < 0.01 ) , but absorbed doses of the in - target normal liver ( p = 0.02 ) and the lungs ( p < 0.01 ) by 99mtc - maa imaging were higher than those by 90y - microsphere pet / ct. there was no significant difference in absorbed dose of the out - target normal liver ( p = 0.49 ) .
significant correlations existed between the results by 99mtc - maa imaging and 90y - microsphere pet / ct , in absorbed doses of tumor ( r = 0.64 , p < 0.01 ) , the in - target normal liver ( r = 0.71 , p < 0.001 ) , and the lungs ( r = 0.53 , p < 0.01 ) , but not in absorbed dose of the out - target normal liver ( r = - 0.18 , p = 0.40 ) ( figure 2 ) .

overall pfs of the patients was 207 +/ - 22 days .
when patients were classified by tumor absorbed dose evaluated by 90y - microsphere pet / ct , the groups exhibited a significant difference in pfs .
in patients who had high absorbed dose (> 200 gy , n = 14 ) , pfs was 286 +/ - 56 days ( range 53 - 383 days ) , whereas it was 92 +/ - 20 days ( range 18 - 170 days ) in patients who had low absorbed dose (<= 200 gy , n = 8 ) ( p = 0.046 ; figure 3a ). between these 2 groups , there were no significant differences in other clinicopathologic factors that can affect pfs 29 - 31 ; tumor burden (% , p = 0.16 ) , previous history of chemotherapy ( p = 0.47 ) , previous history of surgery ( p = 0.23 ) , extrahepatic metastases ( p = 0.84 ) , tumor type ( p = 0.13 ) , sex ( p = 0.77 ) , abnormal pre - sirt total bilirubin (> 1.3 mg / dl , p = 0.80 ) , abnormal pre - sirt serum albumin (< 3.5 g / dl , p = 0.69 ) , and poor performance status ( ecog grade > 0 , p = 0.84 ) .
representative cases are shown in figure 4 .

a 37 - year - old male patient with hepatocellular carcinoma presented with a large mass in the left lobe with central necrosis on pre - sirt contrast - enhanced ct ( a ) .
sirt was performed and 2.3 gbq 90y - microsphere was injected through the left hepatic artery .
90y - microsphere pet / ct showed poor delivery of 90y - microsphere to the central portion of the tumor ( b ) .
tumor - absorbed dose was evaluated as 141.3 gy. post - sirt ct showed enlargement of the tumor ( c ) , and pfs was 21 days .
another 55 - year - old male patient with hepatocellular carcinoma presented with a large mass in the right lobe on pre - sirt ct ( d ) .
sirt was performed through the right hepatic artery and 3.1 gbq 90y - microsphere was injected ( e ) .
tumor - absorbed dose was evaluated as 205.0 gy. post - sirt ct showed shrinkage of the tumor ( f ) and pfs was 126 days .
according to tumor absorbed dose evaluated by 99mtc - maa spect / ct , only 3 patients received dose more than 200 gy and statistical analysis was unavailable .
when patients were classified by tumor absorbed dose of 120 gy or 150 gy evaluated by 99mtc - maa spect / ct , the 2 groups did not exhibit a significant difference in pfs ( figure 3b , c ) .
discussion in this study , we demonstrated that activity planning based on 99mtc - maa scan and spect / ct is closely related to post - sirt dosimetry using 90y - microsphere pet / ct , although there was a significant difference in the calculated values between the 2 imaging methods. by spect / ct , tolerance limits for the lung and liver were evaluated to be lower , and the absorbed dose requirement for tumor treatment was evaluated to be higher than by pet / ct , which results in narrower dose margin for activity planning .
thus , 99mtc - maa spect / ct can be used as a conservative activity planning method .
additionally , our study suggests that 90y - microsphere pet / ct is an effective method for post - sirt dosimetry and prediction of treatment efficacy .
in sirt using 90y - microsphere , post - sirt dosimetry and efficacy has often been evaluated using 90y bremsstrahlung scan or spect images.16,32 however , bremsstrahlung x - rays have a low count rate and a wide range of energy ( 50 - 250 kev ) without an energy peak .
thus , the quality of bremsstrahlung imaging is still not satisfactory for accurate quantitative analysis , despite several attempts for optimizing reconstruction algorithm.33,34 recently , pet imaging for 90y has been available with pet scanners of enhanced sensitivity by adopting new reconstruction algorithms such as tof calculation .
although the yield of positron emission from 90y is very low , several previous studies have reported the feasibility of 90y pet imaging and pet - based dosimetry.35,36 the activity distribution and counts on pet images are well correlated with the real activity measured in phantom studies.36,37 in the present study , we obtained 90y - microsphere pet / ct images after sirt and conducted dosimetry using the pm method , while previous studies performed voxel - wise dosimetry.36,38,39 although the pm method does not provide information on heterogeneous dose distribution , it can be easily performed in clinical practice .
additionally , we defined 3 partitions in the liver by differentiating tumor , in - target normal liver , and out - target normal liver .
because radioactivity distribution is different between tumor and normal liver even if they are supplied by the same artery , this 3 - partition model would provide more appropriate dosimetry results than a simple 2 - partition model defining only tumor and normal liver .
in activity planning for 90y - microsphere sirt , simple methods such as empirical and bsa methods have a crucial limitation that individual condition of tumor size or arterial supply is not considered .
pm methods are based on pretreatment 99mtc - maa imaging and can be a practical option for individualized planning .
because 99mtc - maa and 90y resin microspheres theoretically do not redistribute after initial distribution , the effective half - life in a tissue is assumed identical to the physical half - life .
thus , dosimetry can easily be performed from the initial distribution of radioactivity .
recent application of spect / ct enables anatomical localization and more correct dosimetry compared with planar scan .
in the present study , significant differences existed between dosimetry results from pre - sirt 99mtc - maa imaging and post - sirt 90y - microsphere pet / ct , for the lungs , in - target normal liver , and tumor .
despite the correlation , absolute values of the absorbed doses were overestimated for the lungs and in - target normal liver , whereas it was underestimated for the tumor by 99mtc - maa imaging , compared with pet / ct. there have been studies reporting discrepancy between 99mtc - maa and 90y - microsphere imaging.16,32,40 the discrepancy was attributed to differences in particle distribution , caused by different particle features such as size , density , and injected amount.16 it also needs to be considered that catheter location and injection sites can be different between planning angiography and sirt , even if an operator conducts the same procedures .
moreover , image characteristics of spect and pet such as resolution and sensitivity may be other causes for the difference .
on 99mtc - maa scan and spect / ct , there is considerable spill - over effect from tumor to the lungs or adjacent normal liver .
however , in spite of this limitation , 99mtc - maa spect / ct can be an effective tool for activity planning , because tolerance limit and absorbed dose requirement for tumor treatment evaluated on spect / ct may be regarded as relatively conservative values .
additionally , tolerance limit in sirt appears to be different from those in external beam radiation therapy , in which absorbed dose exceeding 30 gy may result in radiation hepatitis.27 in our study , 4 patients received excess radiation to in - target normal liver (> 70 gy ) , 2 patients received excess radiation to out - target normal liver (> 30 gy ) , and 1 patient received excess radiation both to in - target and out - target normal liver .
however , there was no significant hepatic complication or hepatic enzyme elevation in these patients ( data not shown ) .
in sirt , several factors have been suggested as risk factors for reild , including age , tumor type , tumor volume , and delivered activity.12,13 however , tolerance limit for normal liver has been different among different studies,17,26 and no single cutoff value has been used to prevent reild .
further studies are required to determine optimal tolerance limit in 90y - microsphere sirt , based on accurate activity planning and dosimetry .
we adopted 120 gy as the requirement for tumor treatment in planning .
it is based on a previous study,41 in which radioactivity of a tumor was intraoperatively measured on the tissue surface using a beta probe .
however , there is a considerable difference in absorbed doses between the central and peripheral portions of a tumor.36,42 thus , radioactivity measurement on tissue surface using a beta probe may have underestimated the actual absorbed dose .
in another study , tumor absorbed dose of 205 gy in activity planning was suggested as a cutoff value for effective treatment.17 however , although it was reported that dosimetry based on 99mtc - maa spect / ct can be used to predict tumor response and survival in patients receiving 90y - microsphere sirt,17 tumor absorbed dose of 200 gy measured on 90y - microsphere pet / ct was a significant value to predict pfs , whereas tumor - absorbed dose of 120 gy or 150 gy in 99mtc - maa spect / ct - based dosimetry was not in our study .
in spite of significant correlations between tumor - absorbed doses between measurements from 99mtc - maa spect / ct and 90y - microsphere pet / ct , the dosimetry results based on 99mtc - maa spect / ct were not a significant prognostic factor probably due to some patients whose results were discrepant between the 2 imaging methods .
therefore , it is suggested that post - sirt pet / ct scan for 90y - microsphere is necessary for evaluating treatment efficacy and predicting prognosis .
further studies including more patients are required to determine optimal absorbed dose requirement for tumor treatment in 90y - microsphere sirt .
there are several limitations in our study .
first , the study design was not prospective , and the injection sites were not exactly controlled between planning dosimetry and sirt .
although we excluded cases in which injection sites were significantly altered , it can be a considerable limitation to compare the dosimetry between 99mtc - maa spect / ct and 90y - microsphere pet / ct. second , we evaluated pre - sirt lsf on 99mtc - maa planar scan , because it covers whole lung field and is widely used in current clinical practice .
however , attenuation or spill - over effect may have affected the results .
in contrast , post - sirt lsf was evaluated on 90y - microsphere pet / ct that covers only the basal lungs .
the differences in imaging method may have been a cause for the different dose results .
third , the enrolled case number was relatively small , despite statistical significance .
based on the present study , further studies including more cases are required to determine efficacy of post - sirt 90y - microsphere pet / ct and optimal absorbed dose requirement in sirt .
conclusion in this study , we demonstrated that activity planning based on 99mtc - maa spect / ct is closely related to the post - sirt dosimetry based on 90y - microsphere pet / ct , although there were still differences in the calculated doses from the 2 imaging methods .
on spect / ct , the tolerance limit for the lung or liver was lower , and the absorbed dose requirement for tumor treatment was higher than on pet / ct , which results in narrower activity margin for effective and safe sirt .
thus , 99mtc - maa spect / ct can be used as a conservative activity planning method .
additionally , our study suggests that post - sirt 90y - microsphere pet / ct is an effective dosimetry method and can be used to predict treatment efficacy .

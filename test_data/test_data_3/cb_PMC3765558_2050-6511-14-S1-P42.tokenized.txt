diminished sgc expression and activity is associated with the development of endothelial dysfunction and increase in vascular stiffness .
we have previously demonstrated that alternative splicing of sgc transcripts produces sgc splice forms with altered enzymatic and regulatory properties .
however , splicing of sgc genes in human aortic tissue was never investigated .
results we demonstrate that alpha1 and beta1 sgc genes undergo alternative splicing in human aorta .
in normal aortas we detected expression of four different transcripts for alpha1 and beta1 sgc genes , each encoding an alternative protein isoform .
next , we investigated if sgc splicing is altered in vascular disease .
total rna was isolated from samples collected from patients who underwent aortic repair surgery due to damages associated with aortic diseases ( aortic dissection , aortic aneurism or advanced atherosclerosis ) .
age and gender - matched aortic controls from cardiovascular ( cv ) healthy donors obtained from commercial sources ( capital biosciences , md ) were used for comparison .
semi - quantitative rt - pcr analysis with primers specific to individual sgc transcripts demonstrated increased expression of inhibitory alpha1 sgc splice variants ( alpha1 - transcript 6 and alpha1 - transcript 7 , ncbi ) in samples obtained from aortas of patients with descending and ascending aortic aneurisms .
n1 - alpha1 splice isoform , encoded by alpha1 - tr6 , was previously demonstrated to have a dominant - negative phenotype , when co - expressed with canonical alpha1 and beta1 subunits .
in presented study , we characterized the activity of sgc heterodimer containing alpha1 - isoform d ( alpha1 - tr7 ) in cos - 7 cells .
although alpha1 - isoform d formed a heterodimer with beta1 sgc , the resulting enzyme had very low activity and significantly reduced response to major sgc modulators , including no - donors , bay41 - 2272 , hmr1766 and cobinamide .
thus , increased expression of alpha1 - tr7 d should decrease sgc function in human aorta .
on the another hand , expression of oxidation resistant isoform c - alpha1 sgc , encoded by alpha1 - tr5 , was reduced in diseased samples as compared with healthy ones .
the difference was most pronounced between descending aortic aneurism samples and normal controls .
western blot analysis of aortic lysates showed decreased level of 50 kda c - alpha1 protein , confirming that c - alpha1 expression is impaired in diseased samples .
we previously demonstrated that oxidative stress induces the expression of c - a1 sgc in human cancer cells through modulation of splicing .
here , we investigated if similar process occurs in vascular smooth muscle cells ( vsmc ) treated with hydrogen peroxide .
indeed , human aortic vsmc from cardiovascular healthy donor showed induction of c - alpha1 transcript in response to the treatment .
this result allows us to suggest that preferential splicing of c - alpha1 supports sgc activity in oxidative environment and its deregulation contributes to vascular disease .
in addition , q - pcr analysis with commercial assays targeted to the conserved transcripts sequences demonstrated increase in total alpha1 and beta1 sgc mrna .
thus , our data indicate that not changes in transcription , but rather deregulation of splicing of sgc genes , might be a contributing factor to diminished sgc function in diseased aortas .
conclusion our data indicate that alternative splicing is one of the mechanisms regulating sgc function in human aorta and could serve as potential target for new therapeutics .

background twist1 plays a key role in emt - mediated tumor invasion and metastasis .
since bone metastasis is a hallmark of advanced prostate cancer and is detected in at least 85 % of patients who die of this disease , it is of great importance to understand the regulation of the cellular signaling pathways involved in the metastatic process .
methods prostatic cell lines were analyzed using real time rt - pcr , chromatin immunoprecipitations ( chip ) and transfection of sirna 's and reporter constructs .
results we report in this paper that twist1 is an androgen - regulated gene under tight regulation of nkx3 - 1 .
androgens repress the expression of twist1 via nkx3 - 1 , which is a prostate - specific tumor suppressor that is down - regulated in the majority of metastatic prostate tumors .
we show that nkx3 - 1 binds to the twist1 promoter and that nkx3 - 1 over - expression reduces the activity of a twist1 promoter reporter construct , whereas nkx3 - 1 sirna up - regulates endogenous twist1 mrna in prostate cancer cells .
conclusion our finding that nkx3 - 1 represses twist1 expression emphasizes the functional importance of nkx3 - 1 in regulating twist1 expression during prostate cancer progression to metastatic disease .
prostate cancer lncap cells twist1 nkx3 - 1 background metastasis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among men with prostate cancer ( pca ) .
metastasis is a complex multistep process controlled by distinct genes and signaling pathways in each step .
epithelial - meschencymal transition ( emt ) , a critical event for morphogenetic movements during formation of parietal endoderm during gastrulation , may represent the initial phase of metastasis .
furthermore , emt seems to induce stem - like properties of epithelial cells [ 1 ] .
a pivotal step of emt is the loss of e - cadherin [ 2 ] .
twist1 , a master regulator of mesodermal development and a key mediator in the metastatic process , represses the expression of e - cadherin [ 3 ] .
furthermore , twist1 depletion reduces the expression of n - cadherin in pc3 cells , a metastatic prostate cancer cell line , suggesting that twist1 supports emt in prostate cancer [ 4 ] .
in support of this , a positive correlation between the level of twist1 and prostate cancer metastasis has been reported [ 5 ] .
nkx3 - 1 is a critical gene associated with early stage of prostate tumorigenesis as down - regulation of nkx3 - 1 is observed in both prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( pin ) and adenocarsinomas [ 6 ] .
whereas high levels of twist1 is expressed in prostate cancer metastasis , low levels of nkx3 - 1 expression is observed in most prostate cancer metastasis examined [ 7 ] .
nkx3 - 1 encodes a homeobox gene that is switched on during embryonic development of prostate tissue and is one of the earliest markers of luminal prostate epithelium [ 8 ] .
nkx3 - 1 expression is strictly regulated by androgens and also appears to mark a sub - population of prostate stem cells [ 9,10 ] .
we report in this paper that twist1 is a novel androgen - regulated gene whose expression is tightly controlled by nkx3 - 1 .
results twist1 is regulated by androgens the expression of twist1 mrna increased 4 - fold in lncap cells incubated with 0.5 nm r1881 for 72 hours relative to untreated cells ( ctr. ) and reached more than a 10 - fold induction at 10 nm r1881 ( figure 1a ) .
corresponding regulation of twist1 mrna was also demonstrated in rwpe - 1 , a benign prostate cell line ( data not shown ) .
up - regulation of twist1 expression was also observed at the protein level in lncap cells stimulated with increasing concentrations of r1881 ( figure 1b ) .
figure 1 androgen up - regulates twist1 expression.a. lncap cells were stimulated with increasing doses of the synthetic androgen r1881 , and the relative level of twist1 compared to lncap cells left untreated in charcoal stripped fetal calf serum and phenol red free medium ( css ) was quantified using sqrt - pcr .
data are presented as mean +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) relative to unstimulated cells ( control ) .
a paired t - test was performed and a two - tailed p - value < 0,05 is indicated with a *. b. lncap cells were stimulated with increasing doses of the synthetic androgen r1881 or left untreated in css for 3 days before total protein was extracted .
a representative western blot probed with anti human twist1 antibody and anti prkar1a antibody as loading control is shown .
to determine if ar mediates the effect of androgens on twist1 expression , lncap cells were transfected with a sirna targeting ar ( ar ) or a non - silencing sirna as control ( ctr. ) .
down - regulation of ar expression ( figure 2 , lower panel ) reduced the mrna level of twist1 by 80 % relative to control ( figure 2a , upper panel ) supporting the concept that twist1 is an ar target gene in lncap cells .
down - regulation of ar also reduced the level of nkx3 - 1 ( figure 2 , lower panel ) .
figure 2 ar mediates the effect of androgen on twist1 expression .
lncap cells cultured in rpmi medium containing 10 % fcs were transfected with 100 nm of sirna against ar ( ar ) or a non - silencing control ( ctr. ) sirna .
total rna and protein was harvested at 48 h after transfection .
upper panel : twist1 mrna expression was examined using sqrt - pcr .
data are presented as mean +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) relative to the levels of lncap cells transfected with a non - silencing control sirna .
a paired t - test was performed and a two - tailed p value < 0,05 is indicated with a * .
lower panel : representative western blots of twist1 , ar , nkx3 - 1 and alpha - tubulin ( loading control ) are shown .
twist1 is an nkx3 - 1 target gene in an effort to find binding sites for ar ( are ) or androgen - regulated transcription factors , we examined the human twist1 genomic sequence using matinspector [ 11 ] .
three putative binding sites for nkx3 - 1 designated bs1 , bs2 and bs3 ( figure 3a ) were identified .
in addition we observed several potential ares .
chromatin immunopreciptation analyses ( chip ) using chromatin isolated from lncap cells stimulate with 10 nm r1881 (+ r1881 ) for 24 hours or unstimulated cells as control ( - r1881 ) resulted in amplification of bs3 .
we were not able to detect binding to either bs1 or bs2 ( data not shown , n = 3 ) .
a 5 - fold increase in nkx3 - 1 binding activity to the twist1 promoter upon r1881 stimulation was observed ( figure 3b ) .
additionally , pcr amplification of non - targeted dna ( genomic contig of chromosome 12 ) was used as negative control ( data not shown ) .
figure 3 nkx3 - 1 mediates androgen - regulation of twist1. a. three putative nkx3 - 1 - bindingsites ( bs1 , bs2 and bs3 ) are shown as boxes in the twist1 promoter ( from ncbi mapviewer ). b. chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using chromatin isolated from lncap cells stimulate with 10 nm r1881 (+ r1881 ) for 24 hours or left untreated ( - r1881 ) and using a monoclonal antibody against nkx3 - 1 ( nkx3 - 1 ) .
sqpcr results using primers targeting bs3 are shown in b. the results of the bs3 primer set are shown adjusted to the levels of chromatin immunoprecipitated with igg as a negative control .
data are presented as mean +/ - sd ( n = 3 ). c. lncap cells were transfected with pgl3 - twist - luc ( pgl3 - twist ) and a human nkx3 - 1 expression plasmid or an empty vector ( pcr3 ) as well as pcmv beta - gal .
as control , lncap cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid lacking the twist promoter region ( pgl3 ) and the human nkx3 - 1 expression vector or an empty expression plasmid ( pcr3 ) .
the luciferase activities were normalized against the corresponding beta - galactosidase activities and the results are shown as mean +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) .
a paired t - test was performed and a two - tailed p value < 0,05 is indicated with a * d. lncap cells were transfected with 100 nm of sirna targeting nkx3 - 1 or a non - silencing sirna ( ctr. ) and total rna was harvested 72 hours after transfection .
twist1 mrna expression was examined using sqrt - pcr .
the data are shown as mean +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) relative to the levels of lncap cells transfected with a non - silencing control sirna. e. representative western blots showing expression levels of nkx3 - 1 in ( from top ) lncap cells stimulated with 10 nm of r1881 , transfected with nkx3 - 1 overexpression vector or targeted by sirna against nkx3 - 1 .
alpha - tubulin is shown as loading control .
next , a reporter construct containing 5kb of the mouse twist1 promoter ( pgl3 - twist - luc ) was co - transfected with an nkx3 - 1 expression vector .
over - expression of nkx3 - 1 reduced the promoter activity of twist1 by 50 % , indicating that nkx3 - 1 represses the twist1 promoter activity ( figure 3c ) .
no effect of nkx3 - 1 over - expression was observed on cells transfected with pgl3 lacking the twist1 promoter ( pgl3 ) .
finally , the effect of nkx3 - 1 on endogenous twist1 mrna level was studied by transfecting lncap cells with sirna targeting nkx3 - 1 .
a 5 - fold increase in twist1 mrna level was observed when nkx3 - 1 expression was down - regulated ( figure 3d ) .
the impact of r1881 stimulation , nkx3 - 1 overexpression and sirna on nkx3 - 1 expression in lncap cells are summarized in figure 3e .
both r1881 stimulation as well as overexpression of nkx3 - 1 led to a significant increase in nkx3 - 1 expression , while sirna against nkx3 - 1 reduced the expression markedly .
discussion in this study we show both that twist1 mrna is up - regulated by androgen via ar and that nkx3 - 1 , a well - known androgen - regulated gene , binds the upstream regulatory region of the twist1 gene and represses the expression of twist1 .
in a recent study , takayama et al .
[ 12 ] identified putative direct target genes of ar using chip - on chip and cap analysis gene expression ( cage ) .
one of the genes identified by in silico analysis was twist1 .
our results support this report as increased levels of twist1 mrna was observed in r1881 stimulated lncap cells , while reduced expression of twistl was observed in cells transfected with sirna targeting ar. furthermore , our data shows binding of nkx3 - 1 to the promoter region of twist1 .
we therefore suggest that nkx3 - 1 mediates an indirect and late effect of androgen stimulation on twist1 expression .
interestingly , we show that sirna targeting ar reduces the level of twist1 , whereas sirna targeting nkx3 - 1 increases twist1 expression suggesting that twist1 expression is tightly controlled by androgen .
nkx3 - 1 has been shown to function both as an activator and a repressor of transcription , but few target genes have been identified [ 13 - 15 ] .
the physical binding of nkx3 - 1 to the twist1 promoter might block the mesenchymal drive of twist1 , until nkx3 - 1 expression is down - regulated or lost in pin or adenocarcinoma lesions .
loss of nkx3 - 1 expression has been observed in ~ 20 % of pin lesions , ~ 40 % of advanced prostate tumors and up to 80 % of metastatic prostate cancer [ 16 ] .
androgen deprivation therapy as the most widely used treatment for advanced prostate cancer is likely to abolish androgen - stimulation of nkx3 - 1 , leading eventually to down - regulation of repressor protein and de - repression of twist1 's metastatic potential .
in an attempt to identify genes whose regulation are altered by nkx3 - 1 , song et al .
[ 17 ] performed gene expression profiling analyses on micro dissected glands from nkx3 - 1 - deficient prostate tissues during prostate cancer progression .
they observed similarities between the expression profile of the micro dissected glands and constitutive activated akt - transgenic mice as well as pten - deficient mice , suggesting that the pten - akt - nkx3 - 1 axis serve as a major molecular path of prostate tumorigenesis .
li and zhou [ 18 ] showed that activation of the akt pathway by twist1 is critical for the sustention of cancer stem cell - like traits generated by emt , again suggesting a link between loss of nkx3 - 1 expression , relive of twist1 expression and eventually activation of akt pathway .
conclusions we report in this paper that twist1 is an androgen - regulated gene , tightly regulated by nkx3 - 1 .
we show that nkx3 - 1 binds to the twist1 promoter and that nkx3 - 1 over - expression reduces the activity of a twist1 promoter reporter construct , whereas nkx3 - 1 sirna up - regulated endogenous twist1 mrna in prostate cancer cells .
our finding that nkx3 - 1 represses twist1 expression emphasizes the functional importance of nkx3 - 1 in regulating twist1 expression during prostate cancer progression to metastatic disease .

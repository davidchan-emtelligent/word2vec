introduction inadequate knowledge , negative attitudes and risky practices are major hindrances to preventing the spread of hiv .
this study aimed to assess hiv - related knowledge , attitudes and practices ( kaps ) of high school students in lao people 's democratic republic ( pdr ) .
methods a cross - sectional study on unmarried male students aged between 16 and 19 years old was undertaken in 2010 to evaluate their kaps .
we selected 300 eligible grade vii students through systematic random sampling from different high schools in one province of lao pdr .
results the majority of students surveyed were aware that hiv can be transmitted by sexual intercourse ( 97.7 %) , from mother to child ( 88.3 %) and through sharing needles or syringes ( 92.0 %) .
misconceptions about transmission of hiv were observed among 59.3 % to 74.3 % of respondents .
positive attitudes towards hiv / aids were observed among 55.7 % of respondents .
nearly half of the surveyed students ( 45.3 %) said that they would be willing to continue studying in a school with hiv - positive friends , and 124 ( 41.3 %) said they would continue attending a school with hiv - positive teachers .
ninety - four ( 31.3 %) students had a history of sexual intercourse , and 70.2 % of these students had used a condom .
however , only 43.9 % said they used condoms consistently .
students with medium and high levels of knowledge were 4.3 ( 95 % ci = 2.1 - 9.0 , p < 0.001 ) and 13.3 ( 95 % ci = 6.5 - 27.4 , p < 0.001 ) times more likely to display positive attitudes towards people living with hiv .
similarly , safe practices related to safe sex were also observed among students with medium ( or = 2.8 , 95 % ci = 0.9 - 8.8 , p = 0.069 ) and high levels of knowledge ( or = 1.9 , 95 % ci = 0.6 - 6.2 , p = 0.284 ) .
more than three - quarters of students mentioned television and radio as major sources of information on hiv / aids .
conclusions despite adequate knowledge about hiv / aids among the school students , misconceptions about routes of transmission were found .
negative attitudes to hiv / aids and risky practices were also present .
educational programmes with specific interventions are recommended to increase kaps and to prevent new hiv infections among students in lao pdr .
knowledge attitudes practices hiv / aids lao pdr introduction in lao pdr , hiv infection prevalence was estimated to be 0.1 % among the adult population [ 1,2 ] in 2007 , 1.1 % among commercial sex workers ( csws ) [ 3 ] in 2001 , and 5.6 % among men who have sex with men ( msm ) in the vientiane capital [ 4 ] in 2007 .
over time , the number of hiv - positive patients has rapidly increased .
at the end of 2007 , the official cumulative number of hiv - positive cases was 2400 , of which 1523 were known to have developed aids and 775 to have died .
among people living with hiv ( plhiv ) in lao pdr , 58 % were male and aged between 20 and 39 years old , and the major ( 85 %) mode of transmission was heterosexual intercourse [ 1 ] .
the prevalence of hiv infection in the adult population in lao pdr was reported to be low compared to that of neighbouring countries [ 5 ] .
however , there is no room for complacency .
geographical location of the country and several risky behaviours among its population may lead to a further spread of hiv across the country .
lao pdr is a developing country with open borders with countries that have higher hiv prevalence [ 6,7 ] .
immigration of different types of people , especially low - income groups , who come to lao pdr to work in infrastructure development , such as road and dam construction , is very common .
another important issue is internal migration of people .
this includes students who move to cities or urban areas after high school to continue their studies or to work [ 8 ] .
these young people are away from their families for years at a time and very often visit csws for sex .
this increases the possibility of spreading hiv between them , and thereby to the general population [ 9 ] .
although csws in lao pdr are exposed to different activities relating to safe sex practices and are presumed to be well - versed about safe sex issues , very often these sex workers and their male clients engage in unsafe sex , mainly because of the influence of their male clients [ 6 ] .
although people of any age and gender are susceptible to hiv , young people aged 15 to 25 years are more at risk of contracting it. according to the world health organization and the joint united nations program on hiv / aids , youths are much more prone to hiv infection as a result of a lack of correct health information , indulgence in risky behaviours , and lack of access to adequate reproductive health services .
every day 5,000 young people aged between 15 and 25 years in the world become infected with hiv , which translates into almost 2 million new infections per year .
young people face greater challenges and more exposure to risks , including economic exploitation , changing lifestyles , global , regional and national conflicts , and the spread of sexually transmitted infections and hiv / aids [ 10 ] .
any intervention targeted at young men before they are sexually active could prevent new hiv infections .
in this study , we focused only on male students because we believe that hiv - related risky behaviours are more prevalent among males than females .
this is due to men dominance over women during sexual activities .
in lao pdr , women are often hesitant to answer questions related to sexual activity and have comparatively less opportunities to mix with wider society .
socio - economic issues associated with poverty , including limited access to high - quality health care ; the exchange of sex for drugs , money , or to meet other needs ; and higher levels of substance use can directly , or indirectly , increase hiv risk factors among women [ 11 ] .
men play a more active role during sexual activity , and very often it is men who deny protective measures , such as condoms , during sex .
moreover , men often influence women in decisions about safe sex practices .
male - to - male sexual contact is another important issue and has been an important route of hiv - 1 spread since hiv / aids was first identified some 30 years ago [ 12 ] .
reports from thailand , cambodia and senegal suggested an unlinked epidemic pattern between general population hiv rates and those in msm in countries with relatively low and declining hiv prevalence among heterosexual populations , but which have greater than 20 % prevalence of msm [ 13,14 ] .
however , in recent years there has been an increase in hiv infection among the most vulnerable groups , especially msm and migrant workers in lao pdr [ 15 ] .
taking all of these factors into account , we decided to focus on men in order to achieve a greater impact of this study .
increasing knowledge of hiv / aids can be a powerful means of fostering positive attitudes and building safe practices among populations .
hence , a clear understanding about knowledge , attitudes and practices ( kaps ) among any population is very important for planning to control or prevent the spread of hiv .
information about hiv / aids - related kaps has been reported by a number of researchers in different countries .
several studies have been conducted in nigeria and ghana to investigate kap levels among their populations .
these studies found that knowledge about the transmission of hiv was poor in senior high school students in nigeria ( 31 % , 14.4 % , 9.1 % and 8 % of the students studied identified sexual intercourse , blood transfusion , mother to child ( vertical ) transmission and intravenous drug use , respectively ) .
only 7.1 % identified all of the listed four modes of transmission of hiv whilst 0.7 % of the students identified all of the listed preventive methods [ 16 ] .
a survey among adolescents aged between 10 and 19 years in ghana reported sexual abstinence ( 78.1 %) , condom use ( 72.7 %) , fidelity to partner ( 72.5 %) , not sharing needles ( 76.4 %) and reducing sexual partners ( 56.7 %) as important factors in preventing aids [ 17 ] .
nearly half of the participants from the school of pune ( india ) believed that hiv can be contracted from toilet seats [ 18 ] and another study from afghanistan reported that 53.2 % of subjects believed that mosquito bites can transmit hiv [ 18,19 ] .
negative attitudes toward plhiv and sexual behaviours were also reported by another study [ 18 ] .
although hiv / aids - related kaps are reported in studies from other countries , there was no such information for school students in lao pdr .
therefore , this study was conducted among unmarried male high school students of grade vii in the lao pdr to determine their level of kaps regarding hiv / aids .
methods study design , sampling and procedure this cross - sectional study was conducted among grade vii unmarried male students from nine high schools in six districts of lao pdr in september 2010 .
selected districts were chosen purposively from 11 districts in one province with the highest hiv prevalence .
out of a total 6.6 million plhiv in asia and the pacific in 2001 , nearly one million were living in this region .
it has a long border with thailand , which has the highest number of plhiv in the region .
this province also belongs to the lower mekong region where one - sixth of plhiv of asia and the pacific live [ 8 ] .
we selected nine schools out of those six districts with a total of 2400 male students of grade vii .
as there was no existing data on kaps among school students in lao pdr , we calculated the sample size based on the estimate that 50 % of students may have enough knowledge on hiv / aids .
precision was set at 10 % .
for p value 0.05 % and 80 % power of the study , our expected sample size was 196 students .
fearing a high non - respondent rate because of the sensitivity of the issue , our aim was to recruit 300 respondents .
to obtain our desired target of 300 participants , we decided to recruit a set number of students from each school by choosing every 8th student as our final respondent through systematic random sampling .
based on the observation and history from the school records , students who were less than 16 years old and mentally or physically disabled were excluded .
before data collection began , students were briefed about the technical terminologies used in the questionnaire and were given guidance on how to fill out the form .
the researcher to the selected students in the classroom then distributed the self - administered questionnaires during the 45 minutes break of their class .
the students were informed about the purpose of the study and were assured that their responses would be treated confidentially .
respondents were also informed that their participation was entirely voluntary and that they were free to decline to answer any question that made them feel uncomfortable .
written informed consent was obtained from all of the students .
prior permission to conduct this study was obtained from the head master of the involved school .
moreover , this study was approved by the national ethics committee for health research ( nechr ) , ministry of health , lao pdr .
questionnaire the aim of the questionnaire was to obtain information on the level of hiv / aids - related kaps of the respondents , as well as their sources of information on the issue .
the questionnaire was developed by the researchers after consulting with experts in the relevant field .
we also reviewed the questionnaire developed by the global school - based health survey for south asian countries and family health international 's questionnaire on hiv / aids prevention in developing countries during the questionnaire development [ 8,20 ] .
our final questionnaire included questions relating to hiv knowledge , attitudes toward plhiv and sexual practices , in addition to socio - demographic information .
the questionnaire was divided into four parts .
part i focused on the socio - demographic characteristics of the respondents , including age , ethnic groups , residence , and religion and their sources of information about hiv / aids .
part ii contained 21 knowledge - related items , which again were subdivided into two sections , with questions relating to transmission , and prevention and control of hiv / aids .
we included both positively and negatively framed questions to assess their knowledge , as well as their misperceptions , about hiv / aids .
part iii comprised 18 questions on attitudes towards plhiv , which again included both positively and negatively framed questions .
finally , part iv comprised 12 questions about practices related to hiv / aids , including sexual behaviour and daily activities .
before data collection began , the questionnaire was piloted with 10 students , testing for clarity , feasibility and appropriateness for the students .
the questionnaire was developed in english , then translated into lao language before data collection and finally translated back into english .
statistical analyses data were entered into a spreadsheet and exported to statistical package for the social science ( r ) ( spss ) for windows , version 18.0 software ( spss inc. , illinois , usa ) for analysis .
descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic characteristics and kaps about hiv / aids .
numbers and percentages were used to present categorical data .
mean (+/ - standard deviation , sd ) was used for normally distributed continuous data , and median ( interquartile range , iqr ) for non - normal continuous data .
odds ratios ( ors ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) were calculated though a logistic regression model to determine association levels of knowledge with attitudes and practices .
all tests were two - tailed , and p < 0.05 was considered significant .
to evaluate knowledge and attitude of the respondents , we asked them to answer " yes " , " no " or " do not know " to every knowledge - and attitude - related question .
for practices , options were only " yes " or " no " .
we assigned a score of 1 for a correct answer and 0 for a wrong answer for knowledge - and practice - related questions , and 1 for every positive answer in the attitude section and 0 for negative answers .
the scores were then summed up to generate an overall score for each participant .
levels of kaps were then re - categorized depending on their total , mean and median score .
accordingly , level of knowledge was categorized into " low " for respondents scored <= 50 % , " moderate " for those scored between 51 and 74 % , and " high " for those who scored >= 75 % [ 17 ] .
the scores of attitudes and practices were categorized into two segments based on their mean and median score : those scoring less than mean scores for attitude were classified as " negative " and those scoring equal and more than mean scores were classified as " positive " attitudes .
as data for practice was not normally distributed , we used median as the cut - off .
accordingly , those scoring less than median scores for practice were classified as " risky " practices , and those scoring equal and more than median scores were classified as " safe " practices .
results socio - demographic characteristics the mean age of the 300 participants was 17.9 years ( sd +/ - 0.9 ) , ranging from 16 to 19 years .
overall , 243 ( 81.0 %) of the respondents were laolum , and the majority ( 81.3 %) were buddhist .
a high number of respondents were from district i ( 26.3 %) , and only 22 ( 7.3 %) were from district vi ( table 1 ) .
all participants were living with parents and siblings .

overall , the knowledge about route of transmission of hiv was high for some factors and relatively low for other factors .
accordingly , 97.7 % of respondents knew that hiv can be transmitted through sexual intercourse .
the majority of students were also aware that hiv can be transmitted through sharing needles or syringes , from mother to child and through blood transfusions .
however , there was confusion about some routes of transmission .
for example , only 61.0 % of the participants correctly answered that " shaking hands " with plhiv does not spread hiv .
there was confusion about routes of transmission e.g. nearly half of respondents incorrectly thought that hiv could be transmitted by eating from the same plate , drinking from the same glass , wearing the same clothes and sharing the same toilet with plhiv .
only a quarter of the respondents correctly answered that mosquitos do not transmit hiv .
table 2 knowledge regarding transmission and prevention of hiv / aids ( n = 300 ) questions with correct response number (%) reporting the correct responses knowledge about route of transmission hiv can be transmitted by sexual intercourse ( yes ) 293 ( 97.7 ) hiv can be transmitted from mother to child ( yes ) 265 ( 88.3 ) hiv can be transmitted by sharing needle or syringe ( yes ) 276 ( 92.0 ) hiv can be transmitted by blood transfusion ( yes ) 222 ( 74.0 ) hiv can be transmitted by shaking hand ( no ) 183 ( 61.0 ) hiv can be transmitted by eating and drinking from the same plate or glass of an hiv - positive person ( no ) 178 ( 59.3 ) hiv can be transmitted by wearing the same clothes of an hiv - positive person ( no ) 167 ( 55.7 ) hiv can be transmitted by sharing a toilet with an hiv - positive person ( no ) 152 ( 50.7 ) hiv can be transmitted through a mosquito bite ( no ) 77 ( 25.7 ) knowledge about prevention and control hiv can be prevented by not sharing needle or syringe ( yes ) 274 ( 91.3 ) hiv can be prevented by properly using condom during sexual intercourse ( yes ) 268 ( 89.3 ) hiv transmission can be avoided by remaining faithful to a single partner ( yes ) 242 ( 80.7 ) hiv transmission can be avoided by a blood test before marriage ( yes ) 157 ( 52.3 ) table 2 also summarizes the knowledge of the students about prevention of hiv .
a satisfactorily high level of knowledge was reported by students when they were asked questions such as : can hiv be prevented by not sharing needle or syringe ?
can using condoms during sexual intercourse protect against hiv infection ?
can hiv be controlled by sticking to a single partner ?
however , in response to the question whether " hiv can be controlled by having a blood test before marriage " only 157 ( 52.3 %) replied " yes " .
overall , respondents had a mean (+/ - sd ) score of knowledge of 13.6 (+/ - 3.6 ) from 21 knowledge - related questions .
accordingly , 46.3 % were classified as having a high level of knowledge with a knowledge score of >= 75 % , 31.3 % as medium level of knowledge with 51 % to 74 % score and 22.4 % as low level of knowledge with <= 50 % score of knowledge regarding hiv / aids [ 17 ] .
attitudes toward plhiv overall attitudes of the high school students are illustrated in table 3 .
the students exhibited positive attitudes to taking care of their hiv - positive relatives if they were ill and continuing friendships with hiv - positive friends .
however , less than half of the students showed positive attitudes on issues such as : buying items from a hiv - positive shopkeeper or food seller ; if an hiv - positive student should be allowed to continue her / his studying in school and if an hiv - positive teacher should be allowed to continue her / his teaching in school. of the 18 questions that addressed attitudes toward plhiv , the scores ranged from 3 to 18 ( mean score = 12.4 , sd +/ - 3.3 ) .
accordingly , 55.7 % of students scored equal or more than the mean and were classified as having a positive attitude towards plhiv .
a total of 44.3 % were classified as having a negative attitude toward plhiv because they scored less than the mean .

( yes ) 136 ( 45.3 ) if a teacher is hiv positive , she / he should be allowed to continue his / her teaching in school ?
( yes ) 124 ( 41.3 ) practices related to hiv / aids table 4 demonstrates that 94 ( 31.3 %) of the school students had a history of sexual intercourse .
the mean age (+/ - sd ) of their first sexual experience was 16.8 (+/ - 1.1 ) years with an age range of 14 to 19 years. of these respondents , 14 ( 14.9 %) had experience of sex with men in the form of oral , anal or both .
sixty - six ( 70.2 %) students said they were using condoms during sex , only 29 ( 43.9 %) were using condoms regularly when they had sex with casual partners and 35 ( 53.0 %) used a condom during their most recent experience of sexual intercourse .
a total of 56.4 % of the school students reported safe practices , having an equal or greater than median score of 5.0 , ( iqr , 2.0 - 9.0 ) from 12 questions on safe sexual practices to prevent hiv / aids , and 43.6 % were having risky practice , with less than the median score .

d or = odds ratio .
e ci = confidence interval .
more than half ( 61.3 %) of the respondents said that their most common source of information was the television , followed by the radio ( 25.3 %) .
less than one - fifth of the respondents were aware about hiv / aids from friends ( 7.7 %) , brochures ( 3.7 %) , newspapers ( 1.3 %) and magazines ( 0.7 %) .
discussion this is the first study on hiv / aids - related kaps among high school students in lao pdr .
this study reports an average - level of kaps relating to hiv / aids .
however , misconceptions about the routes of transmission of hiv / aids remain .
in addition , only just over half of the students showed positive attitudes towards plhiv .
around a third of the students reported prior sexual experience including with a male partner .
almost all survey respondents knew about hiv / aids and could correctly answer questions on hiv transmission and prevention , which indicates that students had a good basic awareness of the issue .
respondents also did moderately well in answering questions relating to the main routes of hiv transmission .
similar findings have also been reported in studies done in afghanistan , kazakhstan , pakistan and china [ 19,21 - 23 ] .
however , there was a lack of understanding about some important points of transmission of hiv , such as the belief that hiv can be transmitted by mosquito bites , along with shaking hands , sharing clothes , toilets and utensils with plhiv .
this indicates that students need more information and education about some points of routes of transmission .
again , similar misconceptions have been reported in other studies [ 19,22,23 ] .
the majority of students knew that the use of condoms during sexual intercourse could prevent hiv .
similar findings were reported by previous studies conducted amongst afghan university students [ 19 ] , turkish high school students [ 22 ] and chinese undergraduate students [ 23 ] where almost half of the respondents were male .
students exhibited mixed reactions to plhiv .
whilst they displayed positive attitudes on most of the issues , they were reluctant to see an hiv - positive teacher continue to teach .
this finding is not unique for lao adolescents .
similar results were reported in several studies conducted in ghana , china , turkey and iran [ 17,22 - 24 ] .
the iranian study , which was conducted in 2002 among 4641 second - grade high school students , reported that about half of the respondents ( 33 % - 46 %) disagreed with plhiv being able to enter schools , and said that they would not want to sit near plhiv , or to shake hands with them .
however , nearly half of the respondents also said they were eager to show compassion towards plhiv [ 24 ] .
this may be because students are empathetic toward plhiv .
however , they still fear that having close contact with them might put them at risk of contracting hiv .
this is illustrated by a reported willingness to maintain a friendship or to be taught by plhiv but not wanting to sit with them in the classroom .
they might also believe that hiv is transmissible through items bought from an hiv - positive shopkeeper [ 19 ] .
these attitudes are important to consider when developing strategies to respond to hiv .
discriminating attitudes to plhiv might be an obstacle for the efficient propagation of awareness programmes [ 19 ] , and voluntary counselling and testing for hiv .
lao pdr has initiated a national strategic and action plan on hiv / aids / sti for 2006 to 2010 , which includes comprehensive guidance on efforts to respond to hiv and aids in the country .
it identifies at - risk groups and corresponding strategies for targeted prevention ; outlines strategies to enhance care and support for plhiv ; spells out policy , legal reform and advocacy measures ; identifies measures to strengthen the capacity for surveillance and research ; and outlines strategies for effective program management .
this plan should carefully examine and include attitude issues with due importance .
many barriers , such as stigma and discriminatory attitudes [ 19 ] , also need to be reduced .
plhiv should be equally respected and valued in the society .
the lao buddhist monks have been working to reduce social stigma towards plhiv through their sermons , teaching in schools and being examples by providing spiritual care to plhiv [ 25 ] .
adolescents need targeted counselling about safe practices by avoiding , for example , unprotected sexual relationships and exchange of syringes / needles .
risky sexual practices were also highlighted as another barrier for hiv prevention .
one - third of high school students had a history of sexual intercourse , similar to the findings from other reports [ 21,23,26,27 ] , and their first sexual contact was at 16 years of age [ 2,21,26,28 - 30 ] .
nearly 15 % of surveyed student with sexual experiences said they had engaged in sex with men .
this is an interesting finding in the conservative and religious lao culture .
religion has a strong influence on personal as well as societal behaviour and practices of lao people .
premarital and extramarital sex , as well as homosexuality , are discouraged by religious faiths in this population .
religious issues were also considered important and included in hiv / aids activities carried out by unicef in lao pdr [ 7 ] .
however , lao pdr is also one among many countries that are trying to acknowledge these sexual behaviours in their governmental response .
same - sex relationships have been legalized by the lao government , which has enacted a special law .
male - to - male sex stigma is gradually decreasing , although it is not socially accepted yet [ 31 ] .
this issue is still beyond the observation of many concerned authorities dealing with hiv / aids .
our results might offer important insights for them and stimulate necessary measures to be taken to prevent hiv transmission .
adolescents should be the focus of hiv / aids - related activities because this is the age when they become sexually active and are accessible through in - school education .
accurate hiv knowledge will support adolescents in making informed choices about their practices that may protect them from hiv transmission .
lao pdr is planning to introduce healthy living curricula for primary and middle school students and to incorporate this into the national school curriculum [ 8 ] .
at present , various health educational programs are in effect at community - level including peer educator training .
sexual education in schools needs to be implemented soon .
we found that less than half of the participants were using condoms consistently during sexual intercourse .
this was consistent with other surveys in previous years [ 19,27,30 ] .
in lao culture , young and unmarried people buying condoms can be a sensitive issue .
adolescents might be embarrassed about buying condoms from shopkeepers out of fear that the shopkeepers might inform their guardians .
although condoms are widely available in pharmacies , hotels , nightclubs and guest houses and are cheap to buy , affordability might still be a factor behind its inconsistent use by some young people .
these findings were supported by a study , which identified unavailability of condoms as a major barrier to hiv prevention ; only 34.2 % of respondents said that they have access to condoms [ 19 ] .
some students said they were not comfortable using condoms during sex because they felt it might reduce their sexual pleasure .
these misconceptions may increase the likelihood of hiv spread .
there were several limitations to the study .
first , we restricted this study to only one province and did not include out - of - school adolescents .
this limits the generalizability of the study findings to other provinces and to all adolescents of similar age .
second , whilst hiv knowledge is important , it may not be the primary factor in explaining hiv transmission among young people .
many people have adequate knowledge about hiv but do not act on it due to a wide variety of social , cultural and economic constraints .
future studies that investigate of all these possible constraints could help to improve our understanding of hiv transmission .
third , we used a three - point scale to assess attitudes that may not reflect respondents' views with adequate precision .
a five - point scale is usually a better choice in this case .
however , fearing the ability of the school students to think in such wider scale , we hesitated to use a five - point scale .
finally , because of the self - administered questionnaire , social desirability bias may have occurred .
however , the anonymity of the questionnaires hopefully encouraged students to be honest in their responses .
despite all of these limitations , we believe this study might be a reasonable source of information for researchers and policymakers .
conclusions in conclusion , the surveyed high school students had moderate kaps about hiv / aids .
the study highlighted some misconceptions about hiv transmission , intolerant attitudes , stigma and discrimination towards plhiv , and risky sexual practices , which need to be addressed .
hiv / aids - related education programmes should include specific interventions to change practices , along with knowledge and attitudes .
future research involving nationally representative samples for both male and female , school - attending and out - of - school adolescents could contribute substantially to hiv / aids prevention .

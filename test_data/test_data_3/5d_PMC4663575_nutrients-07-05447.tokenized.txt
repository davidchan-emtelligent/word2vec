anti - diabetic effects on the metabolomic differences between green tea ( gt ) and aquilariae lignum - fermented green tea ( fgt ) were investigated in the high fat - fed mouse .
to prove the differences , hypoglycemic ( blood glucose , insulin and glycated hemoglobin levels , pancreas weights and histopathological - immunohistochemistrical analysis of pancreas - insulin / glucagon cells ) , hepato - and nephron - protective ( the changes in liver and kidney weight , histopathology of liver and kidney , serum aminotransferases ( ast and alt ) levels , blood urea nitrogen , and serum creatinine levels ) , and hypolipidemic ( the changes of serum total cholesterol , triglyceride , low - and high - density lipoprotein levels with fecal tc and tg contents ) effects were evaluated .
in addition , liver lipid peroxidation , the glutathione contents , and catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were measured according to the hepatic glucose - regulating enzyme activities of glucokinase ( gk ) , glucose - 6 - phosphatase ( g6pase ) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( pepck ) for action mechanisms .
as a result , fgt showed a stronger hypoglycemic , hepato - and nephron - protective , hypolipidemic , and anti - oxidant effect than gt in high fat - fed mice .
in addition , fgt - treated mice exerted more favorable inhibitory activities against gk , g6pase , perck activities as compared to gt - treated mice .
taken together , fgt fermented with aquilariae lignum , 1:49 ( 2 % ; g / g ) has a stronger effect compared with gt. therefore , fgt has the potential to increase bioactivity against type 2 diabetics .
high fat diet mouse obese diabetes aquilariae lignum fermented green tea metformin simvastatin hepatic glucose - regulating enzyme 1 .
introduction obesity contributes to the etiologies of a variety of comorbid conditions , such as cardiovascular disease , hypertension , and type ii diabetes [ 1 ] .
in addition to storing lipid for energy , adipose secretes a variety of adipokines , many of which affect metabolism and inflammation in adipose and non - adipose tissues .
modulation of the endocrine functions of adipose tissue can contribute to a chronic state of inflammation , which leads to the pathogenesis of associated disorders , specifically insulin resistance [ 2 ] .
one of the critical determinants for the development of this obesity may be an increase in the regional distribution of body fat , i.e. , abdominal obesity .
the latter often shows clustering of atherogenic risk factors [ 3 ] , i.e. , hypertension , dyslipidemia , alterations in coagulation and inflammatory cytokine profiles , and hyperinsulinemic insulin resistance .
as a consequence , there is an expected increase in morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease [ 4 ] .
currently available pharmacological agents for metabolic syndrome , however , have a number of limitations , such as various adverse effects and high rates of secondary failure [ 5 ] .
due to these factors , metabolic syndrome patients and healthcare professionals are increasingly considering complementary and alternative approaches .
since control of postprandial hyperglycemia and inhibition of oxidative stress are suggested to be important in the treatment of diabetes [ 6 ] , many efforts had been made to search for effective and safe alpha - glucosidase inhibitors and antioxidants from natural materials to develop a physiological functional food or lead compounds for curing diabetes [ 7,8 ] .
among them , metformin is an oral antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class .
it is the first - line drug of choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , in particular , in overweight and obese people and those with normal kidney function [ 9 ] .
it is the only antidiabetic drug that has been conclusively shown to prevent the cardiovascular complications of diabetes , and also metformin has been shown to have regulatory effects on pancreatic zymogen release [ 10 ] and hepatic glucose - regulating enzyme activities [ 11,12 ] .
in recent years , fermented herbs have been highlighted as a new source of medicinal ingredients or pharmaceutics , because the bioactivity of natural herbs is increased by various fermentation techniques through their biotransformation or probiotic effects [ 10,13,14,15 ] .
moreover , fermentation of herbs using a variety of edible microorganisms seems to further enhance the pharmacological efficacy of parent herbs [ 10,13,14,15 ] .
tea ( camellia sinensis l. ) is the second most consumed beverage in the world next to water .
tea was found to demonstrate bioactivities including antioxidant activities [ 16 ] , improved immune response [ 17 ] , and anti - atherosclerosis [ 18 ] , antihypertension [ 19 ] , anti - infectious diseases [ 20 ] , and antidiabetic properties [ 21 ] .
the chemical compositions of the tea in different forms were different and induced the change in bioactivities [ 6,22 ] .
aquilariae lignum is the stem part of aquilaria agallocha roxb ( thymelaceae ) and contains essential oils .
the chemical composition of aquilariae lignum includes benzylacetone , p - methoxybenzylacetone , hydrocinnamic acid , agarospirol , agarofuran and dihydroagarofuran [ 23,24 ] .
aquilariae lignum has been traditionally used in aroma - therapeutics for various purposes , and anti - allergic [ 25 ] , analgesic [ 26 ] and anxiolytic [ 27 ] effects have been reported .
in our previous study [ 10 ] , aqueous extracts of fermented green tea with aquilariae lignum ( fgt ) effectively inhibit diabetes and related complications - - diabetic hyperlipidemia , hepatopathies , nephropathies and obesity in db / db mice - - more favorably than those of aqueous green tea extract ( gt ) .
excessive intake of fatty acids leads to an accumulation of triglyceride in many tissues , particularly in the fat tissue , in which lipolysis is increased .
the increased circulation of fatty acids , associated with rising lipolysis in adipocytes with insulin resistance , results in a plethora of fatty acids to non - adipose tissues , such as muscle , pancreas and liver .
in individuals with insulin resistance , increased levels of tissue fatty acid - binding and transport proteins in adipose and non - adipose tissues facilitate the uptake processes .
the exaggerated availability of free fatty acid ( ffa ) and deposition in muscle induces a negative loop in insulin - mediated muscle insulin signaling and glucose utilization .
in the pancreas , prolonged exposure to ffa might cause impairment of insulin release through the mechanism of lipotoxicity [ 28 ] .
in the liver , high ffa concentration contribute to resistance to the action of insulin by enhancing glucose output from liver [ 29 ] .
the accumulation of triglyceride in liver by high fatty acids also brings about non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) .
nafld does damage to liver , which is the main organ of glucose metabolism , such as steatosis , steatohepatitis , and hepatocellular necrosis to fibrosis [ 30 ] .
the balance between hepatic lipogenesis and lipolysis is important for improving insulin resistance and nafld .
these are generally characteristic features of metabolic syndrome [ 31 ] .
in this study , we intended to confirm or observe the real pharmacological activities of fgt in mild diabetic obese mice and high fat diet ( hfd ; 45 kcal % fat ) supplied mice [ 14,32,33,34 ] as compared with parent gt. metformin , a representative anti - diabetic drug for type ii diabetes [ 35,36 ] , at a dose level of 250 mg / kg [ 10,14,15 ] , and simvastatin , a lipid lowering medication [ 37,38 ] which has been used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease in diabetes [ 39,40 ] at a dose level of 10 mg / kg [ 14,15 ] , were used as potent reference drugs .
2. experimental section 2.1 .
animals and husbandry female spf / vaf crljori : cd1 [ icr ] mice ( 6 weeks old upon receipt ; orientbio , seungnam , korea ) were used after acclimatization for 7 days .
four to five animals were placed in each polycarbonate cage in a temperature ( 20 degreesc - 25 degreesc ) and humidity ( 40 % - 45 %) controlled room .
light : dark cycle was 12 h : 12 h , and standard rodent chow ( samyang , seoul , korea ) and water were supplied as free to access .
animals adapted to hfd were selected after a 1 - week adaption period as eight groups ( eight mice in each groups ) based on the body weights .
all laboratory animals were treated according to the national regulations of the usage and welfare of laboratory animals , and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee in daegu haany university ( gyeongsan , gyeongbuk , korea ) prior to animal experiment ( approval no. dhu2014 - 066 ) .

preparation and administration of test substances light brown solution of fgt and greenish brown solution of gt were prepared by chuiwoon hyangdang ( seongju , korea ) according to our previous study [ 10 ] .
the process for making fgt was as follows : briefly , mixtures of dried green tea leaves and aquilariae lignum powder ( 49:1 , g / g ) were wet - fermented for 12 h at 60 degreesc , and then steamed for 30 s at 100 degreesc after being dried for 1 week at 15 degreesc .
the steamed mixtures were cooled and additionally dried at 15 degreesc for 3 days .
each of fgt or dried gt ( 28 g ) were boiled at 100 degreesc for 6 h and then cooled for an additional 6 h in 1 l of pure water , respectively .
aqueous solutions were completely lyophilized ( operon fdb - 5503 , kimpo , korea ) .
total 5.40 g of fgt ( yield = 19.29 %) and 7.28 g of gt ( yield = 26.00 %) were acquired , and used in this study .
lyophilized fgt and gt aqueous extracts were stored at - 20 degreesc in a refrigerator to protect them from light and humidity until used .
metformin hydrochloride ( wako pure chemical , osaka , japan ) and simvastatin ( bicon limited , bamgalore , india ) were used as reference recommendation drugs .
each of fgt 400 , 200 and 100 mg / kg , simvastatin 10 mg / kg , metformin 250 mg / kg or gt 400 mg / kg were orally administered , dissolved in distilled water , once a day for 84 days from 14 days of acclimatization in a volume of 10 ml / kg , respectively .
in intact vehicle and hfd control mice , equal volumes of distilled water were also orally administered , instead of test substances , respectively .
the dosages of gt ( 400 mg / kg ) and fgt ( 400 , 200 and 100 mg / kg ) were selected based on our previous experiment in db / db mice [ 10 ] , respectively .
the dose levels of metformin , 250 mg / kg [ 10,14,15 ] and simvastatin 10 mg / kg [ 14,15 ] were also selected as per our previous animal studies , respectively .
2.3 .
hfd supply animals were supplied hfd ( research diet , new brunswick , nj , usa ) free to access listed in table 1 after 7 days of acclimatization .
in intact control , normal pellet diets ( superfeed co. , wonju , korea ) were supplied as free to access instead of hfd .
2.4 .
changes in body weight changes in body weight were measured at 8 days ( immediately before start of hfd supply ) and 1 day before initiation of administration , and at initial administration day , and then weekly until termination using an automatic electronic balance ( precisa instrument , dietikon , switzerland ) .
at initiation of administration and at termination , all experimental animals were overnight fasted ( but not for water ; about 12 h ) to reduce the differences from feeding .
in addition , body weight gains were additionally calculated during adaption and administration periods , using the following equation : during adaption periods ( 7 days ; from day - 8 to day 0 of test article - administration ) = ( body weights at initiation of administration - body weights at initiation of hfd supply ) ; during administration periods ( 84 days ; from day 0 to day 84 of test article administration ) = ( body weight at a termination - body weight at initiation of administration ) .

effects on obesity 3.1.1 .
effects on the body weight changes hfd control mice showed significant ( p < 0.01 ) increases in body weight as compared with intact mice from 1 week after hfd supply ( arrow ) , and accordingly , the body weight gains during 7 days of hfd adaption and 84 days of administration were also significantly ( p < 0.01 ) larger as compared with the intact control .
however , significant ( p < 0.01 or p < 0.05 ) decreases of the body weights were detected in simvastatin 10 mg / kg , metformin 250 mg / kg , gt 400 mg / kg , fgt 400 , 200 and 100 mg / kg treated mice from 14 to 35 days after start of administration as compared with hfd control ( dot arrows ) , and accordingly , the body weight gains during 84 days of administration were also significantly ( p < 0.01 ) lower in these groups as compared with hfd control , respectively .
especially , fgt 400 , 200 and 100 mg / kg treated hfd mice also showed significant ( p < 0.01 or p < 0.05 ) decreases of body weight from 63 , 56 and 77 days after initial test substance administrations ( arrowheads ) , and they also showed significantly ( p < 0.01 ) lower body weight gains during the 84 days of continuous oral administration as compared with gt 400 mg / kg treated mice , respectively ( figure 1 , table 2 ) .
the body weight gains during 84 days of administration in hfd control changed by 351 percentage points as compared with intact control , by - 72 % , - 60 % , - 46 % , - 71 % , - 68 % and - 63 % in simvastatin 10 mg / kg , metformin 250 mg / kg , gt 400 mg / kg , fgt 400 , 200 and 100 mg / kg treated mice as compared with hfd control , respectively .
3.1.2 .
effects on food consumption and energy intake although significant ( p < 0.01 ) decreases of mean daily food consumptions were detected in all hfd supplied mice as compared with intact control , no meaningful or significant changes on the mean daily food consumptions and the mean daily energy intakes were detected in all test substance administered groups including simvastatin 10 mg / kg as compared with hfd control , in this study .
energy intake per body weight was significantly decreased in groups of hfd control , metformin and gt 400 mg / kg , comparing to intact control .
the decreases were related with increased body weights , but not with actual energy changes .
similarly , considering that there were significant decreases in the body weight gain in fgt 400 mg / kg treated group compared with hfd control , body weight gain was significantly decreased and there were no differences in daily food intake .
( table 2 ) .
the mean daily food consumptions during 84 days of administration periods in hfd control were changed as - 21 % point as compared with intact control , but they were changed as 2 % , - 0 % , 3 % , 4 % , 5 % and 4 % point in simvastatin 10 mg / kg , metformin 250 mg / kg , gt 400 mg / kg , fgt 400 , 200 and 100 mg / kg treated mice as compared with hfd control , respectively .
the mean daily energy intake per body weight during 84 days of administration periods in hfd control were changed as - 32 % point as compared with intact control , but they were changed as 26 % , 19 % , 20 % , 25 % , 32 % and 21 % point in simvastatin 10 mg / kg , metformin 250 mg / kg , gt 400 mg / kg , fgt 400 , 200 and 100 mg / kg treated mice as compared with hfd control , respectively .

4. discussion diabetes mellitus is one of the primary threats to human health due to its increasing prevalence , chronic course , and disabling complications [ 6 ] .
since control of postprandial hyperglycemia and inhibition of oxidative stress are suggested to be important in the treatment of diabetes [ 6,10 ] , many efforts had been made to search for effective and safe alpha - glucosidase inhibitors and antioxidants from natural materials to develop a physiological functional food or lead compounds for curing diabetes [ 7,8,10,14,15 ] .
in our previous study [ 10 ] , fgt also effectively inhibits diabetes and related complications - - including diabetic hyperlipidemia , hepatopathies , nephropathies and obesities in db / db mice - - more favorably than those of gt. in the present study , therefore , we intended to confirm or observe the real pharmacological activities of fgt in mildly diabetic obese mice , the hfd supplied mice [ 14,32,33,34 ] as compared with parent gt. the increases of body mass and weights were meaningfully and dose - dependently inhibited by treatment of fgt and also by simvastatin , metformin and gt , respectively .
the accumulation or increases of fat deposition in the body are major characteristics of obesity , and cellular hypertrophy appeared to be the major mode of expansion of the intra - abdominal adipose tissue in rodents [ 10,14,15 ] .
in obesity , the increases in the accumulation of adipose tissues are common features in obesity .
adipose tissue is currently known to work not simply as an organ for energy storage , but also as an endocrine and secretory organ [ 56 ] .
adipose tissues secrete adipokines , and changes in the expression , secretion , and action of the adipokines in obesity are possibly implicated in the development of various diseases including insulin resistance [ 10,57 ] .
in this study , treatment of fgt significantly inhibited the accumulation of adipose tissues and adipocyte hypertrophy , and especially , all three different dosages of fgt treated hfd mice also showed significant and more favorable inhibitory effects on adipose tissue accumulation and adipocyte hypertrophy as compared with those of gt. the decreases of mean daily food consumption detected in all hfd supplied mice as compared with nfd supplied intact mice were not considered as critical problems in this study because the energy intake of hfd ( 4.73 kcal / g ) used in the present study was much higher than that of normal diet ( 0.21 kcal / g ) .
similar decreases of daily food consumption in hfd supplied mice were already reported in our previous studies [ 10,15 ] .
no meaningful or significant changes in the mean daily food consumptions were detected in all test substance administered groups as compared with hfd control , suggesting pharmacological effects of test substances detected in this study were difficult to associate with the inhibition of food consumption .
it is generally known that obesity causes pancreatic steatosis , acinar cell atrophy , and a diminution in the number of zymogen granules [ 10,58 ] .
the increases of zymogen granules in exocrine pancreatic acinar cells mean the production of digestive enzymes , especially for digestion of lipid and protein [ 59 ] .
the diminishment of zymogen depositions in exocrine pancreas was effectively and dose - dependently inhibited by treatment of fgt and also by metformin but not in simvastatin .
these results suggest that fermentation with appropriated amounts of aquilariae lignum , 1:49 ( 2 % ; g / g ) , synergistically increased the anti - obese effects of gt in hfd mice , and may be mediated by inhibition of lipid digestions by decrease of pancreatic enzyme production or releases .
since it also could be completely excluded that fgt induced the increases of digestive tract motility , more detailed mechanism studies should be conducted in the future to elucidate the exact anti - obese mechanisms of fgt .
increased digestive tract motility also induced increases of fecal excretions , and , consequently , induced decreases of body weight [ 60,61,62 ] and dose - dependent , marked and noticeable increases of fecal excretions with fecal tc and tg contents were observed by treatment of fgt .
the non - significant , slight elevation of fecal tc and tg contents detected in hfd control mice of this study is considered as a secondary result of hfd intake .
hba1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time , and produced by high glucose exposed erythrocytes for a long time [ 63 ] .
hyperglycemia is the main sign of diabetes , and hyperglycemia should be controlled to treat diabetes [ 10,14,15 ] .
as progression of type ii diabetes , marked elevations of blood insulin and hb1ac levels have been observed after long term hfd supply [ 34,41 ] .
in addition , increased insulin secretion is in part related to pancreatic islet hyperplasia with progression of insulin - resistance by hfd supply [ 64,65,66 ] .
total pancreatic islet numbers and insulin - producing cells were increased after chronic consumption of a hfd , islets increased in area and number in order to secrete more insulin to try to maintain glucose homeostasis [ 67 ] with noticeable hypertrophy or hyperplasia in endocrine pancreas cells [ 64,65,66,67 ] .
also , in this study , noticeable elevations of blood glucose , insulin and hba1c contents were detected in hfd control mice as compared with intact control , and with increases of pancreatic islet numbers , expansions , insulin - and glucagon - immunoreactive cells and insulin / glucagon cell ratios , suggesting the presence of type ii diabetes in the histopathological observations .
however , all three different dosages of fgt also effectively and dose - dependently inhibited these abnormal endocrine pancreas histopathological changes and elevations of blood glucose , insulin and hba1c contents , respectively. with the chronic development of diabetes in hfd mice , hyperlipidemia was also generally observed [ 6 ] .
since the most critical problem in hyperlipidemia is increases of serum ldl , tg and tc levels with a decrease of hdl levels [ 14,15,68 ] , the efficacy of hypolipidemic agents was generally evaluated based on the decrease of serums ldl , tg and tc with an increase of hdl levels [ 10,14,15,69 ] .
in this study , the treatment of fgt effectively and dose - dependently decreased the serum ldl , tg and tc levels , but favorably increased the serum hdl levels as compared with hfd control mice , suggesting fgt has favorable hypolipidemic effects on hfd mice .
it considered that fermentation with aquilariae lignum , synergistically increasing the hypolipidemic effects of gt , may be mediated by inhibition of lipid digestions by decrease of pancreatic enzyme production or releases .
these hypolipidemic effects of test substances detected in these hfd mice were also considered as a result of the decreases of lipid absorptions and propulsion of lipids into feces , through the pancreatic digestive enzyme modulating effects as aforementioned. with the progression of diabetes , increases of liver weight due to the fibrosis or abnormal glycosylation related hepatosteatosis and hepatocyte hypertrophic changes , due to lipid depositions in the cytoplasm , were observed with elevation of serum ast and alt levels [ 10,15,70 ] .
this phenomenon has been regarded as diabetic hepatopathy , and it also has been found in hfd supplied mice [ 15,71 ] .
improvement of these abnormal developments has been considered direct evidence of improved diabetic hepatopathies [ 70 ] .
also , the increases in kidney weights due to swelling , inflammation and necrotic processes were observed with elevation of serum bun and creatinine levels - - so - called diabetic nephropathy - - and improvement of these abnormal developments has been considered direct evidence of improved diabetic nephropathies [ 10,15 ] .
in this study , the treatment of fgt effectively and dose - dependently decreased the diabetic hepatopathies , inhibited the increases in liver weights , as well as serum ast and alt elevations with steatohepatitis and related hepatocyte hypertrophic changes that occurred in histopathological observation , and the diabetic nephropathies , inhibited the increases in kidney weights , serum bun and creatinine elevation with lipid droplet deposition related to renal tubule vacuolation in histopathological observation , as compared with hfd control mice , suggesting they have favorable hepatoprotective and nephroprotective effects on hfd mice .
there is considerable evidence of the role of free radicals in the etiology of diabetes and altered antioxidant defenses in diabetes [ 72 ] .
oxidative stress has been reported to play an important role in diabetes mellitus right from its genesis to the development of microvascular complications .
generation of free radicals by hyperglycemia is related to glucose auto - oxidation .
glucose auto - oxidation has been linked to non - enzymatic glycosylation , and glycosylated proteins have been shown to be a source of free radicals , ros [ 10,73 ] .
oxidative stress in diabetes coexists with a decrease in the antioxidant status [ 74 ] which can increase the deleterious effects of free radicals .
generation of ros related oxidative stress plays an important role in the etiology of diabetic complications [ 75 ] .
various toxic substances from lipid peroxidation destroy the surrounding tissues [ 76 ] , and elevations of lipid peroxidation in the various organs were also demonstrated in hfd mice , and they also acted as a potent redox cycler that generates harmful ros and causes organ damages [ 77,78 ] .
gsh is representative of endogenous antioxidants and prevents tissue damage by keeping the ros at low levels and at certain cellular concentrations , and is accepted as a protective endogenous antioxidant factor in tissues [ 79 ] .
sod is one of the antioxidant enzymes that contributes to enzymatic defense mechanisms , and cat is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of h2o2 to h2o [ 80 ] .
so , the increased lipid peroxidation and decrease of endogenous antioxidants - - gsh contents , and antioxidant active enzymes - - sod and cat activities in the damaged liver tissue are of secondary importance in terms of helping improve diabetes and various related complications [ 81,82 ] .
in addition , marked elevation of hepatic lipid peroxidation , depletion of gsh content , and decreases of sod and cat activities were noticed in hfd control , like other previous hfd mice studies [ 41,83 ] .
in this study , the treatment of fgt also effectively and dose - dependently inhibited the deterioration of the hepatic antioxidant defense system as compared with hfd control mice , suggesting favorable antioxidant effects of fgt on hfd mice .
the hepatic enzyme gk is related to glucose homeostasis and its increased expression could cause an increase in blood glucose utilization for energy production or glycogen storage in the liver , leading to a reduction in the blood glucose level [ 84 ] .
on the contrary , the enzymes g6pase and pepck are associated with gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose output and their increased activities denote increased glucose levels [ 85,86 ] .
generally , noticeable decreases of hepatic gk activities with increases of g6pase and pepck activities have been accompanied by hfd supply [ 41 ] , and also in hfd control mice in this study .
all three different dosages of fgt also effectively and dose - dependently inhibited hfd - induced hepatic glucose - regulating enzyme activity changes , the increases of hepatic gk activities , and decreases of hepatic g6pase and pepck activities as compared with those of hfd control mice .
5. conclusions the results obtained in this study suggest that fermentation with appropriated amounts of aquilariae lignum , 1:49 ( 2 % ; g / g ) synergistically increased the anti - diabetic effects of gt in hfd mice , through increases in the modulating effects on the hepatic glucose enzyme activities , the antioxidant and pancreatic lipid digestion enzymes , at least partially .
all three different dosages of fgt treated mice showed dose - dependent favorable effects , and especially , fgt 100 , 200 and 400 mg / kg treated hfd mice also showed significant and more favorable inhibitory activities against type ii diabetes and related complications - - including obesity , hyperlipidemia , hepatic steatosis , kidney failures and deterioration of the liver antioxidant defense system - - as compared with those of gt 400 mg / kg treated mice , and also in hepatic gk , g6pase and pepck activities , respectively .
overall hypolipidemic effects fgt 200 mg / kg were similar to those of simvastatin 10 mg / kg , and fgt 100 mg / kg showed similar favorable effects on the hfd - induced diabetes as well as ameliorating effects on diabetic complications as compared with metformin 250 mg / kg , through enhancement of the liver antioxidant defense system , modulating effects on pancreatic digestive enzymes and hepatic glucose - regulating enzyme activities , at least partially .
accordingly , fgt is promising as a new potent therapeutic agent for type ii diabetes and related complications , i.e. , metabolic syndrome .

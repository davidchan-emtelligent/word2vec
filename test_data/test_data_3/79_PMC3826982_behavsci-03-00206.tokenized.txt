abnormal hippocampal function likely contributes to relational learning deficits observed in schizophrenia .
it is unknown whether these deficits can be attenuated with a training intervention .
the purpose of this project was to determine if training could facilitate relational learning of the transverse patterning task in schizophrenia .
healthy and schizophrenia subjects completed a version of transverse patterning that incorporated training .
the majority of subjects with schizophrenia successfully learned transverse patterning when provided with training .
a subgroup ( approximately 25 %) of schizophrenia subjects showed no tendency to learn with training .
these results were replicated in a second study with a separate cohort and different stimuli .
this study illustrates that relational learning of the transverse patterning can be facilitated in schizophrenia with training .
schizophrenia relational learning training transverse patterning hippocampus medial temporal lobe memory 1 .
introduction hippocampal abnormalities figure prominently in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia [ 1 ] .
these abnormalities presumably contribute to learning and memory deficits commonly associated with this disorder .
relational learning putatively relies on intact hippocampal function [ 2,3 ] and may be particularly vulnerable in schizophrenia .
studies of schizophrenia that revealed performance impairments in transitive inference [ 4,5 ] and the virtual morris water task [ 6 ] , assessments of relational learning , support this prediction .
the transverse patterning ( tp ) problem provides a way to test relational memory [ 7 ] .
it is similar to the childhood game " rock , paper , scissors " , and requires the subject to learn the relationship among three items .
tp performance is dependent upon intact hippocampal function in a variety of species i.e. , rodents [ 8 ] , primates [ 9,10 ] , and humans [ 11,12 ] .
relevant to pathophysiology of schizophrenia , neonatal hippocampal lesions disrupt both tp learning and normal social behavior in adult monkeys [ 13 ] .
human studies of tp have revealed hippocampal bold signal changes with fmri [ 14,15,16 ] .
hippocampal source activity with magnetoencephalography [ 17 ] , and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy neurochemical measures [ 18 ] also vary with tp performance .
the purpose of this project was to determine if training could facilitate relational learning in subjects with schizophrenia .
healthy subjects learn the tp problem without training , when the three pairs are presented at once as in a standard task version [ 19 ] .
pilot work from our lab suggests that subjects with schizophrenia cannot learn the tp problem when provided with a standard version [ 20 ] .
therefore we instituted a stepwise training approach similar to one used in rodent , primate , and human studies [ 8,9,18,19 ] .
two studies were conducted with different subject cohorts .
the purpose of the second study was to determine if the results were reproducible and if relational learning could be further facilitated when the stimuli were simplified and meaningful .
one study using the tp task suggests performance is facilitated when " meaningful " stimuli are used [ 21 ] .
the first study used abstract figures and the second study used common shapes as stimuli .
the second study was conducted as part of a neuroimaging study and the neuroimaging data are presented elsewhere [ 16 ] .
2. methods the inclusion / exclusion criteria for subjects with schizophrenia were : ( 1 ) diagnosis of schizophrenia as determined with the structured clinical interview for dsm - iv , patient version ( scid - p ) [ 22 ] ; ( 2 ) no current or past neurological condition ; ( 3 ) no dsm - iv substance abuse in the last six months ; ( 4 ) clinically stable as determined by their treatment psychiatrist ; and ( 5 ) same type and dose antipsychotic for at least three months .
the inclusion / exclusion criteria for healthy volunteers were : ( 1 ) no past or present psychiatric disorder as determined with the structured clinical interview for dsm - iv , non - patient version ( scid - np ) [ 23 ] ; ( 2 ) no first - degree relatives with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder ; ( 3 ) no current or past neurological condition .
subjects with schizophrenia were evaluated for their ability to provide informed consent before signing consent documents .
all subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation in the study .
this project was approved by the university of maryland internal review committee .
2.1 .
task the task procedures have been described in animal and human studies [ 8,18,19 ] where two conditions , tp and simple discrimination ( sd ) , were administered in a stepwise fashion .
for the relational learning tp condition , subjects learned the relationship between three pairs of overlapping , ambiguous stimuli ( e.g. , a > b , b > c , c > a ) ; and for the nonrelational learning sd condition subjects learned the simple discrimination of three pairs of nonoverlapping stimuli ( e.g. , d > e , f > g , h > i ) .
subjects completed six phases ( see figure 1 for illustration ) .
phases 1 - 3 pertained to the sd condition and phases 4 - 6 pertained to the tp condition .
trials were presented in blocks that contained 16 trials per pair .
advancement to the next phase required the subject to score 13 out of 16 correct responses per pair within a block .
this criterion was important to ensure subjects were learning the entire problem and not a subset of it. a maximum of 10 blocks per phase was allowed .
for phases 1 and 4 which included one pair , the maximum number of trials was 160 ; for phases 2 and 5 which included two pairs the maximum number of trials was 320 ; and phases 3 and 6 which included three pairs the maximum number of trials was 480 .
the last phase 6 of tp is considered hippocampal - dependent .
the computerized task was created with eprime software ( psychology software tools , inc. ) .
figure 1 illustration of the task .
for a trial , one pair of stimuli illustrated above is presented .
the subject 's goal is to learn the correct item in each pair .
a "+" indicates the correct choice and a " - " indicates an incorrect choice .
the transverse patterning ( tp ) condition requires relational learning , whereby an item is correct or incorrect depending on the item it is paired with .
the simple discrimination ( sd ) condition does not require relational learning .
the task comprised six phases .
task procedures were similar for studies 1 and 2 except for the stimuli .
( a ) the abstract stimuli for study 1 are illustrated in a .
( b ) the " shape " stimuli for study 2 are illustrated in b. task procedures were identical for the two studies except for the stimuli .
the task stimuli for study 1 were abstract figures and the task stimuli for study 2 were common shapes ( see figure 1 ) .
2.2 .
data analyses trials to criterion were analyzed with 2 ( group ) x 3 ( phase ) anovas , with repeated measures on phase , separately for the sd and tp conditions .
statistically significant interaction effects were followed up with post - hoc tests when appropriate .
the relationships between number of trials to criterion and psychiatric measures were computed with pearson 's product moment correlations .
to examine if type of stimuli impacted performance , trials to criterion were analyzed with 2 ( group ) x 2 ( study ; abstract , shape ) x 3 ( phase ) anovas , with repeated measures on phase , separately for the sd and tp conditions .
all statistical tests were two - tailed .
analyses were conducted with the statistical package for social sciences ( spss ) version 12.0 [ 24 ] .
3. results 3.1 .
study 1 twenty subjects with a dsm - iv - tr diagnosis of schizophrenia ( 10 females ; mean age 43 years ) and 20 healthy control subjects ( 9 females , mean age 42 years ) participated in this study .
subjects with schizophrenia were clinically stable ( brief psychiatric rating scale [ bprs ; 25 ]) total mean = 34.2 sd = 6.8 ) and all but three were treated with second - generation antipsychotic medication .
the average level of function as determined by the level of function scale ( lofs ) was 23 ( sd = 6.4 ) .
there was no significant difference in age , gender , handedness , or level of education between groups ( all p 's > 0.05 ) .
means and standard deviations for tp and sd performance are presented in figure 2 .
all subjects reached criteria for all phases of the nonrelational learning control condition ( sd ) .
there were no statistically significant differences between groups for the individual sd phases 1 - 3 .
all subjects reached criteria for phases 4 and 5 of the relational learning tp condition .
there was a significant group x phase interaction ( f = 6.2 , p < 0.05 , df = 1 , 38 ) .
post - hoc tests revealed that the groups performed similarly on phase 4 but subjects with schizophrenia required more trials to reach criterion on phases 5 ( t = 2.86 , p = 0.007 , df = 1 , 38 ) and 6 ( t = 2.48 , p = 0.018 , df = 1 , 38 ) .
it is important to note that even though subjects with schizophrenia as a group required more trials to reach criteria compared to controls on phase 5 , all subjects with schizophrenia successfully completed this phase .
when the groups were divided into those who learned ( i.e. , reached criteria on phase 6 ( the hippocampal - dependent condition ) versus those who did not learn , the majority of subjects with schizophrenia ( 75 % , 15 out of 20 ) were able to learn the tp problem .
ninety - five percent ( 19 out of 20 ) of the control subjects reached criteria for tp. when " learners " only were examined , there were no statistically significant differences between control and schizophrenia " learners " on number of trials to reach criterion for tp phase 6 but the magnitude of difference was moderate ( cohen 's d = 0.42 ) .
figure 2 means ( sd ) for number of trials to criterion for study 1 .
( a ) trials to criterion for the sd condition that does not require relational learning .
( b ) trials to criterion for the tp condition that is hippocampal - dependent and requires relational learning .
to determine whether the " nonlearners " in the schizophrenia group showed a tendency toward any level of learning , the accuracy levels were determined for the first and last blocks in phase 6 .
the nonlearners showed no tendency to learn .
the mean ( sd ) accuracy for the first and last blocks was 49 % ( 5 ) and 49.5 % ( 3.6 ) , respectively .
to determine if nonlearners showed a tendency to learn the last pair ( i.e. , pair number 3 ) in phase 6 , the accuracy levels were determined for the individual tp pairs .
the nonlearners showed no tendency to learn the last pair and showed a performance decrease for pairs 1 and 2 .
the mean ( sd ) accuracy for tp pairs 1 , 2 , and 3 was 51.2 % ( 14.3 ) , 51.1 % ( 14.4 ) , 51.6 % ( 15.9 ) , respectively .
there were no significant relationships between the number of trials to reach criterion for tp ( phase 6 ) or sd ( phase 3 ) and psychiatric symptoms ( bprs total , positive and negative scales or lofs ) .
3.2 .
study 2 seventeen subjects with a dsm - iv - tr diagnosis of schizophrenia ( 8 females ; mean age 42 years ) and 17 healthy control subjects ( 8 females , mean age 41 years ) participated in this study .
subjects with schizophrenia were clinically stable ( bprs total mean = 31 sd = 6.3 ) and all but four were treated with second - generation antipsychotics .
the average level of function as determined by the lofs was 24.2 ( sd = 5.8 ) .
subjects with schizophrenia had fewer years of education ( t = 2.59 , p < 0.05 , df = 32 ) .
there were no significant differences in age or gender between groups ( all p 's > 0.05 ) .
means and standard deviations for tp and sd performance are presented in figure 3 .
all subjects reached criteria for all phases of the nonrelational learning control condition ( sd ) and phases 4 and 5 of the relational learning tp condition .
there were no statistically significant or marginal differences between groups for any of the individual phases ( all p 's > 0.27 ) .
similar to study 1 , the majority of subjects with schizophrenia ( 71 % , 12 out of 17 ) were able to learn the tp problem ( i.e. , reached criteria on phase 6 the hippocampal - dependent condition ) .
ninety - four percent ( 16 out of 17 ) of the control subjects reached criteria for tp. to determine whether the " nonlearners " in the schizophrenia group showed a tendency toward any level of learning , the accuracy levels were determined for the first and last blocks in phase 6 .
the nonlearners showed no improvement from the first to the last block .
the mean ( sd ) accuracy for the first and last blocks was 60.8 % ( 6.7 ) and 57.1 % ( 10.8 ) , respectively .
to determine if nonlearners showed a tendency to learn the last pair ( i.e. , pair number 3 ) in phase 6 , the accuracy levels were determined for the individual tp pairs .
the nonlearners showed no tendency to learn the last pair and showed a slight decrement in accuracy for pair 2 .
the mean ( sd ) accuracy for tp pairs 1 , 2 , and 3 was 85.3 % ( 15.6 ) , 56.1 % ( 18.4 ) , 27.1 % ( 15.8 ) , respectively .
consistent with study 1 , there were no significant relationships between the number of trials to reach criterion for tp ( phase 6 ) or sd ( phase 3 ) and psychiatric symptoms ( bprs total , positive and negative scales or lofs ) .
figure 3 means ( sd ) for number of trials to criterion for study 2 .
( a ) trials to criterion for the sd condition .
( b ) trials to criterion for the tp condition .
3.3 .
study 1 and study 2 comparison for the sd condition , there were no significant interactions but there was a significant main effect of study ( f = 5.22 , p = 0.025 , df = 1 , 70 ) indicating a greater number of trials to criterion for study 1 compared to study 2 averaged across group and phase .
there was also a significant main effect of group ( f = 5.93 , p = 0.017 , df = 1 , 70 ) indicating a greater number of trials to criterion for schizophrenia compared to healthy controls averaged across study and phase .
for the tp condition , there were no significant interactions or main effect with study included as a between subjects factor ( all p 's > 0.4 ) .
therefore , the type of stimuli did not significantly impact tp performance .
there was , however , a group x phase interaction ( f = 6.34 , p = 0.014 , df = 1 , 70 ) .
post - hoc follow - up tests revealed greater number of trials to criterion for the hippocampal - dependent phase 6 in the schizophrenia compared to the control group ( t = 2.59 , p = 0.012 , df = 1 , 72 ) .
4. discussion relational learning deficits have been frequently reported in schizophrenia [ 4,5,6,26,27 ] but the impact of training is unknown .
the purpose of this project was to determine if training could facilitate relational learning of the transverse patterning task in schizophrenia .
results from two separate cohorts showed that the majority of subjects with schizophrenia successfully achieved relational learning proficiency when provided with training .
moreover there was a subgroup of subjects with schizophrenia whose performance remained impaired despite the training intervention .
extensive research suggests that stepwise tp learning requires intact hippocampal function [ 8,9,10,11,12,13 ] .
the subgroup of subjects with schizophrenia that failed to learn the tp problem may have a severely dysfunctional hippocampal system .
supporting this supposition , two fmri studies reported differences in hippocampal activation between schizophrenia and control groups during transitive inference [ 4 ] and transverse patterning [ 16 ] tasks .
however , high and low performers with schizophrenia were not compared in these studies .
results of a pilot magnetoencephalography ( meg ) study showed enhanced bilateral hippocampal source activation during successful ( 89 % accuracy ) tp learning in nine subjects with schizophrenia compared to controls [ 28 ] .
future neuroimaging studies may help determine whether performance differences between learner and nonlearner subjects with schizophrenia can be explained by brain structural , chemical or functional differences .
another plausible explanation is that those subjects with schizophrenia with successful relational learning do so through alternative , extra - hippocampal brain networks .
literature on neuroplasticity , rehabilitation , and aging [ 29,30 ] supports the concept that if a brain region of the network is faulty , other brain regions compensate for its diminished function. with respect to rl , one study reported successful rl in an amnesic patient [ 31 ] .
this patient was able to successfully perform a rl task by relying on semantic knowledge strategy despite having extensive bilateral mtl damage .
hence , it is plausible that rl can be accomplished through extra - mtl brain regions .
it is reasonable to suppose there may be a subgroup of subjects with schizophrenia that perform normally on relational learning paradigms if provided with a training intervention .
in both studies there were subgroups of subjects with schizophrenia that did not learn the tp problem in spite of ample trial opportunities .
these findings are consistent with the concept that subjects with schizophrenia fall into subgroups of good and poor learners [ 32,33,34,35 ] .
given that nonlearners were as proficient as learners on the sd task , it is unlikely that poor tp performance is due to a generalized cognitive deficit .
moreover , the nonlearners did not differ in demographic , medication status , or psychiatric symptom measures from the learners with schizophrenia .
overall these findings lend further support to the heterogeneity of schizophrenia .
contrary to expectation the simplified , recognizable stimuli employed in study 2 did not further facilitate learning performance in subjects with schizophrenia who successfully learned the tp problem .
it is possible that as long as each stimulus is unique and easily distinguished the nature of the stimuli , abstract or concrete , has little impact .
anecdotal evidence from post - task debriefing supports this notion since most subjects , in both diagnostic groups reported assigning names to the abstract stimuli as part of their cognitive strategy .
however , it is possible that simplified , recognizable stimuli did facilitate learning performance in the nonlearner subjects with schizophrenia despite them not learning the full tp problem .
there are some study considerations .
first , antipsychotic medications may affect learning .
however , the majority of subjects with schizophrenia were taking second - generation antipsychotic medications .
three subjects with schizophrenia were taking first - generation antipsychotic medications in study 1 and four in study 2 .
all subjects with schizophrenia had been treated with the same dose of antipsychotic medication for at least three months immediately prior to the study .
the seven subjects taking first generation antipsychotics did not differ on psychiatric symptom ratings or learning performance when compared to the subjects taking second - generation antipsychotics .
second , one could argue that the subjects with schizophrenia who did not successfully learn the tp problem simply perform worse on tasks that are more difficult .
this cannot be fully ruled out .
however , these subjects did not differ from the successful patient learners on the phase 3 of the control task that was matched for the number of stimulus pairs as phase 6 of the tp problem , nor did they differ on phase 5 of the tp problem .
5. conclusions by focusing on a training program that facilitates learning success this study contributes to an emerging view of learning in schizophrenia .
subjects with schizophrenia may be able to reach remarkably normal cognitive skills when engaged in systematic , reinforced training programs [ 36,37 ] in spite of their having aberrant neural strategies [ 16,38 ] .
this concept may be important since learning potential is related to rehabilitation outcome in schizophrenia [ 39 ] .

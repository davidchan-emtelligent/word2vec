background legal empowerment of the poor is highly relevant to public health as it aims to relieve income poverty , a main determinant of health .
the commission on legal empowerment of the poor ( clep ) has proposed legal empowerment measures in the following four domains : access to justice and the rule of law , property , labor , and business rights .
despite being overrepresented among the poor , clep has not explicitly considered the situation of people with disabilities .
objectives to examine the empirical evidence for the relevance of the clep legal empowerment measures to people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries , and to evaluate the extent to which the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities ( crpd ) addresses those measures .
methods critical literature review of empirical studies and a checklist assessment of the crpd .
results fourteen included articles confirm that people with disabilities experience problems in the domains of access to justice and the rule of law , labor rights , and business rights .
no texts on property rights were found .
evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed measures is insufficient .
overall , the crpd fully or partially supports two - thirds of the proposed measures ( seven out of nine measures for access to justice and the rule of law , none of the five measures for property rights , all seven measures for labor rights , and six out of nine measures for business rights ) .
conclusions although most of the domains of the clep legal empowerment measures are relevant to people with disabilities from both empirical and normative perspectives , it is uncertain whether the devised measures are of immediate relevance to them .
further research is warranted in this regard .
developing country disability legal empowerment low - income country poverty legal empowerment may be understood as the use of law specifically to strengthen the disadvantaged ( 1 ) .
legal empowerment of the poor is highly relevant to public health as it aims at relieving income poverty , a main determinant of health .
considering the links between income poverty , health , and disability in low - income countries ( 2 , 3 ) , legal empowerment of the poor may be of particular relevance to people with disabilities in these countries .
legal empowerment of the poor can be seen as a broader tool as it also addresses other important social determinants of health , such as improving the circumstances in which people live and work ( 4 ) .
to improve health and health equity , the inequitable distribution of and access to power , wealth , and social resources need to be tackled .
unfair distribution of and access to these means are often tolerated or promoted by social norms , policies , and practices .
potentially , every aspect of government and the economy affect health and health equity .
immediate risks for ill health , which are distributed in an inequitable way , are determined by factors at a higher societal level , for example , the political , judicial , and economic system , which reflects the specific power relations of that society .
besides bringing health benefits in the form of new technologies , goods and services , and improved standards of living , the market place can also generate negative conditions for health , for example , unhealthy working conditions , environmental pollution , and economic inequalities ( 5 , 6 ) .
hosted by the united nations development programme ( undp ) , the international commission on legal empowerment of the poor ( clep ) was formed in 2005 to focus on the link among exclusion , poverty , and the law .
in its final report entitled ' making the law work for everyone ' , clep estimated that at least four billion people are excluded from the rule of law ( 7 ). by giving poor women and men access to justice , and by underpinning and enabling certain rights , the report argues that they can be empowered to change their lives for the better .
despite poverty being the reality for many of the world 's one billion people with disabilities ( 3 ) , the report does not explicitly relate to them .
therefore , drawing from available evidence , this article intends to explore the relevance of the recommendations made by the report for reducing poverty - and thereby promote health - among people with disabilities living in countries where incomes in general are low .
legal empowerment in the report , legal empowerment is viewed as a process through which poor people become protected and are enabled to use the law to advance their rights and their interests .
it involves them realizing their rights and reaping resulting opportunities through public support as well as efforts of themselves , their supporters , and networks ( 7 ) .
since legal empowerment ( as a political concept ) was first coined by the asian development bank in the asia foundation report from 2001 ( 8 ) , it has been used and defined by a number of different institutions such as the carnegie endowment for international peace ( 9 ) .
the concept gained particular momentum through the report , which perceives legal empowerment as a ' global social contract ' primarily encompassing access to justice and the rule of law , property rights , labor rights , and business rights ( 10 ) .
property rights , labor rights , and so - called business rights have been singled out as particular vital empowerment domains , mostly due to their connection to economic agency ; an area essential for development in general and poverty reduction in particular .
together with access to justice and the rule of law , these three domains are labeled ' pillars of legal empowerment ' ( the pillars ) ( 7 ) .
( clep recognizes that ' business rights' is not a human rights category per se and does not advocate for it to be established as such , but acknowledges that this category is ' derived from [ other ] existing rights related to doing business of the individual ' ( 7 , p. 5 ).) legal empowerment is claimed to highlight a ' forgotten ' dimension of poverty not covered by the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) : that poverty is an outcome of legal deprivation , that is , there is a lack of legal recognition and protection of rights for excluded groups ( 11 ) .
in this context , the primary function of legal empowerment of the poor is to advance ' the process of systemic change through which the poor and excluded become able to use the law , the legal system and legal services , to protect and advance their rights and interests as citizens and economic actors' ( 7 , p. 3 ) .
legal empowerment does not consist of a single strategy , but it usually targets disadvantaged populations , and focuses on the use of law , the legal system and legal services in broad terms as instruments for development , sustainable livelihood , and poverty reduction for the disadvantaged ( 12 ) .
the pillars are based on a human rights - based approach and draws from the universal declaration of human rights ( udhr ) ( 13 ) .
the first pillar access to justice and the rule of law follows from udhr articles 6 and 7 , the second pillar property rights finds its basis in udhr article 17 , and the third pillar labor rights is based on udhr article 23 .
the fourth pillar business rights is a composite of rights of people to engage in economic activity and market transactions .
they include the right of people to start a legally recognized business without arbitrarily applied regulations or discrimination in the application of norms and procedures .
it focuses on removing unnecessary barriers that limit economic opportunities and on protecting the investments that people make in their enterprises .
business activities are an expression of an entire class of liberties , namely freedom of association , freedom of movement , freedom to develop one 's own talents , and freedom to exchange legitimately acquired goods and services ( 7 ) .
the report acknowledges that poverty eradication cannot be accomplished through legal empowerment alone .
however , although not sufficient in itself , legal empowerment is regarded as a necessary remedy for inclusion economically , politically , socially , and morally ( 7 ) .
considering its recommendations being top - down , impractical and unrealistic , the report has received criticism ( 14 , 15 ) .
moreover , it has been argued that legal empowerment of the poor needs to be linked with general development experience , and that the report fails to justify its policy agenda with empirical data ( 16 , 17 ) .
despite its shortcomings , it has been claimed that the report has contributed to the international development community by focusing attention on legal needs of poor populations ( 15 ) .
disability people with disabilities in low - income countries are often deprived of basic human rights and overrepresented among the poor ( 3 , 18 - 20 ) .
compared to those without disabilities , they generally have lower employment rates and educational attainment .
there is a growing evidence base that indicates substantial links among poverty , health , and disability in these countries ( 2 , 3 ) .
the international classification of functioning , disability and health ( icf ) intends to encompass all aspects of human health and some health - relevant components of well - being .
it describes them in terms of health domains and health - related domains .
examples of health domains include seeing , hearing , walking , learning and remembering , while examples of health - related domains include education , work and employment , and transportation ( 21 ) .
according to the icf , disability is understood as the negative aspects of the dynamic interaction between an individual 's health conditions ( diseases , disorders , injuries , traumas , etc. ) , personal factors ( gender , race , age , fitness , lifestyle , habits , social background , education , profession , etc. ) and environmental factors ( elements of the physical , social , and attitudinal environments ) .
disability is used as an umbrella term for impairments , activity limitations , and participation restrictions ( 21 ) .
the environmental factors in the icf focus on two different levels : individual and societal .
at the individual level , the factors include physical and material features of , and direct contacts with others in the immediate environment of an individual ( e.g. home , school , and workplace ) .
at the societal level , the factors encompass formal and informal social structures , services , and overarching approaches or systems in the community or society ( e.g. organizations and services related to the work environment , government agencies , communication and transportation services , informal social networks , laws , regulations , and attitudes ) .
society may hinder an individual 's performance by creating barriers ( e.g. inaccessible buildings ) or by not providing facilitators ( e.g. unavailability of wheelchairs , hearing aids or other assistive technology ) ( 21 ) .
both elimination of barriers and provision of facilitators may be addressed through adoption and implementation of appropriate legislation , which is thus considered an environmental factor at societal level ( 21 ) .
a key example is the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities ( crpd ) , which was adopted in late 2006 to promote , protect , and ensure the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all people with disabilities ( 22 ) .
regarded as having empowered the world 's largest minority , it focuses on the actions states must take to ensure that people with disabilities can enjoy civil , cultural , economic , political , and social rights on an equal basis with others ( 22 , 23 ) .
rights , health , and development legal empowerment is a strategy to facilitate human development through realization of a selected number of human rights .
therefore , it has been suggested that this approach is viewed as a subset of the broader human rights - based approach to development and poverty reduction ( 16 ) .
human development has increasingly been seen as expanding economic , social , cultural , and political freedoms rather than economic growth alone ( 24 ). through his capability approach , sen connects human development to human rights ( 25 , 26 ) .
he suggests that human rights can be seen as entitlements to capabilities ( things a person is substantively free to do or be ) and that expanding capabilities is development ( 26 , 27 ) .
this expansion can be accomplished by providing access to such basic capabilities as healthcare , education , and the labor market , which are all integral parts of the pillars ( 7 , 28 ) .
equity - driven development should be viewed as a contribution to sustainability , as redistribution to the poor in the form of improving their health , education , and nutrition will have impacts on the current as well as future generations ( 29 ) .
it is well known that health is both a consequence of and a factor contributing to the development of societies .
health is thereby central to sustainable development and its components of social , economic , and ecological sustainability .
unequally distributed resources in a society have a major impact on health and its social distribution .
equity , therefore , appears to be a key for sustainability defined as the survival and well - being of humans ( 30 ) .
thus , considering legal empowerment as an equalizer of poverty alleviating opportunities , it plays a role for more sustainable and healthier societies .
aim and objectives the purpose of this study has been to contribute to expanding the knowledge about strategies to reduce poverty among people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries from a rights perspective , while keeping in mind potential positive health and sustainability outcomes .
considering that the clep recommendations neither does explicitly address the situation of people with disabilities in these countries nor does it relate to the legal empowerment enshrined in the crpd , the specific aim was to explore the relevance of the pillars to them .
to fulfill this aim , the objectives have been : to examine the evidence base for the relevance of the pillars to people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries and to evaluate the extent to which the crpd addresses the pillars .
consequently , the study set out to answer the following research questions : what is the empirical evidence for problems related to the pillars among people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries and for solutions to those problems ?
to what extent does the crpd provide normative support for the pillars ?
methods the first research question was addressed through a critical review and the second one through a checklist assessment .
critical review to examine the evidence base , qualitative and quantitative research articles were searched in the following databases on october 11 , 2012 : cinahl , heinonline , pubmed , socindex , web of science .
using boolean technique , the following combination of search terms was used in each database : ( disab * or handic * or impair *) and ( developing countr * or low income countr * or low income econom * or lower middle income countr * or lower middle income econom *) and ( legal * empower * or poverty or poor or human right * or labour or labor or employment or work or propert * or rule of law or justice or exclusion or ( freedom and ( produce or trade or consume or exchange ))) .
although health , education , and social security issues are included in the domains of the pillars , such search terms were not included in this search .
an article was included if it presents original qualitative or quantitative research findings about the situation of people with disabilities with regard to the pillars in a low - or lower middle - income countries , as defined by the world bank as of july 2012 ( 31 ) , and was published in a peer - reviewed journal in 2002 or later .
studies covering low - or lower middle - income countries were included .
studies in upper middle countries were included if they also involved low - or lower middle - income countries .
studies in upper middle - income countries only were excluded .
articles not dealing with long - term physical , sensory , mental , or intellectual disabilities were excluded .
without language restriction searches were performed in titles and abstracts , in databases where such limits were possible , or in article texts .
an overview of the process of selecting articles is given in fig. 1. the titles and abstracts of a total of 1,308 hits generated by searches in the databases were screened manually .
a search record by database is presented in table 1 .
duplicates and articles not meeting the criteria were excluded , resulting in an initial list of 23 articles potentially relevant to this study .
the full articles in the initial list were studied and articles not meeting all criteria were excluded resulting in an intermediate list of 11 articles .
the reference lists were searched for any additional research meeting the selection criteria .
this added another two articles. from the authors' knowledge , one accepted but not yet published article was added .
the selected articles in the intermediate list and the added articles were reviewed and a data extraction form was completed for each of them .
based on extracted data , the authors discussed the articles and determined that all 14 articles would be included in the final list. fig. 1 process of selecting articles .
table 1 results of database searches database records cinahl 37 heinonline 7 pubmed 339 socindex 32 web of science 893 data from articles in the final list were analyzed and the findings categorized according to four domains corresponding to the pillars .
as the studies varied widely in designs and methods , a complete evaluation of the strength of the evidence was not carried out .
however , when applicable , information about sample size , study design , and instrumentation were compiled .
checklist assessment in order to evaluate the extent to which the crpd addresses the pillars , a checklist assessment was undertaken .
this method may be used when evaluating , for example , health policies to know whether a policy adequately addresses various content issues and have included appropriate actions ( 32 , 33 ) .
first , a checklist based on the measures and liberties proposed in the report was developed .
the checklist comprises 30 items in four domains , which correspond to the four pillars .
second , the content of the crpd was assessed using the checklist .
the extent to which the crpd addresses each legal empowerment measure was rated addressed not at all , addressed partly or addressed fully .
only specific crpd measures were considered .
thus , general stipulations such as ' take all necessary measures' or ' take appropriate steps' were not taken into account in this evaluation .
results the findings from the critical review and the checklist assessment are presented in the following sections .
overview of review findings as described above , a total of 14 articles were included in the final list .

they conclude that bringing people with disabilities into this process can be a powerful tool for improving their situation , as it empowers people with disabilities , develops the capacities of their organizations , and raise awareness about their situation among government and civil society .
in cambodia , community bodies planned to include disability aspects in their local development plans ( 35 ) .
property rights none of the reviewed articles explicitly addresses property rights .
in her qualitative study of the situation of 30 nepalese women with physical disabilities , dhungana ( 36 ) noted that they were denied the right of equal inheritance of property irrespective of disability status , although disability brings discrimination one step further .
labor rights labor rights issues were addressed by 13 of the reviewed articles .
nine of them describe the situation of people with disabilities and five of them report on various interventions intended to improve the situation .
as indicated in table 4 , 12 of the reviewed articles are concerned with employment opportunities while two of them relate to health .
in nepal , dhungana ( 36 ) found that women with disabilities were discriminated against and excluded from employment .
similarly , kiani ( 37 ) reported that women with disabilities in cameroon had difficulty in obtaining employment due to discrimination by employers .
also , men with disabilities seemed to experience discrimination .
using survey data from rural india , mitra and sambamoorthi ( 38 ) found that the employment rates for men without disabilities were higher than for men with disabilities .
this difference was not explained by differences in human capital and productivity but may result from discrimination in access to employment and from differential returns to characteristics ( 38 ) .
the situation of men has also been studied in bangladesh. with an objective to examine the impact of disability on the quality of life , hosain et al .
( 39 ) conducted a survey and identified 162 bangladeshis with disabilities .
nearly 80 % of the men above 12 years of age reported that disability had some negative consequence on their employment , for example , lower salary than non - disabled , forced to change employment and unemployment ( 39 ) .
these findings are supported by further studies .
a comparison of the situations in 15 developing countries by mitra et al .
( 40 ) found that people with disabilities were employed to a statistically significantly less degree than people without disabilities in nine countries .
in afghanistan and zambia , trani and loeb ( 28 ) found that people with disabilities had lower access to the labor market .
people with cognitive , mental or multiple disabilities were the least likely to work ( 28 ) .
moreover , from a study in india , uppal and sarma ( 41 ) reported that disabilities and chronic illnesses have a negative association with the probability of working , the effect being stronger in rural areas .
the status of people with mental and psychosocial disabilities has been studied by drew et al .
( 34 ) .
they found that denial or restriction of employment rights and opportunities was the second most common rights violation ( after ' exclusion , marginalization , and discrimination in the community ') , and the workplace or potential workplace was the third most likely environment in which human rights violations take place ( after ' general community setting in everyday life ' and ' home and family settings ') .
more than 60 % of the respondents said that their ability to find or maintain a job was adversely affected by their mental or psychosocial disability ( 34 ) .
similarly , from a comparison of the situations of people without impairments and people with musculoskeletal impairments ( msis ) in rwanda , rischewski et al .
( 42 ) reported that the latter group was less likely to be employed .
people with disabilities in afghanistan and zambia tended to have less access to healthcare services ( 28 ) .
after these descriptions of the situations of people with disabilities with regard to labor rights , interventions that intend to address the problems in this domain are presented in the following .
fritz et al .
( 35 ) report that as a result of an inclusive poverty - reduction strategy process in cambodia , contacts were established between community councils and organizations and groups of people with disabilities .
these councils then took certain actions , including certification of people with disabilities as poor citizens with free access to health centers , and messages to reduce discrimination against people with disabilities and encourage them to participate in socio - economic activities .
cooperation mechanisms were established between official stakeholders and organizations of people with disabilities .
creating sustainable structures of empowerment was found to be crucial ( 35 ) .
in nepal , dhungana ( 36 ) found that women got less access to vocational training programs than men .
men got training in skills that are in high demand and which command good salaries , while women were trained in skills they would not be able to use in their villages , which consequently prevented them from returning home to work ( 36 ) .
this finding is supported by a case study of a community - based vocational rehabilitation ( cbvr ) program for people with disabilities carried out by alade ( 43 ) in nigeria .
she found that 90 % of 155 participants had been gainfully employed .
four features of the program were : an orientation toward skills required locally ; a preference for non - formal short - cycle program ; a reliance on local markets and resources ; and promotion of local participation in planning and implementation ( 43 ) .
presenting case studies of corporate social responsibility projects in bangladesh , werner ( 44 ) notes that one of them targeted women with disabilities and that it increased their employment opportunities by improving their job skills .
in a study of 583 people with hearing or ambulatory impairments in bangladesh , borg et al .
( 45 ) found that the use of assistive technology was associated with certain labor rights .
compared to people with hearing impairments who did not use hearing aids , users of hearing aids were more likely to report better access to medical care , better physical and mental health , and higher participation in work .
however , working status did not differ significantly between users and non - users of hearing aids .
in the ambulatory group , people using wheelchairs were less likely to work compared to people not using wheelchairs .
after adjusting for the level of physical accessibility to the working place , there were no significant differences in work status between these groups .
however , wheelchair users reported a higher level of participation in work .
among wheelchair users alone , it was found that those who had used their wheelchair for a longer period of time were more likely to work ( 45 ) .
business rights eleven reviewed articles addressed issues related to business rights .
the situation of people with disabilities with regard to these rights is described in eight of them , while measures to overcome related problems are addressed by four articles .
nine articles are concerned with issues of developing one 's own talents and four articles address freedom of movement .
opportunities to develop one 's own talents through education are lacking for people with disabilities in many countries .
in 14 out of the 15 countries studied by mitra et al .
( 40 ) , people with disabilities had completed primary school to a significantly less degree than people without disabilities. from afghanistan and zambia , trani and loeb ( 28 ) reported that people with disabilities have lower access to education , particularly women .
similarly , women with disabilities in nepal reported little or no education , and , as mentioned above , they also got less from the vocational training that they received ( 36 ) .
in their study in bangladesh , hosain et al .
( 39 ) found that 41 out of 57 respondents aged 5 - 30 years had been unable to attend school due to disability or were compelled to leave school ( 39 ) .
also , rischewski et al .
( 42 ) found that children with msis were less likely to attend school .
in the north west province of cameroon , women with disabilities had difficulties in obtaining employment due to lack of education .
however , they desired to learn income - generating skills and entrepreneurships and expressed a need for capital to run and maintain businesses ( 37 ) .
freedom of movement is limited for people with disabilities .
in nepal , inaccessible transportation services , buildings , and toilets as well as the lack of ramps in public areas were identified as major obstacles to freedom of movement , which in turn prevented them from looking for training and jobs and sometimes keeping a job ( 36 ) .
in cameroon , women with disabilities found it difficult to move around and reach markets , workplaces , and so on , partly because there was no public or accessible transportation system .
in addition , they faced negative attitudes when attempting to use taxis or when using the road ( 37 ) .
savill et al .
( 46 ) identified three types of barriers experienced by people with disabilities when using public transport services in urban areas of four countries , namely structural , social , and psychological barriers .
after these descriptions , measures intended to improve the enjoyment of business rights are reported below .
following an inclusive poverty - reduction process in cambodia , commune councils called for people with disabilities to participate in vocational training programs ( 35 ) .
as already mentioned above , one of the corporate social responsibility projects in bangladesh increased job skills for women with disabilities , which led to better employment opportunities ( 44 ) .
the cbvr program in nigeria included a revolving loan scheme enabling 15 trainees to purchase equipment and materials for their trades .
due to the general breakdown of the country 's economy , most of the beneficiaries experienced difficulties in making regular installments to pay back the loan , which hampered the revolving loan scheme and deprived others from its benefit ( 43 ) .
the study of borg et al .
( 45 ) in bangladesh reported that users of hearing aids were more likely to report literacy , higher education and higher participation in school than non - users with hearing impairments .
they were also more likely to report higher participation in using public transportation and better ambulatory performance .
in the ambulatory group , wheelchair use was associated with better ambulatory performance .
there was also a positive relation between physical accessibility and level of participation in work ( 45 ) .
checklist assessment the extent to which the crpd addresses the pillars is summarized in table 4 .
the checklist indicates which articles ( or parts of articles ) of the crpd address which legal empowerment measure and to what extent .
measures lacking article numbers in their rows were not addressed at all by the crpd .
regarding the nine legal empowerment measures for access to justice and the rule of law , the crpd addresses four measures fully , three partly and two not at all .
the crpd does not address any of the five empowerment measures related to property rights .
four out of seven legal empowerment measures related to labor rights are addressed fully and three partly .
finally , out of nine legal empowerment measures related to business rights , two are addressed fully , four partly and three not at all .
in summary , 10 out of 30 empowerment measures recommended by the report are fully addressed by the crpd , 10 partly addressed , and 10 not addressed at all .
discussion discussion of findings legal empowerment is considered to be a process through which poor people become protected and are enabled to use the law to advance their rights and their interests .
this study has explored the empirical and normative relevance of the four clep pillars to people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries. with the exception for property rights , the reviewed articles offer relatively consistent evidence for people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries experiencing problems related to the pillars , even though not all subdomains were covered .
thus , the empirical findings indicate that several - if not all - problems addressed by the pillars are relevant to this population .
however , it is not possible to determine whether the suggested solutions are relevant , as the reviewed articles provide insufficient evidence for the effects of the recommended legal empowerment measures .
the assessment of the crpd revealed that two - thirds of the legal empowerment measures put forward in the report are required by the crpd to promote , protect , and ensure the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms , although only one third of the measures are fully supported by the crpd .
given the support for a majority of the measures , all of the pillars except property rights are considered to be normatively relevant .
suggested legal empowerment measures to address access to justice and the rule of law are relatively well supported by the crpd .
however , the crpd does not provide explicit support for the use of customary , informal or alternative legal procedures to improve access to justice and the rule of law .
only two empirical studies related to this domain were found , indicating that it is an under - researched area .
besides lacking normative support from the crpd , property rights issues for people with disabilities in low - and lower - middle income countries seem to be almost unexplored .
neither explicit descriptions of the situation nor possible intervention measures were found in the reviewed literature .
considering property rights being one of the pillars , the lack of normative support and empirical evidence was unexpected .
however , this may partly be explained by the lack of explicit property - related terms used in the search .
another reason may be that property rights is a complex matter .
it is not obvious that private ownership is always better than other alternatives .
for example , the benefits of private ownership of land over open - access depend on several factors , such as population density , dangers , and costs for enclosure .
under certain conditions , which take into consideration factors such as production level , returns from investments and economies of scale , a communal property system may be more beneficial than an individual property system .
moreover , recent findings indicate that those who possess at least the rights of proprietorship - if not full ownership - are able to govern and manage their systems more effectively than previously presumed ( 47 ) .
another property aspect likely to be of immediate relevance to people with disabilities in low - income countries , as they often belong to the most marginalized group of society , is land grabs of various scales .
although land grabs can have a positive impact on local communities , findings from sub - saharan africa indicate that the results are more often negative ( 48 ) .
considering the links among poverty , health , and disability ( 2 ) , land grabbing is likely to significantly affect the lives of people with disabilities if they are forced to leave their source of food or income without adequate long - term compensation .
no literature addressing this aspect has been found , indicating an immediate need to pay attention to land grab experiences and effects among this vulnerable population .
all suggested legal empowerment measures in the domain of labor rights are addressed by the crpd .
this domain also had the largest body of empirical findings describing the situation of people with disabilities and possible interventions .
however , with few exceptions , the identified literature addressed employment and work only .
the limited number of articles on health and healthcare may be explained by not including health terms in the search .
the reason being that they are probably among the most studied areas with respect to people with disabilities ( see e.g. ref. 3 ) .
none of the studies on labor rights were longitudinal .
most of the legal empowerment measures to support business rights find some normative support in the crpd , although it is not always as specific .
identified empirical evidence is mainly concerned with education , vocational training , and skills development .
only a few studies attempt to describe the effects of related interventions .
there are some studies describing barriers to limitations in enjoying the freedom of movement , while only one study of a possible facilitator was identified .
however , it is not a longitudinal study .
based on this review , certain legal empowerment measures recommended by the report are supported empirically and normatively .
however , the suggested measures go beyond both what the crpd requires and what is supported by the identified evidence base .
the report has previously been criticized for lack of clarity and unsubstantiated claims ( 16 ) .
therefore , it remains to be seen if its suggested measures for reducing poverty hold true for people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries , or if other factors will continue to be more important causes of poverty .
in addition to general causal factors , the opportunities for poverty reduction may be limited due to more immediate factors , such as stigma , and lack of access to rehabilitation services , assistive technology , and physically and cognitively accessible facilities ( 3 , 49 ) .
although the crpd is regarded as having empowered the world 's largest minority ( 23 ) , the recommendations of the report suggests that implementing only the crpd would not be sufficient to reduce poverty for this group .
in fact , drew et al .
( 34 ) argue that , besides adopting and applying the framework of the crpd , using a range of evidence - based strategies can help to promote human rights .
although no firm evidence was found through this review , complementing the crpd measures with legal empowerment measures recommended in the report may be considered .
concerning people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries , there appears to be a lack of evidence with respect to their poverty situation and appropriate poverty - reduction strategies .
in addition to the findings presented in this review , a recent critical review of the links among disability , poverty , and health concluded that the evidence is strikingly thin ( 2 ) .
considering the current empirical evidence for the pillars and recommended empowerment measures found through this literature review , the findings warrant research that clarifies whether all domains are relevant to people with disabilities and explores the effectiveness of suggested and other measures .
recognizing that countries differ geographically , culturally , socially , politically , and so on , studies in various settings are called for .
this would be helpful in informing the development and implementation of effective strategies aiming at reducing poverty among people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries , and thereby contribute to sustainable and healthier societies ( 30 ) .
discussion of limitations the critical review is limited in scope to the databases , search terms and the inclusion and exclusion criteria used .
although the labor and business rights domains of the pillars include measures related to health conditions and care , social security , and talent development ( education ) , search terms for these measures were not used as they have been studied and reported elsewhere ( 2 , 3 , 50 - 52 ) .
the domains of legal empowerment measures are somewhat overlapping , for example , measures 15 and 27 on freedom of association , which could have caused problems in categorizing articles .
but as no reviewed articles addressed freedom of association , such problems did not arise .
it may be argued that certain legal empowerment measures are relevant to domains other than those indicated in table 4 .
for example , ensuring freedom of movement is likely to be relevant to labor rights and its measure of access to medical care .
however , the operationalization of the pillars followed the measures devised by the report .
due to its inclusion criteria , the review has neither considered publications of related international organizations such as the global applied disability research and information network on employment and training ( gladnet ) , the international labour organization and the world bank , nor has un country reports been considered .
conclusions the crpd lends support to a majority of the legal empowerment measures recommended by the report , which indicates that most of them are relevant from a normative perspective .
considering that the empirical evidence demonstrates that several problems related to the pillars are experienced by people with disabilities in low - and lower middle - income countries , and that little has been published on solutions to these problems , it may be concluded that the problem areas are relevant while it is uncertain whether the devised measures are of immediate relevance to this population .
further research is required to explore the costs and effects of the proposed measures for reducing poverty and consequently promoting health , particularly in comparison with measures devised by the crpd .
the lack of normative and empirical perspectives on property rights calls for studies of their relevance .
conflict of interest and funding this study was funded by the lund university initiative on legal empowerment of the poor .

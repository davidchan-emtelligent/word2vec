introduction patients can provide consent to have their clinical records linked to a research register , a process known as consent for contact ( c4c ) .
there is evidence about how to engage people with mental illness in c4c , but nothing specific to older adults .
this is a priority area for research ( for example , dementia trials ) , although sign - up rates to c4c are lower than for younger populations. through this study we seek to understand these disparities .
methods this was a two - stage cross - sectional observational study .
in phase one , focus groups with service users , carers and clinicians informed a framework for clinicians to explain c4c to those on their caseload .
in phase two , clinicians explained c4c to 26 service users ( and carers where applicable ) .
these conversations were recorded , and their content was analysed .
service users and carers were then interviewed to provide further feedback on their conversations with clinicians .
a total of 31 service users , 24 carers and 13 clinical staff took part across the two phases .
results in phase one , service users and carers sought assurance of the right to refuse participation in further studies ( after joining c4c ) .
clinicians expressed concerns over legal and practical implications of ascertaining mental capacity and best interest .
in phase two , clinicians' explanations were less thorough than similar explanations given to younger adults with psychosis .
clinicians omitted details of service users' right to stipulate contact arrangements , which was significantly associated with whether service users / carers agreed to join .
common reasons for joining c4c included altruism and the chance to speak to new people .
few participants refused to join , but reasons included avoidance of stress ( potentially alleviated through the presence of a carer ) .
conclusions implementing c4c in older adults' services requires clinicians to deliver concise , simple explanations to individuals and their carers where applicable .
older adults can be suspicious of unsolicited contact ; thus , explanations must emphasise freedom to negotiate suitable contact arrangements .
hearing about research opportunities can be in the best interests of older adults , but communicating these opportunities requires a tailored approach .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 introduction patient electronic health records can improve the speed of research .
researchers can screen and identify potential research participants based upon clinical and diagnostic information .
these potential participants can then be contacted and invited to take part in studies .
this procedure accords with the uk national health service ( nhs ) constitution , which promises to inform patients of relevant research opportunities [ 1 ] .
linking a patient record to a research register cannot happen without gaining the patient 's informed consent , which is dependent on them receiving an explanation of how the register and their record may be used .
clinicians are well placed to offer such explanations since they have an existing relationship with the patient and knowledge of the content of the record .
the south london and maudsley nhs trust developed a consent for contact ( c4c ) register through which service users can be informed about upcoming research [ 2,3 ] .
information is stored securely by the local healthcare organisation as an anonymous copy of patients' clinical records .
researchers who wish to access the information must apply to de - anonymise the records of those patients who have opted - in to the register .
access to c4c is monitored by an oversight committee that includes a mixture of clinicians , service users , and research and information governance experts .
this model has been described as ' an approach that allows appropriate individuals to be identified and approached to take part , without giving researchers direct access to identifiable information before consent is obtained ' [ 4 ] .
c4c follows an opt - in model ; that is , patients must agree before joining the register .
this differentiates it from controversial healthcare data sharing schemes that have used opt - out models ; for example , care.data in the uk [ 5 ] .
clinicians working in services for people with psychosis were trained in how to explain c4c to service users using a checklist .
three items on the checklist related to whether service users agreed to join the register : that service users would not be obliged to participate in future studies ; that service users could come off the register at any time ; and that service users could stipulate how , when , and how often they wished to be contacted from the register .
one area in which recruitment to c4c has proven difficult is in older adults' mental health services .
at the time of writing ( 16 october 2014 ) only 52 % ( n = 482 ) of older adults who had been asked to join the c4c register had agreed to join , compared with 68 % ( n = 1,048 ) in services for younger adults with psychosis and 71 % ( n = 4,947 ) across the total sample of mental health service users .
recruitment to older adults' mental health research is important .
the societal and financial cost of dementia is estimated to be greater than the combined cost of heart disease , cancer , and stroke [ 6 ] .
anecdotal evidence suggests that research registers have improved recruitment to dementia research [ 7,8 ] .
however , these registers are not linked to electronic health records and therefore do not allow screening for the clinical characteristics of potential participants .
this study assimilates existing knowledge of how clinicians explain c4c , and seeks to understand the challenges of recruiting older adults and how c4c could be better explained to this population .
methods design this is a two - stage cross - sectional observational study .
the first phase involved developing training materials for clinicians with adaptations specifically to explain c4c to older adults and their carers .
the second phase involved a recorded explanatory interview about c4c between trained clinicians and service users ( with carers included as appropriate ) , followed by an independent interview between the researcher and the service user / carer .
the content of the explanatory interview was analysed , and linked to whether the service user decided to join the register , using both quantitative and qualitative methods .
setting and participants in phase one , three focus groups were held , one each with services users ( n = 5 ) , carers ( n = 5 ) , and clinical staff ( n = 7 ) .
service users and carers were recruited from memory clinics and community services in south london .
service users were included if they had a diagnosis of a dementia - related illness ; carers were included if they were a primary carer for someone with a dementia - related illness .
staff participants were recruited from two inpatient wards and one community service for people with dementia .
consent was provided by all who participated in the focus groups .
in phase two , 26 service users completed the study .
the service users were included if they were being treated by older adults' mental health services in memory clinics , outpatient services , and inpatient wards .
their age ranged from 65 to 92 ( mean = 78 years ) , 15 were women and 11 were men. of the service user participants , 18 had a carer , one participant had two carers , and seven had no carer .
in each case where the service user had a carer , the carer was also recruited .
the participants had c4c explained to them by one of six trained clinicians .
the majority of conversations took place in outpatient settings ( n = 22 ) , two in hospital and two in the home .
consent to participate was provided by all participants involved in the explanatory interview ( that is , service users , carers and clinicians ) .
the study was approved by the national research ethics service , london dulwich ( reference : 11 / lo / 1255 ) .
materials clinical , professional , and demographic information was collected .
for service users this included diagnosis and time spent in contact with mental health services and with their care team .
for carers , this included relationship with the service user and years spent as a carer .
for staff participants , this included their role and years spent in the role .
in phase one , topic guides were created for respective focus groups with staff , service users , and carers .
these guides were based on those created for people using psychosis services .
topic guides described the process of creating an electronic health record - linked research register , its implications for research , carers' involvement , mental capacity , decision - making , and when to invite people to join the register .
in phase two , clinicians received a 16 - item explanation framework for c4c ( table 1 ) , adapted from the earlier study .
the primary outcome measure was agreement to join the c4c register .
variables analysed against the primary outcome included : the mention of key items in clinicians' explanations ; whether the decision to join c4c was made by the service user , the carer , or both ; how explanations compared with explanations given by clinicians in psychosis services for younger adults ; and why people agreed or refused to join the register .

bmarked a significant difference from whether younger adults and older adults joined the register .
procedure in phase one , focus groups were conducted by a facilitator , assisted by a co - facilitator .
they were audio - recorded and later transcribed .
staff focus groups were conducted at their place of work .
service user and carer focus groups were conducted either in ward settings or appropriate community venues .
in phase two , researchers enlisted clinicians working in older adults' mental health services .
clinicians were trained using the c4c explanation framework , and were given an aide memoire of how to explain c4c to service users ( adapted following phase one ) .
clinicians then asked service users / carers on their caseload whether they would like to join c4c , and gave the service user / carer an information leaflet to keep .
consent was obtained from service users and carer ( s ) in order to record explanations received from the clinician .
immediately after the consultation , a researcher interviewed the service user and carer without the clinician present .
the researcher asked whether they had understood the explanation in response to a set of standardised questions ( these feedback interviews were also audio - recorded and transcribed ) .
data analysis phase one data from the focus groups were coded in nvivo 10 ( qsr international , melbourne , victoria , australia ) , and then thematically analysed separately for each of the participant groups .
the topic guide was used as the basis for a coding frame .
two researchers used the frame to independently analyse the data .
the frame was refined after coding all themes and subthemes into nvivo .
the data from all three focus groups were then analysed as a whole .
for phase two , the content of each consultation between clinician and service user / carer was coded into nvivo 10 against the explanation framework .
two independent researchers coded the data .
for consultations involving carers , the two coders ascertained and agreed whether the decision to join the register was made by the service user , was made by the carer , or was a joint decision .
this was based on two factors : whether the clinician addressed the service user or carer ; and the party who answered the question relating to whether they wanted to join the register ( service user or carer ) .
previous research suggested that three items on the checklist were of particular importance : the fact that future studies offered through c4c are voluntary ; that the service user can change their mind about being on c4c ; and that the service user could agree about what / when / how they wished to be contacted .
to test the hypothesis that these items were predictive of agreement to join the register , one - sided chi - squared tests ( in statistical package for the social sciences ; ibm corporation , armonk , new york , us ) were used to analyse whether sign - up rates to c4c differed according to clinicians' explanations .
for secondary analyses , two - sided chi - squared tests were used to analyse : whether the remainder of the items on the explanation framework related to agreement rates ; whether the decision to join c4c was made by the service user , the carer , or both ; and whether clinicians in older adults' services differed in their explanations to clinicians in psychosis services .
the data from the feedback interviews between service user / carer and the researcher were then analysed thematically to understand common motivations for joining c4c or not .
themes from the consultations were coded into nvivo and analysed by two independent researchers using the same process as in phase one .
results participants service user and carer focus groups each included four women and one man .
the clinician focus group included six women and one man ; six worked on inpatient wards and one in community services , and two members were senior nurses and five were psychiatrists .
sample demographics for phase two are presented in table 2 .
service users ( n = 26 ) were predominantly women ( 58 %) with a diagnosis related to alzheimer 's disease or dementia ( 73 %) .
nineteen service users ( 73 %) had carers , but there were 20 carers in total ( one service user had two carers ) .

this should be seen in terms of competing commitments and limitations on time and energy , particularly for carers .
service users and carers distinguished between joining c4c and signing up to participate in future studies .
one service user mentioned receiving nuisance telephone calls , and thus was reluctant to provide their telephone number .
" you then have an opportunity to say , sorry that is not my thing , is that right ?
( service user focus group , # 2 )" " we 're never pushed anyway , are we ? ?
( service user focus group , # 5 ) " my wife , was very keen at one stage for the brain scan but by the time the researcher came and asked us about it , she was not keen on it .
[...] i do n't see any reason why there should n't be an approach , provided that there is the option to say no . "
( carer focus group , # 2 ) " i do n't think you should be bombarded , last year we had several and you just said no , no we were doing something at the moment and that was it but i do n't like saying no but in the end your whole life is revolving round [...] appointments ...
so you 've got to look at it from the carers' point of view that they 've got a life , so to speak . "
( carer focus group , # 3 ) " i do n't want everybody knows my telephone number ...
i even have to take it off the book because they kept phoning me . "
( service user focus group , # 4 ) carers' reservations about joining c4c depended upon an acknowledgement of their commitments .
some may be in full - time employment ; others may be older and / or unable to take on extra responsibilities due to mobility problems ( also mentioned by one service user ) .
for this reason , it is often necessary to provide assurance that future research studies will account for mobility requirements : " what about the older carers though ? is there not a problem of the blind leading the blind ? that the carer might not actually be very much more capable than the person they 're caring for and i think that it a potential problem . "
( carer focus group , # 5 ) " my wife is physically weak but mentally still very strong whilst i 'm vice versa .
[...] i am physically ok but mentally weak . "
( service user focus group , # 3 ) clinician focus groups a main theme from the clinicians' focus group was the legal implications of asking service users to join c4c .
perceived problems included capacity to consent , the challenge of identifying third parties who could provide permission , and ascertaining whether joining c4c would be in service users' best interest .
" i think it would be important if they have their carers involved that they 're made aware of this approach , because we get complaints about things like that . "
( staff focus group , # 3 , inpatient ) " i ca n't think of any patients at the moment that would be able to give capacity for consent so it would be a very involved process going through that , finding out who ...
would be the best person to ask , i can see it becoming fairly complicated .
[...] i would n't be as comfortable making a best interest decision about going onto a register like this as it 's not as clearly a best interest decision in my mind , it 's in the trust 's best interest . "
( staff focus group , # 7 , community ) consultations table 1 shows how clinicians explained c4c to service users and carer ( s ) according to the explanation framework .
the majority of these consultations lasted between 3 and 6 minutes ( n = 15 ) , but ranged from as brief as 1 minute to as long as 10 minutes .
table 1 also reports the number of times service users and carers recalled each aspect of the explanation ( when feeding back to the researcher ) .
agreement to join consent for contact nineteen out of the 26 consultations resulted in service users / carers agreeing to join c4c ( 73 %) .
only one factor in the explanation framework was related to agreement rates : whether service users / carers could stipulate how , when , and how often to be contacted .
the difference was significant ( chi = 4.3 , degrees of freedom = 1 , p = 0.048 ) .
the service user was the primary decision maker in one - half of the consultations ( n = 13 ) and the carer in eight consultations .
the remaining five consultations displayed shared decision - making between service user and carer .
when the carer was the primary decision - maker , agreement to join c4c was more likely than when service users were involved in the decision ( either as primary or joint decision - maker ; n = 18 ) .
this finding did not reach conventional statistical significance ( chi = 4.3 , degrees of freedom = 1. p = 0.06 ) .
comparisons with other clinical areas clinicians' explanations differed in comparison with those given to younger adults .
clinicians within older adults' services offered simpler explanations .
they were less likely to explain that the service user could change their mind and leave c4c , or could stipulate how they would like to be contacted ( the latter of which may affect agreement rates ) .
other lesser mentioned items included the fact that c4c was voluntary , that c4c offered people the chance to participate in different types of research , that any researchers using c4c would have been regulated before use , and where the service user could go for further information .
table 3 shows how the explanations differed .

bold data are significant .
why or why not join consent for contact ; service user and carer feedback whilst providing feedback to the researchers , service users and carers both implied altruistic motives .
this was the most common reason for agreeing to join c4c and was mentioned by service users / carers in 10 interviews .
service users also described research as an opportunity for social contact .
" well if i can help somebody else . "
( service user # 11 ) " i felt very privileged to be asked .
it 's something ...
what was at the most in my mind was the feeling of being useful and contributing something to society . "
( service user # 8 ) " yes because i agree in research you can do anything to bring new insight into medicines or into the cure or into the anything .
[...] we 're happy to participate . "
( carer # 17 ) " i just automatically said yes because it 'd be someone to talk to . "
( service user # 4 ) " i like research you know it 's someone to talk to , i do n't mind that . "
( service user # 16 ) few service users in this study refused to join c4c , but amongst those who did the reasons for refusing included the avoidance of unwanted confusion or hassle .
one service user wanted more time to consider before making a decision .
one service user stated that they did not want people to access their record or were concerned about confidentiality : " i do n't want any aggravation . "
( service user # 27 ) " no i do n't do because i ca n't concentrate , you know ? ?
( service user # 23 ) " you , you do n't know whether you 're coming or going or whether these people are .
[...] genuine .
they pass the book onto somebody else to read . "
( service user # 10 ) discussion this study describes the implementation of c4c within older adults' mental health services .
focus groups indicated the importance of reassuring service users and carers that they can opt out of future studies , and of considering carers' commitments .
in reality , clinicians' explanations seldom mentioned the freedom to leave c4c , or that service users / carers could decide how and when they would like to be contacted .
the latter was related to whether they agreed to join .
given the increased prevalence of nuisance telephone calls made to older adults [ 9 ] , it makes sense that service users and carers are encouraged to join based on knowing that they control this aspect of the research contacts .
clinicians from older adults' mental health services gave simpler explanations than clinicians from younger adults' mental health services .
they omitted information on the types of research available , or on how the c4c register was governed .
such omissions are understandable ; neither concept was mentioned at length by service users or carers within focus groups , and a concise explanation may be preferable .
however , leaving out one piece of information - whether service users / carers could stipulate how , when , and how often to be contacted - was related to agreement to join the register and thus needs emphasis .
in this study we did not evaluate the effect that providing an information leaflet to service users / carers might have on understanding at a later date .
clinicians described concerns about explaining c4c where the service user lacked capacity .
these concerns are reasonable ; clinicians are charged with identifying third - party decision - makers in accordance with the mental capacity act [ 10 ] .
the nhs constitution states that the public should be informed about relevant research opportunities [ 1 ] , but clinicians may not view these as being in service users' best interests .
service users in this study cited altruism and social benefits as the most common reasons for joining c4c .
decision - making amongst people with moderate symptoms of dementia often depends on personal values and relationships [ 11 ] , so learning about research opportunities may be in service users' best interests .
conclusions implementing c4c in older adults' mental health services requires clinicians to deliver concise , simple explanations that emphasise freedom over how , when , and how often service users and carers can be contacted as well as an explanation of the framework of c4c .
the input of carers in decision - making processes may alleviate service users' anxieties , but carers' time commitments should be appreciated .
these are ways in which clinicians' explanations of c4c can be adapted to facilitate recruitment in this population .

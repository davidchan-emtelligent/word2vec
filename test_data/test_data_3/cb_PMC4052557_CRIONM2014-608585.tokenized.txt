hypersecretion of pthrp is a relatively common cause of malignancy - related hypercalcemia .
however , there is only one case report of letrozole induced hypercalcemia .
a 52 - year - old female patient was referred to our clinic because of the recent discovery of hypercalcemia ( 11.0 mg / dl ) .
the patient had a history of left breast carcinoma .
she had started a course of letrozole ( aromatase inhibitor ; 2.5 mg dose / day ) ten months earlier .
patient 's parathyroid hormone - related protein levels were normal and a bone scintigram revealed no evidence of skeletal metastasis .
other potential causes of high calcium levels were ruled out .
we recognized that , when letrozole was taken at one dose daily ( 2.5 mg ) , she had recurrent hypercalcemia .
our experience suggests that letrozole may precipitate hypercalcemia in a patient with breast cancer .
1. introduction hypersecretion of pth related peptide is a relatively common cause of malignancy - related hypercalcemia .
however , there is only one case report of letrozole induced hypercalcemia .
we report a case of hypercalcemia that appeared with letrozole treatment in a patient with breast cancer .
2. case a 52 - year - old female patient was referred to our clinic because of the recent discovery of hypercalcemia in a routine oncological control .
her oncologist , assuming that the diagnosis was most likely to be tumor - induced hypercalcemia , referred her to an endocrinologist , who undertook further tests to reveal the etiology of hypercalcemia .
the physical examination revealed her to be eupneic , blood pressure of 120 / 80 mmhg with 84 beats per second .
the patient had a history of left breast carcinoma .
our patient had undergone a left mastectomy one year previously ( estrogen - receptor positive , progesterone - receptor positive , her2 negative ) and received letrozole without any complications until hospitalization .
she remained well and achieved a complete response without an increase of carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea , ( normal value < 5 ng / ml )) or carbohydrate antigen 15 - 3 ( ca 15 - 3 , normal value : 0.5 - 29 iu / ml ) since ten months .
currently she is 1.62 m tall , weighting 62 kg , with a body mass index ( bmi ) of 23 kg / m2 and using letrozole only for the indication prescribed .
she had started a course of letrozole ten months earlier .
her family history was unremarkable .
as her hypercalcemia was mild and did not elicit any symptoms , she did not require immediate measures to correct this .
investigations to determine the cause of the hypercalcemia were performed .
initial laboratory evaluation showed hypercalcemia at 11 mg / dl , ipth as 15 pg / ml normal albumin 4.3 g / dl , and phosphorus level 3.5 mg / dl ( normal : 2.5 - 4.8 ) and creatinine 0.57 mg / dl .
24 h urinary calcium excretion was found to be 247 mg / day ( normal : 100 - 300 mg / day ) .
further blood tests demonstrated that alkaline phosphatase level was 64 u / l ( 35 - 104 ) and 25 - hydroxy vitamin d level was 22 ng / ml ( normal : 20 - 30 ) within normal limits .
a dual energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dexa ) scan was performed , which revealed mild osteopenia at the left femoral neck ( t score : - 1.6 ) .
no previous bone mineral density ( bmd ) measurement had been taken prior to this .
on other days , our patient 's serum calcium and ipth level returned to within normal range without any medications .
when we analyzed the sequence of laboratory tests , there were episodes of calcium and ipth levels with fluctuating on repeat analyses over a period of ten months between 9.5 - 11 mg / dl ( figure 1 , normal : 8.5 - 10.2 mg / dl ) and 11 - 17 pg / ml ( figure 2 , normal : 12 - 65 ) , respectively .
a workup investigation to exclude other causes of hypercalcemia was done .
she underwent an extensive evaluation including careful history , family history , physical examination , and lab work to exclude possible other causes of hypercalcemia .
parathyroid hormone related peptide was 0.28 pmol / l ( normal : 0 - 1.3 ) and bone scan was normal , thus making malignancy - related hypercalcemia unlikely .
computed tomography of thorax , neck and abdomen , and pet - bt did not reveal any malignancy .
although serum phosphorus was normal and ipth was not increased , in order to rule out hyperparathyroidism , evaluation of the parathyroid glands was performed using ultrasound and mibi scan , which were normal .
clinically , patients with fhh ( familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia ) have relative hypocalciuria and inappropriately normal or elevated ipth in the face of persistent mild hypercalcemia , none of which our patient had .
in addition to malignancy - related hypercalcemia , the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia includes calcium supplements hypervitaminosis d , milk - alkali syndrome , granulomatous diseases , medications , inflammatory and rheumatic diseases , and other endocrine disorders .
25 - hydroxy vitamin d level was not elevated ruling out hypervitaminosis d. tuberculin test , computed tomography of thorax , and bone survey were normal , thus ruling out a granulomatous process ( tuberculosis or sarcoidosis ) .
erythrocyte sedimentation rate and ana level were normal , ruling out inflammatory and rheumatic diseases .
thyroid - stimulating hormone and free thyroid hormones should be checked to help rule out hyperthyroidism .
free t4 , free t3 , and tsh were normal , ruling out hyperthyroidism , and there were no signs or symptoms suggestive of cushing disease , adrenal insufficiency , acromegaly , or pheochromocytoma .
normal prolactin level and igf - i in the age - and gender - matched normal range excluded the diagnosis of prolactinoma and acromegaly in our patient , respectively .
basal cortisol level was 19 mug / dl , and therefore we could rule out adrenal insufficiency .
an overnight dexamethasone suppression test ( dst ) was done .
after a 1 - mg dose dst , the plasma cortisol level was 0.8 mug / dl. hence , we could rule out cushing syndrome .
a 24 - hour total urinary metanephrines and fractionated catecholamines were within normal range .
she had no evidence of leukemia and lymphoma and a normal complete blood count .
serum electrophoresis was negative for monoclonal proteins .
she indicated no symptoms of peptic ulcer , and there was neither exogenous vitamin d intake nor family history of endocrinopathy .
she had no history of taking vitamin a , calcium supplements , and thiazide medication and no recent history of immobilization .
assessment of bone metabolism using markers of bone turnover could yield useful information and guide management decisions in our case .
urinary hydroxyproline level was significantly increased ( 35 mg / 24 h / m2 ; normal : 22 - 55 years - - 8.5 - 23.5 mg / 24 h / m2 ) .
because of sufficient vitamin d level , oral bisphosphonate was administered and letrozole was restarted at one - half dose ( 1.25 mg ) .
she was discharged and we closely follow up patient 's serum calcium , cea , ca 15 - 3 , and for distant metastasis .
3. discussion intensive investigations did not lead to any underlying cause for elevated serum calcium and urinary hydroxyproline level , and hypercalcemia may be explained by using letrozole treatment in our patient .
malignancy - related hypercalcemia is due to increased osteoclast activities and bone resorption caused by the increased release of various mediators from the tumor or nontumoral host cells [ 1 - 4 ] .
aromatase inhibitors ( ais ) are an important component of adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer .
letrozole works by blocking aromatase that converts androgens to estrogen [ 5 ] .
while the main source of estrogen in premenopausal women is the ovaries , the main source in postmenopausal women is the adrenals .
adrenal androgens are converted to estrogens by aromatase enzymes .
aromatase inhibitors prevent this conversion .
in postmenopausal women , ais cause relatively rapid decreases in circulating estrogen .
treatment with ais , therefore , results in bone loss due to estrogen deficiency [ 6 ] .
estrogens exert a major effect in women on bone remodeling by inhibiting interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) productions that reduces bone resorption and also controls the timing of osteoclast apoptosis .
estrogens deficiency , therefore , results in a longer life span of osteoclasts [ 6 ] .
urinary hydroxyproline level was significantly increased in our patient .
hydroxyproline is the major breakdown product of collagen , the primary protein of the bone matrix .
it is considered as clinical index of bone resorption and a major determinant of bone status .
during bone loss , collagen fibrils are broken down and hydroxyproline is excreted in the urine [ 7 ] .
serum intact pth and phosphor were not low in our patient but they were lower limits of the reference ranges .
we considered they might be mild hypercalcemia and mild deficiency of vitamin d. changes in circulating calcium concentrations alter pth secretion via a negative feedback system .
an increase in calcium binding stimulates phospholipase c and inhibits adenylate cyclase and the resultant rise in phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate and reduction in camp concentrations reduces pth release [ 8 ] .
as a result , pth secretion is inversely proportional to serum calcium concentration [ 8 ] .
in addition to this negative feedback control of pth secretion , a normal in vitamin d concentration reduces pth level .
a serum 25 - hydroxy vitamin d of 40 nmol / l ( 40 nmol / l = 16 ng / ml ) appears to represent a critical point in vitamin d metabolism at which vitamin d deficiency begins to unduly stress normal calcium homeostasis .
we showed that serum 25 - hydroxy vitamin d concentrations < 40 nmol / l ( 25 - hydroxy vitamin d level was 22 ng / ml in our case ) are associated with significantly higher serum pth [ 9 ] .
however , the secretion of pth is never fully suppressed like in our case .
on the other hand , the most common cancers associated with hypercalcemia are breast and lung cancer and multiple myeloma .
there are three major mechanisms [ 10 - 12 ] by which hypercalcemia of malignancy can occur : osteolytic metastases with local release of cytokines ( including osteoclast activating factors ) ; tumor secretion of parathyroid hormone - related protein ( pthrp ) ; and tumor production of 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin d ( calcitriol ) .
patient 's parathyroid hormone - related protein levels were normal , thus making pthrp related hypercalcemia unlikely .
one of the limitations of this report is that cytokines such as il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 1 , and vegf which are secreted by breast cancer cells were not determined and may contribute to the effects of pthrp on bone resorption [ 13 ] .
increased production of 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin d ( calcitriol ) is the cause of almost all cases of hypercalcemia in hodgkin lymphoma and approximately one - third of cases in non - hodgkin lymphoma [ 11 ] .
although 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin d - induced hypercalcemia has not been described in patients with breast cancer , we should have measured the 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin d level which was the second limitation of our report .
clinical trials have found that the ais , unlike the hormone therapy tamoxifen , increase bone fracture risk [ 14 ] .
moreover , flare hypercalcemia has a rapid onset that characteristically occurs within several days of starting therapy ; symptoms are usually short - lived and serum calcium levels return to normal when the offering agent is withdrawn [ 4 ] .
however , the temporal relation of the onset of hypercalcemia and administration of letrozole may suggest a possible role for the drug .
women receiving adjuvant ais therapy for breast cancer are at increased risk for fractures [ 14 ] , which has been shown to result in increased morbidity and mortality in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis [ 15 ] .
we recommended that patients should be initiated on bisphosphonate therapy for the prevention and treatment of osteopenia and flare hypercalcemia .
for women who have osteoporosis and are on aromatase inhibitors , bisphosphonates should help reduce fracture risk [ 16 ] .
the therapy contains a potent nitrogen containing drug , that is , alendronate , which binds hydroxyapatite crystals of bone with high affinity and inhibit bone resorption by decreasing osteoclastic activity and its growth .
after the inhibition of resorption , these agents become affixed to the bone matrix , where they reside until the remodeling begins again [ 17 ] .
reduction in bone loss during antiresorptive treatment is demonstrated by decreased excretion of hydroxyproline after antiresorptive therapy [ 18 ] .
we report a case of hypercalcemia that occurred after initiation of letrozole in a patient with breast cancer .
to our knowledge , the association of hypercalcemia and letrozole has been previously reported one time [ 4 ] .
if this occurs , letrozole might be restarted cautiously with therapeutic benefit .

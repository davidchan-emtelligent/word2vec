background in january 2016 , health authorities from zambezia province , mozambique reported the detection of some patients presenting with fever , arthralgia , and a positive result for chikungunya in an igm - based rapid diagnostic test ( rdt ) .
we initiated a study to investigate a potential chikungunya outbreak in the city of quelimane .
methods / principal findings from february to june 2016 , we conducted a cross - sectional study enrolling febrile patients attending five outpatient health units in quelimane .
serum from each patient was tested for chikv and denv , using igm and igg elisa and qrt - pcr .
patients were also tested for malaria by rdt .
entomological surveys were performed around patients' households , and we calculated the proportion of positive ovitraps and the egg density per trap .
a total of 163 patients were recruited , of which 99 ( 60.7 %) were female .
the median age was 28 years .
igm and igg anti - chikv antibodies were identified in 17 ( 10.4 %) and 103 ( 63.2 %) patients , respectively .
plaque reduction neutralization assay confirmed the presence of anti - chikv antibodies in a subset of 11 tested patients with positive igg results .
igm anti - denv antibodies were found in 1 ( 0.9 %) of 104 tested patients .
malaria was diagnosed in 35 ( 21.5 %) patients , 2 of whom were also igm - positive for chikv .
older age and lower education level were independently associated with the prevalence of igg anti - chikv antibodies .
immature forms of aedes aegypti were collected in 16 ( 20.3 %) of 79 surveyed households .
we also found that 25.0 % ( 16 / 64 ) of the traps were positive , with an average of 90.8 eggs per pallet .
conclusions our investigation demonstrated that no chikv outbreak was ongoing in quelimane ; rather , endemic transmission of the virus has been ongoing .
aedes aegypti mosquitoes are abundant , but dengue cases occurred only sporadically .
further population - based cohort studies are needed to improve our understanding of aspects related to the dynamics of arboviral transmission in mozambique , as well as in other parts of sub - saharan africa .

introduction chikungunya ( chkv ) , dengue ( denv ) and zika ( zikv ) are rapidly spreading worldwide , following the distribution of their shared main vectors , aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes [ 1 - 3 ] .
the explosive spread of zikv in south america in 2015 / 2016 led the world health organization ( who ) to declare zikv as a public health emergence of international concern on february 2016 [ 4 ] .
denv and chikv also continue to expand worldwide , with massive outbreaks reported in several regions in recent years [ 5 ] .
if we consider that the main drivers for the spread of arboviruses are the rapid and unplanned urbanization , and intensification of international trade and travel , it is expected that geographical spread of these ( and other ) arbovirus will continue [ 6 ] .
although sub - saharan africa is the known place of origin of several arboviruses , such as zikv and chikv , which were first described in this region [ 7,8 ] , and has the tropical climate favorable to the presence of aedes spp. mosquitoes , studies on arboviruses in africa are still scarce [ 9 - 11 ] .
in mozambique , the first dengue outbreak was identified in 1984 [ 12 ] .
after a long period with no reports of dengue cases in the country , in 2013 and 2014 , the ministry of health confirmed a new dengue outbreak , and surveillance for acute febrile illness suggested that dengue has become endemic in the northern region of the country [ 13,14 ] .
in addition , in 2013 , chikv infections were detected among febrile patients in southern mozambique [ 15 ]. with regard to zambezia province , no study on chikungunya has been conducted since 1957 , when kokernot et al found serological evidence of chikv [ 16 ] ; denv has never been previously investigated in this province .
information on the ecology of aedes spp. mosquitoes in mozambique is also limited .
an entomological survey conducted in the 1940s , found aedes spp. mosquitoes in several parts of the country [ 17 ] .
more recently , during the 2013 / 2014 dengue outbreak , a preliminary entomological investigation found that aedes aegypti was abundant in three northern cities in mozambique [ 18 ] , and , in 2015 , aedes albopictus was detected for the first time in the country [ 19 ] .
since the last outbreak of dengue in mozambique , the ministry of health ( moh ) made efforts to expand surveillance systems for acute febrile illnesses throughout the country .
in early 2016 , the activities were implemented in quelimane , a city located in zambezia province , by the local health authorities .
they introduced the rapid diagnostic test ( alere inc. , waltham , usa ) for chikv and during the surveillance process they reported the detection of some patients presenting with fever , arthralgia , and a positive result for chikungunya .
consequently , the mozambique national institute of health initiated an investigation to determine whether a chikungunya outbreak was ongoing in quelimane .
methods study design and site from february 24 to june 20 , 2016 , we conducted a cross - sectional study to enroll patients with acute febrile illness attending outpatient clinics at five health units in quelimane ( coalane health unit , 4 de dezembro health unit , 24 de julho health unit , 17 de setembro health unit , and quelimane provincial hospital ) .
quelimane covers an area of 117 km2 with an estimated population of 245,886 inhabitants [ 20 ] .
the city is located by the bons sinais river , 20 km from the indian ocean , and the river port is a major contributor to the local economy .
other economic activities include family farming and artisanal fishing .
about 50 % of quelimane 's population lives on less than the international indicator of poverty of us $ 2 / day [ 21 ] , in suburban neighborhoods that lack potable water supply and sanitation infrastructure .
the local climate is tropical and humid with two distinct seasons , a rainy season from november through april and a dry season from may through october .
the average annual precipitation is 1,395 mm and the average annual temperature is 25.7degreesc [ 22 ] .
inclusion criteria and enrollment the following inclusion criteria were used : age 5 years or older , with reported or measured fever ( axillary temperature >= 37.5degrees c ) for up to seven days , and presence of one or more of the following symptoms : headache , arthralgia , myalgia , retro - orbital pain and rash .
patients with a readily identifiable focus of infectious , such as pneumonia detected by chest radiography , or with suspected tuberculosis , bronchitis , pharyngitis , and cellulitis were excluded .
patients suspected to have malaria were not excluded from the study .
the investigation started in coalane health unit in february 24 , and from may 21 until june 20 , the ministry of health decided to expand the investigation to the other four health units as part of the investigation of a potential outbreak .
at coalane health unit all patients who attended the clinic during monday - friday , between 7h30 and 13h00 , and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the investigation .
at the other health units , patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were recruited in a non - random , non - systematic manner ( e.g. the same team visited the four health units on different days and hours for patient enrollment ) .
questionnaire at study enrollment , we interviewed the patients to collect clinical and demographic data using a structured questionnaire .
we provided an oral translation of the questionnaires into the local dialect for patients who did not speak portuguese .
laboratory diagnosis all patients were initially tested for malaria using a rapid diagnostic test ( rdt ) specific for plasmodium falciparum , according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( sd bioline malaria ag p.f , sd. inc.yongin - si , gyeonggi - do , south korea ) .
in order to investigate an arboviral infection , blood samples were collected at enrollment and centrifuged to separate the sera .
sera were kept refrigerated and then stored in the same day at - 20degreesc in the laboratory of quelimane provincial hospital until shipment to the virus isolation laboratory ( vil ) of the national institute of health , in maputo , where serological and molecular testing of chikv and denv were performed .
commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) were used to investigate the presence of chikv igm and igg antibodies ( euroimmun , lubeck , germany ) , as well as denv nonstructural protein 1 ( ns1 ) , and denv igm and igg antibodies ( alere inc. , waltham , usa ) .
all tests were performed following manufacturer 's instructions .
serum samples were also tested by real - time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qrt - pcr ) for simultaneous identification of chikv , denv and zikv ( trioplex , centers for disease control and prevention , atlanta , usa ) [ 23 ] .
positive control was used for both elisa and qrt - pcr reactions .
in order to increase the confidence in the chikv igg elisa results , a subset of 12 samples , of which 11 were igg positive for chikv , was sent to the institute of virology , university of bonn medical centre , bonn , germany to be tested for chikv by plaque reduction neutralization test ( prnt ) , using the virus replicon particles ( vrp ) neutralization assay .
vrp was performed on bhk - 21 cells as previously described [ 24 ] .
case definitions we defined a case of acute arboviral infection as a patient with a positive qrt - pcr test result for denv or chikv .
a patient with a positive ns1 elisa result was also considered as a case of acute denv infection .
patients in which we detected igm antibodies to denv or chikv , regardless of the presence of igg antibodies , were defined as cases of recent arboviral infection .
patients in which we detected igg antibodies to denv or chikv in absence of igm antibodies were defined as cases of previous arboviral infection .
patients with negative results for all tests were considered negative for denv or chikv .
patients presenting a positive rdt for malaria were defined as having plasmodium falciparum malaria .
entomological assessment entomological surveys were carried out in the households of the study patients who were recruited at the coalane health unit , within five days of study enrollment .
at each household , we conducted inspections for the presence of water - holding containers inside and outside the houses , and collected mosquito immatures from accumulated water , whenever they were present .
one ovitrap was placed at each household to detect oviposition and for collection of immature aedes mosquitoes .
all larvae ( from breeding sites or ovitraps ) were reared at 27 +/ - 2degreesc for up to 10 days at the provincial laboratory of entomology in quelimane , until they emerged .
then , the adult mosquitoes were killed in a cold chamber for further identification and classification of species .
the geographical coordinates of each household were obtained using a garmin trex portable gps ( global positioning system ) .
statistical analysis data were entered into excel 2013 ( microsoft inc , redmond , usa ) and redcap ( research electronic data capture - vanderbilt university , nashville , usa ) [ 25 ] databases , and analyzed using stata 12 statistical software package ( statacorp lp , college station , usa ) .
we calculated medians and interquartile ranges for quantitative variables and absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables .
kruskal wallis , pearson chi - square or fisher exact test were used as appropriate .
we set the two - tail significance level at p < 0.05 .
associations between sociodemographic factors and prevalence of chikv igg antibodies were assessed using bivariate and multivariate log - binomial regression analyses .
for this analysis , age was stratified into three groups : 5 - 19 , 20 - 39 , and >= 40 years .
associations between sociodemographic characteristics and other test results ( for denv and chikv igm ) were not assessed due to the low frequency of positive results .
we also calculated the proportion of positive ovitraps and the average number of eggs per positive trap .
geographical coordinates of patient 's households were entered in qgis 2.14 software ( open source geospatial foundation - - osgeo , beaverton , usa ) , within the openstreetmap database ( openstreetmap foundation , sutton coldfield , united kingdom ) , and analyzed to illustrate the spatial distribution of the surveyed households .
we used moran 's i index to measure spatial autocorrelation .
ethics statement this study was conducted as part of an investigation of a potential chikungunya outbreak after few patients tested positive for chikv using rdt in coalane health unit .
local authorities contacted national institute of health to investigate .
since this was part of an investigation of potential outbreak , all participants provided only verbal consent .
we only requested verbal consent because this surveillance was embedded into routine care , and we did not want to change the routine assistance being provided to these patients .
patients under 18 years old were recruited after verbal consent was provided by their parents , followed by their verbal assent .
results socio - demographics characteristics of the participants we enrolled 163 acute febrile illness patients .
median age was 28 years ( interquartile rage : 20 - 40 years ) , all patients were black , 99 ( 60.7 %) were female , 41 ( 25.2 %) were illiterate , and 94 ( 64.4 % of the 146 aged >= 18 years ) were unemployed .
no patient had a history of travel to countries where the studied arboviruses are considered endemic .
all patients lived in quelimane , although some worked in nearby districts .
frequency of chikungunya and dengue all of the 163 patients were qrt - pcr negative for chikungunya ( fig 1 ) .
igm and igg anti - chikv antibodies were detected in 17 ( 10.4 %) and 103 ( 63.2 %) patients , respectively ( 12 [ 7.4 %] patients were positive for both igm and igg ). from the subset of 12 samples tested later by prnt , all 11 igg positive samples were also prnt - positive , with titers ranging from 100 to 3,200 .
the only sample tested by prnt that was igg negative for chikv was also negative by prnt .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0192110.g001 fig 1 diagram of enrollment of study patients and performed tests .
* out of 17 patients who had a positive igm - elisa for chikv , 2 ( 11.8 %) also had a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test .
** of the 12 samples shipped to neutralization , 11 were chosen from the 103 igg anti - chikv positive by elisa .
according to our case definition for chikungunya , 17 ( 10.4 %) patients had a recent chikv infection , 91 ( 55.8 %) had a previous chikv infection , and 55 ( 33.7 %) had never been infected by chikv .
patients diagnosed with a recent or previous chikv infection were older and had a lower education level than those who were negative for chikv ( p < 0.01 ) ( table 1 ) .
the only statistically significant clinical distinction between the patients was the presence of chills , which were more common among those negative for chikv ( 92.7 %) than among those with a recent ( 82.4 %) or a previous ( 73.6 %) chikv infection ( p < 0.01 ) ( table 1 ) .
patients with laboratory evidence of chikungunya infection were detected in all health centers , except at the provincial hospital .

all of the 163 patients tested negative for denv by qrt - pcr , ns1 - elisa or igg - elisa , though one ( 0.9 %) of 104 patients tested by denv igm - elisa was positive ( fig 1 ) .
malaria was detected in 35 ( 21.5 % of 163 ) patients , and 2 of them were also positive for chikv by igm - elisa .
none of the laboratory - confirmed patients presented severe disease requiring special care or hospitalization .
factors associated with chikv infection age group and educational level were associated with previous chikv infection in both bivariate and multivariate analyses ( table 2 ) .
in the multivariate analysis , the adjusted prevalence ratios for the age groups 20 - 39 and >= 40 years , in comparison to the 5 - 19 years group , were 1.55 ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] : 1.02 - 2.34 ) and 1.89 ( 95 % ci : 1.28 - 2.83 ) , respectively .
the adjusted prevalence ratios of previous chikv infection for those with any primary level education and for illiterate patients were 1.75 ( 95 % ci : 1.36 - 2.25 ) and 1.48 ( 95 % ci : 1.12 - 1.94 ) , respectively , compared to those with at least some secondary education .

aonly for patients aged >= 18 years ( n = 146 ) entomological inspection for aedes spp. we were able to survey the household of 79 study patients , of which 57 ( 72.2 %) had a laboratory evidence of previous chikv infection .
aedes larvae were found in 16 ( 20.3 %) households .
the breeding sites were milk cans ( n = 4 ) , wells , buckets , coconut shells , tires , and washing tanks ( 2 of each ) , sewage pipe , drum , pan , and landfill ( 1 of each ) ( some households presented more than one breeding site ) ( fig 2 ) .
ovitraps were placed in 64 of the 79 surveyed households and eggs were found in 16 ( 25.0 %) of them .
the mean number of eggs per pallet in the 16 ovitraps with eggs was 90.8 .
a total of 204 adult aedes mosquitoes that emerged from larvae collected in breeding sites and ovitraps were further identified , all of them as aedes aegypti .
among them , 78 ( 38.2 %) were males and 126 ( 61.8 %) were females .
non - aedes mosquitoes were discarded .
the spatial distribution of the surveyed households is depicted in fig 3 .
no clustering pattern of the households of patients with positive chikungunya results was observed within a radius of 100 meters between neighbors ( moran i value of 0.37 ; ic95 % : - 0.84 ; 1.58 ) .

a : geographical location of mozambique on the east coast of africa and quelimane in the central region of the country ; b : map of quelimane .
in red are the households of the patients who had anti - chikv igm , igg , or both antibodies in the serum ; and in blue , the households of the patients whose serum was negative for chikungunya .
discussion our findings suggest that chikv infections are common , while denv infections occurs sporadically among febrile patients in quelimane .
in addition , we found anti - chikv igg antibodies in more than 60 % of the patients , and observed that older patients had higher antibody positivity , supporting the hypothesis that the virus has been silently circulating in the region for decades .
therefore , the investigation point to an endemic transmission of chikv in the city and suggest that there was no ongoing outbreak .
because all qrt - pcr results for chikv were negative , it is possible that other alphavirus circulating in quelimane were causing infections that cross - react with chikv serologically .
however , the test - to - test comparison between the results of the igg - elisa and the neutralization assay showed 100 % agreement , supporting chikv as the cause of the detected infections .
the presence of chikv in quelimane was not surprising , because chikungunya has been reported in neighboring countries [ 26,27 ] and the prevalence of previous chikv infections in east africa has been estimated as 72 % in kenya in 2004 [ 28 ] and 45 % in madagascar in 2009 [ 29 ] .
in mozambique , serological surveys first detected evidence of chikv infections in 1957 [ 16 ] .
more recently , cases of chikv were confirmed in maputo [ 15 ] , the capital of mozambique , ~ 1,600 km south of quelimane , in 2013 , and in cabo delgado [ 30 ] , northern mozambique , in 2014 [ 30 ] .
the frequency of 63.2 % of chikv previous infections in our patient sample is the highest ever reported in mozambique. of note , previous chikv infection was more common among those with lower education level .
assuming that educational level is a proxy for socioeconomic status , this finding suggests that poor living conditions may be a risk factor for chikv infections , as also reported in studies in indian ocean islands [ 31 ] and in malaysia [ 32 ] .
the spatial distribution of the household addresses of the patients enrolled at the coalane health unit provided an idea of how diffuse chikv occurrence was in quelimane .
we found cases in neighborhoods as far as 7.5 km from each other .
we noted that most of the patients with laboratory evidence of chikv infection resided close to the coalane health unit .
clustering of arboviral cases ( and of other infections ) near health units has been previously documented , and can be explained by ease of access [ 33 ] .
it is likely that had we been able to geocode the home address of patients enrolled in the other health units , we would have observed the same pattern of case clustering around them .
only one febrile patient presented igm anti - denv antibodies , and none was positive by igg - elisa .
if the low frequency of denv infections holds for the citywide population , we can assume that denv transmission has been very low in quelimane , and that the population is largely susceptible .
this is in contrast to reports from northern mozambique [ 13 ] where a high frequency of denv infections was recently recognized .
in one of five households investigated , immature forms of ae. aegypti were found .
there is no prior study in mozambique investigating the proportion of households containing immature aedes spp. , but surveys performed using tire traps in the capital maputo and in the northern cities of pemba , nampula and nacala found ae. aegypti larvae in 19,3 % ( 16 / 83 ) , 72.0 % ( 18 / 25 ) , 59.0 % ( 23 / 39 ) , and 64.5 % ( 20 / 31 ) , respectively [ 18 ] .
altogether , these observations suggest that this mosquito vector is widely spread throughout mozambique .
given the likely low level of denv immunity in the quelimane population , the high abundance of ae. aegypti mosquitoes in the city , and the circulation of the virus in other mozambican cities , there is potential for dengue outbreaks in this region of the country , as well as for other arboviruses for which ae. aegypti is a competent vector , such as zikv and yellow fever virus .
the emergence of denv and other arboviruses may also be facilitated by the large variety of ae. aegypti breeding sites , coupled with the poor local sanitation infrastructure .
all study patients were screened for p. falciparum infections and 21.5 % tested positive for malaria .
the most recent population - based malaria survey conducted in mozambique found 67.6 % prevalence of plasmodium falciparum infections in children from zero to five years of age from zambezia province ( data from the mozambique national institute of health , 2015 ) [ 34 ] and in different regions of the neighboring country tanzania , the frequency of malaria among febrile patients varied between 10.8 % and 46.9 % , between 2010 and 2012 [ 35 ] .
thus , in such places where malaria is hyperendemic and chikv transmission is occurring simultaneously , malaria and chikv co - infections are likely to occur , increasing the diagnostic challenge , and , consequently , the proper clinical management .
investment in laboratory capacity will be necessary to aid in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile patients .
our study has several limitations .
first , more than half of our patients were enrolled in one of the five study health units .
however , we detected patients with laboratory evidence of chikv infection in four of the health units , suggesting that chikv transmission occurs throughout quelimane .
second , we were not able to collect convalescent - phase serum , hampering detection of seroconversions and serological diagnosis of patients presenting soon after disease onset .
third , serum samples were stored at - 20 oc for 30 - 45 days in quelimane before being sent to maputo in order to perform the qrt - pcr tests , and this may have reduced our ability to detect viral rna .
lastly , although we have detected abundant ae. aegypti infestation near the study participants' households , we did not capture adult specimens to verify whether they were infected by chikv .
conclusion we conclude that no chikv outbreak was ongoing in quelimane ; rather , the new diagnostic routine implemented during acute febrile illnesses surveillance revealed that the virus has been endemically transmitted without detection by health professionals and public health authorities .
implementing laboratory tools will be critical to ensure proper differentiation between arboviral infections , malaria , and other febrile illness. ae. aegypti mosquitoes are abundant in the region , and likely serve as the main vector for chikv transmission .
their abundance also poses the population to risk for arboviral outbreaks , especially denv , for which the population likely has a low level of immunity .
further population - based cohort studies are needed to improve understanding of aspects related to the dynamics of arboviral transmission in mozambique and sub - saharan africa .

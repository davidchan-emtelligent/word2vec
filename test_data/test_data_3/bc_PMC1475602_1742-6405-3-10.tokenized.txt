background although highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) reduces mortality in the developed world , it remains undocumented in resource - poor settings .
we assessed the effect of haart on patient mortality and tuberculosis incidence rate under routine clinical care conditions in ethiopia .
the objective of this study was to assess the effect of haart on patient mortality and tuberculosis incidence rate under routine clinical care conditions in a resource - limited setting in south ethiopia .
starting in january 2003 , we followed all consecutive adult hiv infected patients who visited the hiv clinic .
since august 2003 , we treated patients with haart .
only basic laboratory services were available .
results we followed 185 patients in the pre - haart cohort and 180 patients in the haart cohort .
the mortality rate was 15.4 per 100 person - years of observation ( pyo ) in the haart group and tuberculosis incidence rate was 3.7 per 100 pyo .
in the pre - haart group , the mortality rate was 58.1 per 100 pyo and the tuberculosis incidence rate was 11.1 per 100 pyo .
haart resulted in a 65 % decline in mortality ( adjusted hazard ratio [ 95 % ci ] = 0.35 [ 0.19 - 0.63 ] ; p < 0.001 ) .
tuberculosis incidence rate was lower in the haart group ( adjusted hazard ratio [ 95 % ci ] = 0.11 [ 0.03 - 0.48 ] ; p < 0.01 ) .
most of the deaths occurred during the first three months of treatment .
conclusion haart improved survival and decreased tuberculosis incidence to a level similar to that achieved in the developed countries during the early years of haart .
however , both the mortality and the tuberculosis incidence rate were much higher in terms of absolute figures in this resource - limited setting .
attention should be paid to the early weeks of treatment when mortality is high .
the high tuberculosis incidence rate , when coupled with the improved survival , may lead to increased tuberculosis transmission .
this highlights the need for strengthening tuberculosis prevention efforts with the scale - up of treatment programmes background the survival benefit of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) in hiv infection and its impact on the incidence of opportunistic infections have been well studied in the developed world [ 1 - 3 ] .
in resource - poor settings , where such treatment was started only recently , limited data exist both on treatment results and on how to carry out such interventions [ 4 - 6 ] .
as a result , the existing treatment guidelines and recommendations are based on data from the developed world [ 7 ] .
as haart is effective in treating hiv infected patients , conducting randomized , placebo - controlled trials is unethical .
thus , the next - best method of measuring the effectiveness of haart on disease progression in new settings is cohort studies .
in this study , we present data from two cohorts of treatment - naive patients in south ethiopia .
the objective of this study was to assess the effect of haart on patient mortality and tuberculosis incidence rate under routine clinical care conditions in a resource - limited setting in south ethiopia .
results baseline characteristics we enrolled and followed 185 patients ( 90 men and 95 women ) in the pre - haart cohort and 180 ( 102 men and 78 women ) in the haart cohort .
85 patients contributed person - time for both cohorts .
at baseline , the two groups were similar for age , sex , bmi or tlc categories .
however , patients receiving haart had more advanced disease .
the follow - up period was longer in the haart group [ 50 weeks ( iqr , 21 - 68 ) vs. 19 weeks ( iqr , 10 - 34 ) .
table 1 compares the baseline characteristics of the two groups .

13 out of the 25 deaths ( 52 %) occurred at home , 11 ( 44 %) at the hospital , and in one patient place of death was not recorded .
the reasons for stopping treatment were : drug related side effects ( 3 patients ) , lack of public transport to the hospital ( 1 patient ) , afraid of swallowing tablets in front of her husband ( 1 patient ) , two patients preferred taking traditional medicine (" holy water ") instead of drugs , and no reason was given for two patients .
antiretroviral drugs prescribed 93 patients ( 52 %) used the first line treatment drugs ( d4t / 3tc / nvp ) and 48 patients ( 27 %) received d4t / 3tc / efv .
twenty - five patients ( 14 %) got zdv / 3tc / nvp while the remaining 14 patients ( 8 %) received zdv / 3tc / efv .
10 patients ( 6 %) had previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs. of these , 8 had received triple drugs and two dual therapy .
their inclusion in the analysis did not affect the results .
twenty - six patients were on concomitant antituberculosis treatment , including 8 in their intensive phase of treatment .
mortality rate 25 patients ( 14 %) died during the follow - up. the mortality rate was 15.4 per 100 pyo ( 25 deaths per 162.2 pyo ) .
after starting treatment , the median time to death was 9 weeks ( iqr , 4 - 25 ) .
none of the patients with stage ii disease died .
over half of the deaths ( 13 / 25 , 52 %) occurred in patients with stage iv disease .
tuberculosis incidence rate six patients ( 5 men and 1 woman ) developed tuberculosis during the treatment period .
the median time to the diagnosis of tuberculosis was 32 weeks ( iqr , 14 - 56 ) .
two of the patients had smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis ( ptb +) , two patients had smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis ( ptb - ) and two patients had extra pulmonary tuberculosis ( eptb ) .
the incidence rate of tuberculosis was 3.7 per 100 pyo ( 6 cases per 162.2 pyo ) .
drug side effects we observed 124 episodes of drug related side effects .
peripheral neuropathy was the most common side effect ( 48 of 124 patients , 38.7 %) followed by skin rash ( 41 / 124 , 33.1 %) and anaemia ( 11 / 124 , 8.9 %) .
two men taking an efv containing regimen developed breast enlargement .
one patient , taking a d4t - containing regimen , died of pancreatitis ( diagnosed clinically ) .
anaemia was the earliest side effect recognized , occurring at a median time of 4.4 weeks ( iqr , 4.4 - 16.6 ) followed by skin rash ( median , 4.6 weeks ; iqr , 3.6 - 13.0 ) .
two patients with anaemia needed blood transfusion .

38 out of the 47 deaths ( 81 %) occurred at home , 8 ( 17 %) at the hospital and for one patient place of death was not recorded .
the pre - haart mortality rate was 58.1 per 100 pyo ( 47 deaths per 80.9 pyo ) and the tuberculosis incidence rate was 11.1 per 100 pyo ( 9 cases per 80.9 pyo ) .
the pre - haart vs. haart cohorts : comparison of mortality and tuberculosis incidence haart resulted in a decrease of mortality ( adjusted hr [ 95 % ci ] = 0.35 ( 0.19 - 0.63 ) p < 0.001 ) .
figure 1 shows the kaplan - meier survival curves .
using cox - regression analysis adjusting for oral thrush , diarrhea , total lymphocyte count , anaemia and low body mass index shows improved survival for patients receiving haart ( figure 2 ) .
tuberculosis incidence rate was also lower in the haart group ( adjusted hr [ 95 % ci ] = 0.11 [ 0.03 - 0.48 ] ; p < 0.01 ) .
figure 3 shows kaplan meier survival plots for tuberculosis occurrence .
figure 1 kaplan - meier estimates of survival with and without haart , arba minch hospital , 2006 .
this figure shows ( i ) the higher mortality rate in the untreated group , and ( ii ) the high early mortality in both groups .
about 20 weeks after starting treatment , the mortality rate stabilized in the treated group , but in the untreated cohort there was steady increase in mortality .
the longer curve of the haart group shows the longer follow - up in the treated group .
figure 2 survival curve according to adjusted cox regression analysis shown in table 3 .
figure 3 kaplan meier estimates of tuberculosis - free survival in the two cohorts , arba minch hospital , 2006 .
this figure shows the high tuberculosis occurrence in the untreated group .
unlike the mortality rate which was highest in the early weeks , tuberculosis started at about 20 weeks after enrolment ( pre - haart ) or after starting treatment ( haart ) .
this could be because patients might have died even before being diagnosed .
additionally , it could be due to the time needed to diagnose new cases .
other factors predicting higher mortality rates among our patients were oral thrush , tlc < 1200 / ml , bmi less than 18.5 kg / m2 , anaemia , who clinical stages iii or iv and presence of prolonged diarrhea at baseline .
however , when stratified by treatment group , only low tlc and low bmi were associated with increased mortality both in the pre - haart ( bmi , p = 0.016 ; tlc , p = 0.009 ) and in the haart groups ( bmi , p = 0.017 ; tlc , p = 0.039 ) while anaemia was not associated with increased mortality in either group ( pre - haart , log - rank = 2.2 , p = 0.14 ; haart , log - rank = 2.1 , p = 0.14 ) .
tables 3 and 4 show the relative effect of selected variables on mortality and tuberculosis incidence rates .

history of tuberculosis was not associated with increased tuberculosis incidence , neither in the pre - haart group ( log - rank = 1.7 ; p = 0.19 ) nor in the haart group ( log - rank = 2.1 ; p = 0.15 ) .
discussion we found that haart decreased death and tuberculosis incidence rates in hiv infected ethiopian patients .
mortality declined by 65 % and tuberculosis incidence rate was reduced by almost 90 % .
most of the deaths in the haart cohort occurred within the first three months of therapy .
few patients experienced life - threatening drug side effects .
we did the study under routine care conditions in a typical ethiopian district hospital .
we were able to follow the patients and believe the results may be relevant to other resource - limited settings .
the use of community agents in following up the patients was not only useful to secure complete data for the research , but proved to be helpful in the routine clinical work .
however , both the mortality and the tuberculosis incidence rates are higher in this cohort than in cohorts from the developed world and there is a need to improve the treatment routines .
particular attention should be on the early weeks of treatment when mortality is high .
unfortunately , many of our patients had advanced disease at time of diagnosis .
thus , to reduce mortality , hiv patients may need to be diagnosed earlier .
treatment programmes need to work closely with voluntary testing programmes , the tuberculosis control units and with the hiv prevention efforts .
both patients and health workers should be aware that tuberculosis might occur among patients receiving haart .
patients experiencing prolonged fever before treatment are at higher risk of being diagnosed with tuberculosis .
our results are consistent with findings from the developed world when haart was introduced .
a protease inhibitor - containing haart reduced mortality by 64 % in an italian cohort [ 8 ] .
similarly , a multicenter haart trial reported a 62 % decrease in mortality among patients with advanced hiv [ 9 ] .
to our knowledge , no study has compared haart with no treatment in an african setting .
a study using virologic and immunological end points found that haart was equally effective in african patients [ 5 ] and challenged an earlier report that virological failure was more common in africans [ 10 ] .
while improved survival is encouraging news , it is lower than in the developed world .
a population based study from ethiopia showed that adult mortality rate is 11.1 per 1000 pyo [ 11 ] .
a background of high disease burden and advanced disease stage could explain the high mortality rate of 15.4 per 100 pyo among our patients .
since most of the deaths occurred within the first 12 weeks of treatment , factors associated with advanced disease or the immune reconstitution syndrome could be possible contributing causes [ 12 ] .
though we did not make any attempt to ascertain the specific causes death , we suspect undiagnosed tuberculosis either alone or as part of the immune constitution syndrome to be the cause for some of the early deaths .
this could be particularly true for the majority of deaths that occurred at home .
this highlights the need for improving the quality of patient management during the early phase of treatment , as has been shown in developed countries [ 2,13 ] .
a more recent study confirmed the high early mortality in resource - poor settings and emphasized the need for timely diagnosis and treatment [ 14 ] .
doing studies in resource - limited settings as in arba minch is difficult and adds some limits on how the study was carried out .
because of limited funds , we were not able to do cd4 tests .
even if this essential test was not done , the treatment results were good and the incomplete laboratory set - up should not be used to deny haart to patients in developing countries .
the diagnosis of tuberculosis was based on clinical , radiological or sputum examination only .
as we were not able to do tuberculosis cultures , we may have overestimated the number of tuberculosis cases diagnosed .
as haart is a lifelong treatment , we plan to follow the cohort and learn more about the long - term effects of the drugs and to learn more about drug adherence .
recent evidence shows that haart reduces the risk of tuberculosis by 70 - 90 % [ 15 - 18 ] , as shown in our study .
however , despite the decrease in tuberculosis among patients treated with haart , the rate is still high when compared to hiv - negative patients .
in south africa , the tuberculosis incidence rates in the haart and in the pre - haart cohort were 2.4 and 9.7 per 100 pyo , respectively [ 16 ] and compare well with our corresponding rates of 3.7 and 11.1 per 100 pyo. with a longer treatment period it is possible to decrease the tuberculosis incidence to about 1 per 100 pyo [ 19,20 ] .
however , the tuberculosis incidence rates from africa are still higher than 0.79 per 100 pyo reported from an italian cohort [ 18 ] .
these high tuberculosis incidence rates , when coupled with the improved survival , could lead to increased tuberculosis transmission in the community [ 18,21 ] .
thus , tuberculosis preventive strategies need to be strengthened with the rapid scale - up of haart .
some of the suggested strategies include : early introduction of haart , isoniazid ( inh ) prophylaxis and immune boosting mechanisms [ 15 ] .
in the resource - limited settings such as in south ethiopia , the inh prophylaxis seems the more possible alternative .
conclusion haart improved survival and decreased tuberculosis incidence to a level similar to that achieved in the developed countries during the early years of haart .
this relative reduction in mortality and tuberculosis is encouraging news .
however , both the mortality and the tuberculosis incidence rates were higher in this resource - limited setting .
since most of the deaths occurred during the early weeks of treatment , attention should be paid to this part of the follow - up. the high tuberculosis incidence rate , when combined with the improved survival , may lead to increased tuberculosis transmission .
this highlights the need for strengthening tuberculosis prevention efforts along with the scale - up of treatment programmes .
methods study setting arba minch hospital , located 500 km south of addis ababa , is a general hospital with basic facilities for hiv care and treatment .
the hospital has been doing hiv counselling and testing since the early 1990 's and since january 2002 , the services include basic tests to deliver antiretroviral drugs ( arvs ) and to treat opportunistic infections [ 7 ] .
in august 2003 , arba minch hospital was among the first few public hospitals to start haart in ethiopia .
the country did not have a policy on the use of arvs until july 2002 [ 22 ] .
as part of the preparation to start haart in south ethiopia , we registered and followed all consecutive hiv infected patients who visited the clinic since january 2003 .
during this pre - haart period , patients were followed and treated for opportunistic infections .
since august 2003 , we treated patients with haart .
therefore , we had two cohorts of patients : the pre - haart and the haart cohorts .
the pre - haart cohort all adult treatment - naive patients ( age > = 15 years ) with symptomatic hiv disease ( who stage ii to iv ) who had follow - up in the hiv unit of the hospital between january 2003 and august 2003 were eligible for this analysis .
at baseline , we examined patients and classified them according to the who staging [ 23 ] .
a complete blood cell count ( cbc ) was done after the clinical staging .
cd4 counts were not available .
chest x - ray and sputum for acid - fast bacilli were done when clinically indicated .
identified opportunistic diseases were treated according to the standard in the hospital .
we repeated clinical examinations and cbcs every 12 weeks and encouraged the patients to visit the clinic whenever needed .
the results of the pre - haart follow - up , including patients with stage i disease , have been reported elsewhere [ 24 ] .
the haart cohort this study included all consecutive adult patients ( age > = 15 years ) treated with triple antiretroviral drug at arba minch hospital during the period august 2003 to august 2005 .
recruitment into the treatment was based on the ethiopian and the who treatment guidelines [ 7,25 ] .
so , all hiv positive patients with who stage ii - iv were eligible to be evaluated for treatment .
in stage ii , we started treatment if the patients had a total lymphocyte count ( tlc ) of less than 1200 / mm3 .
the patient 's willingness to be treated was another condition for inclusion .
at baseline , we recorded socio - demographic , clinical and laboratory data in a standardized patient record form .
eligible patients were counselled for drug adherence and their consent was obtained before drugs were prescribed .
approved antiretroviral drugs generic combinations of stavudine ( d4t ) , lamivudine ( 3tc ) , nevirapine ( nvp ) , zidovudine ( zdv ) and efavirenz ( efv ) are approved for use in district hospitals in ethiopia [ 25 ] .
the first - line drug combination of choice ( d4t / 3tc / nvp ) was prescribed to all patients if there were no clear contraindications such as liver disease , intensive phase of antituberculosis treatment or allergy to any one of the components .
stavudine was given as 40 mg or 30 mg ( depending on body weight ) twice daily ; 3tc 150 mg twice daily ; and nvp 200 mg daily for the first two weeks and then twice daily after that .
zdv was available only in combination with 3tc and it was given at a dose of 300 mg twice daily .
the dose of efv was 600 mg daily .
efv was mainly reserved for patients in the intensive phase of antituberculosis treatment .
all drugs were given orally .
follow - up assessment following the baseline assessment , the patients were provided with more drugs on four - weekly basis .
each month , we assessed patients for drug side effects , treatment compliance , measured the body weights , and examined for new symptoms .
particular attention was given to diagnosis of tuberculosis .
cbc , liver and renal tests were measured every 12 weeks .
follow - up at community level each month , a community agent visited the patients in their homes .
these community agents had completed secondary school and had received extra training on hiv / aids .
after each visit , they reported the status of each patient .
end points the primary end point in this study was time to death .
all non - accidental deaths were considered hiv - related .
the secondary end point was time to diagnosis of tuberculosis .
we defined and classified tuberculosis according to the national tuberculosis and leprosy control manual of ethiopia [ 26 ] .
accordingly , we diagnosed smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis ( ptb +) if two or more initial sputum examinations were positive for afb , or one sputum positive for afb plus radiographic abnormalities consistent with active tb as determined by a physician .
smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis ( ptb - ) was diagnosed if at least three sputum specimens negative for afb , and radiologic abnormalities consistent with tb , and no response to a course of broad - spectrum antibiotics , and decision by a physician to treat with a full course of antituberculosis chemotherapy .
eptb refers to tb of organs other than the lungs , and diagnosis was based on strong clinical suspicion by a physician .
patients were regarded as lost to follow - up if they did not attend the hospital within the previous 90 days and the community agent did not find the patient .
we followed the patients until they died , moved out of the area or were lost to follow - up. we regarded the community agent to be the most reliable informant of outcome occurring at community level .
the data clerk at the clinic reported hospital deaths .
for the haart period , censoring time was defined as the earliest date of the following events : ( i ) if the person was alive and on treatment at the end of the study , august 9 2005 ; ( ii ) if the person was lost to follow up , the date of the last contact the patient had with the community agent ; ( iii ) if the patient was transferred to another institution , the date of transfer ; and ( iv ) if the patient stopped treatment , the last date of drug resupply plus two months .
patients in the pre - haart study were followed until they were lost , transferred , died , put on haart , or reached last date of the pre - haart follow - up ( 1 april 2004 ) whichever occurred first .
we followed pre - haart patients about 90 days into the haart period until we got information about all the patients including those still on their 12 - weekly appointment .
we calculated time - to - event from the first date of clinic visit for the pre - haart cohort and from the date haart was started for the haart cohort .
thus , the pre - haart patients who joined the haart group contributed person - time to both cohorts at different periods .
all those started on haart were considered treated irrespective of the outcome to approximate the intention - to - treat analysis of randomized trials .
statistical methods to assess the event - free survival , we used the kaplan - meier method and the log - rank test was used to test for the statistical significance .
we also used the cox - regression method to find out the effect of haart on mortality and on tuberculosis incidence rates .
we assessed the relative effect of the who clinical stages , oral thrush , diarrhoea , body mass index ( bmi ) , anaemia and total lymphocyte count ( tlc ) in predicting mortality in both the pre - haart and the haart groups .
anaemia , history of prolonged fever , history of easy fatigability , history of tuberculosis , and the who clinical stage were also assessed as possible predictors of tuberculosis .
we used the cut - off value of 18.5 kg / m2 for low bmi [ 27 ] .
since we do not have normal value for haemoglobin ( hgb ) in the study area , we used an arbitrary cut off value of 10 g / dl to define anaemia .
the cut off point for the tlc was 1200 cells / ml because of its clinical significance in starting haart [ 25 ] .
we calculated death rates as deaths per 100 person - years of observation ( pyo ) and the tuberculosis incidence rates as number of tuberculosis cases per 100 pyo .
all patients were considered to be at risk of developing tuberculosis during follow - up. we used spss for windows version 13.0 ( spss inc , chicago , usa. ) for data analysis .
all completed baseline and follow - up patient data were entered on the same day of examination or as soon as they were available .
statistical tests were considered significant if the two - sided p - value was < 0.05 .

glutathione ( gsh ) is critical to fight against oxidative stress .
its very low bioavailability limits the interest of a supplementation .
the purpose of this study was to compare the bioavailability , the effect on oxidative stress markers and the safety of a new sublingual form of gsh with two commonly used dietary supplements , n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) and oral gsh .
the study was a three - week randomized crossover trial .
20 volunteers with metabolic syndrome were enrolled .
gsh levels and several oxidative stress markers were determined at different times during each 21 - days period .
compared to oral gsh group , an increase of total and reduced gsh levels in plasma and a higher gsh / gssg ratio ( p = 0.003 ) was observed in sublingual gsh group .
after 3 weeks of administration , there was a significant increase of vitamin e level in plasma only in sublingual gsh group ( 0.83 micromol / g ; p = 0.04 ) .
our results demonstrate the superiority of a new sublingual form of gsh over the oral gsh form and nac in terms of gsh supplementation .
graphical abstract highlights * oral gsh is known for its poor bioavailability in humans .
* we compared a new sublingual gsh with nac and oral gsh on oxidative stress markers .
* on a 3 - weeks period , sublingual gsh improved the gsh / gssg ratio .
* sublingual gsh significantly increased plasmatic vitamin e levels in subjects .
* the sublingual form of gsh showed superior effects over nac and oral gsh .
keywords glutathione oral bioavailability n - acetyl cysteine oxidative stress metabolic syndrome dietary supplement nutraceuticals sublingual 1 introduction glutathione ( gsh ) is an ubiquitous water - soluble molecule found in millimolar concentration in many tissues and cells .
it is the most abundant intracellular low molecular weight peptide containing a thiol group .
this thiol function is critical for the biological activity of gsh [ 1 ] .
gsh is made from three amino acids : glycine , cysteine and glutamic acid .
this tripeptide exists in reduced ( gsh ) and oxidized ( gssg ) forms .
the relative amounts of each form determine the cellular redox status ( gsh / gssg ratio ) which is often used as a marker of antioxidative capacity of cells [ 2 ] .
gsh exhibits diverse physiological roles .
it is a potent free radical and reactive oxygen species scavenger [ 3 ] .
it reacts with various molecules ( metabolites , xenobiotics ) to form conjugates [ 4 ] .
gsh functions as a thiol buffer for many cellular proteins ( metallothioneins , thioredoxins ) .
gsh is an essential cofactor for many enzymes and it is involved in several metabolic and signaling pathways [ 5 ] .
gsh is also critical for the regeneration of other antioxidants such as tocopherols and ascorbate [ 6 ] .
there is growing evidence that dysfunctional gsh homeostasis is implicated in the etiology of several diseases .
the most well - known conditions associated with gsh depletion include neurodegenerative diseases [ 7,8 ] , pulmonary diseases [ 9 ] , liver diseases [ 10 ] , immune disorders [ 11 ] , cardiovascular diseases [ 12,13 ] as well as the aging process itself [ 14 ] .
several studies showed that plasma gsh levels decrease with age .
this deterioration of gsh homeostasis could participate , with other physiological events , in the ageing process and the appearance of age - related diseases [ 15 ] .
thus , dietary supplementation with antioxidants has been studied extensively as a potential way to prevent these diseases by countering the negative effects of oxidative stress .
researchers suggest that gsh is poorly absorbed by oral route mainly due to the action of an intestinal enzyme , the gamma - glutamyl transpeptidase ( ggt ) which degrades gsh [ 16 ] .
several studies showed that gsh supplementation in animals is effective , with benefits in the enhancement of immune function [ 17 ] ; protection against the carcinogenesis process [ 18 ] ; and improvement of the elimination of toxic chemicals [ 19 ] .
however , in humans , the effectiveness of an oral supplementation with gsh is very controversial .
a number of studies were conducted but using intravenous or nebulized gsh .
the results of studies conducted with oral gsh are mixed [ 20,21 ] .
this differential absorption of oral gsh between humans and rats / mice could be explained by a difference in quantity and activity of the intestinal ggt enzyme [ 21 ] .
although oral gsh appears to be the most convenient and safe way to take gsh , the lack of efficacy explains why this form is not often used in clinical trials .
another strategy to enhance gsh production relies on the use of n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) , a cysteine precursor .
indeed , the amino acid cysteine is the main factor limiting the synthesis of gsh .
several studies showed that nac is well absorbed by the intestine and that a supplementation with nac is effective for increasing gsh levels [ 22 ] .
however , supplementing with nac relies upon the body 's ability to synthesize glutathione from available raw materials , an ability that diminishes with age and in the presence of certain diseases , especially dysfunction of the liver .
finding a way to safely , conveniently and rapidly improve gsh levels by directly delivering the whole gsh molecule in its active reduced form would be medically compelling .
because oral gsh is enzymatically degraded in the intestine , one solution could be using a sublingual delivery system for gsh .
argument for that delivery route is that the gsh tripeptide is very well absorbed through mucosa .
it is also well - known that sublingual route allows to by - pass the effect of hepatic first - pass metabolism .
in order to address this hypothesis , a food - grade sublingual dosage form was designed .
the purpose of this study was to compare the use of this novel sublingual form of gsh with two commonly used dietary supplements , nac and oral gsh , to determine their respective interest for raising gsh levels and acting on the gsh / gssg ratio .
2 experimental section this randomized crossover study focused on the efficiency of a sublingual form and a conventional oral form of gsh compared to effects of a precursor ( nac ) taken as a baseline .
the evaluation focused on the bioavailability of both gsh forms , their respective effect on oxydative stress markers , and their tolerability .
2.1 participants the study protocol was reviewed and approved by ethics committee ( cpp ouest ) and the agence nationale de la securite du medicament ( ansm ) .
the approval code of this study is aec / b120599 - 40 .
all clinical activities were conducted at the centre hospitalier bretagne sud ( lorient , france ) , in accordance with the helsinki declaration , the french public health code concerning the biomedical researches and the rules of clinical best practice .
a total of 20 voluntary subjects ( 5 men and 15 women ) was enrolled .
baseline characteristics of the participants are given in table 1 below .
regarding the inclusion criteria , all subjects had risk factors of low - grade inflammatory state corresponding to metabolic syndrome as defined in the guidelines of the national cholesterol education program atp iii [ 23 ] : abdominal obesity associated with at least two of the following factors : impaired fasting glucose with glucose levels between 1.10 and 1.27 g / l (>= 6 and < 7 mmol / l ) , elevated blood pressure ( sbp > 130 mm hg and / or dbp > 85 mm hg ) , hypertriglyceridemia > 1.45 g / l (>= 1.65 mmol ) , ldl - c between 1.6 and 2.2 g / l ( 4.13 and 5.68 mmol / l ) , hdl - c < 0.40 g / l ( 1 mmol / l ) ( male ) and 0.50 g / l ( 1.3 mmol / l ) ( female ) .
they had a low tobacco consumption (< 5 cigarettes / day ) associated with a sedentary lifestyle .
regarding the exclusion criteria , the subjects took no anti - inflammatory or non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs .
they had no previous history of cardiovascular disease or symptomatic chronic inflammatory disease .
they did not consume antioxidant supplements or cholesterol - lowering agents .
they had a free regular diet respecting their family habits , but neither limited nor extensive ( average energy : 2500 kcal / day ) and a moderate alcohol intake (< 20 g / day ) according to the criteria of the alcohol use disorder identification test .
ggt were inferior to 35 iu / l and carbohydrate deficient transferrin ( cdt ) inferior to 3 % .
20 participants completed the study and all the data were analyzed .
2.2 products tested 2.2.1 composition of the sublingual form of glutathione this new and patented sublingual form of gsh ( sublinthion ( r )) was provided by laboratoires le stum ( larmor - plage , france ) .
one sublingual tablet contains 150 mg of reduced gsh .
the dosage was one tablet 3 times per day ( in the morning , the midday and the evening ) , to let melt under the tongue .
it represents a daily intake of 450 mg of gsh .
2.2.2 composition of the oral form of glutathione the oral form of reduced gsh was l - glutathione reduce ( r ) ( laboratoire equi - nutri , belgium ) .
one capsule contains 150 mg of gsh .
the dosage used in the study was one capsule 3 times per day providing a total intake of 450 mg of gsh .
2.2.3 composition of the precursor nac taken orally the nac drug used for this study was marketed under the brand name fluimucil ( r ) ( laboratoires zambon , france ) .
a sachet contains 200 mg of nac .
the dosage was one sachet per day .
cysteine is the limiting factor for gsh synthesis and its represents 33.6 % of the gsh molecule [ 24 ] .
providing 200 mg of cysteine ( commercial dosage ) would be sufficient for the body to theoretically synthetize de novo up to 600 mg of gsh .
2.3 study design each product was administered successively during three periods ( p1 , p2 and p3 ) of 21 days each .
a wash - out period of 14 days was observed between each product .
six combinations of administration were possible : [ nac - po - sl ] ; [ nac - sl - po ] ; [ po - sl - nac ] ; [ po - nac - sl ] ; [ sl - po - nac ] ; [ sl - nac - po ] ( po = oral form of gsh ; sl = sublingual form ) .
each combination was randomly assigned to volunteers at the inclusion , by respecting a minimum of three subjects per combination .
each period included three visits : v1 ; v2 ( v1 + 10 +/ - 2 days ) and v3 ( v2 + 10 +/ - 2 days ) .
in total , each volunteer received two preliminary visits ( pre - inclusion and inclusion ) and nine visits during the protocol .
during the pre - inclusion visit , inclusion / exclusion criteria were explained to subjects , the initial screening was done according to these criteria and the informed consent of each subject was collected .
a full medical history from each participant was obtained during the inclusion visit .
medical examinations were also conducted to check the digestive , cardiovascular and pulmonary status of the subjects .
the study was conducted according to the following plan ( fig. 1 ) .
during the test there was no change of the diet habits or the lifestyle of the participants ( diet , physical activity , smoking , etc. ) .
each patient was his own control to avoid a potential bias of a residual effect of the taking of the previous product on the following product .
table 2 presents the average characteristics for each group at the time of inclusion in the study .
2.4 markers and parameters measured blood tests were realized at the beginning ( visit 1 , before taking treatment ) , at the middle ( visit 2 ) and at the end ( visit 3 ) of every period , for all the volunteers .
at each visit , the following parameters were measured .
2.4.1 total gsh ; gsh ( reduced ) ; gssg ( oxidized ) ; ratio gsh / gssg endogenous glutathione was measured according to the following analytical protocol .
briefly , arterial blood samples were collected in lithium heparin vacutainers as an anticoagulant .
400 microl of whole blood were collected in 3.6 ml of metaphosphoric acid for the determination of total , reduced ( gsh ) and oxidized ( gssg ) glutathione .
after centrifugation ( 4000g , 10 min , 4 degreesc ) total and reduced gsh were determined enzymatically in the acidic protein - free - supernatant .
the assay of gssg was performed after having masked gsh by adding 2 - vinylpyridine to the deproteinized extract and also determined enzymatically [ 25 ] .
2.4.2 reduced thiols the rest of whole blood was centrifuged ( 4000 g , 10 min , 4 degreesc ) to separate the plasma for thiols , plasma was collected in eppendorff sterile tubes and stored at - 80 degreesc until assayed .
the measurement of thiol groups was performed using ellman 's reagent [ 26,27 ] .
briefly , 5,5 ' - dithio - bis ( 2 - nitrobenzoic acid ) 2.5 mm in 0.2 m phosphate buffer , ph 8.0 was mixed with 500 microl of sample and 750 microl of 50 mm phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 8.0 and baseline absorbance recorded at 412 nm. then , 250 microl of freshly prepared ellman 's reagent were added , reaction allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature in the dark and final absorbance measured .
thiol values were expressed in micromol / g protein using a molar absorption coefficient of 13,600 l mol - 1 cm - 1 for thiol 5,5 ' - dithio - bis ( 2 - nitrobenzoic acid ) complex .
a calibration curve was performed by sequential dilution of a 1 mm n - acetyl cysteine stock solution .
2.4.3 vitamin e : alpha and gamma tocopherols serum concentrations of tocopherols were measured by high performance liquid chromatography as previously described [ 28 ] .
2.4.4 lipid status : total cholesterol ( tc ) , ldl - c , hdl - c , triglycerides ( tg ) total cholesterol , hdl , and tg were measured by spectrophotometric methods on a routine chemistry system ( vitros fusion 5.1 , ortho clinical diagnostics , usa ) .
serum ldl - cholesterol was calculated using the following friedewald formula [ 29 ]:[ ldl - c ]=[ tc ] - [ hdl - c ] - 0,20 *[ tg ]( expresseding / l ) 2.5 statistical analysis the individual characteristics ( age , sex ) and all the parameters at d0 are described with regard to the mean and the standard deviation .
the conditions of normality are verified in advance by the shapiro - wilk test , comparability of groups is performed by student 's t - test. from a value of sigma estimated on the basis of a previous pilot study ( internal documents ) , we used a sample size of 20 volunteers , who were included .
to search a " carry - over " effect ( i.e. a residual effect of a product of a previous period over the next period ) , the measures obtained at the end of 3 treatment periods ( p1 - v3 ; p2 - v3 ; p3 - v3 ) were compared by using a mixed linear regression model for each of three treatments .
the statistical analysis was performed with the sas software version 9.3 ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc ) .
p <= 0.05 was taken as the level of statistical significance for all procedures .
2.6 outcomes the purpose of the study was to compare the bioavailability of each product , the effects of the different forms of glutathione on markers of oxidative stress and the safety of each product .
2.6.1 bioavailability evaluation the bioavailability of each product was measured by comparing respective total glutathione ( gsht ) , reduced glutathione ( gsh ) and oxidized glutathione ( gssg ) indices .
the measurements were made by comparing these markers between the first and second visit ( v2 - v1 ) and between the first and last visit ( v3 - v1 ) .
2.6.2 evaluation of the antioxidant efficacy the primary outcome was the ratio between reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione expressed as gsh / gssg .
the gsh / gssg ratios were compared at the end of each period by using a mixed linear regression model .
the equation is the following one :[ primaryoutcome ( gsh / gssg )=( a0 + ai )+ a1 * treatment + a2 * period + a3 *( gsh / gsshratioatvisit1 ) in the equation above , ai ( a index i ) represents the individual variability , to which the standard intercept ( a0 ) is added .
to evaluate the effect of each treatment , the model is adjusted to the value of the primary outcome at the start of each treatment period ( p1 - v1 ; p2 - v1 ; p3 - v1 ) .
the model is also adjusted to the treatment period ( 3 periods for each subject corresponding to the successive intake of the 3 treatments ) .
this adjustment allows to take into consideration a potential effect of time on the primary outcome [ 30 ] .
the absence of " carry - over " effect , whatever the period and the product considered , allowed us to apply the above equation to all parameters studied .
the secondary outcomes contributed to estimate the oxidative stress status of the volunteers : plasma reduced thiols , vitamin e , total cholesterol , hdl - c , ldl - c and plasma triglycerides were also measured .
2.6.3 tolerance of the treatments the tolerance of the treatments was analyzed by evaluating changes in plasma levels of crpus ( ultra - sensitive c - reactive protein ) and liver function tests ( alanine amino transferase ( alat ) , aspartate amino transferase ( asat ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ap ) and ggt between the first visit ( v1 ) and the last visit ( v3 ) for each treatment ) .
the values did not have to exceed the superior limit of the range of normality ( n ) : alat ( n : 30 - 50 iu / l ) ; asat ( n : 15 - 41 iu / l ) ; ap ( n : 40 - 150 iu / l ) ; ggt ( n : 5 - 50 iu / l ) .
the percentage increase of these biological data was analyzed using the wilcoxon test of signed rank .
the evaluation of safety also included the monitoring of any clinical adverse events as well as vital signs ( heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory frequency , body temperature ) .
the general appearance was checked by a physical examination of each subject at every visit ( v1 , v2 , v3 ) .
3 results 3.1 bioavailability the comparative analysis of bioavailability between oral gsh and the sublingual form is summarized in tables 3 and 4 .
the potential problem in crossover design is that carryover effects may bias the direct effects of the treatment .
regardless of the period and the treatment , no significant carryover effect was observed ( p > 0.75 ) .
therefore , the data were pooled for a given treatment ( sl , po ) to analyze the results ( n = 20 for each treatment ) .
3.2 effects of the treatments 3.2.1 primary outcome ( gsh / gssg ) the comparison of the effect of each treatment on the gsh / gssg ratio was performed after pooling the results as there was no carryover effect .
the evolution of the gsh / gssg ratio for the 3 groups ( nac , oral gsh or sublingual gsh ) is reported in table 5 .
a comparative analysis was performed : first by taking nac as reference ( comparison nac vs oral gsh and nac vs sublingual gsh ) and second by comparing the oral gsh to the sublingual gsh form .
in the oral gsh group , the gsh / gssg ratio was low at each time and significantly different at v3 ( p = 0.03 ) compared to the nac group .
in the sublingual gsh group , this ratio tended to be high at each time and was statistically significant at v2 ( p = 0.03 ) compared to the nac group .
compared to the oral gsh group , the sublingual group exhibited a higher gsh / gssg ratio , in particular at v3 ( p = 0.02 ) .
3.2.2 secondary outcomes 3.2.2.1 reduced thiols results are detailed in the table 6 .
reduced thiols levels are expressed on an albumin gram basis .
an intragroup analysis was performed : in the nac group , a significant increase was observed at v2 compared to baseline ( 0.12 micromol / g , p = 0.04 ) .
in the oral gsh group , the level of reduced thiols increased significantly at v2 and v3 compared to baseline ( respectively 0.14 micromol / g ; p = 0.004 and 0.13 micromol / g , p = 0.001 ) .
for sublingual gsh , this level increased only in the first period ( 0.14 micromol / g , p = 0.01 ) .
no significant differences were observed between the 3 groups .
3.2.2.2 vitamin e the effects of the 3 treatments on the levels of vitamin e in plasma were also examined ( table 7 ) .
after 3 weeks of administration , there was a significant increase of vitamin e level in plasma only in the sublingual gsh group ( 0.83 micromol / g ; p = 0.04 ) .
no significant differences were observed between the 3 groups or for the oral gsh and nac arms .
3.2.2.3 lipid status results are detailed in the table 8 .
after performing an intragroup analysis , no changes were observed at any time points or in either groups , whatever the lipid biomarker monitored ( total cholesterol , hdl - c , ldl - c , tg ) .
when taking the lipid values of the nac group as baseline , total cholesterol and ldl - c were slightly decreased at v3 in both oral and sublingual gsh groups .
however , it was not statistically significant .
in the meantime , hdl - c level decreased in the oral gsh group and increased in the sublingual gsh group but these differences were not significant .
however , compared to the oral gsh group , a significant increase of hdl - c level was observed in the sublingual gsh group ( 0.039 +/ - 0.013 , p = 0.0043 ) .
3.2.3 adverse effects values of the plasma levels of crpus and liver function markers at each visit for each treatment arm were reported in table 9 .
whatever the marker ( hepatic status or ultra - sensitive crp ) , no significant changes were reported .
for all the markers monitored , values were always within the range of normality .
all the dosage forms were very well tolerated and no adverse events were reported by the participants , whatever the treatment used .
4 discussion conducting such a study is always difficult , as the supplementation product ( gsh ) is also produced endogenously by the body .
furthermore , like most of our antioxidants , it is tightly regulated .
whatever the treatment considered , our results sometimes show high standard deviations .
this can be explained by the heterogeneity of the studied population .
indeed , the main inclusion criterion was the presence of metabolic syndrome .
it is not a strictly defined disease entity , but a convergence of at least 3 risk factors .
as each patient may have a number and / or a combination of different risk factors while meeting the strict definition of metabolic syndrome , this heterogeneity was expected .
otherwise , it corresponds to the remaining diversity commonly encountered in a standard population .
therefore , bias in the recruitment of the volunteers can be excluded for this study .
oral administration of gsh is not considered optimal due to its very poor bioavailability and rapid oxidation .
other indirect means have been developed to circumvent this problem .
one of them is the oral delivery of nac as a source of cysteine .
indeed , after its intestinal absorption , nac undergoes first - pass metabolism in the liver where it is deacetylated to cysteine .
then , unless there is hepatic dysfunction , the hepatic tissue synthetizes de novo gsh from this cysteine .
this gsh replenishes the hepatic stock before being released in the plasma [ 22,31 ] .
consequently , we considered nac as the reference treatment for this study .
regarding the bioavailability of oral gsh , our data are consistent with previous results from a study of oral gsh supplementation ( 1 g / day for 4 weeks ) that showed a non - significant decrease of total and reduced gsh indices [ 20 ] .
this results in an overall decrease of the gsh / gssg ratio .
high levels of gssg are indicative of periods of oxidative stress .
the ratio gsh / gssg is an important marker of redox status .
the restoration of a normal redox equilibrium results in an increase in gsh / gssg ratio .
in our study , the gsh / gssg ratios in the nac and sublingual gsh arms are significantly higher than oral gsh one .
it seems that the sublingual gsh form is more useful than the oral form to improve this balance .
one possible explanation of these results is that oral gsh undergoes partial hydrolysis and oxidation during the digestive process .
therefore , the liver has to synthetize de novo gsh from precursors. with the sublingual dosage form , the gsh is directly assimilated through the buccal mucosa and avoid the hepatic first - pass effect .
our results suggest that the sublingual gsh form exhibits a better bioavailability than the oral gsh .
this increase of the gsh / gssg ratio may suggest a reduction in oxidative stress resulting from the sublingual gsh supplementation .
therefore , we tried to determine whether the improved bioavailability of the sublingual form of gsh resulted in an effect on oxidative stress markers .
the outcome measures were extended to reduced thiols and vitamin e. some evidence suggest that gsh is critical for the recycling of antioxidants like vitamin c [ 32,33 ] and consequently , vitamin e [ 34 ] , which is an important inhibitor of the lipid peroxidation .
our findings are consistent with these previous observations .
we found that there was a significant increase in the plasma vitamin e level following the supplementation with sublingual gsh .
considering that gsh forms were given at physiological dose to subjects , obtaining such significant differences between these two dosage forms , either on the primary endpoint or on several secondary endpoints , reinforces the legitimacy of the sublingual form over the oral gsh .
it would be interesting to conduct the same study on a population with greater gsh deficiency or high oxidative stress ( smokers , type 2 diabetics , hiv - positive subjects ) .
larger differences between the two forms of gsh on the gsh / gssg ratio or on other markers would likely be expected .
given the results observed between nac and sublingual gsh , it seems useful to advise this new sublingual form for the same indications as those described for the nac in the literature [ 35 ] .
the recommendation of this product should be preferentially based on clinical observation and inventory of risk factors rather than based on costly and variable blood tests .
regarding the duration of treatment necessary to obtain an antioxidative effect , 21 days of treatment were sufficient to achieve significant results , mostly for the nac and the sublingual gsh form .
during these 3 weeks , no adverse effects were reported .
however , the overall duration of treatment must take into account the importance and the multiplicity of risk factors .
5 conclusions conducted on a population at risk with metabolic syndrome , the objective of this study was to assess the bioavailability , the effect on biomarkers , and the short - term safety of 2 dosage forms of glutathione , the cornerstone of antioxidant defenses .
overall , our results demonstrate the significant superiority of a new sublingual form of gsh over the oral form , both in terms of bioavailability and positive effects on oxidative stress .
compared to nac , better effects of the sublingual form of gsh were also observed .
metabolic syndrome increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes .
because of the impact of the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in the promotion and the development of the metabolic syndrome , it is important to establish a preventive strategy and fight against oxidative stress .
in addition to the usual dietary recommendations , it is reasonable to propose to concerned people a product whose interest is demonstrated .
this new sublingual formulation of gsh meets this requirement .
it should find its place in the primary and secondary prevention strategies .

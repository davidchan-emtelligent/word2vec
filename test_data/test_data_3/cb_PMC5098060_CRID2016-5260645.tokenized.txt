hemifacial hyperplasia is a rare congenital malformation characterized by noticeable unilateral excess development of hard and soft tissues of the face .
asymmetry in congenital hemifacial hyperplasia ( chh ) is usually evident at birth and accentuated at the age of puberty .
the affected side grows exponentially as compared to the unaffected side .
multiple tissue involvement has resulted due to etiological heterogeneity like heredity , chromosomal abnormalities , altered intrauterine environment , and endocrine dysfunctions .
as this lesion is rarely seen in our routine clinical practice , we present a case of hemifacial hyperplasia with reported orofacial features that supplement existing clinical knowledge .
this paper also adds knowledge to the readers regarding detailed investigation procedures which has complemented our diagnosis .
further emphasis has been placed on periodic approach to its diagnosis and multidisciplinary management following correct diagnosis .
1. introduction congenital hemifacial hyperplasia ( chh ) is a rare developmental malformation exhibited by a unilateral enlargement of hard and soft tissues of the face .
this asymmetrical overgrowth traditionally referred to as hypertrophy is more accurately termed as hyperplasia as this pathologic process involves abnormal proliferation of cells ( hyperplasia ) rather than growth of individual existing cells ( hypertrophy ) [ 1 ] .
synonymously , this condition has been termed as facial hemihyperplasia , partial / unilateral gigantism , hemimacrosomia , and hemifacial hyperplasia [ 2 ] .
congenital hemifacial hyperplasia was first noted by meckel jf in 1822 and , later , first case was reported by wagner in 1839 [ 3 ] .
later , gesell described this lesion as being " essentially a developmental anomaly antedating birth and arising in partial deflection of the normal process of birth " [ 4 ] .
hyperplasia presents as an isolated finding or in association with several syndromes like beckwith wiedemann syndrome , proteus syndrome , russell silver syndrome , and sotos syndrome .
rowe [ 5 ] proposed a classification of hemihyperplasia based on its anatomic location as ( 1 ) simple hemihyperplasia ( single limb ) , ( 2 ) complex hemihyperplasia ( one - half of the body ) , and ( 3 ) facial hemihyperplasia ( one side of the face ) .
depending on the soft tissue involvement , hemifacial hyperplasia can be broadly classified as ( 1 ) true hemifacial hyperplasia ( increased growth of one or more tissues on one side of the face ) and ( 2 ) partial hemifacial hyperplasia ( increased growth limited to one structure only ) [ 6 ] .
we present an interesting case of true congenital hemifacial hyperplasia ( true chh ) in a 39 - year - old male with unique orofacial manifestations , radiographic findings , and differential diagnosis with treatment in detail to supplement the existing knowledge .
2. case presentation a thirty - nine - year - old male patient reported to the department of oral medicine and radiology with a chief complaint of asymptomatic swelling in his right cheek region since birth .
the swelling gradually progressed to the present size and ceased to grow after 18 yrs of age .
family history was noncontributory .
the patient was well oriented with stable vital signs .
on extraoral examination , facial asymmetry with diffuse swelling was evident on the right side of the face measuring about 5 x 6 cm. the swelling extended superiorly to upper canthus of right eye , inferiorly up to 1 cm below the lower border of mandible , anteriorly until nasolabial fold , and posteriorly till the tragus of the ear [ figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b )] .
nose and chin were deviated with an observable arc shaped facial midlines ( nasion - gnathion ) .
enlarged soft tissue mass was observed involving maxilla , mandible , and zygoma on the affected side .
on palpation swelling was nontender , hard in consistency , and noncompressible .
skin over the swelling was normal with no evidence of secondary changes .
patient showed mild tenderness on the right condylar region .
restricted temporomandibular joint ( tmj ) movements and incompetent lips with marked enlargement of both upper and lower lips on the right side were evident .
there was no evidence of regional lymphadenopathy .
on intraoral examination , there was restricted mouth opening with a maximum interincisal distance measuring about 1 cm only .
enlarged right maxillary and mandibular alveolar arches , upper and lower labial mucosa , and buccal mucosa were observed .
dorsum surface of the tongue appeared engorged with polypoid excrescences (" multiple pebbly " appearance ) representing enlargement of fungiform papillae [ figure 2 ] .
distinct tooth size discrepancy was evident between right and left sides .
maxillary and mandibular right teeth increased in labiolingual , mesiodistal , and buccopalatal dimensions [ figures 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b )] .
midline shift and a downward canting of the occlusal plane were noted .
orthopantomogram ( opg ) [ figure 4 ] revealed an obvious diffuse enlargement of right side coronoid , condylar processes , lower border of mandible , inferior alveolar canal , jaws , and teeth ( macrodontia ) .
computerized tomography ( ct ) [ figure 5 ] scan of the face revealed enlarged right petrous part of temporal bone , pituitary fossa , maxilla , mandible , condyle , zygoma , and cranial bones .
deviation of nasal bone and chin was observed towards left side due to an obvious enlargement of overlying soft tissues on right side of the face .
bone scintigraphy [ figure 6 ] revealed hyperactivity and excess bone growth on right side maxilla and mandible .
a physician consultation was arranged and no systemic abnormality was noted .
routine blood investigations were also under normal limits .
based on the clinicopathological findings , a final diagnosis of congenital hemifacial hyperplasia ( chh ) was made .
the patient refused to undergo extensive surgical procedures as the lesion was asymptomatic .
follow - up with this patient exhibited good prognosis and no evidence of malignant changes .
3. discussion hemifacial hyperplasia ( hfh ) is a rare developmental anomaly exhibiting asymmetric facial growth by unilateral localized enlargement of all tissues in the affected area that is facial bones , teeth , and soft tissues [ 5 ] .
the degree of anatomical variations appears variable from mild to most severe cases .
hence limited cases of hemifacial hyperplasia are documented .
the prevalence of hemifacial hyperplasia is approximately 1 in 86,000 live births [ 1 , 3 ] .
women are commonly affected compared to men with right side predominantly affected as in the present case .
the affected side tissue growth occurs in an exponential manner in comparison to the uninvolved side resulting in facial asymmetry following a skeletal arrest .
this results in a relative asymmetry that is taken forward throughout the growth until adulthood [ 7 ] .
various etiological factors like heredity , chromosomal abnormalities , altered intrauterine development , endocrine dysfunction , and vascular and lymphatic abnormalities remain implicated in this lesion .
however , no single factor is directly related to the occurrence of this disorder [ 8 ]. of importance , gesell suggested this condition due to the process of twinning mechanism .
according to noe and bergman , mitochondrial damage overripened one - half of the fertilized egg resulting in excess generation of cells [ 9 ] .
recently , literature suggests that hemifacial hyperplasia may be more aptly attributed to defect in neural crest cell differentiation and migration .
in this theory , pollock and colleagues stated that neural fold appears to be larger on one side compared to the other part of structure .
this enlarged neural fold produces increased number of neural crest cells throughout prenatal and postnatal periods of life owing to unilateral overgrowth of crest cell derived bone , teeth , and soft tissue on affected side of the face .
based on the current knowledge , yoshimoto et al. stated that basic fibroblast growth factor ( bfgf ) along with its receptor stimulated osteoblastic differentiation on the affected side as compared to the uninvolved part of the face [ 10 ] .
limited cases of hemifacial hyperplasia have been documented .
these patients present with dental , skeletal , and soft tissues of the affected portion of the face [ 11 ] .
dental abnormalities of deciduous teeth are less common and often overlooked .
variations in size , shape of crowns and root of teeth , rate of development ( precocious development ) , and number of teeth are seen .
tooth crown and root size / shape appear distorted .
permanent canines , bicuspids , and first molars are involved most frequently [ 12 , 13 ]. of note , our case presented with marked dental abnormalities like precocious tooth development and macrodontia .
skeletal development of cranial bones ( frontal , parietal , temporal , and skull base ) , zygoma , maxilla , and mandible is accentuated .
midline shift and altered occlusion with deviated occlusal plane are noticed .
accelerated jaw growth frequently results in exostoses with malocclusion [ 14 , 15 ] .
soft tissue abnormalities include gingival and labial mucosal thickening .
large soft tissue excrescences are evident predominantly on the dorsum of tongue (" pebbly ") and buccal mucosa (" lipoma - like growth ") .
tongue exhibits enlargement of fungiform papillae unilaterally .
lower lip is twice commonly affected than upper lip .
involvement of upper lip causes displacement of philtrum to the uninvolved side of the face .
palate also shows an arch shaped deformity ipsilaterally [ 16 , 17 ] .
all these skeletal features and soft tissue abnormalities were evident in the above case .
radiographically , this lesion presents with hard tissue and soft tissue enlargement on the affected side .
these patients exhibit premature development and altered crown and root size / shape discrepancy along with a downward slant of the occlusal plane [ 18 , 19 ] .
our case is consistent with the previous findings .
differential diagnosis of facial hemihyperplasia includes fibrous dysplasia , dyschondroplasia , congenital lymph edema , arteriovenous aneurysm , hemangioma , lymphangioma , neurofibromatosis , and malignant lesions ( osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma ) .
these clinical conditions can be clearly differentiated from chh based on specific radiographs and laboratory and clinical findings that supplemented our case diagnosis [ 20 ] .
treatment ideally is not indicated for congenital hemifacial hyperplasia ( chh ) unless cosmetic considerations are involved .
procedures are deferred until physiological growth ceases .
an integrated multidisciplinary approach in the field of dentistry is essential in providing an asymptomatic treatment .
treatment options may include soft tissue debulking of masticatory and subcutaneous tissues , preservation of neuromuscular functions , and reconstructive procedures ( osteotomy / orthognathic surgical procedure with / without orthodontic treatment ) postoperatively .
till date , previous literature survey indicated no evidence of malignant transformation .
4. conclusion a true case of congenital hemifacial hyperplasia ( chh ) is rare and unfamiliar to a clinician due to underreported number of cases in literature .
this article presents a unique case report of a typical case of chh with a detailed emphasis on diagnostic criteria ( clinical and radiographic appearance ) thus emphasizing to all the readers its importance .
treatment planning in such patients is tremendously difficult due to the involvement of multiple major surgeries for the removal of excessively grown hard and soft tissues .
further cases need to be brought into documentation so as to have a clear understanding regarding various aspects of this disease .

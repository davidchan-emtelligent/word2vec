despite a central regulation of body temperature in mammals , small changes in temperature can have substantial effects .
for example , increases in brain temperature can in rare cases even induce epileptic seizures [ 2 ] .
at the level of single cells , temperature affects ion channels : an increase in temperature predominantly speeds up their opening and closing rates and increases their maximal conductances .
while the temperature dependence of nervous system function is widely acknowledged , we currently still lack a full understanding of the effects of temperature on local circuits .
here , we investigate the impact of temperature on spike timing precision and network synchronisation .
it is known that properties of individual ion channel types can modify spiking regularity of single neurons and network synchronisation .
to study temperature - induced changes of these observables , multiple ion channels have to be considered simultaneously .
our approach is based on analytical simplification and numerical continuation .
spike jitter is analysed in temperature - dependent conductance - based models with ion channel stochasticity .
below threshold , the dynamics are appropriately described by a coloured noise escape problem , and , above threshold , by a phase - oscillator description .
we show that for common , physiological parameter combinations , an increase in temperature reduces spike jitter .
below threshold , this can be explained by a temperature - induced redistribution of current noise power to higher frequencies , which are filtered out by the membrane impedance .
above threshold , the faster dynamics at elevated temperatures alter the ion channels' phase response curves and hence their phase susceptibility .
these results are interpreted in the context of network synchronisation by showing the effect of temperature on the entrainment region of deterministic models .

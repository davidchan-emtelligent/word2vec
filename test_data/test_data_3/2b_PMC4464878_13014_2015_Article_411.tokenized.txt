background small cell carcinoma of the rectum is a rare neoplasm with scant literature to guide treatment .
we used the surveillance epidemiology and end results ( seer ) database to investigate the role of radiation therapy in the treatment of this cancer .
methods the seer database ( national cancer institute ) was queried for locoregional cases of small cell rectal cancer .
years of diagnosis were limited to 1988 - 2010 ( most recent available ) to reduce variability in staging criteria or longitudinal changes in surgery and radiation techniques .
two month conditional survival was applied to minimize bias by excluding patients who did not survive long enough to receive cancer - directed therapy .
patient demographics between the rt and no _ rt groups were compared using pearson chi - square tests .
overall survival was compared between patients who received radiotherapy ( rt , n = 43 ) and those who did not ( no _ rt , n = 28 ) using the kaplan - meier method .
multivariate cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate important covariates .
results median survival was significantly longer for patients who received radiation compared to those who were not treated with radiation ; 26 mo vs. 8 mo , respectively ( log - rank p = 0.009 ) .
we also noted a higher 1 - year overall survival rate for those who received radiation ( 71.1 % vs. 37.8 %) .
unadjusted hazard ratio for death ( hr ) was 0.495 with the use of radiation ( 95 % ci 0.286 - 0.858 ) .
among surgery , radiotherapy , sex and age at diagnosis , radiation therapy was the only significant factor for overall survival with a multivariate hr for death of 0.393 ( 95 % ci 0.206 - 0.750 , p = 0.005 ) .
conclusions using seer data , we have identified a significant survival advantage with the use of radiation therapy in the setting of rectal small cell carcinoma .
limitations of the seer data apply to this study , particularly the lack of information on chemotherapy usage .
our findings strongly support the use of radiation therapy for patients with locoregional small cell rectal cancer .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background neuroendocrine neoplasias ( nen ) arise from neural and endocrine cell types and can occur all throughout the body .
nen are broadly grouped into pulmonary and extrapulmonary primary sites and encompass a heterogeneous class of malignancies that vary widely in their clinical presentations and characteristics .
the number of different iterations of nen that arise as a function of primary site , grade and clinical presentation compounded by their relative infrequency has made clinical trial execution difficult and slowed the pace at which outcomes can be improved for the many subtypes [ 1 - 3 ] .
grade i / ii nen are by definition neuroendocrine tumors ( net ) .
some of the literature use the term net to refer more broadly to nen , which encompass all grades of neuroendocrine neoplasms .
the more aggressive and poorly differentiated grade iii neuroendrocrine carcinomas ( nec ) are further subdivided into small cell carcinomas ( scc ) and large cell carcinomas ( lcc ) .
surveillance , epidemiology and end results ( seer ) studies examining nen epidemiology revealed an incidence rate of 5.25 and 5.76 per 100,000 for the 2000 - 2004 and 2003 - 2007 periods , respectively [ 4,5 ] .
both of these studies note a greater than four - fold increase in the incidence of nen for the data available since 1973 , which the authors of the studies attribute to improved diagnostic capabilities and greater disease awareness .
patients with well or moderately differentiated diagnoses had median survival times of 124 and 64 months , respectively , while those diagnosed with poorly differentiated tumors ( such as scc or lcc ) had a 10 month median survival time [ 5 ] .
the stark difference between mortality rates of low and high grade nen highlights the importance of establishing more accurate and consistent grading criteria to guide future treatments , distinguish between indolent and aggressive subtypes and provide meaningful prognostic information .
extrapulmonary gi nen as a group make up 61 % of all nen diagnoses , with the rectum being the most common site ( 17.7 %) , followed by the small intestines ( 17.3 %) and colon ( 10.1 %) [ 4 ] .
amongst the more aggressive and rare gi scc , the most common site of incidence is the esophagus ( 53 %) followed by the colon ( 13 %) , stomach ( 11 %) , gall bladder ( 8.4 %) and rectum ( 7.3 %) [ 4,6 ] .
scc of the rectum are aggressive and rare tumors compromising less than 1 % of all gi neoplasms , with reported median survival ranging from 7 to 11 months and estimated five year survival rates of 8 - 15 % [ 5,7 - 12 ] .
due to its low incidence , there is a paucity of literature to guide treatment and we are currently limited to case reports and small retrospective studies .
treatments for extrapulmonary gi scc have been guided by extrapolating from treatment modalities used for small cell lung cancer [ 2,9,13 ] .
nonetheless , in the published literature there was tremendous variation in treatment approaches , outcomes and follow - up information .
given the scarcity of literature and rare incidence of rectal scc , we performed a seer database analysis to understand the potential role of radiotherapy in the treatment of this malignancy .
methods the seer database ( national cancer institute ) was queried with seer * stat8.1.2 software for rectal small cell cancer cases .
in order to exclude patients with distant metastatic disease , we restricted the search to locoregional cases by using the " seer historic stage a " variable .
years of diagnosis were restricted to 1988 - 2010 , in order to reduce bias or error due to variability in staging / grading criteria and longitudinal changes in chemotherapy , surgery or radiation treatment techniques .
radiation in the rt group was limited to external beam radiation therapy for all cases .
surgical procedures were grouped based on the extent of resection .
a two month conditional survival was applied to minimize bias by excluding patients who did not survive long enough to receive cancer - directed therapy .
overall survival was compared between patients who received radiation ( rt ) and those who did not ( no _ rt ) using the kaplan - meier method .
multivariate cox proportional hazards statistical modeling was used to evaluate important covariates , with ajcc stage as a stratification variable .
patient demographics between the rt and no _ rt groups were compared using pearson chi - square tests .
results the seer database included 71 patients that fit our study criteria .
this patient cohort had 43 patients treated with radiation ( rt group ) and 28 patients without radiation ( no _ rt group ) .
there were no significant difference between the rt and no _ rt groups when considering demographic factors such as sex , race and stage ( table 1 ) .
there were also no statistical differences between patient location , marital status and year of diagnosis ( data not shown ) .
we did note a statistically significant difference in the sequence number in which rectal scc was diagnosed ; patients in the no _ rt arm had a significant portion of rectal scc diagnoses following another malignancy. between the two arms of the study , the rt group received surgery 32.6 % of the time , while the no _ rt group received surgery 50 % of the time , but this was not statistically significant with a p - value of 0.142 .
chemotherapy regimen was not available through the seer database .

overall survival between the two groups differed significantly , with median survival of 26 months for the rt group versus 8 months for the no _ rt group ( p = 0.009 ) ( figure 1 ) .
patients who were treated with radiation had a 1 year overall survival rate of 71.1 % compared to 37.8 % for patients who were not treated with radiation .
the unadjusted hazard ratio ( hr ) for death for patients that received radiation was 0.495 ( 95 % ci 0.286 - 0.858 ) .
to understand how age at diagnosis , sex , surgery , and radiation affect survival , we performed univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazards modeling using ajcc stage as a stratification variable ( table 2 ) .
radiation therapy was the only significant factor for overall survival , with a multivariate hr for death of 0.393 ( 95 % ci 0.206 - 0.750 , p = 0.005 ) .

discussion rectal small cell carcinoma is an aggressive and rare cancer with no standard treatment protocol .
in the literature , and consistent with our own seer analysis , the overall median survival for rectal scc cases has ranged from 7 to 11 months [ 5,7 - 12 ] .
small cell lung carcinoma ( sclc ) has primarily been treated with platinum based chemotherapies in conjunction with thoracic radiotherapy , and in some cases , prophylactic cranial irradiation [ 13 - 17 ] .
however , sclc treatments and outcomes may only go so far in translating to extrapulmonary scc treatment .
platinum based chemotherapeutic approaches similar to those used in lung scc have been the mainstay of treatment for many reported cases of extrapulmonary scc [ 17 - 23 ] .
surgery has been used for localized disease in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy , but strong correlative benefits have not been established [ 2,9,13,23,24 ] .
radiotherapy used to treat extrapulmonary sccs , with or without concurrent chemotherapy , has been reported to result in a clinical response in many cases [ 6,13,24 - 28 ]. of the 12 patients who received radiotherapy for gi scc reported by brenner et al. , 11 out of 12 saw a partial / complete response or residual disease , with a survival of 3 - 17 months [ 6 ] .
a larger 127 patient study of limited stage esophageal scc demonstrated a 33 month median survival for patients who received chemoradiotherapy , while those who received surgery and chemotherapy had a 17.5 month median survival [ 26 ] .
we looked to the literature for rectal scc case reports , and found a broad range of treatment strategies and patient outcomes ( table 3 ) .
although some rectal scc cases were treated with chemotherapy regimens similar to that of lung scc , only a small portion of reported cases fell into that category .
the most commonly employed treatment appeared to be surgery alone , followed by surgery and chemotherapy and lastly chemoradiotherapy .
there were only three reported cases in which trimodality therapy was used .
in some cases , radiotherapy was used for palliative measures in the setting of metastatic disease .
the overall survival times in these case studies varied widely , and this may be partly due to differences in tumor stage at diagnosis .
although this literature search gives us a snapshot of the variety of treatment strategies on a case - by - case basis , it lacks the statistical power to guide treatment for future cases .

we cannot rule out the benefit of surgery from this study due to small sample sizes and insufficient power .
it is also important to consider the limitations of using this retrospective seer analysis to draw strong correlative conclusions .
there is no chemotherapy data available in our seer cohort , so we cannot account for any effects arising from differences in chemotherapy regimens .
we were not able to determine from the seer database whether radiation given to the rt group was with curative or palliative intent .
within our no _ rt arm , a significantly greater proportion of the patients had a history of other prior malignancy before receiving a diagnosis of rectal scc ; these patients may have received previous radiation treatment to the pelvic area or previous chemotherapy .
despite the inherent limitations with using the seer database , this study provides evidence for the benefit of radiation therapy for the treatment of rectal scc .
conclusions given the scarcity of literature , we performed an analysis of rectal scc patients entered into the seer database from 1988 to 2010 in the united states .
we were interested in the effect of radiation therapy and surgery on overall survival in rectal scc .
radiation has been shown to confer a benefit in other extrapulmonary sccs and in lung scc [ 6,9,13 - 16,26 ]. and , the role of surgery in extrapulmonary scc is controversial [ 2,9,13,23,24 ] .
our analysis revealed a significant survival benefit to patients that received radiotherapy , with or without surgery .
radiation therapy was the strongest prognostic variable amongst sex , age at diagnosis or surgery for overall survival .
although this seer analysis has limitations , such as lack of chemotherapy information and retrospective study design , it provides guidance on how to manage this rare and aggressive cancer .
these findings may also influence future prospective studies to establish a standard treatment regimen for rectal scc .

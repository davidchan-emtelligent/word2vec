hypophysitis is the acute or chronic inflammation of the pituitary gland .
the spectrum of hypophysitis has expanded in recent years with the addition of two histologic subtypes and recognition as a complication of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors .
despite the increased number of published cases , the pathogenesis of hypophysitis is poorly understood , and treatment strategies are diverse and controversial .
the diagnosis of hypophysitis generally requires histopathologic confirmation .
the presentation and clinical course of hypophysitis varies .
hypophysitis can resolve spontaneously , relapse may occur , and some cases can be refractory to treatment .
keywords hypophysitis hypopituitarism diabetes insipidus issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background hypophysitis has gained greater clinical recognition over time .
several histologic variants and causative agents have been identified .
although hypophysitis remains a rare diagnosis , the number of published cases has increased substantially and expanded to involve a more gender and age diverse population .
the quantity and quality of available information is limited , however , and consensus , especially regarding treatment , has been elusive .
prospective studies are necessary to better define optimal diagnostic and management strategies .
hypophysitis can be classified according to etiology , morphology , and / or histopathology .
etiology refers to primary or secondary cases of hypophysitis .
primary hypophysitis refers to isolated inflammation of the pituitary not associated with medications , systemic inflammatory disorders , infections , or other diseases .
secondary hypophysitis includes cases associated with immunotherapy ( interleukin 2 , interferon , and medications targeting cytotoxic t - lymphocyte antigen - 4 [ ctla - 4 ] or programmed cell death 1 [ pd - 1 ]) [ 1 - 6 ] , rupture of sellar cysts ( rathke 's cleft cysts and craniopharyngiomas ) , and rarely , pituitary adenomas [ 7 - 15 ] .
some authors utilize the term secondary hypophysitis more broadly and also include systemic inflammatory processes which may involve the pituitary gland ( such as sarcoidosis , wegener 's granulomatosis , crohn 's disease , takayasu 's arteritis , cogan 's syndrome ) , inflammatory cell proliferative disorders ( langerhans cell histiocytosis [ lch ] and erdheim - chester disease [ ecd ]) , infections ( tuberculosis , syphilis , whipple 's disease , mycoses ) , and tumor - associated inflammatory infiltrate ( germinoma ) .
morphologic categorization is made according to whether inflammation involves the anterior pituitary gland ( adenohypophysitis ) , posterior gland and stalk ( infundibuloneurohypophystis ) , or entire gland ( panhypophysitis ) .
histologic subtypes of hypophysitis include the following : lymphocytic , granulomatous , xanthomatous , and plasmacytic ( table 1 ) .
occasionally , mixed histology is encountered [ 16 ] .
necrotizing hypophysitis has also been proposed as an additional variant , but it has only been reported in 3 cases [ 17 , 18 ] .
lymphocytic hypophysitis is characterized by diffuse lymphocyte infiltration ( primarily t cells ) of the pituitary gland .
lymphoid follicles can be observed and occasional plasma cells , eosinophils , and fibroblasts may also be present [ 19 ] .
granulomatous hypophysitis shows large numbers of multinucleated giant cells and histiocytes with granuloma formation [ 20 , 21 ] .
xanthomatous hypophysitis demonstrates lipid - laden " foamy " histiocytes without the presence of granulomas [ 22 , 23 ] .
plasmacytic hypophysitis , also termed igg4 - related hypophysitis , has extensive gland infiltration by plasma cells with a high degree of igg4 positivity [ 24 - 26 ] .
pituitary gland fibrosis and atrophy may occur in later stages of these hypophysitis variants .
table 1 histologic subtypes of hypophysitis and patient characteristics gender predominance association with pregnancy mean age of presentation lymphocytic female , ~ 3:1 yes 4th decade granulomatous female , ~ 3:1 no 5th decade xanthomatous female , ~ 3:1 no 4th decade plasmacytic ( igg4 - related ) male , ~ 2:1 no 7th decade mixed histology is observed occasionally , and necrotizing hypophysitis has been proposed as an additional category .
data abstracted from references [ 20 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 66 ] precise usage of the term hypophysitis is important .
loose or inconsistent application ( such as grouping germinoma - associated inflammation and primary lymphocytic hypophysitis ) can cause reader confusion and suggest inappropriate treatments rather than provide diagnostic clarification .
unfortunately , such cases have been mixed with primary hypophysitis in some review paper data sets [ 27 ] .
unless otherwise stated , further discussion in this manuscript will focus on patients with primary hypophysitis .
a caveat exists for igg4 - related hypophysitis , which is often a manifestation of systemic disease with involvement of multiple organs .
most authors have not grouped igg4 - related hypophysitis in the general category of secondary hypophysitis , though it may be reasonable to do so. this manuscript does include an examination of igg4 - related hypophysitis .
given the expanding applications of immune checkpoint inhibitors and increasing frequency of this form of secondary hypophysitis , brief discussion will also be devoted to immunotherapy - associated hypophysitis .
epidemiology the annual incidence of hypophysitis is estimated to be 1 in 7 - 9 million .
hypophysitis accounts for approximately 0.4 % of pituitary surgery cases ( based on a group of large surgical series totaling nearly 10,000 procedures at 5 centers ) [ 28 - 32 ] .
lymphocytic hypophysitis was first reported in 1962 [ 33 ] , and granulomatous hypophysitis was described in the early twentieth century [ 34 , 35 ] .
the first cases of xanthomatous hypophysitis and igg4 - related hypophysitis were published more recently in 1998 and 2004 , respectively [ 22 , 36 ] .
lymphocytic hypophysitis is the most common histologic variant , with over 390 cases reported .
granulomatous hypophysitis is the next most frequent subtype , followed by xanthomatous and igg4 - related hypophysitis [ 25 ] .
lymphocytic hypophysitis was initially thought to occur only in adult women , but cases were subsequently described in men [ 37 ] and children [ 38 - 40 ] .
lymphocytic hypophysitis does occur more frequently in women compared to men ( approximately 3:1 ratio of cases [ 27 ]) , in large part because of its association with pregnancy [ 41 ] .
though recent series have not shown as strong a relationship [ 42 , 43 ] , the majority of cases among reproductive - aged women appear to occur during the end of pregnancy or the first few months after delivery [ 16 , 27 ] .
the incidence of lymphocytic hypophysitis peaks during the fourth decade of life and is uncommon in children and the elderly .
granulomatous and xanthomatous hypophysitis also occur more frequently in women ( approximately 3:1 ratio of cases ) , but neither form is linked with pregnancy .
xanthomatous hypophysitis and lymphocytic hypophysitis have a similar mean age of presentation , but granulomatous hypophysitis is diagnosed more often at a slightly later timepoint in the fifth decade [ 20 , 23 ] .
igg4 - related hypophysitis occurs more frequently in men and tends to develop at a more advanced age in the seventh decade of life .
igg4 - related hypophysitis also does not have an association with pregnancy [ 25 , 26 ] .
immunotherapy - associated hypophysitis occurs in up to 10 - 15 % of patients receiving agents targeting ctla - 4 , on average 2 - 3 months after starting therapy .
older age and male gender may be risk factors for the development of hypophysitis with anti - ctla - 4 medications .
hypophysitis is comparatively rare following treatment with anti - pd - 1 agents .
hypophysitis has also been reported very rarely after treatment with interleukin 2 and interferon [ 6 ] .
clinical presentation patients with hypophysitis present with symptoms related to mass effect from pituitary gland enlargement and pituitary / hypothalamic dysfunction .
headache is the most common presenting symptom , occurring in about half of patients .
visual symptoms due to compression of the optic nerves and / or cranial nerves iii , iv , and vi in the cavernous sinuses can occur in a substantial minority of patients [ 16 , 27 , 42 ] .
cavernous carotid artery occlusion is a rare complication of hypophysitis [ 31 , 44 - 46 ] .
the onset of symptoms , including headache , can be insidious , subacute , or acute even mimicking apoplexy [ 42 , 47 , 48 ] .
the majority of patients with hypophysitis have multiple anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies , and anterior panhypopituitarism is not uncommon .
the severity of hormone deficiencies may appear to be out of proportion to radiographic findings .
serum prolactin levels may be low , normal , or elevated [ 16 , 19 , 27 , 42 ] .
unlike what is observed in clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas [ 49 ] , there is not a clear hierarchy of anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies in hypophysitis patients .
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis dysfunction is frequently present .
diabetes insipidus is also common and may occur in up to half of patients [ 16 , 19 , 27 , 42 ] .
immunotherapy - associated hypophysitis often presents with headache and anterior hypopituitarism .
the degree of pituitary enlargement is typically mild , and compression of the optic apparatus is very rare .
unlike other forms of hypophysitis , diabetes insipidus is extremely unusual in patients with immunotherapy - associated hypophysitis [ 6 ] .
diagnosis the differential diagnosis for primary hypophysitis is broad , and ultimately histopathology ( which is not always possible to obtain ) is required for confirmation .
alternative diagnostic considerations include anatomic variants ( a small / narrow sella turcica with specious pituitary enlargement ) and congenital malformations , pituitary hyperplasia , solid and cystic sellar / suprasellar lesions ( such as pituitary adenomas with or without apoplexy , rathke 's cleft cyst , craniopharyngioma , pituitcyte - derived tumors , hamartoma , dermoid or epidermoid cyst , gangliocytoma , lipoma ) , malignancies ( central nervous system germinoma , lymphoma , glioma , metastatic lesions , lch , ecd ) , systemic inflammatory disorders ( sarcoidosis , wegener 's granulomatosis , crohn 's disease , takayasu 's arteritis , cogan 's syndrome ) , and infections ( tuberculosis , syphilis , whipple 's disease , mycoses ) .
a thorough evaluation is necessary to accurately diagnose hypophysitis , especially in the absence of tissue confirmation .
in the largest series of pituitary stalk lesions published to date , only 4 % of pathology - proven diagnoses represented primary hypophysitis ( and only one - third of cases were inflammatory disorders of any type ) .
significantly , more than half of the confirmed stalk lesions represented neoplastic processes , and half of these cases were metastatic lesions [ 50 ] .
a positive response to glucocorticoids , often interpreted as supporting evidence for hypophysitis , is not specific for inflammatory processes .
glucocorticoids are part of standard treatment regimens for lch and ecd [ 51 , 52 ] , and temporary treatment responses can be observed in lymphoma and intracranial germinomas [ 53 - 55 ] .
treatment responses in the latter are likely due to effects on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes .
this lymphoid infiltrate can be significant enough that misdiagnosis can even occur after tissue biopsy due to sampling error [ 56 - 58 ] .
certain radiology findings may support a diagnosis of hypophysitis .
these imaging characteristics include homogenous enhancement of the pituitary , diffuse symmetric gland enlargement , midline stalk thickening , absence of a posterior pituitary bright spot , normal sellar size , dural thickening , parasellar t2 - weighted hypointensity , and parasellar mucosal thickening .
one group described a radiologic scoring model with an apparent high ability to distinguish hypophysitis from pituitary adenomas [ 59 ] .
this model was not assessed for its discriminatory value against other potential diagnoses .
ultimately , radiologic findings are not specific for hypophysitis , especially compared to nonadenomatous sellar lesions .
diagnostic criteria have been proposed for igg4 - related hypophysitis .
these include the following : 1 ) pituitary histopathology demonstrating mononuclear infiltration with greater than 10 igg4 - positive cells per high - powered field , 2 ) magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showing a sellar mass and / or stalk thickening plus biopsy - proven igg4 - related disease at another tissue site , or 3 ) sellar mass and / or stalk thickening plus a serum igg4 level > 140 mg / dl and a radiologic and clinical response to treatment with glucocorticoids [ 24 ] .
these proposed criteria may be inadequate in some circumstances .
recent studies have shown that neither serum igg4 levels [ 60 , 61 ] nor igg4 - positive tissue staining [ 62 - 65 ] are necessarily sensitive nor specific for igg4 - related disease .
according to more recent international consensus criteria , diagnoses of igg4 - related disease are primarily based upon pathology demonstrating 2 of 3 major histopathological features ( dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate , storiform fibrosis [ a cartwheel or whirled pattern of fibrosis , at least focally ] , and obliterative phlebitis ) with appropriate clinicopathologic correlation .
igg4 serum levels and tissue staining have important secondary roles [ 66 ] .
published cases of igg4 - related hypophysitis typically do not comment on the presence or absence of such histologic features [ 26 ] .
when it is described , storiform fibrosis has been reported in some [ 67 ] but not all cases of igg4 - related hypophysitis [ 68 ] following tissue analysis .
obliterative phlebitis has not been reported in any case of igg4 - related hypophysitis .
as ngaosuwan et al. noted , the diagnosis of igg4 - related hypophysitis is difficult without the presence of other organ involvement [ 69 ] .
although only a minority of reported igg4 - related hypophysitis cases have included histopathology , almost all patients had other organ involvement [ 70 ] .
no case of immunotherapy - associated hypophysitis has been confirmed by pituitary gland biopsy .
diagnoses are established clinically based upon the close temporal relationship of immunotherapy treatment and the development of hypopituitarism with reversible pituitary enlargement [ 6 , 71 ] .
the relationship of lymphocytic hypophysitis with pregnancy [ 27 , 41 ] may also allow a clinical diagnosis to be made with a reasonable degree of confidence in some pregnant or early postpartum women without tissue confirmation when appropriate imaging and biochemical findings are present with an otherwise negative thorough diagnostic evaluation .
patient demographics and coexistent medical conditions may also help focus diagnostic considerations .
for example , intracranial germinomas have a peak incidence in the second decade of life and are extremely rare after the age of 30 [ 72 ] .
lch can be diagnosed at any age , but the incidence of this disease progressively declines throughout life [ 73 , 74 ] .
given the broad differential diagnosis for hypophysitis , caution and close follow up is strongly advised for the treatment of presumed cases lacking histopathologic confirmation .
treatment no prospective controlled studies have examined the treatment of hypophysitis , and a limited number of cases detail the natural history of untreated disease .
available retrospective data sets are confounded by reporting and treatment selection biases and likely encompass a heterogeneous group of diseases due to the lack of histologic confirmation in many cases and variable clinical evaluation .
medical therapies differ significantly by the type of agent , dosage , and duration of treatment .
symptoms from mass effect , such as optic nerve compression and other cranial nerve palsies , and severe headache are general indications for the treatment of hypophysitis ( fig. 1 ) .
practice patterns vary for less clinically severe cases .
it is unclear whether treatment with immune suppressing medications improves pituitary function outcomes compared to supportive therapy. fig. 1 hypophysitis was diagnosed in a 30 year old during the late third trimester of pregnancy .
the patient presented with 3 weeks of progression vision loss .
panel a depicts a coronal pre - contrast t1 - weighted image of the pituitary .
transsphenoidal biopsy ( panel b ) demonstrated lymphocytic hypophysitis and glucocorticoid therapy was begun with prednisone 60 mg daily .
following delivery , the pituitary gland decreased in size ( panel c ) and remained stable 2 months ( panel d ) and 5 months ( panel e ) after glucocorticoid taper and discontinuation spontaneous resolution of pituitary enlargement has been observed in a number of published cases of hypophysitis [ 19 ] .
one group recently reported regression of radiologic findings in 15 / 15 patients receiving supportive therapy [ 43 ] .
a large recent retrospective review of hypophysitis cases in germany noted radiologic improvement or stability in 16 / 22 cases without active treatment [ 75 ] .
pituitary surgery ( gross total resection or partial resection ) and glucocorticoid therapy appeared to be somewhat more effective at mass reduction in that study .
surgery ( generally patients undergoing gross total resection ) was associated with less improvement and greater loss of pituitary function .
patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy had a significant risk of relapsing pituitary enlargement and experienced frequent side effects from treatment .
approximately one - quarter of patients receiving supportive therapy demonstrated improvement in pituitary function , and 82 % of that group had stable or improved function .
similar results were reported in the patients treated with pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids .
headache resolution was similar in all three groups [ 75 ] .
comparable rates of pituitary function recovery were reported following supportive therapy by khare et al .
[ 43 ] .
a review by lupi et al. suggested that pituitary function improvement may occur in approximately one - half of patients treated with glucocorticoids .
importantly , histopathology was available in only 22 % of these patients [ 76 ] .
similarly , a minority of patients had tissue confirmation in the study from germany .
moreover , evaluation for secondary causes of hypophysitis was limited in the majority of those patients [ 42 , 75 ] .
limited clinical evaluations were also frequent in the largest review of granulomatous hypophysitis cases [ 20 ] .
other immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate , azathioprine , rituximab , infliximab , cyclosporine , and mycophenolate mofetil have been utilized in a small number of patients with hypophysitis [ 75 - 82 ] .
treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy has been reported in a few patients , typically with refractory disease .
radiation dosages ranged from low levels to higher amounts used to treat pituitary adenomas [ 31 , 83 , 84 ] .
patients with immunotherapy - associated hypophysitis have been treated with physiologic to high - dose glucocorticoids .
although it is unclear whether pharmacologic dosages of glucocorticoids improve patient outcomes , higher doses do not appear to negatively impact the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapy or patient survival [ 6 ] .
improvement of pituitary function occurs in some patients following the resolution of hypophysitis ; thyroidal and gonadal axis normalization occurs more frequently than adrenal recovery .
the development of hypophysitis may be associated with improved patient survival in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab [ 71 , 85 ] .
pathogenesis the mechanisms underlying the development of hypophysitis are unknown .
other autoimmune diseases coexist in a portion of patients with hypophysitis .
unlike many of these other conditions , pituitary autoantigens in hypophysitis have not yet been clearly identified .
several candidates have been proposed , including growth hormone , pituitary gland specific factors 1a and 2 [ 86 , 87 ] , alpha - enolase and gamma - enolase [ 88 , 89 ] , secretogrannin ii [ 90 ] , chorionic somatomammotropin , cgi - 99 [ 91 ] , and corticotroph - specific transcription factor [ 92 ] .
measurements of antibodies to these proteins , however , do not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be diagnostically useful [ 16 , 93 ] .
given the lack of clinically validated autoantigens , many studies have utilized indirect immunofluorescence ( iif ) to detect the presence of pituitary autoantibodies .
ricciuti et al. systematically described methodologic limitations of iif in the assessment of anti - pituitary antibodies , their potential effects on data interpretation , and methods to optimize results [ 94 ] .
the pathogenic role of igg4 in igg4 - related disease , including hypophysitis , is unclear , and it has been suggested that elevation of these antibodies may represent a bystander phenomenon [ 95 ] .
igg4 predominance often correlates with immune downregulation , in part due to its ability to participate in fragment antigen binding arm exchange [ 96 ] .
immunotherapy agents presumably can activate an autoimmune process directed against unidentified pituitary antigens .
pituitary autoantibodies were detected in patients who developed hypophysitis following treatment with ipilimumab ( a monoclonal antibody targeting ctla - 4 ) , but these antibodies were not present in patients without hypophysitis .
ctla - 4 is also expressed by the pituitary gland , and treatment with ipilimumab may directly target pituitary cells via activation of the classical complement pathway and antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity ( adcc ) [ 97 - 99 ] .
pituitary ctla - 4 expression levels appear to vary widely [ 100 ] and may affect the risk of developing hypophysitis following treatment with ipilimumab .
in support of this hypothesis , hypophysitis has not been reported in patients with germline ctla - 4 mutations , although many of these patients had other severe autoimmune diseases which can occur following treatment with ipilimumab [ 101 , 102 ] .
it is unknown whether pd - 1 is expressed by the pituitary gland .
notably , anti - pd - 1 agents are igg4 - based antibodies , which can not activate the classical complement pathway and are not effective mediators for adcc [ 96 , 103 - 105 ] .
conclusions currently , the diagnosis of primary hypophysitis typically requires a thorough evaluation for other potential neoplastic lesions , infiltrative diseases , infection , and systemic inflammatory processes plus histopathologic confirmation .
in some cases , tissue biopsy may not be feasible .
cases of immunotherapy - associated hypophysitis and lymphocytic hypophysitis associated with pregnancy may potentially be diagnosed with some degree of confidence without surgery .
cranial nerve deficits due to mass effect from pituitary gland enlargement and severe headache are general indications for treatment with medical therapy and / or surgery .
it is unclear whether active treatment improves clinical outcomes compared to supportive therapy for more mild cases of hypophysitis , and the therapies may be associated with side effects .
pituitary gland debulking rather than gross total resection is more commonly performed .
glucocorticoids ( at variable dosages and duration ) are the most frequent choice for medical therapy , though many other immunosuppressive agents have been utilized in the treatment of hypophysitis .
even when treatment is initially successful , disease recurrence is not uncommon .
radiation therapy appears promising , especially for refractory cases of hypophysitis , but the available published data consists of only a handful of patients .
hypophysitis is an increasingly recognized but rare and poorly understood heterogeneous disease .
the pathogenesis of primary hypophysitis is not yet known , and clinically validated disease markers have not been identified .
in the absence of more detailed knowledge , various etiologic , morphologic , and histologic categories have been proposed , but the clinical utility of such schemas is limited .
inconsistent usage of terminology and variable diagnostic evaluations have also clouded data interpretation .
available studies are largely limited to retrospective series that likely include patients with diverse pathologies .
clinical investigation is constrained by the rarity of the disease .
the acquisition of sufficient controlled prospective data will require multicenter collaboration .
until such investigations take place , optimal management strategies will remain largely undefined and controversial .

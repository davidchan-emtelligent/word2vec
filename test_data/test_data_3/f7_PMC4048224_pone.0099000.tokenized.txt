background hiv patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy have undetectable viremia making it impossible to screen plasma hiv tropism if regimen change is required during suppression .
we investigated the prevalence and predictors of tropism switch from ccr5 - using (" r5 ") to non - ccr5 - using (" non - r5 ") before and after viral suppression in the initially therapy - naive homer cohort from british columbia , canada .
methods we compared pre - therapy and post - suppression viral genotypic tropism in patients who initiated on pi / nnrti - based antiretroviral regimens between 1996 - 1999 ( n = 462 ) .
virologic suppression was defined as having two consecutive viral loads of < 500 copies / ml , which was the sensitivity limit of most viral load assays at the time .
viral tropism was inferred by v3 - loop - population - sequencing and geno2pheno [ coreceptor ] with cutoff at 5.75 % false positive rate ( fpr ) .
results when virologic suppression was defined as two - consecutive viral loads < 500 copies / ml , 34 ( 9 %) of the 397 patients with pre - therapy r5 - virus switched to non - r5 at viral load rebound after a median of 19 months ( iqr 8 - 41 months ) of undetectable viremia .
duration of viral load suppression was not a predictor of switch , but lower cd4 count during suppression ( median 400 versus 250 cells / ml ) and an increased prevalence of pre - therapy non - r5 hiv by " deep " sequencing ( median 0.2 % versus 3.2 %) were independently associated with switch ( p = 0.03 and p < 0.0001 , respectively ) .
conclusion r5 - to - non - r5 tropism switches in plasma virus after undetectable viremia were relatively rare events especially among patients with higher cd4 counts during virologic suppression .
our study supports the use of pre - suppression tropism results if maraviroc is being considered during virologic suppression in this subgroup of patients .

introduction hiv requires host cell coreceptors such as ccr5 and / or cxcr4 in addition to cd4 for cell - entry [ 1 ] .
viruses that use ccr5 - molecules for cellular entry are referred to as " r5. " viruses that use receptors other than ccr5 , including the cxcr4 - using " x4 " viruses and the " dual / mixed - tropic " populations can collectively be termed " non - r5. " as ccr5 - antagonists are only effective against r5 virus , viral tropism must be determined before prescribing this drug class .
at the time of publication , maraviroc remains the first and only ccr5 - anatognist approved for clinical use .
there are two approaches to determine plasma viral tropism commonly used in north america , phenotypic and genotypic .
the phenotypic method offered by monogram biosciences in the united states , the enhanced sensitivity trofile assay ( esta ) [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] utilizes env gene cloning and an infection - based assay [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
genotypic methods are based on the amplification and population - sequencing of the v3 - loop from patient viruses ; " deep " sequencing technologies such as 454 ( roche ) offers sensitivity comparable to phenotypic assays and outperforms population - sequencing in the detection of viral quasispecies for hiv tropism prediction and have recently gained popularity [ 6 ] .
the v3 - loop sequences are interpreted using prediction algorithms such as geno2pheno [ coreceptor ] ( g2p ) [ 7 ] .
however , both phenotypic and genotypic tropism prediction methods are limited to testing samples with sufficient plasma viral load typically above 250 hiv rna copies / ml. the majority of patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) successfully suppress plasma viral load to undetectable levels (< 50 copies / ml ) , making it impossible to perform viral tropism testing during viral suppression due to the detection limits of these plasma - based assays .
this poses a challenge when considering ccr5 - antagonist - based regimens as suitable options for treatment simplification or tolerability issues [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
to tackle this problem and to study the effect of haart on viral tropism , investigators have focused on two main approaches : first , to examine tropism of integrated hiv proviral dna in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) during virological suppression , and second , to examine post - suppression plasma rna tropism .
studies on the effect of haart on the evolution of viral tropism have focused primarily on comparing tropism of pre - therapy plasma viral rna with tropism of viral dna collected during suppression and observed concordance between 52 - 93 % [ 10 ] - [ 16 ] .
studies on viremic patients have shown 71 - 100 % tropism concordance between paired dna and rna samples [ 12 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 17 ] - [ 23 ] .
based on this limited evidence , dna tropism testing of aviremic patients switching to maraviroc is currently recommended in several treatment guidelines [ 24 ] - [ 26 ] and is available both as a phenotypic and genotypic tests [ 22 ] , [ 27 ] .
however , the clinical utility of dna tropism testing to predict maraviroc treatment outcomes in patients with low level viremia and / or undetectable viremia remains to be proven in randomized trials .
results from the smaller - scaled maraviroc " switch " studies demonstrated safety and efficacy [ 28 ] - [ 30 ] , and it is hopeful that larger - scaled multicenter clinical trials such as the recruiting march study [ 31 ] will shed more light on this knowledge gap .
a second approach , the examination of pre - suppression hiv tropism from rna , is considered in a few treatment guidelines [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] based on small - scale studies that have shown limited evolution of plasma rna tropism during haart [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
the objective of this study was to compare plasma viral tropism between pre - therapy baseline and post - suppression time points in the absence of ccr5 - anatagonist selective pressure .
our results provide relevant evidence to plasma - based tropism testing of pre - suppression samples for patients with undetectable viremia who wish to consider a ccr5 antagonist .

cohort and patient inclusion criteria homer is a well - characterized cohort consisting of 1188 treatment - naive hiv - infected adults in british columbia who initiated highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) between 1996 and 1999 [ 34 ] - [ 36 ] .
as shown in figure 1 , a retrospective search of this database showed a subgroup of 462 individuals satisfied all four inclusion criteria of our primary analysis : individuals who ( 1 ) had at least one population - based sequencing tropism test result within six - months before their first exposure to haart (" baseline tropism ") ; ( 2 ) had at least two consecutive samples collected with viral loads below 500 copies / ml post - haart initiation (" viral suppression ") ; ( 3 ) after viral suppression had at least two consecutive samples collected with viral loads above 500 copies / ml (" viral rebound ") ; and ( 4 ) had genotypic tropism test results available from within six months after the date of viral rebound (" tropism at viral rebound ") .
viral suppression was redefined as < 50 copies / ml in part of our secondary analysis ( n = 276 ) .

laboratory methods baseline v3 sequences were determined as previously described [ 34 ] .
for follow - up samples , hiv rna was extracted from 0.5 ml plasma samples using the nuclisens easymag ( biomerieux ) .
for population sequencing , a single - round ( non - triplicate ) reverse transcription and " nested " pcr were performed and sequencing reaction was performed with abi 3730 dna sequencer and bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit ( applied biosystems ) as previously described [ 28 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
resulting chromatograms were base - called with in - house software recall and aligned to a modified hxb2 v3 - loop reference [ 39 ] .
all sanger sequences were deposited into genbank ( accession numbers ef637088 - ef638007 ) .
for " deep " sequencing , samples were put through triplicate reverse transcription reactions and " nested " pcr incorporating multiplex tags ( mids a to l ) as previously described [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
" deep " sequencing reactions were performed with genome sequencer flx system standard kit with an average read length of 250 bases according to the manufacturer 's supplied protocol ( roche / 454 life sciences ) .
a median of 1998 sequences ( iqr 1575 - 2571 ) were obtained per sample .
all population and 454 sequence data are available from the authors upon request , subject to review by the providence health care research ethics board .
data analysis v3 sequences were interpreted by g2p [ coreceptor ] [ 7 ] and tropism was inferred using cutoffs optimized to predict virologic response in the phase iii clinical trials of maraviroc [ 28 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 40 ] - [ 42 ] .
in our primary analysis , a sample was classified as " r5 " by population sequencing if the false positive rate ( fpr ) predicted by g2p [ coreceptor ] was > 5.75 % , and " non - r5 " if fpr was <= 5.75 % ; a sequence was defined " r5 " by " deep " sequencing if fpr was > 3.5 % and " non - r5 " if <= 3.5 % and a sample was considered non - r5 overall if >= 2 % of sequences were found to be non - r5 .
in our secondary analysis , population - sequencing fpr cutoffs of 5 % , 10 % , 15 % and 20 % were explored .
statistical association analyses of demographic and clinical parameters were performed using sas and / or graphpad prism 5 .
pre and post - suppression nucleotide identity comparison in which base - mixtures were counted as concordant observations were performed with python 3.3 scripting language .
results prevalence and predictors of plasma hiv r5 - to - non - r5 tropism switches we first compared pre - therapy tropisms to post - suppression tropism at viral rebound .
in our primary analysis , we defined virologic suppression as < 500 copies / ml in order to suit the most common viral load assays' detection limit during the homer cohort enrollment period from 1996 to 1999 .
a total of 462 patients met the study criteria. of the 397 subjects with pre - therapy r5 viruses , 34 were non - r5 after viral rebound ( 8.6 %) ; of the 65 subjects with baseline non - r5 viruses , 16 were r5 after viral rebound ( 24.6 %) ( figure 1 ) .
subjects in this study experienced periods of suppressive haart lasting a median of 19 ( iqr 8 - 41 ) months .

g fisher 's exact test comparing pi and nnrti - containing therapy against remained r5 and r5 - to - non - r5 switch .
we then assessed associations with the clinical parameters listed in table 1 .
none of the baseline characteristics was predictive of switch .
among post - therapy characteristics tested , only cd4 count at suppression ( defined as the cd4 count test result obtained closest to the date of viral suppression ) was found to be a predictor of switch .
subjects with r5 - virus at baseline whose virus remained r5 after rebound ( n = 363 ) had significantly higher cd4 counts at viral load suppression ( median 400 cells / ml , iqr 240 - 570 ) than those who experienced a r5 - to - non - r5 switch ( median 250 cells / ml , iqr 160 - 530 ; p = 0.031 , mann - whitney test ) .
importantly , duration of viral load suppression did not return as a predictor of switch .
non - r5 - to - r5 switches and their associations with clinical parameters were not examined in this study because of unclear clinical importance .
pre - therapy baseline " deep " sequencing results were available for a subset of patients ( n = 156 ) with baseline r5 virus by population sequencing ( figure 1 ) .
in these patients a median of 0.2 % ( iqr 0.1 - 0.7 %) of detected sequences were inferred to be non - r5 .
using this method , 11 / 18 ( 61 %) of individuals who switched tropism from r5 at baseline to non - r5 after viral rebound by population sequencing were called " non - r5 " at baseline by " deep " sequencing (>= 2 % " non - r5 " sequences ) , compared to 12 / 138 ( 9 %) of individuals who did not switch tropism ( p < 0.0001 , chi - square test ) .
also , an increased prevalence of non - r5 viruses in pre - therapy samples was significantly associated with r5 - to - non - r5 tropism switches ( p < 0.0001 , mann - whitney test , figure 2 ) .
this suggests that dichotomized results from the " deep " sequencing tropism prediction assay of pre - therapy samples also predicted tropism switches after viral rebound .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0099000.g002 figure 2 454 " deep " sequencing results of pre - therapy " r5 " samples by population sequencing .
in patients with pre - therapy baseline r5 - viruses ( n = 156 ) , " deep " sequencing reveals that the prevalence of non - r5 viruses before starting haart was a significant predictor of r5 - to - non - r5 change ( p < 0.0001 , mann - whitney test ) .
median non - r5 prevalence by " deep " sequencing among subjects who were tested as having r5 virus that remained r5 by population sequencing was 0.2 % in comparison to 3.2 % among those who had switched from r5 to non - r5 .
horizontal bars indicate median values .
for graphing and visualization purposes , values less than or equal to 1 were given randomized numbers between 0.01 and 0.8 such that samples with < 1 % non - r5 prevalence would randomly disperse across the plot from - 2 to - 0.1 log copies / ml. the dotted line at 2 % non - r5 represents our group 's optimized cutoff value (> 2 % non - r5 sequences ) used for dichotomizing samples into non - r5 or r5 .
the dashed line at 20 % represents the approximate sensitivity limit of population sequencing ; five samples in this figure had % non - r5 above this sensitivity limit indicating 454 and population sequencing discordance .
detailed examination of these five samples suggested the high % non - r5 observed was a summation effect from multiple less prevalent non - r5 sequences in four , and was due to random sampling bias in one sample ( table s1 ) .
r5 - to - non - r5 tropism switches during period of detectable viremia in the analysis described above , pre - haart viral tropism was compared to post - suppression viral tropism .
however , periods of detectable viremia following the start of haart but before viral suppression ( r5 - to - non - r5 n = 34 median 5 months iqr 3 - 27 , table 1 ) and periods of detectable viremia post - suppression before the first available tropism results ( r5 - to - non - r5 n = 34 , median 4 months iqr 3 - 6 ) might have provided sufficient time for viral evolution and a chance for non - r5 hiv populations to be selected , which would lead to an over - estimation of our observed switch prevalence over the period of suppressive - haart .
to address this study limitation , we looked for and genotyped any archived plasma samples or tropism test results collected immediately before and / or after viral suppression for the 34 subjects who experienced r5 - to - non - r5 switches .
appropriate pre - suppression samples or tropism test results were available for 21 / 34 ( 62 %) of the subjects. of these , non - r5 - viruses were detected in 11 before viral load suppression occurred ; " deep " sequencing results available for 8 of the 11 subjects revealed median prevalence of 3 % non - r5 ( iqr 1 - 9 %) at pre - therapy baseline .
appropriate untested post - suppression plasma sampled before our definition of " first tropism test result available after viral rebound " were available for 3 / 34 ( 9 %) of the subjects. of these , one subject harbored post - suppression r5 - virus ; " deep " sequencing showed 1 % non - r5 at pre - therapy baseline .
in summary , 12 / 34 ( 35 %) of the initially observed r5 - to - non - r5 tropism switches could be explained by switches that occurred during periods of detectable viremia .
secondary analysis : exploration of other cutoff values and nucleotide sequence comparison as a sensitivity analysis reflecting a more modern definition of virologic suppression , the analysis was repeated with suppression defined as < 50 copies / ml ( fpr cutoff 5.75 % , n = 276 ) .
results were similar to our primary analysis : r5 - to - non - r5 switch occurred in 13 / 247 ( 5 %) and non - r5 - to - r5 switch occurred in 6 / 29 ( 21 %) patients .
sensitivity analysis of different g2p [ coreceptor ] fpr cutoffs 5 % , 10 % , 15 % and 20 % in combination with viral suppression defined as 500 or 50 copies / ml showed an underestimation of r5 - to - non - r5 switches at lower fpr cutoffs : when suppression was defined as < 500 copies / ml , r5 - to - non - r5 switches occurred at 7 % , 10 % , 14 % , 17 % prevalence , and non - r5 switches occurred at 27 % , 24 % , 25 % , 22 % respectively .
when suppression was defined as < 50 copies / ml , r5 - to - non - r5 switches occurred at 5 % , 8 % , 12 % , 15 % , and non - r5 switches occurred at 24 % , 24 % , 29 % , 22 % respectively .
next , we compared pre - therapy and post - suppression v3 - loop population - sequences .
phylogenetic comparison by neighbor - joining tree shows that most sequence - pairs clustered together but this method was limited by the short sequence length ( figure s1 ) ; per - position nucleotide identity comparison shows a low number of base discordance between sequences obtained from the same individuals from the two time points ( median nucleotide discordance count was 0 , iqr 0 - 2 , min 0 max 19 ; average v3 loop length 105 nucleotides ) .
discussion in this study we compared the pre - haart hiv rna viral tropism with the viral tropism after viral rebound in the plasma of individuals of the british columbia homer cohort .
in our primary analysis , we reported r5 - to - non - r5 tropism switches in less than 9 % of subjects over a median of 19 months of pvl suppression on haart .
this switch was predicted by a higher percentage prevalence of non - r5 species at pre - therapy baseline and a lower cd4 count during viral suppression , but not by the duration of viral load suppression .
previous smaller - scale studies ( ranging from n = 18 to 36 pre - therapy r5 cases ) reported pre - therapy - r5 to post - therapy - non - r5 tropism change in 5 - 25 % of their subjects [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 43 ] , compared to 20 % ( n = 30 ) in untreated patients [ 10 ] .
our study population was at least ten times larger than any previous studies and our observation fell within the range of previous observations .
as such , this study has provided additional supporting evidence for clinical management guidelines [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] on the use of pre - suppression tropism results to infer eligibility of initiating a maraviroc - containing regimen during suppression .
furthermore , our results suggest that the relative prevalence of non - r5 viruses at baseline detected by " deep " sequencing could partially explain eventual tropism switches observed in population sequencing results .
in 61 % of cases , patients whose hiv tropism switched from r5 to non - r5 would have already been classified as non - r5 at baseline by the more sensitive deep sequencing test .
however , the explanation for the observed association with low cd4 counts during suppression is less clear .
it is interesting to note that several studies have reported 2 - 6 times lower nadir and / or baseline cd4 count as the only association identified with tropism switches [ 10 ] , [ 16 ] , whereas another study observed a two - fold lower nadir cd4 count in patients hosting dna - tropism - based non - r5 viruses compared to those hosting r5 viruses [ 44 ] while other studies were unable to find cd4 count associations of this kind [ 12 ] , [ 45 ] .
selection pressures that lead to a r5 - to - non - r5 tropism switch in the absence of ccr5 - antagonists remain poorly understood .
there were a number of limitations to this study .
the first is our study 's definition of " undetectable viral load " and " viral suppression " of < 500 copies / ml. previous studies showed that prolonged periods of low level viremia ( llv , roughly defined as 50 - 500 copies / ml ) allowed for viral evolution defined as increasing numbers of drug resistance mutations and / or hla - escape mutations [ 45 ] - [ 53 ] .
our current definition could lead to an over - estimation of the prevalence of tropism switch if results were to apply to the current definition of undetectable viremia which is typically 20 - 50 copies / ml [ 54 ] .
indeed , our secondary analysis showed that when suppression was redefined to < 50 copies / ml , we detected a lower prevalence ( from 9 % to 5 %) of r5 - to - non - r5 switches .
a second study limitation was our choice of pre - haart tropism as the comparator .
although the length of time between haart initiation and viral suppression was not significantly associated with tropism switch , some patients in this study achieved viral suppression over one year after therapy initiation , allowing active viral replication and potential viral evolution .
indeed , when we tested additional samples collected immediately before or after viral load suppression from these individuals , we observed 35 % of the patients who experienced r5 - to - non - r5 switches could be explained by switches during the initial decline in viremia prior to suppression or by post - suppression switches .
a third study limitation was genotypic tropism determination methods' limited sensitivity / specificity relative to the " true " viral tropism or to the clinical outcomes of individuals receiving ccr5 - antagonist - based regimens .
it is important to understand that even esta , a phenotypic tropism determination assay , is limited by sensitivity and specificity [ 55 ] , [ 56 ] .
while a 100 % sensitive method to determine viral tropism does not exist because there is no distinct gold standard for hiv viral tropism [ 26 ] , [ 57 ] , population - sequencing - based genotypic tropism prediction has been reported to predict maraviroc - based regimen virological outcome [ 28 ] , [ 37 ] and have a sensitivity of 67.4 % and specificity of 92.6 % against a phenotypic assay [ 37 ] , which implies that our reported prevalence of post - haart tropism change can only be taken as an estimation .
overall , this study showed that r5 - to - non - r5 tropism switches after periods of suppressive - haart were relatively rare events , especially in patients with higher cd4 counts during suppression and / or patients with a lower prevalence of circulating non - r5 quasispecies in their baseline plasma samples .
since a large proportion of our observed cases of tropism switches occurred during periods of detectable viremia , the last tropism test before suppression could be more ideal than a pre - haart tropism test in predicting tropism switch after viral rebound .
furthermore , our " deep " sequencing results reinforce the increased sensitivity of " deep " sequencing assay as a prediction tool for viral tropism .
these results also suggest that pre - haart plasma rna " deep " sequencing tropism results , reported either as the percentage non - r5 prevalence or dichotomized as r5 / non - r5 , could serve as yet another complementary test in addition to dna tropism predictions for patients with undetectable viremia .
future studies should examine if pre - haart or pre - suppression rna r5 tropism is a predictor of clinical outcome in patients who switched into maraviroc - containing regimens during viral suppression .

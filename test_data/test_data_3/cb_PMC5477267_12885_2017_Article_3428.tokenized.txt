background in italy women aged 50 - 69 are invited for a population - based breast cancer ( bc ) screening .
physicians , policy makers and patients associations agree on the need to inform women about the benefits and harms in order to permit an informed decision .
decision aids ( da ) are an effective way to support people in their decisions about health .
this trial aims to assess women 's informed choices , according to their health literacy and values , on participating or not in bc screening for the first time .
benefits , harms and controversies are presented .
methods / design the impact of the da will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with a two - week follow - up. women will be randomized via web to da or a standard brochure .
we will invite 8160 women , to obtain a final sample of 816 women .
the primary outcome will be informed choice , measured on the basis of knowledge , attitudes and intentions on bc screening .
secondary outcomes are participation rate , satisfaction on information and decisional conflict .
discussion the web da will be open - source and implemented on bc screenings and its efficacy for increasing informed choice will be tested .
this model could be applied to other healthcare settings , cancer screenings , and public health programs .
trial registration the protocol for this trial was registered with the clinicaltrials.gov registry on march 16 , 2017 : nct03097653 .
keywords informed choice mammography screening decision aid decision - making the italian association for cancer research ig2015 - 17274 mosconi paola issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background in the 1990s , several european countries implemented screening services as public health programs .
in 2003 , the european council recommendation promoted the implementation of screening programs in europe , for breast , bowel and cervical cancer .
this decision was confirmed , after assessment of the available evidence , in the recently released european code against cancer [ 1 ] .
in italy , as in other european countries , mammography screening is offered by the national health service ( nhs ) , free of charge .
about 80 % of the target women are invited , with wide variability among northern and southern regions [ 2 ] .
the policy is to invite women aged 50 - 69 - in some regions extended to 45 - 69 or 50 - 74 - by a personal letter , with a pre - specified appointment every two years .
fostering informed decision - making on breast cancer screening by providing balanced information on its benefits and harms is considered a responsibility of the public health system [ 3 ] .
although the debate on mammography screening is lively [ 4 - 7 ] , most stakeholders - physicians , policy - makers , lay people or patients' associations - agree on the need to inform women properly , and consider this an ethical obligation [ 8 ] .
the current debate on mammography screening adds a new challenge : how disagreement among scientists , such as uncertainties about the estimates especially of potential harms from the screening , should be managed , and how public health institutions and scientists should cope with communication when there are data interpretation divergences and conflicts .
some studies have shown that women did not properly understood the value of mammography screening , confounding early diagnosis with prevention [ 4 , 9 ] .
other studies have found that many leaflets and websites fail to provide all the right information to women , highlighting more the benefits than the risks , such as overdetection and overtreatment [ 10 - 12 ] .
in 2012 , the nhs - uk ( united kingdom ) set up an independent panel to review the evidence , and concluded for the continuation of screening program , but asked for changes in the communication and information about benefits and harms , especially overdetection of breast cancer [ 13 ] .
the screening promoters therefore have the duty to provide all the information relevant for an informed choice , including that on the uncertainty of the estimates and the scientific controversy , to provide to women the best benefit - risk estimate , based on professional opinions .
in cancer screening , the communication of quantitative information is particularly complex .
however , transparency about benefits and harms is a key principle for good quality information - although this should hold true for any kind of information , in all human interactions [ 14 ] .
qualitative studies have discussed how to balance the evidence - based information to enable women to participate in healthcare decisions [ 15 ] .
different models of information have been suggested , and formally tested in randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) [ 16 , 17 ] .
decision aids ( da ) are an effective way to help women to decide about mammography screening .
they improve people 's knowledge of risks and benefits , reduce decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed and unclear about personal values , and encourage women to take a more active role in decision - making without anxiety [ 13 , 14 ] .
to give women the chance to decide according to their preferences , values , and attitude , information must be organized and delivered through a multilevel , interactive model that takes into consideration the users' needs and willingness .
this model should leave women free to seek the depth and breadth of information necessary to make a weighted decision , in a personalized way that should also respect their " right not to know " .
a personalized informative model can influence not only the participation in breast cancer screening , but also empower personal choice : increasing women 's awareness , maintaining realistic expectations , and increasing women 's satisfaction about the decision process .
this rct is the experimental phase of a project regarding the decision process on breast cancer screening participation .
the project was informed by a review of the literature on da and the organization of focus groups to collect women 's information needs ( phase 1 ) .
a web interactive da was developed , where benefits , harms and controversy on mammography screening are fully presented ( phase 2 ) .
the present study aims to assess the effect of this interactive web da on informed choice - measured on the basis of knowledge , attitudes and intentions concerning breast cancer screening - comparing the da with standard information provided on the web .
secondary aims are the participation rate in breast cancer screening , satisfaction with the information , the time spent on the da , and the decisional conflict process .
methods this is a multicenter rct .
the hypothesis is of superiority for the primary endpoint regarding the efficacy of the da in increasing women 's informed choices .
if the null hypothesis is rejected , the secondary endpoint regarding the screening participation rate will be analysed with a non - inferiority hypothesis .
the project is funded by airc , the italian association for cancer research - ig2015 - 17274 .
study setting the study has been implemented within the national health service screening program in turin [ 18 ] , florence [ 19 ] and palermo [ 20 ] , respectively in the north , center and south of italy .
organized mammographic screening in the florence health district in the tuscany region has been ongoing since the late 1980s .
every two years it invites 50 - 69 year - old women and the 70 - 74 year women who had participated in the previous round .
recently the tuscany region government decided to gradually implement the organized screening for 45 - 49 year - old women , inviting them annually until age 50 .
in turin , organized mammographic screening was introduced in 1992 .
every two years it invites 120,000 50 - 69 year - old residents .
currently women aged 45 - 49 receive an informative letter , giving them the opportunity to spontaneously join the program , and have an annually mammogram .
women aged 70 - 74 years can also agree to continue to participate in the biennially program .
in palermo organized mammographic screening started in 2004 , inviting 86,000 50 - 69 year - old women every two years .
the participation rate among is about 50 % for florence , 75 % for turin and 40 % for palermo .
the programs have a consolidated monitoring and quality assurance system , that collects and analyses data on a yearly basis .
participants' eligibility and randomization newly invited women to the three screening programs ( florence , palermo and turin ) will be invited to participate in the trial .
since of all three screening programs are quite old , the number of newly invited women at every round is limited , accounting for , at most , 25 % of the entire 50 - 69 year - old subjects .
the largest group is mainly the 50 - 52 year - olds .
in this trial , the majority of women enrolled will probably belong to that particular age group and to 45 - 49 group for the two centers that implemented screening from 45 to 74 .
women of this age in each screening center , will receive an invitation letter to the trial with a personal code number for registering on the platform .
all code numbers will be extracted and transferred from the screening centers to the platform .
the random allocation will be on a 1:1 basis , provided by a computer - generated allocation sequence .
no stratification will be done .
the nature of the intervention and allocation ratio precludes masking of the participants and trial staff .
intervention and control arms the women will be randomized to ( fig 1 ) : intervention group : web platform with multilevel information and an aid for the decision to be taken. fig. 1 study flow diagram control group : web platform with a standard brochure .
intervention the content in the web platform is structured in 16 - 20 screens ; each screen contains the answer to a question ( i.e. what is breast cancer ?
what is mammography screening ?
what are its benefits and harms ?
what results can be expected from mammography screening ?) .
the language is plain and the contents are defined on the basis of the literature .
papers and systematic reviews [ 21 - 25 ] available in the literature , reports of institutional organizations and guidelines , other screening materials ( leaflets , website , brochure ) are carefully assessed in order to collect all the information needed for a balanced and honest tool .
the information also covers controversial topics such as overdetection , overtreatment and the disagreement among scientists about quantification of harms and benefits .
the navigation is personalised , with a " nudging " approach that induces women to become informed on the main matters .
however , women can stop reading whenever they feel ready to decide .
when woman feels she knows enough and is to decide the platform provides a da module listing issues and concerns that can affect their decision .
women are asked to state , the importance of each items , and its impact on their decision .
the quantitative data presented in the da come from the uk panel ( rcts ) and from the euroscreen benefit - harms ratio ( breast cancer mortality , overdetection and false - positive ) , based on an observational study assessing screening program outcomes in europe .
the controversy is presented based on the quantitative estimates of the 2013 cochrane review [ 4 ] .
control the standard brochure combines the best information from the three participating centers' brochures .
numbers of lives saved thanks to screening , false - positive cases , and over - diagnosed tumors are reported .
the brochure gives no information on the controversy about mammography screening .
consent and data collection eligible women will be invited to participate by their screening center through an ad - hoc letter providing information regarding the trial and how to access the web platform .
after 30 - 45 days , the standard screening invitation , reporting the appointment for mammography , will be sent to women with a reminder letter to solicit participation in the trial .
women agreeing to participate will enter the web platform , register themselves , sign informed consent and complete a baseline questionnaire covering the topics reported in table 1 .
after that , they will be randomized to the intervention or the control group .
women who do not complete the questionnaire will be reminded by e - mail one week after they registered and signed informed consent .

finally , a reminder link and thankyou will be emailed to all women who initially agreed to participate .
study endpoints in order to draft the questionnaires related to the primary and secondary endpoints , a systematic review of the literature was done , searching for rcts on da dealing with mammography screening .
two independent reviewers examined the literature , and nine trials were included .
a comparative analysis of the tools used in these trials was presented and discussed with partners and the scientific committee , identifying areas and items for consideration .
the questionnaire items were translated into italian through a multistep process employing standardized methodology .
briefly , one professional translator and two members of the coordinating center ( ar , cc ) produced three independent italian translations .
after discussion , a shared italian version was produced .
this version was then evaluated by partners ( epidemiologists with experience in breast cancer screening , experts in communication , researchers ) in terms of the use of simple , correct language .
the preliminary italian version of the questionnaires was tested on a small group of women in order to evaluate its clarity , understandability and length .
at the end of this , a final version was established .
primary endpoints informed choice will be measured according to the three - dimensional framework of marteau et al .
[ 26 ] , which covers knowledge , attitude and intention .
the statistical hypothesis for the primary endpoint is superiority .
the trial is designed to detect a 10 % difference between the control and the intervention group , according to the literature [ 24 , 25 ] .
knowledge will be measured using a questionnaire developed on the basis of literature [ 24 , 25 ] structured in 13 questions with multiple - choice answers , with two to three options .
ten questions are qualitative and three numerical .
each correct answer will receive one point .
the maximum total score is 13 out of 13 .
the score and threshold to reach " adequate knowledge " were decided beforehand , following the approach described in the literature [ 24 , 25 ] .
a score of 8 out of 13 ( about 60 %) or higher will be considered " adequate knowledge " .
attitude will be measured on a scale used in the literature [ 24 , 25 ] , consisting of six items with five response options from 1 to 5 , with a total score from 6 to 30 .
for informed choice , we set the threshold for a positive attitude at 24 , and so a score below < 24 means a negative attitude .
intention to be screened will be measured using one item with five responses : definitely will , likely to , unsure , not likely to , definitely will not .
for informed choice , we classified " definitely will " and " likely to " as positive intentions .
this item will be collected both at the end of the information session on the web , and in the follow - up questionnaire .
if there is no consistency between the two answers , the answer to the follow - up questionnaire will be considered conclusive .
informed choice will be assessed as a dichotomous outcome .
a woman with adequate knowledge and consistent attitudes and intentions ( positive or negative ) will be considered as expressing informed choice .
secondary endpoints the participation rate in the breast cancer screening program will be assessed as the percentages of women who participate in the trial , in the intervention and the control groups .
the statistical hypothesis for the secondary endpoint is non - inferiority .
satisfaction with the information given ( intervention and control group ) will be measured using eight items regarding length , quantity , clarity , balance , helpfulness of the information in making a decision , and willingness to recommend it to other women , with a three - point scale .
the time spent on the pages in the web da and the web brochure will be assessed with pickwick software .
only for the web da , the number of pages visited , frequency of access and level of detail reached will be calculated with the same software .
decisional conflict will be assessed using the validated and widely used decisional conflict scale - sure version [ 27 ] .
this four - item scale will assess the woman 's knowledge of the options available , clarity about the benefits and risks most important for them , adequate level of support , and conviction about the best choice .
since no italian translation of this scale is available , the scale will be translated for this trial .
the perceived risk of breast cancer will be assessed using one item with five verbal response categories ranging from " much lower " to " much higher " than the average .
sample size the primary analysis will compare the proportion of women who make an informed choice , using the chi - squared test in the two study groups .
based on previous studies [ 22 , 25 ] we judge an absolute difference of 10 % as the minimum important difference for the sample size calculation .
assuming that one of the group proportion is 50 % , in order to achieve 80 % power to detect a group difference with a two - sided significance level of 5 % , we require 816 women at follow - up. allowing for an estimated response rate of 15 % and early drop - out of one - third of initial participants , we will invite 8160 women to take part .
if the null hypothesis related to the primary endpoint is rejected , the first of the secondary endpoints will be analysed with a non - inferiority hypothesis .
the power of the analysis for this non - inferiority test - with one - sided tail - will be considered depending on the participation rate at breast cancer screening .
data analysis we will conduct a descriptive analysis for the trial participants .
possible baseline differences between trial arms will be statistically tested .
for the primary endpoint , statistical analysis will be done on an intention - to - treat basis : all the women randomised , compliant to follow - up will be included in the analysis in the group assigned at randomization .
the impact of the web da on the primary endpoint will be analysed using the chi - square test .
for secondary endpoints , we will use the chi - square test to analyse binary endpoints and a two - sided t - test for continuous endpoints , with a significance level of 5 % .
we will use sas statistical software , version 9.2 .
ethical approval , dissemination and trial registration the study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki .
ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the coordinating center , and from the ethics committee of each participating center .
participants will give online informed consent after reading complete , clear information regarding the nature and purpose of the trial .
any modifications or amendments that affect the conduct of the trial will be documented , resubmitted for approval to the ethics committees , and reported in further publications .
to ensure data privacy , confidentiality will be assured by coding each women enrolled , through assignment of a unique identification number .
the trial is registered with the clinicaltrials.gov registry ( nct03097653 ) on march 16 , 2017 .
results will be published in a public registry ( clinicaltrials.gov ) , in peer - reviewed scientific journals , and disseminated to lay people .
according to the recommendations of the international committee of medical journal editors only persons directly involved in the trial will be designated as authors .
discussion this project will develop a new model for providing high - quality health information to women invited to participate in breast cancer screening .
the model employs an interactive process in which the woman can choose the kind and depth of information she wants over time , and covers topics highly recommended by women , researchers and public entities for to communicating the benefits and harms of screening .
these will include over - diagnosis and controversies regarding breast cancer screening , scantily covered in communications aimed at women invited to participate in screening .
an open - source software for a web platform draws on innovative information and communication technologies , incorporating all the features and functions in the model .
the rct will test the efficacy of this web da in increasing informed choice on breast cancer screening , providing a tool which , if valuable , could be used in the future by women in other italian screening programs .
the model , the software and the web platform will be free of charge and publicly usable ( under a creative common licence ) .
the transferability of the model and platform to other settings , other countries and other cancer screenings ( for example , colon cancer screening ) could be assessed as a further step .
pitfalls and caveats the proposed web platform with its multilevel information may be too innovative for the target women , and this could influence participation in the trial .
recent data , however , show that about 60 % [ 28 ] of the italian population has regular access to the web , and this continuously increases .
this figure helped us decide to develop a web platform to inform women .
in this trial , women aged 45 - 52 years will be enrolled , and may be less representative of the older segments of the population .
nevertheless , with the large number of women involved in the screening , the trial should in any case recruit a significant number of cases .
there is also the possibility that the trial falsifies the hypothesis and does not show any superiority of the web da over the web platform brochure .
however , the trial will collect a rich set of data that will be useful to improve the new model .

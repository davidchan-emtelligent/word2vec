beta - glucans ( bg ) are abundant polysaccharides of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall ( sc cw ) , an industry byproduct .
they have immuno - stimulatory properties upon engagement of dectin - 1 ( clec7a ) , their main receptor on particular immune cells , and they actually become of great interest because of their preventive or therapeutic potentials .
zymosan , a crude extract of sc cw was studied as a prototypic bg , despite its miscellaneous pamps content .
here , we examined the response of murine wild type or clec7a - / - bone marrow - derived macrophages ( bmdm ) to products with increasing bg content ( 15 , 65 or 75 %) and compared their effects with those of other dectin - 1 ligands .
the enrichment process removed tlr ligands while preserving dectin - 1 activity .
the most enriched extracts have very low nfkappab activity and triggered low amounts of cytokine production in contrast with crude products like zymosan and bg15 .
furthermore , myd88 - / - bmdm did not produce tnfalpha in response to crude sc cw extracts , whereas their response to bg - enriched extracts was unaffected , suggesting that bg alone are not able to initiate cytokine secretion .
although sc cw - derived bg stimulated the late and strong expression of csf2 in a dectin - 1 - dependent manner , they remain poor inducers of chemokine and cytokine production in murine macrophages .

introduction for centuries , fungal cell wall components have been commonly used in traditional oriental medicine [ 1 ] , and their benefits are mainly attributed to beta - glucans ( bg ) .
these polysaccharides have recently become of interest in western countries , because of their activity on innate immune cells and their potential therapeutic applications .
indeed , bg have various valuable properties including antitumor [ 2 ] , antidiabetic , and anti - microbial activity against viral , bacterial and fungal diseases ( reviewed by chen et al [ 3 ]) .
strikingly , lentinan has been shown to improve the survival rate of japanese patients with gastric and colorectal cancers [ 4 ] .
given the various potential health benefits attributed to bg , many dietary supplements containing bg are available .
bg are the most abundant polysaccharides of the fungal cell wall .
they are intermingled with chitins ( polymers of n - acetylglucosamine ) that are located near the plasma membrane , and mannans that are anchored to the outer cell wall , all of which are interspersed with glycoproteins [ 5 ] .
beta - glucans are polymers of glucose and have a backbone of linear beta ( 1,3 ) - linked d - glucose molecules with beta ( 1,6 ) - linked side chains of diverse sizes occurring at different intervals along the backbone .
although bg can be extracted from mushrooms , oat , barley , seaweed , algae , bacteria and yeast , the composition of the cell wall varies greatly within and between species and the length and types of linkage also differ [ 6,7 ] .
this heterogeneity of structure , conformation , source and even nature ( soluble or particulate ) among bg influences the biological response of immune cells .
this may explain conflicting findings regarding the effects of bg in human or animal models .
moreover , the effects of one preparation of ' beta - glucans' are often inappropriately extrapolated to all beta - glucans , and ' beta - glucans' need to be characterized to better define the type of immune response that they elicit .
indeed , the total bg - content of extracts used for investigation is rarely determined .
despite the complexity of bg , several molecules [ 8,9 ] including complement receptor 3 ( cr3 ) , lactosylceramide ( laccer ) , scavenger receptor ( srs ) and dectin - 1 [ 10,11 ] , recognize bg on the cell surface of macrophages , monocytes , dendritic cells , nk cells and neutrophils [ 12 ] .
so far , most studies designed to investigate the activities of bg have used zymosan [ 13 ] , which is considered as a source of bg. however , the bg content of zymosan rarely exceeds 50 % [ 2,14 ] , which is similar to the bg content of the sc cw [ 15,16 ] .
other components are also present that are pamps for several other prrs including tlrs on innate immune cells .
goodridge et al recently demonstrated that zymosan particles strongly stimulate macrophages to produce tnfalpha , as a result of dectin - 1 , which activates nfkappab [ 17,18 ] .
moreover , dectin - 1 and tlr2 work together to enhance tlr2 - mediated nfkappab signaling and the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 19 ] .
nevertheless , it remains unclear how dectin - 1 interacts with sc bg compounds .
the main challenging issue of this study was to determine whether dectin - 1 is involved to the macrophage response triggered by a series of three increasingly bg - enriched cw extracted from the same strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae .
contrary to conventional bg wisdom , we found that sc cw extracts highly - enriched in bg do not elicit nfkappab activity and that dectin - 1 - dependent - cytokine production in response to these compounds is very much lower than that induced by crude compounds like zymosan .
these unpurified products have the capacity to induce tlr2 and tlr4 activities resulting in strong signaling via myd88 and nfkappab .
therefore , our data show that the robust response elicited by zymosan is not strictly caused by its bg content .
altogether our findings demonstrate that bg are poor inducers of cytokine production in murine macrophages .
materials and methods reagents rpmi 1640 glutamax ( tm ) , dmem glutamax ( tm ) , pbs , non - essential amino acids ( neaa ) , sodium pyruvate and antibiotics for cell culture such as penicillin - streptomycin ( pen - strep ( tm )) , gentamicin ( tm ) , normocin ( tm ) and zeocin ( tm ) were purchased from gibco ( life technologies ) .
fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) was provided by eurobio , france .
the dectin - 1 and tlr ligands used as controls were from invivogen .
the following compounds were compared with sc bg compounds as described below : zymosan ( zym ) , particulate ( wgpd ) and soluble glucan - enriched compound ( wgps ) and curdlan ( curd ) , a linear beta1,3 - glucan extracted from alcaligenes faecalis .
the synthetic triacylated lipoprotein pam3csk4 and ultrapure lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) from e. coli o111 : b4 both purchased from invivogen ( france ) .
bg compounds of interest were extracted from the same strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae ( sc ) owned by phileo - lesaffre animal care .
the crude extract originally contained a total bg content of 15 % ( bg15 ) and was further enriched using several methods to generate two compounds , bg65 and bg75 , with a total bg content of 65 % and 75 % , respectively .
the bg15 extraction method from s. cerevisiae was mainly the same as for zymosan preparation [ 20 ] and resulted in " ghost " cells with an average particle diameter of 3 mum deprived of nucleic acid [ 14 ] .
bg65 was obtained from a suspension of bg15 ( 14 %) by hot alkaline hydrolysis ( 4 % naoh , 90degreesc , 2 h ) to remove mannoproteins and lipids .
bg75 , the most enriched sc cw , was prepared from a suspension of bg65 ( 14 %) which was submitted to an enzymatic hydrolysis ( amylase and amyloglucosidase ) to eliminate the contaminant glycogen .
both products were then lyophilized ( dry matter > 94 %) .
the bg content of each sc cw preparation was determined using the enzymatic yeast beta - glucan kit ( k - ebhlg , megazyme , ireland ) and the total amount of glucose released was measured by hplc .
dry powders were suspended in cell culture medium at 10 mg / ml and were then dispersed by pipetting 20 times up and down through a syringe fitted with a 26g needle to optimize bioavailability .
composition of bg extracts is presented in table 1 .
according to the manufacturer , wgpd and curdlan used in this study contain more than 75 % and 80 % of bg , respectively .
concerning zymosan , the content in bg did not differ from a yeast cell wall and is comprised between 50 and 57 % ( percentage of dry matter ) [ 14 ] .

individual cytokine detection kits were also used to quantify mouse tnfalpha , il - 6 and il - 1beta ( biolegend , ozyme - france ) , and gm - csf ( r & d systems , france ) .
rt qpcr gene expression analysis total rna was purified with the rneasy mini kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
rna was quantified with a nanodrop ( r ) 1000 spectrophotometer and nanodrop 1000.3.7 software and rna quality was assessed using the agilent rna 6000 nano kit on bioanalyzer and 2100 expert software ( agilent technologies , santa clara , usa ) at the get - trix platform ( inra , toulouse , france ) .

luminol powder ( sigma - aldrich ) was suspended in dmso and then diluted 1000 - fold in cell culture medium according to the supplier 's recommendations .
immediately before ros were measured , supernatant was removed and luminol and bg products were added simultaneously to each well .
the chemiluminescence of each well was continuously acquired for 2 h post - stimulation in a tecan infinite 200 microplate reader .
to assess the contribution of cr3 to ros production , wt cells were preincubated with anti - cd11b ( alphacd11b ) mab ( m1 / 70 ) or a control rat igg2b mab ( biolegend , ozyme - france ) for 1 h and were then stimulated with bg compounds .
isolation of bone marrow neutrophils and chemotaxis assay murine bone marrow neutrophils were freshly isolated from femurs and tibias with percoll .
red blood cells were lysed by ack and bm cells were resuspended in a 62 % v / v gradient of percoll in hbss - prep ( constituted by ca - mg - free hbss supplemented with 0.5 % heat - inactivated fbs ) and centrifuged for 30 min at 1000g .
the cloudy pellet of neutrophils was washed twice in hbss - prep .
purity and viability were estimated by flow cytometry and were found to be > 90 % and > 85 % , respectively .
neutrophils ( 5x105cells / well ) were seeded in the upper chambers of a 96 - well transwell plate with a 3 - mum pore size polycarbonate membrane ( corning , lifescience , usa ) .
the lower chamber contained supernatants collected from a culture of wt and clec7a - / - c57bl / 6 ( and wt dba / 2 in s4a fig ) bmdm pretreated for 8 h with sc bg compounds ( 100 mug / ml ) .
after a 30 min incubation in a cell culture incubator ( 37degreesc , 5 % co2 ) , the upper chambers were removed and the absolute number of migrated neutrophils was determined by flow cytometry using macsquant analyzer .
assessment of phagocytosis and bactericidal activity gfp - expressing mutants of the s. aureus hg001 strain were prepared as described previously by accarias et al [ 21 ] .
to assess the phagocytosis and bactericidal activity of bmdm , cells were first stimulated 8 h with 100 mug / ml of sc cw compounds ( bg15 , bg65 and bg75 ) in 24 - well plate ( 5x105cells / well ) as described below and then infected at an moi = 10 with hg001 - gfp bacteria for 1 h ( 37degreesc , 5 % co2 ) .
the supernatant was removed and cells were washed twice with warm pbs .
warm complete rpmi supplemented with gentamicin ( tm ) was then added for 4 or 16 h. at the end of the incubation , cells were lysed with 0.1 % triton x - 100 pbs and intracellular bacteria were labeled with propidium iodide ( pi ) ( immunochemistry technologies , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .

each condition was performed in triplicate .
statistical significance was assessed using a two - tailed unpaired student 's t - test with a threshold set at p < 0.05 .
mean values shown with different letters on plots are significantly different .
results nfkappab activity in murine macrophages varies according to the degree of bg enrichment we used raw macrophage reporter cell line to examine the effect of two bg - enriched sc cw extracts as compared to other bg sources on the nfkappab pathway ( table 1 ) .
at a concentration of 100 mug / ml , sc compounds enriched in bg ( bg65 and bg75 ) were very much weaker inducers of nfkappab / ap - 1 activity than crude extract ( bg15 ) or zymosan ( fig 1 ) .
similarly , nfkappab / ap - 1 activity was low in raw macrophages stimulated with a commercial source of purified beta ( 1 - 3 )( 1 - 6 ) - glucan , wgpd as a control which confirms that at least two different sources of enriched bg are poor inducers of nfkappab / ap - 1 activity .
furthermore , soluble wgp from saccharomyces cerevisiae failed to activate nfkappab / ap - 1 in these cells .
conversely , curdlan , the linear beta ( 1,3 ) - glucan extracted from alcaligenes faecalis , strongly activated nfkappab / ap - 1 .
interestingly , in cells treated with a lower concentration of compounds ( 10 mug / ml ) , only zymosan and not bg15 and curdlan , was able to activate nfkappab / ap - 1 , indicating that zymosan was more potent to stimulate nfkappab and ap - 1 pathway .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0148464.g001 fig 1 saccharomyces cerevisiae ( sc ) extracts enriched in beta - glucan ( bg ) are much weaker inducers of nfkappab / ap - 1 activity in raw - blue ( tm ) macrophages than other sources of bg. nfkappab / ap - 1 activity was determined by a colorimetric enzyme assay using raw - blue ( tm ) macrophages as reporter cell line .
cells were treated for 16 h with 100 or 10 mug / ml of various sc bg extracts ( bg15 , bg65 and bg75 ) or with zymosan , curdlan , dispersible wgpd and soluble wgps as controls .
data are expressed as the mean od 650nm +/ - sd of three independent experiments performed in triplicate .
mean values not sharing the same letter are significantly different according to the student 's t - test ( p < 0.05 ) .
comparisons are shown for bg compounds used at 100 mug / ml. to confirm that highly - enriched bg do not activate nfkappab / ap - 1 , we tested a large range of concentrations in reporter cells and found that higher concentrations of the enriched compounds bg65 and bg75 did not either stimulate nfkappab / ap - 1 activity ( data in s1 fig ) , whereas , bg15 and zymosan induced nfkappab / ap - 1 activity to the same extent as 100 ng / ml of ultrapure lps .
taken together , these data strongly suggest that bg alone cannot consistently activate nfkappab / ap - 1 .
sc cw extracts enriched in bg activate dectin - 1 but not tlr2 / 4 given that particulate bg - enriched sc cw , but not crude extracts of sc cw , failed to induce substantial nfkappab / ap - 1 activity , we next investigated whether these extracts stimulated the two main tlrs , using tlr2 and tlr4 reporter cell lines .
consistent with previous data , sc crude extracts like zymosan and bg15 , but also curdlan , activated tlr2 to a similar extent as 100 ng / ml of pam3csk4 , a synthetic ligand of the tlr2 receptor ( fig 2a ) .
conversely , the bg - enriched extracts bg65 and bg75 as well as wgpd did not activate tlr2 , suggesting that beta ( 1 - 3 ) - glucans but not beta ( 1 - 6 )( 1 - 3 ) - glucans interact with tlr2 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0148464.g002 fig 2 enrichment of bg from yeast cell wall extracts strongly abolishes tlr2 / 4 - related nfkappab / ap - 1 activities conversely to dectin - 1 .
( a - c ) hek - blue ( tm ) - htlr2 , - htlr4 and hdectin - 1 cells were incubated with serially diluted sc bg cell wall extracts ( bg15 , bg65 and bg75 ) or their bg controls ( zymosan , curdlan , dispersible and soluble wgp ) for 16 h in culture medium containing the reporter reagent ( 37degreesc , 5 % co2 ) .
each cell line was stimulated with a 10 - fold serial dilution ( from 100 ng / ml to 0.001 ng / ml ) of control ligand , pam3csk4 for hek - blue ( tm ) - htlr2 and ultrapure lps for hek - blue ( tm ) - htlr4 , respectively as shown in the panels on the right of a and b. the nfkappab / ap - 1 - related activity of tlr2 , tlr4 and dectin - 1 was assessed in supernatants by a colorimetric assay .
the od value of a blank control , which corresponds to the od value of hek - blue detection medium , was subtracted from the od values of samples .
the results are presented as od 650 nm values and are representative of three independent experiments .
similarly , the stimulation of hek - blue ( tm ) - tlr4 cells with zymosan , curdlan , and to a lesser extent bg15 , induced tlr4 signaling to a similar extent as 100 ng / ml of the positive control , ultrapure lps ; however , this was not true for highly - enriched bg compounds ( bg65 , bg75 and wgpd ) ( fig 2b ) .
using similar assay with hek - htlr9 reporter cells , we completely rule out the presence of remaining dna from yeast cells in crude bg15 , zymosan , curdlan and enriched - bg compounds ( s2 fig ) .
we next evaluated the ability of each compound to stimulate dectin - 1 activity using the same approach .
at the assayed concentrations ( 1 - 100 mug / ml ) , dectin - 1 was activated by bg65 , bg75 and to a lesser extent by bg15 and zymosan particles in a dose - dependent manner ( fig 2c ) .
conversely , dectin - 1 activity was much lower in curdlan and wgpd , and soluble wgp did not activate dectin - 1 at all .
strikingly , concentrations higher than 100 mug / ml for bg65 and bg75 provided saturated signals ( data not shown ) .
these data indicate that the purification process was efficient at removing the tlr2 / 4 activities and dectin - 1 activity is correlated with the degree of bg enrichment .
tnfalpha production in sc cw products treated - macrophages correlates with their reported nfkappab activity our results suggest that nfkappab / ap - 1 activation in macrophages treated by sc crude extracts or curdlan is directly related to the ability of these molecules to stimulate tlr2 / 4 ; therefore , we examined whether raw - blue ( tm ) macrophages also produce the nfkappab - associated pro - inflammatory cytokine , tnfalpha .
consistent with the data presented above ( fig 1 ) , tnfalpha production was highly correlated with nfkappab activity .
indeed , only a small amount of tnfalpha ( less than 1 ng / ml ) was detected in the supernatant of cells treated with the highly - enriched sc cw extracts , bg65 , bg75 and wgpd , whereas at 100 mug / ml , bg15 , zymosan and curdlan stimulate the production of more than 6 ng / ml of tnfalpha ( fig 3a ) .
the 10 - fold dilution of bg15 , curdlan and to a lesser extent , zymosan , significantly diminished the cytokine production .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0148464.g003 fig 3 murine macrophages treated with extracts enriched in bg produce less tnfalpha than those treated with unpurified sc cell wall extracts .
( a ) raw - blue ( tm ) macrophages were treated with 100 or 10 mug / ml of sc bg extracts ( bg15 , bg65 and bg75 ) or control ( zymosan , curdlan , dispersible wgpd and soluble wgps ) for 16 h and tnfalpha was then quantified by elisa .
comparisons are shown for bg compounds used at 100 mug / ml .
( b - c ) bmdm from c57bl / 6 mice were subcultured in 96 - well plates .
( b ) cells were stimulated for 1 , 4 , 8 , 16 or 24 h with 100 mug / ml of sc bg extracts ( bg15 , bg65 and bg75 ) or control ( curdlan , dispersible wgpd and soluble wgps ) .
supernatants were collected immediately after incubation .
( c ) cells were incubated for 8 h with a 3 - fold serial dilution from 1000 to 10 mug / ml of bg - purified compounds ( bg15 , bg65 and bg75 ) .
supernatants were harvested immediately after incubation .
( a - c ) tnfalpha was measured using elisa and the data are expressed as the mean +/ - sd of three independent experiments performed in triplicate .
mean values not sharing the same letter are significantly different according to the student 's test ( p < 0.05 ) .
( d ) immortalized bmdm ( ibmdm ) from wt and myd88 - / - mice were subcultured in 96 - well plates and stimulated for 8 h with 100 mug / ml of sc bg extracts ( bg15 , bg65 and bg75 ) or control ( zymosan and dispersible wgpd ) .
lps ( 100 ng / ml ) was used as a positive control of myd88 activation .
supernatants were harvested immediately after each incubation time to quantify tnfalpha by elisa .
data are expressed as the mean +/ - sd of two independent experiments performed in triplicate .
mean values not sharing the same letter are significantly different according to the student 's t - test ( p < 0.05 ) .
after having assessed the biological effects of sc bg compounds on the raw cell line , we next focused on primary murine macrophages ( bmdm ) .
we first performed a time - course assay to determine the optimal duration of exposure to bg compounds .
bmdm produced lower amounts of tnfalpha than raw - blue ( tm ) cells , but the response to bg compounds was highly correlated between the two cellular models ( fig 3b ) .
moreover , this experiment confirmed that regardless of the incubation time , macrophages incubated with highly - enriched sc bg compounds or wgp produce much lower amounts of tnfalpha than those stimulated with bg15 , zymosan or curdlan ( fig 3b ) .
thus , cells incubated for a longer time with enriched compounds do not produce more cytokine .
for all compounds , tnfalpha production began at 4 h and generally increased with time at a rate depending on the bg source .
zymosan triggered a strong , early and long - lasting response in macrophages which was higher than that of all other bg extracts tested .
indeed , the release of tnfalpha in response to sc cw extracts enriched in bg peaked at 8 - 16 h of incubation and remained low until the end of the time course experiment , in contrast to crude sc cw extracts ( fig 3b ) .
therefore , 8 h is the incubation time that leads to maximal cytokine production in response to sc cw extracts .
we then examined how the concentration of sc bg influences tnfalpha production in bmdm ( fig 3c ) .
at each concentration tested , more tnfalpha was released in response to bg15 than either bg65 or bg75 ( from 2 - fold higher at 1000 mug / ml to 15 - fold higher at 100 mug / ml ) .
surprisingly , at high concentrations ( 300 and 1000 mug / ml ) , bg75 was more potent to induce tnfalpha production than bg65 whereas no difference was evidenced between these two bg - enriched compounds at lower concentrations tested ( from 100 to 10 mug / ml ) .
the largest difference in the response of bmdm to bg15 and bg75 occurred at a concentration of 100 mug / ml ; therefore we used this concentration in the rest of the study .
given that crude sc cw extracts strongly activated tlr2 and tlr4 , we used myd88 - deficient macrophages to examine the involvement of the myd88 - signaling tlrs in tnfalpha production ( fig 3d ) .
wt ibmdm produced more tnfalpha than raw - blue ( tm ) cells or bmdm , but the response to each compound was highly correlated between the cell types ( fig 3b and 3c ) and as expected , the amounts of tnfalpha produced in wt ibmdm was inversely correlated with bg content .
indeed , wt ibmdm treated with zymosan , bg15 and lps , produced large amounts of tnfalpha , in contrast to those treated with wgpd or sc cw extracts enriched in bg ( bg65 and bg75 ) .
the high production of tnfalpha induced by zymosan , bg15 and the positive control lps was significantly impaired , and even absent in myd88 - deficient ibmdm .
furthermore , loss of myd88 had a little or no effect on the response of cells to bg65 or bg75 , which further suggests that the activation of these cells by crude extracts of sc cw mainly depends on tlr pathways .
altogether , these results show that increasing the purity of bg in sc cw extracts impairs the production of cytokines by macrophages .
surface dectin - 1 expression and the capacity of response to bg it has been previously reported that bg does not signal in bmdm in contrast to peritoneal macrophages or dendritic cells due to a low dectin - 1 expression and defaults in its signaling pathway [ 18 ] .
we first compared the dectin - 1 expression on the surface of various cell types including resident peritoneal macrophages ( rpm ) , thioglycollate - elicited macrophages ( tepm ) and bmdm , isolated from 3 murine genetic backgrounds ( wt or clec7a - / - c57bl / 6 and dba / 2 ) .
both freshly isolated rpm and tepm , but also bmdm from wt c57bl / 6 and dba / 2 mice expressed high surface levels of dectin - 1 in a comparison with clec7a - / - c57bl / 6 as a control ( fig 4a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0148464.g004 fig 4 murine primary macrophages including peritoneal macrophages and bmdm express similar levels of the bg receptor dectin - 1 and exhibit the same ability to respond to sc bg extracts .
( a - b ) freshly isolated 4 - days thioglycollate - elicited peritoneal macrophages ( tepm ) , resident peritoneal macrophages ( rpm ) and bmdm from wt and clec7a - / - c57bl / 6 , and dba / 2 mice , and the macrophages cell line raw - blue ( tm ) , used as control , were assessed for surface expression of dectin - 1 by flow cytometry ( macsquant ( r ) , miltenyi biotech , germany ) .
doublets of cells were excluded at the beginning of the acquisition and a 7 - aad staining was used to discriminate death cells .
the surface expression of dectin - 1 was determined for each type of primary macrophages on cd115 + cells .
( a ) data are expressed as the frequency of dectin - 1 + among cd115 + cells .
( b ) the mean of fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) of dectin - 1 was established on cd115 + cells .
results are presented as the mean +/ - sd mfi of dectin - 1 corrected by either the mfi of isotype control for raw macrophages , or the mfi of clec7a - / - c57bl / 6 for wt c57bl / 6 or dba / 2 primary macrophages .
( c ) remaining tepm and bmdm from wt and clec7a - / - c57bl / 6 mice isolated from these experiments were subcultured and stimulated with 100 mug / ml of crude or enriched sc bg cw extracts ( bg15 , bg65 or bg75 ) or zymosan for 8 h ( 37degreesc , 5 % co2 ) .
supernatants were collected immediately after incubation and were assessed for tnfalpha production by elisa .
results are shown as the mean +/ - sd. all data are representative of three mice per group from three independent experiments performed in triplicate .
* p < 0.05 ( two - tailed unpaired student 's t - test ) ; mean values not sharing the same letter are significantly different .
expression of endogenous dectin - 1 was very similar between the raw - blue ( tm ) cell line macrophage and primary cells , as indicated by measurement of the mean fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) on cd115 + macrophages ( fig 4b ) .
furthermore , surface expression was slightly higher on rpm from c57bl / 6 than rpm from dba / 2 whereas no difference could be observed between the two backgrounds on other macrophage types .
we next compared the ability of macrophages from the different sources to respond to crude or enriched sc bg compounds .
crude bg extracts bg15 and especially zymosan , induced higher tnfalpha release than did enriched bg65 or bg75 ( fig 4c ) .
dectin - 1 - deficiency affects the production of tnfalpha in both cell types although the difference is higher with zymosan , and with bg - enriched extracts , a 10 - fold diminution was noted in tepm and bmdm ( for bg65 , 708 versus 61 pg / ml for tepm , and 40 versus 6 pg / ml for bmdm in wt and clec7a - / - cells , respectively ) .
similarly , for bg75 , tnfalpha production was 1193 versus 178 pg / ml in tepm , and 89 versus 20 pg / ml for bmdm in wt and clec7a - / - cells , respectively .
these data confirm the above description of low tnfalpha production triggered by highly - enriched bg compounds whatever the macrophage cell type .
bg - enriched sc cw extracts stimulate the late clec7a - dependent expression of csf2 we next performed a high - throughput qpcr experiment to investigate the differential effects of crude and bg - enriched sc cw extracts on dectin - 1 pathway in bmdm .
we analyzed the expression of several genes in wt and clec7a - / - bmdm stimulated with sc bg compounds for different amounts of time .
as expected , in both genetic backgrounds , bg15 induced the early and strong upregulation of pro - inflammatory but also anti - inflammatory genes ( fig 5 ) .
the expression of cytokine genes such as il1b , il6 and il10 peaked between 4 and 8 h post - stimulation and then decreased until 16 h post - stimulation , whereas that of tnfa was maximal from 4 h post - treatment .
surprisingly , tnfa was upregulated by sc bg - enriched compounds , albeit to a lesser extent than by bg15 .
the monocyte - attractant chemokine ccl2 was upregulated at 4 h post - incubation and its expression was maintained until 16 h in wt bmdm incubated with bg15 but decreased in cells treated with bg65 or bg75 , showing that the expression kinetics varied depending on the gene products .
interestingly , bg - dependent gene expression was severely impaired in clec7a - / - bmdm .
indeed , the early induction of il10 , il6 , tnfa , il1b and csf2 gene expression observed in wt macrophages was partially ( bg15 ) or mainly abrogated ( bg65 and bg75 ) in clec7a - / - cells .
intriguingly , the kinetics of tnfa , il1b , and ccl2 gene expression differed between wt and clec7a - / - cells .
the expression of tnfa and il1b was delayed in clec7a - / - cells treated with bg15 , and at 8 h the expression of these genes was lower in clec7a - / - than in wt cells .
the expression ofccl2 was also delayed in clec7a - / - macrophages treated with bg15 , but this gene was still expressed at 16 h post - incubation and was even higher in deficient cells .
interestingly , the expression of csf2 in wt and clec7a - / - cells treated with bg15 resembled that of il10 and il6 .
conversely , bg75 and to a lesser extent bg65 , stimulated the late expression of csf2 that was completely absent in clec7a - / - cells .
taken together , these data demonstrate that in wt macrophages , the crude sc cw extract bg15 triggers an earlier and stronger response than the bg - enriched sc cw extracts bg65 and bg75 and , that dectin - 1 is required to initiate the late upregulation of csf2 by bg - enriched compounds .
furthermore , the response of clec7a - / - cells to bg15 was mainly slower and weaker than that of wt cells , indicating that dectin - 1 improves the early inflammatory response in cells stimulated with bg - containing sc cw extracts .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0148464.g005 fig 5 the timing of clec7a - dependent csf2 expression depends on sc bg content .
wt and clec7a ( dectin - 1 ) - / - bmdm were stimulated with sc bg extracts for 4 , 8 or 16 h. after incubation , supernatants were removed and cells were lysed in rlt lysis buffer .
total rna was extracted using the rneasy mini kit and retro - transcribed with the superscript iii first - strand synthesis super mix kit .
the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes was measured by quantitative pcr and normalized with three housekeeping genes ( sdha , rpl9 and hprt1 ) selected with genorm software .
individual quantitative pcr was performed on the lightcycler ( r ) 480 system ( roche , switzerland ) using power sybr green pcr master mix ( applied biosystems ) to confirm the results obtained with the biomark method .
data are expressed as fold change related to the mock value , representative of two experiments performed in triplicate .
we also assessed the secretion of cytokines in the supernatants from wt and clec7a - / - bmdm incubated with crude or bg - enriched sc cw extracts .
consistent with the gene expression profiles of wt bmdm , the crude sc cw extract , bg15 , and zymosan significantly induced the production of all cytokines and chemokines examined ( fig 6 ) .
in contrast , the bg - enriched sc cw extracts , bg65 and bg75 , did not significantly stimulate the secretion of these cytokines and chemokines .
we also incubated wt bmdm with sc cw extracts for longer than 8 h. although levels of gm - csf in bg65 and bg75 - treated cells were higher at 16 and 24 h post - treatment , they remained lower than those triggered by zymosan or bg15 ( data in s3 fig ) .
we also performed similar experiments in clec7a - / - macrophages to investigate the role of the dectin - 1 pathway .
tnfalpha , il - 6 and ccl2 productions were similar in wt and clec7a - / - bmdm stimulated with bg15 or zymosan , but the secretion of il - 1beta , il - 10 and gm - csf was significantly lower in clec7a - / - cells .
similarly , although wt macrophages treated with the enriched sc bg compounds , bg65 and bg75 produced very low amounts of cytokines and chemokines , the production of tnfalpha and ccl2 was significantly lower in clec7a - / - than in wt cells .
no statistical differences were found for il - 6 , il - 10 and il - 1beta comparing clec7a - / - and wt cells response regarding bg65 and bg75 incubation .
altogether , these data suggest that the interaction between bg and dectin - 1 has low stimulatory effects when the crude sc cw extract bg15 and zymosan are used .
these results further suggest that sc cw enriched in bg extracts poorly activate cytokine production in macrophages .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0148464.g006 fig 6 sc cell wall crude products - and zymosan - induced cytokine productions are mainly dectin - 1 - dependent .
wt and clec7a - / - bmdm were stimulated with sc extracts enriched in bg for 8 h. after incubation , cell culture supernatants were harvested and stored at - 20degreesc .
chemokines and cytokines ( tnfalpha , il - 6 , ccl2 , il - 10 and il - 1beta ) were quantified using a customized multiplex assay and gm - csf was measured with a cytokine detection kit .
data are expressed as the mean +/ - sd of three independent experiments performed in triplicate .
mean values not sharing the same letter are significantly different according to the student 's t - test ( p < 0.05 ) .
sc bg - enriched compounds poorly induce neutrophil recruitment via dectin - 1 we found that the various bg compounds tested influence the activation status of macrophages , which probably affects the inflammatory response , and in particular , cell recruitment .
to further characterize the effects of sc cw compounds on the other components of the innate immune system , we first evaluated the chemotactic properties of culture supernatants from bmdm treated with sc cw compounds .
consistent with our previous results , culture supernatants from cells treated with the crude extract bg15 or with zymosan were significantly more chemo - attractant than their counterparts obtained from cells treated with the bg - enriched sc cw extracts , bg65 and bg75 ( fig 7a ) .
bg75 - and bg65 - conditioned medium were slightly more chemoattractant than mock control or medium alone , with a non - significant upward tendency for bg75 - compared to bg65 - conditioned medium .
we used clec7a - / - cells to investigate the involvement of dectin - 1 in this process .
dectin - 1 - deficiency severely altered the chemotactic activity of bg75 - conditioned medium , which had the same effect on clec7a - / - cells as bg65 - conditioned medium , the mock control or medium alone .
conversely , dectin - 1 - deficiency poorly influenced the chemotactic properties of bg15 - or zymosan - conditioned medium , suggesting that the production of chemo - attractants by crude bg15 and zymosan does not depend on dectin - 1 signaling .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0148464.g007 fig 7 sc bg - enriched extracts poorly induce neutrophil recruitment via dectin - 1 but strongly stimulate ros production via cr3 and not dectin - 1 .
( a ) transwell chemotaxis assay to assess the chemotactic activity of supernatants from wt and clec7a - / - bmdm stimulated with sc bg extracts ( bg15 , bg65 and bg75 ) for 8 h. bm neutrophils of wt c57bl / 6 mice ( 5x105cells / well ) were incubated for 30 min at 37degreesc with the supernatants and the neutrophils migrating into the lower chamber of the 96 - well transwell plate were quantified by flow cytometry with an absolute counting system .
control wells containing medium ( rpmi supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fbs ) were included in the chemotaxis assay .
data are expressed as the mean +/ - sd of three independent experiments performed in triplicate .
( b ) c57bl / 6 mice ( n = 4 / group ) were challenged ip with 100 mug of bg15 , bg75 or zymosan under 500 mul of pbs .
after 6 h of incubation , peritoneal cells were collected and the number of recruited neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were assessed by flow cytometry as described in material and methods section .
data are presented as the mean +/ - sd of four individual mice measurements and are representative of two independent experiments .
( c ) wt and clec7a - / - bmdm were stimulated with sc bg extracts for 8 h. after incubation , cell culture supernatants were collected and stored at - 20degreesc .
cxcl1 and cxcl2 were quantified using a customized multiplex assay .
data are expressed as the mean +/ - sd of three independent experiments performed in triplicate .
( a - c ) mean values not sharing the same letter are significantly different according to the student 's test ( p < 0.05 ) .
( c - d ) wt ( d - e ) and clec7a - / - bmdm ( e ) were subcultured in 96 - well plates and incubated simultaneously with luminol and 100 mug / ml of sc bg extracts ( bg15 , bg65 and bg75 ) or control ( zymosan , curdlan , dispersible wgpd and soluble wgps ) .
ros production was assessed immediately from the intensity of luminescence in each well , which was measured every 5 min for 2 h with a tecan plate reader .
( d ) results are expressed as the mean of luminescence intensity +/ - sd of two independent experiments performed in triplicate .
( e ) wt bmdm were incubated for 1 h with leaf ( tm ) anti - mouse cd11b ( alphacd11b ) or with its rat control isotype igg2a mab and were then treated with bg products .
data were recorded into prism 6 ( graphpad software , san diego , ca ) and analyzed by the area under curve ( auc ) method .
levels of ros produced by alphaigg2a - wt bmdm were comparable to those of untreated cells .
results are expressed as the mean of three independent experiments performed in triplicate .
mean values not sharing the same letter are significantly different according to the student 's t - test ( p < 0.05 ) .
to confirm these findings , we also performed the chemotaxis assay with supernatants of bmdm differentiated from dba / 2 mouse bone - marrow precursors because dba / 2 expresses full - length dectin - 1 whereas the c57bl / 6 expresses a truncated splice variant [ 24,25 ] .
supernatants from dba / 2 cells treated with bg15 or bg65 recruited significantly more neutrophils than those from c57bl / 6 cells treated with these compounds whereas the migration of neutrophils was similar in response to supernatants derived from c57bl / 6 and dba / 2 cells treated with bg75 ( data in s4a fig ) .
furthermore , we assessed the severity of the peritoneal inflammation using the cell number ratio between recruited neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in a peritonitis model after bg15 , bg75 or zymosan challenge , as recently reported by lastrucci et al [ 26 ] .
for both zymosan and bg15 , the cell recruitment was significantly dominated by neutrophils ( p < 0.01 ) which attested to an intense inflammatory reaction ( fig 7b ) .
in contrast , bg75 intra - peritoneal injection induced much lower neutrophil infiltration .
these observations are clearly consistent with our in vitro results showing that crude bg15 and zymosan are strong inducers of inflammation in macrophages .
to confirm these results , we quantified the two major chemokines involved in neutrophil recruitment , cxcl1 ( kc ) and cxcl2 ( mip - 2 ) in culture supernatants of macrophages stimulated in vitro by sc bg compounds .
consistent with our previous observations , bmdm treated with the crude sc cw extract bg15 or zymosan produced higher amounts of these chemokines than those treated with the bg - enriched compounds , bg65 and bg75 ( fig 7c ) .
again , bg75 tended to induce higher amounts of chemokine and recruit slightly more cells than bg65 - conditioned medium .
intriguingly , dectin - 1 - deficiency did not significantly influence chemokine production in cells treated with bg15 , but strongly impaired cxcl2 by bmdm treated with bg - enriched sc cw compounds .
together , these results further suggest that crude products promote neutrophil recruitment independently of bg - dectin - 1 interactions , in contrast with bg - enriched sc cw extracts which poorly induce neutrophil recruitment via dectin - 1 .
sc bg - enriched compounds strongly stimulate ros production via cr3 but not dectin - 1 we next investigate the capacity of bg extracts to modulate phagocytosis and killing , notably by producing ros .
strikingly , ros production within the first 30 min post - stimulation was significantly higher in wt bmdm treated with bg65 and bg75 than in those treated with crude bg15 and zymosan ( fig 7d ) .
conversely , curdlan and wgpd prompted macrophages to release very low amounts of ros , similar to the levels detected in mock conditions .
to determine whether the response to sc bg compounds is mediated by the dectin - 1 or the cr3 pathways , we performed the same experiments in clec7a - / - bmdm and with a neutralizing antibody against cr3 ( alphacd11b ) .
surprisingly , ros production was similar in clec7a - / - and wt bmdm treated with bg65 and tended to be higher (+ 30 %) in response to bg75 in clec7a - / - than in wt bmdm ( fig 7e ) .
in contrast , ros production in response to bg15 was consistently 40 % lower in clec7a - / - than in wt bmdm and was 64 % lower in zymosan - treated clec7a - / - bmdm than their zymosan - treated wt counterparts .
other bg - containing compounds such as curdlan and wgpd induced ros production neither in wt nor clec7a - / - cells ( data in s4b fig ) .
inhibition of the cr3 pathway in bmdm with the blocking monoclonal antibody ( clone m1 / 5 ) led to a moderate to severe impairment of ros production in cells treated with bg - containing sc cw extracts ( fig 7e ) .
cr3 blockade impaired zymosan - stimulated and bg15 - stimulated ros production by 52 % and about 40 % , respectively .
interestingly , blocking the cr3 pathway in bg65 - and bg75 - stimulated bmdm moderately inhibited ros production ( by approximatively 30 %) .
thus , the bg - enriched sc cw extracts bg65 and bg75 strongly stimulate ros production partly through the cr3 but independently of the dectin - 1 pathway .
conversely , crude sc cw extracts stimulate low but dectin - 1 - and cr3 - dependent ros production , despite their tlr2 / 4 activity .
to confirm these results , we analyzed the ability of bmdm pretreated with sc bg compounds to phagocyte and kill bacteria .
incubation with bg - enriched or crude sc cw extracts did not appear to influence the ability of bmdm to phagocyte the s. aureus hg001 strain bacteria ( data in s4c fig ) .
however , even if no statistical differences were evidenced , macrophages incubated with bg65 or bg75 tended to kill more bacteria than those incubated with bg15 or mock .
thus , these findings , and those of our ros experiments , suggest that sc cw extracts enriched in bg stimulate the bactericidal activity of macrophages .
discussion in this study , we show that bg are not sufficient by themselves to trigger cytokine and chemokine production in various types of murine macrophages , despite promoting other activities such as ros production and bacterial killing .
our results suggest that dectin - 1 alone is not sufficient to trigger nfkappab / ap - 1 signaling in macrophages but crosstalk between dectin - 1 and other prrs , such as tlr2 and tlr4 , greatly enhances nfkappab - associated cytokine production , notably when tlr signals are weak .
bg make up around 50 % of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cw [ 16 ] , and as shown here , sc cw extracts contains a mixture of various ligands that activate other prrs on immune cells .
upon enrichment , these prr signals are partially or totally removed , leaving dectin - 1 ligands more less intact .
many studies have described the immuno - modulatory effects of ' beta - glucans ' .
however , contradictory data resulting from these studies may lead to misconceptions about biological activities of bg. these discrepancies may be explained by the heterogeneity of bg preparations , especially regarding source , degree of purity and molecular structure .
for example , even the exact composition of ' zymosan ' remains unclear because zymosan may differ from a provider to another , is rarely handled as supplied and may have undergone treatment before use , such as depleted zymosan that is used as a selective ligand of dectin - 1 .
consequently , several properties have been unfairly ascribed to bg , which prompted us to use a triad of sc cw extracts increasingly enriched in bg. in our study , the incubation of macrophages with extracts from the same strain , substantially altered cell activation depending on the bg content .
our cell reporter assays showed that bg65 and bg75 lowly activate macrophages , notably for cytokine production , and are deprived of myd88 - related activity , despite strong dectin - 1 activity .
consistently , we also showed that activation of dectin - 1 poorly stimulated nfkappab - associated tnfalpha production .
furthermore , sc cw extracts enriched in bg , especially bg75 , induced the production of small but similar amounts of tnfalpha in wt and myd88 - / - cells .
these results seem to contrast with those of previous studies involving particulate bg , but are consistent with those showing that soluble bg has no effect on macrophages and dendritic cells [ 2 ] .
indeed , particulate bg - containing extracts , including curdlan and other sc - or candida albicans cw extracts , and even a synthetic ' bg ' [ 27 ] , has been shown to stimulate cells via the nfkappab pathway , resulting in the production of large amounts of tnfalpha , il - 12 , - 6 , - 10 , ccl2 , and mip - 2 via a dectin - 1 - dependent pathway [ 11,13,18,28,29 ] .
in vivo studies also suggest that bg initiate the mobilization of immune cells ( neutrophils ) to the blood and other organs , like the spleen , by strongly promoting the release of cytokines and chemokines [ 30 ] .
in the context of wound healing , sc bg also activate nfkappab via tlr2 and dectin - 1 in murine and human macrophages in vitro and in vivo , and recruit macrophages to the site of healing [ 31 ] .
thus , particulate bg - containing sc cw extracts are generally thought to promote strong cellular responses .
however , some studies report conflicting findings .
for example , shah et al found that sc bg does not upregulate cytokine production ( il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 6 , il - 10 , tnfalpha ) in microglia cells [ 32 ] , which is consistent with the results of our study. of note , rna values were in lines with cytokine production for all cytokines , although slight unmeaning variation can be observed for tnfalpha in bg15 condition between wt and clec7a - / - bmdm , that could result from post - transcriptional regulation in wt cells , a mechanism previously described by several authors for this cytokine [ 33 ] .
our data were also in lines with results previously observed using depleted zymosan , showing weak il - 10 production and il12p40 induction compared to zymosan [ 19,34 ] .
this seems to suggest that bg - enriched extracts could be alike to depleted zymosan , a hot alkali - treated zymosan that activates dectin - 1 but not tlr2 .
furthermore , particulate bg products have often been poorly characterized ( in terms of structure , composition and source ) , which complicate the comparison of the results .
indeed , adams et al found that the interaction of bg with dectin - 1 strongly depends on the primary structure of bg , including its chain length and side - chain branching [ 7 ] , such that structurally different bg may have distinct biological effects on immune cells .
furthermore , activation of dectin - 1 has been shown to require the formation of a ' phagocytic synapse ' on the cell membrane [ 17 ] .
in addition to contain observable particles under microscope , all bg suspensions used in this study ( except the soluble wgps ) , induced a substantial response in our dectin - 1 reporter assay , even stronger than the positive control wgpd .
consistently with findings of goodridge et al , this strongly suggests that our particulate bg extracts were able to trigger dectin - 1 clustering .
interestingly , some authors reported that bmdm from c57bl / 6 poorly express dectin - 1 and this was the cause of their low responsiveness following highly - enriched bg stimulation as comparison to peritoneal cells or bone marrow - derived dendritic cells .
it might be true that according to the method of in vitro maturation , bmdm could express significantly different levels of the main bg receptor [ 35 ] .
indeed , gersuk et al reported that cells incubated in l929 medium , that we used in this study , exhibit increased expression of surface dectin - 1 compared to cells matured in recombinant m - csf .
moreover , expression of dectin - 1 on bmdm surface was observed by other authors [ 12,18 ] .
furthermore , we also assessed that bmdm , rpm , tepm and the raw - blue ( tm ) cells expressed similar levels of this receptor , meaning that there is no direct correlation between dectin - 1 surface expression levels and the ability of macrophages to respond to enriched - bg. this was clearly elucidated by the lower amounts of tnfalpha production in tepm stimulated by bg65 and bg75 compared to bg15 and zymosan , but also in raw cells which express high endogenous levels of dectin - 1 and exhibit low nfkappab activity after bg - enriched treatment .
tepm isolated from dba / 2 also released low tnfalpha in response to bg65 and bg75 ( data not shown ) , even if that mouse strain express a more active isoform of dectin - 1 compared to c57bl / 6 strain [ 24,25 ] .
thus , we demonstrated that macrophages from various sources were unable to produce a robust inflammatory response following dectin - 1 signaling mediated by bg - enriched treatment .
this is in contradiction with the conclusion of goodridge et al saying that responsiveness of bmdm from c57bl / 6 following bg binding was due to expression of additional factor which restrict dectin - 1 / card9 signaling for tnfalpha induction [ 18 ] .
this is not taking into account the fact that bmdm are globally low responsive cells compared to resting or elicited peritoneal macrophages .
we also observed that in macrophages treated with sc cw extracts enriched in bg , gm - csf was not secreted at an early stage of the response .
instead , the expression of csf2 ( which encodes gm - csf ) was upregulated from a late time - point according to the bg - content of extracts in wt cells that was totally abrogated in their clec7a - / - counterparts .
it has been reported that the production of gm - csf upon stimulation with bg - enriched sc cw extracts also promotes dectin - 1 expression at the surface of activated cells [ 18,36,37,38 ] .
although we observed a slight overexpression of dectin - 1 induced by bg - enriched compounds ( data not shown ) , the secretion of gm - csf was a late consequence of dectin - 1 triggering , suggesting that bg stimulate the expression of csf2 indirectly , by a secondary mechanism , possibly a feedback loop that remains to be deciphered .
the non - pathogenic yeast cw contains mannans , chitins and glycoproteins , as is the case for zymosan [ 14 ] and bg15 .
therefore , it is important to consider the role of these molecules in the cellular responses as they can interact with other prrs or even collaborate with dectin - 1 [ 39,40 ] .
for example , according to their structure , mannans are recognized by mr ( mannose receptor ) , dectin - 2 or even tlr4 , resulting in cytokine production [ 6,41 ] .
this may explain why the activity bg65 was slightly higher than that of bg75 , as bg65 contains almost 4 % of mannans in contrast to bg75 which mannan - content remains less than 1 % .
this is especially true for bg15 or zymosan that induced the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines ( tnfalpha , il - 6 , il - 1beta , ccl2 ) but also the anti - inflammatory cytokine , il - 10 .
furthermore , crude or poorly enriched sc cw extracts have strong tlr2 and in a much lesser extent tlr4 activity , although their ability to activate dectin - 1 resembles that of bg - enriched sc cw extracts , indicating that the inflammatory response elicited by these crude compounds is not mediated by dectin - 1 alone .
gantner et al [ 19 ] and several other studies have reported that zymosan activates macrophages [ 10,32,37,42,43 ] .
this activity has been attributed to bg but it probably results from other cell wall components , as suggested by our experiments and also depleted zymosan versus zymosan comparisons in the literature , or from cooperative or synergistic signals .
indeed , dectin - 1 and tlr2 work together to control the cellular response to microbes [ 29,44 ] .
both dectin - 1 and tlr stimulate the production of tnfalpha and il - 12 via nfkappab in response to particulate stimuli containing zymosan , suggesting that dectin - 1 is an important partner of tlr2 on macrophages .
furthermore , bmdm or bmdc from myd88 - or tlr2 - / - mice produce almost no tnfalpha , il - 6 , - 10 and - 23 in response to zymosan [ 10,45,46 ] , suggesting that tlr pathways are required to trigger the pro - inflammatory response to crude sc cw bg - containing extracts like zymosan .
we also found that myd88 - deficiency strongly affected the ability of zymosan and bg15 to induce the production of tnfalpha .
however , some authors conclude that dectin - 1 is required to elicit an inflammatory response upon zymosan stimulation .
indeed , the overexpression of dectin - 1 in raw264.7 cells enhances tnfalpha and il12p40 secretion in response to zymosan [ 10,19 ] , and taylor et al showed that dectin - 1 - deficient cells fail to release tnfalpha following stimulation with opsonized or unopsonized zymosan [ 11 ] .
in our study , we were unable to make similar conclusions regarding the response of clec7a - / - bmdm to zymosan , although we observed a slightly altered production of tnfalpha by clec7a - / - tepm receiving zymosan .
furthermore , we found that dectin - 1 deficiency did not affect the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines / chemokines in response to zymosan in bmdm , except for that of gm - csf , il - 10 and il - 1beta , an inflammasome - related cytokine which secretion was reported to be mediated through dectin - 1 - dependent pathway in human macrophages [ 47,48 ] .
it is not surprising that il - 10 production induced by zymosan was severely impaired in clec7a - / - bmdm , as far as elcombe et al previously described the erk - and p38 mapk - creb pathways involvement leading to il - 10 release after dectin - 1 engagement [ 34 ] .
our observations are also consistent with the results of shah et al who reported the same effect after neutralizing dectin - 1 on microglia cells [ 32 ] .
we also evidenced that zymosan induced tlr4 activity in a reporter cell line , which may explain why zymosan strongly activated macrophages .
the effects of bg - containing sc cw extracts on tlr4 activity have been rarely investigated or verified upon treatment .
however , a few studies report that tlr4 contributes somewhat to the effects of dectin - 1 on immune cells [ 6,29,42,43 ] .
chemokine production induced by zymosan or zymosan - like extracts induces the recruitment of cells , such as monocytes via ccl2 and also neutrophils mainly via cxcl1 ( kc ) and cxcl2 ( mip2 ) .
our findings suggest that these events occur in a dectin - 1 - independent - manner .
furthermore , the macrophage inflammatory protein mip2 is produced in large amounts by raw264.7 macrophages and dendritic cells stimulated with curdlan [ 36,49 ] .
surprisingly , for all bg - containing sc cw extracts tested , supernatant derived from dba / 2 cells was more chemotactic than that derived from c57bl / 6 cells , in accordance with the fact that the full length form of dectin - 1 is more effective than the truncated form .
ros production was significantly higher in bmdm treated with bg65 and bg75 than those treated with crude sc cw extracts .
ros production was not affected by the loss of clec7a , suggesting that ros production depends on bg but is not mediated by dectin - 1 .
however , poorly enriched compounds such as bg15 and zymosan stimulate the production of low amounts of ros production in part via dectin - 1 .
these findings contrast with previous studies , showing that zymosan induces strong respiratory burst in human and murine macrophages [ 17,19,50,51 ] , consistent with our findings , some studies showed that macrophages produce only low amounts of ros in response to zymosan [ 11 ] and respiratory burst induced by zymosan is severely impaired following the genetic deletion of dectin - 1 [ 11,50,51 ] .
furthermore , ros promote the induction of il - 10 in human macrophages treated with zymosan [ 52 ] .
we also observed that zymosan and bg15 stimulate il - 10 expression by bmdm in a dectin - 1 - dependent manner ( confirmed at protein levels ) , which is consistent with the findings of elcombe et al [ 34 ] .
conversely , bg - enriched sc cw extracts triggered the production of significant amounts of ros but negligible amounts of il - 10 mrna and protein , both in wt and clec7a - / - bmdm .
this suggests that ros production depends on bg but not dectin - 1 , and raises doubt about the link between il - 10 and ros production .
instead , neutralization of cd11b ( cr3 ) impaired ros production by at least 30 % in macrophages incubated with bg - enriched sc cw compounds , and to an even greater extent in those incubated with crude sc cw compounds .
thus , cr3 partially initiates respiratory burst following the recognition of unopsonized bg compounds .
these findings are consistent with several studies demonstrating that cr3 is involved in recognition and phagocytosis of nonopsonized zymosan , leading to superoxide production [ 53 ] .
furthermore , cr3 appears to be the most important receptor for phagocytosis , although dectin - 1 is necessary for the optimal uptake of bg [ 54 ] .
this may explain why we observed that ros production was similar between wt and clec7a - / - bmdm treated with bg - enriched sc cw extracts .
however , we found that the inhibition of cr3 was not able to impair ros production to levels observed with crude sc cw compounds .
this suggests that other ( s ) receptor ( s ) is involved in respiratory burst such as the tlr / myd88 pathway , although gantner et al demonstrated that this pathway is not linked to ros production [ 19 ] .
the phagocytic and bactericidal activity of bmdm treated sc cw compounds were consistent with the amount of ros that they produced .
consequently , bg are of great interest not only for anti - fungal , but also for anti - bacterial immunity .
indeed , clec7a - deficient hosts are more susceptible to c. albicans infections than their wt counterparts [ 11 ] .
this is consistent with the fact that bg from the pathogenic yeast candida albicans are shielded from dectin - 1 by outer cell wall components , allowing the pathogen to evade host immune responses [ 6,28,55,56 ] .
conclusion in conclusion , our findings demonstrate that the recognition of sc cw bg - enriched extracts by macrophages relies on c - type lectins receptors among which dectin - 1 appears central .
however , in absence of a concomitant tlr stimulation , the triggering of dectin - 1 pathway results in a weak nfkappab response and consequently the production of low amounts of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines .
conversely , these bg - enriched extracts are able to activate macrophages for strong respiratory burst .
despite the intense research led in this field , the events that occur following the recognition of sc bg compounds by dectin - 1 and other prrs remain unclear , probably because the compounds used until now have been too poorly characterized .
considering our findings , highly bg - enriched sc cw extracts may be useful in the future to determine the mechanism of action of bg to evaluate their utility as immuno - modulatory molecules .

time - space synaesthetes " see " time units organized in a spatial form .
while the structure might be invariant for most synaesthetes , the perspective by which some view their calendar is somewhat flexible .
one well - studied synaesthete l adopts different viewpoints for months seen vs. heard .
interestingly , l claims to prefer her auditory perspective , even though the month names are represented visually upside down .
to verify this , we used a spatial - cueing task that included audiovisual month cues .
these cues were either congruent with l 's preferred " auditory " viewpoint ( auditory - only and auditory + month inverted ) or incongruent ( upright visual - only and auditory + month upright ) .
our prediction was that l would show enhanced cueing effects ( larger response time difference between valid and invalid targets ) following the audiovisual congruent cues since both elicit the " preferred " auditory perspective .
also , when faced with conflicting cues , we predicted l would choose the preferred auditory perspective over the visual perspective .
as we expected , l did show enhanced cueing effects following the audiovisual congruent cues that corresponded with her preferred auditory perspective , but that the visual perspective dominated when l was faced with both viewpoints simultaneously .
the results are discussed with relation to the reification hypothesis of sequence space synaesthesia ( eagleman , 2009 ) .
synaesthesia spatial - cueing spatial perception attention mental vantage points orienting reification introduction synaesthesia is a fascinating phenomenon whereby ordinary sensory information perceived in one modality elicits a second extraordinary sensory experience in the same or different modality .
the types of associations most studied include experiencing colors for letters and numbers ( e.g. , dixon et al. , 2000 ) , specific tastes for words ( e.g. , simner and ward , 2006 ) , and colors evoked by different musical tones ( e.g. , cytowic and eagleman , 2009 ) .
here we examined an individual ( l ) who sees time in space , meaning that years , months , days , and hours elicit highly specific spatial locations that surround her .
this type of association is encased under the larger umbrella term of sequence - space synaesthesia ( sss ; eagleman , 2009 ) .
an intriguing theory of sss is that the spatial forms are the objectification of overlearned sequences ( the reification hypothesis ; eagleman , 2009 ) .
in other words , the spatial forms that synaesthetes report may be closer to the experience of real " objects " than mere figments of visualization / imagination .
in fact , synaesthetic reports of sequences having fixed , object - centered coordinates speaks to that very possibility ( smilek et al. , 2007 ; eagleman , 2009 ) .
as l once described , " when i hear the month january it sits to my right , but then if i see the word january it is all of a sudden now to my left .
even within my spatial maps , i can choose to take on a variety of perspectives by zooming in and out voluntarily. " being able to move about in one 's spatial representation suggests that the spatial forms are not necessarily tied to the synaesthete 's body ( ego - centric ) , but rather encompass a coordinate system similar to that of objects ( object - centered ; eagleman , 2009 ) .
if the ability to change perspectives is a consistent quality of sss , then it must be incorporated in current theories .
to date this characteristic has been described as a mere curiosity ( eagleman , 2009 ) .
numerous subjective reports from sequence - space synaesthetes have suggested that their fixed spatial representations can be viewpoint variant ( galton , 1880 ; seron et al. , 1992 ; cytowic and eagleman , 2009 ) .
one of the challenges to objectively verifying these subjective claims has been in designing a reliable experimental paradigm to measure the changes in viewpoint .
the majority of month - space synaesthetes that we have interviewed report altering their vantage point as the months progress over time or take on the viewpoint of the month cued .
if cued with the month april , for example , the vantage point could change for some synaesthetes and appear as if they were all of a sudden standing in front of april .
these constant and fleeting changes in viewpoint make it very difficult , not only to document consistency of their month - space , but to capture a reliable change in perspective .
for instance synaesthete h reported , " as i moved through the year , i am very aware of my place in the oval at the current time , and the direction i am moving in " ( mann et al. , 2009 ) .
synaesthete l , on the other hand , has two perspectives from which she views her month - space , triggered involuntarily by whether she hears or sees the month in question ( jarick et al. , 2009a , 2011a ) .
in other words , l 's perspectives are not dependent on the current month , cued month , or current season .
we can reliably trigger changes in l 's vantage points by modifying the sensory presentation of the cued stimulus .
empirical confirmation of l 's ability to change perspectives has already been established in a previous study ( jarick et al. , 2009a ) , where we have demonstrated opposite response patterns to months and hours depending on the modality of the inducing cue used in a spatial cueing paradigm .
for instance , if the word january was presented as a central cue , l responded faster to detect targets on the left because that it was congruent with where january was spatially located ( according to her visual spatial map ) .
however , if l was then presented with a voice saying january out loud , she was faster to detect a target on the ( opposite ) right side because it was now congruent with where january was spatially located ( according to her auditory spatial map ) .
this three - way interaction between cue modality ( auditory vs. visual ) , cue type ( early vs. late ) , and target location ( left vs. right ) was not found for the non - synaesthetes tested .
thus , l 's subjective report of being able to change perspectives depending on the modality of the cue was objectively confirmed .
in hindsight , these results provided one leg of support for the reification hypothesis in the sense that the month - space is not necessarily tied to the synaesthete ( egocentric ) , but can exists with respect to object - centered coordinates ( taking on object - like properties ) .
as we discovered a year or so later , the uniqueness of l 's synaesthesia was not limited to her ability to view her time - space from opposite vantage points .
l also claimed to prefer to view her space from her auditory viewpoint .
as shown in figure 1 , viewing written words from this vantage point causes the words to appear upside - down - - a viewpoint for which she would seldom see in real life. by preference , we mean that l views her time - space from the auditory perspective most often and feels most comfortable doing so. just as one might have a default point of view when we imagine a car ( a 3d object that conforms to object - based coordinates ) , l reports to have a " default " viewpoint of her month - space .
as if the month names and month spaces encompass objects - based coordinates themselves .
according to the reification hypothesis , this would be the case if synaesthetes were treating the months as " objects " and not just a location in space .
figure 1 a schematic depicting the 3d spatial arrangement of l 's spatial calendar .
the month cues used in the current experiment were january , february , march ( early months ) , and may , june , july ( late months ) .
the top signifies the mental vantage point ( mvp ) she takes when the month name is heard ( i.e. , auditory cue ) while the bottom indicates the mvp she takes when the month name is seen ( i.e. , visual cue ) .
in order to test the idea that spatial synaesthetes could have a preferred or " default " mental vantage point for viewing spatial - forms , we focused on the synaesthete l 's representation of her months .
l has participated in previous studies over the years aimed at verifying her time - spaces ( months and hours ; jarick et al. , 2009a , 2011a ) , as well as her number - space ( jarick et al. , 2009b , 2011b ) .
as such , the consistency of l 's spatial - maps have all been well - established and we have empirically demonstrated that l views her month - space from different perspectives depending on whether the month is seen vs. heard ( jarick et al. , 2009a ) .
in fact , l takes the exact opposite vantage point , making designing an experiment fairly simple .
for instance , when l sees a month name written , she views her space organized such that january , february , and march are on her left side and may , june , and july on her right ( the rest of the months flow behind her , as seen in figure 1 ) .
when she hears the name of a month spoken , however , she takes the opposite viewpoint and january , february , and march are now on her right side and may , june , and july on her left ( the other months extend outward into space ) .
consistent with the objectification of overlearned sequences ( eagleman , 2009 ) , l reports that she views her month - space from the auditory perspective it is as if she were looking at her months ( and month names ) literally upside down .
what is even more striking about this unusual perspective , is that l claims to prefer it that way .
experiment 1 to first verify l 's claim that her auditory perspective was akin to viewing her months upside down , we tested whether we could elicit her " auditory " vantage point with the visual month names alone ( i.e. , month names written upside down ) .
we used a spatial - cueing task ( posner , 1981 ) containing two cueing conditions : month names upright or month names inverted .
our predictions were straightforward : we expected that the upright month cues would trigger l 's visual perspective and as such , early month cues ( jan. , feb. , march ) should orient her attention to the left side of space ( faster to detect left targets ) , while later month cues ( may , june , july ) should orient her attention to the right ( faster to detect right targets ) .
our key prediction to verify l 's claim of viewing months upside down , however , was that the inverted month names should trigger the reverse " auditory " perspective .
thus , inverted early months ( jan. , feb. , march ) should orient her attention to the right side of space ( faster to detect right targets ) , while inverted later months ( may , june , july ) should orient her attention to the left ( faster to detect left targets ) , essentially reversing the cueing pattern seen for the upright month cues .
if our predictions are confirmed , we should find the same three - way interaction that we previously found ( jarick et al. , 2009a,b ) between cue condition ( upright vs. inverted ) , cue type ( early vs. late ) , and target location ( left vs. right ) for l that is absent in non - synaesthetic controls .
methods participants we tested a 23 - year - old time - space synaesthete l and five non - synaesthetic controls from willamette university , all of which received for a honorarium for their time .
all participants had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and hearing and were right - handed .
participants gave informed consent before participating and the board of research ethics at willamette university and the university of waterloo approved the experimental procedures .
materials all stimuli were presented on a white background .
visual month cues were black text ( geneva font , 72 pt ) .
the centrally located cues consisted of 6 month names ( height 0.6degrees visual angle and maximally 6.5degrees in length ) - - january , february , march ( early months ) , may june , and july ( late months ) .
targets were black squares ( each side subtending 0.6degrees of visual angle ) and placed at an eccentricity of 10.5degrees from the center of fixation .
stimuli presentation and data collection were controlled by superlab 4.0 experimental software .
procedure participants were seated ~ 57 cm in front of a computer screen and asked to perform a spatial cueing task .
a typical trial involved a fixation cross for 600 ms , a central cue ( month name ) appearing either upright or inverted for 600 ms , followed immediately by a target square to either the left or right of the month cue .
the target remained on the screen until the participant responded or 3500 ms elapsed .
the task for l and a group of five non - synaesthetic controls was to detect this target as quickly as possible by pressing a central button on a response pad with their dominant ( right ) hand .
once a response was given , the next trial began .
on about 10 % of the trials no target would appear (" catch trials ") , for which participants were advised to withhold their response until the next trial .
these trials were inserted to make certain participants were staying on task .
there were four blocks of 132 trials ( 60 valid , 60 invalid , 12 catch ) , for a total of 528 trials .
inverted and upright month cues were randomly intermixed within the blocks .
participants had self - paced breaks between blocks .
it is important to note that although the month names served as spatial cues for l , she was aware that they were not predictive of the target location - - targets appeared to both the right and left 50 % of the time ( i.e. , half valid , half invalid ) .
thus , there was no incentive to even pay attention to the month names while detecting the targets presented .
results and discussion the synaesthete l and non - synaesthetic controls performed perfectly on catch trials ( 100 % accurate ) .
the response times for l and the controls were submitted to a recursive outlier procedure , for which observations greater or less than 2.5 standard deviations were discarded .
as a result , only 0.65 % of data was removed from l , and an average of 1 % from controls .
an analysis of variance ( anova ) with l 's response times showed a significant cue condition ( upright vs. inverted ) x cue type ( early vs. late ) x target location ( left vs. right ) interaction , f ( 1 , 35 ) = 1178.68 , p < 0.0001 , as depicted in figure 2. that is , when the cue was an upright month name , it elicited l 's visual vantage point .
as such , she detected targets on the left side faster following early months and detected targets on the right side faster following late months .
however , the opposite response pattern resulted when the cues were inverted month names , as they elicited l 's " auditory " viewpoint .
thus , following inverted cues , l detected targets on the right faster following early months and faster to detected targets on the left following late months .
this three - way interaction suggests that when cued by an early month ( for example ) , l responded significantly faster to targets on the left when the cue was upright , but detected targets on the right when the cue was inverted .
as predicted , these results demonstrate a clear reversal in viewpoint triggered by the two types of visual cues , with the upright cues eliciting the visual vantage point and the inverted cues eliciting the " auditory " vantage point .
as expected , not one of the five non - synaesthetic controls showed this three - way interaction ( all p 's > 0.303 ) .
thus , our findings show that upright and inverted month names cued opposing viewpoints for l , but not for the non - synaesthetic controls .
in essence , our data objectively verified l 's subjective claim that her " auditory " mental vantage point causes her to view her months upside down .
this finding suggests that l 's vantage point is not solely dictated by the modality of the inducing stimulus ( i.e. , a month spoken aloud ) like previously believed ( jarick et al. , 2009a,b ) , but rather can be induced by visual stimuli alone as long as the orientation of the stimulus is consistent with l 's vantage point of her month - space .

** p < 0.05 .
experiment 2 next we tested l 's second claim that she prefers to view her months from the auditory perspective ( i.e. , visually upside down ) .
to reiterate , by preference we mean a " default " point of view for which l might show a bias in her behavior toward .
to test this , we attempted to create a situation where her visual and auditory viewpoints would be in conflict in order to observe which one she is more biased toward using .
if her auditory perspective is indeed her " default " viewpoint , then that perspective should be the viewpoint she takes .
using the same spatial - cueing task , we included four types of cue conditions : auditory - only month names , visual - only month names ( upright ) , audiovisual congruent month names ( visual inverted + auditory ) , and audiovisual incongruent month names ( visual upright + auditory ) .
our predictions were as follows : audiovisual congruent cues should not only trigger l 's " auditory " perspective , but should facilitate detection of valid targets ( due to the multisensory enhancement of having bimodal cues triggering the same perspective ) .
therefore , the audiovisual congruent cues should produce the largest cueing effects ( i.e. , difference in response time between valid and invalid targets ) compared to auditory - only cues .
our key prediction , however , was regarding the audiovisual incongruent condition .
we hypothesized that when the month cues trigger both perspectives simultaneously ( i.e. , auditory cue triggers " auditory " perspective and visual upright cue triggers visual perspective ) , the preferred " auditory " perspective should be the one elicited. that is , if l prefers her auditory viewpoint , then she should show a bias in her response pattern consistent with the " auditory " perspective ( i.e. , similar to the auditory - only condition ) .
methods participants the time - space synaesthete l participated for a honorarium .
we did not include non - synaesthetic control participants , as this examination was purely a test of l 's ability .
materials and procedure stimuli were the same as experiment 1 , except the two audiovisual ( av ) conditions were added .
the av congruent condition elicited the same vantage point for l and consisted of the visual month name inverted paired simultaneously with the month spoken aloud from the computer loudspeakers ( both cues triggered the " auditory " perspective ) .
both visual and auditory stimuli were similar in the degree of saliency to the participant , in that the month name appeared on the computer screen at a comfortable reading size ( height of 0.6degrees visual angle and maximally 6.5degrees in length ) and the voice was presented at a comfortable hearing level (~ 65 db ) .
the av incongruent condition should elicit conflicting vantage points for l and consisted of the visual month name upright paired simultaneously with the month spoken aloud from the computer loudspeakers ( visual cue triggered visual perspective while auditory cue triggered " auditory " perspective ) .
stimuli were presented in two blocks , each containing 30 valid and 30 invalid of each type of cue ( visual - only , auditory - only , av congruent , av incongruent ) plus 12 catch trials , all randomly intermixed .
participants l had a 5 - min break between blocks .
there were 528 trials in total and the experimental session lasted about 20 min .
results and discussion l performed perfectly on catch trials ( 100 % accurate ) .
only 0.01 % of l 's data was removed by the outlier procedure (+/ - 2.5 standard deviations ) .
to evaluate which viewpoint each cue condition would elicit ( i.e. , whether l 's response pattern would be biased toward her " auditory " or visual perspective ) , we conducted a 4 x 2 x 2 repeated measured anova with the factors cue condition ( auditory - only , visual - only , av incongruent , and av congruent ) , cue type ( early and late ) , and target location ( left and right ) .
the anova revealed a significant main effect of cue condition , f ( 2.28 , 72 ) = 30.97 , p < 0.001 , and a significant two - way interaction between cue type and target , f ( 1 , 24 ) = 6.27 , p < 0.05 .
the key finding was the significant three - way interaction between cue condition , cue type , and target location , f ( 3 , 72 ) = 46.36 , p < 0.001 , which suggested that the different cue conditions were eliciting different vantage points for l. the results can be seen in figure 3 .
figure 3 l 's target detection times for the four cue conditions in experiment 2 .
early month cues consisted of the months january , february , march , while late month cues were the months may , june , july .
the visual - only condition contained visual month cues that were upright .
the auditory - only contained auditory month cues that were spoken aloud over loudspeakers .
the audiovisual incongruent cues contained auditory month names paired with the visual month name upright ( triggering conflicting viewpoints ) , while the audiovisual congruent contained auditory month names paired with the visual month name inverted ( triggering the same viewpoint ) .
error bars represent the 95 % confidence intervals .
** p < 0.05 .
to investigate this three - way interaction further , we conducted a 2 ( cue condition ) x 2 ( cue type ) x 2 ( target location ) anova for each unimodal ( auditory - only vs. visual - only ) and bimodal ( av congruent vs. av incongruent ) conditions separately .
the unimodal conditions have been tested previously ( jarick et al. , 2009a ) , for which a significant three - way interaction was found that depicted the vantage point reversal between visual and auditory cues .
in other words , the auditory cues elicited the " auditory " viewpoint and the visual cues elicited the opposing visual viewpoint .
based on our previous findings , we predict the same three - way interaction for the unimodal conditions here .
not surprisingly , our prediction was confirmed and the anova revealed a significant three - way interaction between cue condition , cue type , and target location , f ( 1 , 27 ) = 34.93 , p < 0.001 , again replicating the opposing viewpoints triggered by the visual - only and auditory - only cues .
the anova also showed significant main effects of cue condition , f ( 1 , 27 ) = 19.93 , p < 0.001 , and cue type , f ( 1 , 27 ) = 4.71 , p < 0.05 , as well as a significant two - way interaction between cue condition and target , f ( 1 , 27 ) = 6.24 , p < 0.05 .
no other comparisons were significant .
therefore , consistent with previous findings ( jarick et al. , 2009a,b ) , l responded in a manner consistent with her visual perspective when cued by the visual - only upright months , as well as the " auditory " perspective when cued by the auditory - only months .
the more interesting finding is whether l showed a bias toward her preferred " auditory " viewpoint .
this was tested in the av incongruent condition , where the cues triggered conflicting vantage points .
thus , our predictions for the bimodal conditions really depend on which vantage points l is biased toward in the av incongruent cue condition .
we predicted that the av congruent cues ( auditory + month inverted ) would undoubtedly trigger l 's " auditory " vantage point , since we have already shown that each does individually from the unimodal analysis .
the av incongruent cues ( auditory + month upright ) , on the other hand , were expected to trigger both visual and " auditory " perspectives , thereby putting l in conflict .
due to l 's declared preference for her auditory perspective , we predicted that the " auditory " viewpoint would be more strongly elicited .
if this is the case , we should not find a significant three - way interaction due to both cue conditions showing similar cueing patterns , but rather a two - way interaction between cue type and target location .
contrary to our predictions , the anova did reveal a significant three - way interaction between cue condition , cue type , and target location , f ( 1 , 26 ) = 155.27 , p < 0.001 , which indicated that the av incongruent cues elicited l 's visual vantage point .
visual inspection of figure 3 illustrates the perspective reversal ( i.e. , three - way interaction ) , such that the av incongruent cues ( i.e. , when the cues were in conflict ) elicited the same mental vantage point as the visual - only cues , while the av congruent cues ( when the cues were complementary ) elicited the same mental vantage point as the auditory - only cues .
at first glance , this latter finding seems to falsify l 's claim of preferring the " auditory " viewpoint , since when pitted against one another , the visual viewpoint was the one that biased l 's attention .
however , there are other possibilities to consider .
perhaps when the cues triggered opposite vantage points , l needed to reconcile the conflict with a strategy .
intuitively speaking , the simplest strategy in this case would be to actively ignore one of the cues and in this situation ( i.e. , being visual detection task ) the auditory cue is easiest to suppress .
in other words , it would be more difficult to suppress visual information and simultaneously perform a visual task .
it would therefore be easiest for l to suppress the auditory information and focus on the visual , which would result in response times consistent with her visual perspective .
another possibility is that even though l has a claimed preference for the " auditory " perspective this does not mean that the auditory perspective will be dominant .
it is well - known that vision is the dominant sense , and it would not be too far fetched to believe that the visual cues would be dominant in determining l 's vantage points .
there is , however , another avenue to evaluate l 's claim of her preferred " auditory " vantage point - - to analyze the magnitude of the cueing effects ( i.e. , response time difference between valid and invalid targets ) within the cue conditions .
to get a measure of magnitude , we calculated response times to detect valid targets ( target in cued location ) and invalid targets ( target in uncued location ) for each of the cue conditions .
we performed a repeated measures two - way anova with the factors cue condition ( visual - only , auditory - only , av congruent , and av incongruent ) and validity ( valid vs. invalidly cued targets ) .
notably , the " valid " trials in the av incongruent condition were with reference to the vantage point l took that being the visual perspective .
we predicted that due to the multisensory nature of the av conditions , both would show a multisensory benefit with larger cueing effects compared to the visual - only or auditory - only conditions .
in terms of l 's preference for her auditory viewpoint , the av congruent cues should show a significantly stronger cueing effect compared to the other cue conditions .
the anova showed a significant main effect of cue condition , f ( 3 , 177 ) = 38.97 , p < 0.001 , and a main effect of validity , f ( 1 , 59 ) = 104.28 , p < 0.001 .
cue condition and validity was also shown to interact , f ( 3 , 177 ) = 2.58 , p = 0.05 .
to interpret this interaction we calculated cueing magnitude scores ( invalid response times minus valid response times ) .
these cueing magnitude scores are shown in figure 4 .
post - hoc ( lsd ) comparisons indicated that cueing magnitudes were greatest in the av congruent condition than the visual - only ( p < 0.05 ) , auditory - only ( p < 0.05 ) , and av incongruent condition ( p < 0.05 ) .
the visual - only , auditory - only and av incongruent conditions did not differ at all ( all f 's < 1 and p 's > 0.05 ) .
although the audiovisual conditions both showed faster overall response times compared to the unimodal conditions , only the av congruent cues differed in the magnitude of their cueing effects .
specifically , following the av congruent cues ( both elicited auditory vantage point ) , l showed the greatest cost when the target was invalid , but also the greatest benefit when the target was valid .
this finding is consistent with l 's claim of preferring the viewpoint elicited by the av congruent cues ( i.e. , " auditory viewpoint ") .
figure 4 magnitude of l 's cueing effects for each cue condition in experiment 2 .
cueing effects were calculated by subtracting response times to detect valid targets ( target appeared at cued location ) from response times to detect invalid targets ( target appears in uncued location ) .
error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals .
conclusions together our data show that l 's performance in the spatial - cueing task was clearly influenced by her extraordinary month - space associations in which the vantage point from where she views her month - space has a profound influence on her spatial attention .
in the first experiment we were able to capture l 's auditory mental vantage point mvp using visual stimuli alone and in the second experiment show some objective support for her claim that she prefers to view her space from the " auditory " perspective .
thus , far , l is the only synaesthete who has shown these unique traits .
other accounts of time - space synaesthesia have reported being able to " zoom in and out " of their spatial forms or report feeling like they are walking along with the months as they pass through the year ( galton , 1880 ; seron et al. , 1992 ; cytowic and eagleman , 2009 ) , but none who report reversing their perspective with reference to an inducing stimulus .
the finding that l can reverse her perspective on " time " is not new ( jarick et al. , 2009a,b ) , however our finding that she vividly experienced the month names upside down when viewing her month - space from the " auditory " perspective is very informative .
it perhaps suggests that her month - space does not always adhere to egocentric coordinates and could exhibit object - like properties .
the fact that we could induce both of her vantage points using visual stimuli alone speaks to how visually detailed l 's month - space is for her .
just as we can be influenced to view objects from different perspectives , l too can view her spatial calendar from different mental vantage points .
her report of having a preferred viewpoint is also consistent to how we might imagine objects from a canonical perspective .
keeping in mind of course that our mental viewpoints are initially the product of viewing real objects in the external world , while l 's viewpoints are completely internally generated .
this evidence can provide some behavioral support for eagleman 's reification hypothesis. of course this is a first step and only one synaesthete ; more data is needed to generalize these findings to other synaesthetes .
however , if it is the case that these implicit sequences trigger an experience of objecthood for synaesthetes , theories regarding the development and neural architecture of synaesthesia need to take that characteristic into account .
for instance , previous studies ( hubbard et al. , 2005 ; tang et al. , 2008 ) have primarily focused on the parietal lobes to uncover the neural correlates of sss , being that the seeing as though the parietal areas process visuo - spatial information including well - learned sequences .
however , as eagleman ( 2009 ) suggests , perhaps we should also be looking at activity in the temporal lobes where properties of objects are represented .
in fact , pariyadath et al .
( 2008 ) have recently shown brain activation in temporal lobe areas during the processing of overlearned sequences in non - synaesthetes .
temporal lobe activation for sss has yet to be confirmed , however it would provide some clues as to why many sequence - space synaesthetes also see colors for the months of the year and days of the week ( sagiv et al. , 2006 ; smilek et al. , 2007 ) .
what is further unique about l is that she possesses a strong preferred viewpoint that is unconventional to what most people would prefer , what most people would be " taught. " she prefers to view her space upsidedown , where the average person would intuitively feel more comfortable viewing months written upright .
in terms of the developmental debate of synaesthesia , some argue that it is simply the product of learning .
however , if that were the case , it is unclear what might have motivated l to learn a mental calendar that would be upsidedown .

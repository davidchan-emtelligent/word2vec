the impact of human activity on the environment has led to a steady increase of the amounts of copper in the ecosystems .
this element accumulates in plants and water , potentially exposing rodents to its harmful effects .
in industrial districts , a decrease in the density of small rodent populations has been observed .
this decline may be caused by many factors , including mortality , decreased fertility , or impaired sexual behavior .
the decline in the reproductive abilities of small rodents after copper exposure was demonstrated in our previous work ( miska - schramm a , kruczek m , kapusta j , ecotoxicology 23:1546 - 1554 , 2014 ) .
the aim of the presented research was to determine how copper administered at concentrations similar to those recorded in industrial districts ( cu i - 150 mg / kg , cu ii - 600 mg / kg , c - control ) affects the sexual behavior of small rodents .
the model species was the bank vole ( myodes glareolus ) .
the behavior and vocalizations of male - female pairs were recorded during open - field tests : malec vs. femalec ; malecu i vs. femalec ; malecu ii vs. femalec while in preference tests , female behavior was assessed in the following combinations : femalec vs. malec & malecu i ; femalec vs. malec & malecu ii. in the presented work , we show that copper decreased the males' sexual attractiveness .
females showed suppressed preference towards males treated with 600 mg / kg copper .
the number of sniffs and a number of approaches towards cu ii males was significantly lower than towards control individuals .
also , in preference test with 150 mg / kg treated animals , total activity was lower towards copper treated animals .
at the same time , copper did not influence intra - sexual interactions .
keywords copper bank vole sexual behavior preference test issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media , llc , part of springer nature 2018 introduction one of the most serious problems of the rapid industrial development is contamination by physiological substances occurring at excessive levels .
plants growing on contaminated soil may accumulate substantial concentrations of different metals , and then these plants may be ingested by herbivores ( wijnhoven et al. 2007 ) .
for animals living in polluted areas , often the only sources of water are contaminated .
significant concentrations of different metals have been found in the tissues of such animals ( gdula - argasinska et al. 2004 ; martiniakova et al. 2012 ; martiniakova et al. 2011 ; nikolov et al. 2010 ; ullah et al. 2014 ; wijnhoven et al. 2007 ; zounkova et al. 2014 ) .
at the same time , in industrial districts a decline in the density of rodent populations has been widely observed ( kataev et al. 1994 ; sheffield et al. 2001 ) .
there is no overall data available explaining this phenomenon .
one of the reasons may be the altered reproduction of small rodents .
our previous studies have shown that excess of copper , a physiological trace element which , in extreme concentrations , may lead to degenerative changes in an organism ( brewer 2007 ; brewer 2010 ) , negatively influence reproductive abilities of small rodent males mainly by declining their sperm quality and quantity ( miska - schramm et al. 2014 ) .
therefore , it may potentially impact their sexual behavior .
this , in combination with reproductive morphological parameters , influences reproductive success of the population .
the model species in our experiment is the bank vole ( myodes glareolus , schreber 1780 ) .
this animal was selected for several reasons .
the bank vole is thought to be the most common rodent species in europe and asia .
it is a polyphagous species showing high plasticity in dietary requirements and undergoing large changes in diet during the annual cycle ( macdonald 2001 ) .
generally the bank vole feeds mostly on herbs and tree seeds ; it also supplements its diet with invertebrates ( eccard and ylonen 2001 ; eccard and ylonen 2006 ) .
plants growing on polluted sites , and the invertebrates living there , may accumulate increased amounts of copper ( chakroun et al .
2010 ; lukan 2009 ; owojori and siciliano 2012 ; sekara et al .
2005 ) .
organisms inhabiting industrial districts are exposed thorough their diet not only to metal - contaminated plants and invertebrates but also to contaminated water ( youngers et al. 2002 ) .
for many years the bank vole was considered a polygynous species ( gipps 1985 ) , but molecular techniques have revealed that females commonly mate with multiple males ( borkowska and ratkiewicz 2010 ; ratkiewicz and borkowska 2000 ) and therefore should be considered promiscuous .
bank vole communication is based mainly on olfactory and auditory signals .
the olfactory signals are highly volatile substances which can be used for long - distance communication .
in the communication between conspecifics , the olfactory system plays roles in social interaction as well , as in the reproductive activity of bank voles ( marchlewska - koj 2000 ) .
pheromones are excreted mainly in urine and faeces , and are secreted through skin glands ( bind et al. 2013 ; cheung 2008 ; kannan and archunan 2001 ) .
in sexual behavior they play an important role in enabling females to distinguish a potential mating partner , and in identifying social status or kinship ( kruczek 2007 ; kruczek and pochron 1997 ) .
for example , rat females prefer males with stronger testosterone - controlled signals , such as male chemosignals ( xiao et al. 2004 ) .
females show an increase of behavioral activity in response to chemosignals from dominant males ( horne and ylonen 1996 ; kruczek and pochron 1997 ) , which have been shown to have better reproductive morphological parameters than subordinate ones ( kruczek and styrna 2009 ) .
in addition to using olfactory signals , bank voles also communicate by means of calls in two ranges : audible to humans ( below 8 khz ) and high - frequency ( ca. 20 - 35 khz ) ( kapusta et al. 2007 ; marchlewska - koj 2000 ) .
in nonsocial situations , the bank vole uses calls only when trapped or handled ( marchlewska - koj 2000 ) .
in social behavior , the calls are associated with aggressive behavior during intra - male encounters ( kapusta and pochron 2011 ) , sexual behavior in heterosexual interaction ( kapusta and sales 2009 ) and infant - mother communication ( szentgyorgyi et al. 2008 ) .
in male - female encounters , bank vole males emit ultrasounds at 30 - 35 khz , depending on the male 's earlier sexual experience ( kapusta et al. 1994 ; marchlewska - koj 2000 ) .
in the presence of females , sexually experienced males emit more signals than inexperienced ones ( kapusta et al. 1994 ) .
as has been shown in mice , females present a clear preference for vocalizing males over devocalized ones ( asaba et al. 2014 ; hammerschmidt et al. 2009 ) .
moreover , the response of females to male calling is clearly hormone - dependent : ovariectomized house mice show no preference for vocalizing males ( pomerantz et al. 1983 ) .
vocal displays associated with sexual encounters are often mediated by testosterone released from the testes ( bass and remage - healey 2008 ; james et al. 2008 ; pasch et al. 2011 ) .
copper of both natural and anthropogenic origin is present in natural ecosystems ( spatari et al. 2002 ) .
in reproductive biology , copper plays an important role as a component of enzymes with activity often correlated with endocrine function , for example , in the regulation of progesterone production by luteal cells via the involvement of superoxide dismutase ( sales et al .
2011 ) , or regulation of the production of steroid hormone by copper via inhibition of the testicular enzyme 17beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenaze ( chattopadhyay et al. 2005 ) .
molecular research has shown that copper can bind with estrogen receptor - alpha ( er - alpha ) in human breast cancer cell line mcf - 7 ( martin et al. 2003 ) .
this suggests that excess copper might also bind with er - alpha in animal organisms .
in human males , copper has been found to be positively associated with testosterone , and a positive relation between the levels of testosterone and lh has also been described ( meeker et al. 2010 ) .
copper is also associated with a nonmonotonic decrease of thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) , which can have adverse effects on development , behavior , metabolism , reproduction and other functions ( meeker et al. 2009 ) .
ng and liu ( 1990 ) suggested a direct toxic action of copper on steroid - producing cells in the adrenal gland and testes .
according to previous study , in the bank vole , copper inhibited spermatogenic activity , as indicated by a decrease of the spermatogenic index ( miska - schramm et al. 2014 ) .
oral administration of copper lowered bank vole sperm quality and quantity .
this was expressed by higher proportions of sperm cells with abnormal heads , lower proportions of sperm cells with correct structure of the tail cytoplasmic membrane , and also with the lower proportions of viable and mobile sperm cells ( miska - schramm et al. 2014 ). that experiment used two doses of copper : basal ( 150 mg / kg ) and elevated ( 600 mg / kg ) .
both copper doses led to lower epididymal sperm number , but only the higher dose reduced the other sperm cell parameters ; the lower copper dose also increased bank vole testes weight ( miska - schramm et al. 2014 ) .
these findings suggested that the lower dose may have accelerated selected endocrine pathways ( e.g. , er - alpha ) , while the higher dose was toxic to the bank vole males and harmed their reproductive parameters .
the data on the effects of excess copper on rodent females' reproductive abilities is sparse , in contrast to the large amount of research on copper deficiency in this sex ( bureau et al. 2003 ; keen et al. 2003 ) .
as mentioned above , it is thought that copper in females may act through neurohormonal pathways at the level of the hypothalamus ( michaluk and kochman 2007 ) .
in the bank vole , copper did not affect the number of matured ovarian follicles ; a dose of 600 mg / kg reduced female body weight , while 150 mg / kg increased relative uterus weight ( miska - schramm et al. 2014 ) .
in view of these reproduction - related morphological disorders associated with copper , it is reasonable to suggest that copper might also modify rodents' sexual behavior .
to our knowledge , only two studies have been done to test this conjecture in vertebrates : in rats , ingesting copper - enriched food led to decreased aggression levels against same - sex individuals , and it suppressed male sexual behavior in the presence of rat females ( bataineh et al. 1998 ; chattopadhyay et al. 1999 ) .
therefore , in this paper , we have addressed the question : how do the environmentally available doses of copper ( 150 and 600 mg / kg ) influence the sexual behavior of bank voles ?
methods animals and housing conditions the bank voles ( myodes glareolus , schreber 1780 ) came from the laboratory colony of the institute of environmental sciences , jagiellonian university , krakow .
the original stock was obtained in 1976 from the mammal research institute of the polish academy of sciences ( bialowieza ) and is maintained as an outbred stock colony , according to the system described by green ( 1966 ) .
briefly , each generation consists of at least 22 breeding pairs ; the male and female of each mating pair do not share parents or grandparents .
this breeding system ensures the heterogeneity of the colony ( green 1966 ) .
the animals are housed in polyethylene cages ( 40 cm x 25 cm x 15 cm ) under a 14 h photoperiod ( 7 a.m .
- 9 p.m. light , 9 p.m .
- 7 a.m. dark ) at 21 +/ - 1 degreesc and 60 % humidity .
wood shavings are provided as bedding material and changed once a week .
standard pelleted chow for laboratory rodents ( labofeed h , kcynia ) and liquid in the form of deionized water or solutions of copper are available ad libitum .
for the study , at 19 - 20 days of age the weanlings were separated from their parents and placed in clean cages .
at 4 weeks of age , 3 - 5 individuals were placed in same - sex cages .
then both females and males were randomly divided into three experimental groups .
starting from 4 weeks of age until the end of the experiments , the animals were treated with different metal solutions or given deionized water for 12 weeks .
experimental groups c - - control group given deionized water .
cu i - - ( 150 mg / kg dose ) : copper sulphate ( ii ) 5 hydrate ( cuso4 * 5h2o ) ar purity grade ( avantor , poland ) at concentration of 150 mg cu2 +/ l ( 75 mg cu2 +/ kg body weight / day ) .
cu ii - - ( 600 mg / kg dose ) : copper sulphate ( ii ) 5 hydrate ( cuso4 * 5h2o ) ar purity grade ( avantor , poland ) at concentration of 600 mg cu2 +/ l ( 300 mg cu2 +/ kg body weight / day ) .
effect of copper on bank vole behavior 2 weeks before the behavior tests , each 14 - week - old individual was placed in a separate cage .
individuals of similar body weight were chosen for each behavioral experiment .
on the day of the test the animals were transferred with their home cages to a bio - acoustic chamber for 1 h for habituation prior to testing .
male - female interactions the behavior and vocalization of male - female pairs were recorded during open - field tests in the following combinations : malec vs. femalec ; malecu i vs. femalec ; malecu ii vs. femalec .
after habituation , the female and male were transferred from their home cages to a glass vivarium ( 40 x 20 x 25 cm ) with the floor covered with clean wood shavings .
the vivarium was divided by a metal partition into two halves , each occupied by one animal , and left undisturbed for 5 min prior to the test .
after this period the partition was removed , and the behavior and vocalizations were recorded for 10 min .
observations were made between 8 a.m. and noon .
behavior was recorded with a sony dcr - hc30e digital camera .
sounds were recorded with an ultrasound microphone suspended 10 cm above the tested animals .
the ultrasound microphone was connected to a qmc ( uk ) type s30 ultrasound detector coupled to a sony ( japan ) mz - rh10 minidisk recorder .
the behavior and sound recordings were started and terminated simultaneously .
twelve pairs from each of the aforementioned combinations , in which the animals approached each other during the 10 - min testing period were further analyzed .
the behavior of males and females during the 10 - min sessions was analyzed using a vlc media player .
amicable behavior was assessed as : - latency of nonaggressive approach ( in sec ) after removal of the partition ; first physical contact or sniffing at distance less than 1 cm - number of nonaggressive approaches - time spent sniffing ( in sec ) - self - grooming ( in sec ) - environment investigation ( in sec ) .
aggressive behavior was assessed as : - latency of attack ( in sec ) after removal of the partition - number of aggressive approaches , boxing and wrestling - time spent fighting ( in sec ) .
" approach " was defined as directional locomotion toward the other animal .
a " sniff " was recorded when the individual directed its nose to within ca .
0.5 cm of the other individual .
" total activity " was taken as the sum of approaches and sniffs toward the other animal during the test .
the recorded signals were copied from the minidisc to a computer and analyzed using spectraplus ver .
2.32 ( sound technology inc. , campbell , usa ) .
latency ( in sec ) and the number of emitted ultrasounds in the 10 - min recording were noted .
female sexual preference tests were performed in a glass vivarium divided into three equal compartments with the floor covered with clean wood shavings .
the vivarium was changed to a clean one before each test .
as described above , the females were transferred with their home cages to a bio - acoustic chamber for habituation for 1 h prior to testing .
then , 5 min before recording , the female was transferred from the home cage to the middle section of a vivarium .
two males anaesthetized with vetbutal ( 0.1 ml / 10 g body weight ; biowet , pulawy , poland ) were placed in each of the two side compartments and the partitions were removed .
the males were anaesthetized due to concern that their variable behavior would complicate the task of interpreting the behavioral response of the females .
female behavior was recorded in the following combinations : femalec vs. malec & malecu i ; femalec vs. malec & malecu ii ; namely , each female was exposed to control and cu experimental group males ( either cu i or cu ii ) located randomly in the vivarium .
the behavior of the 12 females from each of these combinations was taped with a sony dcr - hc30e digital video camera for 10 min , beginning as soon as the female had sniffed each male once .
the number of female - to - male approaches , the number of sniffs , and the time spent sniffing each male were measured using vlc media player software .
approaches and sniffs were defined as described above .
the researchers who performed and analyzed the behavioral tests were blind to the experimental group during those procedures .
statistical analysis the following statistical tests were used to analyze the data : - kruskal - wallis one - way test for nonparametric analysis : for latency of nonaggressive approach , aggressive approach and ultrasound emission ; for time of sniffs , attacks , environmental activity and self - grooming ; - one way anova : number of sniffs , attacks , nonaggressive and aggressive approaches , ultrasounds ; - post - hoc tukey test following one way anova , and mann - whitney u test following kruskal - wallis one way test : to test the significance of differences between means ; - wilcoxon matched - pairs test for dependent samples in preference tests ; for number of approaches , number and duration of sniffs , total activity .
all procedures employed statistica v .

number of tested females - - 12 .
means +/ - s.e discussion the vast majority of publications concerning the influence of copper on rodents' behavior present findings on rodent models of human diseases .
so - called toxic milk mice as well as long - evans cinnamon rats are animal models for wilson disease ( theophilos et al. 1996 ; yoshida et al. 1987 ) .
a genetic disorder of copper metabolism occurs in those animal models as well as in human patients with wilson disease ( ala et al. 2007 ; allen et al. 2006 ) .
in those individuals , copper accumulates mainly in the liver and the brain ; consequently , liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to a diagnosis ( ala et al. 2007 ) .
behavioral disturbances have been observed in toxic milk mice and in long - evans cinnamon rats ( fujiwara et al. 2006 ; przybylkowski et al. 2013 ; terwel et al. 2011 ) .
in the context of findings on copper - induced hormonal disorders , sexual behavior might be expected to be affected by copper exposure .
for this reason , our study included behavioral tests of male - female interactions .
at both tested concentrations , copper did not influence bank vole social or aggressive behavior , in contrast to results from other research .
in rats , oral administration of 200 mg / kg copper sulphate , a dose similar to the lower dose in our experiments , led to neurobehavioral abnormalities manifested in reduced latency to fall in a rotarod and lower attention percentage scores ( kumar et al. 2015 ) .
long - term ingestion of copper chloride suppressed the sexual behavior of male rats ( bataineh et al .
1998 ) , but that effect occurred after exposure to a much higher cu dose ( 1000 mg / kg ) than used in this study .
our experiments used copper doses equivalent to environmental levels found in polluted districts .
the results of this work may better represent the effects of normally presented copper concentrations in polluted areas .
one element of sexual behavior is sexual selection .
in bank voles , the females choose the sexual partner , while the males attract females using olfactory and auditory cues ( gipps 1985 ; kapusta 2012 ; kruczek 2007 ; kruczek and pochron 1997 ) .
production , excretion and emission of olfactory and auditory signals might be expected to be modified by copper .
in our behavioral experiment the males were given copper in solution and the females were given only deionized water .
we chose to use open - field two - choice preference tests to examine female sexual preference , because all research of the mammalian research group has employed the same methodology , making it easy to compare results .
in these tests , control females were subjected to two anesthetized males of similar size , so their choice would be based mainly on olfactory cues .
the females showed a clear preference for control males when subjected to a control and a male treated with 600 mg / kg copper .
exposure to 600 mg / kg copper decreased male sexual attractiveness , probably due to disorders of olfactory cue production and excretion .
in the wild , reproductive success requires social , aggressive and sexual behavior .
based on our results , it is not possible to state that copper interferes with social and aggressive behavior , but the findings show that a high level of copper definitely interferes with olfactory cue production .
copper impairs lower vertebrates' chemical communication abilities and behavior , including sexual behavior ( lahman et al. 2015 ) .
there is no published data on rodent females' sexual preference for particular males after chronic exposure to copper .
copper may become an oxidative stress factor ; in mice this stress may reduce male investment in the molecular components of olfactory signaling essential for mate attraction ( garratt et al. 2014 ) .
this mechanism might also operate in the bank vole ; it would explain the females' loss of interest in males treated with 600 mg / kg copper .
funding this study was funded by grants from the jagiellonian university ( grant number : ds / mnd / wbinoz / inos '/ 22 / 2013 ) .
compliance with ethical standards conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest .
ethical approval all applicable international , national , and / or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed ( approval of the regional committee on animal experimentation in krakow ; protocol no. 36 / 2009 ) .

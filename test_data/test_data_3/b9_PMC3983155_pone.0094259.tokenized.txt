alpha - synuclein ( asn ) plays an important role in pathogenesis of parkinson 's disease ( pd ) and other neurodegenerative disorders .
novel and most interesting data showed elevated tauopathy in pd and suggested relationship between asn and tau protein .
however , the mechanism of asn - evoked tau protein modification is not fully elucidated .
in this study we investigated the role of extracellular asn in tau hyperphosphorylation in rat pheochromocytoma ( pc12 ) cells and the involvement of glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta ( gsk - 3beta ) and cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( cdk5 ) in asn - dependent tau modification .
our results indicated that exogenously added asn increases tau phosphorylation at ser396 .
accordingly , the gsk - 3beta inhibitor ( sb - 216763 ) prevented asn - evoked tau hyperphosphorylation , but the cdk5 inhibitor had no effect .
moreover , western blot analysis showed that asn affected gsk - 3beta via increasing of protein level and activation of this enzyme .
gsk - 3beta activity evaluated by its phosphorylation status assay showed that asn significantly increased the phosphorylation of this enzyme at tyr216 with parallel decrease in phosphorylation at ser9 , indicative of stimulation of gsk - 3beta activity .
moreover , the effect of asn on microtubule ( mt ) destabilization and cell death with simultaneous the involvement of gsk - 3beta in these processes were analyzed .
asn treatment increased the amount of free tubulin and concomitantly reduced the amount of polymerized tubulin and sb - 216763 suppressed these asn - induced changes in tubulin , indicating that gsk - 3beta is involved in asn - evoked mt destabilization .
asn - induced apoptotic processes lead to decrease in pc12 cells viability and sb - 216763 protected those cells against asn - evoked cytotoxicity .
concluding , extracellular asn is involved in gsk - 3beta - dependent tau hyperphosphorylation , which leads to microtubule destabilization .
gsk - 3beta inhibition may be an effective strategy for protecting against asn - induced cytotoxicity .

introduction alpha - synuclein ( asn ) is a 140 - amino acid , presynaptic protein which in physiological conditions is involved in dopaminergic system function [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
however , under pathological conditions asn changes its native conformation , becomes an insoluble self - aggregate to form oligomers and polymers and accumulates into intraneuronal inclusions called lewy bodies ( lbs ) [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
asn in its oligomeric form plays a key role in the pathogenesis of parkinson 's disease ( pd ) and other synucleinopathies , but the mechanism by which asn contributes to neural degeneration remains unknown [ 5 ] .
more recent evidence suggests that extracellular asn oligomers play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration progression [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
also , our previous in vitro studies showed that asn is secreted from the synaptic endings into the extracellular space during oxidative stress , and exogenously added asn may evoke cell death [ 8 ] .
a growing body of evidence suggests that asn in neurodegenerative processes acts together with other amyloidogenic peptides , including amyloid - beta peptide ( abeta ) .
in our previous studies we indicated that extracellularly applied asn increases the secretion of abeta and potentiates its toxicity , thus leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase - dependent pc12 cell death [ 9 ] .
previously published data indicated a relationship between asn and the microtubule associated protein ( map ) - tau in neurodegenerative processes .
also , more often clinical evidence has shown a strong association between tauopathies and synucleinopathies , where abnormalities in both proteins , map - tau and asn , have been described [ 4 ] , [ 10 ] - [ 13 ] .
asn - positive structures have been found in various brain regions in patients with sporadic and familial alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) ; lbs were detected in the amygdala of ad and down 's syndrome [ 4 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 13 ] .
furthermore , in individuals with sporadic pd or dementia with lbs , tau - immunoreactive lbs were observed [ 11 ] .
the major function of tau , like other maps , is stabilization and regulation of microtubule ( mt ) dynamics necessary for neurite outgrowth , morphogenesis , axonal transport and normal neuronal functions [ 14 ] .
therefore , the microtubule destabilization could cause neurodegeneration .
recently , it has been proposed that microtubule destabilization plays a role in dopaminergic neurons loss [ 15 ] .
tau can interact with the plasma membrane and may play a role in relaying signals to the cytoskeleton from the cell surface or the scaffolding signalling complexes [ 16 ] .
tau activity is regulated by phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycles .
phosphorylation at specific sites detaches tau from mts and allows mt depolymerization , while tau dephosphorylation enables it to bind and stabilize the mt [ 17 ] - [ 19 ] .
although tau contains approximately 85 potential phosphorylation sites in its longest isoform , phosphorylation at ser396 seems to play a pivotal role for its function and in particular destabilizes microtubules [ 19 ] - [ 22 ] .
increased tau phosphorylation at ser396 has been found in synaptic - enriched fractions both in ad frontal cortex and pd brains along with phosphorylated asn [ 12 ] , [ 19 ] .
in neurodegenerative disorders , such as ad and pd , hyperphosphorylation of tau leads to intracellular accumulation of this protein and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles ( nfts ) .
in pd , tau has been described as a component incorporated into the filaments in lbs and co - localized with asn [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
it was suggested that toxic interaction with asn may lead to hyperphosphorylation of tau and , eventually , to the deposition of both proteins in pd [ 19 ] .
the significance of extracellular asn in tau phosphorylation and mt instability , which could be involved in the mechanisms of dopaminergic cell death , is unknown .
therefore , this study was performed to investigate the effect of exogenous asn on phosphorylation state of tau , microtubule stability and death in pc12 cells .
moreover , the involvement of two major tau - kinases : glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta ( gsk - 3beta ) and cyclin - dependent kinase ( cdk5 ) in asn - evoked tau modification , mt destabilization and death was evaluated .
taken together , our data indicated that extracellular asn induces gsk - 3beta - dependent tau modulation and we suggest that proapoptotic effect of asn might be mediated at least in part by the gsk - 3beta - catalyzed tau hyperphosphorylation , which leads to the tubulin depolymerization and in further consequence to impairment of cytoskeleton stability .
finally , the effects of asn can be largely prevented by inhibition of gsk - 3beta kinase .
gsk - 3beta inhibition may be an effective strategy for protecting against asn - induced cytotoxicity .
thus , one of the mechanisms by which asn could mediate pc12 cell death is the disruption of tubulin polymerization into microtubules ( microtubules destabilization ) , the cell 's structural support system .

results in the present study we investigated the effect of exogenous asn on map - tau protein in pc12 cells .
the tau phosphorylation status was analyzed by the tem immunogold method .
ultrathin sections were analyzed and the mean number of gold particles representing the p - tau protein was calculated .
as presented in figure 1 , the mean number of gold particles was significantly higher in the asn - treated cells ( 35.70 +/ - 6.40 ) ( figure 1b1 , 1b2 , 1b3 and figure 1c ) when compared to the control cells ( 25.10 +/ - 3.75 ) ( p = 0.001 ) ( figure 1a and figure 1c ) .
the immunogold result was confirmed by western blot analysis .
exogenously added asn ( 10 mum ) significantly increased the level of p - tau ( ser396 ) by about 80 % as compared to the control cells ( figure 2a and b ) .
to evaluate the role of two major tau - kinases : gsk - 3beta and cdk5 in asn - evoked tau phosphorylation , the inhibitors of these enzymes were used .
our results indicated that the gsk - 3beta inhibitor ( sb - 216763 , 10 mum ) prevented p - tau ( ser396 ) formation ( figure 2a lane 4 and figure 2b ) .
however , the potent cdk5 inhibitor ( bml - 259 , 10 mum ) did not protect the cells against asn - induced tau hyperphosphorylation ( figure 2a lane 3 and figure 2b ) .

to study the influence of asn on gsk - 3beta expression , we analyzed the level of mrna using a real - time pcr ( rt - pcr ) and the immunoreactivity of this enzyme by western blot analysis .
asn treatment significantly increased gsk - 3beta immunoreactivity by about 24 % ( figure 3a and 3b ) without effect on the mrna level ( figure 3c ) .
gsk - 3beta activation was evaluated by measurement of its phosphorylation status at ser9 and tyr216 .
as presented in figure 4a , exogenously added asn evoked a 37 % decrease in the immunoreactivity of p - gsk - 3beta ( ser9 ) with a parallel 30 % increase in the p - gsk - 3beta ( tyr216 ) level ( figure 4b ) , thus indicating stimulation of gsk - 3beta activity .

to evaluate the effect of asn on microtubule stability , we determined the amounts of free and polymerized tubulin .
our studies showed that exogenously added asn ( 10 mum ) significantly increased the amount of free tubulin and reduced the amount of polymerized tubulin as compared to the control group ( figure 5a lane 2 and figure 5b ) .
sb - 216763 , an inhibitor of gsk - 3beta kinase , prevented these asn - induced changes in tubulin ( figure 5a lane 3 and figure 5b ) .
moreover , to confirm the accuracy of this method , we used taxol ( 0.1 mum ) , a microtubule stabilizer as a negative control and colchicine ( 0.1 mum ) , as a positive control .
colchicine binds irreversibly to tubulin dimers and prevents addition of tubulin molecules to the fast - growing end thereby inhibiting microtubule assembly ( figure 5a lane 5 ) .
in contrast to the colchicine , taxol prevents disassembly of tubulin dimers thereby stabilizing microtubule and inducing bundling of microtubules ( figure 5a lane 6 ) .

a morphological examination of the cell nuclei stained with dna - binding fluorochrome hoechst 33258 showed that the pc12 cells exposed to 10 mum asn presented typical apoptotic morphology , including condensation of chromatin and nuclear fragmentation .
about 5 % of the cells presented typical apoptotic morphology in the asn group as compared to the control ( ca. 1.5 % of the total ) ( figure 6b1 and 6b2 ) .
a decreased manifestation of apoptotic morphology ( ca .
1.4 % of the total ) was observed when the cells were treated with exogenous asn together with the gsk - 3beta inhibitor sb - 216763 ( 10 mum ) ( figure 6b1 and 6b2 ) .

discussion a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders , including pd and ad , is characterized by neuronal damage that may be caused by toxic proteins in oligomeric form [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
oligomers of asn are believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of pd and are implicated in other neurodegenerative disorders .
however , the underlying mechanism by which asn affects neuronal function and death remains unclear .
novel data have shown elevated tauopathy in pd and have suggested a relationship between asn and the tau protein , thus indicating a dualism in neurodegeneration [ 30 ] .
however , there are no data concerning the role of asn in tau modification and the eventual consequences of asn / tau interplay in the cell death machinery .
a growing body of evidence and our previous data have indicated that asn acts together with other amyloidogenic peptides in neurodegenerative processes , including the abeta and tau proteins .
we have previously shown that extracellular asn enhanced the release of abeta peptides from app ( amyloid precursor protein ) - expressing pc12 cells and potentiated its toxicity , thus leading to nitric oxide ( no ) - mediated irreversible mitochondria dysfunction and caspase - dependent programmed cell death [ 9 ] .
on the basis of the existing data and in light of our own results we hypothesized that the tau protein plays an important role in asn - evoked cytotoxicity and in pd pathology .
in this study we have shown , for the first time that extracellularly added asn in monomeric / oligomeric form increases tau phosphorylation on ser396 , leads to the tubulin depolymerization and that the gsk - 3beta inhibitor protects cells against asn - evoked both tau hyperphosphorylation and mt destabilization .
moreover , we showed that asn activated gsk - 3beta via affecting its phosphorylation status .
finally , asn - induced apoptotic processes led to pc12 cell death , and the gsk - 3beta inhibitor attenuated asn - evoked cytotoxicity and enhanced pc12 cells viability .
hyperphosphorylation of tau has been indicated in various models of parkinsonism and synucleinopathies and it was suggested that asn could initiate tau changes [ 3 ] - [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
frasier et al. demonstrated that mice overexpressing a30p asn develop abnormally phosphorylated tau in parallel with the accumulation of aggregated asn [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] .
association of tau pathology with synucleinopathies was also found by duka et al. , who demonstrated the asn - mediated hyperphosphorylation of tau at ser396 / 404 in the 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine ( mptp ) model of parkinsonism [ 31 ] .
in addition , tau pathology was observed in both the platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) - asn mice and patients with pd [ 3 ] .
khandelwal et al. detected an increase in tau phosphorylation at ser396 , ser202 / thr205 and thr231 in asn - injected brains [ 32 ] .
moreover , in vitro incubation of tau and asn synergistically promoted the fibrillization of both proteins [ 19 ] .
since the two major protein kinases , gsk - 3beta and cdk5 , are involved in tau phosphorylation [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 20 ] , we determined the contribution of these enzymes in asn - induced tau phosphorylation .
our results showed that only sb - 216763 , a gsk - 3beta inhibitor , had a protective effect and prevented against asn - evoked tau hyperphosphorylation without the effect of the cdk5 inhibitor .
thus , these results indicate the significant role of gsk - 3beta in asn - induced tau phosphorylation .
the question arises as to what kind of mechanism is responsible for asn - induced gsk - 3beta activation .
gsk - 3beta activity is regulated by serine ( inhibitory ) and tyrosine ( stimulatory ) phosphorylation , by its subcellular localization , by the formation of protein complexes containing gsk - 3beta and by the phosphorylation state of gsk - 3beta substrates via other kinases [ 33 ] .
the activity of gsk - 3beta can be reduced by phosphorylation of ser9 , while optimal activation occurs through phosphorylation at tyr216 [ 4 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 33 ] .
therefore , we examined the effect of exogenous asn on the phosphorylation status of gsk - 3beta at these two specific sites .
our data showed that exogenously added asn significantly decreased the phosphorylation of gsk - 3beta at ser9 with a parallel increase in phosphorylation at tyr216 , thus indicating activation of this enzyme .
duka et al. showed that in several in vitro and in vivo experimental models of pd , gsk - 3beta was activated by phosphorylation at tyr216 in the presence of asn , which then led to tau hyperphosphorylation at ser262 and ser396 / 404 [ 11 ] .
in a report by haggerty et al. , in both the pdgf - asn - overexpressing mice and pd patients , gsk - 3beta was phosphorylated at tyr216 with parallel tau hyperphosphorylation [ 3 ] .
kawakami et al. showed the stimulatory effect of asn on the autophosphorylation of gsk - 3beta ( although many authors support the idea that tyr phosphorylation is regulated , there is also evidences that the tyr phosphorylation of gsk - 3 might be an autophosphorylation event catalysed by gsk - 3 itself [ 34 ]) leading to its activation and gsk - 3beta - mediated hyperphosphorylation of tau [ 18 ] .
the effect of asn on gsk - 3beta and the increase in tau phosphorylation may explain the protective effect of gsk - 3beta inhibitors on pc12 cells viability .
however , the precise mechanism by which exogenous asn contributes to the activation of gsk - 3beta and , in consequence , to gsk - 3beta - dependent tau hyperphosphorylation remains to be elucidated .
our data have suggested that asn affected gsk - 3beta activity by modulating a ratio of phosphorylated and non - phosphorylated form of protein. from the literature data it follows that are several theories which attempt to explain the mechanism , by which asn could affect on gsk - 3beta activation .
one of them assumes that asn translocates into the cells and forms protein complexes with gsk - 3beta , which then leads to changes in protein folding and structure [ 11 ] .
asn may initiate the activation of gsk - 3beta by recruiting this enzyme , possibly by direct protein - protein interaction , which may in turn promote conformational changes in gsk - 3beta , thus resulting in its autophosphorylation [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
it is also assumed that asn functions as a connecting mediator for tau and gsk - 3beta and forms a heterotrimeric complex .
it was suggested that nac domain and an acidic region of asn are responsible for stimulation of gsk - 3beta - mediated tau phosphorylation [ 18 ] .
our data demonstrate an increase in the total level of gsk - 3beta with a lack of changes in gene expression for this enzyme following treatment of exogenous asn .
these data may indicate either an increase in protein translation or the inhibition of processes leading to its degradation , thus causing the consequent increase in protein stability and level .
however , the mechanism of gsk - 3beta activation requires further study and remains to be elucidated .
it is well documented that tau is cytoskeleton protein and its binding to mt is dependent on its phosphorylation state .
highly phosphorylated tau is less able to bind and assemble microtubules [ 17 ] - [ 19 ] .
in our study , we demonstrated that asn - induced microtubule destabilization ( tubulin depolymerization ) is caused by probable reduction in the binding capacity of tau to mt ( s ) , which is a result of tau phosphorylation via gsk - 3beta activation .
this suggests that gsk - 3beta has an important role in asn - evoked mt destabilization .
disruption of tubulin polymerization into microtubules was found by chen et al. , who demonstrated the inhibition of tubulin polymerization in a dopaminergic cell line inducted by oligomeric asn [ 35 ] .
also lee et al. demonstrated the disruption of the microtubule network , impairment of mt - dependent trafficking and neuritic degeneration in sh - sy5y cells overexpressing asn [ 36 ] .
zhou et al. detected that asn inhibited microtubule formation in the cultured cells , with a length - dependent phenomenon [ 37 ] .
asn aggregation , which occurs in pd , dlb and normal aging , has been reported to inhibit tubulin polymerization [ 38 ] .
since microtubules are involved in cytoskeletal formation , in the regulation of mitotic apparatus , in the transport of intracellular organelles such as mitochondria , in axonal transport and normal neuronal functions ; disruption of microtubules ( mt destabilization ) can induce cell cycle arrest in m phase , formation of abnormal mitotic spindles , inhibition intracellular transport and final triggering of signals for apoptosis [ 15 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
in this study we have shown that extracellularly added asn induced apoptotic processes leading to decrease of pc12 cells viability .
sb - 216763 protected those cells against asn - evoked cytototoxicity. from these results , we propose that microtubule dysfunction and the associated cellular function impairment might be critical components in the mechanism of asn - induced cell defects leading to death .
taken together , these studies provide evidence that extracellular asn is involved in gsk - 3beta - dependent tau modulation and that its proapoptotic effect might be mediated at least in part by gsk - 3beta - catalysed tau hyperphosphorylation , which leads to the tubulin depolymerization and in further consequence may impair cytoskeleton stability .
gsk - 3beta inhibitors may be used as a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract the effects of asn toxicity in synucleinopathies .
in our study we identified the potential mechanism by which extracellular asn may disrupt microtubule integrity in pc12 cells , which can provide insights into the early pathogenic mechanism of pd and other synucleinopathies .

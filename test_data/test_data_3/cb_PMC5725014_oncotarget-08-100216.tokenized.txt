apigenin is a naturally occurring compound with anti - inflammatory , antioxidant , and anticancer properties .
here , we investigated the effects of apigeninin inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) and colitis - associated cancer ( cac ) .
apigenin effectively inhibited ulcerative colitis , a type of ibd , and cac .
apigenin decreased myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) , inflammatory cytokine and cox - 2 levels , and it attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration in treated colon tissues as compared to untreated model colon tissues .
apigenin also reduced nf - kappab and stat3 activity in vitro and in vivo , thereby inhibiting inflammation and inflammation - induced carcinogenesis .
thus apigenin appears to inhibit inflammation and inflammation - induced carcinogenesisin ibd and cac by suppressing stat3 - nf - kappab signaling .
apigenin ibd cac nf - kappab stat3 introduction apigenin ( 4 ' , 5,7 - trihydroxyflavone , 5,7 - dihydroxy - 2 - ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) - 4h - 1 - benzopyran - 4 - one ) , a naturally - occurring plant flavone present in many fruits , vegetables , and herbs , has anti - inflammatory , antioxidant , and anticancer effects [ 1 ] .
the anti - inflammatory effects of apigenin have been extensively investigated [ 2 , 3 ] .
inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) is a common disease affecting millions of people , and its incidence increases rapidly every year [ 4 ] .
accumulating evidence indicates that colitis - associated cancer ( cac ) is strongly associated with ibd [ 5 , 6 ] .
in ibd , inflammatory cytokines contribute to the formation of a tumor - supportive microenvironment [ 7 , 8 ] .
chronicinflammation increases the risk of cac , which often leads to death ; cac is therefore regarded a serious complication of ibd [ 9 , 10 ] .
however , the efficacy of the drugs currently used to treat ibd and prevent cac is relatively poor [ 11 ] .
a better understanding of the association between inflammation and colon cancer may lead to the identification of novel methods for preventing cac .
activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappab ( nf - kappab ) regulates various genes involved in early inflammatory response [ 12 ] .
the nf - kappab signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of intestinal inflammation .
nf - kappab signaling is activated in mucosal ibd cells and in colorectal carcinoma patients .
modulation of nf - kappab activity is therefore a target of ibd treatments [ 13 ] .
moreover , activation of oncogenic transcription factors , such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( stat3 ) , induces colorectal carcinoma .
greatly elevated levels of inflammatory cytokinesin early colonic lesions in a mouse model of colorectal cancer are associated with enhanced stat3 / nf - kb activation [ 14 ] .
additionally , a positive feedback loop maintains epigenetic transformations in neoplastic cells for many generations in the absence of an inducing signal [ 15 ] .
we previously showed that apigenin inhibits epithelial - mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma via the nf - kappab signaling pathway [ 16 ] .
here , we examined whether apigenin exerts anti - ibd and - cac effects by modulating the stat3 - nf - kappab pathway .
results apigenin protects against chronic uc in mice the effects of lentinan treatment on ibd were examinedusing chronic uc mouse models .
we induced chronic uc in c57bl / 6 mice through oral administration of 1 % dss for 21 days .
apigenin was administered 24 h after dss administration ( figure 1a ) .
dss inhibited normal growth and reduced mouse body weights , and apigenin ameliorated weight loss in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 1b ) .
dai values were lower in the apigenin group than in the model group , which was consistent with the observed effects on bodyweight ( figure 1c ) .
as shown in figure 1d , apigenin also inhibited dss - induced colon shortening in a dose - dependent manner .

apigenin inhibits colon damage and inflammatory cytokine production in uc mice colon tissues fromchronic uc mice displayed granulated intestinal mucosa , superficial ulcer formation , and local mucosal hyperemia and edema .
apigenin ameliorated these types of colonic damage and reduced colon macroscopic damage scores ( figure 2a ) .
severe inflammatory lesions , crypt erosion , and immune cell infiltration were observed in histological sections of colorectal tissues from chronic uc mice .
apigenin reduced the severity of colitis , thereby reducing microscopic damage scores ( figure 2b ) .

mpo levels were higher in the uc model group than in the control and apigenin groups .
levels of the inflammatory cytokinestnf - alpha , il - 1beta , il - 6 , mcp - 1 , and csf - 1 and of cox - 2 were measured in mice with chronic colitis .
all cytokine and cox - 2 levels were higher in the model group than in the control group .
moreover , apigenin decreased all cytokine and cox - 2 levels in a dose - dependent manner .
apigenin protects against cac in mice an animal model of cac was established to assess the protective effects of apigenin ( figure 3a ) .
mouse body weights decreased substantially after each round of exposure to dss ; this weight loss was partially reversed when dss was withdrawn .
apigenin dose - dependently inhibited weight loss compared to model group mice ( figure 3b ) .
dai values were lower in the apigenin group than in the model group , consistent with the bodyweight results ( figure 3c ) .
survival curves showed that apigenin treatment increased the survival rate in cac mice ( figure 3d ) .
macroscopic colon images are shown in figure 3e .
the average number of tumors per mouse , tumor load , and tumor size were all lower in apigenin - treated mice than in model group mice ( figure 3f - 3h ) .
histological examination revealed that apigen in treatment reduced tumor numbers and sizes and attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration , atypical hyperplasia , and nuclear atypia in treated colon tissues compared to colon tissues from model group mice ( figure 3i and 3j ) .

apigenin inhibits production of inflammatory cytokines and colon cancer markers levels of the inflammatory cytokines tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , il - 6 , mcp - 1 , and csf - 1 and of cox - 2were increased in tumors andsurrounding tissues inmodel group mice compared to the other groups .
moreover , inflammatory cytokine and cox - 2 levels were higher in tumor tissues than in the surrounding tissues ( figure 4a ) .
mpo levels in tumor and surrounding tissues were also increased in the model group compared to the other groups and were higher in tumor tissues than in surrounding tissues ( figure 4b ) .
an ihc assay showed that apigenin reduced expression of the colon cancer markers cea , ck8 , ck18 , and p53in colorectal tissues from cac mice ( figure 4c and 4d ) .

apigenin inhibits the stat3 / nf - kappab pathway in colon carcinoma cells lipopolysaccharides ( lpss ) are toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) that activate the nf - kappab signaling pathway .
we used are porter gene assay and western blot analysis to examine the effects of apigenin on nf - kappab expression and activation induced by 5 mug / ml lps in the hct - 116 colonic epithelial cancer cell line .
apigenin downregulated nf - kappab in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 5a and 5b ) .
previous studies have demonstrated that stat3 interacts with nf - kappab in cancer cells .
as shown in figure 5c and 5d , apigenin also downregulated stat3 in a dose - dependent manner .
we then examined the effects of apigenin on lps - induced il - 6 and il - 10 secretion .
apigenin reduced levels of both il - 6 and il - 10 ( figure 5e ) .
next , hct - 116 cells were treated either with or without lps in the presence or absence of ho - 3867 ( 20mum ) , a specific stat3 inhibitor .
pretreatment with ho - 3867 attenuated lps - induced nf - kappab phosphorylation ( figure 5f ) , but apigenin did not further reduce nf - kappab phosphorylation ( figure 5f ) .

apigenin inhibits the stat3 / nf - kappab pathway in colitis - associated colon cancer tumor tissues in cancer tissues , apigenin reduced phosphorylation of both nf - kappab at p65 and stat3 in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 6a ) .
these results indicate that apigenin inhibited nf - kappab activation by inhibitingstat3 activity ( figure 6b ) .

discussion apigenin has anti - inflammatory and anti - tumor activities in various cancer cells with little cytotoxicity , but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear [ 17 - 19 ] .
our results showed that apigenin was an effective treatment againstchronic uc. apigenin reduced levels of mpo , inflammatory cytokines , and cox - 2 andattenuated inflammatory cell infiltration in colon tissues compared to untreatedmodel colon tissues .
long - term ibd increases the risk of cac [ 20 ] .
in ibd , inflammatory cytokines contribute to the formation of a tumor - supportive microenvironment [ 21 ] .
our results also demonstrated that apigenin inhibited cac by reducing neutrophil infiltration and levels of colon cancer markers , mpo , inflammatory cytokines , and cox - 2 .
histological examination revealed that apigenin treatment reduced tumor counts and average tumorsize andattenuated inflammatory cell infiltration , atypical hyperplasia , and nuclear atypia in colon tissue compared to untreated model colon tissues .
additionally , apigenin increased mediansurvival times in mice compared to mice in the untreated model group .
we previously found that apigenin inhibits hepatocellular carcinomavia the nf - kappab signaling pathway [ 16 ] .
studies suggest that nf - kappab signaling is a critical link between inflammation and carcinogenesis [ 22 ]. moreover , nf - kappab activation plays a key role in the upregulation of intestinal epithelial permeability [ 23 ] .
lps induces the activation of multiple proinflammatory transcription factors and signaling pathways , including nf - kappab [ 24 ] .
furthermore , the nf - kappab signaling pathway plays a central role in mediating inflammatory signalsand in controlling the production of proinflammatory mediators , especially in ibd and cac [ 22 ] .
tlr4 ligation by lps promotes phosphorylation of nf - kappab and degradation of i - kappab , which liberates nf - kappab and leads to its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation [ 25 ] .
here , apigenin downregulated nf - kappab phosphorylation in a dose - dependent manner in lps - treated hct - 116 cells .
this result differsfrom our previous findings that apigenin treatment decreased both nf - kappab expression and activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells .
the effects of apigenin on nf - kappab might therefore vary in different cancer cells .
stat family proteins , especially stat3 , are closely associated with nf - kappab signaling [ 26 - 28 ] .
studies in cancercells demonstrated that direct interactions between stat3 and nf - kappab contribute to inflammation [ 29 ] .
moreover , this interaction is facilitated primarily by il - 6 , which forms annf - kappab - il - 6 - stat3 loop that prolongs nf - kappab activation in cancer cells [ 30 ] .
persistently activated stat3 maintains constitutive nf - kappab activity in tumors [ 29 ] .
stat3 and nf - kappab are involved in the interplay between immune / inflammatory and malignant cells , and activation of these transcription factors promotes crc cell proliferation and survival [ 30 , 31 ] .
we therefore examined whether apigenin alters activation of stat3 pathway in this study .
apigenin downregulated stat3 phosphorylation , but not total stat3 levels .
however , apigenin did not further attenuate nf - kappab phosphorylation after pretreatment with ho - 3867 , a stat3 inhibitor .
this result indicates that apigenin inhibited the nf - kappab - stat3 loopby directly inhibiting stat3 , which in turn inhibitednf - kappab .
apigenin - induced inhibition ofstat3 and nf - kappabmay therefore becrucial to itsability to inhibit colonic carcinoma progression .
in summary , our results suggest that apigenin inhibits inflammation and inflammation - induced carcinogenesis in general , and ibd and cac specifically , by suppressing stat3 - nf - kappab signaling .
these findings provide anew mechanistic basis for the therapeutic application of apigenin for the treatment of inflammation - induced carcinogenesis in patients withibd and cac .

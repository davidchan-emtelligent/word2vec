background radiotherapy is increasingly used to treat oligometastatic patients .
we sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image - guided radiotherapy ( higrt ) .
methods exclusively extracranial oligometastatic patients treated with higrt were pooled .
characteristics including age , sex , primary tumor type , interval to metastatic diagnosis , number of treated metastases and organs , metastatic site , prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment , prior definitive metastasis - directed therapy , and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival ( os ) , progression - free survival ( pfs ) , and treated metastasis control ( tmc ) were assessed by the cox proportional hazards method .
recursive partitioning analysis ( rpa ) identified prognostic risk strata for os and pfs based on pretreatment factors .
results 361 patients were included .
primary tumors included non - small cell lung ( 17 %) , colorectal ( 19 %) , and breast cancer ( 16 %) .
three - year os was 56 % , pfs was 24 % , and tmc was 72 % .
on multivariate analysis , primary tumor , interval to metastases , treated metastases number , and mediastinal / hilar lymph node , liver , or adrenal metastases were associated with os. primary tumor site , involved organ number , liver metastasis , and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with pfs .
os rpa identified five classes : class 1 : all breast , kidney , or prostate cancer patients ( bkp ) ( 3 - year os 75 % , 95 % ci 66 - 85 %) ; class 2 : patients without bkp with disease - free interval of 75 + months ( 3 - year os 85 % , 95 % ci 67 - 100 %) ; class 3 : patients without bkp , shorter disease - free interval , <= two metastases , and age < 62 ( 3 - year os 55 % , 95 % ci 48 - 64 %) ; class 4 : patients without bkp , shorter disease - free interval , >= three metastases , and age < 62 ( 3 - year os 38 % , 95 % ci 24 - 60 %) ; class 5 : all others ( 3 - year os 13 % , 95 % ci 5 - 35 %) .
higher biologically effective dose ( bed ) ( p < 0.01 ) was associated with os. conclusions we identified clinical factors defining oligometastatic patients with favorable outcomes , who we hypothesize are most likely to benefit from metastasis - directed therapy .

introduction metastases remain the leading cause of cancer death worldwide .
metastatic patients are routinely treated with systemic therapy based on the hypothesis that the presence of a single metastasis is universally associated with subclinical micrometastases .
however , data and experience suggest that malignant disease burden ranges in spectrum from locoregionally confined disease to widespread distant metastases [ 1 ] .
included in this continuum are oligometastatic ( om ) patients with metastases limited in number and destination organ who may have a more indolent disease course [ 2 ] .
ablative metastasis - directed therapies to all known tumors in om patients hypothetically could prolong disease - free interval and overall survival .
metastasis - directed therapy of focal om was first described in surgical series , resulting in long - term disease control and survival for some patients [ 3,4 ] .
technological advancements enable the delivery of fewer , more precisely targeted , high radiation doses with steep dose gradients between targets and normal tissues .
these radiosurgical - style treatments initially used for brain tumors have expanded to extracranial use .
commonly termed stereotactic body radiotherapy ( sbrt ) but perhaps more precisely and broadly called hypofractionated image - guided radiotherapy ( higrt ) , these treatments are now a standard for many different diseases with high treated - tumor control rates , including non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) , hepatocellular carcinoma , pancreatic cancer , and prostate cancer [ 5 - 9 ]. with advances in radiation techniques enabling treatment of multiple tumor sites in the same patient [ 10 ] , higrt is increasingly being used to treat all known om [ 11 ] .
prospective studies of om patients treated with higrt report promising rates of treated metastasis control ( tmc ) and acceptable toxicity rates [ 12 - 22 ] .
in these often heavily pretreated populations , similar long - term survival rates as surgical series are seen [ 23 ] .
however , most patients experience cancer progression [ 24 ] .
therefore , optimizing patient selection is critical to define those om patients most likely to benefit from higrt .
although tissue - based biomarkers of the oligometastatic state are beginning to be described , they are not yet ready to be used for patient selection [ 25 - 27 ] .
ongoing randomized trials use only the number of metastases as inclusion criteria .
however , given the growing experience treating oligometastases with higrt , we hypothesized that other pretreatment ( baseline ) clinical criteria may exist across different diseases to better define the om patients most likely to have long - term survival and benefit from metastases - directed therapy .
therefore , we performed a hypothesis - generating analysis of individual patients pooled from multiple institutional experiences , including several prospective trials to identify these criteria .
materials and methods patient cohort consecutive exclusively extracranial om (<= 5 metastases ) patients treated with definitive - intent radiation to all metastases comprised the study population .
our cohort included patients from multiple prospective clinical trials , including a dose escalation trial [ 15,28 ] , two prospective pilot studies [ 14,18 ] , and a phase i / ii study of concurrent sunitinib and higrt [ 13,29 ] , as well as patients treated off protocol , but per prior protocols .
patients could receive concurrent non - anthracycline based systemic agents , including sunitinib on protocol .
patients on or off protocol could have had any prior therapy , including definitive metastasis - directed therapy with curative intent or palliative systemic therapy , per the standards of their treating institution .
all local institutional review boards ( university of chicago , university of rochester , mt. sinai , wake forest university , and the durham va ) approved this study .
informed consent was obtained for the prospective studies that have been previously published and waived for this pooled analysis .
treatment and follow - up treatment was per institutional protocols as previously described [ 13 - 15,18,28,29 ] .
all patients underwent computed tomography ( ct ) - based treatment planning in customized immobilization devices with respiratory motion assessment and management where appropriate .
the intent of all treatments was to deliver ablative doses to all known metastases .
dose - fractionation schedule varied , with common schedules including ten fractions of 5 - 6 gy per fraction , or three fractions ranging from 8 - 16 gy per fraction .
patients were followed at standard ( approximately 3 month ) intervals for toxicity and disease control assessment with physical examination and volumetric imaging including ct and / or pet scanning .
overall survival ( os ) , progression - free survival ( pfs ) , and treated metastasis control ( tmc ) , on a per patient basis , were defined from the time of higrt .
pfs was defined as the time to death or any tumor progression , either at a treated metastasis or distant site .
tmc was defined as the time to progression at any treated metastasis within a patient .
progression was defined based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist ) [ 30 ] in the prospective studies [ 13 - 15,18,28,29 ] and based on retrospective review of imaging and clinical documentation for patients who were not treated on trial .
statistical analysis the objective of this retrospective hypothesis - generating pooled analysis was to develop criteria for prognostic risk groups for os. statistics were performed in r version 3.3.1 ( r foundation ) and source code is included in supplement ( s1 file , s2 file ) and on github [ 31 ] .
all statistical tests were 2 - sided with significance at p < 0.05 .
for all os and pfs analyses , age , sex , primary tumor site , interval to metastasis diagnosis , number of metastases treated , number of treated organs , location of metastasis , prior chemotherapy for primary treatment , prior definitive metastasis - directed therapy , or prior systemic therapy for metastasis were considered .
because data regarding systemic agents were not uniformly collected , this was not included in the analysis .
analysis of tmc did not include age and sex as they were not hypothesized to impact tmc .
os , pfs , and tmc were assessed with the kaplan - meier method , and assessment of variables impacting os , pfs , and tmc was performed with univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazards models .
parsimonious multivariate cox proportional hazards models for each were constructed based on hypothesized clinical relevance , results of univariate analysis , and consideration of stepwise backward regression .
the proportional hazards assumption was verified for all individual variables in the final multivariate models by the relationship between schoenfield residuals .
all models additionally globally met the proportional hazards assumption with the exception of pfs .
nonlinearity was assessed with plot of martingale residuals of the null cox model for continuous variables in the final os model ( time to metastasis ) .
patients with missing data were excluded in generating the corresponding univariate and multivariate models .
the binary classification tree approach with recursive partitioning analysis ( rpa ) was implemented to stratify the patients into risk groups based on os. the intent of rpa was to identify pre - treatment prognostic classes .
age , sex , primary tumor type , interval to metastasis , number of metastases treated , number of treated organs , location of metastasis , prior chemotherapy for primary treatment , prior definitive metastasis - directed therapy ( with either oligoprogressive disease at a treated or new untreated site ) , or systemic therapy for metastasis were considered as candidates by the rpa calculation , which stratifies based on stepwise binary division of groups based on variables that have more homogeneous outcomes [ 32 ] .
this is repeated until binary divisions are no longer possible .
to minimize overfitting and improve generalizability , the tree was pruned with a cost complexity parameter of 0.018 based on plotting against the cross - validation error .
the terminal nodes of the classification tree were selected as the prognostic risk groups .
the same procedure was repeated to generate a decision tree based on pfs with a complexity parameter of 0.038 .
tmc cross - validation error did not reach a local minimum and thus a generalizable model could not be generated .
due to the need for sufficient patients to sufficiently power a hypothesis - generating rpa model , the decision was made to incorporate all patients in the creation of the model rather than using them in a separate validation set .
we also performed an analysis of the relationship between biologically effective dose ( bed ) and os , pfs , and tmc , as well as that between tmc and os and pfs .
bed was calculated assuming an alpha - beta ratio of 10 gy. bedalphabeta = nxdx [ 1 + d ( alphabeta )] as different metastases in the same patient could be treated with different doses , the lowest bed per patient was used for this analysis .
this was chosen to be as conservative as possible .
os , pfs , and tmc endpoints were analyzed in a univariate fashion based on stratification of bed of 75 gy or higher ( the median bed of the cohort as well as a well - established dose commonly used for patients off protocol [ 14,18 ]) with the kaplan - meier method and log - rank test .
bed and tmc were also included in the final multivariate cox proportional hazards models for the appropriate endpoints to consider other contributing variables .

baseline patient characteristics are presented in table 1 .
the median follow - up was 26.2 months ( 35.9 for surviving patients ) .
primary tumor types included nsclc ( 17 %) , colorectal cancer ( 19 %) , and breast cancer ( 16 %) .
median time to metastases from initial cancer diagnosis was 12.0 months .
most patients received prior systemic therapy including 74 % for primary disease treatment and 70 % for metastatic disease .
thirty percent received prior definitive metastasis - directed therapy .

median tmc was not reached and 3 - year tmc was 72 % ( fig 1c ) .
on univariate analysis , cox proportional hazards models indicated that compared to breast cancer patients , those with colorectal , other gi , nsclc , sarcoma , and other primary tumor types had significantly shorter os ( table 2 ) .
other characteristics such as shorter interval to metastatic diagnosis , greater number of treated metastases , greater number of treated organs , hilar or mediastinal lymph node metastasis , and liver metastases were associated with shorter os. with adjustment on multivariate analysis , primary tumor type , interval to metastatic diagnosis , number of treated metastases , and mediastinal or hilar lymph node , liver , or adrenal metastases were independently significant .

identifying prognostic cohorts via recursive partitioning recursive partitioning analysis identified five prognostic classes for overall survival .
( fig 2a and 2b ) .
class 1 ( 3 - year os 75 % , 95 % ci 66 - 85 %) consisted of all breast , kidney , or prostate cancer patients ( bkp ) , which rpa separated as distinct from other primary tumor types .
without pruning , rpa suggested that solitary metastasis bkp patients may have superior os to those with > one metastasis .
however , this did not remain following the tree pruning process based on cross - validation error , and thus rpa was unable to further identify prognostic subclasses within class 1 .
class 2 ( 3 - year os 85 % , 95 % ci 67 - 100 %) included all patients with other diseases but with disease - free interval of >= 75 months .
patients with non - bkp disease , shorter disease - free interval (< 75 months ) , <= 2 metastases comprised class 3 ( 3 - year os 55 % , 95 % ci 48 - 64 %) .
class 4 ( 3 - year os 38 % , 95 % ci 24 - 60 %) included patients with non - bkp disease , shorter disease - free interval , >= 3 metastases , and age < 62 .
finally , class 5 included all remaining patients ( 3 - year os 13 % , 95 % ci 5 - 35 %) .
these differences in overall survival were statistically significant ( log - rank p < 0.01 ) .
based on cox proportional hazards with class 1 as the reference , hazard ratios ( hr ) were as follows : class 2 0.20 ( 95 % ci 0.04 - 0.92 ; p = 0.04 ) , class 3 2.35 ( 95 % ci 1.50 - 3.67 ; p < 0.01 ) , class 4 3.51 ( 1.96 - 6.29 ; p < 0.01 ) , and class 5 9.36 ( 95 % ci 5.38 - 16.27 ; p < 0.01 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0195149.g002 fig 2 recursive partitioning models for overall survival and progression - free survival .
for overall survival , recursive partitioning allowed stratification of patients into five prognostic classes ( a ) .
overall survival was well - stratified based on rpa class ( b ) ; log - rank p < 0.01 .
for progression - free survival , recursive partitioning allowed stratification of patients into two prognostic classes ( c ) .
progression - free survival was well - stratified based on rpa class ( d ) ; log - rank p < 0.01 .
for pfs , rpa defined only two prognostic classes as shown in fig 2c and 2d based on primary tumor type ; class 1 ( 3 - year pfs 44 % , 95 % ci 32 - 57 %) : bkp and class 2 ( 3 - year pfs 17 % , 95 % ci 13 - 23 %) : all other non - bkp primary tumor types ; log - rank p < 0.01 .
on cox proportional hazards , this result was also statistically significant ( hr 2.40 with class 1 as reference , 95 % ci 1.73 - 3.34 ; p < 0.01 ) .
impact of bed on survival univariate stratification by bed suggested a correlation between minimum bed > 75 gy with os , pfs , and tmc .
those treated with bed of >= 75 had a 3 - year os of 61 % ( 95 % ci 55 - 68 %) compared to 43 % ( 95 % ci 34 - 54 %) for those treated with bed < 75 ( p < 0.01 ; fig 3a ) .
three - year pfs for bed >= 75 gy was 27 % ( 95 % ci 21 - 34 %) versus 18 % ( 95 % ci 11 - 29 %) for bed < 75 ( p = 0.06 ; fig 3b ). with bed >= 75 gy , 3 - year tmc was 78 % ( 95 % ci 72 - 84 %) , significantly higher than that with bed < 75 gy , 55 % ( 95 % ci 44 - 68 %) ; p < 0.01 ( fig 3c ) .
incorporating bed into the multivariate os model suggested a statistically significant association ( hr 0.49 , 95 % ci 0.33 - 0.72 ; p < 0.01 ; table 2 ) .
this adjusted model including both bed and site of metastasis had a decreased effect size and significance of liver , adrenal , and bone metastases , suggesting potential correlation between higher bed and these treated sites ( hr 1.49 ( 0.85 - 2.61 ) ; p = 0.17 ) .
similarly , the adjusted model for pfs ( table 3 ) suggested a statistically significant association with bed ( hr 0.66 , 95 % ci 0.49 - 0.89 ; p = 0.01 ) .
in contrast , this appeared independent of other variables in the pfs model .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0195149.g003 fig 3 overall and progression free survival , treated metastasis control by minimum biologically effective dose ( bed ) .
bed >= 75 gy was associated with greater overall survival ( p < 0.01 ) ( a ) and treated metastasis control ( p < 0.01 ) ( c ) , with trend for progression free survival ( p = 0.06 ) ( b ) .
discussion in this large multi - institutional cohort of exclusively extracranial om patients treated with definitive higrt , we found a median progression free survival approaching 1 year and a median overall survival approaching 4 years .
furthermore , 40 % of patients were alive 6 years after metastasis directed therapy with ~ 20 % alive without progression .
these data are similar to surgical metastasectomy series [ 3,4 ] suggesting a promising role for radiotherapy treating at least limited metastatic patients not technically resectable or medically fit .
we also found specific prognostic factors associated with improved os , pfs , and tmc .
in particular , primary tumor type , time to metastatic diagnosis , number of metastases , age , and metastatic site were independently associated with overall survival .
for progression free survival , primary tumor type , number of treated organs , prior chemotherapy for primary disease , and treated liver metastases , were independent prognostic factors .
treated metastasis control was associated with primary tumor type , location of metastasis , and prior systemic therapy for metastasis .
further , we found that higher minimum bed was associated with clinical outcomes .
our series is unique amongst published reports of prognostic factors for oligometastatic patients .
first , we analyzed a large cohort of metastatic patients with a wide range of primary tumors and a variety of exclusively extracranial om sites .
this provides a broader characterization of underlying characteristics common to all oligometastatic patients irrespective of primary and secondary tumor sites .
second , the results of the os rpa demonstrate the importance and interaction of the various pre - treatment prognostic factors identified by cox proportional hazards modeling .
patients in the most favorable risk group were those with breast , renal cell , and prostate cancer , consistent with findings of a small subcohort of this study [ 29 ] .
rpa was unable to stratify this cohort further .
this suggests that other hypothesized clinical factors such as number of metastases , disease - free interval , age , or metastatic site may not play as large of a role in prognosis for these patients .
these outcomes are favorable in comparison to historical trials , particularly in breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma [ 24,33,34 ] .
for instance , in a study randomizing patients with metastatic breast cancer to paclitaxel with or without gemcitabine , 91 % of patients enrolled had <= four metastatic sites with pfs of 8 - 10 months [ 35 ] .
while colorectal cancer has been previously suspected to be a favorable disease site and has historically been treated aggressively , rpa did not pool this with bkp diseases .
this suggests that patients with colorectal cancer may be less uniformly favorable than bkp diseases and require consideration of additional factors .
for patients with other primary tumor types , a long disease - free interval (>= 75 months until metastasis development ) portended a similarly favorable prognosis .
our cohort of these patients , however , was limited to 14 patients and should be considered hypothesis - generating .
for patients with non - bkp primary tumors and shorter disease - free intervals , < three metastases was a favorable prognostic factor .
furthermore , patients with non - bkp primaries , short disease free - intervals , three or more metastases , and age >= 62 had nearly a four - fold risk of death in comparison to the entire cohort average , and a nine - fold risk in comparison to patients with bkp diseases .
these findings are important as outcomes following metastasis - directed therapy are promising for some , but many patients progress early , stressing the need to better identify patients most likely to benefit .
beyond the ability to stratify patients , long - term survival in the most favorable populations suggests clinical criteria possibly predicting for a more advantageous biology .
the three most favorable classes all had a three - year os > 50 % .
this indicates that the presented criteria predict for long - term survivors who we hypothesize are the best candidates for aggressive metastasis - directed therapies .
however , the 38 % 3 - year os of class 4 patients is better than expected for many metastatic patients , indicating that there may be some patients in classes 4 and 5 who could benefit from metastasis - directed therapy to all known metastases .
prior studies identifying risk groups of om patients have primarily focused on either specific treated organs or treatment of specific diseases and included intracranial metastases [ 16,36 - 42 ] .
many large series have identified prognostic factors in cohorts of resected pulmonary metastases [ 3 ] , resected liver metastases [ 4,16,39 ] , and oligometastatic nsclc [ 37,38,43 ] .
our findings are concordant with and integrate the findings of these studies into a larger framework .
primary tumor type is the key determining factor of our study , with various forms of adenocarcinoma ( breast and prostate ) portending the best prognosis , consistent with prior data [ 16 ] .
lengthy disease - free interval and fewer treated metastases are more detailed indicators of metachronous metastases [ 16,36 - 39 ] .
performance status has been identified in two studies [ 37,39 ] as a positive prognostic factor .
although unavailable in our cohort , most patients were treated on protocols requiring high - performance status [ 13 - 15,18,28,29 ] .
the consistency of these findings across multiple studies [ 3,4,16,36 - 39 ] and treatment modalities is encouraging .
our findings augment these prior results by demonstrating how the various prognostic factors interact .
high - level evidence supporting ablative therapy for limited metastatic patients is beginning to emerge .
a prospective randomized trial recently showed a progression - free survival benefit to consolidative radiation or surgery following systemic therapy for nsclc patients with three or fewer metastases [ 44 ] , and thermal ablation of colorectal liver metastases improved survival when given with chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone [ 45 ] .
furthermore , data suggest cost - effectiveness of ablative metastasis directed therapy in specific clinical scenarios [ 46 ] .
however , most patients still experience disease progression .
our data provide a useful and simple tool to aid practitioners in the selection of appropriate candidates for these increasingly implemented treatments [ 11,47 ] .
this study is limited by available data .
though a large , diverse , and multi - institutional cohort , patients in this cohort were selected for treatment , which might influence the overall results .
moreover , though the diversity of the cohort allows comparisons between a variety of patients and diseases , specific groups are therefore smaller .
application of the prognostic groups , while giving broad guidelines , may not reflect the complete intricacies within each group .
for instance , we are unable to capture differences between hormone sensitivity of prostate cancer or biomarker status of breast cancer patients within class 1 .
additionally , analyses beyond progression - free survival including freedom from systemic therapy was not available .
finally , the burden of disease in our study was based on number of metastases .
it is possible that volume of disease , while correlated , may offer additional value in assessing nevertheless , our study shows that long - term survivors exist and pre - treatment criteria may facilitate appropriate patient selection .
moreover , though statistical methods were used to attempt to maximize generalizability , our results should be validated on an external independent cohort to verify its applicability to the general population .
ongoing studies are necessary to assess the benefit of ablative therapy for oligometastases and identify biological factors that may further improve patient selection .
recent data suggest that a microrna candidate classifier can identify those more likely to survive after higrt [ 25 ] .
further analyses to expand on the biology of om patients are ongoing .
additionally , nrg - br001 ( nct02206334 ) is currently investigating recommended doses for multiple organ stereotactic ablative radiotherapy , and the randomized phase ii sabr - comet ( stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for comprehensive treatment of oligometastatic tumors ) has completed accrual ( nct01446744 ) [ 48,49 ] .
finally , given the strong prognostic weight our classifier places on primary tumor type and in particular breast cancer histology , our data validate the need to study ablative metastasis - directed therapy in this population , as is being done in nrg - br002 , randomizing women with 1 - 2 breast cancer metastases to upfront ablation of all metastases with either surgery or radiation along with standard of care systemic therapy or standard of care systemic therapy alone ( nct02364557 ) [ 50 ] .
conclusions in conclusion , in our large multi - institutional cohort , we found that following ablative radiotherapy for oligometastatic patients , long - term survivors exist and a sizable fraction do not progress .
we identified prognostic factors for patients undergoing higrt for oligometastases .
patients with breast , prostate , or kidney cancers or long disease - free intervals have promising outcomes overall .
bed was associated with improved clinical outcomes , and improved treated metastasis control was associated with overall survival .

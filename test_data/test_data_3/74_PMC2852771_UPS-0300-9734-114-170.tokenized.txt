objective the aims were to investigate the prevalence of depression among university students , and to determine some of the risk factors connected to depression , and also to evaluate its effect on health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) .
methods this cross - sectional survey was conducted between 1 december 2007 and 31 january 2008 at osmangazi university , eskisehir , in western turkey .
the study group consisted of 822 students .
the questionnaire included the students' socio - demographic characteristics , the beck depression inventory , and the medical outcomes study short form - 36 ( sf - 36 ) .
the data were analyzed by using chi - square , student 's t test , percent (%) ratios , and backward logistic regression analysis with a significant value of p < 0.05 .
results of the students , 377 ( 45.9 %) were males and 445 ( 54.1 %) females .
overall , the prevalence of depression was 21.8 % ( n = 179 / 822 ) .
family history of depression , acne on face , any physical defect on body , smoking , alcohol consumption , and future - related occupational preoccupation were all deemed important risk factors for depression ( p < 0.05 , for each one ) .
it was found that , in those with depression , all the mean domain scores of sf - 36 scale were lower than those without depression ( p < 0.05 , for each one ) .
conclusions the prevalence of depression among the university students in this region of turkey was wide - spread , affecting negatively the hrqol of the students .
for prevention and control of depression , depression information and knowledge need to be addressed by health education programs .
depression quality of life turkey university students introduction depression is a common mental disorder that presents with depressed mood , loss of interest or pleasure , feelings of guilt or low self - worth , disturbed sleep or appetite , low energy , poor concentration , and tendency to suicide , which can be seen in anybody regardless of age , gender , race , or socio - economic status ( 1 ) .
the period of youth is a time of contradictions when a person goes through many changes and experiences such as emotional , behavioral , sexual , economic , academic , and social , and as well as efforts of discovering one 's identity with psycho - social and sexual maturation .
during this period , the mental health of university youth constitutes one of the important components of social health ( 2 ) .
psychological problems such as depression have significant implications for students' lives , academic performance , and behavior .
students who reported experiencing at least one period of depression - like symptoms were significantly more likely to experience academic problems than were those without symptoms , in terms of receiving a lower grade ( 3 ) .
students reporting depression were significantly more likely to report less satisfaction with health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) than students not reporting depression symptoms .
poor class - room performance is proportional to the daily frequency of students' depression symptoms .
students who had depression symptoms have a significantly greater loss of healthy days compared to students who did not ( 4 ) .
the prevalence of depressive symptoms varies across different populations .
specially , depressive symptoms are frequent among university students all over the world and their prevalence appears to be increasing ( 5 ) .
the ' turkey mental health profile project ' reported that depression was among the most frequently seen mental illnesses ( 6 ) , and the prevalence of depressive symptoms in turkish university students varied between 10 % and 40 % ( 7,8 ) .
another study in the mid 1990s specified the prevalence rate at 34.5 % ( 9 ) , indicating an increase in depression among young adults in turkey in the second half of the 1990s .
we can speculate that changing environmental factors in the second half of the last decade negatively affected the psychological well - being of young people in turkey .
this article presents data from a study of the students of a state university in a province of western turkey , eskisehir .
the present cross - sectional study sought to address several areas of the subject : the depression status of turkish university students , the socio - demographic factors affecting prevalence , and the effect on hrqol .
methods development of the questionnaires and instrument the questionnaire consisted of three parts : in the first part of the questionnaire , the students were asked to state their demographic and medical characteristics .
the second part of the questionnaire evaluated the status and the prevalence of depression .
depression was measured with a turkish version of the beck depression inventory ( bdi ) ( 10 ) , which consists of 27 items .
the bdi was developed by beck et al. in 1961 ( 10 ) and later modified by hisli in 1999 to suit the turkish culture and norms ( 11 ) .
the answer for each item was evaluated as 0 , 1 , and 2 points .
the lowest number of points was accepted as ' 0 ' and the highest ' 54 ' , with a cut - off point of 19 .
the third part of the questionnaire included the medical outcomes study short form - 36 ( sf - 36 ) instrument , which was used to determine the hrqol of the students .
the original questionnaire was developed by ware and sherbourne in 1992 ( 12 ) , and its reliability and validity study for the turkish version was tested by kocyigit et al .
( 13 ) , who showed good reliability and validity of this instrument in the turkish validation study .
the subjects gave appropriate answers for the questions in the sf - 36 scale for their depression status during the last 4 weeks .
scores ranged from 0 to 100 for each domain separately .
participants eskisehir is a semi - rural province situated in the western part of turkey , with a population of about 705,000 .
at osmangazi university located in the province where the study was conducted , 8175 students were studying , and there were 6 schools ( medicine , engineering and architecture , science and literature , economics , education , and the college of health services ) .
participants were determined with a two - step sampling method .
in the first step , three schools were randomly selected , namely the schools of engineering and architecture , science and literature , and economics , the total student number of which was 6371 .
in the second step , at least one class from the first , second , third , and fourth years in each department were randomly selected to participate in this study .
the study was restricted to the 822 ( 80.8 %) accepting participants in the study , out of a total of 1018 students .
procedures following the completion of the questionnaires and inventories , each student 's body mass index ( bmi ) was measured with domestic scales and height with a meter rule , and bmi was calculated using the formula , bmi =( weight ( kg ))/( height ( m )) 2 .
those whose bmis were 25 kg / m2 and over were evaluated as overweight or obese ( 14 ) .
students were also examined for the existence of acne through physical inspection .
the permission for the study was obtained by making a petition prior to collecting data by contacting and receiving approval from the director of the institution of eskisehir osmangazi university .
participants were assured of the confidentiality of their responses and provided informed verbal consent .
statistics the statistical analysis was carried out using the student 's t test for continuous variables and the chi - square test for categorical variables .
significantly related variables were assessed in a model with logistic regression ( stepwise backward wald regression ) .
goodness - of - fit was calculated with the hosmer - lemeshow c statistic .

there were eight students with no siblings .
most students ( 34.4 %) reported staying with his / her house friends .
most students ( 36.6 %) declared studying at their preferred departments , followed by failing to qualify for other departments requiring higher scores ( 33.2 %) .
the prevalence of depression was significantly lower in those who were studying at their preferred departments ( 16.6 %) when compared to the other reasons of choice ( p < 0.05 ) .
it was reported that 57.4 % of the students had a future - related occupational preoccupation .
those students had significantly higher prevalence of depression when compared to those did not have such a preoccupation ( 25.2 % and 17.1 % , respectively ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
the average score that the students obtained from the bdi was 11.21 +/ - 8.56 , ranging from 0 to 51 .

discussion our results indicated that over one in five students ( 21.8 %) had depression .
some studies in our country have reported that the prevalence of depression for university students was found to be between 10.0 % and 40.0 % ( 15,16 ) , compatible with our study result .
in parallel , in some studies on university students conducted in several countries , the prevalence of depression was observed to be between 8.3 % and 45.0 % ( 5,17 ) .
the aforementioned studies show that the rate of depression in university students ranges from 8.0 % to 40.0 % .
while our result was higher than some study results , it was lower than others .
one explanation for these differences in reported depression rates could be the inconsistency in how questions were asked regarding time - frame .
a further possibility could be relevant to individuals' different socio - demographic characteristics .
in those who studied at their preferred schools , the prevalence of depression was significantly lower than in those who studied at their schools for other reasons ( p < 0.05 ) .
this status is an expected result since they achieved their aims .
in various studies , an important relationship was found between occupational preoccupation with the future and job choice , and the occurrence of depression ( 15 ) .
these results are in line with our study results in both bivariate analysis ( p < 0.05 ) and multivariate analysis ( or 1.690 ; 95 % ci 1.180 - 2.421 ) showing that there are important connections between occupational preoccupation and occurrence of depression ( p < 0.05 ) .
there is some evidence that nicotine has antidepressant properties , which may explain the relationship that depressed persons may self - medicate by smoking ( 18 ) .
in our study , in the smoker students , the prevalence of depression was found to be significantly higher than in those not smoking ( p < 0.05 ) .
many researchers support our study findings ( 5 ) .
one explanation for this could be that since the level of stress and anxiety in university students is rather high due to a stressful environment , a low allowance , and an intensive study tempo , they may have smoked more in line with the study showing that smokers with anxiety disorders reported greater anxiety sensitivity , anxiety symptoms , agoraphobic avoidance , depressed mood , negative affect , stress , and life interference , when compared to non - smokers ( 19 ) .
some evidence linking depression and alcohol abuse / dependence suggests that alcohol use and depression may be linked because persons who suffer from one disorder are prone to the other ( 20 ) .
these possibilities are compatible with our study result showing that the prevalence of depression was higher in the students consuming alcohol than in those who did not ( p < 0.05 ) .
similarly , logistic model results showed a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and depression ( or 1.435 ; 95 % ci 0.981 - 2.100 ) , consistent with some studies ( 5,21 ) .
because heavy alcohol use and daily smoking are each associated with depression , people who do both may be at an increased risk for depression .
this is a public health issue because people who drink alcohol often also smoke and vice versa .
in the current study , in the students with any chronic disease , the occurrence of depression was more than in those without ( p < 0.05 ) .
our finding is compatible with findings of a study ( 16 ) .
in that study , it was shown that disease inflicted a significant burden on the daily physical activities of the patients , as well as on their schooling and job opportunities .
in addition to these problems , these students were also insensitively teased by peers because of their typical features , and those diseases had their own consequences on the students' social behavior in that they were more introverted ( 16,22 ) .
in the present survey , in both bivariate and multivariate analyses , any physical defect that the students had was an important risk factor for the occurrence of depression ( p < 0.05 and or 2.043 ; 95 % ci 1.225 - 3.409 , respectively ) .
this may be explained by the finding that individuals having an obsessive preoccupation with an imagined appearance defect feel potential social rejection ( 23 ) .
in this study , in both bivariate and multivariate analyses , the students with acne on their face had a significantly higher risk for depression when compared to those who did not ( p < 0.05 and or 1.628 ; 95 % 1.149 - 2.309 , respectively ). by way of an explanation for this , it has been suggested that acne affects psycho - social health negatively due to the psychological issues attached to it , which include pain and discomfort , shame , body image , social assertiveness , obsessive - compulsiveness , embarrassment , and social inhibition .
furthermore , acne is also associated with a greater psychological burden than a variety of other disparate chronic disorders ( 24 ) .
in this study , the prevalence of depression in the students who had a family history of depression was significantly higher than in those without ( p < 0.05 ) .
similarly , the model showed the same significant connection ( or 1.649 ; 95 % 1.072 - 2.535 ) .
this may be explained with the genetic epidemiology data suggesting that younger age of onset is associated with family history of depression ( 25 ) .
this study found that in the students whose mothers had a job the prevalence of depression was higher than in those whose mothers did not ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas there was no connection between those whose fathers had a job and whose fathers did not have a job in terms of the prevalence of depression ( p > 0.05 ). whether parents have a job or not is a factor which directly affects the income level of family .
income level has a direct effect , both positive and negative , on social status and mental health of parents and children .
mothers who were employed , married , or both , reported better well - being than mothers who were both unemployed and unmarried , especially when their offspring had relatively higher adaptive functioning .
this relationship between role occupancy and well - being was fully mediated by socio - economic status ( ses ) .
sjoberg et al. reported that there was an important positive connection between depression and parents having job ( 26 ) .
in our study , it was found that the hrqol of students with depression was worse than for those without .
according to the sf - 36 scale , their hrqol was seen to have been affected negatively in all the domains ( p < 0.001 , for each domain ) .
similar results have been reported by many studies pointing out that hrqol of individuals with depression was affected in a negative way ( 27 ) .
in a study by gostautas et al. it was reported that the most frequently affected domain for those with depression was of physical functioning according to the sf - 36 scale ( 28 ) .
hayman et al. indicated that in those with depression the domains of physical functioning and mental health were affected in a negative way when compared to the other domains ( 23 ) .
one of the limitations of this study was that it was cross - sectional , thus precluding inferences of casualty among variables .
the second limitation is the self - reported nature of this study .
finally , the sample of the current study comprised a group of students in just one province of turkey , which may limit generalization of the results through the other students .
thus , in order to definitively answer this question university students , a large - sample study from different universities in the country needs to be conducted .
conclusion the prevalence of depression in university students was relatively high throughout our study , reaching almost one - fourth ( 21.8 %) .
this indicates that a need for knowledge concerning depression still exists and should be addressed by depression - related health education programs .

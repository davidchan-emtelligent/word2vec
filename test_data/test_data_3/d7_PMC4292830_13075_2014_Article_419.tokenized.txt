introduction activation of the inflammasome has been implicated in the pathology of various autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases .
while the nlrp3 inflammasome has been linked to arthritis progression , little is known about its synovial regulation or contribution to joint histopathology .
regulators of inflammation activation , such as interleukin ( il ) - 10 , may have the potential to limit the inflammasome - driven arthritic disease course and associated structural damage .
hence , we used il - 10 - deficient ( il - 10ko ) mice to assess nlrp3 inflammasome - driven arthritic pathology .
methods antigen - induced arthritis ( aia ) was established in il - 10ko mice and wild - type controls .
using histological and radiographic approaches together with quantitative real - time pcr of synovial mrna studies , we explored the regulation of inflammasome components .
these were combined with selective blocking agents and ex vivo investigative studies in osteoclast differentiation assays .
results in aia , il - 10ko mice display severe disease with increased histological and radiographic joint scores .
here , focal bone erosions were associated with increased tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( trap ) - positive cells and a localized expression of il - 1beta .
when compared to controls , il - 10ko synovium showed increased expression of il1b , il33 and nlrp3 inflammasome components .
synovial nlrp3 and casp1 expression further correlated with acp5 ( encoding trap ) , while neutralization of il - 10 receptor signaling in control mice caused increased expression of nlrp3 and casp1 .
in ex vivo osteoclast differentiation assays , addition of exogenous il - 10 or selective blockade of the nlrp3 inflammasome inhibited osteoclastogenesis .
conclusions these data provide a link between il - 10 , synovial regulation of the nlrp3 inflammasome and the degree of bone erosions observed in inflammatory arthritis .

issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 introduction as new biologics enter the clinical arena and advances in synovial histopathology identify divergent mechanisms of arthritis progression , it is essential to understand how the cytokine network governs the pattern of synovial inflammation [ 1,2 ] .
innate sensing mechanisms involving pattern recognition receptors are increasingly implicated in autoimmunity and promote cytokine responses associated with rheumatoid arthritis .
although these pathways represent promising therapeutic targets , further investigation is required to understand the expression and functional contribution of pattern recognition receptors in autoimmunity .
pattern recognition receptors were initially characterized as sensors of microbial products of bacterial , fungal or viral infection .
these include the toll - like receptors ( tlr ) ; nucleotide - binding domain and leucine - rich repeat containing receptors ( nlr ) , rig - i - like receptors ( rlr ) and c - type lectins [ 3,4 ] .
activation of these receptors promotes the inflammatory regulation of various interleukins , tumour necrosis family members and type - 1 interferons [ 3 ] .
they therefore represent innate sensing mechanisms , which shape the adaptive immune response to chronic disease , allergy , cancer and infection .
as a consequence , various processes have evolved to protect against the prolonged activation of these receptors .
for example , interleukin ( il ) - 10 limits the duration and intensity of their signaling in myeloid cells [ 5,6 ] .
here , il - 10 inhibits pattern recognition receptor signaling through mechanisms , which include downregulation of myd88 expression [ 7 ] , and the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of myd88 - dependent signaling molecules such as traf6 [ 8 ] .
in experimental models of inflammatory arthritis , il - 10 is protective and mice deficient in il - 10 show exacerbated joint inflammation [ 9,10 ] .
these data are consistent with the characterization of il - 10 as a cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor , which acts as an immunomodulatory cytokine affecting both innate and cellular immunity [ 11,12 ] .
for example , il - 10 inhibits nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kappab ) signaling in response to tlr agonists to block expression of certain proinflammatory mediators associated with arthritis progression .
interleukin - 10 is abundantly expressed in synovial fluids of ra patients and has been linked with the control of bone resorption through inhibition of osteoclastogenesis in vitro [ 13 - 15 ] .
while il - 10 is renowned for its ability to inhibit tlr signaling , its impact on innate sensing receptors , including the nlr family , is less documented .
here , caspase 1 activity is essential for the processing of cytokine precursors ( for example , pro - il - 1beta , pro - il - 18 and potentially pro - il - 33 ) into functionally active mature forms [ 16 ] .
activation of caspase 1 by the nlr family member nlrp3 , acting in association with its adaptor protein asc , leads to the secretion of il - 1beta and il - 18 [ 16 ] .
each of these cytokines affect arthritis progression [ 17,18 ] , which suggests that innate sensing complexes ( termed the inflammasome ) must be regulated during the course of disease .
various particulate and crystalline agonists activate the nlrp3 inflammasome .
for example , monosodium urate crystals and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals trigger arthritis symptoms in inflammatory forms of gout and pseudogout [ 19 - 21 ] , while basic calcium phosphate ( hydroxyapatite ) crystals are seen in 70 % of osteoarthritis ( oa ) cases [ 22,23 ] .
a role for the nlrp3 inflammasome in arthritic disease is illustrated by several in vitro studies , which show that crystals from the joints of oa patients and basic calcium phosphate crystals induce il - 1beta production by macrophages [ 24,25 ] .
also , a recent report shows that there is modulation of the nlrp3 inflammasome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ra patients and that single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in nlrp3 are associated with disease severity [ 26 ] .
however , little is known about the regulation and activation of inflammasome components in inflammatory arthritis .
we now show that the exacerbated joint pathology seen in il - 10ko mice during antigen - induced arthritis ( aia ) is associated with increased synovial expression of nlrp3 inflammasome components and a localized expression of il - 1beta at sites of focal bone erosions .
our data supports a role for il - 10 as a negative regulator of the inflammasome and highlights a role for the inflammasome in osteoclastogenesis during inflammatory arthritis .

values are expressed as a percentage of total immunoperoxidase staining .
osteoclast cell culture and trap stain bone marrow cells from femurs of wt and il - 10ko mice were re - suspended in alpha minimum essential medium ( alphamem ) supplemented with 10 % ( v : v ) foetal calf serum ( fcs ) and seeded at a density of 6.4 x 106 cells / ml in 24 - well plates .
following adhesion culture media was supplemented with macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( mcsf ) and receptor activator of nf - kappabeta ligand ( rankl ) .
il - 10 and inflammasome inhibitors were added as indicated in figure legends .
trap - positive cells were detected after seven days and total rna isolated from subsequent analysis .
quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) synovial membranes were dissected from the underpinning cartilage of knee joints [ 27 ] .
total rna was extracted from samples using tri reagent ( sigma - aldrich ) and cdna derived from 1 mug of total rna using a reverse transcription kit ( primer design , southampton , uk ) [ 27 ] .
gene expression analyses were performed on triplicate samples with sybr green ( invitrogen , thermo fisher scientific , carlsbad , ca , usa ) using an abi prism 7900ht instrument ( applied biosystems , thermo fisher scientific , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .

results il - 10ko mice display increased disease severity in experimental arthritis in line with an anti - inflammatory role for il - 10 in experimental arthritis , aia in il - 10ko mice caused increased joint swelling and an overall exacerbation of joint pathology as compared to wild - type ( wt ) controls ( figure 1a and b ) .
evaluation of synovial inflammation based on synovitis , cellular infiltrate , exudate and joint damage showed that histopathology was more prolonged in il - 10ko mice ( figure 1c ) .
thus , il - 10 acts to prevent long - term subclinical disease and the promotion of self - limiting synovitis .

il - 10ko , interleukin - 10 - deficient ; wt , wild - type .
il - 10 - deficiency is associated with loss of cartilage and increased bone erosion to determine the impact of joint inflammation on degenerative processes within the inflamed synovium , cartilage damage was based on a mankin 's score and quantified as a percentage loss of safranin - o staining ( figure 2a ) .
when compared to wt mice , cartilage depletion was more pronounced in il - 10ko mice at day 28 and 35 post arthritis induction ( figure 2a ) .
histology sections from il - 10ko mice also showed evidence of increased bone damage and sites of focal bone erosions .
while no significant difference in the quantification of synovial f4 / 80 staining was observed in synovial tissue for wt and il - 10ko mice , an increased localization of f4 / 80 staining was observed around sites of focal bone erosions in sections from aia - challenged il - 10ko mice ( figure 2b ) .
radiographic assessments of arthritic joints supported this finding and revealed a more pronounced loss of bone integrity in il - 10ko mice ( figure 2c ) .
to substantiate an involvement of il - 10 in bone turnover , the presence of trap - positive osteoclasts was detected ( figure 2d ) .
quantification of trap stain showed an increase in trap - positive cells in joint sections from il - 10ko mice ( figure 2d ) .
in accordance , elevated acp5 ( encoding trap ) gene expression was also observed in synovial mrna from il - 10ko mice ( figure 2d ) .
this was mirrored by a systemic increase in the surrogate bone erosion marker , dkk - 1 ( figure 2d ) .

focal bone erosions are associated with localized il - 1beta production to define the mechanisms governing bone damage in il - 10ko mice , we next considered the inflammatory environment of the inflamed synovium .
total mrna was extracted from the synovium of aia - challenged mice ( taken at day 3 post aia to reflect the initiation of disease ) and cytokine gene expression compared in il - 10ko and wt mice .
while il - 10ko mice showed no substantive alteration in synovial il6 or tnf over 28 days , there was a twofold increase in il1b over that seen in wt mice three days after arthritis induction , which had resolved by day 28 ( figure 3a ) .
increased synovial il - 1beta expression was also observed by immunohistochemistry ( figure 3b ) .
interleukin - 1beta protein staining was most prominent in joint sections from il - 10ko mice at day 28 post aia and coincided with the observed elevation in bone erosion .
in this regard , il - 1beta staining co - localized to areas of focal bone erosion ( figure 3c ) .
other il - 1 family members , including il - 18 and il - 33 have also been linked with bone turnover [ 28,29 ] .
synovial mrna from aia - challenged il - 10ko mice showed no change in il18 expression , but a 3.5 - fold increase in il33 as compared to wt controls ( figure 3d ) .
these data highlight a specific role of il - 1 family members in the destructive processes of inflammatory arthritis .
figure 3 augmented il - 1beta in the il - 10ko mice following antigen - induced arthritis ( aia ) .
( a ) expression of inflammatory cytokines ; il6 , tnf and il1b were examined in the synovial mrna of wt ( closed circles ) and il - 10ko ( open circles ) mice 3 and 28 days after aia induction and made relative to the values for 18s ribosomal rna ( n = 4 - 7 , * p < 0.05 ) .

il - 10ko , interleukin - 10 - deficient ; wt , wild - type .
il - 10 regulates inflammasome expression within the inflamed synovium activation of the inflammasome is required for the generation of active il - 1beta .
we therefore examined the synovial regulation of inflammasome components by il - 10 during arthritis .
at day 3 post aia induction , synovial nlrp3 , aim2 , casp1 and casp12 were all significantly elevated ( approximately two - to threefold ) in il - 10ko mice when compared to wt controls ( figure 4a ) .
in contrast , nlrp1 , asc , rigi , nod1 and nod2 remained largely unaltered from wt mice ( figure 4a ) .
to verify a link between il - 10 and synovial inflammasome expression , wt mice were administered ( i.a. ) with a blocking anti - il - 10r antibody at the onset of aia ( figure 4b ) .
when compared to isotype or vehicle - control treatments , inhibition of il - 10r signaling promoted a three - to fourfold increase in synovial nlrp3 , casp1 and casp12 , while aim2 showed a trend towards significance ( figure 4b ) .
thus , confirming a link between il - 10 and regulation of the nlrp3 inflammasome within the inflamed synovium .

( a ) expression of inflammasome components ; nlrp3 , aim2 , casp1 , casp12 , nlrp1 , asc , rigi , nod1 and nod2 were examined in synovial mrna of wt ( closed circles ) and il - 10ko ( open circles ) mice three days after aia induction .

il - 10ko , interleukin - 10 - deficient ; wt , wild - type .
regulation of osteoclastogenesis by il - 10 and the inflammasome we next sought to provide a link between arthritic bone erosions and the regulation of the inflammasome .
quantitative pcr revealed a positive correlation between acp5 and nlrp3 ( r = 0.8173 ) and casp1 ( r = 0.47 ) in samples from il - 10ko mice ( figure 5a ) .
we therefore considered the involvement of il - 10 and the nlrp3 in an in vitro mcsf / rankl - driven osteoclast differentiation assay .
consistent with previous studies [ 13,15 ] , il - 10 blocked osteoclast differentiation by approximately twofold ( figure 5b ) .
under these conditions , il - 10 inhibited acp5 and ctsk ( cathepsin - k , which contributes to osteoclast - mediated bone resorption ) expression ( figure 5b ) .
to assess the role of the inflammasome in this process , osteoclast formation was monitored in the present of cytokine release inhibitory drug - 3 ( crid3 ) or glibenclamide .
crid3 inhibits nlrp3 and aim2 by blocking asc oligomers and the activation of caspase 1 [ 30 ] , while glibenclamide is an atp - sensitive potassium channel inhibitor that prevents maturation of caspase 1 and pro - il - 1beta through nlrp3 [ 31 ] .
using myeloid progenitors from il - 10ko mice , addition of crid3 or glibenclamide significantly reduced osteoclast numbers and blocked generation of trap - positive cells ( figure 5c ) .
these data support a role for nlrp3 in governing bone turnover and erosion .

discussion innate sensing mechanisms were traditionally linked with the recognition of bacterial , fungal and viral infections .
this viewpoint has , however , changed and many act as sensors of both endogenous and exogenous danger signals [ 32 - 34 ] .
members of the nlr family are intrinsic to caspase - activating complexes termed the inflammasome .
these receptors recognize certain infectious pathogens , particles ( for example , microcrystals ) , metabolic anomalies ( for example , hyperglycaemia , atp ) and chemicals , and contribute to the pathology of various autoinflammatory diseases [ 32 ] .
this has led to the novel application of drugs that target il - 1beta ( for example , anakinra , canakinumab and rilonacept ) in conditions such as periodic fever syndromes , still 's disease , schnitzler 's syndrome , and gouty arthritis where conventional anti - inflammatory drugs fail to provide long - lasting relief [ 35 ] .
here , we show that il - 10 negatively regulates the expression of nlrp3 inflammasome components within the inflamed synovium of experimental arthritis and provide a link to degenerative bone erosion .
several lines of evidence support an involvement of the inflammasome in inflammatory and degenerative arthritis .
while nlrp3 is expressed in ra and oa synovium [ 36,37 ] it is difficult to comment on the functional significance of these findings as quantification of transcript levels provide minimal information on inflammasome activity .
an involvement of the inflammasome in joint pathology is illustrated by studies of calcium crystals , which accumulate through biomechanical stress or altered mechanisms of calcification .
here , the ectopic deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in synovial fluids from osteoarthritis patients is associated with disease progression [ 38 ] .
hydroxyapatite crystals activate the nlrp3 inflammasome to promote il - 1beta and il - 18 release by lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) - primed macrophages [ 24 ] .
studies in an air pouch model of synovitis also confirmed the activation of nlrp3 / asc / caspase 1 by hydroxyapatite crystals and supported a role in controlling neutrophil infiltration [ 24 ] .
analysis of synovial inflammation in aia - challenged asc - ko mice showed reduced disease severity [ 39 ] .
this response was not , however , seen in nlrp3 - ko and caspase1 - ko mice , where both genotypes showed similar pathology to that observed in wt controls [ 39 ] .
these results are consistent with our own , where we see similar disease pathology between the wt and il - 10ko mice at these early time points .
we now show that at the later stages of inflammatory arthritis , in the absence of il - 10 , joint inflammation results in a temporal increase in synovial il - 1beta , which corresponds with enhanced pathology and co - localization to areas rich in f4 / 80 - postive cells that cluster at sites of focal bone erosion .
such changes in il - 1beta may reflect the capacity of il - 10 to inhibit tlr control of il1beta ( pro - il - 1beta ) and the expression of nlrp3 inflammasome components .
at this stage we are , however , unable to ascertain what inflammatory events ( for example , tlr or cytokine - driven outcomes ) regulate the induction of these inflammasome genes .
our results implicate the involvement of the inflammasome in osteoclastogenesis , with il - 10 deficiency causing an increase in both synovial il - 1beta and il - 33 expression , but not il - 18 .
interleukin - 1beta is considered pro - osteoclastogenic and drives an imbalance in chondrocyte responses through regulation of prostanoids , nitric oxide and other free radicals , and the induction of degradative enzymes that impact collagen and proteoglycan turnover [ 40,41 ] .
in contrast , il - 33 and il - 18 are considered anti - osteoclastogenic and protect against tumour necrosis factor alpha ( tnfalpha ) - mediated bone loss [ 42,43 ] .
thus , il - 33 often opposes the activities of il - 1beta , which raises a question about the regulation of these cytokines by the nlrp3 / caspase 1 system .
while pro - il - 1beta and pro - il - 18 are processed by caspase 1 into mature active forms , full - length il - 33 is already biologically active and is released as a consequence of cell damage [ 44 ] .
further processing by caspase 1 causes inactivation of il - 33 [ 44,45 ] .
il - 33 is also modified by the activity of elastase and cathepsin g , which are secreted by infiltrating neutrophils and enhance il - 33 bioactivity [ 46 ] .
here , il - 33 acts as an endogenous danger signal ( alarmin ) , which alerts innate immune cells to sites of infection or injury .
thus , the elevated expression of il33 in il - 10ko mice may simply reflect the overall increase in synovial inflammation .
moreover , the blockade of osteoclastogenesis by crid3 and glibenclamide suggests a role for caspase 1 in bone turnover .
targeting the inflammasome may therefore benefit joint pathologies allied with il - 1beta production , such as oa , muckle - wells syndrome ( an autoinflammatory disorder linked with mutations in nlrp3 ) and gout [ 20,35,47,48 ] .
such an approach may provide an added benefit over traditional biologic interventions including anakinra , which in clinical trials of oa offered no improvement in symptoms [ 49 ] .
to provide preclinical evidence to support this notion , attempts were made to treat aia - challenged il - 10ko mice ( i.a. ) with either crid3 or glibenclamide .
however , administration ( i.a. ) of vehicle alone as a control promoted a robust inflammatory response , which prevented the direct investigation of this in vivo .
our results indicate that il - 10 has the capacity to inhibit expression of nlrp3 and certain components of the inflammasome .
here , neutralization of il - 10 receptor signaling in wt mice enhanced synovial nlrp3 and casp1 expression and addition of endogenous il - 10 inhibited the formation of trap + osteoclasts in vitro .
significantly , human trials with recombinant il - 10 showed no improvement in disease activity [ 50 ] , while il - 10 responses in synovial macrophages from ra patients appear dysregulated [ 51 ] .
such alterations in il - 10 responsiveness results in a loss of its anti - inflammatory properties and a concomitant acquisition of interferon - gamma ( ifngamma ) - like activities [ 51 ] .
conclusions our studies implicate a link between il - 10 and expression of the nlrp3 inflammasome within the inflamed synovium , and advocate a role for il - 10 and inflammasome activation in governing osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion. with advances in synovial histopathology taking centre stage in clinical practice [ 2 ] , monitoring il - 10 or inflammasome activities within the inflamed joints of patients with early ra may prove valuable as a predictor of disease activity or bone erosions , and may help tailor the design of novel treatments for defined patient groups .

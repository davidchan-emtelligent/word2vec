dear editor , we read with interest the case report linking phrynoderma and night blindness by murthy et al. [ 1 ] the authors have done well to document the coexistence. [ 1 ] we would like to share our experience with a similar case .
a 15 - year - old girl presented with history of anorexia , generalized fatigue , decreased night vision and skin lesions .
she had been ill for around 6 months and had previously received a blood transfusion elsewhere .
she denied any history of fever or any other chronic illness .
she was pale and had hyperpigmented knuckles [ fig. 1 ] .
the patient had a papular skin rash suggestive of toad skin on her elbows and abdomen [ fig. 2 ] .
sclera had a lemony tinge .
the conjunctiva appeared dry but there was no evidence of any bitot spots or corneal lesion .
palpation of abdomen revealed an enlarged liver and spleen .
the hemogram was suggestive of macrocytic anemia ( hemoglobin 7.2 g / dl , total leukocyte count 3200 / mul , platelets 88,000 / mul , mean corpuscular volume 102 fl ) .
peripheral smear revealed macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils .
serum vitamin b - 12 levels were reduced to 112 pg / ml ( normal range : 279 - 996 pg / ml ) .
folate levels were also reduced to 2 ng / ml ( normal range : 5.4 - 18.0 ng / ml ) .
bone marrow examination was consistent with the diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia .
liver functions revealed slightly elevated serum bilirubin ( 3.2 mg / dl ) with normal enzymes and serum albumin .
the patient was put on replacement with cobalamin , folic acid and vitamin a. the anemia and the skin lesions resolved over 6 months of follow - up. figure 1 hperpigmented knuckles figure 2 toad - like skin over trunk we present this case for two reasons .
first , the case demonstrates coexistence of phrynoderma and decreased nocturnal vision .
also , the coexistence of features of vitamin a , folate and b12 deficiency existed in this case .
it is important because of coexistence of both water and fat soluble vitamin deficiency .
it may be noted that current belief is that multiple nutrient deficiencies coexist to result in phrynoderma. [ 2 ] it is therefore of importance that patients with phrynoderma be evaluated not just for vitamin a deficiency but also for deficiency of vitamins b , c and e .

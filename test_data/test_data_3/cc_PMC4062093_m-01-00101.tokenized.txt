purple acid phosphatase diphosphonucleotide phosphatase phosphodiesterase ppd1 bimetallic fe - mn fibronectin type iii domain crystal structure saxs 1 .
introduction purple acid phosphatases ( paps ; ec 3.1.3.2 ) catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic phosphorus from a broad range of phosphate monoesters and anhydrides in the ph range 4 - 7 ( olczak et al. , 2003 >) .
the enzymes function in the production , transport and recycling of inorganic phosphorus , which is crucial for cellular metabolism and bioenergetics , as well as in bacterial killing , since they are able to generate reactive oxygen species via fenton chemistry .
paps are acidic metallohydrolases with the metal centre comprising an iron ( iii ) ion and a divalent metal , which is either a zinc ( ii ) , manganese ( ii ) or iron ( ii ) ion .
the active site comprises a characteristic set of seven highly conserved amino - acid residues binding to the dinuclear metal centre .
the iron ( iii ) ion coordinates to tyrosine , histidine and aspartate residues and a hydroxo / aqua ligand , while the divalent metal coordinates to two histidine residues , an asparagine and a terminal aqua ligand ; an aspartate residue bridges the two metal ions ( schenk et al. , 2005 > , 2008 > ; boudalis et al. , 2007 > ; klabunde et al. , 1995 >) .
eukaryotic paps have been classified into two main groups : high - molecular - weight (~ 55 kda ) and low - molecular - weight (~ 35 kda ) enzymes ( flanagan et al. , 2006 >) .
multiple pap - like isoforms have been identified in the genomes of arabidopsis thaliana ( schenk , guddat et al. , 2000 >) , sweet potato ( schenk et al. , 1999 > ; durmus et al. , 1999 >) , tomato ( bozzo et al. , 2002 >) , soybean ( schenk et al. , 1999 >) , red kidney bean ( schenk et al. , 1999 >) and potato ( zimmermann et al. , 2004 >) and in prokary - otic genomes ( schenk , korsinczky et al. , 2000 >) .
the best characterized enzymes among plant paps are the fe - - zn phosphatase purified from red kidney bean ( phaseolus vulgaris ; klabunde et al. , 1995 > , 1996 > ; strater et al. , 1995 >) and the fe - mn - containing sweet potato pap , which has an increased catalytic activity for phosphate esters and has been shown to require manganese ( ii ) ( schenk et al. , 2005 >) .
recently , we identified , purified and characterized a diphosphonucleotide phosphatase / phosphodiesterase ( ppd1 ) from yellow lupin ( lupinus luteus ) seeds , which belongs to a novel group of high - molecular - weight ( 75 kda ) plant paps with one fe atom and one mn atom ( 1:1 molar ratio ) per subunit ( olczak et al. , 2000 > , 2009 > ; olczak & watorek , 2000 > ; olczak & olczak , 2005 >) .
the enzyme is a glycoprotein , possessing paucimannosidic , high - mannose and complex - type oligosaccharides ( olczak et al. , 2000 >) .
among the complex - type n - - glycans , lewis epitope structures have been found which are characteristic of extracellular plant proteins .
however , the presence of paucinomannosidic n - glycans might suggest vacuolar location of ppd1 .
unlike typical paps , ppd1 cleaves the pyrophosphate bond in diphosphonucleotides and the phosphodiester bond in various phosphodiesters , and has a high affinity towards the diphosphate bond in organic and inorganic pyrophosphates , with the highest specificity towards diphosphonucleotides ( olczak et al. , 2000 >) .
its substrate specificity is similar to that of nucleotide pyrophosphatase / phosphodiesterase from soybean leaves ( salvucci & crafts - brandner , 1995 >) , with the exception of its low affinity towards nucleotide - sugars ( gdp - glucose and udp - glucose ) .
ppd1 cleaves the pyrophosphate bond but differs from plant soluble pyrophosphatases in its preference to act at slightly acidic ph. here , we report the solution and single - crystal x - ray structures of ppd1 for the first time , revealing that it possesses an immunoglobulin fold in the n - terminal domain and functions as a homohexamer , features that are both unique among paps characterized to date .
2. methods and materials 2.1 .
purification of ppd1 the purification of native ppd1 from yellow lupin seeds and determination of its enzymatic activity were performed as described previously ( olczak & watorek , 1998 > ; olczak et al. , 2009 >) .
2.2 .
analysis of dnase activity the ability of ppd1 to cleave dna was examined by following the digestion of plasmid dna and linear lambda dna .
digestion products were separated using agarose - gel electrophoresis .
circular plasmid dna ( p3xflag - cmv - 26 ; sigma ) at a concentration of 22 ng microl - 1 in 20 mm mes buffer ph 6.0 containing 0.2 m nacl and 0.1 % triton x - 100 was treated with ppd1 ( 50 ng microl - 1 ) at 37degreesc .
subsequently , 20 microl aliquots were removed and reaction was stopped by heating at 90degreesc for 10 min .
a similar procedure was employed for linear high - molecular - weight lambda dna ( sigma ) , with the exception that dna was used at a concentration of 20 ng microl - 1 and ppd1 at a concentration of 100 ng microl - 1 .
samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 1 % or 0.6 % agarose gels containing ethidium bromide in 1x tae buffer at 100 v for approximately 1 h. the resulting gels were visualized using the geldoc documentation system ( bio - rad ) .
a tube test for dnase activity was performed according to kunitz ( 1950 >) with modifications .
briefly , the reaction was carried out continuously at 25degreesc in 1.2 ml 0.1 m acetate buffer ph 5.0 containing 0.85 % nacl and 10 mm mgso4 , using 0.0033 % dna from calf thymus ( sigma ) , and the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm was measured ( beckman du - 640 ) .
standardized dnase i from bovine pancreas ( 4000 kunitz units per milligram ; sigma ) was used as a control .
samples were analyzed in triplicate .
dnase - free chemicals and sterile water were used in all experiments .
2.3 .
crystallization crystals were grown using the hanging - drop method at room temperature by equilibration of 2 microl 5 mg ml - 1 ppd1 solution in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer , 0.5 m nacl at ph 5.2 with 2 microl ready - made solution no .
39 ( box 1 ) from the morpheus screen ( molecular dimensions ) over 100 microl of the same morpheus reservoir solution .
solution 39 / 1 consists of 0.12 m alcohols mix ( equal composition of 1 - butanol , 2 - - propanol , 1,3 - propanediol , 1,2 - propanediol , 1,4 - butanediol and 1,6 - hexanediol ) , 0.1 m buffer system 1 ( 1 m mes and 1 m imidazole ) at ph 6.5 and 30 % precipitant comprising 40 % glycerol and 20 % peg 4000 .
crystals were cryocooled in reservoir solution and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection .
2.4 .
x - ray data collection , processing and structure determination this is described in full in the supporting information .
the proxima1 beamline at soleil equipped with an adsc q315 3 x 3 ccd detector was used to collect the crystallo - graphic data from ppd1 single crystals .
the small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) data for ppd1 in solution ( 1 - 4 mg ml - 1 concentration ) were collected using the swing beamline at soleil .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
overall structure of ppd1 previously , we had predicted a three - dimensional model from the ppd1 sequence using the structure of sweet potato pap ( pdb entry 1xzw ) as a template ( olczak et al. , 2009 >) .
this model included only the sequence 158 - 602 of ppd1 , i.e its n - - terminal sequence was omitted .
the crystal structure reported here confirms the accuracy of the predicted homology model for this segment of the protein .
the overall structure of the ppd1 subunit is defined by two domains : a sweet potato - like pap domain , containing the fe - mn active site , and a previously uncharacterized n - terminal domain with unknown function .
the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains three identical subunits ( polypeptide chains a , b and c ) , which together form a homotrimer ( fig. 1 > a ) .
five disulfide bridges are present within each subunit , three of which are involved in positioning the structural elements that form the trimer interfaces .
there are no intersubunit disulfides involved in forming the ppd1 trimer or hexamer .
a possible 22 hydrogen bonds and eight salt bridges between each of the adjacent subunits help to stabilize the trimeric assembly , with 7 % of the solvent - accessible surface area buried at each intersubunit interface .
the solvent - accessible c - terminal end of each subunit ( residues 583 - 589 ) is oriented by the cys577 - cys582 bridge so that it traverses the adjoining subunit , protruding into its fe - mn active site and placing the side chain of the terminal ser589 within 8 a of the two metal atoms .
the n - terminal region ( residues 1 - 150 ) is longer than in other paps and has very low sequence homology to target protein sequences in uniprot and other protein - sequence databases , yielding no identifiable or conserved domains .
however , the remainder of the ppd1 structure up to the c - terminal end has 24 % sequence identity to sweet potato pap ( olczak et al. , 2009 >) and is structurally very similar , with an r.m.s.d. of 1.58 a when aligned using ssm superposition ( krissinel & henrick , 2004a > ; fig. 1 > b ) .
there are no disulfides in the sweet potato pap subunit , but its biological dimer is linked by an intersubunit disulfide bridge ( there is no equivalent subunit interface bridge in ppd1 ) located on extended loops .
the equivalent loops in each ppd1 subunit are forced by a disulfide bridge ( cys484 - cys491 ; fig. 1 > a ) to adopt a different orientation to that in sweet potato pap .
this structural constraint in ppd1 serves to create space for the c - - terminal end of one subunit to contact the active site of the adjacent subunit , as described above .
3.2 .
the oligomeric state and biological unit of ppd1 unlike mammalian paps , which function as monomers , the plant enzymes have been described as homodimeric glycoproteins with a molecular weight of ~ 110 kda .
our previously published data on native and recombinant ppd1 shows that while the glycosylation state influences protein migration during gel - filtration chromatography , there is clear evidence for purified ppd1 forming higher oligomers ( olczak et al. , 2000 > ; olczak & olczak , 2005 >) .
analysis of the crystal structure of ppd1 using the pdbepisa server ( krissinel & henrick , 2007 >) suggests that its most probable quartenary structure is a hexamer , with an estimated dissociation free energy of 42 kcal mol - 1 compared with 24 kcal mol - 1 for the trimer .
the hexamer generated from crystallographic symmetry ( fig. 1 > c ) possesses a trimer - trimer interface that includes 36 hydrogen bonds ( 12 symmetry - related hydrogen bonds per subunit - subunit interaction ) and which buries 12 % of the solvent - accessible surface area .
the trimers are rotated by approximately 60degrees with respect to each other , giving a staggered appearance to the n - terminal domains when viewed along the threefold axis .
the stabilizing trimer - trimer hydrogen bonds are all contained at the interfaces between the active sites , which are separated by 38 a and are fully solvent - exposed ( fig. 1 > d ) .
a sugar molecule is also bound to each subunit at this region of the interface , to asn525 .
the symmetry of the hexamer entails that the c - terminal loops of adjacent subunits from each trimer are extended into the solvent channel and separated from each other by approximately 8 - 10 a across the trimer - trimer interface .
the concentration of hydrogen bonds at the interface between the two active sites , along with the positioning of the c - terminal ends in the hexamer and their extension into the active sites in each trimer to within 8 a of the metals , argue that these structural elements are involved in allosteric regulation of the catalytic activity .
experimental confirmation of the hexameric form of ppd1 in the solution state was obtained by saxs ( small - angle x - ray scattering ) measurements ( fig. 2 > a ) .
the radius of gyration , r g , calculated from the guinier region of the saxs data is 49.8 +/ - 0.1 a. the r g calculated from the crystal structure for the trimer is 37 a , while the r g calculated from the crystallo - graphic symmetry hexamer is 46 a. a fit of the crystallo - graphic hexamer to the saxs spectrum using crysol ( svergun et al. , 1995 >) gives a chi of 2.5 compared with 51 for the trimer model .
in these calculations , the contribution to the scattering from the covalently bound sugars was not taken into account .
shape reconstructions from the solution saxs data ( fig. 2 > b and supplementary fig. s1 ) are consistent with the crystallographic hexamer , providing convincing evidence that this is the genuine oligomeric state of ppd1 and is not the result of crystal packing .
a homohexameric quaternary structure is unique for a pap , since previously only homodimers have been reported for the plant enzymes .
among similar enzymes which do function as hexamers are the soluble pyrophosphatases ( ppases ) , which hydrolyse inorganic pyrophosphate to two orthophosphates .
all soluble ppases are homo - oligomers : dimers in eukaryotes and hexamers or tetramers in prokayotes .
the best characterized ppases are those from escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae ( cooperman et al. , 1992 > ; baykov et al. , 1999 >) .
the biological unit of e. coli ppase is formed by six identical subunits of 20 kda each arranged with d 3 symmetry in two layers of trimers ( i.e. a dimer of two trimers ; kankare et al. , 1996 > ; harutyunyan et al. , 1997 >) .
however , ppd1 and the ppases are different in their activities and show no sequence and structural homology .
3.3 .
the fe - mn active site paps from different sources , including ppd1 , show a high degree of conservation among the residues present in the catalytic centre ( klabunde et al. , 1995 > ; guddat et al. , 1999 > ; lindqvist et al. , 1999 > ; uppenberg et al. , 1999 > ; schenk et al. , 2005 > ; strater et al. , 2005 >) .
previously , we identified an fe - mn bimetallic centre in ppd1 , examined its oxidation state and demonstrated that it requires iron and divalent metal for its enzymatic activity ( olczak et al. , 2009 >) .
the crystal structure shows the active site of ppd1 with a phosphate ion bound to both of the metal atoms , similar to that previously described to be unique for sweet potato pap ( schenk et al. , 2005 >) .
anomalous scattering peaks confirm the identities of the metals at the active site ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
the coordination environment of the metals is identical in each of the three subunits of the trimer .
the fe atom is coordinated by protein residues his478 , tyr315 , asp271 and asp312 , which bridges the two metal atoms ( fig. 3 > a ) .
the mn atom is coordinated by his434 , his476 , asn345 and the bridging asp312 .
one o atom of the bound phosphate anion acts as a bridge between the two metal ions , and two more o atoms from the phosphate group complete the coordination spheres of both metals .
although the exact process is still under debate , a general model of the catalytic mechanism of paps has been reported by several investigators .
the detailed description has mainly been based on the crystal structures of free red kidney bean pap and its complexes with phosphate ( which is both a reaction product and a substrate analogue ) and tungstate ( an inhibitor ) ( strater et al. , 2005 > ; klabunde et al. , 1996 >) , and on the structure of the phosphate - bound sweet potato pap ( schenk et al. , 2005 >) .
the structures of red kidney bean pap with bound sulfate and fluoride provided further insights into the pre - catalytic phase of the enzymatic reaction ( schenk et al. , 2008 >) , from which an eight - step model for the reaction mechanism was proposed .
briefly , in the initial step of the catalytic cycle the phosphate group is bound to the divalent metal ion , displacing a water molecule ( schenk et al. , 2008 > ; twitchett et al. , 2002 >) .
the substrate is then oriented and activated by this centre to facilitate nucleophilic attack by a hydroxide group ( boudalis et al. , 2007 > ; schenk et al. , 2005 > , 2008 > ; smoukov et al. , 2002 >) .
the iron ( iii ) - bound hydroxide group can attack the electrophilic atom of the substrate , initiating ester - bond hydrolysis ( klabunde et al. , 1996 > ; lindqvist et al. , 1999 > ; schenk et al. , 2008 > ; uppenberg et al. , 1999 > ; merkx et al. , 1999 >) .
a mechanism in which the mu - hydroxide bridge acts as the nucleophile for hydrolysis of the phosphate has been also proposed ( schenk et al. , 2008 > ; smoukov et al. , 2002 >) .
after hydrolysis of the substrate , the phosphate is bound to the pap metal centre ( guddat et al. , 1999 > ; schenk et al. , 2005 >) .
while the active - site structure of ppd1 fits into this general scheme , the physiological roles and specific substrates of different paps still have to be determined and modifications to this mechanism are anticipated .
while the majority of paps do not exhibit the ability to hydrolyze diesters , based on their lack of activity with bis ( p - nitrophenyl ) phosphate ( bis - pnpp ) , ppd1 does hydrolyse diesters ( olczak et al. , 2000 > ; olczak & olczak , 2002 >) , behaviour that is similar to model complexes designed to mimic the pap metal centre ( olczak & watorek , 1998 > ; xavier et al. , 2009 >) .
this difference in substrate selectivity and reactivity of the enzymes probably results from the amount of steric crowding ( cox et al. , 2007 >) and degree of hydrophobicity of the active sites .
this is indicated , for example , by comparison between the sweet potato pap and ppd1 active sites , which shows that the bimetallic site in the latter is more accessible and open and contains more hydrophobic residues ( fig. 3 > b ) .
in sweet potato pap , substrate orientation , specificity and transition - state activation involve residues his295 and glu365 , both of which form a hydrogen bond to the uncoordinated o atom of the phosphate anion ( schenk et al. , 2005 >) .
in ppd1 , both of these residues are substituted positionally by phe residues , which are located ~ 5 a further away from the binding site of the phosphate anion .
the phosphate o atom is instead hydrogen - bonded to one of several water molecules that occupy the vacant space left by the larger active - site cavity .
a different catalytic model and an alternative substrate are required for ppd1 compared with sweet potato pap , and further investigation is needed to clarify these details .
3.4 .
n - terminal domain structure and topology genes encoding paps have been found in mammalian , plant , mycobacterial and fungal genomes , but the phylogeny of paps is still a matter of debate .
it has been speculated that the catalytic domains of paps may have evolved through the combination of mononuclear centres ( guddat et al. , 1999 >) .
however , the origin of the noncatalytic n - terminal domain present in some paps remains unknown and does not preclude a convergent type of evolution .
structural evidence for the flexibility of the entire n - terminal end of the protein is provided by its higher average calpha - atom b factor ( 26 a2 ) compared with the pap domain ( 18 a2 ) and by the presence of two main - chain conformations , comprising 120 residues of the domain , that are clearly traceable in the electron - density maps of one of the three subunits of each trimer ( fig. 4 > a ) .
a normal - mode analysis of the hexamer , performed using the nomad - ref server ( lindahl et al. , 2006 >) , shows that the first six nontrivial low - frequency modes are dominated by the movement of this domain relative to the pap domain , which remains relatively fixed ( fig. 4 > b ) .
since the n - terminal domain ' overhangs' the pap domain , with its extended loop fluctuating in the solvent channel of the active site during these movements , such structural transitions may have a functional importance during catalysis .
the n - terminal domain ( residues 1 - 150 ) of ppd1 consists primarily of two beta - sheets making up a seven - stranded beta - - barrel .
a 26 - residue loop ( phe59 - pro85 ) joining beta - strands 3 and 4 extends about 20 a from the barrel and into the active - site solvent channel of the pap domain .
this extension positions the lys74 side chain on the loop 10 a from the phosphate - binding site and 8 a from the ser589 residue of the neighbouring subunit .
the loop is stabilized by a cys69 - cys82 disulfide bridge and a pro78 - cis - pro79 - phe80 motif , with a pi - - stacking interaction between pro78 and phe80 and additional pi - stacking between phe59 and phe64 ( fig. 5 > a ) .
structural homologues of the n - terminal domain were found by searching the pdb using the ssm ( pdbefold ) server ( krissinel & henrick , 2004b >) .
the top hits , all with z - - scores of < 6 and q - scores of < 0.3 , were found for proteins containing s - type or v - type immunoglobulin - like folds .
these included the fibronectin type iii ( fn3 ) domain of human sidekick - 2 , the dna - binding antitumour antibiotic chromoprotein c - 1027 ( tanaka et al. , 2001 >) and the human t - cell surface glycoprotein cd8 alpha chain ( gao et al. , 1997 >) .
the seven - stranded beta - barrel arrangement of ppd1 is consistent with an s - type immunoglobulin fold ( bork et al. , 1994 > ; fig. 5 > b ) .
however , the ppd1 structure lacks the strongly conserved disulfide bridge and tryptophan residue characteristically found at the core of the beta - barrel ( ioerger et al. , 1999 >) .
the structural similarity of the n - terminal domain of ppd1 to the apo form of the antitumour antibiotic protein c - 1027 and related chromoproteins ( e.g. neocarzinostatin and kedarcidin ) is intriguing in view of their dna - cleaving properties when complexed with enediyne chromophores .
c - 1027 has a v - type immunoglobulin fold and gave the best overall score for the structural alignment with ppd1 .
the two hairpin beta - - strands in the v - type topology are replaced in ppd1 by a short loop connecting beta - strands 5 and 6 ( fig. 5 > c ) .
the largest structural difference between these proteins and ppd1 , and excluded from the ssm alignment , is the much shorter loop ( 7 - 10 residues compared with 26 residues in ppd1 ) connecting beta - - strands 3 and 4 .
the enediyne chromophore - binding site is located here in the c - 1027 holoenzyme and is thought to be the site where its interaction with dna occurs ( tanaka et al. , 2001 >) .
fn3 domains are most common in animal proteins , having a number of important functions , including cell - surface adhesion , cell migration , blood coagulation and signalling , and they bind to a range of other molecules including dna , heparin and collagen .
fn3 domains have also been observed in a restricted set of extracellular enzymes found among a diverse set of soil bacteria ( bork & doolittle , 1992 > ; hansen , 1992 > ; little et al. , 1994 >) .
in plant proteins , an fn3 type domain was first identified in the sequence of red kidney bean pap through hidden markov modelling ( tsyguelnaia & doolittle , 1998 >) and was confirmed by the crystal structure ( strater et al. , 1995 >) .
this structural motif is present in other paps , including ppd1 and sweet potato pap ( fig. 1 > b ) .
ppd1 therefore possesses two distinct fn3 - type domains , one of which is conserved in other paps and corresponds to residues 150 - 250 in the amino - acid sequence , while the second fn3 domain comprises the entire n - terminal end of the enzyme and is not present in other paps ( see supplementary fig. s3 ) .
the functional significance of this latter domain is unclear , but it may be involved in substrate specificity .
3.5 .
biological implications of ppd1 to determine the substrate specificity of ppd1 , its ability to digest and cleave circular and linear dna was determined ( fig. 6 >) .
it has been shown in model studies that synthetic complexes that resemble the catalytic centre of paps with different metal compositions exhibit dnase activity , possibly occurring by intercalation ( peralta et al. , 2010 > ; lanznaster et al. , 2005 > ; xavier et al. , 2009 >) .
compared with these studies , the activity of ppd1 is higher : more efficient dna digestion was observed as examined by separation of digestion products on agarose gels .
this ability of the enzyme was also confirmed by an enzymatic tube test using the standard kunitz method ( kunitz , 1950 >) , demonstrating a ppd1 dnase activity of 148 +/ - 27 kunitz units per milligram of protein .
we postulate that the fn3 - type domain of ppd1 may take part in presentation of the substrate ( e.g. dna ) to the catalytic site or in modification of the dna structure through binding at the dna groove , thus improving the catalytic activity of ppd1 .
the catalytic mechanism of pap has been so far elaborated for monoester substrates , and phosphodiesterase activity has been demonstrated in the pap family before , but only with small ester substrates ( cox et al. , 2007 >) .
in this work , we propose a dna molecule as a potential phosphodiesterase substrate .
molecular modelling shows that dna molecules could be bound to the surface of the ppd1 hexamer in a suitable orientation for such an interaction to occur ( fig. 7 >) .
however , at present we are unable to establish a precise catalytic mechanism , as well as a clear relationship between in vitro dna cleavage and in vivo ppd1 function , although one may speculate that this may include degradation of dna by ppd1 to maintain plant growth and repair or the involvement of ppd1 in pathogen defence .

figure 1 the crystal structure of ppd1 .
( a ) the ppd1 asymmetric unit is a trimer , shown as a cartoon coloured by individual subunits , with their n - and c - - terminal ends indicated .
the metal atoms in each subunit are shown as pink ( mn ) and purple ( fe ) spheres , with the bound phosphate ligands depicted as sticks .
the active sites are 54 a apart .
disulfides are shown as yellow spheres and sugar groups as silver and red sticks ; there are five of each per subunit ( one is occluded in the figure ) .
the cysteines or disulfide bridges labelled 1 ( cys577 - cys582 ) , 2 ( cys484 - cys491 ) and 3 ( cys396 - cys417 ) constrain flexible loops and help to position the interfacing residues , while that labelled 4 ( cys202 - cys366 ) is involved in hydrogen bonding to the adjacent subunit .
disulfide bridge 5 ( cys69 - cys82 ) bridges an extended loop ( or turn ) in the n - terminal domain and orients it towards the solvent channel above the active site .
the sugars are covalently bound to asn residues 92 , 241 , 292 , 502 and 525 .
for clarity , water molecules have been omitted .
( b ) cartoon representation of the superposition , using secondary - structure matching ( ssm ) in three dimensions ( krissinel & henrick , 2004a >) , of ppd1 ( red ) with a sweet potato pap ( blue ) subunit taken from pdb entry 1xzw ( schenk et al. , 2005 >) .
the metal atoms are shown as spheres .
the alignment of 353 residues gave an overall r.m.s.d. of 1.58 a between the two structures , with a z - score of 17.9 , and identified the extent of the pap domain .
the c - - terminal end of ppd1 , which is 19 residues longer than in sweet potato pap , extends into the active - site cavity of the neighbouring subunit of the trimer .
the fibronectin type iii domain identified by tsyguelnaia & doolittle ( 1998 >) for red kidney bean pap is also present in sweet potato and ppd1 , and is located at the lower centre of the figure .
the n - terminal end comprising residues 1 - 150 is unique to ppd1 and is not part of the known pap family .
( c ) the ppd1 hexamer generated from crystallographic symmetry , showing views along and perpendicular to the trimeric axis .
( d ) the trimer - trimer interface .
the active sites are positioned in the interior of the hexamer , approximately 38 a apart , with 12 intersubunit hydrogen - bonding interactions located at each of the interfaces , directly between the active sites .
the residues involved in hydrogen bonding are represented by transparent surfaces , while the active sites ( with bound phosphate ) are shown as spheres .
sugar groups are shown as sticks .
the c - terminal ends of the silver and cyan subunits , belonging to separate trimers , traverse the interface region in the solvent - filled channels and are shown with their terminal ser589 ( stick ) residues poised above the bound phosphate groups .
figure 2 small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) of ppd1 .
( a ) the experimental spectrum is shown with a simulated fit obtained using gasbor .
the radius of gyration , r g , was estimated from the low - angle scattering region using a guinier plot , i.e. log ( intensity ) versus q 2 .
the distance - distribution function , p ( r ) , with maximum linear dimension d max = 159.4 a , is shown in the insert .
( b ) the ab initio shape reconstruction by gasbor using p32 symmetry , showing agreement between the predicted molecular shape ( grey beads ) and the hexameric construct based on the crystal structure ( black cartoon ) .
water molecules have been omitted .
figure 3 ( a ) the active site of ppd1 with bound phosphate .
the fe and mn atoms are shown as purple and pink spheres , respectively .
the average metal - protein ligand distances for the three subunits are tyr315 1.9 a , his478 2.2 a , asp312 2.3 a and asp271 2.1 a at the fe site , and his434 2.2 a , his476 2.2 a , asn345 2.1 a and asp312 2.3 a at the mn site .
the phosphate anion is coordinated to both metals via a bridging o atom ( fe / mn - - o distance of ~ 2.3 a ) .
the sixth coordination position of each metal is provided by two of the remaining phosphate o atoms at ~ 2.5 a. the 2f o - f c electron - density maps are shown contoured at 1.2sigma .
( b ) the active site of ppd1 ( green ) and sweet potato pap ( blue ) .
a view is shown from the molecular surface looking into the bimetallic centre , with the conserved metal - ligand residues represented by sticks and the neighbouring , largely nonconserved , active - site residues shown in ball - and - stick representation .
the substrate - entry space is larger and more hydrophobic in ppd1 ( e.g. phe286 and phe444 at the substrate - entry pocket are separated by ~ 12 a , compared with the ~ 6 a separation between his295 and glu365 in sweet potato pap ) , which allows significant differences in substrate accommodation and substrate reactivity ( e.g. with bis - pnpp ) .
figure 4 ( a ) the 2f o - f c electron - density map ( contoured at 1sigma ) of the portion of the n - terminal domain of the ppd1 subunit with the highest overall b factor , showing evidence for two main chains in this region of the structure .
( b ) graphical depiction of all - atom normal - mode states of the ppd1 hexamer .
the trajectories for the first six nontrivial low - frequency normal modes are shown superimposed as directional arrows .
the largest structural fluctuations are centred on the n - terminal domains , which undergo rigid - body displacements relative to the pap domain .
determination of the motional correlation between these domain fluctuations and their import with respect to potential allosteric properties would require the analysis of a larger number of nodes ( wynsberghe & cui , 2006 >) ; nevertheless , these low - frequency modes may have a functional significance in view of the proximity of the n - terminal domains to the active sites , shown here as pink ( mn ) and purple ( fe ) spheres .
figure 5 ( a ) the n - terminal domain of each ppd1 subunit comprises two beta - sheets formed from seven beta - strands and encompasses residues 1 - 150 .
the first 20 residues were not modelled in the structure as they were not visible in the electron - density maps .
( b ) the ppd1 n - terminal end ( green ) aligned with the structure of the fibronectin type iii domain of human sidekick - 2 ( pdb entry 1wfn ; z = 4.6 , r.m.s.d .
= 2.99 a , 76 aligned residues , chain a ) , an s - type immunoglobulin .
the same orientation as in ( a ) is shown in the left panel and that with the view rotated about the vertical axis by 90degrees is shown in the right panel .
a portion of the n - terminal loop of pdb entry 1wfn occluding the view has been omitted for clarity .
( c ) the same viewpoints are shown for the ppd1 n - terminal end ( green ) aligned with the structure of the antitumour antibiotic c - 1027 apoprotein ( pdb entry 1j48 ; z = 5.9 , r.m.s.d .
= 2.04 a , 80 aligned residues , chain a ) , which is a v - type immunoglobulin .
the seven beta - strands in ppd1 all have corresponding well aligned counterparts in the nine - stranded 1j48 structure .
the ' extra ' hairpin beta - strands are replaced by a short loop in ppd1 .
the enediyne chromophore in the holo form of c - 1027 is bound at a hydrophobic pocket , the position of which is indicated by the arrow .
figure 6 dna - cleavage activity of ppd1 .
cleavage of circular plasmid dna ( top panel ) and linear high - molecular - weight lambda dna ( bottom panel ) by ppd1 .
the digestion products were separated in 1 or 0.6 % agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide .
figure 7 a simulated docking model of a short dna fragment lying across the positively charged ' groove ' on the surface of the ppd1 hexamer .
the fe - - mn site is located at the position of maximum positive ( blue ) charge density .
the flexible n - terminal domain of the subunit of one trimer is poised above this site and the docked dna strand sits adjacent to it. the surface - charge distribution is shown for ph 6 in units of kt / e - . docking calculations were performed using the program hex4.5 ( ritchie & kemp , 1999 >) .
surface electrostatic calculations were performed using the adaptive poisson - boltzmann solver ( apbs ; baker et al. , 2001 >) and were visualized using pymol .
pdb2pqr ( dolinsky et al. , 2004 >) was used to prepare the coordinates for input to apbs .

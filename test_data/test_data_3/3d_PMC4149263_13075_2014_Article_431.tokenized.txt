i have made this assertion many times , eliciting surprise if not mystification since lupus , the main focus of my research , and gout seem polar opposites .
lupus is a chronic antibody - mediated disease while gout is an acute cytokine - mediated disease .
what i say next would prompt genuine concern about my mental well - being .
' and , if i worked on gout , i would study the tophus ,' i say decisively .
lest you think i am going off the rails , i believe that study of the tophus holds important insights for immunology .
while interest in the tophus has surged recently as an outcome measure in treatment , it is often an afterthought , infrequently analyzed .
few studies have characterized tophi by modern immunofluorescence or electron microscopic techniques .
nevertheless , recent studies indicate that the tophus may be a goldmine to find real gems on immune regulation .
such studies are also strengthening what to me has always been quite simple and obvious : the lupus - gout connection .
despite differences in clinical course , both lupus and gout concern the response to single molecules .
these molecules are linked biochemically and , indeed , one is the product of the other .
for lupus , the molecule is dna ; for gout , it is uric acid .
dna is built of purines ( and pyrimidines ) , with uric acid a byproduct of purine degradation .
furthermore , both dna and uric acid are damage - associated molecular patterns , released during cell death to signal danger and trigger inflammation .
hence , my attraction to these diseases .
it is in the context of immune regulation that the tophus takes center stage .
monosodium urate ( msu ) , the crystalline salt form of uric acid , is one of the most proinflammatory chemicals ever found .
in the tophus core , msu should be present at enormous concentrations , with milk of urate essentially a suspension of gout crystals .
yet , despite the clear and present danger of so much msu - a veritable immunological time bomb - the tophus is a remarkably placid structure .
even when a tophus breaks down and milk of urate cascades out , the result appears benign , the surrounding skin neither red nor raw .
even a novice investigator has to ask what is going on ? by analogy to newton 's third law of motion , what is the equal and positive reaction that pushes back on the gout crystals' action ?
as shown in a provocative study by schauer and colleagues in the journal nature medicine , the neutrophil itself may perform the push back , pacify the tophus and shut down a gout attack just as it fires one up. this downregulatory mechanism involves an unexpected player : the neutrophil extracellular trap ( net ) .
a net is a mesh or web - like structure formed by the mixture of chromatin with the contents of neutrophil granules including antibacterial proteins such as myeloperoxidase , neutrophil elastase and cathelicidins .
in a process involving the generation of reactive oxygen species by naph oxidase ( nox ) , the net structure is extruded into the extracellular space to kill bacteria or fungi ensnared in this structure .
importantly , nets are present in the tophus .
given its essential role in host defense , why should a net control inflammation ?
the intriguing studies by schauer and colleagues provide a neat explanation .
thus , the proteases that stud the net can also degrade cytokines and hence curtail their action. with neutrophils present in high concentrations , as could occur in gouty inflammation , the nets can aggregate to increase the concentration of serine proteases to exert a counter - regulatory action .
such aggregated nets can degrade a wide array of cytokines such as il - 6 , mip - 1alpha , il - 1beta and tnf - alpha , all powerful players in gout pathogenesis .
since nets are present in the tophi , as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy , they could represent a counterforce that keeps the structure quiescent by degrading cytokines , perhaps produced by macrophages .
an important set of experiments in the study by schauer and colleagues used murine models of gouty inflammation in vivo .
these studies involved ncf1 ++ mice , which are a model of chronic granulomatous disease .
these mice are deficient in netosis because cells cannot produce reactive oxygen species by nox2 because of a mutation in neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 ( encoded by ncf1 ) .
in these studies , administration of msu crystals into air pouches of ncf1 ++ mice led to higher levels of cytokines than those of wild - type mice , while administration of msu crystals into the foot pads of these netosis - deficient animals had a more chronic course that lasted for weeks .
furthermore , in an air pouch model in wild - type mice , dnase treatment reduced the net aggregation and modulated cytokine production .
together , these studies suggest that netosis and the aggregation of nets can restrain inflammation or promote resolution in gout by degrading proinflammatory cytokines .
the role of nets in shaping the microenvironment of the tophus is intriguing but much work remains to be done to validate this hypothesis .
more histopathology is definitely needed since the few recent studies on this subject indicate a striking paucity of neutrophils in the tophus ; on the other hand , analysis of proteins in the tophus indicates the presence of myeloperoxidase and histones , both net constituents .
perhaps neutrophils only transiently populate the tophus , lay down the nets and then disappear .
while large datasets - whether genomic , transcriptomic or proteomic - are the vogue , it is refreshing to see pathological studies - the demonstration of nets near the tophus core - producing such exciting insights .
these insights in turn lead to a reconceptualization of the net - from wild west desperado into the sheriff bringing law and order .
while my heart remains wedded to lupus , i cannot help but feel a strange pull emanating from the tophus .
as the great jacques cousteau said : ' the sea , once it casts its spell , holds one in its net of wonder forever ' .
i feel the same way about the tophus and i am afraid that i too will be entranced by a wondrous place and become trapped in an entangling net .

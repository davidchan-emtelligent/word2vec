background the canonical wnt signaling pathway is a known regulator of cell proliferation during development and maintenance of the intestinal epithelium .
perturbations in this pathway lead to aberrant epithelial proliferation and intestinal cancer .
in the mature intestine , proliferation is confined to the relatively quiescent stem cells and the rapidly cycling transient - amplifying cells in the intestinal crypts .
although the wnt signal is believed to regulate all proliferating intestinal cells , surprisingly , this has not been thoroughly demonstrated .
this important determination has implications on intestinal function , especially during epithelial expansion and regeneration , and warrants an extensive characterization of wnt - activated cells .
methods to identify intestinal epithelial cells that actively receive a wnt signal , we analyzed intestinal wnt - reporter expression patterns in two different mouse lines using immunohistochemistry , enzymatic activity , in situ hybridization and qrt - pcr , then corroborated results with reporter - independent analyses .
wnt - receiving cells were further characterized for co - expression of proliferation markers , putative stem cell markers and cellular differentiation markers using an immunohistochemical approach .
finally , to demonstrate that wnt - reporter mice have utility in detecting perturbations in intestinal wnt signaling , the reporter response to gamma - irradiation was examined .
results wnt - activated cells were primarily restricted to the base of the small intestinal and colonic crypts , and were highest in numbers in the proximal small intestine , decreasing in frequency in a gradient toward the large intestine .
interestingly , the majority of the wnt - reporter - expressing cells did not overlap with the transient - amplifying cell population .
further , while wnt - activated cells expressed the putative stem cell marker musashi - 1 , they did not co - express dcamkl - 1 or cell differentiation markers .
finally , gamma - irradiation stimulated an increase in wnt - activated intestinal crypt cells .
conclusion we show , for the first time , detailed characterization of the intestine from wnt - reporter mice .
further , our data show that the majority of wnt - receiving cells reside in the stem cell niche of the crypt base and do not extend into the proliferative transient - amplifying cell population .
we also show that the wnt - reporter mice can be used to detect changes in intestinal epithelial wnt signaling upon physiologic injury .
our findings have an important impact on understanding the regulation of the intestinal stem cell hierarchy during homeostasis and in disease states .
background it is well established that the canonical wnt signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating intestinal proliferation at the level of the stem cell [ 1 - 6 ] and has been inferred to regulate proliferation of all intestinal crypt - based cells including the bulk of proliferative cells , the transient - amplifying - cell ( ta - cell ) population [ 1 - 7 ] .
surprisingly , the proliferative influence of the wnt signal on discrete cell populations within the crypt has not been previously characterized .
confounding issues for making these distinctions is that manipulation of wnt signaling in the stem cell population will invariably affect the downstream ta - cell population , complicating interpretation .
further , there is precedence for a wnt signal acting as a global regulator of proliferation in development prior to the establishment of the stem cell hierarchy [ 1 ] .
however , there is also evidence that proliferative control of crypt - based cells may be more multi - faceted than originally thought .
most interestingly , the ta - cell population does not express the recently identified wnt - target stem cell marker , lgr5 [ 8 ] , nor does it harbor nuclear beta - catenin staining , a hallmark of activated wnt signaling [ 9,10 ] .
in addition , wnt signaling has been shown to differentially regulate stem cell and ta - cell populations in other epithelial systems such as the skin [ 11,12 ] , suggesting that a more complex regulation of proliferation may exist .
therefore , determining the influential distinction of the wnt signal within the different proliferative intestinal cell populations is important for understanding epithelial homeostasis , regeneration after injury , and cellular dynamics during proliferative diseases .
epithelial proliferation is confined to the intestinal crypts .
the proliferative capacity of the intestine is defined by approximately 4 - 6 active stem cells and a second rapidly proliferating crypt population made up of the ta - cells that is situated adjacent to the stem cells .
multiple signaling cascades , including the wnt , notch , and sonic hedgehog pathways [ 13 ] , converge within the crypt niche to regulate the gradient of proliferation - to - differentiation .
the canonical wnt signaling pathway is well established as an important regulator of intestinal epithelial proliferation [ 1 ] and homeostasis [ 1,14 - 16 ] .
during mouse intestinal development , ablation of the downstream transcription factor , tcf4 links loss of wnt signaling with a loss of epithelial proliferation [ 1 ] .
in the adult mouse , a proliferative role for this pathway is recapitulated when the wnt inhibitor dickkopf - 1 is over - expressed , leading to collapse of the crypt structure [ 2 ] , and most notably in disease , where mutations in this pathway result in epithelial hyperproliferation leading to colorectal cancer [ 5 ] .
the canonical wnt signal is conveyed through the binding of a soluble ligand to cell surface co - receptors , frizzled and lrp5 / 6 [ 17 ] , then propagated by inhibiting the degradation of beta - catenin , which stimulates the transcription of target genes [ 18,19 ] .
the wnt target gene lgr5 is a putative stem cell marker based upon its crypt mrna localization and a functional knock - in reporter experiment [ 8 ] .
interestingly , lgr5 is expressed only in epithelial columnar cells , but not higher up in the crypt within the ta - cell population .
this suggests that wnt signals may influence discrete cell populations rather than act as a global proliferative regulator within the crypt .
therefore , it is possible that proliferation of stem cells and the ta - cell population are differentially controlled .
in other systems , such as the hematopoietic system , the wnt signal also provides proliferative cues to progenitor cells [ 20 ] .
self - renewal of both the hematopoietic stem cells and their ta - cell populations are thought to be regulated by the wnt pathway .
conversely , in epithelial systems such as the skin , stem and ta - cell populations appear to be differentially activated by wnt signals [ 11,12 ] .
in the intestine , however , definitive stem cell markers have been slow to be established .
the absence of these markers and the inability to accurately distinguish stem and progenitor populations within the intestinal crypt presents an obstacle for determining if wnt acts as a global regulator of cell proliferation .
one approach to establishing the role of wnt signaling on the discrete intestinal crypt cell populations is to characterize cells within the crypt that are wnt - activated .
here , we validate for the first time , the wnt - reporter mouse as a useful resource for evaluation of wnt - activation within the intestine .
further , we establish that during intestinal homeostasis , activation of the wnt pathway occurred primarily in an intestinal progenitor cell and not in the actively cycling ta - cell population .
our data validates the wnt - reporter mouse as a functional tool for detecting changes in wnt signaling within the intestinal epithelium .
we show that the canonical wnt pathway is stimulated in response to gamma - irradiation - induced apoptosis both by an increased expression of the wnt - reporter as well as wnt ligands and the c - myc target gene .
the characterization of wnt signaling within the intestine provides an important foundation for understanding the regulation of the intestinal stem cell hierarchy during homeostasis and in disease states .
methods mice mice were housed in a specific pathogen - free environment under strictly controlled light cycle conditions , fed a standard rodent lab chow (# 5001 pmi nutrition international , brentwood , mo ) , and provided water ad libitum .
all procedures were performed in accordance to the ohsu animal care and use committee .
the wnt - reporter topgal [ 11 ] , c57bl / 6 , and min [ 21 ] mice were obtained from the jackson laboratory ( bar harbor , me ) and the batgal wnt - reporter mice were a kind gift from dr. stefano piccolo [ 22 ] .
analyses of wnt - responsive intestinal cells immunohistochemical analyses wnt signaling activity was characterized in adult topgal , batgal , and c57bl / 6 mouse intestines .
the entire length of the intestine was prepared for frozen or paraffin sectioning and the methods used for single and multi - label immunohistochemical staining are previously described [ 23 ] .
the following antisera were used : anti - beta - galactosidase ( beta - gal ; immunology consultants laboratory , inc. ; newberg , or ; 1:500 dilution ) , anti - musashi - 1 (# 14h - 1 ; a gift from dr. h. okano , keio university , tokyo ; 1:500 ) , uea - 1 ( sigma ; st. louis , mo ; 1:500 ) , anti - cryptidin ( a kind gift from andy oulette , university of california - irvine ; 1:25 ) and anti - 5 - ht ( serotonin ; incstar ; stillwater , mn ; 1:500 ) .
primary antibodies were detected with species appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to cy3 , fitc ( jackson immunoresearch ; west grove , pa ) or alexa - 488 ( molecular probes ; eugene , or ) .
tissues were counterstained with hoechst ( 33258 ; sigma ; st. louis , mo ; 0.1 mug / ml ) .
paraffin embedded tissue sections were stained with antibodies for beta - catenin ( transduction labs ; lexington , ky ; 1:500 dilution ) to detect nuclear localization .
staining was performed as described previously [ 24 ] .
biotinylated secondary antibodies and diaminobenzidine ( dab ) were employed for visualization .
images were captured on a dmr microscope and dc500 digital camera with im50 image manager software ( leica microsystems ; bannockburn , il ) .
cy3 images were captured as grayscale and digitally converted to red images .
quantification of beta - gal - positive cells to establish the percentage of beta - gal - positive crypts and villi down the length of the intestine , tissue sections from mice stained with antibodies to beta - gal as described above were quantified .
at least 1500 crypts or villi were screened from n = 2 - 5 mice and reported as a percentages .
for a more detailed analysis of the location of beta - gal - positive cells within the crypt , the proximal small intestinal crypts were divided into equal thirds .
beta - gal - positive cells for each region ( upper , middle and lower third ) were tallied and compared to the total number of beta - gal - positive crypt cells (> 1500 crypts ; n = 2 mice ) .
to determine the percentage of dual - labeled beta - gal - expressing paneth cells , tissue sections were co - stained with uea - 1 and beta - gal antibodies as described above .
a total of > 1500 crypts / mouse were screened ( n = 3 mice ) .
beta - gal enzymatic activity five micron frozen sections were washed in phosphate buffered saline and prepared for 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - inodyl beta - d - galactoside ( x - gal ) detection followed by nuclear - fast red counterstain modified from previously described protocols [ 25 ] .
assessment of proliferative status to detect proliferating cells , 5 mum frozen tissue sections were stained with antibodies against ki67 ( abcam # ab15580 ; cambridge , ma ; 1:250 ) and appropriate fluorescent - conjugated secondary antibodies .
alternatively , mice were injected with 5 - bromo - 2'deoxyuridine / 5 - fluoro - 2'deoxyuridine ( brdu / frdu , 120 / 12 mg / kg body weight ; sigma ; st. louis , mo ) 48 h prior to sacrifice .
tissue sections were co - stained sequentially with antibodies to brdu and beta - gal .
for brdu staining a modified protocol from the abcam resources website was used . briefly , tissues were washed in phosphate buffered saline and incubated in blocking buffer ( 1 % bsa , 0.3 % triton x - 100 , 1 mm cacl2 ) prior to staining with antibodies to brdu [ 23 ] ( a gift from dr. jeffrey gordon , washington university school of medicine , st. louis , mo ; 1:1000 ) and detected with fluorescent secondary antibodies .
the tissue was imaged after each step and the acquired images overlayed using canvas software ( acd systems ; miami , fl ) .
to quantify beta - gal and brdu expression , > 1000 crypts per animal ( n = 3 ) were scored for crypts containing co - labeled cells .
wnt signaling response to intestinal damage irradiation - induced epithelial damage topgal and c57bl / 6 mice were exposed to 12 gy and sacrificed at 1 , 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h post - irradiation .
intestinal tissue was harvested and processed as described above and stained with hematoxylin & eosin ( h & e ) or with antibodies for beta - gal or beta - catenin .
the number of beta - gal - positive crypts were counted and compared to the total number of crypts in each tissue section (>= 1300 crypts counted / time point ) .
intestinal samples from at least three mice per time point were analyzed ( n = 19 mice total ) .
further , for untreated and 24 h post - irradiation time points , the number of beta - gal - positive cells per crypt ( 1 , 2 or > 2 ) was also tallied and normalized to the total number of crypts (> 1500 crypts counted / time point ; n = 2 mice each ) .
the number of cells co - stained with antibodies for ki67 and beta - gal were also determined for both non - irradiated ( n = 2 ) and 24 h - post - irradiated intestines ( n = 2 ; >= 2000 crypts / animal ) .
average values were represented +/ - standard deviation .
statistical significance was determined by unpaired t - tests assuming equal variances using microsoft excel .
p values < 0.05 were considered significant .
mrna expression in situ hybridization to validate the gene expression pattern of lacz , rna in situ hybridization was performed as previously described [ 26 ] using digoxigenin - labeled lacz riboprobes ( 1 mug / mul ) , alkaline - phosphatase - conjugated anti - digoxigenin antibody and bm purple substrate ( roche ; indianapolis , in ) .
quantitative analysis of mrna expression from isolated intestinal cell populations beta - gal mrna has a shorter half - life than the protein [ 27,28 ] and can provide a more precise detection of wnt - activated cells .
a modified weiser preparation [ 29,30 ] was used to isolate crypt and villus epithelium from adult wnt - reporter mouse small intestine .
differentiated epithelial cells were removed in 1 mm edta and 1 mm dtt , where crypt epithelium was isolated in 1 mm edta and 5 mm dtt .
total rna was purified from the isolated villus and crypt cell populations and cdna was synthesized as we have previously described [ 31 ] .
quantitative rt - pcr was performed using a sybr green - based assay , primers to beta - gal and a 7900 ht sequence detector according to established protocols [ 31,32 ] .
each cdna sample was analyzed in triplicate , along with triplicate samples of the endogenous reference gene , glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase .
each assay for lacz expression was performed at least three independent times on n = 3 mice .
the fold - change was determined using established methods [ 31,32 ] and reported relative to levels in crypts .
to demonstrate intestinal wnt - responsiveness in the topgal model , mice were irradiated as described above and sacrificed 24 h later .
crypt epithelial cells were isolated from the small intestine as described above and evaluated by qrt - pcr for gene expression of three wnt ligands ( wnt3 , wnt6 , wnt9b ) , a secreted wnt inhibitor ( sfrp2 ) , and a wnt target gene ( c - myc ) ( n = 2 non - irradiated , n = 3 irradiated ) .
for wnt9b , only distal small intestinal crypt epithelium was surveyed , due to its restricted expression to this region [ 33 ] .
primer sequences are presented in table 1 .

topgal and batgal transgenic mice express the reporter , beta - galactosidase ( beta - gal ) , in response to reception and processing of an endogenous canonical wnt signal , marking cells activated by the signaling cascade [ 11,22 ] .
both mouse reporter lines displayed a similar pattern ( figure 1a , b ) , therefore topgal mouse intestines are depicted unless otherwise noted .
in the wnt - reporter mouse intestine , we found strong beta - gal expression in epithelial cells within the crypt base ( figure 1a , b , d ) .
typically , positive crypts within the proximal small intestine ( psi ) contained only one or two beta - gal - positive cells ( figure 1a - b ) , although some crypts were uniformly populated with beta - gal - positive cells that extended into the ta - cell region ( figure 1c ) and onto the adjacent villi .
the reporter protein expression pattern was confirmed by detecting beta - gal expression by enzymatic activity using the substrate , x - gal ( figure 1e ) .
interestingly , while single cells within the crypt base were detected , no crypts with the broader expression pattern , nor villus epithelial expression were observed .
we corroborated our findings in the wnt - reporter mice with identification of crypt cells harboring nuclear beta - catenin in wild - type mice , a hallmark of wnt activation ( figure 1f ) .
the nuclear beta - catenin staining pattern recapitulated the wnt - reporter protein expression pattern ( figure 1a , b , d ) .
because of the discrepancy between the beta - gal protein expression on the villus detected by antibodies ( figure 1c and 2d ) and the crypt - based expression of beta - gal enzymatic activity ( figure 1e ) , we analyzed reporter rna expression .
both in situ hybridization ( figure 1g , h ) and qrt - pcr for the lacz gene in isolated crypt or villus epithelial populations ( figure 1i ) demonstrated that wnt - activated cells were restricted to the crypt base .
an indepth examination of the crypt localization of beta - gal - positive cells revealed that the majority resided in the base of the crypt ( 79.6 %) , the stem cell niche and the location of differentiated paneth cells , while fewer beta - gal - positive cells were located in the middle third ( 17.4 %) or the upper third of the crypt ( 3.0 % ; figure 1j ) .
figure 1 adult mouse expression pattern of wnt - receiving epithelial cells .
( a,c,d ) cryopreserved adult topgal mouse proximal small intestinal ( psi ) or colonic and ( b ) batgal mouse psi tissue sections were stained with antibodies against beta - galactosidase ( beta - gal , red ) and counterstained with hoechst dye ( blue ) .
( a,b ) the majority of crypts in the psi contained only one wnt - activated cell or was devoid of positive cells ( arrow ) .
there were occasional mesenchymal cells positive for beta - gal ( arrowhead ) in batgal intestines ( b ) .
( c ) occasionally , beta - gal - expressing cells were detected throughout the crypt epithelium and on adjacent villi .
( d ) colonic crypts contained only rare single beta - gal positive cells near the crypt base .
( e ) wnt - receiving cells detected by enzymatic activity , x - gal staining ( blue , arrow ) .
( f ) adult wild - type mouse psi was stained with antibodies against beta - catenin ( brown ; arrow ) to detect nuclear expression and counterstained with hematoxylin .
( g - i ) analyses of reporter rna expression pattern and localization was determined by in situ hybridization ( g,h ; purple , arrow ) and are consistent with the expression pattern in ( a ) .
( i ) qrt - pcr for lacz gene expression in isolated crypt or villus epithelial cells from topgal psi demonstrated expression in the crypts .
( j ) the crypt localization of beta - gal - positive cells was highest in the lower third and decreased in numbers in the middle and upper third .
( k ) crypts with wnt - receiving cells in topgal intestinal sections were higher in the psi ( 15.2 %) and decreased down the length of the intestine to 0.8 % in the colon .
( l ) the number of beta - gal - positive villi also reflected a decreasing gradient with the highest numbers in the psi ( 12.3 %) , less in the the middle small intestine ( msi ; 4.0 %) and the least in the distal small intestine ( dsi ; 0.2 %) .

interestingly , a gradient of wnt - activated , beta - gal - positive cells existed in the intestine , with 15.2 % of crypts containing a wnt - activated cell in the psi compared to 0.8 % of colonic crypts ( figure 1k ) .
additionally , villi with beta - gal - positive epithelium were also detected in a decreasing gradient down the length of the small intestine ( figure 1l ) .
this pattern of wnt - activated cells parallels the decreasing gradient in cell turnover and proliferation rates that exist down the length of the small intestine and colon [ 34 ] .
wnt - receiving cells express cell proliferation markers but are not located in the ta - cell region the majority of beta - gal - positive cells reside in the base of the intestinal crypt , suggesting that wnt signaling may influence proliferation in the progenitor population and not the ta - cell population .
to distinguish if the wnt signal conveys a restricted rather than global proliferative response within the intestinal crypt , intestines from wnt - reporter mice were co - stained with antibodies to beta - gal and the proliferation marker ki67 , which designates cells undergoing late g1 , s , g2 or m phases of the cell cycle .
ki67 - positive cells were located in the middle portion of the crypts and extended toward the lower third , consistent with the location of both the ta - cell population and crypt progenitor cells .
analysis was restricted to crypts containing one or two beta - gal positive cells .
in most of these crypts , the majority of the ki67 staining did not co - localize with beta - gal - positive cells ( figure 2a - c , arrow ) .
occasionally , beta - gal - expressing crypt cells were also ki67 - positive ( 7.1 %) , potentially indicating that this wnt - activated cell was actively dividing ( figure 2a - c , arrowhead ) .
to determine if the wnt - activated cells were label - retaining cells , we performed brdu label - retaining assays by injecting brdu into topgal mice 48 h prior to analysis .
this timeframe is sufficient for brdu - labeled epithelial cells to give rise to brdu - positive descendents that have migrated up the villus ( figure 2d , lagging edge brdu - cell marked by green arrow ) .
at this analytical time point , the brdu - labeled progeny have migrated away from the brdu - label - retaining stem cell in the crypt ( figure 2d - g , white asterisk ) , as apparent by the intervening brdu - negative cells ( figure 2d - e ) .
the beta - gal - positive villus epithelial cells overlap with the brdu - positive villus cells ( figure 2d , red bracket ) suggesting that they might be derived from the dual brdu - positive , beta - gal positive cell in the crypt .
approximately 7.5 % of crypts contained cells with co - localized beta - gal and brdu ( figure 2f - g and figure 3 ) , suggesting that a subset of beta - gal - positive cells were also crypt label - retaining cells .

figure 3 beta - gal and brdu co - staining scenarios .
wnt - reporter mouse intestines were injected with brdu 2 days prior to analyses to assess the proliferative status of the beta - gal positive crypt - based cells .
( a ) approximately 7.5 % of crypts contained a cell that was dual - labeled for beta - gal and brdu , reflecting cells that have been retained within the crypt ( label - retaining cells ) and that were wnt - activated .
( b ) approximately 27.3 % of crypts contained a single brdu - positive cell , possibly representing a " stem cell " that is not designated by the wnt signaling pathway .
this would be in line with the recently identified bmi - 1 positive stem cell .
( c ) 6.1 % of crypts contained a single positive beta - gal cell .
this cell likely represents a cell that is activated by the wnt signal after the effective brdu labeling half - life in the animal .
finally , ( d ) a small percentage of crypts , 1.6 % , contained a beta - gal - positive cell and a brdu - positive cell distinct from one another , likely representing a combination of the described scenarios .
these scenarios are schematized in cartoon form beneath the corresponding fluorescent image that describes our perception of what each scenario may represent .
in classical stem cell hierarchy , the lowest circle represents a progenitor cell residing near the base of the crypt and upper circles represent the progeny .
solid green circles represent brdu - positive cells , solid red circles represent an activated wnt cell , open red circles represent a cell that may have been wnt - activated prior to brdu labeling .
these many different scenarios reflect the complex nature of the role of wnt signaling on the stem cell hierarchy within the intestinal crypt .
to determine if wnt - receiving crypt cells might share expression with stem or early progenitor cells , wnt - reporter mouse intestines were stained with antibodies for a putative intestinal epithelial stem cell marker , musashi - 1 ( msi - 1 ) [ 35 - 37 ] .
although msi - 1 and beta - gal co - localized ( figure 4a - b ) , the msi - 1 antibody displayed a broader staining pattern within the crypt , also encompassing the ta - cell population .
dcamkl - 1 is an alternative putative stem cell marker [ 38 ] , however wnt - activated cells did not co - express dcamkl - 1 ( figure 4c - e ) .
figure 4 characterization of putative stem cell markers in wnt - activated cells .
( a - b ) the putative stem cell marker , musashi - 1 ( msi - 1 ; green ) had broad expression within the crypt and co - localized with crypt beta - gal - expressing cells ( red ) .
( c - e ) beta - gal - positive cells ( red ) do not co - localize with another putative stem cell marker , dcamkl - 1 ( green ) .
solid white line marks the epithelial - mesenchymal boundary of the intestinal crypt .
( f - g ) dcamkl - 1 is expressed in a subset of enteroendocrine cells .
serial sections of mouse psi were stained for serotonin ( 5 - ht , an enteroendocrine marker ; f ) or dcamkl - 1 ( g ) , a proposed intestinal stem cell marker .
arrowheads mark a single cell that co - labeled with both antibodies .
arrows mark dcamkl - 1 - positive cells that do not express serotonin .
bar = 25 mum .
progenitor cell populations are not the only residents within the intestinal crypt .
in the small intestine , differentiated paneth cells reside at the crypt base , and differentiating goblet and enteroendocrine cells are also scattered within the crypt .
interestingly , a recent study implicated wnt signaling in paneth cell differentiation [ 39 ] .
to determine if ki67 - negative / beta - gal - positive cells were differentiated cells that resided at the crypt base [ 40 ] , we stained wnt - reporter mouse intestines with antibodies raised against epithelial differentiation markers .
co - localization of beta - gal and the lectin , uea - 1 , a dual goblet and paneth cell marker , revealed that approximately 40.7 % of the beta - gal - positive cells possessed overlapping paneth cell expression ( figure 5a - c ; arrowhead ) , while 59.3 % were distinct from paneth cells ( figure 5a - c ; arrow ) .
further , dual - labeling with antibodies to beta - gal and cryptidin , a paneth cell - specific marker , revealed similar findings ( figure 5d - f ) .
it is possible that wnt - activated , differentiated paneth cells that retain beta - gal protein are progeny from a wnt - activated stem cell in a similar fashion as the beta - gal - positive villus epithelial cells .
additionally , beta - gal - positive cells were distinct from enteroendocrine cells when tissue sections were co - stained for the serotonin marker 5 - ht ( figure 5g - i ) , and distinct from crypt - based goblet cells ( data not shown ) .

( a - c ) co - incubation of antibodies to beta - gal ( red ) and uea - 1 ( green ) , a lectin to mark paneth and goblet cells , identifies distinct wnt - activated cells ( arrow ) and overlapping expression ( arrowhead ) .
( d - f ) similar results are observed for the paneth - cell - specific marker , cryptidin ( green ) when co - stained with beta - gal ( red ) .
( g - i ) co - localization is not observed with dual staining of beta - gal ( red ) and the enteroendocrine marker serotonin ( 5 - ht ; green ) .
solid white line marks the epithelial - mesenchymal boundary of the intestinal crypt .

wnt - reporter mouse intestine responded to physiologic increase in wnt signaling in some intestinal diseases , such as colorectal cancer , the wnt signaling pathway is aberrantly stimulated in epithelial cells resulting in uncontrolled hyperproliferation .
this establishes a role for wnt signaling in epithelial proliferation and highlights the importance of the wnt signal in maintaining epithelial homeostasis .
it has previously been shown , and we demonstrate here , that batgal reporter mice display an increase in wnt signaling readout when crossed to tumor - forming min mice that overstimulate the wnt pathway [ 22 ] ( figure 6a ) .
to investigate if the wnt - reporter mice are useful tools for increased wnt signaling readout during tissue repair after injury , we examined the reporter response to intestinal gamma - irradiation exposure , which is known to stimulate an epithelial proliferative response .

bar = 25 mum .
( f ) the number of beta - gal - positive cells per crypt was scored in both non - irradiated ( non - ir ) and 24 h post - irradiated ( post - ir ) intestines .
the percentage of crypts with 1 , 2 or greater than 2 beta - gal - positive cells are shown .
( g ) qrt - pcr performed on mrna from small intestinal crypt fractions of topgal mice 24 h post - irradiation revealed an increase in the lacz reporter gene compared to non - irradiated samples .
in addition , three wnt ligands known to be expressed in the intestinal epithelium ( wnt3 , wnt6 , and wnt9b ) and a wnt target gene ( c - myc ) increased in response to the irradiation stimulus .
exposure to gamma - irradiation elicits massive crypt cell apoptosis , coincident with proliferative changes that peak within the first 24 hours [ 41 ] .
to determine if activation of wnt signaling is important in a regenerative response and if it can be monitored in a wnt - reporter mouse , we subjected topgal mice to 12 gy of gamma - irradiation .
intestinal tissues were processed and analyzed 1 , 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h after irradiation ( figure 6b ) .
at 1 h post - irradiation , the intestinal epithelium appeared relatively normal .
wnt - responsive cells , as detected by protein levels , were still present in low numbers in the crypts of the psi ( figure 6b - c ) .
however , by 24 h post - irradiation , near the peak of the apoptotic response , a significant increase in the number of crypts with wnt - receiving cells was detected ( p = 0.004 , figure 6b , d , e ) .
additionally , we observed more wnt - receiving cells per crypt ( figure 6d - f ) compared to non - irradiated controls ( figure 1a ) or to the 1 h post - irradiation time point ( figure 6c ) .
the most striking increase was represented by beta - gal - positive crypts harboring greater than two wnt - activated cells ( figure 6f ) .
the wnt response returned to non - irradiated , homeostatic levels by 72 h ( figure 6b ) .
interestingly , the increase in wnt - receiving cells paralleled an increase in beta - gal / ki67 double - positive cells ( data not shown ) .
while the majority of ki67 - positive cells remained beta - gal - negative , dual beta - gal and ki67 - positive cells increased approximately 3 - fold ( from 7.1 % to 23.1 %) .
this double - positive population may represent an actively dividing stem cell or immediate progeny from a newly divided progenitor cell .
to correlate increased wnt responsiveness to gamma - irradiation , the mrna expression levels of the three endogenous epithelial wnt ligands were determined [ 33 ] .
crypt epithelium from 24 h post - irradiation and non - irradiated topgal intestines was isolated and characterized for changes in wnt ligand expression ( figure 6g ) .
reporter lacz mrna expression was elevated in response to gamma - irradiation exposure by ~ 148 - fold in the crypt epithelium .
consistent with this observation , increased expression of the wnt target gene c - myc was observed ( 34 - fold ) .
additionally , the canonical wnt ligands wnt3 , wnt6 , and wnt9b were also elevated by 10 - , 51 - and 50 - fold respectively .
further , the mrna expression of the secreted frizzled protein 2 ( sfrp2 ) , a wnt inhibitor , decreased from levels higher than the wnt ligands at steady state , to undetectable levels in response to gamma - irradiation ( data not shown ) .
this data suggests that induced injury to the epithelium results in detectable changes in wnt signaling that can be appreciated in the wnt - reporter mouse .
discussion while it is well established that wnt signaling controls intestinal epithelial proliferation and homeostasis , the distinction between the role of wnt as a direct regulator of both the crypt - based stem cell and ta - cell populations has not been firmly established [ 1 - 3,5,6 ] .
further , aberrant wnt signaling has been described as a proliferative stimulus in intestinal disease states such as colorectal cancer [ 5 ] but a role for the pathway in epithelial regeneration after injury has not been defined .
here we examined the pattern of wnt - activated cells in the normal mouse intestine during homeostasis and after irradiation - induced injury .
further , we characterize intestinal expression of the wnt - reporter mouse and show that it is a useful tool in both monitoring wnt signaling during homeostasis and in response to an epithelial - induced injury .
in both topgal and batgal mouse intestines , wnt - activated cells , as identified by wnt - reporter expression , were primarily confined to the epithelial compartment .
in the small intestine , two crypt - based patterns were observed .
the majority of small intestinal crypts harbored one or two beta - gal - positive cells detected by both protein and rna localization .
in a minority of crypts the entire crypt population was positive for beta - gal protein expression that extended onto the adjacent villus .
additionally beta - gal - positive cells were observed on villi that were associated with crypts containing single beta - gal - positive cells .
however , villus protein expression was not recapitulated with rna expression profiling using in situ hybridization for lacz on tissue sections or by qrt - pcr for lacz expression in isolated crypt and villus epithelial cell populations .
together this suggests that wnt - reporter expression on the villus was a manifestation of the long half - life of the beta - gal protein [ 27 ] .
the unique ability to track both protein and rna expression in the wnt - reporter mouse provides the power to analyze both lineage tracing ( protein ) and an identification of the wnt - activated cell ( rna ) within the same model system .
to corroborate that the wnt reporter provided a consistent wnt - activated cell readout , antibody staining to detect cells harboring nuclear localized beta - catenin was performed .
consistent with the frequency of beta - gal - positive cells , a similar percentage of psi crypts harbored one or two cells near the crypt base that stained positive for nuclear beta - catenin .
these data suggest that only a small number of cells within certain crypts were actively receiving a wnt signal .
interestingly , but consistent with the observed decreasing gradient of epithelial cell turnover rates down the length of the intestine , a greater number of wnt - activated cells were observed in the psi ( 15.2 % of crypts harbored at least one beta - gal - positive cell ) as compared to the colon ( 0.8 %) .
similarly , bmi1 - positive putative stem cells also display a gradient down the length of the intestine , with greater numbers in the psi and nearly undetectable levels in the distal small intestine [ 42 ] .
while it is widely accepted that wnt signaling influences proliferation in all crypts , the number of wnt - activiated cells detected in wnt - reporter mouse intestines was lower than expected .
there are several possibilities to explain this discrepancy .
it is possible that the wnt morphogen acts in a gradient highest in the base of the crypt and highest in the psi with decreasing concentration down the length of the intestine .
in this scenario , it is possible that only the highest levels of wnt - activated cells are detected in the wnt - reporter mice .
dilution of the protein as cells divide and migrate up the villus is therefore only detected in intestinal regions with the highest levels of wnt activation .
presence of beta - gal - positive villus cells may therefore identify regions of the intestine with robust wnt signaling .
some reports suggest a higher level of nuclear localized beta - catenin in the crypt base than we show here [ 9,10 ] .
although believed to be a gold standard , comparing nuclear beta - catenin with wnt - activated cells could be misleading .
some cancer cells display high levels of nuclear beta - catenin in the absence of wnt activity [ 43 ] .
the mechanism for this in cancer is unclear , although there are known inhibitors of nuclear localized beta - catenin that inhibit wnt activation by binding to beta - catenin within the nucleus , including apc , chibby and duplin [ 44 - 46 ] .
despite the decreasing gradient of detectable wnt signal down the length of the intestine , there remains an important physiologic role of wnt signaling in colonic homeostasis .
it was recently reported that the wnt target gene and putative stem cell marker , lgr5 , is located in base of both small intestinal and colonic crypts [ 8 ] .
an alternative explanation for the proximal to distal gradient of detectable wnt - activated cells could be that wnt signaling in the colonic epithelium is regulated differently than in the small intestine .
there are differences in expression of the tcf / lef - 1 family members between the two regions [ 47 ] and therefore it is likely that other regulatory factors may convey differences in colonic wnt activity .
due to these caveats in tracking wnt - activated cells using other approaches , wnt - reporter mice offer a powerful and direct approach for identifying wnt - activated cells .
wnt - receiving intestinal cells represent a progenitor population the rarity of single beta - gal - positive and nuclear beta - catenin - positive cells in the base of the crypt suggests that these wnt - receiving cells may be a progenitor cell population .
therefore , to further characterize the proliferative status of the beta - gal - positive cells , we surveyed intestinal sections with antibodies to ki67 and beta - gal .
the majority of ki67 - positive cells were located mid - crypt in the ta - cell region and were negative for beta - gal , thus not wnt - activated .
this suggests that wnt signaling is not a general proliferative stimulant .
supportive of this observation , cells containing nuclear beta - catenin were also not located within the proliferative ta - cell population , consistent with previous data from both the small intestine or colon [ 9,10 ] .
further , ta - cells have been shown to lack expression of a previously described wnt - target gene , lgr5 , that marks a columnar crypt - based proposed stem cell [ 8 ] .
this suggests that a second pathway may regulate proliferation of the ta - cell population .
recent evidence shows that the polycomb protein bmi1 , regulated in a wnt - independent fashion , marks a putative intestinal stem cell population residing at " cell position 4 " within the crypt [ 42 ] .
bmi1 - expressing cells display a unique pattern from lgr5 - positive cells in the intestinal crypt [ 8 ] .
these markers identify a population of " stem cells " with different kinetics , suggesting a more complex regulation of the intestinal stem cell hierarchy [ 48 ] .
we observed that a portion of ki67 - positive cells were also beta - gal positive .
this represented 7.1 % of all crypt - based beta - gal positive cells and may possibly represent the stem cell or an early progenitor .
we examined co - expression of beta - gal with a putative stem cell marker , msi - 1 .
even though the majority of beta - gal - positive cells co - stained with this putative stem cell marker , msi - 1 displayed a broader pattern of expression that extended into the ta - cell region .
while it is controversial whether or not msi - 1 is a true stem cell marker in the intestine , it may be expressed in a gradient including stem cells and their immediate descendents [ 35,37 ] .
despite this , co - localization of beta - gal and msi - 1 supports the idea that wnt - activated cells could represent progenitor cells .
interestingly , dcamkl - 1 , a second putative stem cell marker [ 38 ] , did not co - localize with beta - gal positive cells .
it is likely that dcamkl - 1 marks a lineage progenitor for enteroendocrine cells , as it is also expressed on the villus epithelium in a similar pattern with serotonin , an enteroendocrine cell marker ( figure 4f , g ) .
additionally , the putative stem cell marker , lgr5 , is reported to have an mrna expression pattern encompassing a greater number of crypt cells and more total crypts [ 8 ] than the profile of wnt - activated cells we show here .
the overt discrepancy in staining patterns of the putative stem cell markers highlights the current dearth of tools available for pinpointing the intestinal stem cell in vivo .
we also observed a population of ki67 - negative , beta - gal - positive cells .
these cells might represent quiescent stem cells or the differentiated progeny of a wnt - activated progenitor cell .
therefore , we performed double staining with beta - gal and select antibodies for differentiated cell lineages .
beta - gal - positive cells did not express differentiation markers for goblet or enteroendocrine cells .
although a majority of the paneth cells did not express beta - gal ( 98.7 %) , a small subset was beta - gal - positive .
the presence of these double positive cells support the previously reported role for wnt signaling in retaining paneth cells to the crypt base [ 39 ] .
alternatively , these beta - gal - positive paneth cells could be recent descendents of an activated progenitor , as we show for differentiated epithelial cells ( figures 1c and 2d , e ) , highlighting the usefulness of protein detection for lineage tracing in this model system .
despite the role of wnt signaling within the differentiated paneth cell population , the majority of crypt - based beta - gal - positive cells did not express differentiated cell markers ( 59.3 %) .
therefore , it is likely that these wnt - activated cells represent a progenitor pool .
there is an emerging view of a more complex intestinal stem cell hierarchy with multiple pools of progenitor populations .
in the absence of an intestinal reconstitution assay to validate wnt - dependent and wnt - independent putative stem cell pools , we cannot functionally determine the relationship of wnt - activated cells within the hierarchy .
it is likely that beta - gal and nuclear beta - catenin expression may be present in only a subset of stem cells .
additionally , quiescent stem cells might not express beta - gal , nuclear beta - catenin , lgr5 or bmi1 .
despite these caveats , our data revealed a limited number of wnt - activated cells within intestinal crypts and is consistent with a role for a wnt signal in a progenitor pool .
wnt - reporter response to gamma - irradiation - induced injury to determine if a wnt signal was elicited in response to epithelial injury , we examined intestinal wnt activation after gamma - irradiation .
upon exposure to gamma - irradiation , analyses of wnt - reporter mice revealed an appreciable increase in both the number of crypts harboring wnt - activated cells , as well as an increase in the total number of wnt - activated cells per crypt .
this observation was verified at the rna level , demonstrating that irradiation - induced injury elicited an intestinal wnt response .
to confirm this increase in intestinal wnt signaling , we surveyed for expression of a number of wnt pathway genes in isolated epithelial crypt cells using qrt - pcr .
an increase in lacz was accompanied by increases in the three canonical wnt ligands reported to be expressed in the crypt epithelium ( wnt3 , wnt6 , wnt9b ) and the downstream target c - myc .
further , a decrease in the secreted wnt inhibitor ( sfrp2 ) was observed .
this demonstrated physiological intestinal damage can be appreciated using a wnt - reporter mouse .
conclusion our data provides a carefully detailed analysis of endogenous wnt signaling in the intestine of wnt - reporter mice and corroborates reporter expression with nuclear beta - catenin staining .
wnt - activated cells are predominantly located in the base of the crypt where a progenitor population and differentiated paneth cells reside .
this expression pattern is consistent with reported roles for wnt signaling in maintaining a stem cell pool and in paneth cell differentiation .
we demonstrate that the wnt - reporter mouse can be used for in vivo analyses of both lineage tracing by detection of protein expression using immunohistochemistry and identification of wnt - activated cell populations by reporter rna expression .
importantly , our studies validate the use of the wnt - reporter mouse ( topgal and batgal ) for detection of in vivo manipulation of wnt signaling in response to intestinal epithelial injury .

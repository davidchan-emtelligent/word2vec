despite the prominent role of executive functions in children 's emerging competencies , there remains debate regarding the structure and development of executive functions .
in an attempt to reconcile these discrepancies , a differentiation model of executive function development was evaluated in the early years using 6 - month age groupings .
specifically , 281 preschoolers completed measures of working memory , inhibition , and shifting .
results contradicted suggestions that executive functions follow a single trajectory of progressive separation in childhood , instead suggesting that these functions may undergo a period of integration in the preschool years .
these results highlight potential problems with current practices and theorizing in executive function research .
executive function preschool inhibition working memory shifting cognitive development introduction integral to a child 's cognitive development is an increasing ability to activate , coordinate , and manipulate information in mind .
current formulations suggest that this is made possible by the capacity and control of attention , which are supported by an executive control network ( consisting of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate , supplementary motor area , and basal ganglia ; rothbart and posner , 2001 ) .
in this context , the capacity of attention regards the maximum amount of information that concurrently can be activated within the focus of attention [ often termed working memory ( wm ) capacity ; shipstead et al. , 2012 ] .
in contrast , control processes direct the focus of attention toward task - relevant information ( e.g. , shifting ) and away from task - irrelevant information ( e.g. , inhibition ; shipstead et al. , 2012 ) .
these processes are routinely bundled as executive functions ( diamond , 2006 ) , given their role in enabling , constraining , directing , and supporting complex cognition .
although the exact course of executive function development remains debated , research suggests that they do not reach maturity until adolescence ( best et al. , 2009 ) .
the development of executive functions appears to play a prominent role in children 's emerging academic , social , emotional , and behavioral competencies .
for instance , research indicates that children 's executive functioning is related to preparedness for school ( blair and razza , 2007 ; welsh et al. , 2010 ) .
academically , superior executive functioning is associated with an early literacy and numeracy advantage ( blair and razza , 2007 ) , which longitudinal evidence indicates is maintained through at least the first 3 years of schooling ( bull et al. , 2008 ) .
in fact , early executive functioning predicts learning more generally , across a range of domains ( bull et al. , 2008 ) .
individual differences in executive functions also predict children 's social and emotional development ( e.g. , social understanding , moral conduct ; riggs et al. , 2006 ) .
the critical role of executive functions in development is further apparent in evidence that deficient executive functioning is often found in a range of developmental disorders ( e.g. , adhd ; willcutt et al. , 2005 ) .
research thus highlights broad implications of children 's executive function development , which appears to set the stage for a wide range of later developments .
the preschool years have been identified as a particularly crucial time in the emergence and development of executive functions .
the preschool period sees increases in wm capacity ( gathercole et al. , 2004 ) , as well as duration , and frequency of attentional focus ( kannass et al. , 2006 ) .
attentional control also displays rapid development in these formative years , with significant increases in the ability to resist distraction and overcome task - irrelevant pre - potent responding ( carlson , 2005 ; diamond , 2006 ) and a rapid increase in the ability to exercise control over shifts in attention ( carlson , 2005 ; zelazo , 2006 ) .
in fact , it has been suggested that development of executive functions in the preschool years may reflect a more qualitative change in cognitive function , whereas later developments reflect quantitative refinements and enhancements of these abilities ( best and miller , 2010 ) .
despite the integral role that executive functions play in normal and atypical development , there remains debate regarding the development and dissociation of these functions .
on the one hand , the fractionated nature of executive functions is supported by the extraction of multiple executive function factors using latent variable approaches ( although the quantity , composition , interpretation , and development of these factors is debated ; miyake et al. , 2000 ; klenberg et al. , 2001 ; lehto et al. , 2003 ; huizinga et al. , 2006 ) .
in contrast , the unitary nature of executive function is suggested by research indicating a single latent factor in early childhood ( wiebe et al. , 2008 , 2011 ; hughes et al. , 2010 ) .
in reconciling these discrepancies , it has been suggested that executive functions may in fact differ in structure across the preschool , primary , and adolescent years ( best and miller , 2010 ) .
for instance , there is evidence supporting the unity of executive functions in the preschool years ( tsujimoto et al. , 2007 ; wiebe et al. , 2008 , 2011 ; hughes et al. , 2010 ) , which fractionate in the primary school years ( remaining as related , yet dissociable functions into adulthood ; miyake et al. , 2000 ; lehto et al. , 2003 ; huizinga et al. , 2006 ) .
recent longitudinal factor analytic evidence provides further support for this developmental differentiation of executive functions ( brydges et al. , 2014 ) .
yet conflicting results continue to suggest the presence of multiple executive functions , even in the early years .
for instance , miller et al .
( 2012 ) found a two - factor structure ( i.e. , wm and inhibition ) of executive functions among preschoolers .
the longitudinal results of usai et al .
( 2014 ) also supported two executive function factors among 5 - and 6 - year old children , although they characterize these as wm and shifting .
given continued inconsistency in findings , it has been suggested that these discrepancies may be a product of : ( i ) the common practice of collapsing participants into overly large age bands , which may obscure rapid changes in the quality and structure of executive functions with increasing age ( e.g. , hughes , 1998 ; klenberg et al. , 2001 ; lehto et al. , 2003 ; wiebe et al. , 2008 ; miller et al. , 2012 ) ; and ( ii ) problematic selection of tasks and indices , which may preclude precision in measurement of young children 's executive functioning ( miller et al. , 2012 ) .
the current study thus sought to evaluate the proposed developmental differentiation model of executive functions ( tsujimoto et al. , 2007 ; brydges et al. , 2014 ) in the preschool years , using well - established measures and narrower age intervals than have previous studies ( i.e. , 6 months ) .
specifically , cross - sectional analyses within each age band were used to examine relationships between executive functions ( i.e. , wm , inhibition , and shifting ) .
given the model 's hypothesis of undifferentiated executive functioning among preschoolers , yet the developmental differentiation of executive functions with increasing age , it was expected that executive functions would remain highly related in each age group but would display gradual differentiation as age increased .
materials and methods participants participants were 281 children aged 3 - 4 years ( m = 4.11 , sd = 0.59 ) .
participants were recruited from 11 australian preschool centers managed by a not - for - profit organization .
data from one participant was excluded due to early withdrawal resulting in fewer than 50 % of tasks being completed .
the final sample consisted of 55 younger 3 - year olds ( range = 3.00 - 3.49 years ; m = 3.28 , sd = 0.15 ) , 70 older 3 - year olds ( range = 3.50 - 3.99 years ; m = 3.74 , sd = 0.14 ) , 78 younger 4 - year olds ( range = 4.00 - 4.49 years ; m = 4.23 , sd = 0.14 ) , and 77 older 4 - year olds ( range = 4.50 - 4.99 years ; m = 4.73 , sd = 0.14 ) .
fifty - two percent of participants were girls ( n = 155 ) , with a relatively even distribution of boys and girls within each age band .
all children were native speakers of english .
parental consent , as well as the child 's verbal assent , was collected as a condition of participation .
measures backward word span the backward word span task ( based on the protocols of davis and pratt , 1995 ) , designed to measure the maximum number of items that concurrently can be activated and manipulated in wm , has been used extensively with preschoolers ( davis and pratt , 1995 ; carlson , 2005 ) .
previous research has found good test - retest reliability with this task ( muller et al. , 2012 ) .
this task requires participants to repeat a sequence of spoken words in reverse order .
the task began with instructions and demonstration using a three - stimulus practice item combining visual and verbal presentation .
this was followed by 3 two - stimulus , verbal - only practice trials .
successful completion of at least one practice trial resulted in the child progressing through tests lists of increasing length ( i.e. , two trials at each of two , three and four stimuli list lengths ) .
the task was discontinued whenever a child was unable to correctly reverse at least one of the two trials within a given list length .
scores , which could range from 0 to 7 , reflect the highest list length at which the child was able to complete at least one trial .
if the child failed to correctly reverse a list length of two , they were assigned a score of one if they could correctly recite the two - stimulus item in unreversed order ( carlson , 2005 ) .
dimensional change card sort ( dccs ) the dimensional change card sort ( dccs ; based on protocols of zelazo , 2006 ) , a measure of shifting , has been used extensively with preschool - aged children ( zelazo , 2006 ; miller et al. , 2012 ) , with research suggesting good test - retest reliability of this task ( beck et al. , 2011 ) .
to start , the initial pre - switch condition required children to sort cards ( i.e. , red rabbits , blue boats ) by a randomly selected sorting dimension ( color or shape ) into one of two boxes ( identified by a blue rabbit or a red boat ) .
after one demonstration trial and two practice trials , the tester then only reiterated the relevant sorting rule as they presented test trial cards .
in the post - switch phase , children were required to sort cards by the other sorting dimension .
the tester again began each trial by reiterating the relevant sorting rule and then presented a card for sorting .
if the child correctly sorted at least five of the six post - switch cards , they proceeded to the border phase of the task .
in this phase , children were required to sort by color if the card had a black border or sort by shape if the card had no black border .
after a demonstration trial and two practice trials , the tester again reiterated the sorting rule prior to presenting a test card for sorting .
for all conditions , cards were ordered such that a particular stimulus was never presented more than twice in a row .
scores , which could range from 0 to 12 , represent the number of correct card sorts after the pre - switch phase .
go / no - go ( gng ) the go / no - go paradigm has been used extensively to measure inhibition in preschool - aged children ( miller et al. , 2012 ; wiebe et al. , 2012 ) , with previous research indicating acceptable test - retest reliability of gng paradigms ( willoughby and blair , 2011 ) .
the current variant ( following the protocols of wiebe et al. , 2012 ) required participants to ' catch fish ' by pressing a computer key and ' avoid sharks' by withholding this response. that the majority of stimuli were fish potentiated the ' go ' response and required interruption of this response on ' no - go ' trials .
the task was introduced in the following sequence : instructions for fish , followed by five consecutive ' go ' practice trials ; instructions for sharks , followed by five consecutive ' no - go ' practice trials ; then a recap of instructions , followed by a mixed block of 10 practice trials ( eight fish , two sharks ) .
feedback was provided for all practice trials .
the task proceeded in three mixed blocks of 25 stimuli , each consisting of 80 % go trials .
a block design was used to provide participants with a short break before having to refocus their attention .
stimuli were presented in random order for 1500 ms each , followed by a 1000 ms interval between stimuli. between each test block , the tester reiterated rules for responding .
scores , which could range from 0 to 100 % , represent proportional accuracy on no - go trials .
procedure all children were administered this battery of executive function tasks in the following order : wm ( backward word span ) , shifting ( dccs ) , and inhibition ( gng ) .
to optimize children 's attention and engagement , all tasks were administered individually in a single 30 - minute testing session , in a quiet area of the child 's preschool .
when necessary , short breaks were used to maintain children 's interest and attention .
results initial data screening indicated that some participants displayed problematic patterns of gng responding .
individual blocks were removed for cases of indiscriminant responding ( go trials : > 80 % accuracy , no - go trials < 20 % accuracy ) or non - responsiveness ( go trials : < 20 % accuracy , no - go trials : > 80 % accuracy ) .
data was also removed if the child was unable to understand task requirements ( e.g. , when instructed to say words backward , they responded ' backward ') .
this resulted in 6.2 % of data being unavailable ( due to early withdrawal ) or removed , the distribution of which was fairly consistent across the age groups ( ranging from 3.4 % for the younger 4 - year olds to 8.4 % for the younger 3 - year olds ) .
after this screening process , no extreme observations were noted ( defined as greater than 3 sds from the mean ) .
all unavailable and removed data was treated as missing data in subsequent analyses .
to evaluate the hypothesis of the undifferentiated executive functioning of preschool - aged children , two - step hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed , regressing age and scores for two executive function measures on scores for the third executive function measure ( for similar analyses in the early primary school years , see tsujimoto et al. , 2007 ) .
to maximize statistical power , these analyses were conducted separately for 3 - year olds and 4 - year olds ( although see table 1 for inter - task correlations for 6 - month age groups ) .
altogether , three multiple regression analyses were run for each age group , each of which used a different executive function measure as the dependent variable ( see figure 1 for presentation of these results as path diagrams ) .
contrary to our hypotheses , results indicated that performance on each executive function task was significantly predicted by performance on all other tasks for the 4 - year old group ( standardized betas ranged from 0.17 to 0.21 ) , yet there were no significant paths in the 3 - year old group ( standardized betas ranged from 0.02 to 0.18 ) .
in order to statistically compare the regression coefficients between the age groups , subsequent analyses re - ran these regression analyses for the full sample , adding an interaction term ( the product of group and executive function task score ) to evaluate the null hypothesis that regression weights of the 3 - and 4 - year old groups were equivalent .
results indicated significance of the interaction term when regressing inhibition and shifting on wm ( ps < 0.05 ) , but non - significance when regressing shifting on inhibition ( and vice versa ) .
this indicates a significant difference between the age groups for all but the shifting - inhibition paths .

working memory ( wm ) was indexed by a backward word span task .
shifting was indexed by a dimensional change card sorting ( dccs ) task .
inhibition was indexed by a go / no - go ( gng ) task .
to further examine the development of preschoolers' executive functioning , analyses of variance compared the performance of participants separated into 6 - month age bands ( i.e. , younger 3 - year olds , older 3 - year olds , younger 4 - year olds , older 4 - year olds ) .
descriptive statistics for these groups are provided in table 2 .
anovas yielded main effects of age for all tasks : backward word span , f ( 3,250 ) = 7.62 , p < 0.001 , eta2 = 0.11 ; dccs , f ( 3,277 ) = 11.25 , p < 0.001 , eta2 = 0.11 ; and gng , f ( 3,265 ) = 3.24 , p = 0.023 , eta2 = 0.04 .
post hoc analyses indicated that for the backward word span task , older 4 - year olds outperformed all other age groups .
for dccs , older 4 - year olds outperformed 3 - year olds and younger 4 - year olds outperformed younger 3 - year olds .
for gng , older 4 - year olds scored higher than younger 3 - year olds ( for presentation of these scores as standardized patterns of change , see figure 2 ). of note is the increased precision gained by analyzing differences across smaller age bands , compared to analyses using 1 - year age bands ( which indicated significant difference between 3 - and 4 - year olds , ps < 0.05 ) .

this model of executive function development predicts highly related performance across wm , inhibition , and shifting tasks in the preschool years .
it further suggests that the relationships between executive functions should gradually weaken with age into adulthood , coinciding with the fractionation of executive functions into related , dissociable functions .
the current study sought to evaluate these predictions using well - established measures of executive functioning and more precise age groups than have previous studies .
in contrast to this model of undifferentiated executive functioning becoming increasingly differentiated with age , however , current results suggest that young preschoolers' executive function task performance was largely unrelated ( evidenced by independence of executive components in multiple regression analyses ) .
the executive functions of the older preschoolers , in contrast , were increasingly related ( evidenced by increasing strength of inter - task correlations and multiple regression analyses indicating that all executive components were significantly related ) .
this suggests that a single developmental trajectory toward increasing differentiation of executive functions may be insufficient to fully explain the early development of executive functioning .
current results highlight the potential pitfalls of collapsing participants into overly large age groups when investigating the development of executive function , especially in the preschool years .
this loss of precision in measurement may explain why some factor analytic studies of executive functions in the preschool years yield multiple distinct factors .
for instance , miller et al. ' s ( 2012 ) collapsing of large age groups ( i.e. , 3 - 5 year olds ) , whose executive functions may have differed in structure according to current results , may have obscured an accurate picture of preschoolers' executive function development .
although wiebe et al .
( 2011 ) found similar evidence for a one - factor model of executive function using finer age groupings ( i.e. , 3 - year olds ) , it is notable that their two - factor model actually provided marginally better fit to their data ( a one - factor model was chosen on the basis of providing similarly good model fit , yet enhanced parsimony ) .
these issues are further exacerbated by differences in the executive functions modeled , tasks selected , and the selection of performance indicators .
for instance , mcauley and white 's ( 2011 ) finding of a stable organization of executive functions from early childhood - which contrasts evidence of the increasing fractionation of these functions - may have been influenced by the inclusion of a processing speed factor ( a less conventional addition , with many studies instead including a ' shifting ' factor ) and the ages combined for their early childhood ( 6 - 8 year olds ) , late childhood ( 9 - 12 year olds ) , adolescence ( 13 - 17 year olds ) , and young adulthood samples ( 18 - 24 year olds ) .
our anova results provide further evidence advocating for adopting finer age groupings in developmental studies. that is , our finding that older 4 - year olds tended to outperform the younger and older 3 - year olds contrasts re - analysis of the data using 1 - year age bands , which suggested that the 4 - year old group outperformed the 3 - year old group .
although there have already been efforts to elucidate the developmental trajectories of distinct executive functions ( best and miller , 2010 ) , and even executive function measures ( carlson , 2005 ) , our results suggest that these efforts would benefit from adopting similarly fine age groups ( in order to consider not only quantitative increases in performance , but also potential qualitative changes in the structure of executive functions ) .
this is likely especially important in the early years , given the rapid development of executive functions occurring in this period .
a precise picture of the developmental trajectories of the different executive functions is important not only for advances in theory , but also for identifying ages at which individual executive functions are most susceptible to intervention ( whether positive or negative ) .
for instance , it may be that function - specific strategies ( e.g. , chunking the contents of wm ) are optimally effective only after fractionation in the primary years .
the current results thus contrast a model of initially undifferentiated executive functioning , which fractionates into discrete yet related executive functions .
specifically , current results suggest that preschoolers' executive functioning may initially present as unrelated processes , yet undergo a period of integration in the preschool years .
this suggestion is consistent with longitudinal evidence of increasing correlations between executive function tasks across the preschool years ( hughes , 1998 ) .
in fact , this period of integration may extend into the early primary years , as suggested by tsujimoto et al .
( 2007 ) findings that executive functions were more strongly related in early - primary school students ( 5 - 6 years of age ) than in later - primary school students ( 8 - 9 years of age ) .
it thus may be the case that , after early integration in the preschool and early primary years , executive functions begin to fractionate in the later primary school years .
if so , this would explain why many factor analytic studies of children 's executive functioning in the late preschool and early primary years yield a single executive function factor ( hughes et al. , 2010 ; welsh et al. , 2010 ; wiebe et al. , 2011 ) , whereas multiple executive functions are typically extracted in factor analytic studies with older children and adults ( miyake et al. , 2000 ; klenberg et al. , 2001 ; lehto et al. , 2003 ; huizinga et al. , 2006 ) .
in fact , garon et al. ' s ( 2008 ) synthesis of executive function studies in the preschool years led them to conclude , " before 3 years of age , basic skills needed for component [ executive functions ] emerge , whereas development after age 3 appears to be an integrative period in which basic skills become coordinated " ( p. 53 ) .
however , whether this period of early integration is related to variation in executive functions ( increasing integration of executive function processes ) or contributing non - executive abilities ( e.g. , problem solving strategies ) is an area requiring further investigation .
although the current study provides unique evidence toward reconciling existing debates in the executive function literature , interpretation of these results must be considered in light of the cross - sectional nature of the data and the limited number of tasks used to collect these data. that is , although the strongest analyses appropriate for our data were applied , the cross - sectional nature of the data did not allow for hierarchical linear modeling , which would have permitted statistical comparison of the developmental trajectories of each executive function .
nevertheless , standardized cross - sectional trends in the current data were relatively consistent across the three executive functions ( as would be expected if these functions are becoming increasingly integrated ) .
a further limitation of this study was the adoption of only a single indicator of each function , which conflates ability - specific and task - specific variance ( a task impurity issue ) and precludes latent variable analyses .
for instance , strengthening inter - task correlations may be a product of maturation or performance strategies ( among other possible explanations ) .
in the current study , however , that inter - task correlations were largely maintained after controlling for age suggests that these results cannot be solely ascribed to general cognitive maturation .
although possibly divergent performance strategies cannot be similarly accounted for in the current data , it has been suggested that acquisition and deployment of different strategies mirrors developmental change in underlying neural systems ( tsujimoto et al. , 2007 ) .
even differential strategy adoption may thus signal the integration or fractionation of executive functions .
nevertheless , longitudinal research that adopts multiple indices of each executive function is required to further substantiate this initial evidence of early executive function development .
conclusion the current data provide evidence to contrast the model of initially undifferentiated executive functioning , which fractionates into discrete yet related executive functions .
the current data provide evidence that the preschool years may be a period of integration of initially unrelated executive processes , rather than a unified executive resource in the early preschool years .
our findings also highlight the need to consider the potentially changing nature and structure of young children 's executive functioning , prior to collapsing preschool - aged children into a single ' homogeneous' group .
such methods , while common , may serve to obscure genuine developmental trends and further complicate , rather than clarify , issues under investigation .

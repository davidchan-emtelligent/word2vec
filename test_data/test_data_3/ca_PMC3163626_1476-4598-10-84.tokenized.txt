background although integrins have been implicated in the progression of breast cancer , the exact mechanism whereby they exert this regulation is clearly not understood .
to understand the role of integrins in breast cancer , we examined the expression levels of several integrins in mouse breast cancer cell lines by flow cytometry and the data were validated by western and rt - pcr analysis .
the importance of integrins in cell migration and cell invasion was examined by in vitro assays .
further the effect of integrins on metastasis was investigated by in vivo experimental metastasis assays using mouse models .
results integrin alpha5 subunit is highly expressed in the nonmetastatic cell line 67nr and is significantly low in the highly invasive cell line 4t1 .
in contrast , expression levels of integrin alpha6 subunit are high in 4t1 cells and low in 67nr cells .
in vitro data indicated that overexpression of alpha5 subunit and knockdown of alpha6 integrin subunit inhibited cell proliferation , migration , and invasion .
our in vivo findings indicated that overexpression of integrin alpha5 subunit and knockdown of alpha6 subunit decreased the pulmonary metastasis property of 4t1 cells .
our data also indicated that overexpression of alpha 5 integrin subunit and suppression of alpha6 integrin subunit inhibited cells entering into s phase by up - regulating p27 , which results in downregulation of cycline / cdk2 complexes , this suggests that these integrins regulate cell growth through their effects on cell - cycle - regulated proteins .
we also found that modulation of these integrins upregulates e2f , which may induce the expression of chk1 to regulate cdc25a / cyclin e / cdk2 / rb in a feedback loop mechanism .
conclusion this study indicates that integrin alpha5 subunit functions as a potential metastasis suppressor , while alpha6 subunit functions as a metastasis promoter .
the modulation of integrins reduces cdc25 a , another possible mechanism for downregulation of cdk2 .
taken together we demonstrate a link between integrins and the chk1 - cdc25 - cyclin e / cdk2 - rb pathway .
background tumor metastasis is a highly complex multistep process involving unregulated cell growth , cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions , cell adhesion , angiogenesis , and growth of new cancer colonies [ 1 ] .
during these steps , the expression level of some genes is altered .
thus , these genes , once identified , can serve as bio - markers of metastatic diagnosis and prognosis .
over the past decade , a variety of genes have been identified that are altered in tumor growth and metastasis [ 2 ] .
integrins are a family of transmembrane glycoprotein adhesion receptors that mediate cell - matrix and cell - cell adhesion .
they are the main receptors for sensing the extracellular environment of the cell [ 3 ] .
integrins form heterodimers of alpha and beta subunits [ 4 ] .
eighteen alpha subunits and eight beta subunits can associate to form 24 unique integrin heterodimers .
numerous studies have shown that in addition to sensing the extracellular environment , integrins are involved in various intracellular pathways , including cell adhesion , migration , polarity , survival , growth and death [ 3,5,6 ] , suggesting their important role in cancer [ 4 ] .
furthermore , integrins were shown to be differentially expressed during tumor growth and progression , making them potential targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy [ 3,5,6 ] .
the mechanisms whereby integrins function in tumor cells are yet to be determined .
however , some cancer - related proteins , such as focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) [ 7 ] and nischarin [ 8 ] can bind to and interact with integrins .
therefore , we investigated whether integrins are differentially expressed in highly metastatic cells compared with non - metastatic cells , and examined the effect of these differentially expressed integrins on cell proliferation , invasion and the potential of metastasis .
in this study we used mouse breast cancer cell lines 4t1 , 4t07 , and 67nr because they represent a good model for the study of breast cancer metastasis .
4t1 , 4t07 , and 67nr are derived from the same balb / c mammary tumor and are highly tumorigenic , but vary in their metastatic potential .
4t1 widely disseminates , resulting in secondary tumors in the lung , liver , bone , and brain ; 4t07 spreads to the lung and liver but cannot establish metastatic nodules ; 67nr does not metastasize [ 9,10 ] .
our study shows that integrin alpha5 subunit functions as a candidate metastasis suppressor , while alpha6 subunit promotes tumor metastasis in 4t1 cell lines through the modulation of pathways regulated by the cell cycle .
materials and methods cell lines mouse mammary carcinoma cells 4t1 , 4t07 , and 67nr were cultured in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) .
cells were incubated at 37degreesc with 5 % ( w / v ) co2 and 95 % ( w / v ) air mixture .
flow cytometry one million 4t1 , 4t07 , and 67nr cells were incubated with primary antibodies against integrins alpha4 ( clone ps / 2 ) , alpha5 ( clone 5h10 - 27 ) , alpha6 ( clone nki - goh3 ) , beta1 ( clone mb1.2 ) , beta2 ( clone m18 / 2 ) , alpha2beta1 ( clone bma2.1 ) , alpha5beta1 ( clone bma5 ) , and alphavbeta6 ( clone 10d5 ) for 30 min at 4degreesc in phosphate - buffered saline containing 1 % fbs .
cells were then washed twice with ice - cold pbs and incubated with fitc - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1:1,250 ) for 30 min at 4degreesc .
most antibodies were purchased from millipore ( madison , wi ) ; the exception was integrin alpha5 , which was purchased from abcam ( cambridge , ma ) .
relative amounts of cell surface integrins were determined using a facscan cytometer with cellquest software ( becton - dickinson , san jose , ca ) .
rt - pcr total rnas from these cell lines were isolated using a rneasy kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) .
rna quality was determined with the agilent bioanalyser 2100 and rna nano 6000 labchip kit ( agilent technologies , palo alto , ca ) .
rna concentrations were determined with a nanodrop apparatus ( nanodrop technologies ) .
rt - pcr was done to confirm expression of integrins alpha5 and alpha6 by one - step rt - pcr ( qiagen ) .
briefly , the 25 mul rt - pcr reaction included 100 ng total rna , 5 mul 5 x rt - pcr buffer , 0.4 mm dntp , 0.6 mum forward and reverse primers , and 1 mul enzyme mix .
the reactions were incubated in a 96 - well plate at 50degreesc for 30 min and 95degreesc for 15 min , followed by 25 cycles of 95degreesc for 15 sec , 60degreesc for 30 sec , 72degreesc for 30 s , and 72degreesc for 7 min .
the primers used in rt - pcr were : for integrin alpha5 : forward : 5 ' - ggaccaagacggctacaatgatgt - 3 ' ; reverse : 5 ' - acctgggaaggtttagtgctcagt - 3 ' .
for integrin alpha6 : forward : 5 ' - aaagagacatgaagtccgcgcatc - 3 ' ; reverse : 5 ' - aacaatgtcttgccacccatctgc - 3 ' .
for chk1 : forward : 5 ' - tggacaaactggttcagggcat - 3 ' ; reverse : 5 ' - tgctcacaacatcgctgagctt - 3 ' .
for e2f1 : forward : 5 ' - acccagggaaaggtgtgaaa - 3 ' ; reverse : 5 ' - aaagcagttgcagctgtgtggt - 3 ' .
for gapdh forward : 5 ' - aacatcatccctgcatccactggt - 3 ' ; reverse : 5 ' - tgttgaagtcgcaggagacaacct - 3 ' .
the rt - pcr products were determined by electrophoresis on 2 % agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide .
western blotting cells were washed twice using ice cold pbs .
cell lysates were prepared using ripa buffer ( 50 mm tris , ph 7.5 ; 1 % np - 40 ; 0.1 % sodium deoxycholate ; 150 mm nacl ; 50 mm naf ; and 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate ) .
lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min at 4degreesc .
small aliquots ( 10 mul ) of the supernatant were used for determining protein concentrations by a bicinchonic acid assay ( pierce ; rockford , il ) .
proteins ( 20 - 50 mug ) were separated by sds - polyacrylamide electrophoresis on 6 % or 12 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred to pvdf membranes ( ge healthcare biosciences , piscataway , nj ) .
blots were blocked in 5 % milk and 0.1 % tris - buffered saline - tween 20 for 1 hr at room temperature .
blots were incubated with antibodies against integrin alpha5 subunit ( 1:1000 ; millipore , madison , wi ) and integrin alpha6 subunit ( 1:500 ; santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , ca ) .
membranes were washed 4x for 5 min each time using pbs tween 20 and incubated with anti - mouse or anti - rabbit horseradish - peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1:2,000 ; santa cruz biotechnology ) .
detection of the signal was done using an ecl immunoblotting detection system ( ge healthcare biosciences ) .
construction of stable cell lines overexpressing integrin alpha5 and knockdown integrin alpha6 we used the expression plasmid pcdna 3.1 / itga5 , which contains the full length of integrin alpha5 subunit , to transfect 4t1 cells by the lipofectamine 2000 method ( life technologies , rockville , md ) .
the transfected cells were subjected to 1 mg / ml g418 selection .
several g418 - resistant clones were tested for integrin alpha5 subunit overexpression .
the mixture of positive clones was used for further studies .
two integrin alpha6 subunit oligos were designed by selecting appropriate sequences from the mouse integrin alpha6 gene ( nm _ 008397 ) and named shrna - 1 and shrna - control .
the sequences of the two shrnas were as follows : shrna - : 5 ' - gatccccccttgtacacggattgaatttcaagagaatt caatccgtgtacaaggttttta - 3 ' ; shrna - control : 5 ' - gatccccggacaacgtgatccggaa attcaagagatttccggatcacgttgtccttttta - 3 ' the double strands for shrna - 1 and shrna - control oligos were cloned into genescript shrna expression vector , prnat - h1.1 / neo ( cat # sd1213 - genescript , nj ) , using the bamh1 and hindiii restriction enzyme sites .
the oligo insertion was confirmed by sequencing .
after plasmid transfection , cells were cultured in g - 418 ( 500 ug / ml ) and several clones were isolated .
the individual clones were characterized and positive clones were selected rt - pcr and western blot analysis .
cell proliferation analysis to examine cell proliferation , we used mtt calorimetry assays ( millipore , madison , wi ) .
cells were harvested , resuspended , and plated in 96 - well plates at 1 x 103 cells per well in 100 mul of cell culture medium and maintained at 37degreesc in a humidified incubator containing 5 % co2 .
after every 24 h , 10 mul of the mtt solution was added to the triplicate wells and incubated at 37degreesc for another 4 h. also , 100 mul of color development solution was added and incubated for 10 min to dissolve the crystal completely .
then we measured the absorbance at 572 nm , using a plate reader to calculate the numbers of vital cells in each well .
cell migration and cell invasion analysis in vitro cell migration and invasion assays were done as per our previously reported protocols [ 8,11 ] .
briefly , 4t1 ( control ) , 4t1 - gfp , 4t1 - alpha5 , or 4t1 - alpha6.shrna1 cells ( 1 x 105 ) were suspended in 100 mul of serum - free dmem and added on top of the transwell ( 8.0 mum pore size ; corning , ny ) chambers ( for migration ) or on top of the matrigel - coated transwells ( 30 mul of serum - free dmem - diluted matrigel ; bd biosciences , san jose , ca ) ( for invasion ) in triplicate .
the dmem plus 10 % fbs culture medium was added to the lower chamber to serve as a chemoattractant .
after 6 h ( migration ) or 24 h ( invasion ) of incubation at 37degreesc , the upper surfaces of the filters were carefully wiped with a cotton - tipped applicator .
the filters were fixed with 4 % paraforrmaldehyde in pbs and stained with 0.1 % crystal violet solution .
in some cases , cell migration was performed either on fibronectin or laminin matrices .
cells that had migrated or invaded ( matrigel ) through the transwell filter pores toward the lower surface of the filters were counted in five different fields under a light microscope .
cell cycle analysis 4t1 ( control ) , 4t1 - gfp , 4t1 - alpha5 , and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells were stained for dna content as per our previously described protocols [ 12 ] .
briefly , cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 200 mul ice - cold pbs , after which 4 ml of cold 70 % ethanol was added to the mixture .
cells were incubated at 4degreesc for 45 min .
subsequently , cells were centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min at 4degreesc and resuspended in pi master mix , consisting of propidium iodide 40 ug / ml and rnase 100 ug / ml ( sigma ) at 37degreesc for 30 min .
cells were then analyzed using an lsr ii cytometer .
pi staining intensity was determined by modfit software .
cell - cycle genes pcr array total rna was extracted and measured as previously described [ 12 ] .
rna was used to probe ge arrays containing cell - cycle - related genes as per the manufacturer 's recommendations ( superarray bioscience ) .
raw data were normalized by gearray analyzer software .
data were normalized with control groups ( 4t1 - alpha5 data normalized with 4t1 - gfp and 4t1 alpha6 - 1 data normalized with 4t1 control shrna ) .
in - vivo metastasis assay twenty five nude mice ( nci ) were maintained as per the guidelines of the aalac and the iacuc lsu health sciences center at new orleans .
these mice were randomly allocated to five groups for tail vein injections of 4t1 control , 4t1 - gfp , 4t1 - alpha5 , or 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells .
cells were grown to 80 % confluency and harvested in cold pbs .
1 x 106 cells in 0.1 ml pbs were injected into nude mice via lateral tail vein injection .
these mice were then used in the following experiments , each of which was repeated three times .
immunohistochemistry after 4 weeks , mice were euthanized .
their lungs were removed and perfused with buffered formalin through the cannulated trachea .
paraffin wax sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) and ki67 using standard procedures , and the sections were examined by light microscopy .
india ink lung staining at 4 weeks after tail vein injection , mice were sacrificed and india ink ( 15 %) was injected into their lungs through the trachea .
the lungs were fixed in fekete 's solution ( 100 ml of 70 % alcohol , 10 ml formalin , and 5 ml glacial acetic acid ) at room temperature .
after destaining , the lungs were photographed .
statistical analysis every experiment was repeated at least three times and statistical analysis was performed by one way anova using jmp5.0 software ( sas inc , cary , nc ) .
fisher 's lsd post - hoc test was applied to assess differences of expression levels between each cell type .
a value of p <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results in 4t1 cells integrin alpha5 subunit levels are low and integrin alpha6 subunit levels are high since integrins are thought to have a major role in regulating tumor growth and metastasis , we examined the expression levels of integrins in highly invasive ( 4t1 and 4t07 ) and noninvasive ( 67nr ) mouse breast cancer cells .
using facs analysis , we measured the expression levels of 7 integrins , alpha4 , alpha5 , alpha6 , beta1 , beta2 , alpha2beta1 , and alphavbeta6 .
our results showed that integrin alpha5 subunit levels were lowest in 4t1 , moderate in 4t07 , and highest in 67nr cells ( figure 1a ) .
in contrast , integrin alpha6 subunit expression was highest in 4t1 , moderate in 4t07 , and lowest in 67nr cells ( additional file 1 , figure 1b ) .
expression of the other integrins ( alpha4 , beta1 , beta2 , alpha2beta1 , alphavbeta6 ) was very low in these cell lines ( additional file 1 ) .
rt - pcr and western blot analysis validated the different levels of expression of integrin subunits alpha5 and alpha6 in 4t1 , 4t07 , and 67nr cells ( figure 2a , b ) .
these findings suggest that the alpha5 and alpha6 integrins may have a critical role in tumor growth and metastasis .
figure 1 flow cytometric analysis of integrins .
analysis was performed for integrin alpha5 ( a ) and alpha6 ( b ) on mouse breast cancer cell lines 4t1 ( control ) , as well as 4t07 and 67nr .
the fluorescence signals of unstained cells ( primary antibody omitted ) for each cell type were presented as blue peaks and served as the basal level of cell - surface expression .
the fluorescence signal for integrin alpha5 and alpha6 subunits were presented as open peaks .
histograms presented the positive cell percentage of each cell type and the differences are statistically significant ( p < 0.01 ) .
all experiments were repeated three times .
figure 2 validation of expression of integrins by rt - pcr and western blot analysis .
expression levels of integrin alpha5 ( a ) and alpha6 subunits ( b ) were validated by rt - pcr and western blotting .
rt - pcr was done using the integrin alpha5 - and alpha6 - specific primers .
gapdh was used as the loading control .
cell lysates were prepared and western blotted with anti - integrin alpha5 or anti - integrin alpha6 antibody .
vinculin blotting was used for equal loading .
integrin alpha5 overexpression ( c ) and alpha6 knockdown ( d ) were also validated by rt - pcr and western blot .
stable cell lines overexpressing integrin alpha5 and knockdown alpha6 were established .
rna and protein lysates were used to demonstrate the expression of the plasmids .
to investigate the potential role of integrin subunits alpha5 and alpha6 on tumor cell invasion and metastasis of 4t1 cells , we stably transfected these cells with full - length cdna for mouse integrin alpha5 subunit and prnat - h1.1 / neo , which contained the shrna - control or shrna - 1 for mouse integrin alpha6 subunit .
4t1 - gfp was also used as a control .
mixtures of g418 resistant clones from these stable transfections were tested for the integration of integrin alpha5 subunit overexpression and integrin alpha6 subunit knockdown by rt - pcr and western blot analyses .
our findings demonstrate that the expression levels of integrin alpha5 in the transfected cells increased as compared with levels in controls ( figure 2c ) .
for integrin alpha6 subunit knockdown stable cells , both rt - pcr and western blot analyses demonstrated that shrna - 1 can efficiently target mouse integrin alpha6 mrna .
moreover , the expression level of alpha6 was significantly decreased ( figure 2d ) .
in contrast , shrna - control ( alpha6 - 2 ) did not affect integrin alpha6 subunit expression at either the rna or protein level ( figure 2d ) .
integrin alpha5 subunit overexpression and alpha6 subunit knockdown inhibit 4t1 cell proliferation since cell proliferation is an important regulator of tumor growth , we examined the potential roles of integrin alpha5 and alpha6 genes on cell growth .
we used 4t1 control , gfp - 4t1 , 4t1 - alpha5 , and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells and measured cell growth by the mtt method .
the proliferation curves of 4t1 control and 4t1 - gfp cells were quite similar at all time points ( figure 3a ) .
the in vitro proliferation ability of 4t1 cells was significantly inhibited at 48 hr by overexpression of integrin alpha5 subunit ( 0.30 +/ - 0.08 versus 0.61 +/ - 0.07 for 4t1 - alpha5 and 4t1 - gfp , respectively ; p < 0.01 ) and 96 hr ( 0.88 +/ - 0.14 versus 1.47 +/ - 0.09 for 4t1 - alpha5 and 4t1 - gfp , respectively ; p < 0.01 ) .
similarly , integrin alpha6 subunit knockdown had a significant inhibitory effect on 4t1 cell proliferation at 48 hr ( 0.41 +/ - 0.04 versus 0.61 +/ - 0.07 for 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 and 4t1 - gfp , respectively ; p < 0.01 ) and 96 hours ( 1.01 +/ - 0.21 versus 1.47 +/ - 0.09 , p < 0.01 ) ( figure 3a ) .
the effect of alpha6 knockdown on cell proliferation was not quite as robust as that of alpha5 overexpression .
however , alpha6 knockdown did significantly inhibit cell proliferation ( figure 3a ) .
these results suggest that overexpression of alpha5 and knockdown of alpha6 reduce cell growth in vitro .
figure 3 modulation of integrin expression inhibits cell proliferation , migration and invasion. a. cell proliferation of 4t1 cells .
4t1 control , 4t1 - gfp , 4t1 - alpha5 , and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells were seeded and mtt assays done at 24 - hr intervals .
mtt data were plotted based on the average absorbance value and standard deviation .
the y axis presents the absorbance at 572 nm ; the x axis represents incubation time .
black curve : 4t1 control ; red curve : 4t1 - gfp cells ; green curve : 4t1 - alpha5 cells ; blue curve : 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells .
** p < 0.01 ( as compared to gfp - 4t1 ) .
we found that the in - vitro proliferation ability of 4t1 cells is inhibited by overexpression of integrin alpha5 and knockdown of integrin alpha6. b. a transwell migration assay was done for 4t1 ( control ) , gfp - 4t1 , 4t1 - alpha5 , and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells .
the number of cells that migrated to the lower surface of the filter membrane was counted in 5 random fields under a light microscope ( x200 ) .
the ability of 4t1 cells to migrate was significantly diminished by overexpression of integrin alpha5 ( p < 0.01 ) and knockdown of 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 ( p < 0.05 ). c. representatives of cell migration figures for each cell type. d. a cell invasion assay was done for 4t1 , 4t1 - gfp , 4t1 - alpha5 , and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells .
0.1 % crystal violet solution was used to stain the lower chamber of transwell .
the number of cells that invaded the matrigel and penetrated the transwell pore to the lower surface was counted in 5 random fields under a light microscope ( x200 ) .
overexpression of integrin alpha5 and knockdown of alpha6 inhibited the ability of 4t1 cells to invade ( p < 0.01 ) .
integrin alpha5 subunit overexpression and alpha6 subunit knockdown inhibit 4t1 cell migration and cell invasion cell migration , a central process in the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms , has been shown to be involved in tumor formation and metastasis .
therefore , using the classic transwell in vitro cell migration assays , we investigated whether integrin alpha5 subunit overexpression and integrin alpha6 subunit knockdown affect the migration ability of 4t1 cells .
as shown in figure 3b and 3c , the in vitro migration ability of 4t1 - alpha5 cells was significantly decreased as compared to that of 4t1 control and 4t1 - gfp cells .
the numbers of migrated cells were 17.67 +/ - 1.0 , 49 +/ - 4.95 and 49 +/ - 1.86 , respectively , for 4t1 - alpha5 , 4t1 control , and 4t1 - gfp cells ( p < 0.01 ) .
similarly , the number of 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells ( 36.17 +/ - 8.25 ) that migrated through the transwell membrane was significantly lower than the number of 4t1 control cells ( 49 +/ - 4.95 ) and 4t1 - gfp cells ( 49 +/ - 1.86 ) that did so ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 3b , c ) .
furthermore , to define the functional changes of the integrins , migration of 4t1 and 67nr cells was carried out using either alpha5 integrin or alpha6 integrin functional antibodies .
as shown in additional file 2 , migration of 67nr cells ( that have high levels of alpha5 integrin ) was enhanced in the presence of alpha5 integrin blocking antibody , further suggesting alpha5 integrin suppresses cell migration .
also migration of 4t1 cells ( that have high levels of alpha6 integrin ) was decreased in the presence of alpha6 integrin blocking antibody ( additional file 2 ) .
cell invasion is an important regulator of tumor growth and metastasis .
to explore the functional effect of integrin alpha5 and alpha6 genes on the invasiveness of 4t1 cells , we did in vitro matrigel invasion assays on these cell lines .
our results showed that the numbers of 4t1 - alpha5 and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells that passed through the matrigel and transwell membrane were significantly lower than the number of cells in the 4t1 - gfp control group that did so , indicating that these integrins have important role in cell invasion ( figure 3d ) .
integrin alpha5 overexpression and alpha6 knockdown inhibit metastasis since alpha5 and alpha6 have dramatic effects on tumor cell migration and invasion , we hypothesized that these integrins may also have an effect on breast cancer metastasis .
thus we examined the effect of integrins on metastasis in vivo .
4t1 cells overexpressing alpha5 integrin subunit and alpha6 subunit underexpressing cells ( with their controls ) were injected into the tail veins of nude mice .
lung metastasis was examined four weeks later .
mice injected with 4t1 - alpha5 and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells showed a dramatic decrease in pulmonary metastases , while mice injected with 4t1 control and 4t1 - gfp cells produced many metastatic nodules ( figure 4ai , bi , ci , di ) .
when we dissected the lungs and filled them with 15 % india ink , the metastatic tumors , after fixation in fekete 's solution , appeared as white nodules on the black lung surface ( figure 4aii , bii , cii , dii ) .
h & e staining of the lungs of these mice showed that the presence of alpha5 and the reduction of alpha6 reduced lung metastases , while their controls had large numbers of metastases ( figure 4aiii , biii , ciii , diii ) .
in contrast , the lungs of mice injected with vector control cells were heavily infiltrated with metastases .
to our surprise 4t1 - alpha5 and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells did not have any effect on breast tumor growth , when we injected them into mammary fat pads ( data not shown ). , and the reasons for these results are currently unknown .
these data suggest that the alpha5 integrin subunit may function as a metastasis suppressor while alpha6 subunit may function as a metastasis promoter .
figure 4 overexpression of integrin alpha5 subunit and knock down of alpha6 subunit decreased pulmonary metastasis of 4t1 cells .
1 x 106 4t1 control , gfp - 4t1 , 4t1 - alpha5 , and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml pbs and used to inject nude mice in their lateral tail veins .
after four weeks , the mice were euthanized and their lungs were removed , fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , and analyzed for metastasis .
representative examples of the lung tissues from each group are shown .
a : lungs from 4t1 control - cell - injected mice ; b : lungs from 4t1 - gfp cells injected mice. , c : lungs from 4t1 - alpha5 injected mice. , d : lungs from mice injected with 4t1 alpha6 - shrna1 ; ai , bi , ci , and di : lung images taken right after formaldehyde fixation .
aii , bii , cii , and dii : lungs stained with india ink : .
aiii , biii , ciii , diii : h & e stained lung sections .
aiv , biv , civ , and div : ki67 stained lung sections .
scale bar : 100 microns .
our in vitro studies suggest that integrins have an effect on cell proliferation .
to investigate this in vivo , we did immunohistochemical analysis for ki67 , a marker for proliferation .
in the lungs of mice , altered integrin - expressing tumors had significantly less ki67 staining than they did in gfp - expressing controls ( figure 4aiv , biv , civ , div and quantitative data shown in additional file 3 ) , supporting a role for integrin alpha5 and alpha6 subunits in regulating tumor growth , in part through effects on cell proliferation .
as described , overexpression of integrin alpha5 and knockdown of integrin alpha6 subunits inhibited 4t1 cell proliferation ability .
since cell growth is regulated by positive and negative regulators of the cell cycle , we analyzed the effects of alpha5 integrin and alpha6 integrin subunits on cell - cycle progression and its associated proteins .
to understand the mechanism whereby integrin alpha5 and integrin alpha6 subunits affect cell proliferation , we examined the cell cycle using 4t1 control , 4t1 - gfp , 4t1 - alpha5 and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells .
to determine the effects on cell - cycle progression , we did flow cytometry using propidium iodide .
the alpha5 overexpression and knockdown of alpha6 integrin demonstrated a g1 / s arrest , which resulted in a decrease in the s - phase population ( figure 5a ) .
this suggested that overexpression of alpha5 integrin and knockdown of alpha6 integrin do not allow cells to pass the s phase .
as a result , these cells might have inhibited growth .
figure 5 modulation of integrins regulates cell cycle progression .
a : 4t1 , gfp - 4t1 , 4t1 - alpha5 , and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells were synchronized and stained with propidium iodide for cell - cycle analysis .
cells were arrested at g1 / s stage for 4t1 - alpha5 and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 ( 37 and 42 ) compared to controls ( 26 and 28 ) , and have shorter s phase for 4t1alpha5 and 4t1 alpha6 shrna ( 52 , 49 ) compared to controls ( 65 , 67 ) .
no significant changes in g2 phase were noted ( 4t1 alpha5:10 , 4t1 alpha6 - shrna1 ; 8 , 4t1 control : 8 , and 4t1 gfp : 7 ). b. rt - pcr data .
rna was isolated from all the four cell lines and rt - pcr was performed for e2f1 , chk1 , cyclin e and cdk2 .
gapdh control was used as a control .
gene expression level of cell - cycle - related genes to examine the mechanism by which alpha5 and alpha6 integrin subunits regulate cell - cycle progression , we did microarray analysis using a cell - cycle gene array containing cell - cycle genes ( sa biosciences ) .
cell - cycle microarray profiling was done using rna prepared from 4t1 - gfp , 4t1 - alpha5 , and 4t1 - alpha6.shrna1 cells to examine changes in cell - cycle - related genes .
we found that the expression of chk - 1 and e2f - 1 was elevated and cyclin e , cdk2 and cdc25a were decreased in 4t1 - alpha5 and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells compared to 4t1 - gfp cells ( additional file 4 ) .
later , we validated these data by rt - pcr ( figure 5b and data not shown ) .
although dst gene levels are significantly high in 4t1 - alpha5 and 4t1 - alpha6 - shrna1 cells , we were unable to validate the data by rt - pcr , and thus it is not further studied .
the results suggested that overexpression of alpha5 and knockdown of alpha6 reduces cell growth by enhancing the expression of chk1 and e2f1 and down regulating the expression of cyclin e and cdk2 .
downregulation of cyclin e / cdk2 complexes we analyzed the effects of integrin alpha5 subunit overexpression and alpha6 subunit knockdown on cell - cycle associated proteins , as shown in figure 6a , that cells overexpressing alpha5 integrin and alpha6 knock - down cells decreased the expression of cyclin e , but not cyclin - d. consistent with this finding , levels of cdk2 , a binding partner of cyclin e , also decreased in the cells .
however , no change in the level of cdk4 was observed .
these data corroborated the cell cycle array data and suggest that the integrins regulate cell growth through their effects on cell - cycle regulatory proteins .
because it is known that cdc25a regulates cdk2 / cyclin e , we examined whether modulation of integrin alpha5 and alpha6 subunits have any effect on cdc25a .
we found that both overexpression of alpha5 and knockdown of alpha6 downregulated the expression of cdc25a ( figure 6a ) , suggesting that inhibition of cdc25a may be a reason for downregulation of cdk2 and cyclin e. figure 6 modulation of integrin expression regulates expression of cell - cycle modulators known to induce g1 arrest. a. western blots show the expression of cyclin e , cdk2 , p27 , prb , chk1 , cdc25a , and e2f1 in 4t1 control , 4t1 gfp , 4t1 alpha5 overexpressing , and 4t1 alpha6 knocked - down cells .
b : our current model showing the mechanism of integrin modulation in breast cancer progression .
this model shows overexpression of integrin alpha5 or reduced expression of alpha6 causes upregulation of chk1 .
this , in turn , causes downregulation of cdk2 / cyclin e to reduce phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein .
this integrin modulation enhances the expression of e2f , which may stimulate chk1 expression , which regulates cdc25a function , in a feedback loop mechanism .
upregulation of chk1 and p27 expression we also examined the expression levels of cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors in the g1 / s phase , finding that the expression level of p27 was significantly increased ( figure 6a ) .
since our cell - cycle array data indicated that alpha5 overexpression and alpha6 integrin subunit - reduced expression caused upregulation of chk1 at the rna level , we examined the expression of chk1 at the protein level .
consistent with the rna data , protein expression levels were also increased , suggesting that chk1 upregulation could be another mechanism by which these integrins regulate metastasis .
rb phosphorylation is pivotal in controlling cell proliferation by upregulating the g1 / s transition of the cell cycle .
during the continuous proliferation of cells , prb is phosphorylated by the activity of g1 phase cdks such as cdk4 and cdk2 , thereby liberating factors that control the s - phase entrance .
consistent with our cyclin e / cdk2 data , these integrin modulations inhibited rb phosphorylation .
also , to our surprise , we found increased e2f1 levels in these integrin - modulated cells ( figure 6a ) , which is consistent with the cell - cycle array data .
these data suggest alpha5 and alpha6 integrin subunits regulate metastasis through their effects on cell cycle regulated proteins .
discussion in this investigation of the expression levels of 8 integrins on the surfaces of cells from mouse breast cancer cell lines 4t1 , 4t07 , and 67nr , only alpha5 and alpha6 integrin subunits showed changes in expression levels in different invasive cell types .
the alpha5 integrin subunit had the lowest expression in highly metastatic 4t1 cells , and little more in 4t07 ; its highest expression was in 67nr .
in contrast , integrin alpha6 had the opposite expression pattern , as compared to alpha5 subunit .
our results also showed that overexpression of integrin alpha5 subunit significantly inhibited 4t1 cell proliferation , cell migration , and cell invasion in vitro .
our cell - cycle data indicate that 4t1 - alpha5 cells were arrested at g1 / s phase and that a lesser number of cells entered into s phase .
also , our in vivo study showed that pulmonary metastasis of 4t1 - alpha5 cells was greatly decreased compared to metastasis of 4t1 and 4t1 - gfp cells .
based on these findings , we postulate that integrin alpha5 subunit functions as an inhibitor of metastasis in mouse breast cancer cell line 4t1 .
consistent with our data , lower expression levels of integrin alpha5 were observed in several cancerous tissues , including hepatocellular carcinoma [ 7,13 ] , prostate carcinoma [ 14 ] , and gastric , colorectal , and breast carcinoma [ 7 ] .
also previous reports indicated that overexpression of alpha5beta1 inhibits proliferation of human ht29 colon carcinoma cells in vitro and reduces the formation of lung colonies and cutaneous metastases in vivo [ 15,16 ] .
similarly , overexpression of integrin alpha5 in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells reduces cell proliferation , decreases cell colony formation , and changes the cell - cycle pattern [ 17 ] .
elevated levels of alpha5beta1 suppress the transformed phenotype of chinese hamster ovary cells [ 18 ] and reduce tumorigenesis in a mouse model [ 19 ] .
niu et al. found that the proliferation of k562 cells could be inhibited by ifnalpha - 2b by restoring the function of integrin alpha5 and beta1 and enhancing their ability to bind to fn , which in turn upregulates fak gene expression [ 20 ] .
there are , however , some contradicting reports showing that integrin alpha5 may function as an oncogene and is associated with malignant tumor progression .
survival analysis of non small - cell lung cancer patients with integrin alpha5 - overexpressing tumors had a worse overall survival rate than did patients whose tumors had normal integrin alpha5 expression [ 21 ] .
further , the integrin alpha5 molecule has been reported to promote melanoma metastasis in vitro and in vivo [ 22 ] .
integrin alpha5 up - regulation was identified as the molecular mechanism by which e - cadherin loss promotes tumor progression [ 23 ] and erbb2 - mediated transcriptional up - regulation of the alpha5beta1 promotes tumor cell survival under adverse conditions [ 24 ] .
thus , integrin alpha5 has different functions in different carcinoma cell lines .
the reasons for these diverse functions of integrin alpha5 in cancer progression and metastasis are still unclear ; however , it has been suggested that alpha5beta1 may affect different signaling cascades and might function differently depending on its adhesion or lack of adhesion to fibronectin [ 21 ] .
our results show that knockdown of integrin alpha6 subunit expression inhibited 4t1 cell proliferation , migration , and invasion .
consistent with these findings , the enhancement of cell migration and invasion by integrin alpha6 ( alpha6beta1 and alpha6beta4 ) has been shown in pancreatic carcinoma cells [ 11 ] , and breast cancer [ 25 ] .
unlike integrin alpha5 , which functions as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor , alpha6 integrin ( alpha6beta1 and alpha6beta4 ) has been implicated only in promoting tumor progression [ 26 - 29 ] .
recent evidence has demonstrated that integrin alpha6 is necessary for tumorigenicity of a stem - cell - like subpopulation within the mcf7 breast cancer cell line [ 30 ] .
integrin alpha6 can form heterodimers with either beta1 or beta4 .
both heterodimers ( alpha6beta1 and alpha6beta4 ) are receptors for laminin , a component of basement membrane [ 31 ] .
higher expression level of alpha6 ( alpha6beta1 and alpha6beta4 ) was also observed in malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors [ 32 ] and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells [ 17 ] .
these results suggest that alpha 6 integrin is important in tumorigenesis .
our results indicate that overexpression of alpha5 integrin and reduction of alpha6 integrin subunits prevents cells from passing g1 / s phase transition , so that cells in s phase accumulate .
since our work indicated growth arrest in the g1 phase of the cell cycle and based on pcr array data , we investigated whether cyclin e is affected by integrin modulation .
cyclin e / cdk2 complex is a major regulator of g1 / s phase transition .
the major function of cyclin e is to promote progression through the g1 / s phase of the cell cycle by associating with cdk2 to phosphorylate and inactivate retinoblastoma protein and release e2f transcription factors [ 33 ] .
the activities of the cdks are regulated by several mechanisms , including binding of cyclins , phosphorylation , and dephosphorylation , as well as binding to cdk inhibitors ( ckis ) .
overexpression of alpha5 integrin and downregulation of alpha6 regulate the expression of cyclin e and cdk2 , but not that of cyclin d .
p27kip1 , a member of the cip / kip family of ckis , alters the activities of cyclin d1 in quiescent cells , leading to failure of the g1 / s transition and cell - cycle arrest .
our results indicate that the modulation of the integrins enhances p27 expression .
consistent with this , phosphorylation of prb is decreased , suggesting that the integrin modulation regulates metastasis affecting rb phosphorylation .
furthermore , the changes in integrin expression cause upregulation of chk1 and downregulation of cdc25a expression .
chk1 inhibits cdc25a expression , whereas cdc25a phosphatase dephosphorylates and activates cdk2 / cyclin e complex during the g1 - s transition in proliferating cells [ 34 ] .
cdc25a is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of chk 1 , which is involved in an s - phase check point pathway that responds to genotoxic stress evoked by dna damaging agents or irradiation [ 33 ] .
it is currently unknown how chk1 is induced upon overexpression of alpha5 or reduction of alpha6 integrin .
in addition , although the mechanism responsible for these changes is not known , our results indicate that e2f1 expression is upregulated as a result of integrin expression changes .
chk1 has been shown to phosphorylate cdc25a , downregulating its phosphatase activity through distinct mechanisms [ 34 ] .
for instance , worms and colleagues reported that chk1 kinase negatively regulates mitotic function of cdc25a phosphatase through 14 - 3 - 3 binding [ 35 ] .
based on our results , we propose the following model .
integrin alpha5 subunit overexpression or reduction of alpha6 subunit integrin upregulates chk1 , which leads to downregulation of cdc25a ; this in turn reduces the activity of cyclin e / cdk2 .
the reduction of activation causes decreased prb phosphorylation and , as a consequence , cell - cycle growth is inhibited .
simultaneously , p27 is upregulated , which also can downregulate the expression cdk2 .
furthermore , e2f is upregulated , which may cause enhanced expression of chk1 , a regulator of e2f1 .
this may upregulate chk1 to downregulate cdc25a in a feedback loop mechanism .

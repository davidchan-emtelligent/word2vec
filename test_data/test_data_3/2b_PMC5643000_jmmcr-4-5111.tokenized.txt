vibrio furnissii is a motile , gram - negative , oxidase - positive , halophilic bacteria first defined in 1977 .
it is ubiquitously present in marine environments and is one of the 11 non - cholera vibrio species pathogenic in humans , which can lead to human gastroenteritis and extra - intestinal manifestations .
case presentation .
a 73 - year - old female patient was admitted to the hospital with acute gastroenteritis after consumption of seafood , which later by microbiological investigations was confirmed as vibrio furnissii , a member of the family vibrionaceae .
the patient was treated with oral doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. conclusion. v. furnissii , an emerging pathogen known for quite some time as an aetiological agent responsible , for acute gastroenteritis cases yet to get more clinical attention .
descriptions of putative virulence factors of this pathogen are limited , and in - depth studies on the pathogenesis of v. furnissii need to be established .

introduction vibrio furnissii is a motile , gram - negative , oxidase - positive , halophilic bacteria first defined in 1977 and subsequently isolated from diarrhoeal and environmental sources [ 1 ] .
vibrio furnissii and vibrio fluvialis are exceedingly alike in their phenotypic characteristics , however v. furnissii is differentiated from v. fluvialis by its production of gas from the fermentation of carbohydrates and also by the sequence differences in the genes toxr and rpob [ 1 ] .
it is one of the 11 non - cholera vibrio species pathogenic in humans [ 2 ] .
these ' emerging vibrio species' include v. furnissii , a widespread , free - living , marine species that is associated with acute gastroenteritis [ 3 ] .
vibrio furnissii from human gastroenteritis is rarely reported and clinical characteristics of infections with this organism have not been well reported [ 4 ] .
the disease typically occurs after ingesting contaminated raw or undercooked seafood or after contact with warm marine environments [ 2 ] .
here we describe a patient who developed gastroenteritis from v. furnissii and was successfully treated with oral antibiotics doxycycline and ciprofloxacin .
case report a 73 - year - old female patient was admitted to our hospital on 17 july 2016 .
she had been suffering from acute gastroenteritis for about 10 days with 2 - 3 episodes of loose stools per day .
there was no history of vomiting , abdominal pain or fever in the patient .
she had consumed fried sea - fish before the onset of diarrhoea .
the patient had type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 9 years .
she also had a past history of hypothyroidism and osteoporosis .
she had been previously treated for colonic cancer 16 years earlier and was on intermittent treatment for irritable bowel syndrome for 5 years .
she had also undergone right hip replacement surgery about 2 years ago .
investigations stools passed were watery , not bloodstained , without melena and non - purulent .
on examination , the patient 's vital signs were normal with respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute , blood pressure ( bp ) 130 / 70 mmhg , pulse rate 88 beats per minute .
no fever and no signs of dehydration were seen .
no abnormalities were detected in the cardiovascular , central nervous and respiratory system .
her abdomen was soft and non - tender .
no organomegaly was found .
her potassium levels were low , and white blood cell count ( 8.5x103 microl - 1 ) was found to be normal .
initially the patient was started on empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone , 2 g once daily .
subsequently , after the stool culture suggested vibrio furnissii , oral doxycycline , 100 mg twice daily , was added .
the patient continued to have 4 - 6 episodes of diarrhoea per day .
later , ceftriaxone was replaced by oral ciprofloxacin , 500 mg twice daily .
repeated stool culture sent after treatment was found to be negative for vibrio furnissii .
the patient improved symptomatically too and was discharged home .
diagnosis the stool specimens from the above case were received at the microbiology laboratory attached to a tertiary care hospital ( kasturba medical college hospital , manipal , india ) .
macroscopic observation of the stool samples revealed a watery stool with no blood and mucus in it. occult blood was negative , microscopic examination showed moderate wbc and macrophages but no rbc / ova / cyst / trophozoites .
the specimens were then inoculated into blood agar , macconkey agar , selenite faeces broth , alkaline peptone water and hekton enteric agar as a standard laboratory protocol [ 5 ] .
after overnight incubation at 37 degreesc , predominant beta - haemolytic colonies from blood agar obtained from alkaline peptone watersubculture were subjected to a battery of biochemical tests .
the isolate was oxidase - positive , gave acid / acid with gas on triple sugar iron agar with no h2s , reduced nitrate to nitrite , utilized citrate as a sole source of carbon , did not produce indole , was methyl red - positive , voges - proskauer - negative and urease - negative , fermented d - glucose with gas , showed arginine dihydrolyase activity , but lysine and ornithine were not decarboxylated .
the colonies were also confirmed as vibrio furnissii by using matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof ms ) .
the repeat samples sent also yielded vibrio furnissii .
antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates was done by the standard kirby - bauer disc diffusion method following clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) guidelines .
the isolate was found to be resistant ( microg per disc ) to ampicillin ( 10 ) , and sensitive ( microg per disc ) to ceftriaxone ( 30 ) , ciprofloxacin ( 5 ) , chloramphenicol ( 30 ) , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole ( 1.25 / 23.75 ) , tetracycline ( 30 ) and gentamicin ( 30 ) ( table 1 ) .

treatment according to the antimicrobial susceptibility report , the patient was treated with doxycycline , 100 mg orally given twice daily , with ciprofloxacin added later .
outcome and follow - up after treatment the patient was symptomatically better , and no intestinal pathogens were reported from her repeat stool microbiological investigations .
discussion vibrio furnissii is ubiquitously present in aquatic marine environments [ 2 ] and in the intestines of healthy brown shrimp [ 6 ] .
infections caused by these vibrios are often associated with ingestion of contaminated seafood / exposure to coastal waters [ 2 ]. v. furnissii has also been associated with outbreak and sporadic cases of human gastroenteritis [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 8 ] .
a case of v. furnissii bacteraemia with associated bilateral lower extremity lesions was also reported [ 9 ] .
in this study , we found v furnissii causing gastroenteritis , which is the first case report from india , with only a few cases being reported from other countries .
initially , v. furnissii was taxonomically assigned with v. fluvialis and named as aerogenic biogroup of v. fluvialis .
based on dna relatedness and several biochemical tests , v. furnissii has been separated as a new species [ 9 ] .
in the phylogenetic analysis with several housekeeping genes , v. furnissii and v. fluvialis have been linked as close species .
the nucleotide comparison of 16s rrna gene , reca and toxr sequences showed that v. furnissii and v. fluvialis had 100 % similarity. with the gyrb sequence , there was 93 % similarity shared by vibriao cholerae , vibrio mimicus , v. furnissii and v. fluvialis [ 10 ] .
the relative pathogenicity of v. furnissii in most of these instances of human gastroenteritis was unclear , in that other pathogens may have contributed to the disease or that the individuals were asymptomatic at the time of stool collection .
some factors suggested as contributing to virulence in v. furnissii have been reported .
flagellum is a virulence factor in vibrio as well as several bacteria [ 11 ] .
the property of v. furnissii culture supernatants to lyse erythrocytes and their lethal effects on epithelial cells is a remarkable feature of pathogenesis [ 4 ] .
in addition to the pathogenic factors of vibrio such as proteases , haemagglutinins and other hydrolytic exoenzymes , haemolysin is one among them responsible for its pathogenesis [ 12 ] .
the lipopolysaccharide component also plays an important role in the virulence by preventing the formation of the complement membrane attack complex thus precluding cell lysis [ 13 ] .
in our case , the v. furnissii isolated was found to be resistant to ampicillin and sensitive to all other antibiotics like cotrimoxazole , gentamicin , chloramphenicol , tetracycline and ciprofloxacin .
other reports also reveal the same pattern of resistance to the antibiotics [ 7 , 9 ] .
no other family members of the patient who had consumed the same food were affected .
the immunocompromised conditions of the patient such as age , diabetes mellitus and other illnesses could have resulted in her having acute gastroenteritis .
a literature survey from the pubmed database shows no reports of v. furnissii being isolated from humans in india .
though the emerging pathogen v. furnissii has been known for quite some time , its clinical importance is not well documented in the literature .
there are not many established in - depth studies done on the pathogenesis of this emerging pathogen to - date .
funding information the authors received no specific grant from any funding agency .
conflicts of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest .
ethical statement written consent was obtained from the patient for publishing these data .

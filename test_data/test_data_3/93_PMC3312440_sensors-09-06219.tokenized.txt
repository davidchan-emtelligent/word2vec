in this study we used the commercial 0.35 mum cmos ( complementary metal oxide semiconductor ) process and simple maskless post - processing to fabricate an array of micromirrors exhibiting high natural frequency .
the micromirrors were manufactured from aluminum ; the sacrificial layer was silicon dioxide .
because we fabricated the micromirror arrays using the standard cmos process , they have the potential to be integrated with circuitry on a chip .
for post - processing we used an etchant to remove the sacrificial layer and thereby suspend the micromirrors .
the micromirror array contained a circular membrane and four fixed beams set symmetrically around and below the circular mirror ; these four fan - shaped electrodes controlled the tilting of the micromirror .
a mems ( microelectromechanical system ) motion analysis system and a confocal 3d - surface topography were used to characterize the properties and configuration of the micromirror array .
each micromirror could be rotated in four independent directions .
experimentally , we found that the micromirror had a tilting angle of about 2.55degrees when applying a driving voltage of 40 v. the natural frequency of the micromirrors was 59.1 khz .
micromirror array microactuator cmos - mems 1 .
introduction the popularity of portable computers , mobile communication devices , and personal electronics is growing rapidly , with many consumers desiring bright , high - resolution , large - viewing - area , and compact displays .
the main challenges when fabricating portable displays and microvision systems are the size , power consumption , and the choice of manufacturing process .
microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) technology , mostly developed during the past two decades , can be used to overcome these challenges .
micromirrors are among the important optical devices used in scanned display and image systems .
they are also applied widely in projection display systems [ 1 ] , optical scanners [ 2 ] , optical waveguides [ 3 ] , and optical switches [ 4,5 ] , and for signal processing in rear - projection televisions [ 6 ] .
micromirrors allow scanners in point - to - point scanning to produce distortion - corrected images on highly curved surfaces .
for example , chiou and lin [ 7 ] developed a torsion micromirror device possessing multiple driving electrodes to investigate the effect on the tilting angle of the arrangement of driving electrodes .
jang and kim [ 8 ] presented a digitally operated micromirror array possessing a torsional spring ; they studied the deviations in pull - in voltages obtained using different spring sizes , finding they were clearly affected by the mirror gap and the spring width .
several studies have revealed the feasibility of manufacturing micromirrors using surface or bulk micromachining processes .
for instance , al - aribe and knopf [ 9 ] proposed a mems torsion micromirror for use in optical switches .
in general , however , mems - based micromirrors may possess some problematic features , such as high process complexity , high driving voltages , high power consumption , and difficulty in combining them with circuits on chips .
standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) processes allow the fabrication of small devices ; the cmos - mems technique is the name of the commercial cmos process used to fabricate mems devices [ 10 - 13 ] .
micromirrors manufactured using the cmos - mems technique have many advantageous properties , including stable processing , ready integration with circuits , and low cost .
many actuation methods can be used on mems actuators , including thermoelectric , pressured , magnetic , and electrostatic force methods .
among these approaches , the electrostatic force method is the most popular for achieving rapid response times , low power consumption , and simple electronics .
many researchers have developed electrostatic actuating micromirrors , such as texas instruments' digital micromirror device ( dmd ) [ 14 ] , at & t 's optical switches [ 15 ] , and cheng and co - worker 's mirror integrated with circuitry [ 16 ] .
herein , we discuss a rotatable micromirror array that is driven using electrostatic forces .
in this paper , we present a surface - micromachined and rotatable micromirror array fabricated using the commercial 0.35 mum cmos process .
the post - cmos process in this work that requires only one maskless wet etching process is simpler than that of cheng et al .
[ 16 ] .
thereby , the post - process is easy to execute and low cost .
many electrostatically actuated micromirrors not only rotate but also displace downward when they are actuated .
we introduce a center pin to prevent such downward displacement .
the natural frequency of this micromirror array is suitable for commercial project displays in which the dot pitch is sufficiently small to provide high resolution .
2. design and simulation figure 1 displays a schematic representation of a micromirror in our array .
material of the mirror is aluminum .
its structure is circular , suspended and supported by four fixed beams and one pin .
the pin , located at the center of the micromirror , is a holder providing the tilt stability of the micromirror ; its diameter is 0.5 mum .
the diameter of the mirror is 100 mum ; each supported beam is 60 mum long , 2 mum wide and 0.5 mum thick .
four quarter - circle fixed electrodes , which are the driving units used to tilt the mirror , are located below the suspended mirror ; each fixed electrode controlled one tilting direction .
the mirror is actuated by electrostatic force , the strength of which is given by : ( 1 ) f = epsilonav22d2where epsilon is the permittivity , a is the overlapping area , d is the distance of the parallel electrodes , and v is the driving voltage applied to the fixed electrode and the mirror .
when a dc bias is applied to the mirror and the fixed electrode , the mirror tilted toward the fixed electrode , allowing the mirror to be rotated in the x and y directions .
because the gap between the mirror and the driving electrode is 2.6 mum , the permittivity in air is 8.85 x 10 - 12 f / m , and the overlapping area is 1,590 mum2 , equation ( 1 ) suggests that the electrostatic force of 1.2759 mun would result under an applied driving voltage of 40 v. figure 2 ( a ) presents a model of the dynamic motion of a micromirror suspended and fixed by four cantilever beams .
the micromirror is positioned flat and horizontal to the surface in the absence of a driving voltage .
as shown in figure 2 ( b ) , the micromirror is tilted upon applying a driving voltage .
among the four cantilever beams , two are transformed into springs ( k ) and the other two are equal to torsion springs ( kt ) .
if applying an ac voltage of vsinomegat to the micromirror , the micromirror produces a harmonic motion .
the lower electrodes are quarter - circle shape , so their center of gravity are at the position of 423pir. from newton 's law , the equation of motion of the micromirror is given by : ( 2 ) imtheta + ctheta. +( 2kr2 + 2kt + kp ) theta = 423pi rf sin omegatand : ( 3 ) im = 14 mr2 ( 4 ) k = 12eil3 ( 5 ) kt = gjl ( 6 ) kp = 4eiplpwhere theta represents the rotated angle of the mirror when the driving voltage is applied ; theta is the angular velocity ; theta is the angular acceleration ; and f is defined by equation ( 1 ) ; im is the mass moment of inertia of the mirror ; c is the air damping ; r is the radius of the mirror , m is the mass of the mirror ; e is the young 's modulus of the cantilever beams and the pin , i is the moment of inertia of the cantilever beams ; g is the shear modulus of the torsion bars ; j is the polar moment of inertia of the torsion bars ; l is the length of the cantilever beams and the torsion bars ; kp is the stiffness of the pin ; ip is the moment of inertia of the pin ; and lp is the length of the pin .
equation ( 2 ) can be written as : ( 7 ) theta + 2sigmaomegantheta. + omegantheta = m0 sin omegatand : ( 8 ) ke = 2kr2 + 2kt + kp ( 9 ) sigma = c2im omegan ( 10 ) omegan = keim ( 11 ) m0 = 42rf3piimwhere ke represents the equivalent stiffness of the mirror ; zeta is the damping ratio ; omegan is the natural frequency of the mirror , and m0 is the moment .
the particular solution of equation ( 7 ) can be expressed as [ 17 ] : ( 12 ) theta ( t )= theta sin ( omegat - phi ) and : ( 13 ) theta = m0ke ( 1 - romega2 ) 2 +( 2sigmaromega ) 2where theta and phi are the amplitude and phase angle of the response , respectively ; romega is the frequency ratio and romega = omega / omegan .
the maximum amplitude occurs when romega = 1 - 2sigma2 [ 17 ] substituting romega = 1 - 2sigma2 and equations ( 1 ) and ( 11 ) into equation ( 13 ) , the maximum amplitude of the rotated angle in the micromirror can be obtained : ( 14 ) thetamax = 2epsilonrav23pid2 kesigma1 - sigma2 in the design , the equivalent stiffness of the mirror , ke , is about 1.35 x 10 - 9 n - m / rad , and the overlapping area of the electrodes , a , is 1,590 mum2 .
figure 3 shows the maximum amplitude of the micromirror with different damping ratios , which is evaluated by equation ( 14 ) .
in addition to the equivalent stiffness and the geometric shape of the mirror , the maximum rotated angle of the mirror depends on the driving voltage and the damping ratio .
the resonant frequency of the micromirror is given by : ( 15 ) f = omegan2pi = 12pikeim in accordance with equation ( 15 ) , we know that the resonant frequency of the mirror changes as the effective stiffness and the mass moment of inertia of the mirror vary .
the equivalent stiffness in equation ( 8 ) contains three factors of k , kt and kp. so it is not easy to determine the values of k , kt and kp according to the equivalent stiffness .
in order to easier determine the values of k , kt and kp , the dimensionless resonant frequency is introduced .
substituting equations ( 3 ) and ( 8 ) into equation ( 15 ) , the dimensionless resonant frequency of the micromirror can be obtained : ( 16 ) f12pikm = 22 + alpha + 2betaand : ( 17 ) alpha = kpkr2 ( 18 ) beta = ktkr2where alpha and beta are the stiffness ratio .
figure 4 shows the dimensionless resonant frequency of the micromirror , which is computed by equation ( 16 ) .
the results depict that the dimensionless resonant frequency of the micromirror are 4.47 and 10 corresponding to the stiffness ratios of 0 and 10 , respectively , at alpha = 3 .
in our design , the value of e is 70 gpa ; i is 2.08 x 10 - 26 m4 ; g is 28 gpa ; l is 60 mum ; ip is 3.07 x 10 - 27 m4 ; lp is 1.4 mum and j is 3.54 x 10 - 25 m4 .
we substitute these values into equations ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , the stiffness of the cantilever beams , the torsion bars and the pin can be evaluated , and the results are k = 0.081 n / m , kt = 1.646 x 10 - 10 n - m / rad and kp = 6.136 x 10 - 10 n - m / rad .
according to equations ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) with r = 50 mum , we yield that the stiffness ratio of alpha and beta are 3 and 0.81 , respectively .
as shown in figure 4 , the dimensionless resonant frequency is 5.14 at alpha = 3 and beta = 0.81 .
the mass of the mirror is 1.158 x 10 - 11 kg , so we calculate the resonant frequency of the micromirror to be 68.7 khz .
all symbols are listed in table 1 , and the material and geometric properties in the micromirrors are summarized in table 2 .
3. fabrication of the micromirror array the micromirror array was manufactured using the commercial cmos process of the taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ( tsmc ) , according to the micromirror layout defined in figure 1 .
figure 5 ( a ) displays the cross - section of the micromirror after completion of the cmos process .
because the mirror was fabricated from aluminum , which was highly optically reflective (> 90 %) [ 16 ] , it could reduce the degree of optical signal loss resulting from transmission .
after performing the standard cmos process , we obtained the final structure of the micromirror by applying a post - processing procedure to remove the sacrificial layer , and to suspend the mirror .
the material of sacrificial layer was silicon dioxide .
figure 5 ( b ) presents the mirror after completion of the post - process .
first , we cleaned the sample with acetone to remove any impurities .
next , we used an oxide etchant of silox [ 18 ] to remove the sacrificial layer in which the mirror was embedded .
in order to avoid the sticking problem , the mirror was immersed in isopropyl alcohol for 20 min and baked in oven at 100 degreesc for 30 min after the wet etching process .
figures 6 ( a ) and ( b ) shows sem ( scanning electron microscopy ) images of the micromirror array and a single mirror , respectively , after completion of the post - process .
figure 6 ( c ) reveals that the sacrificial layer was removed and the micromirror was successfully suspended .
figure 7 displays the fixed electrodes positioned below the suspended mirror and the supportive pin located at the center of the mirror , revealing that they were not damaged during the wet etching process .
the etching time control is very important for the undercut problem .
a test - key was used to monitor the etch - stop time and to avoid over etching and undercut problems 4 .
results and discussion the profile of the mirror is an important characteristic affecting its performance .
we employed a confocal surface optical scan system - - a 3d high - resolution , non - contact surface measurement system ( nanofocus ) featuring a microscope and a pzt ( lead zirconate titanate ) actuator - - to detect the configuration of the mirror .
this system had the ability to calculate the out - of - plane displacement and tilting angle and establish the 3d configuration automatically .
the dot pitch is another important parameter affecting the quality of display systems [ 19 ] .
for a high - resolution display system , the dot pitch is limited to 250 mum .
figure 8 ( a ) presents the profile of the mirror in the absence of a driving voltage .
the deformation of this mirror was less than 100 nm , i.e. , the mirror was flat and not rotated in the initial state .
when the driving voltage was less than 15 v , the displacement of the mirror was small ; the largest displacement occurred when the driving voltage was 40 v. figure 8 ( b ) displays the profile of the mirror under a driving voltage of 40 v. the measured result showed that the displacement of the mirror edge was about 2.10 mum at a driving voltage of 40 v , and the tilting angle of the mirror was about 2.55degrees .
figure 9 reveals the measured tilting angle of the micromirror under various driving voltages .
the results depicted that the tilting angle of the mirror was about 0.24degrees and 0.95degrees at the driving voltage of 15 v and 30 v , respectively .
furthermore , we employed finite element method ( fem ) software ( coventor ware ) to simulate the tilting angle of the micromirror , and the simulated tilting angle of the micromirror under different driving voltages was shown in figure 9 .
the simulated results presented that the tilting angle of the mirror was about 0.21degrees and 0.74degrees at the driving voltage of 15 v and 30 v , respectively .
as shown in figure 9 , the simulated and measured tilting angles for the micromirror were similar under various driving voltages ; the slight differences between individual mirrors resulted from variations in the etching during post - processing .
the stiffness of the beams decreased because of the post - process etching , leading to that the measured values being larger than the simulated ones .
we employed a mems motion analysis system to detect the frequency response of the micromirrors .
this measurement system includes a function generator that can apply high - amplitude ac voltages and a microscope to observe the motion of the micromirror .
the analyzer takes many images every second to determine the displacement and frequency response of the vibratile object .
figure 10 reveals the frequency response of the micromirror measured by the mems motion analysis system .
the measured results showed that the resonant frequency of the micromirror was 59.1 khz .
the vertical axis scan rate is a measure of how many times a display can refresh its whole frame .
for video applications , the resolution standards [ e.g. , svga ( 800 x 600 )] require a frame refresh rate of 60 hz. in this situation , the line rate ( horizontal scan ) of an svga display is 36,000 lines per second .
using a bidirectional - scanning technique , a horizontal scanner operating at 18 khz requires a scanner retracing rate of 19 - 20 khz [ 19 ] .
in future , it is likely that consumers will demand higher resolution and more - fluent video play ; therefore , the development of micromirror arrays exhibiting high resonant frequency and small dot pitches will be critical to enable commercially viable displays .
5. conclusions we have fabricated a micromirror array using the commercial 0.35 mum cmos process and the post - process .
because this fabrication technique was compatible with the cmos process , such micromirror arrays have potential to be integrated with circuitry on a chip .
the low - cost post - processing method involved simple wet etching with a silox etchant to etch the sacrificial layer .
in the absence of a driving voltage , the micromirror array was very flat ( deformation : < 100 nm ) .
the mirror was rotatable in four independent directions .
the experimental results showed that the tilting angle of the micromirror was about 2.55degrees under an applied driving voltage of 40 v , and the resonant frequency of the micromirror was 59.1 khz .

aim the present investigates deals with the change in the pharmacokinetic of sildenafil citrate ( sil ) in disease condition like diabetic nephropathy ( dn ) .
method diabetes was induced in rats by administering streptozotocin i.e. stz ( 60 mg / kg , ip ) saline solution .
assessment of diabetes was done by god - pod method and conformation of dn was done by assessing the level of creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and albuminurea .
after the conformation of dn single dose of drug sil ( 2.5 mg / kg , p.o. ) were given orally and pharmacokinetic parameters like [ auc o - t ( ug.h / ml ) , auc 0 - infinity , cmax , tmax , kel , clast ] were estimated in the plasma by the help of hplc - uv. result there was significant increase ( p < 0.01 ) in the pharmacokinetic parameters of sil in dn rat ( auc0 - t , auc0 - infinity , cmax , tmax and t1 / 2 ) compare to normal control rat and significant increase kel in the dn rat compare to control rat .
conclusion the study concluded that there was significant ( p < 0.01 ) increase in the bioavailability of sil in dn. diabetic nephropathy streptozotocin sildenafil citrate introduction diabetes mellitus is a complex endocrine metabolic disorder .
globally , as of 2010 , an estimated 285 million people had diabetes , with type 2 making up about 90 % of the cases [ 1 ] .
its incidence is increasing rapidly , and by 2030 , this number is estimated to almost double [ 2 ] .
india has more diabetics than any other country in the world , according to the international diabetes foundation [ 3 ] .
clinically , the main consequence of hyperglycemia is secondary impairments in various tissues and organs .
some complications such as cardio vascular disease , kidney disease , retinopathy , and nervous system diseases result in substantial morbidity and mortality [ 4 ] .
what is especially note worthy that the pharmacokinetic parameters of many drugs are altered in diabetes [ 5 - 8 ] .
the possible reasons for these pharmacokinetics changes are diverse and complex , including gastrointestinal lesions which cause changes in drug absorption [ 9 ] ; changes in transporters responsible for uptake , efflux and elimination [ 10 ] ; changes in liver drug enzymes which alters metabolic rate [ 11 ] ; nephropathy which leads to changes of drug transport , metabolism and elimination [ 12 ] .
however , the pharmacokinetic parameters of drugs are usually determined from healthy subjects .
in clinical studies it has been reported that drug accumulated in some diabetic patients [ 13 ] , and diabetes may influence pharmacodynamics and increase the adverse effect of hypoglycemic agents .
therefore , the study of drug pharmacokinetics in the diabetic state is important and beneficial for clinical development .
diabetic nephropathy ( dn ) is a progressive , irreversible disease characterized by increasing blood pressure , microalbuminuria , proteinuria , and a continuous decline in glomerular filtration rate [ 14 ] .
there was number of drugs used in the management of dn. sildenafil citrate ( sil ) , 1 - [ 4 - ethoxy - 3 - ( 6 , 7 - dihydro - 1 - methyl - 7 - oxo - 3 - propyl - 1h - pyrazolo [ 4 , 3 - d ] pyrimidin - 5 - yl ) phenylsulfonyl ] - 4 methylpiperazine , primarily indicated in the treatment of erectile dysfunction [ 15 ] .
it acts by inhibiting cgmp - specific phosphodiesterase type 5 , an enzyme that promotes degradation of cgmp , which regulates blood flow in the penis .
literature suggest phosphodiesterase inhibitors type 5 ( sildenafil citrate ) having role in the management diabetic nephropathy so it is worthy to check the change in the pharmacokinetics of sil in diabetic complication like dn [ 16 ] .
material and methods animal healthy male sprague - dawley rats ( 200 - 300 gm ) were used for the pharmacological screening .
the animals were housed in polypropylene cages with wire mesh top and husk bedding and maintained under standard environmental conditions ( 25 +/ - 20c , relative humidity 60 +/ - 5 % , light - dark cycle of 12 hours each ) and fed with standard pellet diet ( trimurti feeds , nagpur ) and water ad libitum , were used for the entire animal study .
the rats were housed and treated according to the rules and regulations of cpcsea and iaec .
the protocols for all the animal studies were approved by the institutional animal ethical committee ( iaec ) .
cpcsea registration no .
- ( 650 / 02 / c / cpcsea / 08 ) .
instrumentation a double beam uv - visible spectrophotometer , model uv - 2401 pc ( japan ) with 10 mm matched quartz cell was used .

5 mum particle size ) and the analytical column was protected by a phenomenex c18 guard column ( 4 mm x 2.0 mm , i.d. ) .
materials and reagents sildenafil citrate was donated by ajanta pharmaceuticals pvt. ltd .
all the reagent and chemical used were of ar analytical & hplc grade .
methanol ( spectrochem ) and water ( lobachem ) used were of hplc grade .
induction of diabetes diabetic rats were induced with an ip injection of 60 mg / kg of stz ( dissolved in ph 4.5 citrate buffer immediately before injection ) , while controlled normal rats ( control group , n = 6 ) received 2.5 ml / kg of citrate buffer .
induction of the diabetic state was confirmed by measuring the blood glucose level at the 72 h after the injection of stz .
rats with more than 200 mg / dl blood glucose level was conformation of diabetes .
blood glucose level and biomarkers of nephropathy were checked after 21 day for the conformation of nephropathy .
after the conformation of diabetic nephropathy single dose of drugs were given orally to the following groups and the blood glucose level were checked .
group i : control group + sil ( 2.5 mg / kg ) , group ii : negative control ( stz ) + sil ( 2.5 mg / kg ) .
pharmacokinetic study single dose of sil citrate was given orally to different groups of rat for pharmacokinetic studies .
the rats were fasted overnight with free access to water before administration of drugs .
after a single oral administration of sil ( 2.5 mg / kg , p.o. ) , 0.5 ml of blood samples were collected from retro orbital plexus sinus at 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 and 24 h time - points .
plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at - 20degreesc until analysis .
aliquots of 0.1 ml serum samples were processed on the developed hplc method which was developed in our lab [ 17 ] .
the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with a non - compartmental model using kinetica tm soft - ware ( version 4.4.1 thermo electron corporation , u.s.a ) .
each value is expressed as mean +/ - sd. statistical analysis data were analyzed using graph pad prism version 5.0 for windows ( graph pad software , san diego , ca , usa ) .
data were statistically analyzed using student t test .
result table 1 shows that there was significant increase ( p < 0.01 ) in the blood glucose level ( 289.66 +/ - 3.40 ) , bun ( 20.39 +/ - 1.52 ) and creatinine ( 1.255 +/ - 0.07 ) level in blood in stz treated rat as compare to control group .
whereas stz treated group shows significant increase ( p < 0.01 ) albumin urea ( 266.7 +/ - 0.20 ) level in the urine compare to control group .
these results confirm the nephropathy induction .

discussion in the present study type 1 diabetes was induced by the stz in experimental rats [ 18 ] and the auc and c max of sil were compared with control rat .
diabetic nephropathy was marked by increase in the serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen in blood and albumin urea in urine [ 19 ] .
in the present study diabetic nephropathy was conformed as there were significant increases in these values .
sildenafil citrate is widely used as selective inhibitors of cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) - specific phosphodiesterase type 5 ( pde5 ) inhibitors in the treatment of erectile dysfunction ( ed ) [ 20,21 ] .
they can also be efficient as therapy for a range of cardiovascular diseases , such as pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) [ 22 - 24 ] .
the major route of elimination of sildenafil is hepatic metabolism , with renal excretion of unchanged drug [ 25 ] .
diabetic patients have higher level of circulating glucose in the blood , leading to non - enzymatic glycation of several proteins including albumin .
glycated albumin exhibits atherogenic effects in various cells [ 26 ] .
non - enzymatic glycation of albumin produces conformational changes in the structure of albumin ( affinity of the phenytoin binding site on albumin based on a modification of the lysine group ) [ 27 ] , which can increase the free fraction of acidic drugs in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes ( for more detail , see table two ) [ 28 - 35 ] .
worner et al .
[ 28 ] reported a 50 % decrease in binding of dansylsarcosine to albumin in diabetic patients , whereas the concentration of circulating albumin was the same in diabetic patients [ 36,37 ] .
glycation of blood and plasma proteins leads to reduction in protein binding capacity [ 38 - 40 ] .
a linear relationship has been reported between the degree of albumin glycation and the unbound fraction of drug in the serum of diabetic patients .
thus , for highly albumin bound acidic compounds the reduction in the plasma serum protein binding capacity has been shown in diabetic patients [ 41 ] .
in dn and control rat single dose of sil was given orally , and different pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed .
as dn leads to decrease in the gfr [ 42 ] and protein content in the blood as there is microalbuminurea in dn. this may increase the bioavailability of sil in dn rat .
there was ( table 2 ) increase in the pharmacokinetic parameters like auc0 - t , auc0 - infinity , cmax , tmax , kel and t1 / 2 in dn rat compare to normal control rat .
conclusion increase in the pharmacokinetic parameters of sil confirms its increased bioavailability in dn rats .

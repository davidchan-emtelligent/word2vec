this study aims to determine the difference in the inhibitory effect of temozolomide ( tmz ) on tj905 glioma cells and stem cells .
tj905 cancer stem cells were isolated .
livin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family .
the tj905 cells and cancer stem cells were transfected with a livin - shrna and negative - shrna , respectively , and then treated with tmz .
at 48 h post - transfection , a cell counting kit 8 assay , flow cytometry , and real - time qpcr were performed to detect cell proliferation , the cell cycle , and the expression of the caspase - 3 , - 7 , and - 9 mrnas , respectively .
as a result , the suppressive effect of tmz on tj905 cells was more significant than its effect on tj905 cancer stem cells .
tmz exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of tj905 glioma cells by arresting them at g0 / g1 phase and arresting cancer stem cells at s phase in a dose - dependent manner .
tmz inhibited livin mrna expression and increased the expression of the caspase - 3 , - 7 , and - 9 mrnas .
low livin mrna expression induced high levels of caspase - 3 , - 7 , and - 9 expressions , thus promoting the apoptosis of both tj905 cells and cancer stem cells in response to tmz treatment .
the tj905 cells transfected with the livin - shrna were more sensitive to tmz , whereas the tj905 glioma stem cells transfected with the livin - shrna showed no significant changes in their sensitivity to tmz .
in conclusion , the livin gene may play an important role in the resistance mechanisms of tj905 glioma cells and cancer stem cells .
however , livin had a more distinct role in tmz resistance , cell proliferation , and the cell cycle in tj905 glioma cells than in cancer stem cells .

j16ll05 introduction glioma is the most common intracranial malignant tumor .
although surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy have achieved great progress , glioma is still difficult to completely cure ( 1 ) .
the challenge lies in recurrence of the tumor and drug resistance to chemotherapy .
therefore , studies identifying new methods and ideas that overcome the limitations of current therapies and prolong the survival of patients suffering from gliomas are required ( 2 ) .
in recent years , studies of cancer stem cells have highlighted their roles in tumorigenesis and the development of cancer drug resistance ( 3 ) .
the theory postulates that cancer stem cells display natural chemoresistance , a relatively stationary state , the capacity to repair damaged dna , high expression of abc transporters , and a strong ability to resist apoptosis ; thus , these cells represent a new research target for chemotherapeutic drug resistance in glioma ( 4 ) .
cancer stem cells may be the key to solve the problems of chemotherapy resistance and tumor relapse ( 5 ) .
livin , which was identified as a new member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein ( iap ) family , is the only member of the eight member iap family that consists of two subunits .
the alpha and beta subunits are likely to facilitate the stronger anti - apoptotic activity of livin .
as shown in our previous studies , livin is associated with the resistance of glioma cells and cancer stem cells to chemotherapeutic drugs ( 6 , 7 ) .
temozolomide ( tmz ) , a type of alkylating reagent , is widely used to treat high - grade glioma ( 8 ) .
based on findings from recent clinical studies , tmz prolongs the average median survival time , thereby becoming the first - line chemotherapy drug for gliomas when combined with radiation ( 9 ) .
patients with glioblastoma containing a methylated mgmt promoter can benefit from tmz ( 10 ) .
however , the mechanism by which livin influences the proliferation of glioma cells and stem cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents remains unclear .
this study aims to explore the role of the anti - apoptotic gene livin in the effect of tmz on the proliferation and drug resistance of glioma stem cells , offering a new idea to solve drug resistance in glioma .

results separation and identification of glioma stem cells using serum - free culture and the magnetic activated cell sorting method , the tj905 glioma stem cells were successfully sorted from tj905 cells .
the proportion of cancer stem cells was approximately 0.64 - 0.91 % .
the tj905 cells cultured in serum - free media adhered to the wall of the vessel , showing a shuttle shape or triangular and irregular forms .
the cells were arranged closely and few pseudopodia were observed ( figure 1a ) .
cells were successfully separated into cd133 + and cd133 - populations using immunomagnetic beads .
the cd133 + cells were cultured in stem cell medium , and most were suspended in the medium .
after 3 - 4 days , most of the suspended cells had formed spheres and grew in suspension ( figure 1b ) .
after the stem cells were cultured for 7 days , immunofluorescence staining for nestin , gfap , and beta - tubulin was performed .
nestin exhibited strong positive immunoreactivity ( figure 1c ) , whereas gfap and beta - tubulin exhibited negative immunoreactivity .
furthermore , after medium containing 10 % fbs was used to culture the cd133 + cells , the spheres promptly adhered to the wall of the vessel and differentiated , presenting many pseudopodia and many irregular shapes , such as triangle , round , and star shapes ( figure 1d ) .
after 10 days of differentiation , immunofluorescence staining for nestin , gfap , and beta - tubulin was conducted .
immunofluorescence staining for nestin was negative , but immunofluorescence staining for gfap was strongly positive ( figure 1e ) , and beta - tubulin staining was positive ( figure 1f ) , indicating that glioma stem cells had differentiated .

establishment of the livin transfection model in tj905 cells and stem cells a livin gene transfection model was the key feature of this study and the foundation of this experiment .
therefore , we selected a lentiviral vector to establish the livin transfection model .
a lentiviral vector expressing the livin gene or the empty vector was successfully transfected into tj905 cells and stem cells to establish the cell models .
because the selected plasmid contains the green fluorescent protein gene , successfully transfected cells stably expressed green fluorescent protein and exhibited green fluorescence under the fluorescent microscope .
tj905 cells exhibited a normal morphology and adhered to the wall of the vessel under an ordinary optical microscope ( figures 2a,b ) and displayed the corresponding cell morphology under the fluorescence microscope ( figures 2c,d ) .
glioma stem cells exhibited suspended growth with a normal morphology under an ordinary optical microscope ( figures 2e,f ) and the corresponding cell morphology under a fluorescence microscope ( figures 2g,h ) .

detection of cell proliferation activity using the cck - 8 assay the proliferation rate of tj905 cells was higher than derived glioma stem cells .
tmz significantly inhibited the proliferation of tj905 cells and stem cells in a dose - dependent manner , displaying stronger inhibition toward tj905 cells .
the livin - shrna markedly inhibited the proliferation of tj905 cells and stem cells , which was also more distinct in tj905 cells ( figure 3 ) .

sensitivity of glioma cells and glioma stem cells to tmz before and after livin - shrna transfection tj905 cells transfected with the livin - shrna were more sensitive to tmz than cells transfected with the negative - shrna and controls , resulting in reduced drug resistance and indicating that the livin gene might play a crucial role in the resistance mechanism of tj905 glioma cells .
glioma stem cells transfected with the livin - shrna showed no significant changes in sensitivity to tmz compared with cells transfected with the negative - shrna and controls , indicating that the resistance mechanisms differed between tj905 glioma cells and stem cells .
in view of the lower levels of the livin mrna observed in glioma stem cells , the roles of the livin gene in the resistance of glioma cells and stem cells to chemotherapy differed .
real - time quantitative pcr analysis of the expression of related genes livin mrna expression was significantly higher in tj905 cells than in glioma stem cells .
tmz inhibited livin mrna expression in tj905 cells and stem cells and induces the expression of the caspase - 3 , - 7 , and - 9 mrnas .
livin mrna expression was reduced in tj905 glioma cells and stem cells following transfection with the livin - shrna , and the expression of the caspase - 3 , - 7 , and - 9 mrnas was also significantly increased ( figures 4 - 7 ) .
we repeated the experiments of caspase - 3 and - 7 expressions in u251 cells and stem cells and found the results were similar to those obtained with tj905 cells and stem cells ( figures 8 and 9 ) .

discussion although maximally effective therapies with surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation are performed in clinical practice , glioma , particularly glioblastoma , remains the most common and devastating primary brain tumor ( 20 ) .
recent studies have identified glioma stem cells in glioblastoma and showed that these cells likely play a key role in resistance to conventional therapies , as well as recurrence ( 21 ) .
glioma stem cells are capable of self - renewal and differentiation and de novo tumor formation for xenograft implantation .
furthermore , these cells possess unique signaling pathways to promote tumorigenesis and vascular formation ( 22 ) .
therefore , glioma stem cell growth and proliferation must be controlled to eradicate the recurrence of glioma after the administration of combined therapies .
in our study , tj905 tumor stem cells were isolated with the magnetic activated cell sorting method and the characteristics of the cancer stem cells were identified using immunofluorescence staining for nestin , beta - tubulin , and gfap .
immunofluorescence staining for nestin but not gfap and beta - tubulin was observed in the cancer stem cells , which contrasts with the results observed in cancer cells .
after cancer stem cells had been induced with normal culture medium , the results of the immunofluorescence staining were the same as tj905 cells , which also confirmed the successful isolation of glioma stem cells ( 23 , 24 ) .
chemotherapy resistance is the main focus of treatments for malignant glioma ( 25 ) .
the resistance of glioma remains difficult to resolve in clinical practice .
two types of cells were treated with tmz to examine whether glioma stem cells are equipped with stronger capability for drug resistance than glioma cells .
tmz effectively inhibited the proliferation of tj905 glioma cells and stem cells in a dose - dependent manner and had a greater effect on tj905 cells , which was consistent with other reports and revealed the presence of different resistant mechanism in the two cell types .
livin is a novel member of the iap family .
its overexpression in tj905 glioma cells and stem cells reduced cell apoptosis ; thus , livin exerts an anti - tumor effect .
the changes in livin expression induced by tmz suggest that livin may contribute to chemotherapy drug resistance .
recently , shrna transfection has emerged as a powerful technique , allowing transcriptional silencing of target genes in cells ( 26 ) .
the mechanism of shrna is not precisely transcriptional silencing .
the mrnas are synthesized but are unable to be effectively translated to proteins ( 26 ) .
therefore , we adopted the shrna transfection technique to explore the role of the livin gene in drug resistance and proliferation in tj905 glioma cells and stem cells .
after successfully transfecting the shrna , the livin - shrna was stably expressed in the cells and significantly inhibited livin mrna expression in tj905 glioma cells and stem cells .
temozolomide is included in the standard care for patients with glioblastoma multiforme after maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant partial brain radiation ( 27 ) .
the therapeutic benefit of tmz depends on its capability to alkylate / methylate dna , which damages the dna and triggers the death of tumor cells ( 28 ) .
however , the interaction between tmz and the livin gene is unclear .
in our study , tmz inhibited livin mrna expression in tj905 cells and stem cells and induced the expression of the caspase - 3 , - 7 , and - 9 mrnas , thereby inhibiting cell proliferation to exert its anti - tumor effect .
the livin gene may be upstream of caspase - 3 , - 7 , and - 9 .
low livin mrna expression induced the expression of the caspase - 3 , - 7 , and - 9 mrnas , thus promoting cell apoptosis .
in addition , we tested the mrna expression of caspase - 3 and - 7 in u251 glioma and derived glioma stem cells and found similar results , which strengthened the findings obtained from tj905 glioma cells and derived stem cells .
tmz may well exert its anti - tumor effect by inhibiting livin mrna expression .
tj905 cells transfected with the livin - shrna were more sensitive to tmz than cells transfected with the negative - shrna and controls , indicating that the livin gene may play a crucial role in the drug resistance mechanism of tj905 cells .
however , for glioma stem cells , the livin - shrna did not induce a significant change tmz sensitivity compared to the negative - shrna and controls , illustrating that the resistance mechanisms of tj905 glioma cells and stem cells differed .
because the livin mrna was expressed at lower levels in glioma stem cells , glioma stem cells were equipped with stronger resistance to tmz than tj905 cells .
the livin gene is not the only factor involved in drug resistance in glioma stem cells .
temozolomide and the livin - shrna effectively inhibited the proliferation of tj905 cells and stem cells , and the effects were more apparent on tj905 cells , suggesting that the livin gene partially promoted cell proliferation .
regarding the influence on the cell cycle , tmz and the livin - shrna consistently exerted an inhibitory effect on glioma cells by inducing cell cycle arrest in g0 / g1 phase .
in contrast , tmz exerted an inhibitory effect on glioma stem cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest in s phase .
however , the livin - shrna did not have a significant impact on the cell cycle of glioma stem cells , indicating that the livin gene played different roles in drug resistance and the cell cycle of tj905 cells and stem cells .
tmz likely inhibited the cell cycle of glioma stem cells through another mechanism .
in conclusion , glioma cells and derived stem cells showed strong resistance to tmz .
the livin gene played different roles in drug resistance and the cell cycle of tj905 glioma cells and stem cells .
the livin gene might play a vital role in the drug resistance of tj905 cells , but it is not the only factor involved in drug resistance in glioma stem cells .
in addition , some findings were confirmed in u251 cells and stem cells , which consolidated the conclusions of our study .
as well , mgmt promoter methylation status plays an impartment role in glioblastoma and was not reported in the tj905 cells ; further studies will focus on how livin interacts with mgmt promoter methylation and replicating the experiments in other primary patient - derived glioblastoma cell lines and so on. the mechanism of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents requires further study of new therapeutic targets for glioma in the future .

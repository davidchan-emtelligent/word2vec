however , the role of specific lipoprotein subfractions in very young cad patients (<= 45 years ) is not established yet .
a total of 734 consecutive cad subjects were enrolled and were classified as very early ( n = 81 , <= 45 ) , early ( n = 304 , male : 45 - 55 ; female : 45 - 65 ) , and late ( n = 349 , male : > 55 ; female : > 65 ) groups .
meanwhile , a group of non - cad subjects were also enrolled as controls ( n = 56 , <= 45 ) .
the lipoprotein separation was performed using lipoprint system .
as a result , the very early cad patients have lower large high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) subfraction and higher small low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) subfraction ( p < 0.05 ) .
although body mass index was inversely related to large hdl subfraction , overweight did not influence its association with very early cad .
in the logistic regression analysis , large hdl was inversely [ or 95 % ci : 0.872 ( 0.825 - 0.922 )] while small ldl was positively [ 1.038 ( 1.008 - 1.069 )] related to very early cad .
however , after adjusting potential confounders , the association was only significant for large hdl [ 0.899 ( 0.848 - 0.954 )] .
this study firstly demonstrated that large hdl subfraction was negatively related to very early cad suggestive of its important role in very early cad incidence .
the prevalence of coronary artery disease ( cad ) has increased sharply and manifested a younger trend , which has becoming an important public health issue1 .
although it has been estimated that less than 10 % of all individuals presenting with documented cad are in very young ages , it can have devastating consequences for these patients , their families , and society due to the high morbidity and long - term mortality2 .
till now , the extent of clinical risk factors for cad occurrence in the young population has been difficult to determine .
in terms of traditional risk factors , there is no unique one present in large groups of young adults with cad3 .
previous epidemiological studies indicated that the relatively more important risk factors in young patients are their elevated body mass index ( bmi ) , smoking habits , hypertension , and specifically , dyslipidemia4 .
currently , the treatment of dyslipidemia has been established as one of the principal targets in clinical practice due to its key role in the development of cad56 .
however , despite the major advances in the treatment of dyslipidemia , such as the low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol ( ldl - c ) lowering78 and high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol ( hdl - c ) raising910 strategies , residual cardiovascular risk remains high in a significant number of patients11 .
promisingly , recent studies demonstrated that the cholesterol content of ldl or hdl particles displays a large inter - individual variation1213 .
although the dysfunction of lipid metabolism is a major contributor for cad development and progression , lipoprotein subfractions have been suggested to be more precisely reflecting the atherogenity of lipids .
recently , our group demonstrated that patients with cad have relatively lower large hdl subfraction and higher small hdl and ldl subfraction , providing new perspectives with regard to the role of different lipoprotein subfractions in the cad prevalence14 .
in light of the specialization of patients with cad in young ages , we hypothesized that the distribution and impact of lipoprotein subfractions in younger cad patients may be varied with those in older ones .
however , such data has been unavailable till now .
therefore , the aim of the present study was to compare ldl and hdl subfractions separated by lipoprint system among controls without cad (<= 45 ) , very early cad (<= 45 ) , early ( male : 45 - 55 ; female : 45 - 65 ) , and late cad ( male : > 55 ; female : > 65 ) patients .
furthermore , we also aimed to assess the influence of different lipoprotein subfractions on very early cad (<= 45 years of age ) susceptibility .
methods study design and population the study complied with the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the hospital 's ethical review board ( fuwai hospital & national center for cardiovascular diseases , beijing , china ) .
each participant provided written , informed consent before enrollment. from october 2012 to june 2015 , we consecutively recruited 734 patients with angiography proven cad and a total of 56 non - cad controls (<= 45 years of age ) in our institution .
all the enrolled cad patients were classified into three groups : very early cad (<= 45 years of age , n = 81 ) , early cad ( male : 45 - 55 years of age ; female : 45 - 65 years of age , n = 304 ) , and late cad ( male : > 55 years of age ; female : > 65 years of age , n = 349 ) groups .
considering the potential influence of lipid lowering drugs on plasma levels of lipid profiles as well as lipoprotein subfractions , we only included patients who were not on the treatment of statins and / or other lipid - lowering drugs at least 3 months before entering the study .
exclusion criteria were subjects over 90 years , pregnancy or lactation , psychiatric disorder , the existence of any infectious or systematic inflammatory disease within 1 month , acute coronary syndrome , serious heart failure or arrhythmia , significant hematologic disorders , thyroid dysfunction , severe liver dysfunction ( aspartate aminotransperase or alanine aminotrabsferase three times more than the upper normal limits ) and / or renal insufficiency ( blood creatinine > 1.5 mg / dl ) and malignant tumors .
as depicted in our previous studies15 , the traditional risk factors were defined as follows .
hypertension was defined as repeated blood pressure measurements >= 140 / 90 mmhg ( at least two times in different environments ) or self - reported hypertension and currently taking anti - hypertensive drugs .
diabetes mellitus ( dm ) was defined as a fasting serum glucose level >= 126 mg / dl in multiple determinations , and / or the current use of medication for diabetes .
dyslipidemia was defined by medical history or fasting total cholesterol ( tc ) >= 200 mg / dl or triglyceride ( tg ) >= 150 mg / dl. bmi was calculated as weight ( kg ) divided by height ( m ) squared .
overweight was defined as bmi >= 25 kg / m2 .
biochemical and clinical analyses fasting blood samples were collected in pre - cooled edta tubes at baseline from each patient .
after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 degreesc , all plasma aliquots were stored in our laboratory at - 80 degreesc and were not thawed until use .
the plasma levels of ldl - c and hdl - c were analyzed directly by selective solubilization method ( low density lipid cholesterol test kit or determiner l hdl , kyowa medex , tokyo ) .
tc and tg were measured by enzymatic methods .
all of the lipid profiles were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer ( hitachi 7150 , tokyo , japan ) .
ldl and hdl subfraction analysis the cholesterol contents of ldl and hdl subfractions were determined electrophoretically by the lipoprint system ( lipoprint ldl system and lipoprint hdl system , respectively ; quantimetrix corporation , redondo beach , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions as described elsewhere1617 .
this method was based on electrophoresis of a liquid loading gel with lipophilic dye in the precast linear polyacrylamide gel ( stacking gel and separating gel ) .
for ldl particle , a typical lipoprint profile of decreasing size and increasing density with 1 very low density lipoprotein ( vldl ) band , 3 midbands , up to 7 ldl bands , and 1 hdl band were obtained .
the various stained bands ( lipoprotein subfractions ) presented in the sample were identified by their electrophoretic mobility ( rf ) using vldl as the starting reference point ( rf = 0 ) and hdl as the leading reference point ( rf = 1 ) .
seven ldl subfractions were obtained .
subfraction 1 represented large ldl particles , subfraction 2 indicated medium ldl particles , and subfractions 3 - 7 were defined as small dense ldl particles .
similarly , for hdl particle , the lipoprint hdl system using vldl / ldl as the starting reference point ( rf = 0 ) and albumin as the leading reference point ( rf = 1 ). between the two points , 10 hdl subfractions were obtained .
subfractions 1 - 3 represented large hdl particles , subfractions 4 - 7 indicated medium hdl particles , and subfractions 8 - 10 meant small hdl particles .
the cholesterol concentration ( mg / dl ) of each lipoprotein subfraction and the mean ldl particle size ( a ) were determined by this assay .
statistical analysis the data were expressed as the mean +/ - sd for the continuous variables and the number ( percentage ) for the categorical variables .
the student t test , one - way analysis of variance , or non - parametric test was used for the comparison between / among groups of continuous parameters as appropriate .
the categorical variables were compared using the chi - square test .
multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for determining the association of ldl or hdl subfractions with the incident of very early cad susceptibility .
a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
statistical studies were carried out with the spss program ( version 19.0 , spss , chicago , illinois , usa ) .
results summary of study subjects the baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the study population at baseline were shown in table 1 .
overall , the enrolled subjects were classified into four groups according to the presence of cad and the age of cad onset .
significantly , compared with the non - cad controls ( with a mean age of 41.1 +/ - 2.9 years old ) , the very early cad patients have higher bmi levels , higher percentage of hypertension and dyslipidemia .
meanwhile , in comparison with the relatively older cad patients , the very early cases were more likely to be more male gender , to have a higher bmi level , diastolic blood pressure , current smokers , and family history of cad .
however , the levels of inflammatory markers such as white blood cell count , fibrinogen , and high - sensitivity c reactive protein ( all p > 0.05 ) were similar among groups except for the lower concentrations of d - dimer ( p < 0.001 ) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( p = 0.004 ) .
the angiographic characteristics of cad participants according to age were presented in table 2 .
the left anterior descending artery was less frequently involved ( 86.1 % vs. 87.2 % vs. 92.9 % , p = 0.030 ) while the other related arteries were similar ( p > 0.05 ) in the very early patients compared with early and late cases .
in addition , compared to the early and late cad patients , the very early cases have higher percentage of single artery disease ( 39.0 % vs. 31.4 % vs. 24.6 % , p = 0.023 ) and less total number of diseased vessels ( 2.04 +/ - 0.98 vs. 2.15 +/ - 0.96 vs. 2.34 +/ - 0.95 , p = 0.009 ) .
hdl and ldl subfractions in very early cad patients to exclude the potential impact of age on the distribution of lipoprotein subfractions , we analyzed these parameters in very young patients with and without cad (<= 45 years of age ) .
we finally observed that the very early cad patients have relatively lower large hdl and higher medium and small ldl subfractions ( p < 0.05 , all ) ( fig. 1 ) .
moreover , by contrast to early and old cad patients , as shown in table 3 , the very early cad cases have higher mean concentrations of tg , tc , and ldl - c but lower levels of hdl - c ( all p < 0.01 ) .
regarding to the lipoprotein subfraction analysis , we found that the concentrations of large and medium hdl subfraction ( both cholesterol levels and percentages ) were significantly lower in the very early cad group ( cholesterol levels of large hdl : 10.16 +/ - 4.31 vs. 12.47 +/ - 6.23 vs. 14.34 +/ - 7.30 mg / dl , p < 0.001 ; large hdl percentage : 26.77 +/ - 7.52 vs. 29.10 +/ - 8.03 vs. 32.04 +/ - 7.99 % , p < 0.001 ; cholesterol levels of medium hdl : 19.01 +/ - 3.93 vs. 20.75 +/ - 6.57 vs. 21.01 +/ - 6.44 mg / dl , p = 0.035 ; medium hdl percentage : 51.42 +/ - 5.58 vs. 50.04 +/ - 5.17 vs. 48.95 +/ - 4.80 % , p < 0.001 ) .
on the contrary , the concentrations of small hdl subfraction ( percentage ) were significantly higher in the very early cad group ( 21.75 +/ - 7.47 vs. 20.63 +/ - 7.54 vs. 18.95 +/ - 6.22 % , p < 0.001 ) .
meanwhile , the very early cad group has markedly higher medium ldl subfraction ( cholesterol levels : 22.24 +/ - 9.23 vs. 20.77 +/ - 8.95 vs. 19.20 +/ - 8.98 mg / dl , p = 0.039 ) and small ldl subfraction ( cholesterol levels : 10.80 +/ - 12.41 vs. 10.27 +/ - 10.00 vs. 7.45 +/ - 8.33 mg / dl , p = 0.003 ; percentages : 4.99 +/ - 4.97 vs. 5.02 +/ - 4.51 vs. 3.79 +/ - 3.93 % , p = 0.008 ) as well as smaller mean ldl particle size ( 265.54 +/ - 6.13 vs. 265.42 +/ - 5.93 vs. 267.03 +/ - 5.54 a , p = 0.011 ) .
in the current analysis , the very early cad patients have significantly high bmi levels .
specifically , we found that bmi was negatively associated with cholesterol levels of large hdl ( r = - 0.297 , p < 0.001 , fig. 2a ) while positively related to cholesterol levels of small ldl ( r = 0.133 , p = 0.003 , fig. 2b ) .
next , we further investigated the differences in lipoprotein subfractions by comparing the lean ( bmi < 25 kg / m2 ) and the overweight cad patients ( bmi >= 25 kg / m2 ) .
as a result , the cholesterol levels of small ldl was highest in the very early cad group only in the lean but not in the overweight cases ( fig. 3a,b ) while the cholesterol levels of large hdl was lowest both in the lean and overweight cases ( fig. 3c,d ) .
relation of lipoprotein subfractions to very early cad incidence after observed the association of lipoprotein subfractions with very early cad cases , logistic regression analysis was performed in the current study .
in unadjusted analysis ( table 4 ) , among different hdl subfractions , large and medium hdl measures were inversely [ or 95 % ci : large hdl : 0.872 ( 0.825 - 0.922 ) ; medium hdl : 0.935 ( 0.889 - 0.983 )] associated with the incident of very early cad .
therefore , in the following multivariate logistic regression analysis , we further adjusted for bmi as well as other potential risk factors covering sex , hypertension , dyslipidemia , dm , current smoking , and family history of cad .
we finally found that only the cholesterol levels of large hdl [ or 95 % ci : 0.899 ( 0.848 - 0.954 )] remained negatively related to very early cad susceptibility ( table 4 ) .
discussion the current study is the first to document the relationship between lipoprotein subfractions and very early cad occurrence involving 734 consecutive cad patients and 56 non - cad controls who were not treated with lipid - lowering drugs .
specifically , we found that cad patients in younger ages have significantly lower large hdl subfractions , higher small hdl and ldl subfractions , and relatively smaller mean ldl particle size .
in the logistic regression analysis , large hdl subfraction was associated with lower risk while small ldl subfraction was related to higher risk of very early cad .
in addition , we found that overweight was not only related to large hdl and small ldl subfraction but also the age of cad incidence .
however , only large hdl subfraction remained negatively associated with cad in younger ages after adjusting for bmi and other potential confounders .
our data may provide novel information with regard to the potential role of different lipoprotein subfractions in the incident of very early cad .
although the cad occurrence in very young ages has a relatively low prevalence rate , it can have devastating consequences .
during the past decades , multiple studies have tried to address the issue why it happens in these very young individuals18 and finally emphasized bmi , smoking habits , hypertension , family history of cad , and dyslipidemia as more relevant risk factors4 .
however , it has been difficult to define risk factors unique to this population because all of these are traditional risk factors for common cad patients .
undoubtedly , the elevated lipid and lipoprotein levels remain one of the most pivotal risk factors for the development of cad in young ages .
previous study has revealed that the role of higher tc and ldl - c and lower hdl - c levels appeared to be important factors in the process of very early cad process1920 .
however , the concept of lipoprotein particle or subfraction has recently challenged the relevance of the cholesterol content of lipoproteins1321 .
the small dense ldl - c has been demonstrated to be associated with the incident cad in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study involving 11,419 participants22 .
a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the enhanced atherogenicity of small dense ldl , such as the higher penetration into the arterial wall , prolonged plasma half - life , and lower affinity for the ldl - receptor23 .
recently , martin et al. reported that low hdl3 - c ( small hdl - c ) subclasses , but not hdl2 - c ( large hdl - c ) was associated with increased long - term hard clinical events in two cohorts of secondary prevention24 .
in our recent study involving 591 un - treated patients , large hdl has been proven to be associated with lower rate of future cardiovascular events25 .
till now , the relationship between hdl subfraction and cardiovascular risk remains in debate and the potential mechanisms have not been elucidated yet .
in light of the preceding discussion , we tentatively investigate the distribution and potential impact of ldl and hdl subfractions with very early cad presence .
actually , ldl and hdl particles are comprised of a variety of different subfractions that can be separated by several methods .
among the various lipoprotein separation methods , lipoprint system , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy , and vertical auto profile method ( vap ) are most commonly applied in clinical research .
in this study , we applied the lipoprint system and 10 hdl and 7 ldl subclasses ( large hdl : 1 - 3 , medium hdl : 4 - 7 , and small hdl : 8 - 10 ; large ldl : 1 ; medium ldl : 2 ; small ldl : 3 - 7 ) have been separated .
this method was based on decreasing size and increasing density by electrophoresis of a liquid loading gel with lipophilic dye in the precast linear polyacrylamide gel ( stacking gel and separating gel ) 26 .
in addition , nmr was the currently common used method in clinical and laboratory research .
in this way , hdl and ldl subclasses were quantified using the amplitudes of their spectroscopically distinct lipid methyl group nmr signals27 .
the vap separates lipoproteins on the base of density using single vertical - spin density gradient ultracentrifugation24 .
the existing of diverse lipoprotein separation methodologies may mainly contribute to discrepancies .
as early in 1991 , salonen et al. reported that large hdl - c levels were inversely associated with the risk of acute myocardial infarction and may thus be protective factors28 .
besides that , our recent studies have revealed that large hdl subfraction was negatively associated with several cardiovascular risk factors , such as serum uric acid29 and hypertension30 .
in the current study , we found that only large hdl subfraction was negatively associated with very early cad susceptibility , which may provide additive information regarding the different role of specific subfraction on the very early cad incidence .
there were several limitations of the present study .
first , the cross - sectional design was a limitation .
therefore , the results should be evaluated with some degree of caution .
second , this was a single center study with relatively small sample size ( the very early cad group , n = 81 ) , the data should be confirmed by large scale studies .
finally , the lipoprotein subclassification was performed by lipoprint system , nmr and other methodologies may be necessary in the future studies .
in summary , the cad patients in younger ages have relatively lower large hdl subfractions , smaller mean ldl particle size , and higher small hdl and ldl subfractions .
only large hdl subfraction was inversely and independently associated with incident of very early cad after adjusting for potential confounders .
our data for the first time revealed the distribution of lipoprotein subfractions in very early cad status , suggesting the potential role of large hdl subfraction in the very early cad susceptibility .

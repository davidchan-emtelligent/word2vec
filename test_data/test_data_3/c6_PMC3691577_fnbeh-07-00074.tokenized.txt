doi : 10.3389 / fnbeh.2013.00052 evidence supporting the essential role of brain - derived ethanol metabolites in the excitation of dopamine ( da ) midbrain neurons has multiplied in the last 10 - 15 years .
the pioneer and influential behavioral studies by cm aragon and colleagues ( see correa et al. , 2012 for a complete review ) and more recent data ( sanchez - catalan et al. , 2009 ; marti - prats et al. , 2010 , 2013 ) have repeatedly demonstrated the crucial role displayed by acetaldehyde ( acd ) in the locomotor and other behavioral responses elicited by ethanol .
although these experiments mainly used an indirect measure ( exploratory locomotion ) as an index of the excitation of da neurons in the ventral tegmental area ( vta ) , results strongly suggested that the manipulations of ethanol brain metabolism determine the response ( activation or not ) of the da neurons in the mesolimbic system after ethanol administration .
at the beginning of the past decade , a remarkable leap in the study of the acd involvement in the ethanol - derived activation of vta da neurons was done .
several electrophysiological studies ( foddai et al. , 2004 ; melis et al. , 2007 ) directly demonstrated that vta da neurons are not excited after ethanol administration if acd production is inhibited .
the strength of the provided evidence was very high because , unlike behavioral studies , a direct measure of the neuronal activity after administration of the drug was registered .
these direct and indirect findings confirmed the involvement of acd in the excitation of the mesolimbic system .
but , in spite of their relevance , an important question relative to acd - derived excitation of the vta da neurons remains unresolved .
if acd is the responsible for the excitation of the da mesolimbic system after ethanol administration , how acd excites vta da neurons ?
in other words , what mechanism does acd use to activate da neurons ?
as occurs with ethanol , acd has not any subset of specific receptors on nerve , glial , or other cells in the brain .
moreover , acd , as other highly toxic aldehydes , is evanescent and reacts instantaneously with other compounds to form new products .
notably , biogenic amines are among the compounds that can react with acd producing the so - called tetrahydroisoquinolines .
the mesolimbic system is particularly enriched with da , so in this brain region acd locally formed after ethanol administration can react with da forming salsolinol ( sal ; 1 - methyl - 6,7 - dihidroxy - 1,2,3,4 - tetrahydroisoquinoline ) ( collins and bigdeli , 1975 ; nagatsu , 1997 ) .
in fact , in most cases , the results reported show that chronic ethanol treatment produces an increase of sal levels in different brain areas , such as the striatum , hypothalamus and limbic regions .
moreover , it is also evidenced that the type of treatment i.e. , the pattern of ethanol intake , determines the magnitude of enhancement of sal in brain ( see hipolito et al. , 2012 for review ) .
so the question now is : could sal be the responsible for the vta da neuronal excitation after ethanol administration ?
in this issue of frontiers of behavioral neuroscience , xie and ye review direct electrophysiological evidences supporting the role of sal in the vta da neuronal activation after ethanol administration .
as occurred with the evidence supporting the role of acd in ethanol effects , data initially provided by the scientific community on the involvement of sal on the ethanol - derived vta da excitation were indirect .
so , behavioral studies published in the last few years , showed that sal directly administered into the posterior vta is able to induce motor activation through a mechanism dependent on mu - opioid receptors ( mors ) ( hipolito et al. , 2010 ) .
moreover , sal is also able to induce motor sensitization and cpp ( hipolito et al. , 2011 ) , two behavioral responses closely related with activation of the da mesolimbic system .
importantly , sal is also self - administered into the posterior vta ( rodd et al. , 2008 ) .
a more direct proof supporting the ability of sal to activate vta da neurons was the demonstration that microinjections of sal into the posterior vta increase da levels in nac shell ( hipolito et al. , 2011 ; deehan et al. , 2013 ) .
nonetheless , the most direct demonstration derives from recent studies using electrophyisiological recordings .
to adequately appreciate the relevance of these new findings reviewed by xie and ye , it is important to remember that previous electrophysiological studies reported by this group in the past decade demonstrated that ethanol indirectly excites ( disinhibits ) vta da neurons ( xiao et al. , 2007 ) .
concretely , according to their data , ethanol inhibits , through a mechanism dependent on mors , the neuronal activity of local gaba neurons which tonically inhibit the activity of vta da neurons ( johnson and north , 1992 ) .
could sal be the responsible for these exciting findings ?
using whole - cell patch - clamp recordings to examine the effects of sal on vta da neurons in acute brain slices , ye and collaborators demonstrate that sal stimulates da neurons partly by reducing inhibitory gabaergic transmission through a mechanism dependent on mors .
xie and ye also review additional aspects on the mechanism of action of sal , such as the ability of sal to enhance presynaptic glutamatergic transmission onto vta da neurons via activation of da type 1 receptors in the glutamatergic terminal .
these and other novel aspects of the mechanism of action of sal could be crucial to finally understand how ethanol interacts with da mesolimbic system .
collectively , the data reviewed suggest that sal could be the responsible for the activation of the vta da neurons after ethanol administration .
however , to definitively link sal to ethanol - derived excitation of da mesolimbic system after ethanol consumption , it is compulsory resolving , at least , two important interrogations .
first , it is crucial to demonstrate the existence of an increase of vta sal levels after acute local or systemic ethanol administration .
second , it would be also decisive to establish a clear correlation between changes in vta sal levels and excitation of vta da neurons after ethanol administration .
future experiments on these crucial issues may be pivotal to unambiguously probe the involvement of sal in the excitation of da mesolimbic neurons after ethanol administration .

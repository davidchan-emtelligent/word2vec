sustained high concentration of glucose has been verified toxic to beta - cells .
glucose augments ca2 + - stimulated insulin release in pancreatic beta - cells , but chronic high concentration of glucose could induce a sustained level of ca2 + in beta - cells , which leads to cell apoptosis .
however , the mechanism of high glucose - induced beta - cell apoptosis remains unclear .
in this study , we use a calcium channel blocker , nifedipine , to investigate whether the inhibition of intracellular ca2 + concentration could protect beta - cells from chronic high glucose - induced apoptosis .
it was found that in a concentration of 33.3 mm , chronic stimulation of glucose could induce ins - 1 beta - cells apoptosis at least through the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway and 10 mum nifedipine inhibited ca2 + release to protect beta - cells from high glucose - induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis .
these results indicated that inhibition of ca2 + over - accumulation might provide benefit to attenuate islet beta - cell decompensation in a high glucose environment .
nifedipine ca2 + homeostasis beta - cell endoplasmic reticulum stress apoptosis high glucose 1 .
introduction type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) is characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance [ 1,2 ] and increased level of blood glucose concentration has been proposed to induce beta - cell loss in t2d [ 2 - 4 ] .
moreover , studies in cultured beta - cell and isolated islets have described that long - term exposure to a high concentration of glucose can trigger beta - cell apoptosis [ 5 - 7 ] .
in the process , cytochrome c release , caspase 3 activation might be the main cause of cell death [ 3,8 ] .
however , the molecular and cellular mechanisms of high concentration glucose - induced beta - cell apoptosis have not been well investigated .
some stress occurrence was involved in high glucose - induced beta - cell dysfunction , including oxidation stress , vasoactive cytokines release , barrier function changes , and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress [ 9 - 11 ] .
apoptotic er stress was demonstrated to be critical in high glucose - induced beta - cell apoptosis [ 12,13 ] .
in pancreatic beta - cells , er stress is induced by overloaded chaperons , increased misfolded proteins , er ca2 + depletion and failure of newly synthesized protein folding [ 14,15 ] .
such conditions could activate the unfolded protein response ( upr ) that inhibits new protein synthesis , increase folding capacity , and degrade misfolded proteins [ 16,17 ] .
in this process , a signal pathway such as pkr - like kinase ( perk ) was activated .
perk phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor2alpha ( eif2alpha ) , leads to inhibition of new protein translation [ 9,14,18 ] and the proapoptotic transcription factor , c / ebp homologous protein 10 ( chop ) , which mediates the lethal effect of perk signaling , is ubiquitously expressed at a very low level but robustly expressed under er stress condition [ 19 ] .
prolonged er stress leads to cell apoptosis , in which upr is not sufficient to deal with accumulated misfolded proteins [ 17,19 ] .
consistent ca2 + release from er stores by calcium influx is the main cause to elicit er stress to induce cell apoptosis by activating some apoptosis signals such as caspase - 3 , chop [ 20 ] .
in beta - cells , ca2 + is a key regulator not only in cell survival , but also in insulin release .
glucose could activate atp - dependent potassium channel [ 21 ] , which leads to membrane depolarization , and voltage - gated l - type ca2 + - channels are activated to stimulate intracellular ca2 + release from er stores , triggering insulin release [ 21,22 ] .
in t2d , consistent hyperglycemia stimulates sustained elevation of intracellular concentration of ca2 + ([ ca2 +] i ) for insulin secretion , which activates various ca2 + signals - related apoptosis pathways , including er stress [ 20,23,24 ] .
thus , inhibition of an elevated level of [ ca2 +] i might benefit t2d treatment .
to investigate the potential role of ca2 + in high concentrations of glucose - induced ins - 1 beta - cell apoptosis , nifedipine was utilized for efficacy studies , as one of l - type ca2 + - channel antagonists [ 25 ] .
in this study , we confirmed that ca2 + influx is strongly involved in high glucose - related beta - cell apoptosis via er stress pathway , and nifedipine could protect ins - 1 beta - cells from high glucose - induced er stress and apoptosis .

3. results 3.1 .
nifedipine protects ins - 1 cells from high glucose - induced apoptosis high concentration of glucose has been demonstrated to be toxic to cultured beta - cells [ 5 - 7 ] .
in a concentration of 33.3 mm , glucose inhibited the cell viability compared with 5.5 mm glucose treated group ( figure 1a ) .
however , 10 mum nifedipine suppressed this process significantly , which had no effect on 5.5 mm glucose cultured group ( figure 1a ) .
in addition , nifedipine could not promote cell viability in normal glucose concentration ( 11.1 mm ) , but the value of its viability was approximately two times more than other groups ( data not shown ) .
the reduction of cell viability under high glucose - treatment could be involved in increased cell apoptotsis .
to determine the apoptotic rate of treated ins - 1 cells , hoechst 33342 staining was performed .
the cells incubated with 33.3 mm glucose showed less live cells and highly condensed chromatin in nuclei ( figure 1b ) .
however , 10 mum nifedipine obviously decreased the apoptotic ratio in comparison with high glucose treated cells ( figure 1b ) .
furthermore , the result of tunel staining indicated that nifedipine prevented high glucose - induced ins - 1 cell apoptosis ( figure 1c ) .
taken together , it suggested that inhibition of calcium influx by l - type - ca2 + - channel antagonist could provide benefit to prevent high glucose - induced beta - cell apoptosis .
3.2 .
nifedipine prevents high glucose - induced beta - cell death through er stress pathway pancreatic beta - cell generates a highly developed er for ca2 + stores , insulin biosynthesis and secretion [ 18,30,31 ] .
thus , high glucose - induced beta - cell apoptosis could be closely related to the breakdown of ca2 + homeostasis , which was able to trigger er stress [ 32 ] .
to identify whether nifedipine protected ins - 1 cells from high glucose - induced apoptosis via er stress , the expression levels of some proteins involved in er stress pathway were analyzed by western blot .
as depicted in figure 2 , high glucose caused an elevated expression level of p - eif2alpha , chop and caspase 3 proteins after 24 h treatment .
however , these enhanced er stress markers were reduced by nifedipine ( figure 2 ) , suggesting that l - type - ca2 + - channel antagonists could suppress the high glucose - induced er stress in ins - 1 beta - cells line .
3.3 .
nifedipine improves the high glucose - impaired calcium homeostasis and gsis in ins - 1 cells chronic hyperglycemia is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of t2d [ 33,34 ] .
under physiological conditions , an increase in [ ca2 +] i in beta - cells is of crucial importance in coupling the gsis [ 35,36 ] .
thus , the l - type - ca2 + - channel antagonist , nifedipine , might inhibit the sustained increase in [ ca2 +] i. we had investigated the effect of nifedipine on the calcium influx in ins - 1 beta - cells .
nifedipine could dose - dependently inhibit calcium influx in ins - 1 cells ( figure 3a ) .
when cells were treated for 6 h , high glucose promoted the activation of calcium influx and gsis function ( figure 3b,d ) .
however , in long - term incubation , the function of calcium influx was impaired by high glucose , which was protected by nifedipine ( figure 3b ) .
similarly , high glucose - impaired insulin content and gsis in ins - 1 cells were also protected by nifedipine ( figure 3c,d ) .
it seemed that intracellular calcium homeostasis played an important role in insulin secretion and synthesis .
insulin release in pancreatic beta - cells was through the modulation of calcium influx , but the accumulation of excessive calcium would damage cells function , eventually leading to the beta - cells apoptosis .
thus , nifedipine could partially prevent high glucose - induced ins - 1 cell dysfunction through the regulation of adequate calcium levels .
however , the abrogation of l - type - ca2 + - channel activation did not completely prevent ins - 1 cells from high glucose - induced apoptosis , suggesting that this event may not be totally dependent on calcium homeostasis .
4. discussion sustained high glucose in vivo may disturb calcium metabolism in islet beta - cells [ 37 ] , which was a possible cause of hyperinsulinism in the development of diabetes mellitus .
calcium homeostasis is also important to the diversity of cellular processes including proliferation and apoptosis [ 38 ] .
nifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker , which has been used as antianginal and antihypertensive [ 39 ] .
recently , it has been reported that nifedipine prevented induced apoptosis in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells [ 40,41 ] .
the l - type ca2 + channel has been reportedly expressed in ins - 1 beta - cells [ 42,43 ] , and beta - cells were also thought to be sensitive to calcium channel blockers [ 44 ] , and jeffrey et al. demonstrated that blocking ca2 + influx with nifedipine could abolish the palmitate - induced er stress [ 45 ] .
accordingly , in obesity or hyperglycemia associated t2d , the sustained elevation of [ ca2 +] i is able to generate cell death , and calcium channel antagonists could protect beta - cells from palmitate - induced apoptosis [ 46 ] .
however , the relationship between calcium channel and high glucose - induced cell apoptosis has not been fully understood .
both free fatty acids ( ffa ) - amplified insulin secretion and the gsis itself depend on calcium influx through calcium channels [ 47,48 ] .
thus , calcium influx could be a critical mediator not only in high ffa - induced beta - cell dysfunction , but also in high glucose - induced impaired beta - cells .
in addition , previous studies had shown that high glucose - induced apoptosis occurred through store - operated calcium entry and calcineurin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and calcium channel blocker ( diltiazem ) inhibits apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cell exposed to high glucose concentration [ 49,50 ] .
our studies had verified that the calcium channel blocker , nifedipine , could reverse high glucose - induced beta - cell dysfunction and apoptosis .
as a result of hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia in t2d , increased beta - cell ca2 + flux could play a key role in the failure of beta - cells .
during the pre - diabetic state , pancreatic beta - cells might trigger a compensatory phase [ 51,52 ] .
in this phase , an elevated [ ca2 +] i could activate increased insulin output to adapt elevated glucose or ffa level [ 34,52 ] .
however , long - term hyperinsulinemia will exhaust beta - cells , and various ca2 + signals related to apoptosis are activated , such as pkr - like kinase ( perk ) pathway [ 9,14 ] .
in our results , perk phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor2alpha led to inhibition of new protein translation [ 18 ] .
in the process , a proapoptotic transcription factor , chop was up - regulated and activated death - related er stress [ 20,53 ] .
finally , caspase 3 was activated and cytochrome c release generated cell death .
nifedipine was reported to inhibit calcium influx [ 54 ] and suppressed glucose stimulated insulin secretion [ 42,54 - 56 ] in pancreatic beta - cells and islets , but in the long term , exposure to high glucose , the dysfunction of calcium influx and insulin secretion in beta - cells occurs .
however , nifedipine might prevent this compensation mechanism , which protects beta - cells from glucose - induced dysfunction , and partially due to the regulation of insulin secretion and blocking of calcium - induced apoptotic signal .
in conclusion , high glucose induces beta - cell apoptosis which is highly dependent on calcium influx and calcium influx might be of crucial importance in the apoptosis process via er stress pathway .
our results indicated that inhibition of calcium channel could benefit prevention of cell apoptosis , and suggest that the suppression of beta - cell compensation might be beneficial in t2d .

5.5 mm glucose with ( black bar ) or without ( white bar ) nifedipine had no change in od .
33.3 mm glucose ( grey bar ) significantly reduced the cell viability , 10 mum nifedipine reversed this effect ; ( b ) nifedipine protected ins - 1 cells from high glucose - induced apoptosis .
cells were divided into four groups as described above , hoechst 33342 staining was performed to calculate the apoptotic rate , data was repeated at least three times , scale bar = 50 mum , and referred to all panels ; ( c ) tunel staining of apoptotic cells .
apoptotic cells were marked with green fluorescence , the nuclei of cells are stained by blue fluorescence , data was repeated at least three times , scale bar = 50 mum , and referred to all panels .
data was shown as mean +/ - se of three independent trails each performed with triplicate samples .
the statistics graph shows * p < 0.05 compared to 33.3 mm glucose treated group .
figure 2 western blot analysis of protein level of er stress in ins - 1 cells .
cells were divided into four groups as described above .
after treatment , cell lysate was collected and subjected to western blot .
each blot was replicated at least three times .
figure 3 ( a ) the effects of nifedipine and glucose on [ ca2 +] i level and glucose stimulated insulin secretion ( gsis ) .
in acute [ ca2 +] i determination , nifedipine significant inhibited the calcium influx in 33.3 mm glucose stimulation dosedependently ; ( b ) after 6 h treatment , 33.3 mm glucose ( dark grey bar ) stimulated calcium influx , and 10 mum nifedipine ( grey bar ) partially prevented this effect .
24 h 33.3 mm glucose treatment impaired the calcium influx in ins - 1 cells , but nifedipine partly inhibited this effect ; ( c ) the insulin content of ins - 1 cells was marked with green fluorescence , 24 h incubation of 33.3 mm glucose obviously reduced the content of intracellular insulin in ins - 1 cells .
scale bar = 25 mum , and refers to all panels ; ( d ) gsis in nifedipine and glucose incubated ins - 1 cells .
after 24 h treatment , 33.3 mm glucose ( dark grey bar ) impaired gsis of ins - 1 cells , and 10 mum nifedipine ( grey bar ) partially prevented this effect .
* p < 0.05 compared to 33.3 mm glucose treated group .

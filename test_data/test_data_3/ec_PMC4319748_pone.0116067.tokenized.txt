diabetes is the most common and complex metabolic disorder , and one of the most important health threats now .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are a group of small non - coding rnas that have been suggested to play a vital role in a variety of physiological processes , including glucose homeostasis .
in this study , we investigated the role of mir - 185 in diabetes .
mir - 185 was significantly downregulated in diabetic patients and mice , and the low level was correlated to blood glucose concentration .
overexpression of mir - 185 enhanced insulin secretion of pancreatic beta - cells , promoted cell proliferation and protected cells from apoptosis .
further experiments using in silico prediction , luciferase reporter assay and western blot assay demonstrated that mir - 185 directly targeted socs3 by binding to its 3 ' - utr .
on the contrary to mir - 185 's protective effects , socs3 significantly suppressed functions of beta - cell and inactivated stat3 pathway .
when treating cells with mir - 185 mimics in combination with socs3 overexpression plasmid , the inhibitory effects of socs3 were reversed .
while combined treatment of mir - 185 mimics and socs3 sirna induced synergistically promotive effects compared to either mir - 185 mimics or socs3 sirna treatment alone .
moreover , we observed that mir - 185 level was inversely correlated with socs3 expression in diabetes patients .
in conclusion , this study revealed a functional and mechanistic link between mir - 185 and socs3 in the pathogenesis of diabetes .
mir - 185 plays an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion and beta - cell growth in diabetes .
restoration of mir - 185 expression may serve a potentially promising and efficient therapeutic approach for diabetes .

introduction diabetes mellitus ( dm ) is a complex and multisystem disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resulting from either a lack of insulin production or resistance to insulin [ 1 ] .
the rapidly emerging diabetes pandemic has been one of the most challenging threats to public health in the 21st century .
it is reported that currently , 382 million adults worldwide are living with diabetes , and the estimate is projected to rise to more than 592 million by 2035 [ 2 ] .
life expectancy of a person diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 40 is estimated to be shortened by about 6 - 7 years , compared with people without type 2 diabetes [ 3 ] .
to prevent and manage diabetes , at least 147 billion dollars were spent on diabetes health care in europe in 2013 , and north america and the caribbean spent about 263 billion [ 4 ] .
thus , to completely understand mechanisms of diabetes development , and develop efficient therapy is of great importance .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are a family of small (~ 22 nucleotide ) , non - coding single - strand rnas which functions through negatively regulating a variety of gene expressions [ 5 ] .
mature mirnas exert effects by integrating into an rna - inducing silencing complex ( risc ) and binding to specific complementary sites within 3 ' untranslated regions ( 3 ' - utr ) of their target genes , to inhibit translation or directly induce degradation [ 6 ] .
growing evidences have implied that mirnas are involved in pathogenesis of many diseases , including diabetes and its various complications [ 7 ] , infections [ 8 ] and types of cancers [ 9 ] .
many studies have identified specific mirna expression profiles of diabetes , and described the critical roles of mirnas in pancreatic development and function [ 10 ] .
for example , mir - 375 is one of the most abundant mirnas present in pancreatic islet cells and negatively regulates glucose - stimulated insulin secretion .
inhibition of mir - 375 enhances insulin secretion , while mir - 375 overexpression impairs the insulin secretory pathway by reducing expression of myotrophin [ 11 ] .
mir - 375 also targets insulin gene expression and down - regulates phosphoinositide - dependent protein kinase - 1 , resulting in decreased insulin - induced phosphorylation of akt and gsk3 [ 12 ] .
oppositely , mir - 9 and mir - 96 have inhibitory roles in insulin secretion. by targeting onecut2 and noc2 respectively , mir - 9 and mir - 96 up - regulate granuphilin , and negatively regulate insulin exocytosis [ 13 , 14 ] .
although many mirnas have already been identified , their roles in the regulation of key genes and signaling pathways associated with diabetes pathology still remain largely unknown .
mir - 185 and its role in cell biology first came to light when a connection was discovered between mir - 185 expression and cancer progression [ 15 ] .
moreover , it was reported recently that mir - 185 - mediated inhibition of ldl uptake and hmg - coa reductase activity is involved in dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis , which is associated with various metabolic diseases , including diabetes [ 16 ] .
however , the exact clinical - pathologic correlations and biological functions of mir - 185 in diabetes have not been characterized .
in this study , we confirmed the regulatory relationship between mir - 185 and socs3 , a member of the stat - induced stat inhibitor .
our results showed that mir - 185 could induce insulin secretion and suppress pancreatic cells apoptosis by directly targeting socs3 .
restoration of mir - 185 expression may have an important implication for the clinical management of diabetes .

mir - 185 enhances insulin secretion and total insulin content to analyze the functions of mir - 185 in regulating metabolism , we induced alterations of cellular mir - 185 level in the glucose - responsive murine pancreatic beta - cell line min6 cells , and measured gsis and insulin content .
as shown in fig. 2 , insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulus was decreased in cells transfected with mir - 185 inhibitor ( fig. 2a , b ) , and increased in cells transfected with mir - 185 mimics ( fig. 2e , f ) compared with the indicated controls .
these data indicated that mir - 185 was an inducer of glucose - stimulated insulin secretion .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0116067.g002 fig 2 effects of mir - 185 on beta - cell function and cell growth .
loss of mir - 185 reduced total insulin content ( a ) , inhibited glucose stimulated insulin secretion ( b ) , reduced cell proliferation and viability ( c ) , and stimulated cell apoptosis ( d ) .
inversely , elevated mir - 185 increased total insulin content ( e ) , glucose stimulated insulin secretion ( f ) , promoted cell proliferation and viability ( g ) , and repressed cell apoptosis ( h ) .
(** p < 0.01 , * p < 0.05 , figure is representative of 3 experiments with similar results. ) mir - 185 protects pancreatic cells from impairment the ability of mir - 185 on regulating cell growth was determined by proliferation assay , viability assay , and apoptosis assay .
loss of mir - 185 significantly decreased the growth rate and viability of min6 cells compared with control cells ( fig. 2c ) .
while cells treated with mir - 185 mimics showed a dramatic increase in proliferation and viability ( fig. 2g ) .
apoptotic rate was analyzed by flow cytometry .
the results showed that the rate of apoptosis was significantly higher in cells with lower level of mir - 185 ( fig. 2d ) .
however , it was remarkably decreased when mir - 185 was overexpressed ( fig. 2h ) .
mir - 185 directly targets socs3 four publicly available bioinformatic algorithms ( targetscan , pictar , miranda , microrna.org ) were used to analyze target genes of mir - 185 .
the results showed that socs3 was a theoretical target gene of mir - 185 in different species , including human , mouse and rat ( fig. 3a ) .
further we subcloned the wild type socs3 3 ' - utr fragment containing the mir - 185 binding site or a corresponding mutant fragment into the pgl3 - basic luciferase reporter vector respectively .
cotransfection with mir - 185 mimics decreased luciferase activities of the wt - socs3 construct , but no change of luciferase activity was observed with the mutant construct ( fig. 3b ) .
consistently , pcr and western blot analyses showed that the mrna and protein levels of socs3 were both dramatically up - regulated in mir - 185 konckdown cells , but were downregulated when mir - 185 was overexpressed ( fig. 3c and d ) .
it is reported that socs3 , a member of stat inhibitor , is involved in negative regulation of the jak / stat pathway [ 20 ] .
thus we further detected activation of the stat3 pathway .
at the same time as socs3 was up - regulated by mir - 185 inhibitor transfection , expression of phospho - stat3 was significantly inhibited ( fig. 3c right ) .
but when socs3 was repressed , phospho - stat3 increased notably ( fig. 3d right ) .
other stat family members , including stat1 and stat5 were also determined in response to the changes of mirna - 185 .
levels of phospho - stat1 followed the same trends as stat3 , but phospho - stat5 remained unchanged in both the above two conditions .
taken together , these results suggested mir - 185 could inhibit socs3 expression at transcriptional level .

(** p < 0.01 , * p < 0.05 , figure is representative of 3 experiments with similar results. ) the effects of mir - 185 on the pancreatic cells is mediated by socs3 to further confirm the potential relationship between mir - 185 and the downstream gene socs3 , we next restored the expression of socs3 in mir - 185 - overexpressing min6 cells by cotransfection of socs3 expression vector and mir - 185 mimics .
when single socs3 gene was re - expressed ( fig. 4a ) , transfected min6 cells exhibited decreased glucose - stimulated insulin secretion ( fig. 4b and c ) , inhibited cell growth and viability ( fig. 4d and e ) , and induced apoptosis ( fig. 4f ) , which were in consistent with the inhibitory effects induced by downregulation of mir - 185 .
activation of stat3 pathway was also suppressed by socs3 .
while co - expression of mir - 185 and socs3 remarkably reversed the above inhibitory effects compared with transfection with socs3 alone .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0116067.g004 fig 4 functional effects of socs3 on pancreatic beta - cells .
( a ) socs3 protein expression was effectively elevated by transfection with socs3 expression vector and knockdown by transfection with socs3 sirna respectively .
stat3 pathway was suppressed by socs3 .
elevated socs3 decreased total insulin content ( b ) and glucose - stimulated insulin secretion ( c ) , inhibited cell growth ( d ) , and induced cell apoptosis ( e ) .
note that co - expression of mir - 185 mimics and socs3 overexpression vector remarkably reversed the above inhibitory effects compared with transfection with socs3 alone and note the synergistic promotive effects induced by combination of mir - 185 mimics and socs3 sirna compared with either of them alone .
(** p < 0.01 , * p < 0.05 , figure is representative of 3 experiments with similar results. ) furthermore , socs3 expression was repressed by sirna transfection ( fig. 4a ) to block the socs3 - mir - 185 interaction .
as shown in fig. 4 , when treating cells with socs3 sirna in combination with mir - 185 mimics , a synergistic inhibitory effect on socs3 expression was observed ( fig. 4a ) .
consistently , transfected cells shown increased insulin secretion ( fig. 4b and c ) , promoted cell growth and viability ( fig. 4d and e ) , and reduced apoptosis ( fig. 4f ) .
taken together , these results indicated that mir - 185 played a protective role in pancreatic cells through regulating socs3 expression .
the effects of mir - 185 on the pancreatic cells involve stat3 protein as socs3 is a member of stat inhibitor , thus we further investigated whether stat3 protein participated in regulation of mir - 185 on pancreatic cell function .
recombinant il - 6 was used to induce stat3 activation ( fig. 5a top left corner ) , and treatment of mir - 185 overexpressed cells with il - 6 resulted in much more insulin secretion ( fig. 5b and c ) , cell growth and viability ( fig. 5d and e ) , and even less apoptosis ( fig. 5f ) .

recombinant il - 6 was used to induce stat3 activation ( a top left corner ) .
il - 6 treatment in mir - 185 overexpressed cells resulted in more insulin secretion ( b and c ) , cell growth and viability ( d and e ) , and less apoptosis ( f ) compared with mir - 185 overexpressed cells without il - 6 stimulation .
(** p < 0.01 , figure is representative of 3 experiments with similar results. ) expression of mir - 185 was clinically correlated with socs3 to confirm the clinical relevance between mir - 185 and socs3 expression , we investigated the plasma expression of socs3 protein by elisa in the recruited patients and controls .
expression of socs3 was much higher in patients with diabetes than those with ifg / igt or ngt ( fig. 6a ) .
consistently , a significantly negative correlation between expression of mir - 185 and socs3 was observed ( r = - 0.5224 , p = 0.0151 , fig. 6b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0116067.g006 fig 6 expression of mir - 185 was clinically correlated with socs3 .
( a ) the plasma expression of socs3 was determined by elisa .
expression of socs3 was higher in patients with diabetes than those with ifg / igt or ngt .
( b ) expression of mir - 185 was inversely correlated with socs3 ( spearman 's correlation , r = - 0.5224 , p = 0.0151 ) .
discussion diabetes is the most common and complex metabolic disorder .
it is known that type 1 diabetes mellitus results from insulin deficiency , usually secondary to autoimmune beta - cell destruction [ 21 ] ; and type 2 diabetes mellitus requires defects in both beta - cell function and insulin sensitivity [ 22 ] .
but the mechanism driven beta - cell dysfunction is largely unknown .
quite recently , using next - generation sequencing , a catalog of mirnas was identified in human pancreatic islets and enriched beta - cells , and the overlap between these mirnas and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis was explored [ 23 ] .
studies on pancreatic development and function have implicated the critical role of mirnas in these processes by the mechanism that mirna could regulate a variety of genes pivotal for apoptosis and glucose - stimulated insulin secretion [ 10 ] .
another plasma - based microarray screening also described many circulating mirnas associated with diabetes [ 24 ]. of these deregulated mirnas in diabetes specific mirna profile , mir - 185 was differentially expressed in diabetes .
further study showed that mir - 185 regulated selective lipid uptake and is involved in major pathway of lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism [ 16 , 25 ] .
based on these findings , we speculated that mir - 185 might participate in diabetes development .
our results obtained from qpcr validation in patients with different levels of glucose showed that there was a gradual decrease in plasma levels of mir - 185 across categories of normal glucose tolerance , impaired fasting glucose / impaired glucose tolerance and manifest diabetes .
mouse model of diabetes induced by streptozotocin also presented significantly lower level of mir - 185 in pancreatic islets .
further we restored mir - 185 expression in the glucose - responsive murine pancreatic beta - cell line , min6 , and found that mir - 185 inhibited beta - cell dysfunction by enhancing insulin secretion and total insulin content , inducing cell growth , and inhibiting cell apoptosis .
while when transfected with mir inhibitors to knockdown mir - 185 , min6 cells exhibited decreased insulin secretion and growth , as well as stimulated apoptosis .
these findings suggested that mir - 185 was involved in the processes of diabetes pathogenesis .
previous study about mir - 185 mainly focused on its regulation of cancer progression .
in ovarian cancers , pediatric renal tumors and multiple breast cancer cell lines , mir - 185 sensitizes resistant cancer cells to trail - mediated apoptosis [ 26 ] .
when mir - 185 was up - regulated , the apoptotic gastric cancer cells were significantly increased in response to cisplatin or doxorubicin , demonstrating that mir - 185 enhances the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy [ 27 ] .
mir - 185 also suppressed the proliferation potential and tumor growth in multiple types of cancer , including colorectal cancer [ 28 ] , non - small - cell lung cancer [ 29 ] and ovarian cancer [ 26 ] .
these investigations implied that mir - 185 was possibly related to apoptosis .
our results , inconsistent with these conclusion derived from study based on cancer , show a promotive role of mir - 185 in growth of pancreatic cells , indicating different molecular network functioning in diabetes compared with cancer .
the suppressor of cytokine signaling ( socs ) family was first discovered in 1997 and is referred to as signal transducer and activation of transcription ( stat ) - induced stat inhibitors [ 30 ] .
it has been shown that socs3 is important in the development of leptin resistance , and inhibition of insulin is mediated by several socs proteins , especially socs3 [ 31 , 32 ] .
elevation of intracellular socs3 levels blocks insulin signaling through ubiquitin - mediated degradation of ir substrate proteins , which share signaling cascades of jak2 / stat3 with leptin receptors [ 32 , 33 ] .
in human aortic endothelial cells , increased camp induces socs3 protein expression , leading to leptin inhibition and il - 6 - stumulated phosphorylation of stat3 [ 34 ] .
in mouse model of insulin resistance induced by high - fat diet , liver - specific knockdown of fgf - 21 resulted in increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis by activating glucose - 6 - phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase via the stat3 / socs3 pathway , which ultimately led to exacerbation of hepatic insulin resistance [ 35 ] .
socs3 also plays important role in cellular proliferation and apoptosis .
socs3 restoration by a demethylating agent in methylated pancreatic cells remarkably suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of cells [ 36 ] .
in contrast , inhibition of socs3 promoted ifn - alpha - induced cell death and growth suppression in renal cell carcinoma [ 37 ] .
our results are consistent with these previous findings , and more importantly , we confirmed an important molecular relationship between mir - 185 and socs3 .
upregulation of mir - 185 expression effectively suppressed socs3 expression at both mrna and protein levels , whereas , downregulation of mir - 185 induced socs3 expression , suggesting a potential inverse relevance between mir - 185 and socs3 in diabetes .
consistently , a negative correlation between mir - 185 and socs3 was observed in plasma samples of patients with diabetes .
mir - 185 directly targeted socs3 gene through binding to specific complementary site within 3 ' - utr of socs3 mrna , and the effects of mir - 185 on pancreatic cells is mediated by socs3 .
taken together , these findings demonstrated that mir - 185 played a protective role in diabetes , at least , in part due to directly inhibiting socs3 expression .
although the insulin therapy has improved the lives of all people affected by diabetes , it is still one of the most challenging health problems worldwide , with high incidences of many complications .
our findings suggest that mir - 185 significantly induces insulin secretion and pancreatic cell growth , by targeting socs3 and regulating stat3 pathway .
patients with diabetes presented much lower level of mir - 185 , and the decreased level correlated with blood glucose concentration .
thus , our results implicate that mir - 185 can be considered as a candidate for diabetes treatment , and the therapeutic effects of mir - 185 warrants exploration .

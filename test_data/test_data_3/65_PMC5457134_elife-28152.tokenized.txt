2017. il17 factors are early regulators in the gut epithelium during inflammatory response to vibrio in the sea urchin larva .
elife 6 : e23481 .
doi : 10.7554 / elife.23481 in 1882 , elie metchnikoff peered through a microscope at a starfish larva and observed migrating cells engulf a splinter .
he named these cells ' phagocytes ' , and they inspired the idea that certain cells defend the organism by eating foreign invaders ( metchnikoff , 1893 ) .
metchnikoff 's phagocytosis theory described a new dimension of immunity and earned him a nobel prize in 1908 ( tauber , 2003 ) .
starfish are echinoderms - a set of marine animals that also includes sea urchins .
nearly 100 years after metchnikoff identified phagocytes , a team of scientists sequenced the urchin genome and made a startling discovery : several families of innate immune molecules had more than 200 members , which was much greater than anything encountered in previously sequenced animal genomes ( sea urchin genome sequencing consortium et al. , 2006 ) .
as the genomes of additional species were sequenced , a picture emerged indicating that innate immune systems of echinoderms and other invertebrates rely on a genomic complexity not seen in mammals .
encoded in the genome of many animals are molecules called cytokines that play important signaling roles in the immune system .
now , in elife , jonathan rast , katherine buckley and co - workers at the university of toronto and sunnybrook research institute - including buckley and eric ho as joint first authors - report unexpected results regarding a cytokine called il - 17 in echinoderm larvae ( buckley et al. , 2017 ) .
immunologists focus a lot of attention on how cytokines control immune cells , but they ( the cytokines , not the immunologists ) can also work on other cell types .
for example , in mice and humans , il - 17 acts almost entirely on the epithelial cells that line body cavities and the mesenchymal cells that make up connective tissue .
in response to il - 17 , the cells trigger inflammation - an important part of the early immune response ( amatya et al. , 2017 ) .
while buckley et al. did not set out to study il - 17 , they were interested in how urchins deal with bacteria in their guts .
urchin larvae feed by filtering microbe - rich seawater , and should therefore have robust gut immune responses .
the larvae are transparent , which allowed buckley et al. to watch as the same cell types that enthralled metchnikoff engulfed bacteria in the gut .
yet even before the infection was visible , immune cells migrated to the gut and the gut epithelium thickened and closed off .
this indicated an early , systemic immune response .
further investigation revealed that the urchin versions of il - 17 were some of the most highly expressed genes immediately after an infection .
this raised the question of whether il - 17 has an ancient role as a regulator of gut microbial responses .
for most cytokines it would be difficult , if not impossible , to find the answer .
cytokines evolve so quickly that it is hard to identify which are homologs ( i.e. which genes share a common ancestor ) .
il - 17 , however , has several highly conserved motifs that allowed buckley et al. to identify 35 members of the il - 17 family in urchins. by contrast , mice and humans only have six members ( amatya et al. , 2017 ) .
these 35 cytokines cluster into ten subgroups , dubbed spil17 - 1 through spil17 - 10 .
remarkably , the subgroups appear in four other echinoderm species that span over 260 million years of evolution .
this conservation suggests each family has a distinct and essential role .
unfortunately , more than 500 million years of evolution separates echinoderms and mammals , which prevents us from establishing the evolutionary relationships between individual urchin and mammalian genes , even for il - 17 .
buckley et al. next assembled a detailed picture of il - 17 expression in both adult urchins and larvae .
all il - 17s were completely inactive in healthy larvae , but four hours after an infection the activity of two families - spil17 - 1 and spil17 - 4 - dramatically increased .
subsequently , several other immune genes were activated , including two hallmarks of inflammation .
a series of cellular localization experiments further demonstrated that gut epithelial cells - and not immune cells - express il - 17 cytokines .
buckley et al. then combined publicly available data with their own experiments to show that in adult urchins , spil17 - 1 and spil17 - 4 are inactive during bacterial infections .
instead , a different family ( spil17 - 9 ) increases its activity , which is followed by the expression of several echinoderm - specific defense molecules. with 35 il - 17 - like cytokines in the genome , one might expect a similar diversity of il - 17 receptors .
however , buckley et al. found only two .
blocking the translation of one of the receptor types was lethal for the larvae .
blocking the other receptor - termed il - 17r1 - reduced the expression of several ( but not all ) immune response genes , and did not prevent immune cell migration .
other pathways of immune activation must therefore exist .
these findings raise a number of questions .
why do echinoderms have ten il - 17 families yet apparently only two receptors ?
do additional il - 17 receptors that lack homology to their vertebrate counterparts exist ?
how does the gut epithelium sense bacteria to trigger an immune response ?
one can expect that recent demonstrations of crispr / cas9 mediated genome editing in urchins will help researchers to seek answers to these questions ( lin and su , 2016 ) .
more fundamentally , does the production of il - 17 by epithelial cells represent an ancestral immune state in animals ?
the answer could be yes .
nearly everything we know about mammalian il - 17 signaling comes from studies of a subfamily called il - 17a , which is secreted by immune cells , but several other il - 17s are produced by gut epithelial cells ( song et al. , 2011 ) .
in summary , these results reinforce the idea that we should study host immune defenses across the animal tree in order to discover general properties of immune systems ( litman and cooper , 2007 ) .
buckley et al. have achieved this by peering into an echinoderm .
metchnikoff would approve .
competing interests the author declares that no competing interests exist .

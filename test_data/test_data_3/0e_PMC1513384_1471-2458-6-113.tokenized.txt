background public health authorities worldwide discourage the use of chest radiography as a screening modality , as the diagnostic performance of chest radiography does not justify its application for screening and may even be harmful , since people with false positive results may experience anxiety and concern .
despite the accumulated evidence , various reports suggest that primary care physicians throughout the world still prescribe chest radiography for screening .
we therefore set out to index the use of chest radiography for screening purposes among the healthy adult population and to analyze its relationship with possible trigger factors .
methods the study was designed as a cross - sectional survey .
five thousand four hundred and ninety - nine healthy adults , coming from 26 greek provinces were surveyed for screening practice habits in the nationwide anticancer study .
data were obtained for the use of screening chest radiography .
impact of age , gender , tobacco exposure , family history positive for malignancies and professional - risk for lung diseases was further analyzed .
results we found that 20 % ( n = 1099 ) of the surveyed individuals underwent chest radiography for screening purposes for at least one time during the previous three years .
among those , 24 % do so with a frequency equal or higher than once yearly , and 48 % with a frequency equal or higher than every three years .
screening for chest radiography was more commonly adopted among males ( or 1.130 , 95 % ci 0.988 - 1.292 ) , pensioners ( or 1.319 , ci 1.093 - 1.593 ) and individuals with a positive family history for lung cancer ( or 1.251 , ci 0.988 - 1.583 ) .
multivariate analysis confirmed these results .
conclusion despite formal recommendations , chest radiography for screening purposes was a common practice among the analyzed sample of greek adults .
this practice is of questionable value since the positive predictive value of chest radiography is low .
the implementation of even a relatively inexpensive imaging study on a national scale would greatly burden health economics and the workload of radiology departments .
background chest radiography has a long tradition in medical care , however its prescription for screening purposes among healthy individuals is discouraged by public health authorities [ 1 - 5 ] .
in fact , due to the low prevalence of tuberculosis in developed countries and the incapability to modify lung cancer - specific mortality , the use of chest radiography as a screening tool is not effective .
the diagnostic performance of chest radiography does not justify its application for screening neither in the general population nor in " high risk " groups like smokers or people with a family history of lung cancer [ 6,7 ] .
screening chest radiography is not considered effective , it does not have a high yield , and false positive exams result in additional and unnecessary medical tests , associated economic costs , and patient anxiety and stress [ 6,7 ] .
despite the accumulated evidence and the clear guidelines , various reports suggest that primary care physicians throughout the world still prescribe chest radiography for screening both in the general population and in selected " high risk " subgroups [ 8 - 16 ] .
consequently , screening chest radiography may represent a major problem that harms screenees' health , and burdens public - health economics and radiology departments' activities .
nevertheless , since the proportion of physicians believing in and recommending a screening test may consistently differ from the proportion of healthy individuals undergoing the test ( still dependent on patients' will ) , the negative impact of screening chest radiography on health and economics may be only speculated .
little is in fact known in peer - reviewed literature about how chest radiography for screening purposes is practiced among the general healthy adult population [ 16 - 18 ] .
we therefore tried to evaluate the rate of screening chest radiography practice among a large sample of greek healthy adults .
furthermore , we analyzed the resulting chest radiography screening practice for the impact of professional risk for lung diseases , family history of cancer and smoking practice .
methods pacmer _ 02 trial this study is part of a large ongoing survey on cancer screening and preventive practice in greece , which is organized by pacmer ( panhellenic association for continual medical research ) , and has the purpose to reveal the current rate of cancer screening among the greek adult population , to evidence possible barriers to early diagnosis of cancer and to analyze over - practice events and possible sources of worthless costs .
for the project , pacmer physicians had dedicatedly prepared two medical questionnaires ( one for male and one for female ) for face - to - face interviews that were employed during the research program .
the exact phrasing of the chest radiography questions used is provided in the supplementary note for the facilitation of the peer - review process .
the project was ethically approved by pacmer 's scientific committee ( protocol number 08 _ 020720 ) and conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 declaration of helsinki .
a written informed consent form was obtained from all the participants before completing the study questionnaire and the data retrieved were analyzed in anonymous and codified form .
population and data extraction the study population was composed of a nationwide convenience sample : adults bringing or visiting their relatives while getting healthcare in hospitals and health centers of 26 greek provinces ( fig. 1 ) .
most populated greek areas were involved in the study , including more than 80 % of the greek population .
five thousand four hundred and ninety - nine individuals ( 2948 female , 2551 male , age range 21 - 97 ) entered the study and answered the questionnaires during a face - to - face interview between 2000 and 2004 .
ninety - two physicians employed in primary care activities were involved in the study , 87 of them as interviewers , and five as data managers and quality control personnel .
data storing was assured by sesy , a dedicated database [ 19,20 ] tailored to population - based cross - sectional surveys for cancer prevention and screening assessment .
data were extracted for overall chest radiography practice .
for each individual we retrieved the chronological period that elapsed from the last chest radiography and the cause for which chest radiography was performed .
we further evaluated the proportion of individuals who assessed that they underwent chest radiogram last time for screening purposes .
for people who performed it within three years we still analyzed the frequency by which they underwent the test .
definition since the diagnostic performance of chest radiography does not justify its application in any screening setting , we considered chest radiography being done for screening purposes in any of the following situations : 1 ) periodic health examination ( conducted at regular intervals , e.g. yearly ) ; 2 ) check - up visit ( requested by individuals who do not undergo health examination at regular intervals ) ; 3 ) chest radiography in asymptomatic individuals due to patients' will ; 4 ) regulatory reasons ( driving license , health certificate etc. ) .
subgroup analysis we analyzed the rate of screening chest radiography by the following parameters : age (< 45 , 45 - 64 , 65 - 74 and > 75 years old ) , professional category ( pensioners , professions at risk for lung diseases and other professions ) , cancer family history , smoking activity ( no smokers , smokers , ex smokers ) , number of daily cigarettes smoked (< 10 , 10 - 20 , 20 - 30 , 30 - 40 , > 40 , no smokers ) , duration of tobacco exposure (< 10 , 10 - 20 , 20 - 30 , 30 - 40 , > 40 years ) .
statistical analysis in order to evidence population subgroups at higher probability of undergoing screening chest radiography , we performed univariate and multivariate analysis .
only subjects for whom there were data about the time elapsed from last chest radiography and about the reason for which they underwent chest radiograms , were considered ( n = 5282 ) .
individuals entering the analysis were therefore divided in : ( 1 ) subjects at higher probability of undergoing screening chest radiography : people who performed chest radiography for screening purposes ( regulatory reason excluded ) within the last three years ( n = 1080 ) ; ( 2 ) subjects at lower probability of undergoing screening chest radiography exposure : individuals who underwent chest radiography for any other reason ( than screening ) at any time and those who underwent chest radiograms for screening purposes but more than 3 years had elapsed ( n = 4202 ) .
univariate analysis was used in order to examine the association between over - practice and all subgroups previously defined .
multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between over - practice and some relevant covariates of interest : sex , age , professional category , smoke and family history of lung cancer .
all independent variables were taken as categorical , dichotomized where appropriate .
we used sas statistical package , version 8.2 [ 21 ] , for analyses at 95 % confidence intervals .
results population the characteristics of the individuals involved in the study are reported in table 1 .
the mean age of individuals who entered the study was 60.35 years .
there was a significant difference in the age distribution of female and male individuals involved in the survey ( chi32 = 332.89 p < 0.001 ) largely driven by the higher proportion of women included in the age group < 45 years old ( 14.3 % for women vs 2.3 % for men ) .
the mean age of male individuals involved in the study was consistently higher than the mean age of women : 63.4 years old ( standard error 0.19 ) versus 57.7 years old ( standard error 0.21 ) ( table 1 ) .
chest radiography patterns 76.6 % of the population analyzed ( n = 4212 ) referred that they underwent at least one chest radiogram during their life ; 29.5 % ( n = 1622 ) assessed that they underwent it last time for screening purposes ; 43.4 % ( n = 2385 ) performed it in out - patient basis for medical reasons ; and 3.7 % ( n = 205 ) underwent it in in - patient basis .
among people who underwent chest radiography for screening purposes , ( table 2 ) we found that 19.98 % ( 1099 individuals ; 537 males and 562 females ) did so within a three - year period .
among those ( information available for 936 out of 1099 ) , 24.15 % ( n = 226 ) underwent it with a frequency equal or higher than once yearly and 47.97 % ( n = 449 ) with a frequency equal or higher than every three years .
details on frequencies are reported in table 3 .
subgroup analysis univariate analyses evidenced that the risk of screening radiogram performance was statistically higher among pensioners ( or 1.319 , 95 % ci 1.093 - 1.593 ) .
trends to higher chest x - ray practice were still found among individuals of male gender ( or 1.130 , 95 % ci 0.988 - 1.292 ) and those with a family history positive for lung cancer ( or 1.251 , 95 % ci 0.988 - 1.583 ) , although these trends were not statistically significant .
interestingly people with professions at risk for lung diseases showed lower probability to undergo screening chest radiograms ( or 0.846 , 95 % ci 0.713 - 1.003 ) .
chest radiography performance for screening purposes was not influenced by age , tobacco consumption , and family history positive for malignancies ( table 4 ) .
multivariate analysis confirmed the results obtained by univariate analysis .
pensioners have a higher probability of undergoing a screening chest x - ray exam ( or 1.277 , 95 % ci 1.041 - 1.568 ) ; and trends for male gender ( or 1.188 , 95 % ci 1.013 - 1.393 ) , and professions at risk for lung diseases ( or 0.808 , 95 % ci 0.675 - 0.968 ) became statistically significant ( table 5 ) .
discussion screening tests are generally harmful and only in selected cases their benefit outweighs potential harms [ 22 ] .
in two systematic reviews of older randomized trials there was no evidence supporting the use of chest radiography for lung cancer screening [ 6,7 ] .
if anything , in these reviews screening with chest radiography was associated with increased lung cancer mortality [ 7 ] , although this finding is consistent with over - diagnosis bias , given that overall mortality was not affected .
health hazards are not related to radiation exposure , since the delivered dose is very low [ 23 ] ; they rather stem from the additional diagnostic and / or therapeutic interventions during further evaluation of false positive findings [ 6 ] .
indicatively , the proportion of abnormal chest x - ray findings ranges between 3 - 10 % [ 24,25 ] with a rate of false positive results ranging from 40 - 60 % [ 7 ] .
thus , the implementation of even a relatively inexpensive imaging study on a massive scale would greatly burden health economics and the workload of radiology departments .
despite the available evidence and recommendations , physicians throughout the world still prescribe chest radiography for screening purposes [ 8 - 16 ] .
little is known in peer - reviewed literature about how chest radiography is practiced for screening purposes among the general healthy adult population .
based on our review of the current literature , only three studies have been published since 1995 [ 16 - 18 ] , but all these studies present major limitations .
in the study of woodward ( 1996 ) the " perceptions of 452 canadian physicians about the extent to which patients in their practices obtained screening chest radiography at regular intervals " were investigated [ 17 ] .
in the study of hutchison ( 1998 ) the proportion of chest radiograms recommended by 62 canadian physicians during 246 unannounced " standard patients " was evaluated [ 18 ] .
however no data had been reported in these two studies about the real application of the test among the underlying populations .
in the third study ( 1995 ) , 3281 patients' charts were audited from medical archives of 60 physicians , and data were further abstracted for screening chest radiography practices [ 16 ] .
still in this case the information should be considered incomplete since we do not know anything about the proportion of patients who performed the test due to their own will ( opportunistic screening ) , or prescription by another physician .
this is therefore the first study indexing the impact of screening chest radiography habit among a population subgroup .
practice of chest radiograms for screening purposes was common among the examined sample of greek adults : 20 % underwent it for at least one time during the previous three years and among these , 48 % declared to perform it with a frequency equal or higher than once every three years .
interestingly , in logistic regression analyses the high - utilization rates were not strongly driven by smoking practice ( smokers versus no smokers ) , as previously hypothesized [ 26 ] .
moreover , people with professions at risk for lung disease also showed lower high - utilization trends .
individuals at major risk for over - screening chest radiograms were male subjects , pensioners and individuals with a family history positive for lung cancer .
the retrieved rates of screening chest radiography should not surprise .
in a recent greek survey of 211 physicians , 88 % declared to recommend chest radiography for early diagnosis procedures : 78 % prescribed it during usual check - up visit , and 77 % recommend it for cancer screening [ 15 ] .
high chest radiography prescription rates may still be explained by the absence of national guidelines and it might be guessed that the european code against cancer recommendations [ 1 ] do not have any impact on prescription practices .
ignorance of the formal recommendations on the issue might be an explanation , especially in countries without a strong tradition in primary care medicine .
some limitations should be discussed .
first , despite the fact that screening chest radiography is being studied from the sixties and onwards , this is the first study analyzing its practice among the general population .
since the greek primary care system based on specialized physicians is " newborn " , it might be precarious to generalize these findings globally .
second , we analyzed only patients that underwent chest radiography within three years .
this may under - estimate the proportion of individuals screened since many of them may have undergone screening chest radiograms in an antecedent date .
furthermore , data were derived from a cross - sectional study on a large convenience sample of the greek healthy adult population .
this design has limited internal validity and is sensitive to a variety of biases .
nevertheless , cross - sectional surveys are most commonly used , and are considered appropriate and easy to perform .
conclusion chest radiography practice for screening purposes is an old habit that dies hard .
more research should be conducted concerning the causes and possible remedies of this phenomenon .

background the link between host mhc ( major histocompatibility complex ) genotype and malaria is largely based on correlative data with little or no experimental control of potential confounding factors .
we used an experimental mouse model to test for main effects of mhc - haplotypes , mhc heterozygosity , and mhc x parasite clone interactions .
we experimentally infected mhc - congenic mice ( f2 segregants , homo - and heterozygotes , males and females ) with one of two clones of plasmodium chabaudi and recorded disease progression .
results we found that mhc haplotype and parasite clone each have a significant influence on the course of the disease , but there was no significant host genotype by parasite genotype interaction .
we found no evidence for overdominance nor any other sort of heterozygote advantage or disadvantage .
conclusion when tested under experimental conditions , variation in the mhc can significantly influence the course of malaria .
however , mhc heterozygote advantage through overdominance or dominance of resistance cannot be assumed in the case of single - strain infections .
future studies might focus on the interaction between mhc heterozygosity and multiple - clone infections .
background the link between the mhc ( major histocompatibility complex ) and malaria [ 1,2 ] is a widely cited example of a link between host genes and the course of a disease .
however , for humans , such links cannot be studied under controlled experimental conditions .
therefore , the significance of the mhc for disease severity is still not fully understood [ 3 - 12 ] .
the mouse model offers the possibility of studying potential mhc effects both under experimental conditions and in congenic strains , i.e. in strains that differ only in the mhc region but are identical on the rest of the genome [ 13 - 16 ] .
however , even when working with mhc congenic strains , potential confounding effects remain .
this include , firstly , host age which may influence pathogen susceptibility and should therefore not vary with mhc genotype .
secondly , maternal environmental effects are known to affect offspring size , number , and general vigour [ 17,18 ] .
such maternal effects could explain why some congenic strains produce different olfactory signals only in parental strains but not in f2 segregants [ 19 ] , or why congenic strains sometimes differ in behavior [ 20 ] .
lastly , mhc - congenic lines may differ with respect to the mutation load on their background genes , as there is at least one example of different mortalities during the first days of development before blastocyst formation ( as tested under controlled in vitro conditions in wedekind et al. [ 21 ]) .
as variation in age , maternal effects or mutation load could interact with pathogen susceptibilities [ 22 ] , studies which aim to isolate the effects of particular loci must use breeding designs that randomize all background effects [ 22 - 24 ] .
f2 segregants bred and reared under controlled conditions can account for such possibly confounding effects [ 22,25 - 27 ] .
we studied f2 segregants of mhc congenic strains during experimental exposure to two clones of plasmodium chabaudi ( such infections share many similarities to p. falciparum infections in humans [ 28,29 ]) .
we first addressed the following questions : ( i ) do mhc genotypes differ in their response to malaria when tested under experimental conditions ?
( ii ) is there a significant interaction between the mhc - haplotypes and the malaria clones on disease severity ?
( iii ) is there an mhc heterozygote advantage in our example of single - clone infections ?
these questions were previously addressed in mice with segregaring h - 2a and h - 2b haplotypes [ 30 ] .
h - 2a homozygotes turned out to be more susceptible to both malaria clones than h - 2b homozygotes , and h - 2ab heterozygotes did worse than expected from the average response of the homozygotes .
here , we tested additional mhc genotypes , h - 2k , h - 2ak , and h - 2bk , with the same methods and the same pathogen strains as in our previous study .
this expanded analysis allowed us to address some further questions : ( iv ) in general , are the previously observed separate and combined effects of host mhc , host gender , pathogen clone , and the time course of the disease symptoms repeatable when tested on other host genotypes ?
( v ) in particular , does the h - 2a haplotype again cause higher susceptibilties than the h - 2b haplotype if combined with another haplotype ( the h - 2k ) ?
( vi ) can we add two more examples of heterozygotes doing worse than expected from the average response of their respective homozygotes ?
results the separate and combined effects of mhc , host gender , and parasite clone we first concentrate on mhc effects in the two heterozygous genotypes .
the fully - factorial experimental design allowed study of the separate and combined impact of mhc type ( h - 2ak , h - 2bk ) , host gender ( two sexes ) , and parasite clone (" as " and " cw ") .
we tracked the time course of the disease in daily weight measurements , and in repeated parasitemia counts and blood cell counts .
the resulting repeated measures analyses of variances ( anovas ) are summarized in table 1 and discussed below .
variation in age was minimised by synchronized breeding and excluding one exceptionally young mouse from the analyses .
when the above anova model was run on age as dependent variable ( instead of any of the disease parameters ) , none of the factors are significantly linked to age , i.e. age did not significantly vary with mhc - type , gender , or pathogen clone .
body weights and blood cell densities at the day of exposure or one day later were also not significantly different between the experimental groups , except that , as expected [ 30,31 ] , males were initially heavier than females ( t = 11.2 , p < 0.0001 ) and had lower blood cell densities ( t = 3.4 , p = 0.002 ) .

for within - subject analyses we used the multivariate f - tests .
one h - 2ak male had to be euthanized at day 15 and could therefore only be included in the analysis on parasitemia .
p - values that were = 0.05 in analogous tests on other h - 2 genotypes [ 30 ] are marked in bold .
consistent with previous studies [ 30,32,33 ] , mean parasitemia rose dramatically during the first 10 days post infection ( p.i. ) , and minimal blood cell counts and body weights were reached on average at day 10 and 12 p.i. , respectively ( fig. 1 ) .
at that stage , the mice had lost on average of 4.7 % ( se = 1.0 ) of their initial body weight and 65.8 % ( se = 1.8 ) of their initial red blood cells .
all but two mice survived the acute phase of the infection and recovered as parasitemia declined over the next few days ( following uk home office regulations , one h - 2bk male was euthanized at day 12 p.i. and one h - 2ak male at day 15 p.i. ) .

the mean parasitemia ( log10 - transformed ) and the mean blood cell number (* 109 )/ ml blood for mhc genotypes h - 2ak ( open triangles ) and h - 2bk ( closed triangles ) , or pathogen clone as ( open diamonds ) and clone cw ( closed diamonds ) are given over the course of the disease .
black symbols and lines refer to the data collected in this study on h - 2ak and h - 2bk mice , the green symbols and hatched lines refer to previously published results on homozygous h - 2a and h - 2b mice for comparison ( fig. 1 in [ 30 ] .
see table 1 for statistics .
hosts' mhc genotype had a strong effect on overall parasitemia ( p = 0.002 , table 1 ) and the time course of parasitemia ( p = 0.016 ; see also figure 1a ) .
the mhc also tended to influence blood cell counts ( p = 0.057 ) but did not significantly affect body weight change ( p = 0.79 , table 1 ) .
the h - 2ak genotype was more susceptible than the h - 2bk type ( fig. 1a , b ) .
the two parasite clones mainly differed in the time course of their effects on hosts , with clone as having its peak parasitemia earlier than clone cw ( p = 0.003 for clone x time term , table 1 , fig. 1c ) .
this corresponds with a similar pattern in the time course of the blood cell counts ( p = 0.001 for clone x time , table 1 , fig. 1d ) and a corresponding change in host weight over time ( p = 0.003 for clone x time , table 1 ) .
the two sexes varied over time in their blood cell counts ( p = 0.008 , table 1 ) and body weight change ( p = 0.013 , table 1 ) , and they reacted differently to the parasite clones ( significant clone x gender , time x clone x gender , and mhc x clone x gender interactions , table 1 ). the two clones did not significantly differ in overall parasitemia , blood cell counts , or weight differences ( p always > 0.35 , table 1 ) .
moreover , there was no significant interaction between parasite clone and mhc genotype in any of the disease symptoms ( mhc x clone , table 1 ) .
comparing homozygotes to heterozygotes to the above data on h - 2ak and h - 2bk heterozygotes , we added data from h - 2k homozygotes , as well as data from our previous study on h - 2a , h - 2b , and h - 2ab mice [ 30 ] and thus offer an overall analysis that compares the effects of six different mhc genotypes , three of them homozygous and three heterozygous , in nested anovas for each gender .
these analyses confirm that the mhc has a significant effect on parasitemia and blood cell counts ( p = 0.009 and 0.003 , respectively , table 2 ) and on the time course of the parasitemia ( p = 0.018 , table 2 ) .
however , the effects could only be observed in males .
none of the mhc effects were statistically significant if tested in females only ( table 3 ) .

for within - subject analyses we used the multivariate f - tests or wilk 's lambda when a factor had more than two levels as in " mhc " .
the table combines our findings on the genotypes h - 2ak , h - 2bk , and h - 2kk with the data of wedekind et al .
[ 30 ] who used exactly the same methods on the host genotypes h - 2aa , h - 2bb , and h - 2ab .
this results in six mhc genotypes , three homozygous ones and three heterozygous ones .
the analyses are separated for males ( here ) and females ( table 3 ) because the group h - 2kk was not represented in all experimental cells ( a prerequisite for full - factorial analyses ) .

it appears that none of the three heterozygous genotypes has lower parasitemia than any of their respective two homozygotes , i.e. we find no evidence for overdominance with respect to average parasitemia .
wedekind et al .
[ 30 ] tested whether the heterozygous h - 2ab had higher parasitemia than what could be expected from the average of the respective homozygotes by first equalizing the sample size of the two homozygous variants before pooling them .
this was done by randomly reducing the larger group to the size of the smaller group .
the fully - factorial repeated measure anova with the fixed factors heterozygosity , gender , and parasite clone was then calculated , and the whole procedure repeated 10 times to calculate an average f and p value ( in wedekind et al .
[ 30 ] the heterozygous h - 2ab had higher parasitemia than expected from the average of the two homozygotes ) .
here we did the analogous analyses for h - 2ak , comparing them to what would be expected from the homozygous h - 2a and h - 2k , and for h - 2bk , comparing them to what would be expected from the homozygous h - 2b and h - 2k .
none of the 2 x 10 runs resulted in a significant difference ( h - 2ak : f1,18 always < 3.0 ; h - 2bk : f1,48 always < 2.4 ; p always > 0.10 ) , i.e. we did not find any significant heterozygote advantage or disadvantage when we tested the two heterozygotes h - 2ak and h - 2bk .
figure 2 the effects of six mhc genotypes on the average disease symptoms in males and females .
the figure combines previous results on h - 2aa , h - 2ab , and h - 2bb mice [ 30 ] with the new observations on h - 2bk , h - 2kk , and h - 2ak mice .
the results ( means +/ - 95 % confidence intervals ) are separated for male and female hosts and are the average per subject of 6 repeated parasitemia measurements from day 4 - 14 , 11 counts of blood cell number (* 109 )/ ml blood from day 1 - 22 , and 19 body weight measurements from day 4 - 22 given as difference to the weight at day 0 ( in g ) .
see tables 2 and 3 for statistics ( main effects of mhc - type ) .
discussion most studies on the link between the mhc and a disease are based on correlative data with no experimental control for possible confounding effects of , for example , background genetics or non - genetic effects [ 2,34 - 37 ] .
in the case of malaria , we know that the severity of the disease can be influenced by many genetic and non - genetic factors [ 1 - 12,35,38 ] .
to elucidate the effects of particular mhc genotypes , it is therefore necessary to control for confounding factors and study experimental infections in an animal model .
here , we used an experimental design that controls for these potentially confounding effects .
our design allowed to test the separate and combined effects of various host and pathogen factors on the course of malaria in mice .
we found that the mhc has a significant effect on the course of malaria .
the h - 2ak genotype was more susceptible than the h - 2bk type .
this finding is consistent with the previous observation that the homozygous h - 2a genotype confers greater susceptibility than the homozygous h - 2b when tested under the same conditions with f2s [ 30 ] and under less controlled conditions with the original congenic strains [ 13 ] .
the severity of a disease can be seen as the result of an interaction between hosts and their parasites and not just as an intrinsic characteristic of a particular parasite clone [ 29,39,40 ] .
the two parasite clones caused different disease patterns ( confirming previous reports of their clone - specific characteristics [ 30,41,42 ]) , but disease severity also depended on host characteristics : the two sexes react differently to the parasite clones ( see the significant clone x gender interactions in table 1 ) .
some of these interactions were significant in a previous study [ 30 ] , and are thus repeatable .
our gender - specific analyses suggested that mhc effects on the course of malaria may be stronger in males than in females ( tables 2 and 3 ) .
gender - specific virulence is common in vertebrates [ 43 ] and could potentially lead to more pronounced effects of host genes on pathogen susceptibility in the male sex [ 44,45 ] .
however , possible gender - specific effects of mhc - specific disease patterns could not be confirmed in analyses that included gender as a factor , neither in the present study ( table 1 ) nor in a previous one [ 30 ] , with the exception of a significant mhc x clone x gender effect on body weight change that was not expected [ 30 ] .
therefore , what appears to be a gender - specific mhc - link to malaria in tables 2 and 3 could well be the consequence of some empty cells of the fully - factorial experimental design ( that forced us to do gender - specific analyses ) , combined with gender - specific characteristics that are not linked to the mhc .
the peptide - binding motifs of mhc molecules bind only a small fraction of all peptides [ 46 ] , i.e. different mhc molecules can be expected to bind largely to non - overlapping sets of peptides .
this mhc specificity may well lead to significant parasite clone x mhc - genotype interactions and frequency - dependent selection [ 47 - 51 ] , but our data could not support this .
in particular , we found no significant interaction between parasite clone and mhc genotype for any of the disease symptoms in either the present study ( mhc x clone , table 1 ) or our previous one [ 30 ] .
we suggest three mutually non - exclusive explanations for this non - significant finding : ( i ) the two clones , although clearly different in some respects , may be similar at some of their mhc - presented peptides , such that , for a given parasite clone , disease severity is relatively stable across host mhc types .
( ii ) our statistical power may be too low to detect existing gene - for - gene interactions , and ( iii ) time - and / or condition - dependent protein expression may partly mask existing gene - for - gene interactions .
the latter possibility seems to be supported by a significant three - way interaction ( mhc x clone x gender on body weight change ) .
moreover , there was a non - significant tendency for blood cell counts to vary over time depending on the mhc x pathogen clone combination ( p = 0.051 , table 1 ) .
when fighting infection , mhc heterozygotes are often expected to be superior to both their respective homozygotes ( i.e. exhibit overdominance ) because they can present a wider range of antigens to t lymphocytes [ 52 ] .
however , single infection experiments do not support this hypothesis [ 53 ] .
in our study , too , mhc heterozygotes did not have significantly lower parasitemias than both the respective homozygotes .
we had previously found that the heterozygotes h - 2ab did even worse than expected from the average response of the two respective homozygotes [ 30 ] .
this finding could not be confirmed with the additional genotypes we studied here : heterozygotes performed neither better or worse than the homozygotes .
taken together , it appears that mhc heterozygosity has , on average , little or no effect on the course of malaria in single - strain infections .
conclusion we found that variation in the mhc can have a significant effect on the course of a plasmodium infection .
the h - 2a haplotype is more susceptible than the h - 2b haplotype , regardless of whether its combined with h - 2k haplotype or tested in homozygotes , i.e. the previous findings [ 30 ] seem to be robust and repeatable .
we could also confirm a significant effect of mhc - types on the course of parasitemia ( the time x mhc effect in table 1 ) .
nearly all of the previously observed differences between the two parasite clones [ 30,41 ] could also be confirmed on the new host genotypes used here .
we have now compared three different mhc heterozygotes and their component homozygotes and found no heterozygote advantage in experimentally controlled single - clone infections. by contrast , under " field conditions " , mhc heterozygotes may show slower disease progression and / or more rapid clearance of an infection than the average of homozygotes ( e.g. [ 36,37 ]) .
mhc heterozygotes were indeed found to be overrepresented in some human populations [ 54,55 ] , indicating a population - level advantage of heterozygosity that could , however , not be confirmed in other studies [ 56 ] , and that cannot , for itself , explain the high degree of polymorphism of the mhc [ 57 ] .
moreover , even if a possible heterozygote advantage is observed in population studies , it is often unclear whether the advantage is due to overdominance , to dominance of resistance , or is explained only by the specific allele frequencies in a host population [ 58 ] .
haplotype - specific or allele - specific measures are therefore necessary to explain the kind of heterozygote advantage that is observed [ 53,59,60 ] .
our combined single - strain analyses suggests that either ( i ) parasites like plasmodium sp. have specific characteristics ( e.g. a relatively large antigen repertoire ) that obscure any heterozygote advantages which would be expected in other kind of infections , ( ii ) heterozygote advantages are more frequent in multi - clone or multi - parasite infections than in single - clone infections , or ( iii ) heterozygote advantages are indeed less frequent than expected from previous studies , and the widely assumed and sometimes supported mhc - heterozygosity advantage in disease susceptibility is a rule with many exceptions .
recent studies on pathogens with a presumably smaller antigen repertoire ( theiler 's virus and salmonella ) confirm that mhc heterozygote advantage cannot generally be assumed in the case of single - clone infections ( penn et al. 2002 ; mcclelland et al. 2003 ) .
in the case of plasmodium , genetically variable infections are harder to clear and sometimes more virulent than single - clone infections [ 33,61 ] , and thus may lead to different host - parasite interactions .
future studies might therefore incorporate a wider range of parasite clones , or might focus on the effects of multi - species or multiple - clone infections where the diversity of parasite antigens confronting the mhc could potentially change this result .
methods mouse breeding and maintenance mice were housed in standard conditions at 21degreesc and on a 12:12 h light - dark cycle , with food provided ad libitum ( 41b , harlan , uk ) and 0.05 % para - aminobenzoic acid added to their drinking water .
we started with three mhc - congenic strains of mice ( the mhc type given in parantheses ) : c57bl / 10 ( h - 2b ) , b10.a ( h - 2a ) , and b10.br ( h - 2k ) obtained from b & k universal , uk. in order to control for potential differences in the background mutation load and for possible differences in maternal effects , we crossed these three strains , reared the heterozygous offspring , and crossed them to produce the f2 generation that were used for present the experiments .
infections and monitoring the two cloned p. chabaudi lines we used are denoted " as " and " cw " [ 62 ]. between isolation from the field and use in this experiment , the two lines had been blood passaged in c57bl / 6j ( h - 2b ) mice for 8 and 6 times , respectively .
these two clones were chosen for their relatively low growth rate and virulence compared to other clones [ 41 ] .
each mouse was infected i.p. to 105 parasites in 0.1 ml , prepared from donor mice by diluting blood in a calf - serum solution , i.e. 50 % heat - inactivated calf - serum , 50 % ringer 's solution ( 27 mm kcl , 27 mm cacl2 , 0.15 m nacl ) , 20 units heparin / ml of mouse blood .
the parasites were obtained from one donor mouse each 6 - 7 days p.i. infected with frozen aliquots of blood .
we infected the males first and the females three days later .
mean (+/ - s.e. ) age at infection was 47.5 ( se = 0.7 days ) .
all experimental treatments of mice were performed in accordance with the animal ( scientific procedures ) act ( 1986 ) administered by the home office of the u.k .
( licence no. 60 / 5640 ) .
the mice were weighed to the nearest 10 mg on the day of infection and daily from days 4 to 22 p.i. red blood cell densities were estimated by flow cytometry ( coulter electronics ) from a 1 : 40 000 dilution of a 2 mul sample of tail blood into isoton solution on day 1 p.i. , and every 2 days from day 4 to 22 p.i. thin blood smears were made from tail blood every 2 days from day 4 - 14 p.i. these smears were stained with giemsa .
parasitemia was determined as the average proportion of infected red blood cells .
therefore , the number of infected and uninfected red blood cells were determined in at least 10 randomly picked microscopic fields per blood smear ( overall average = 124 red blood cells per microscopic field ; only a quarter of the non - infected cells per field was counted if cell density was high ) .
parasitemia was determined from coded slides blindly with respect to genotype and experimental treatment .
one mouse did not show signs of infection ( no parasitemia ) and was therefore excluded from the analyses .
infection was confirmed in all other mice .
genotyping we used allelic variation at a microsatellite locus to determine the mhc genotype of each offspring produced in the crosses.total genomic dna was extracted ( amersham biosciences animal tissue extraction kit ) from tail samples that had been stored in 70 % ethanol .
using oligonucleotide primers developed by meagher and potts [ 63 ] we initially examined variation at three loci which were likely to be sufficiently close to the mhcd locus to permit discrimination of alleles .
these loci were identified as 24 , 34 and 148 [ 63 ] .
separately for each locus , dna fragments were amplified via the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) using fluorescently labelled primers .
thermal cycling conditions were 25 cycles of 94degreesc denaturing , 50degreesc annealing and 72degreesc extension with times of 30 seconds each .
a small quantity of each pcr reaction mixture was visualised on agarose gels to verify amplification .
allelic size variants were discriminated on an abi 377 slab gel sequencer and the accompanying program genescan 3.7 and genotyper 2.5 .
polymerase chain reactions successfully amplified ~ 120 to 150 bp dna products for each of the loci tested .
only locus 34 proved sufficiently variable to discriminate all three size variants ( alleles ) .
statistics the experiment was designed for a fully - factorial repeated measures analysis of variance ( anova ) , with the factors host mhc , host gender , and parasite clone , and with repeated measure of a dependent variable each , i.e. parasitemia , blood cell density and weight change .
unfortunately , as the genotyping was only done after the exposure to the pathogens , some of the pathogen clone by sex combinations turned out to contain no replicates for the homozygous h - 2k .
we therefore used only the heterozygous h - 2ak and h - 2bk mice for the full model that includes gender and clone effects .
the homozygous h - 2k mice could be included in gender - specific analyses , assuming that the pathogen clone x mhc interaction has no or negligible effects on disease symptoms ( as was found in [ 30 ]) .
all analyses were done with jmp 5.1 [ 64 ] .
as the sphericity tests were each significant for the within - subject analyses , we used the multivariate f - tests ( when factors had only two levels as in " gender " or " clone ") or wilk 's lambda ( when a factor had more than two levels as in " mhc ") .
abbreviations mhc = major histocompatibility complex pcr = polymerase chain reaction authors' contributions cw conceived the study , designed the experiment , participated in recording the disease symptoms and in the genotyping , did the statistical analyses , and wrote the first draft of the manuscript .
mw optimized the parasitemia determination and analysed all blood samples .
tjl carried out the molecular genetic analyses .
all authors helped drafting the manuscript and approved the final version .

the risk and clinical significance of cardiac iron overload due to chronic transfusion varies with the underlying disease .
cardiac iron overload shortens the life expectancy of patients with thalassemia , whereas its effect is unclear in those with myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) .
in patients with sickle cell anemia ( sca ) , iron does not seem to deposit quickly in the heart .
our primary objective was to assess through a multicentric study the prevalence of cardiac iron overload , defined as a cardiovascular magnetic resonance t2 *< 20 ms , in patients with thalassemia , sca , or mds .
patient inclusion criteria were an accurate record of erythrocyte concentrates ( ecs ) received , a transfusion history > 8 ecs in the past year , and age older than 6 years .
we included from 9 centers 20 patients with thalassemia , 41 with sca , and 25 with mds in 2012 - 2014 .
erythrocytapharesis did not consistently prevent iron overload in patients with sca .
cardiac iron overload was found in 3 ( 15 %) patients with thalassemia , none with sca , and 4 ( 16 %) with mds .
the liver iron content ( lic ) ranged from 10.4 to 15.2 mg / g dry weight , with no significant differences across groups ( p = 0.29 ) .
abnormal t2 * was not significantly associated with any of the measures of transfusion or chelation .
ferritin levels showed a strong association with lic .
non - transferrin - bound iron was high in the thalassemia and mds groups but low in the sca group ( p < 0.001 ) .
hepcidin was low in thalassemia , normal in sca , and markedly elevated in mds ( p < 0.001 ) .
two mechanisms may explain that iron deposition largely spares the heart in sca : the high level of erythropoiesis recycles the iron and the chronic inflammation retains iron within the macrophages .
thalassemia , in contrast , is characterized by inefficient erythropoiesis , unable to handle free iron .
iron accumulation varies widely in mds syndromes due to the competing influences of abnormal erythropoiesis , excess iron supply , and inflammation .

cardiac iron overload has also been reported in a minority of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) [ 2 - 4 ] .
iron overload has been associated with an increased risk of progression to leukemia and with shorter survival in non - chelated low - risk patients with mds [ 4 , 5 ] .
the heart does not seem to be an early target for iron accumulation in chronically transfused patients with sickle cell anemia ( sca ) [ 6 ] .
nevertheless , cardiac iron overload has been reported in a small percentage of chronically transfused young adults with sca [ 7 ] .
hypotheses put forward to explain that the heart is relatively spared in sca include a later onset of chronic transfusion compared to thalassemia , the use of erythrocytapheresis rather than simple transfusion , chronic inflammation that sequesters iron within reticuloendothelial cells , and efficient erythropoiesis capable of handling the iron from both transfused blood and hemolysis [ 6 - 10 ] .
blood transfusion is increasingly used in patients with mds or sca [ 11 ] , who nevertheless are not routinely screened for iron overload and receive less iron chelation compared to patients with thalassemia [ 12 ] .
these patients may , therefore , be at risk for iron - related comorbidities .
the primary objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of cardiac iron overload , defined as a cardiovascular magnetic resonance t2 * < 20 ms , in patients with thalassemia , sca , or mds .
we also sought to identify factors associated with cardiac iron overload .
patients and methods the study was approved by the appropriate ethics committee ( comite de protection des personnes d'ile de france 2 ) (# 21 / 21 / 2010 ) and supported by the ap - hp department for clinical research and development ( drcd ) , paris , france .
written informed consent was approved by the ethics committee ; it was obtained from each patient and / or both parents before study inclusion .
patients inclusion criteria were availability of a complete blood transfusion record , history of receiving at least 8 erythrocyte concentrates ( ecs ) in the past year , age older than 6 years to allow magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) without sedation , and affiliation to an health insurance system .
patients with heart diseases due to causes other than iron overload were not included .
the patients were included between march 14 , 2012 , and february 21 , 2014 , at nine centers in france .
data collection iron accumulation in the heart and liver was assessed using mri .
myocardial t2 * ( ms ) and liver iron content ( lic ) ( mg of iron / g dry weight ) were recorded .
within 6 months before or after mri , blood was drawn for serum assays of iron , ferritin , non - transferrin - bound iron ( ntbi ) , and hepcidin .
ntbi was measured using the ferostm elpi kit and hepcidin by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry .
in patients treated with deferasirox , the drug was assayed in plasma using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry , as previously described [ 13 ] .
the following data were collected retrospectively from the medical files of each patient : diagnosis , age at study inclusion , ethnic origin , history of splenectomy , serological status for hepatitis b and c ( hcv ) , age at first transfusion , number of ecs transfused since the diagnosis , number of ecs transfused each year , time since initiation of chronic transfusion , transfusion procedure ( simple transfusion , manual exchange transfusion , or erythrocytapheresis ) , age and ferritin levels at the beginning of chelation , and type of chelation .
given the scarcity of published data on risk factors for cardiac iron overload in chronically transfused patients , we had no point of reference for estimating the sample size .
we estimated that including 50 patients in each diagnostic group would allow us to identify associations linking selected parameters to cardiac iron overload .
imaging data all patients underwent prospectively cardiac t2 * by the same mri method according to anderson et al [ 14 ] , liver iron content ( lic ) according to the mri method of gandon et al [ 15 ] , with 1.5 tesla machine and were validated in routine practice , evidencing the comparability of the measurements in the different centers [ 16 ] .
statistical tests statistical analyses were performed using r software version 2.11.1 .
descriptive statistics were computed for each diagnostic group .
continuous variables were described as mean +/ - sd if normally distributed and as median [ min - max ] otherwise .
categorical variables were described as n (%) .
we used the chi - square test or fisher 's exact test , as appropriate , to test for associations between categorical variables .
to compare distributions of continuous outcomes across groups , anova or the nonparametric kruskal - wallis test ( when distribution was not normal ) was performed .
when the results indicated a significant overall difference , the t test or wilcoxon test was applied to each pair of groups , and corresponding p values were adjusted using the benjamini - hochberg method to take the multiple comparisons into account .
spearman 's rho and p value of its corresponding test were calculated to investigate correlations between continuous parameters .
all tests were two - sided .
p values <= 0.05 were considered significant .
results descriptive data one hundred and four patients were included in this study .
eighteen of them were excluded from our analysis ( n = 2 did not meet inclusion criteria ( total number of ecs received unavailable ) , n = 16 did not undergo cardiac t2 * mri or its result could not be collected ) .
thus , 86 patients were analyzed : 20 with thalassemia , 41 with sca , and 25 with mds ( table 1 ) .
as expected , the patients with mds were older than were the patients with thalassemia or sca , and most of them ( 96 %) were of european descent .
in the thalassemia group , 70 % of patients had a history of splenectomy , a significantly higher proportion than in the other groups ( p < 0.001 ) .
the 12 % prevalence of positive hcv serology in the sca group may be ascribable to the history of episodic blood transfusions in some sca patients during their infancy in africa .

we divided the patients with sca into two groups depending on whether their transfusion procedure at the time of the study was erythrocytapheresis ( n = 11 , e - sca group ) or another method ( n = 30 , including 29 given manual exchange transfusions and 1 simple transfusions , non - e - sca group ) .
the 25 patients with mds were distributed as follows according to the who classification : refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts ( rars ) , n = 12 ; refractory anemia ( ra ) , n = 6 ; unclassified , n = 2 ; refractory anemia with excess of blasts ( raeb - 1 ) , n = 2 ; 5q minus syndrome , n = 1 ; and myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative disease , n = 2 .
according to the international prognostic scoring system ( ipss ) [ 17 ] , they were all low risk : low risk in 15 cases and intermediate 1 in 10 cases .
table 2 describes the main transfusion and chelation characteristics .
since mds affects older patients , their age at transfusion initiation was significantly older , and their time on chronic transfusion and total number of ecs received since the diagnosis were significantly lower ( p < 0.01 ) .
when we compared the number of ecs given per year across groups , we found that the only significant difference was a higher number / year in the e - sca group compared to the non - e - sca group ( 35 / y vs 21 / y , p = 0.03 ) .

chelation was given to 95 % of patients in the thalassemia group and 90 % of those in the non - e - sca group , compared to only 72 % of patients in the e - sca group and 72.7 % of those in the mds group .
age at chelation initiation was older in the e - sca group than in the non - e - sca group ( 18 vs. 9 years ) ; the serum ferritin level at chelation initiation was apparently lower in the e - sca group ( 1500 ng / ml vs. 2075 ng / ml in the non - e - sca group ) , but this variable was missing for nearly half the patients and , therefore , statistical testing was not performed ) .
data on chelation were available for 72 of the 86 patients .
they are reported in table 3 .
seven patients received no chelation. of the remaining 65 patients , 55 received deferasirox ( 14 / 20 with thalassemia , 25 / 41 with sca , and 16 / 25 with mds ) , 9 deferiprone ( 3 / 20 with thalassemia and 6 / 41 with sca ) , and 1 deferoxamine .
in each diagnostic group , about half the patients given deferasirox had at least one plasma deferasirox assay .

cardiac iron overload defined as t2 *< 20 ms was diagnosed in 3 ( 15 %) patients with thalassemia and 4 ( 16 %) patients with mds .
no patient with sca had t2 *< 20 ms , despite non - significantly higher serum ferritin levels ( p = 0.08 ) in the two sca groups .
ferritin levels were strongly associated with lic both in the overall population and in each group ( fig 1 ) .
serum iron was elevated in the thalassemia and mds groups but normal in the sca groups , producing a highly significant difference ( p < 0.001 ) .
ntbi was also high in the thalassemia and mds groups and considerably lower in the sca groups ( p < 0.001 ) .
the largest differences across groups were for the serum hepcidin levels , which were low in the patients with thalassemia , normal in those with sca , and markedly elevated in those with mds ( p < 0.001 ) .
ntbi was significantly associated with serum iron ( rho = 0.46 , p < 0.001 ) , but with none of the others parameters studied ( ferritin , lic , years of transfusion therapy , hepcidin level ) .
on the whole population , hepcidin level was significantly associated with ferritin ( rho = 0.55 , p < 0.01 ) , lic ( rho = 0.35 , p < 0.01 ) , and with years of transfusion therapy ( rho = - 0.31 , p < 0.01 ) .
the association between hepcidin level and ferritin was the only one that remained strong and significant in most of the disease groups ( it was non significant for mds ) ( fig 2 ) .

factors associated with cardiac iron overload none of the patients with sca had cardiac iron overload .
lic elevation was associated with cardiac iron overload in the patients with thalassemia ( p = 0.04 ) or mds ( p = 0.03 ) .
surprisingly , cardiac iron overload was not significantly associated with any of the transfusion or chelation parameters , but our study is limited by the short number of patients developing cardiac iron .
discussion over 300 000 children are born each year with major thalassemia or sca .
cardiac iron overload is the leading cause of death in thalassemia .
in the uk , routine mri t2 * monitoring and improved iron chelation have been associated with a 71 % decrease in deaths due to thalassemia [ 18 ] .
the relationship between excess iron and mortality in sca is more difficult to analyze , because the patients with transfusion - related iron overload are also those who have greater disease severity requiring chronic transfusion [ 19 , 20 ] .
however , although additional long - term prospective studies are still needed [ 21 ] , blood transfusion is increasingly used in patients with sca , particularly for primary and secondary stroke prevention [ 22 ] .
as a result , iron - related toxicity has been reported in sca [ 7 , 23 ] .
clearly , there is a pressing need for evaluating the potential consequences of transfusion iron overload in sca .
finally , there is increasing evidence that iron chelation benefits patients with mds [ 2 - 5 ] , not only by diminishing the deposition of iron in the liver and heart , but also by alleviating the adverse effects of iron on erythroid precursors [ 3 , 24 ] .
in thalassemia , both the liver and the heart contain excess iron , whereas in sca the iron deposits selectively in the liver .
in a study of 141 patients with sca who died in adulthood , at a mean age of 36 +/ - 11 years , darbari et al found that 16 ( 11.4 %) had cirrhosis and 10 ( 7.1 %) iron overload ; seven of 16 ( 43.8 %) patients with cirrhosis had iron overload compared with 3 of the 125 without cirrhosis ( 2.4 %) ( p < 0.001 ) [ 23 ] .
the heart seems less affected by iron overload in children and young patients [ 25 - 27 ] , although iron - related cardiomyopathy has been reported in older patients .
thus , in a series of 201 chronically transfused patients with sca , 6 had cardiac iron overload , including 1 aged 17 years and 5 aged 22 to 29.6 years [ 7 ] .
we found no cardiac iron overload in our 41 patients with sca , whose median age was 22.9 +/ - 13.5 years , whereas lic values in the sca groups were similar to those in the thalassemia and mds groups .
these results confirm that , in patients with sca , iron overload selectively targets the liver , leaving initially the heart relatively spared .
our finding of severe iron overload with lic elevation in patients with sca managed using erythrocytapheresis contrasts with previous reports [ 10 , 28 , 29 ] .
several factors may explain this discrepancy .
first , duration of transfusion was longer in our patients than in previous studies .
given the severity of the anemia in the sca patients included in this study , the centers programmed each automated erythrocytapheresis procedure to increase the hemoglobin level by 1.5 g / dl compared to the pre - procedure value , which can induce substantial accumulation of iron over several years .
second , adherence to chelator therapy seemed low in the e - sca group : of the 5 patients with plasma deferasirox assays , 3 had low values .
physicians may direct insufficient attention to adherence because of a misconception that erythrocytapheresis prevents totally iron overload .
efforts are needed to raise physician awareness about the risk of iron overload despite erythrocytapheresis .
the 16 % prevalence of cardiac iron overload in the mds group is consistent with earlier data from chronically transfused patients with mds ( 18 % [ 30 ] and 16 % [ 31 ]) .
cardiac iron overload may contribute to heart failure in this older population , in addition to chronic anemia and comorbidities .
liver iron overload has been reported to antedate cardiac iron overload in patients with thalassemia or mds [ 32 , 33 ] .
cardiac iron overload usually develops only after severe hepatic iron overload but not exclusively , since some patients may accumulate iron in heart whereas they have a negative liver iron balance [ 33 ] .
in spite of the low frequency of cardiac iron overload in our cohort , resulting in a lack of power to detect associations , we found a significant relationship between increased lic and abnormal t2 * in patients with thalassemia ( p = 0.04 ) and mds ( p = 0.03 ) .
some other studies found poor correlation , this discrepancy might be be explained by differences in the kinetics of iron uptake and in iron elimination in the heart and the liver [ 33 ] .
cardiac iron overload as defined by t2 *< 20 ms was absent in sca but present in some patients with thalassemia or mds despite similar total numbers of ecs received .
the reasons for this finding are unclear .
the efficiency of erythropoiesis may play a key role in determining the rate and location of iron deposition .
in diseases characterized by inefficient erythropoiesis , whether inherited such as thalassemia or acquired such as mds , hepcidin production is suppressed and iron absorption increased [ 34 , 35 ] .
thus , our patients with thalassemia had low hepcidin levels , high serum iron and ntbi , and more organ damages , since iron under ntbi form enters the myocytes through the voltage - dependent l - type calcium channels and induces the development of a cardiomyopathy [ 36 ] .
hepcidin levels were normal in sca patients , whose low ntbi levels resulted probably from massive consummation of iron through effective erythropoiesis , making ntbi less available in the circulation .
a recent study compared 5 patients with thalassaemia , 5 with sca , and 5 with diamond - blackfan anemia [ 37 ] .
the three groups were comparable for age , time on chronic transfusion , and time on chelation .
ntbi levels were lowest in the sca group , suggesting better iron utilization .
further support for this explanation comes from a study of iron overload in 121 chronically transfused children with sca enrolled in the twitch trial [ 38 ] .
interestingly , despite a mean time on chronic transfusion of 4.1 +/ - 2.4 years , mean transferrin saturation was 47.2 %+/ - 23.6 % , i.e. , lower than the value expected after a comparable transfusion time in patients with thalassemia .
we did not collect transferrin saturation data .
however , serum iron reliably mirrors transferrin saturation in patients without hypotransferrinemia .
in our study , serum iron was normal in the patients with sca .
conceivably , in sca , the large amounts of heme - bound iron from transfused blood and hemolysis may be efficiently handled by the liver macrophages , transferred to the bone marrow , and used to produce erythrocytes , thereby preventing the formation of ntbi .
furthermore , chronic inflammation , which increases hepcidin levels , is a prominent feature of sca that limits the release of iron release from macrophages [ 39 ] .
a recent study of adults with sca showed that the percentage of reticulocytes and levels of erythropoietin , ferritin , and c - reactive protein contributed to variations in hepcidin levels [ 40 ] .
hepcidin levels were very high in our patients with mds .
in previously published works , hepcidin levels varied across mds subtypes [ 3 ] , due to the conflicting influences of dyserythropoiesis , transfusion - related iron overload , and inflammation [ 41 ] .
our patients with mds were heavily transfused and had high hepcidin levels , without major inflammation ( median c - reactive protein , 5.0 mg / l [ range , 0 - 42 ]) , suggesting that iron overload in this population increased the production of hepcidin , albeit not sufficiently to prevent high transfusion - related ntbi release .
in conclusion , in sca , the liver is the main target for iron accumulation , and the heart is usually initially spared , perhaps because iron is recycled by efficient erythropoiesis and trapped within macrophages due to chronic inflammation .
iron overload can occur in sca even when erythrocytapheresis is used .
in thalassemia , erythropoiesis is inefficient , allowing free iron to deposit within tissues .
in mds , the heterogeneity of the causative diseases and competing influences of abnormal erythropoiesis , iron overload , and inflammation produce widely variable results .
we are indebted to caroline tourte and valerie jolaine ( paris descartes clinical research unit , necker children 's hospital ) for their careful collection and organization of the data in the centers ; to professor pierre brissot for fruitful discussions , and to a. wolfe md for help in preparing the manuscript .

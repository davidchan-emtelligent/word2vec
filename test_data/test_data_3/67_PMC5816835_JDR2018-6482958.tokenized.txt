a recent report suggested that brain - derived serotonin ( 5 - ht ) is critical for maintaining weight loss induced by glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor activation in rats and that 5 - ht2a receptors mediate the feeding suppression and weight loss induced by glp - 1 receptor activation .
here , we show that changes in daily food intake and body weight induced by intraperitoneal administration of liraglutide , a glp - 1 receptor agonist , over 4 days did not differ between mice treated with the tryptophan hydroxylase ( tph ) inhibitor p - chlorophenylalanine ( pcpa ) for 3 days and mice without pcpa treatment .
treatment with pcpa did not affect hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptor expression .
despite the anorexic effect of liraglutide disappearing after the first day of treatment , the body weight loss induced by liraglutide persisted for 4 days in mice treated with or without pcpa .
intraperitoneal administration of liraglutide significantly decreased the gene expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors 1 h after injection .
moreover , the acute anorexic effects of liraglutide were blunted in mice treated with the high - affinity 5 - ht2a agonist ( 4 - bromo - 3,6 - dimethoxybenzocyclobuten - 1 - yl ) methylamine hydrobromide 14 h or 24 h before liraglutide injection .
these findings suggest that liraglutide reduces appetite and body weight independently of 5 - ht synthesis in mice , whereas glp - 1 receptor activation downregulates the gene expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors .
1. introduction central serotonin ( 5 - ht ) systems have a critical role in the regulation of appetite and body weight .
central serotonin 5 - ht2c receptors contribute to the leptin - independent regulation of appetite [ 1 ] .
liraglutide , a glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor agonist used clinically to treat type 2 diabetes and / or obesity , induces feeding suppression in mice 1 h after administration [ 2 ] .
we previously reported that the acute anorexic effects of liraglutide in mice do not require central 5 - ht and functional leptin receptor signaling [ 2 ] .
a recent report by anderberg et al. , however , suggested that brain - derived 5 - ht is critical for maintaining weight loss induced by glp - 1 receptor activation and pharmacologic blockade of central serotonin 5 - ht2a receptors using r - 96544 attenuates the chronic anorexic and weight loss effects of central injection of exedin - 4 ( ex4 ) or intraperitoneal injection of liraglutide in rats [ 3 ] .
therefore , in the present study , to determine whether 5 - ht is critical for the weight loss induced by glp - 1 receptor activation in mice , we examined the effects of liraglutide on daily food intake and body weight over 4 days in mice treated with or without the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p - chlorophenylalanine ( pcpa ) for 3 days .
in addition , to evaluate the relationship between the acute anorexic effects of the glp - 1 receptor agonist and the expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors , we examined the effect of liraglutide on the expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a and 5 - ht2c receptors in mice , which are responsive to the administration of liraglutide .
we further assessed whether 5 - ht2a receptors are involved in the acute anorexic effects of liraglutide by examining the acute effects of liraglutide on food intake in mice pretreated with the high - affinity 5 - ht2a agonist ( 4 - bromo - 3,6 - dimethoxybenzocyclobuten - 1 - yl ) methylamine hydrobromide ( tcb - 2 ) .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
general procedures male c57bl6j mice were purchased from japan clea .
the mice were individually housed in cages with free access to water and chow pellets in a light - and temperature - controlled environment ( 12 h on / 12 h off , lights on at 08 : 00 ; 20 - 22degreesc ) .
in exp 1 , 6 - week - old c57bl6j mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 % tween saline or pcpa ( 500 mg / kg ) once a day over 3 days as described previously [ 2 ] .
daily body weight changes were determined .
in the fourth day , the animals were decapitated and the hypothalamus was removed for rna extraction , as described previously [ 2 , 4 ] .
in exp 2 , 6 - week - old c57bl6j mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 % tween saline or pcpa ( 500 mg / kg ) once a day over 3 days .
then , mice were intraperitoneally injected with saline or liraglutide ( 100 mug / kg ) in the light cycle once a day over 4 days .
daily food intake and body weight changes were determined .
in exp 3 , 6 - week - old c57bl6j mice were intraperitoneally injected with saline or liraglutide ( 100 mug / kg ) in the light cycle .
one hour later , the animals were decapitated ; animals were not fed .
the hypothalamus was removed for rna extraction , as described previously [ 2 , 4 ] .
in exp 4 , 6 - week - old c57bl6j mice were intraperitoneally injected with saline or the high - affinity 5 - ht2a agonist , 4 - bromo - 3,6 - dimethoxybenzocyclobuten - 1 - yl methylamine hydrobromide ( tcb - 2 ) ( 2.5 mg / kg ) in the light cycle .
14 h later and 24 h later , mice were intraperitoneally injected with saline or liraglutide ( 100 mug / kg ) in the light cycle , respectively .
chow pellets were provided 30 min later .
the intake of chow pellets was measured for the next 1 h and then 2 h. the dose of pcpa ( 500 mg / kg ) was selected based on evidence that pcpa remarkably decreases brain and serum 5 - ht levels in mice [ 5 , 6 ] .
the dose of liraglutide ( 100 mug / kg ) was selected based on evidence that liraglutide acutely induced hypophagia in mice [ 2 , 7 ] .
the dose of tcb - 2 ( 2.5 mg / kg ) was selected based on evidence that tcb - 2 had no significant effect on food intake [ 8 ] .
liraglutide was a kind gift from novo nordisk , japan .
sarpogrelate hydrochloride was supplied by mitsubishi pharma ( osaka , japan ) .
tcb - 2 was purchased from tocris bioscience ( ellisville , mo , usa ) .
liraglutide was dissolved in 0.2 ml 0.9 % saline .
the pcpa was suspended in 0.2 ml 1 % tween saline .
the experiment was performed between 9 : 00 and 12 : 00 .
the animal studies were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal experiments at the tohoku university graduate school of medicine .
2.2 .
real - time quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) total rna was isolated from mouse hypothalamus using the rneasy midi kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
cdna synthesis was performed using a super script iii first - strand synthesis system for rt - pcr kit ( invitrogen , rockville , md ) with 1 mug total rna .
cdna synthesized from total rna was evaluated in a real - time pcr quantitative system ( lightcycler nano instrument roche diagnostics , mannheim , germany ) .
the primers used were listed in table 1 .
the relative amount of mrna was calculated using beta - actin mrna as the invariant control .
data are shown as fold change of the mean value of the control group , which received saline as described previously [ 2 , 4 ] .
2.2.1 .
statistical methods data are presented as mean +/ - sem ( n = 6 ) .
comparisons between the two groups were performed using student 's t - test .
comparisons among more than two groups were performed using analysis of variance with bonferroni 's correction for multiple comparisons .
a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
3. results 3.1 .
effects of pcpa for 3 days on food intake , body weight changes , and expression of hypothalamic tph2 and 5 - ht2ar in mice following treatment with or without pcpa for 3 days treatment with pcpa ( 500 mg / kg ) for 3 days significantly decreased body weight gain ( figure 1 ( a )) compared with controls .
treatment with pcpa for 3 days remarkably decreased expression of hypothalamic tph2 compared with controls ( 25 %) but did not affect the expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors in mice ( figure 1 ( b )) .
these findings demonstrate that despite the inhibition of tph2 , the treatment with pcpa does not affect expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors in mice .
3.2 .
effects of liraglutide on daily food intake and body weight changes in mice following treatment with or without pcpa for 3 days changes in daily food intake ( figure 2 ( a )) and body weight ( figure 2 ( b )) induced by intraperitoneal administration of saline over 4 days did not differ between mice treated with the pcpa ( 500 mg / kg ) for 3 days and mice without pcpa treatment .
intraperitoneal administration of liraglutide ( 100 mug / kg ) in mice significantly decreased food intake on the first day of treatment and decreased body weight over 4 days compared with saline controls in mice treated with or without pcpa for 3 days .
changes in daily food intake ( figure 2 ( c )) and body weight ( figure 2 ( d )) induced by intraperitoneal administration of liraglutide ( 100 mug / kg ) over 4 days did not differ between mice treated with the pcpa ( 500 mg / kg ) for 3 days and mice without pcpa treatment .
these findings demonstrate that 5 - ht is not required for feeding suppression and body weight loss induced by liraglutide in mice .
3.3 .
effect of liraglutide on expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors and 5 - ht2c receptors in mice intraperitoneal injection of liraglutide ( 100 mug / kg ) significantly decreased the expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors compared with saline controls but did not affect the expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2c receptors 1 h after injection ( figure 3 ) .
these findings demonstrate that glp - 1 receptors downregulate expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors in mice .
3.4 .
effect of pretreatment with tcb - 2 on the acute anorexic effect of liraglutide in mice although intraperitoneal injection of liraglutide ( 100 mug / kg ) significantly suppressed food intake compared with saline controls for 2 h after injection , the acute anorexic effects of liraglutide were blunted in mice , which were pretreated with tcb - 2 ( figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b )) .
these findings demonstrate that pretreatment with a 5 - ht2a agonist partially reverses the acute anorexic effect of liraglutide in mice .
4. discussion the present study demonstrated that pcpa treatment ( 500 mg / kg ) for 3 days induces body weight loss in mice .
these findings support a previous report by other investigators that treatment with pcpa ( 300 mg / kg ) suppresses weight gain by increasing energy expenditure [ 9 ] .
although tph1 - deficient mice fed a normal diet have no significant effect on body weight , tph1 - deficient mice fed a high - fat diet are protected from obesity and insulin resistance by promoting brown adipose tissue - mediated thermogenesis [ 10 ] .
on the other hand , tph2 - deficient mice fed a normal diet decrease food intake and body weight [ 11 ] .
because pcpa inhibits tph1 and tph2 , both mechanisms could contribute to weight loss .
although liraglutide reportedly increases brain 5 - ht levels in rats [ 3 ] and both liraglutide and serotonergic receptor agonists , like lorcaserin , reduced body weight and food intake in rats , the increase in brain 5 - ht levels does not always induce reductions of food intake and body weight , especially in mice .
despite increased brain 5 - ht levels , ob / ob mice display hyperphagia and obesity [ 12 ] .
the genetic inhibition of 5 - ht synthesis in the brainstem decreases food intake and body weight in ob / ob mice and the wild - type mice [ 12 ] .
in addition , the pharmacologic inhibition of 5 - ht synthesis in the brainstem induced by treatment with a high dose pcpa ( 500 mg / kg ) or trans - 2 pcpa decreases body weight and food intake in c57bl6j mice , db / db mice [ 2 ] , and high - fat diet - induced obesity [ 13 ] .
thus , the decrease in central 5 - ht leads to the decrease in body weight and food intake in mice .
we previously reported that the pharmacologic inhibition of 5 - ht synthesis does not affect the acute anorexic effects of liraglutide in mice [ 2 ] .
the results of the present study further demonstrated that the pharmacologic inhibition of 5 - ht synthesis did not affect the feeding suppression induced by liraglutide for 24 h after injection in mice .
moreover , the inhibition of 5 - ht synthesis did not affect both the acute weight loss and maintenance of weight loss induced by liraglutide in mice .
thus , the feeding suppression and weight loss induced by liraglutide could be independent of 5 - ht synthesis in mice .
in addition , we demonstrated that liraglutide acutely decreased the gene expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors in mice , which are responsive to the acute anorexic effects of liraglutide .
despite the chemical inhibition of 5 - ht synthesis , the gene expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors was not changed .
thus , changes in brain 5 - ht synthesis and the gene expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors could be independent , and the decrease in hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptor gene expression induced by liraglutide is unlikely to be compensatory to an increased brain 5 - ht levels , although protein levels of the receptor were not measured here and could represent another regulatory mechanism .
moreover , pretreatment with a 5 - ht2a agonist reduced the acute anorexic effects of liraglutide .
we previously reported that intraperitoneal injection of sarpogrelate hydrochloride , a blood - brain barrier - penetrating selective 5 - ht2a receptor antagonist , acutely suppresses food intake and chronic administration of sarpogrelate hydrochloride decreases daily food intake and body weight in mice [ 14 ] .
these results suggest that glp - 1 receptors downregulate the expression of 5 - ht2a receptors in the hypothalamus and decreased hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptor signaling might be involved in the acute anorexic effects of glp - 1 receptor agonists independently of brain 5 - ht. we cannot rule out that pretreatment with a 5 - ht2a agonist might temporarily reduce the downstream signal of a 5 - ht2a pathway ; thus , the particular timing employed here has a potential to work as an antagonizing treatment to the 5 - ht2a signaling pathway .
because the pretreatment might reduce the amount of functional 5 - ht2a receptors at the downstream signaling , liraglutide might not be able to induce a full anorexic effect .
in addition , the similar effects of 5 - ht2a receptor agonist and antagonist on food intake [ 14 - 16 ] might be due to the paradoxical phenomenon that both agonism and antagonism of 5 - ht2a receptors induce 5 - ht2a receptor 's desensitization or downregulation [ 17 ] .
these results are in complete contrast to recently reported findings by anderberg et al. that brainstem - derived 5 - ht is critical for maintaining the weight loss induced by glp - 1 receptor activation and that central blockade of 5 - ht2a receptors attenuates the weight loss and anorexic effects of glp - 1 receptor agonists in rats [ 3 ] .
although the dose of pcpa ( 500 mg / kg ) that we used was higher than that ( 100 mg / kg ) used in their study , the pcpa treatment methods were the same between their study and ours [ 3 ] .
the different results might be due to species - specific differences between rats and mice or the paradoxical phenomenon of 5 - ht2a receptor agonists and antagonists [ 17 ] .
interestingly , effect of liraglutide on food intake in mice is only eliciting an anorexic effect on the first day of treatment .
this is not the case for rats , which show a multiday anorexic response that is the primary driver of the weight loss [ 3 ] .
despite the anorexic effect of liraglutide disappearing after the first day of treatment in mice , the body weight loss induced by liraglutide persisted for 4 days .
these findings suggest that increased energy expenditure is involved in maintaining weight loss induced by liraglutide in mice .
liraglutide reportedly stimulates the central nervous system - mediated brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and adipocyte browning independent of food intake in mice [ 18 ] .
because this profile and potential mechanisms of weight loss induced by liraglutide are different between rats in the anderberg study [ 3 ] and mice in the present study , it is not at all surprising that different brain factors are engaged by liraglutide in these two species .
in addition , the effect of 5 - ht2a agonist on feeding seems to be opposite between mice and rats , at least by comparing the studies .
moreover , our study demonstrated that liraglutide acutely decreased the expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors and food intake in mice .
5. conclusions these findings suggest that liraglutide reduces appetite and body weight independently of 5 - ht synthesis and that glp - 1 receptors downregulate the expression of hypothalamic 5 - ht2a receptors in mice .
pretreatment with a 5 - ht2a agonist might suppress the acute anorexic effects of liraglutide in mice .

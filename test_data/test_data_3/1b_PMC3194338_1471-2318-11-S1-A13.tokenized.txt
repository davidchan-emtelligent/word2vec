more and more elderly subjects carry out various activities , however because of physical frailty , activity exposes them to the risk of injuries and accidents .
they are more susceptible to traumatic injuries of road traffic accidents .
our objective was to analyze how increased age and the presence of several related diseases have contributed to an increase in the incidence of multiple trauma in the last 3 years .
materials and methods in the period january 2007 - october 2010 , in our uoc mcau with ob , adequately equipped for major trauma with a trauma area and red area with two shock rooms , 126304 total referrals were recorded .
the percentage of geriatric patients (>= 65 years ) was 25.73 % ( n = 32501 ) , amongst these 3067 ( 2.42 % of total referrals ) had medium - severe injuries from domestic or road traffic accidents ( fig.1 ) .
figure 1 injuried patients recorded in our emergency department from 2007 to 2010 results we observed that the incidence of geriatric trauma has remained constant every year , with a majority of females over males ( f / 1981 - m / 1086 ) ( fig.2 ) and that the age group most affected is between 75 and 84 years .
the 3067 patients we observed : head trauma was present in 1297 patients ( 42.3 %) , head and / or facial trauma 293 ( 9.6 %) , followed by thoracic trauma 242 ( 7.9 %) and / or abdominal trauma 37 ( 1.2 %) , often associated with single or multiple fractures ( fig.3 ) .
figure 2 figure 3 the most recurrent fracture was the fracture of the femur 513 ( 16.72 %) , especially in women ( possibly secondary to osteoporosis ) .
also numerous were fractures of the upper limbs ( n = 474 ) and rib fractures ( n = 333 ) .
in 40 % of cases ( 1227 ) the trauma was related to a syncope event .
1981 patients required hospitalization , predominantly in orthopaedics and traumatology ( n = 582 ) , in neurological wards ( n = 170 ) , in thoracic surgery ( n = 107 ) and 235 in other departments .
in the emergency department ( uoc mcau with ob ) , no death for geriatric trauma was observed .
conclusions the most frequent traumatic event is represented by falls , often associated with syncopal events , very frequent syndrome in geriatrics .
in road traffic trauma , the geriatric patient is more often a pedestrian , therefore , the risk of back injuries and fractures is significantly higher , and the risk of permanent disability or death is high .

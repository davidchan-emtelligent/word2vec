gsk256066 is a selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor that can be given by inhalation , minimising the potential for side effects .
we evaluated the effects of gsk256066 on airway responses to allergen challenge in mild asthmatics .
methods in a randomised , double blind , cross - over study , 24 steroid naive atopic asthmatics with both early ( ear ) and late ( lar ) responses to inhaled allergen received inhaled gsk256066 87.5 mcg once per day and placebo for 7 days , followed by allergen challenge .
methacholine reactivity was measured 24 h post - allergen .
plasma pharmacokinetics were measured .
the primary endpoint was the effect on lar .
results gsk256066 significantly reduced the lar , attenuating the fall in minimum and weighted mean fev1 by 26.2 % ( p = 0.007 ) and 34.3 % ( p = 0.005 ) respectively compared to placebo .
gsk256066 significantly reduced the ear , inhibiting the fall in minimum and weighted mean fev1 by 40.9 % ( p = 0.014 ) and 57.2 % ( p = 0.014 ) respectively compared to placebo .
there was no effect on pre - allergen fev1 or methacholine reactivity post allergen .
gsk256066 was well tolerated , with low systemic exposure ; plasma levels were not measurable after 4 hours in the majority of subjects .
conclusions gsk256066 demonstrated a protective effect on the ear and lar .
this is the first inhaled pde4 inhibitor to show therapeutic potential in asthma .
trial registration this study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov nct00380354 introduction inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of anti - inflammatory treatment in asthma [ 1 ] .
however , many patients remain symptomatic despite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids , even when combined with long acting beta agonists [ 2,3 ] .
new asthma treatments targeting inflammation are needed .
adenosine monophosphate ( camp ) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) cause smooth muscle relaxation and regulate immune cell function [ 4 ] .
these intracellular signalling molecules are inactivated by the phosphodiesterase ( pde ) family of metallophosphohydrolases , which can lead to smooth muscle contraction and increased immune cell activation [ 4,5 ] .
therefore , the non - selective oral pde inhibitor theophylline has been used as a treatment for asthma for many years .
however , it has a low therapeutic index due to limited potency and a poor side effect profile [ 6,7 ] .
the pde4 subfamily are highly expressed on inflammatory cells such as eosinophils , lymphocytes , macrophages and neutrophils [ 5,8 ] , so selective pde4 inhibitors have recently been developed with the aim of improving the therapeutic index .
animal models have shown this approach to be highly effective in reducing allergen induced inflammation [ 9,10 ] .
clinical studies have shown efficacy for orally administered pde4 selective inhibitors on relevant asthma endpoints such as inhibition of allergen challenge [ 11,12 ] and exercise induced bronchoconstriction [ 13 ] , as well as improvements in lung function [ 14 ] .
however , the tolerability of these orally administered drugs is still limited by side effects such as gastro - intestinal symptoms [ 15 - 17 ] .
the delivery of a selective and potent pde4 inhibitor by inhalation may improve the therapeutic index by limiting systemic exposure and delivering the drug directly to the target organ to increase therapeutic effects .
gsk256066 ( 6 - ({ 3 - [( dimethylamino ) carbonyl ] phenyl } sulfonyl ) - 8 - methyl - 4 - { [ 3 - methyloxy ) phenyl ] amino } - 3 - quinolinecarboxamide ) is a pde4 inhibitor that can be delivered by inhalation .
this compound is a very high affinity , slow - and tight - binding inhibitor of pde4 that is highly selective for pde4 over other pdes such as 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 and 7 , and shows efficacy in animal models of pulmonary inflammation [ 18 ] .
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of selective inhibition of pde4 with gsk256066 delivered by inhalation in the experimental allergen challenge model of allergic asthma .
we performed a double blind , placebo controlled , crossover study in steroid naive asthma patients to assess the effectiveness of gsk256066 .
we also measured systemic exposure to gsk256066 .
methods subjects 24 steroid naive patients with physician diagnosed asthma for at least 6 months were recruited - the demography of the patients is shown in table 1 .
subjects were required to be aged 18 to 55 years and non - smokers for at least 6 months with less than a 10 pack year history .
at screening patients were required to have a forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( fev1 ) > 75 % predicted , have a positive skin test to either house dust mite , grass pollen or cat allergen , and to demonstrate both an early and late asthmatic reaction to one of these allergens when inhaled .
subjects we also required to have haematology , biochemistry and creatinine clearance values within the normal ranges .
all patients provided written informed consent .
the study was approved by the local research ethics committee .
table 1 subject demography .
variable value age / years 31 ( 20 - 46 ) gender ( male / female ) 13 / 11 fev1 % predicted 90.1 ( 71.3 - 111.8 ) allergen used for bronchial challenge 14 dust mite , 5 cat dander , 5 grass mix mean ( range ) shown for age and fev1 .
study design this was a two centre , double - blind , randomised , placebo controlled , cross - over study .
eligible subjects were randomised to receive gsk256066 87.5 mug or matching placebo using an accuhaler ( tm ) once daily for 7 days - see fig 1 .
the washout period was 14 - 21 days between treatment periods .
dosing was performed under supervision at the sites on day 1 and day 7 .
on days 2 - 6 subjects were instructed to take the study medication at the same time of day , and were required to complete a diary card to document the time that medication was taken .
heart rate , blood pressure , ecgs , fev1 and exhaled nitric oxide ( feno ) were measured pre - dose on days 1 and 7 , and at 1 hr post - dose .
on day 7 , an inhaled allergen challenge was subsequently performed after the 1 hour post - dose fev1 and feno measurements .
methacholine challenge was then performed at 24 hours post allergen challenge .
adverse events and beta agonist use were monitored throughout the study with the aid of diary cards .

feno denotes exhaled nitric oxide .
allergen = inhaled allergen challenge .
methacholine = inhaled methacholine challenge .
allergen and methacholine challenges bronchial challenges were performed as we have previously described [ 19 ] using a mefar dosimeter ( mefar - bologna ) .
allergen for skin prick tests ( soluprick sq , alk abello ( uk ) ltd ) was stored at 4degreesc ; each subject was assessed for sensitivity to house dust mite , cat , grass pollen , and positive and negative controls .
the allergen for inhalation was selected according to the largest skin test wheal ( positive > 3 mm ) and clinical history .
fresh solutions of allergen were made up in 0.9 % saline in doubling concentrations from 250 sq - u / ml to 32 000 sq - u / ml. at screening , incremental doses of allergen were inhaled [ 19 ] until an early asthmatic response ( ear ) was observed , defined as a fall in fev1 of >= 20 % from the post saline value , on at least one occasion , between 5 and 30 minutes after the final concentration of allergen .
the late asthmatic response ( lar ) was defined as a fall in fev1 of >= 15 % from the post saline value , on at least three occasions , two of which must be consecutive , between 4 and 10 hours after the final concentration of allergen .
during the treatment periods , the total dose of allergen required to cause an ear and lar was administered as a single bolus dose .
subjects were administered doubling concentrations of methacholine from 0.03125 to 32 mg / ml until a >= 20 % fall in fev1 was achieved or the highest concentration of methacholine was administered .
the provocative concentration required to reduce the fev1 by 20 % of the post - saline baseline value ( pc20 ) was derived by linear interpolation between the lowest concentration that caused a > 20 % fall and the preceding concentration .
if the fev1 did not fall by more than 20 % following the highest concentration then the pc20 was set to the highest concentration given in the challenge .
if the fev1 fell by more than 20 % following the first concentration the pc20 was derived as [ 20x lowest concentration ]/[% fall following lowest concentration ] .
feno feno was measured using the ecomedics ag analyser cld 88 at a flow of 50 ml / s. three acceptable readings were recorded from each subject and the mean was used for analysis .
pharmacokinetic sampling and bioanalytical method on days 1 and 7 , blood samples were collected at pre - dose , 10 min , 30 min , 45 min and 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 24 hrs post dose for measurement of the levels of gsk256066 in plasma .
the active metabolite gsk614917 , which is 1.7 fold less potent than the parent compound , was also measured .
these pharmacokinetic analyses were performed by protein precipitation , followed by hplc / ms / ms. the lower limit of quantification ( lloq ) for gsk256066 and gsk614917 was 5 pg / ml , with an upper limit of quantification of 2000 pg / ml statistics minimum lar was derived as the minimum fev1 value over 4 - 10 hrs post allergen challenge .
minimum ear was derived as the minimum fev1 over 0 - 2 hrs post allergen challenge .
weighted mean lar and ear endpoints were derived by calculating the auc over the relevant time interval using the linear trapezoidal rule and dividing by the time interval .
the sample size was based on a power calculation using our previous allergen challenge data [ 19 ] ; in order to detect a 50 % attenuation of the minimum lar , with 90 % power at the two - sided 5 % significance level , 23 evaluable were required .
statistical analysis was performed on each of the absolute change from baseline lar and ear endpoints to compare gsk256066 with placebo .
a mixed effects model was fitted with the factors treatment , period and day 7 post - saline fev1 as fixed effects and subject as a random effect .
absolute change from post - saline fev1 data over planned relative time were obtained from a repeated measures statistical analysis , adjusting for the terms of period , treatment group , period - level post - saline baseline , subject - level post - saline baseline , planned relative time , treatment group by planned relative time interaction and period - level post - saline baseline by planned relative time interaction as fixed effects and subject as a random effect .
day 7 fev1 data ( pre - dose and 1 h post - dose ) were also analysed using a mixed effects model , adjusting for the fixed effects treatment , period and day 1 pre - dose fev1 and the random effect subject .
statistical analysis was performed on the log2 - transformed values of the provocative concentration of methacholine required to produce a 20 % reduction in fev1 ( pc20 ) to compare gsk256066 with placebo .
a mixed effects model was fitted with the factors treatment and period treated as fixed effects and subject as a random effect .
feno change from baseline ratio at all time points were analysed following a loge - transformation to compare gsk256066 with placebo .
a mixed effects model was fitted with the fixed effects period , treatment group , subject - level loge - transformed baseline , period - level loge - transformed baseline , planned relative time , treatment group by planned relative time interaction term and period - level loge - transformed baseline by planned relative time interaction term and the random effect subject .
values for the following pharmacokinetic were estimated directly from raw plasma concentration data : maximum plasma concentration ( cmax ) , time of maximum observed concentration ( tmax ) , and time of the last observable concentration ( tlast ) .
area under the plasma concentration - time curve from time zero to tlast ( auc ( 0 - t )) was estimated for subjects with at least 3 consecutive observable concentration values with the log up / linear down trapezoidal method using winnonlin professional version 5.2 ( pharsight corporation , cary , nc , usa ) .
results of the 24 subjects randomised , 19 completed the study ( see fig 2 ) .
one subject developed cough and wheeze after inhalation of 3 doses of gsk256066 which resolved within 24 hrs .
two subjects had evidence of high creatinine clearance during the study ; one after placebo , and one after three doses of gsk256066 .
two withdrawals occurred during placebo treatment ( the subjects did not receive gsk256066 ) ; one subject tested positive for cocaine , and one subject had abnormal ecg changes .

allergen challenge gsk256066 significantly reduced the ear ( see fig 3 ) , inhibiting the fall in both minimum and weighted mean fev1 by 40.9 % ( p = 0.014 ) and 57.2 % ( p = 0.014 ) respectively compared to placebo .
gsk256066 also significantly reduced the lar , attenuating the fall in both minimum and weighted mean fev1 by 26.2 % ( p = 0.007 ) and 34.3 % ( p = 0.005 ) respectively compared to placebo .

gsk256066 concentrations were above the lloq in 18 out of 22 subjects on day 1 and 17 out of 19 subjects on day 7 .
despite a very sensitive bioanalytical method ( lloq 5 pg / ml ) , on day 1 , the drug levels were below the lloq after 4 hrs post dose for the majority ( 18 ) of the 22 subjects .
on day 7 , 10 of the 19 subjects had drug levels were below the lloq after 4 hrs post dose .
only 1 subject on day 7 had levels above the lloq after 12 hrs .
the systemic exposure to gsk614917 was also low , as only 8 out of 22 subjects had levels above the lloq on day 1 , and 9 out of 19 on day 7 .
variability in systemic exposure was high ( coefficients of variation of auc ( 0 - t ) and cmax on day 1 of 89 % and 68 % , respectively ) , reflecting the difficulty in accurate characterisation of pharmacokinetic parameters when measurable concentrations are close to the limit of detection ( tlast ranged from 0.5 - 24 hours in this study ) .

discussion to our knowledge , this is the first study to show that an inhaled pde4 inhibitor inhibits the response to allergen challenge in asthma .
this placebo controlled study demonstrated that gsk256066 administered for 7 days significantly attenuated the fall in lung function in patients with asthma caused by inhaled allergen challenge .
gsk256066 had no effect on the secondary endpoints of methacholine reactivity post allergen challenge or exhaled nitric oxide .
nevertheless , the effects of gsk256066 on the allergen response which was the primary endpoint indicate that this drug has therapeutic potential for the treatment of asthma .
the delivery of this pde4 inhibitor by inhalation was associated with low systemic exposure .
larger clinical trials are needed to study the therapeutic index in more detail .
inhaled allergen challenge is a well recognised and robust model that is commonly used to assess the therapeutic potential of novel treatments for asthma [ 11,12,19 - 24 ] .
comparing the results of different allergen challenge studies should be done with caution , as methodological details such as the period of measurement of the late response can vary between studies ( we measured up to 10 hrs while some studies only measure up to 7 hrs ) , and individual patient characteristics may differ .
the results of the current study are therefore not directly comparable to the previous publication involving the orally administered pde4 inhibitor roflumilast , which inhibited the maximal fall in the ear and lar by 14 % and 33 % respectively .
inhibition of 40.9 % and 26.2 % respectively were observed in the current study .
direct head - to - head comparisons would be the best way to compare gsk256066 to roflumilast .
inhaled corticosteroids attenuate the fall in lung function caused by inhaled allergen , with results varying between studies for the absolute magnitude of inhibition depending on the dose and type of corticosteroid used [ 20,22 - 24 ] .
however , inhaled corticosteroids generally have a minimal effect on the ear [ 20,22,23 ] .
this may be due to the inability of corticosteroids to prevent mast cell degranulation .
in contrast , gsk256066 had a very significant inhibitory effect on the ear .
pde4 inhibition by gsk256066 may therefore offer more protection than corticosteroids against acute bronchoconstriction in clinical practice .
the lar is characterised by an inflammatory cell influx into the airways , comprising a variety of cell types including eosinophils , basophils and lymphocytes that are recruited by t - helper 2 ( th2 ) cytokines [ 25 ] .
the lar is therefore a well validated model to study inhibition of th2 driven inflammatory cell influx into the airways .
corticosteroids inhibit inflammatory gene transcription [ 26 ] , and therefore decrease the number and activity of inflammatory cells at tissue sites of inflammation .
inhaled corticosteroids therefore inhibit airway inflammation during the lar [ 20,22 - 24 ] .
the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast also inhibits th2 driven inflammation , and suppresses the lar [ 19,20 ] .
similarly , it has recently been shown that targeting the th2 cytokines il - 4 and il - 13 by blocking their common receptor with the il - 4 variant pitrakinra also inhibits the lar [ 21 ] .
pde4 is expressed on cells involved in th2 responses , such as eosinophils and lymphocytes [ 5,27 ] .
the current study would have been strengthened by proving that gsk256066 had an effect on these th2 cells .
nevertheless , our results agree with previous findings using roflumilast showing that pde4 inhibition attenuates the lar [ 12 ] , suggestive of inhibition of th2 inflammation .
there was no change in the secondary endpoint measurements of methacholine challenge post allergen , or exhaled no. however , the study was not statistically powered to examine these secondary endpoints , but was designed to evaluate the primary endpoint of the allergen challenge , where unequivocally positive results were observed .
studies using inhaled corticosteroids have shown both attenuation [ 20,24 ] and no attenuation [ 22 ] of methacholine reactivity post allergen challenge .
in line with these variable results , montelukast has also been shown to have no effect on methacholine reactivity post allergen challenge in one study [ 20 ] but an inhibitory effect in another [ 19 ] .
these variable results suggest that methacholine reactivity post allergen challenge is not a robust primary endpoint to evaluate drug effects .
it is clear that gsk256066 inhibits the fall in lung function during the lar , but unlike corticosteroids [ 20,24 ] we did not observe inhibition of allergen induced bronchial hyper - reactivity .
this may suggest differentiation of the effects of pde4 inhibitors and corticosteroids , although the inconsistent results in previous studies of methacholine reactivity post allergen challenge indicate that caution should be applied in the interpretation of these data .
reducing nitric oxide levels by specific inos inhibition does inhibit the ear or lar , suggesting that nitric oxide is not mechanistically involved in the pathophysiology of asthma [ 19 ] .
however , exhaled nitric oxide is a sensitive biomarker of the effects of inhaled corticosteroids [ 28 ] .
in contrast , the effects of the leukotriene receptor antagonist singulair are more variable , with no inhibition observed of nitric oxide observed in some studies [ 19,29 ] .
the usefulness of exhaled nitric oxide as a biomarker appears to vary with the class of drug , and our results suggest that airway nitric oxide production is a pde4 independent mechanism .
alternative explanations are that the current study was too short or underpowered to detect a reduction in exhaled nitric oxide .
there were few adverse effects in this study , although larger studies are needed to fully explore the safety profile .
however , the lack of nausea and / or gastro - intestinal side effects usually associated with oral pde4 inhibitors [ 15 - 17 ] indicates that the inhaled delivery of a pde4 inhibitor may minimise the potential for systemic side effects .
the pharmacokinetic analysis performed showed that systemic exposure to gsk256066 was extremely low , as some subjects did not have quantifiable exposure at any time - point despite measurement with a very sensitive analytical assay ( lloq of 5 pg / ml ) .
furthermore , the majority of subjects had levels below the lloq after 4 hrs on days 1 and 7 .
additionally , the mean cmax of gsk256066 was < 20 pg / ml on both of these days , while measurable levels of the active metabolite gsk614917 were even lower , underscoring the value of inhaled delivery to limit systemic exposure and the potential for systemic side effects .
in contrast , the mean cmax of roflumilast administered orally is over 2,000 pg / ml with levels of the active metabolite roflumilast n - oxide being even higher [ 30 ] .
clearly orally administered drugs will have higher plasma levels , but this comparison serves to highlight the low levels of systemic exposure with inhaled delivery for gsk256066 .
two subjects were withdrawn from this study with high creatinine clearance values .
this is because the protocol stated that subjects with abnormal creatinine clearance values defined by the laboratory reference range should be withdrawn , in order to exclude patients who developed renal dysfunction .
high creatinine clearance indicates good renal function , so there was no clinical concern about keeping these patients in the study .
however , the wording of the protocol stated that we had to withdraw these patients as the values were outside the laboratory reference range .
in retrospect , the protocol should have stated that patients with low creatinine clearance would be withdrawn .
it has recently been reported that the inhaled pde4 inhibitor uk - 500,001 had no effect on fev1 after 6 weeks of treatment in patients with copd [ 31 ] .
oral pde4 inhibitors have been reported to show clinical efficacy in copd patients [ 15 - 17 ] , but with a significant rate of side effects .
the effects of pde4 inhibitors will therefore vary according to a variety of factors including the potency of the drug and the route of delivery .
the current study using inhaled gsk256066 was focused on asthma , and studies using this drug in copd would be of interest .
this was the first time that gsk256066 had been given to patients with asthma , and so the side effect profile in this population was unknown .
pde4 inhibitors are known to cause adverse effects [ 15 - 17 ] , so we wanted to limit the duration of exposure in case gsk256066 caused significant adverse effects .
we chose 7 days treatment in order to limit the duration of exposure to a new drug with an unknown side effect profile , while at the same time treating for long enough to be able to measure any therapeutic effect .
future studies can use the preliminary safety data from the current study to investigate safety and efficacy over a longer duration , or using other dosing regimens .
in summary , we show that the inhaled pde4 inhibitor gsk256066 attenuates the allergen induced changes in pulmonary function in asthmatics. by limiting systemic exposure , this therapy has the potential to minimise side effects usually associated with pde inhibitors , and warrants further study in longer clinical trials .

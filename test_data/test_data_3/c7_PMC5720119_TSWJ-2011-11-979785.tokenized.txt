tuberculosis ( tb ) is a truly global disease , found in every country on earth .
one - third of humanity , over 2 billion people , carry the bacillus that causes tb and 2 million people die of the disease each year .
despite that , no new specific drug against mycobacterium tuberculosis has been developed since the 1960s .
there are several candidates for new anti - tb agents , but none proven clinically effective .
stilbenes are compounds found in numerous medicinal plants and food products with some known biological and even antimycobacterial activity .
this paper describes the synthesis and the anti - m. tuberculosis activity of eight stilbene analogues .
the synthesis and characterization of these compounds are shown , and the results compared with one " first " - line drug used in current therapy .

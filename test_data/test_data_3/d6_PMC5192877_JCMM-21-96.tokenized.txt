abstract nitric oxide ( no ) deficiency is common in pulmonary diseases , but its effect on pulmonary remodelling is still controversial .
as pulmonary parathyroid hormone - related protein ( pthrp ) expression is a key regulator of pulmonary fibrosis and development , the effect of chronic no deficiency on the pulmonary pthrp system and its relationship with oxidative stress was addressed .
no bioavailability in adult rats was reduced by systemic administration of l - name via tap water .
to clarify the role of no synthase ( nos ) - 3 - derived no on pulmonary expression of pthrp , nos - 3 - deficient mice were used .
captopril and hydralazine were used to reduce the hypertensive effect of l - name treatment and to interfere with the pulmonary renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) .
quantitative rt - pcr and immunoblot techniques were used to characterize the expression of key proteins involved in pulmonary remodelling .
l - name administration significantly reduced pulmonary no concentration and caused oxidative stress as characterized by increased pulmonary nitrite concentration and increased expression of nox2 , p47phox and p67phox .
furthermore , l - name induced the pulmonary expression of pthrp and of its corresponding receptor , pth - 1r .
expression of pthrp and pth - 1r correlated with the expression of two well - established pthrp downstream targets , adrp and ppargamma , suggesting an activation of the pulmonary pthrp system by no deficiency .
captopril reduced the expression of pthrp , profibrotic markers and ornithine decarboxylase , but neither that of pth - 1r nor that of adrp and ppargamma .
all transcriptional changes were confirmed in nos - 3 - deficient mice .
in conclusion , nos - 3 - derived no suppresses pulmonary pthrp and pth - 1r expression , thereby modifying pulmonary remodelling .

in the lung , the main source of no is endothelial no synthase ( enos = nos - 3 ) that is expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells 1 , 2 , 3 .
inhalation of low levels of no dilates vessels within well - ventilated regions of the lung indicating a physiological role for no in pulmonary perfusion control .
inhaled no was also found to normalize excessive elastin deposition as found in chronic lung disease 4 .
endothelial dysfunction is associated with an inability of cells to release no and it is found in many forms of pulmonary disease such as pulmonary arterial hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , congestive heart failure and diabetes 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .
however , excessive no release is also contradictory to maintain a proper pulmonary function .
in caveolin - 1 - deficient mice , a subsequent persistent activation of enos leads to nitration of protein kinase g , thereby inhibiting no signalling pathways 10 .
furthermore , no decreases the expression of surfactant proteins in primary cultures of type ii pneumocytes and in experimental lung transplantation 11 , 12 .
as expected from these findings , nos inhibition can restore pulmonary function under some conditions such as in hyperoxia - induced lung injury in newborn rats and nickel - induced acute lung injury 1 , 13 .
interestingly , inhibition of enos was found to restore surfactant gene expression 1 but a mechanistic link between enos - derived no deficiency and restored surfactant formation is lacking .
a central role in structural adaptation of the lung plays the expression of parathyroid hormone - related protein ( pthrp ) .
pthrp binds to pth - 1 receptors ( pth - 1r ) and thereby it activates adenylyl cyclase and subsequently camp - dependent protein kinase a. in the lung , this leads to an increased expression of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( ppar ) - gamma , leptin , and adipose differentiation - related protein ( adrp ) , an increased uptake of triglycerides , a prerequisite for surfactant formation , and finally attenuation of alveolar lipofibroblast - to - myofibroblast transdifferentiation 14 .
as expected from these previous findings , elevated pthrp in epithelial lining fluid negatively correlates with the severity of lung injury in humans 15 .
acute inhibition of no formation reduces the secretion of surfactant proteins .
however , high levels of no reduced atp - induced surfactant secretion of type - ii alveolar cells 16 .
as both no and pthrp are related to surfactant and pulmonary structure formation , we suggested that no affects the lung by interfering with pthrp expression and pth - 1r activation .
reduced nos activity is common in many forms of pulmonary disease and favours oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrosis 17 , 18 .
the coupling between low no level and oxidative stress is a complex interplay between radical production by uncoupling of nos and activation of a local renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) 19 , 20 , 21 .
a ras - dependent activation of pulmonary transforming growth factor ( tgf ) - beta1 expression may couple ras activation and fibrosis with oxidative stress 21 .
on the other hand , reduced levels of no favour surfactant formation and attenuate pulmonary fibrosis 1 , 14 .
thus , it is highly unclear how reduced no formation will affect pulmonary structure and remodelling and therefore it remains unclear how the no system can be used to improve future therapy of life - threatening lung diseases .
in this study , we used two different models of no deficiency , nomega - nitro - l - arginine methyl ester ( l - name ) - treated rats and enos - deficient mice , to study the effect of low no formation on the activation of the pulmonary pthrp system , alveolar lipofibroblast - to - myofibroblast transdifferentiation and oxidative stress .
subsequently , inhibition of the local ras system by an angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor , captopril and administration of a direct vasodilating drug , hydralazine , was used to separate effects linked to no deficiency from haemodynamic vascular stress .
collectively our data will show a constitutive repressive role of enos - derived no on the activation of the pulmonary pthrp system .
materials and methods mice , rats and treatment protocols l - name treatment ( 30 mg / kg / day in tap water ) has been used before to affect no levels in rats 22 .
captopril ( 30 mg / kg / day in tap water ) or hydralazine ( 20 mg / kg / day in tap water ) was administered as described 22 , 23 .
l - name was administered to rats for 2 weeks before either captopril or hydralazine were added with continuation of l - name treatment .
enos - / - mice were purchased from jackson laboratory ( strain nos3tm1unc ) .
they were crossed with c57bl / 6j mice and genotyped by tail biopsies with subsequent polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) as described before 23 , 24 .
all rats and mice underwent a weekly health scoring 25 .
to sacrifice the animals , rats and mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane prior to cervical dislocation and the lungs were quickly removed and stored in fluid nitrogen until analysis .
the animal experiments were approved by the local authorities .
cardiac tissue derived from these animals has already been characterized 23 .
blood pressure for determination of blood pressure , rats or mice were set in a separate chamber and blood pressure ( peak systolic blood pressure ) was determined via the tail - cuff method ( tse - system , 209000 series ) as described before 22 .
briefly , the mean of 10 consecutive readings was obtained for each animal at weekly intervals .
before the start of the study , the animals were adjusted to the experimental procedure over 1 week .
measurement of peroxynitrite to estimate peroxynitrite formation in the kidney , we measured peroxynitrite marker nitrotyrosine by elisa ( components from cayman chemicals , ann arbor , michigan , usa ) as previously described 23 .
briefly , lung tissue samples were pulverized in liquid nitrogen , sonicated in 4x homogenzation buffer and centrifuged .
supernatants were then incubated overnight with an anti - nitrotyrosine rabbit igg and nitrotyrosine acetylcholinesterase tracer in pre - coated ( mouse anti - rabbit igg ) microplates flowed by development with ellman 's reagent .
protein concentration of the samples was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay .
measurement of nitric oxide nitric oxide was determined in tissue samples by electron spin resonance technique as described before in detail 26 .
briefly , diethyldithiocarbamate dissolved in distilled water was injected separately from feso4 and sodium citrate to avoid precipitation of fe2 +( detc ) 3 .
five minutes after treatment , lungs were isolated and freeze clamped .
approximately 100 mg of tissue was placed into quartz tubes and stored in liquid nitrogen until assayed for esr spectra of no - fe2 + - ( detc ) 2 complex .
electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectra were recorded with bruker ecs 106 ( rheinstetten , germany ) spectrometer .
qrt - pcr total rna was isolated from lungs using peqgold trifast ( peqlab ; biotechnology gmbh , erlangen , germany ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol as described before for heart tissues 22 .
to remove genomic dna contamination , isolated rna samples were treated with 1 u desoxyribonuclease per microgram rna ( invitrogen , karlsruhe , germany ) for 15 min .
at 37degreesc .
one microgram of total rna was used in a 10 - mul reaction to synthesize cdna using superscript rnaseh reverse transcriptase ( 200 u / mug rna ; invitrogen ) and oligo dts as primers .
real - time quantitative pcr was performed with the icycler iq detection system ( bio - rad , munich , germany ) in combination with iq sybr green real - time pcr supermix ( bio - rad ) .
primers used had the sequences according to table 1 .
quantification was performed as described before 27 .

samples ( 100 mug ) were loaded on a 12.5 % sds - page and blotted onto membranes as described before 22 .
blots were incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed against pthrp ( antibody gf08 ; calbiochem , bad soden , germany ) or pth - 1 receptor ( antibody 3d1.1 ; upstate biotechnology , eschborn , gerrmany ) as described before 28 and a second antibody coupled to horse radish peroxidase .
surfactant production was quantified by immunoblots detecting surfactant protein - c ( sp - c ; antibody fl - 197 , sc - 13979 santa cruz biotechnology ) and lipofibroblast - to - myofibroblast transdifferentiation was analysed by up - regulation of alpha - smooth muscle protein ( antibody clone 1a4 , c6198 from sigma - aldrich ; st. louis , usa ) .
statistics data are expressed as mean +/ - s.d. anova and , if indicated , student - neuman - keuls test for post hoc analysis were used to analyse experiments in which more than one group was compared .
exact p values for anova testing is given in the figure legend or a p value of < 0.05 compared to the respective control group is indicated by an asterisk .
in cases where only two groups were compared , this was done by unpaired t - test or mann - whitney test depending on the equal distribution of the samples as determined by levene test .
results effect of l - name administration on pulmonary no formation and oxidative stress first , we proved that l - name administration to rats successfully reduces pulmonary no levels .
therefore , no levels were quantified by esr ( fig. 1a ) .
the data show that l - name significantly reduced no formation by 90.7 % .
in parallel , reduced no formation was accompanied by elevated pulmonary content of nitrotyrosin indicating elevated oxidative stress and functionally relevant modification of target proteins ( fig. 1b ) .
moreover , l - name administration led to a significant up - regulation of enzymes involved in the formation of reactive oxidative species ( ros ) , such as nox2 , p47phox and p67phox ( fig.2 ) .
finally , l - name administration induced systemic hypertension ( table 2 ) .
collectively , these data confirmed known effects of no deficiency and indicate the effectiveness of the protocol - name dosage used here .

john wiley & sons , ltd effect of no deficiency on the pthrp system once we have established that l - name administration significantly affected pulmonary no formation , we investigated next , whether l - name administration modifies the expression of pthrp and pth - 1r in the lung .
l - name significantly increased the pulmonary expression of both proteins ( fig. 3a - d ) .
furthermore , pulmonary expression of pthrp mrna and pth - 1r mrna strongly correlated with the mrna expression of its downstream target genes adrp and ppargamma ( p = 0.017 , r 2 = 0.233 and p = 0.006 , r 2 = 0.433 respectively ) .
similarly , mean expression of adrp and ppargamma were increased in l - name - treated rats with elevated pthrp and pth - 1r expression , although the large variation suppressed p values below 0.05 ( fig. 3 ) .
more importantly , l - name - induced increase of the mrna expression of pthrp and of its corresponding receptor was confirmed on the protein level ( fig. 4a - c ) .
an activation of the pthrp system has been linked initially to surfactant production 14 .
however , pth - 1r null mice had no difference in the expression of surfactant proteins , such as surfactant protein ( sp ) - c 29 .
in line with the latter findings , we did not find differences in the expression of sp - c ( fig. 4d,e ) .

representative immunoblot is shown ( a , d ) ; data are mean +/ - s.e.m. from n = 4 - 6 samples .
as the pthrp system attenuates an alveolar lipofibroblast - to - myofibroblast transdifferentiation , an initial step of pulmonary fibrosis , we expected that l - name - induced pthrp expression will repress elastin expression and therefore pulmonary fibrosis .
however , in l - name - treated rats elastin , collagen - 1 and tgf - beta1 were all up - regulated as well as ornithine decarboxylase ( odc ) , a marker of cell growth ( fig. 3e - h ) .
this suggests an onset of pulmonary fibrosis and this was confirmed on the protein level because the concentration of alpha - smooth muscle actin increased ( fig. 4d,f ) .
effect of captopril and hydralazine on l - name - induced changes the large variation in adrp and ppargamma expression suggests co - regulation by further factors .
l - name treatment is associated with an activation of ras and with hypertension .
therefore , participation of ras activation and hypertension in the aforementioned changes in pthrp expression were investigated next .
in the presence of captopril and hydralazine , blood pressure dropped ( table 2 ) .
captopril normalized the expression of pthrp and adrp , but not that of pth - 1r and ppargamma .
reducing the blood pressure by administration of hydralazine was less effective than inhibiting the ras ( fig. 5a - d ) .
figure 5 effect of captopril and hydralazine on l - name - induced changes in the pulmonary mrna expression of pthrp , pth - 1 receptor , and pthrp downstream targets adrp and ppargamma and that of fibrotic markers .
data are mean +/ - s.d. from n = 6 samples .
exact p values are given * , p < 0.05 vs. control .
pulmonary fibrosis , as indicated by up - regulation of elastin , collagen - 1 , tgf - beta1 and odc , was attenuated by captopril but not by hydralazine .
this suggests that pulmonary fibrosis is triggered by the activation of ras rather than by high blood pressure ( fig. 5e - h ) .
pulmonary pthrp expression in enos - deficient mice the aforementioned results suggest that pulmonary no significantly controls the expression of pthrp and thereby also of its down - stream targets adrp and ppargamma .
as enos - derived no is the main source of pulmonary no , we finally investigated whether the above mentioned changes are depending on enos - derived no. pulmonary expression of pthrp , pth - 1r , adrp and ppargamma were all significantly elevated in enos - deficient mice ( fig. 6a - d ) .
in contrast , the pulmonary expression of fibrotic markers was less significantly affected by enos deficiency and only small increases in elastin and odc were found ( fig. 6e - h ) .
figure 6 effect of enos deficiency on pulmonary expression of pthrp ( a ) , pth - 1 receptor ( b ) , adrp ( c ) , ppargamma ( d ) , elastin ( e ) ; collagen - 1 ( f ) , tgf - beta1 ( g ) , and odc ( h ) in wild - type mice (+/+) , heterozygous mice (+/ - ) and enos knockout mice ( - / - ) .
* , p < 0.05 vs. enos +/+ data are mean +/ - s.d. from n = 9 - 23 mice .
discussion this study evaluates the role of no for pulmonary expression and activity of the pthrp system .
in the lung , pthrp is expected to increase surfactant production and to reduce lipofibroblast - to - myofibroblast transdifferentiation 14 .
the main finding of this study is that no deficiency directly increases the pulmonary expression of pthrp and of pth - 1r. of note , this effect was similarly found in l - name - treated rats and enos - deficient mice .
therefore , the data of this study identify enos - derived no as an endogenous inhibitor of the pulmonary pthrp system .
furthermore , the data of this study show that no represses the pulmonary expression of adrp and ppargamma .
both proteins are regulated in a pthrp - dependent way .
in vitro findings suggested that high no levels suppress surfactant secretion and vice versa 16 .
this process depends on the activation of the pthrp system .
here , we observed the opposite effect and therefore forced the view that no suppresses surfactant formation but lowering no levels increases the pthrp pathway .
mir33 has been reported to depress pthrp expression and may be a candidate that triggers this effects 29 .
a link between no / cgmp and mir33 , however , is still missing .
a direct coupling of increased expression of pthrp and its down - stream targets ppargamma and adrp to surfactant formation would require an increased expression of sp - c , but this was not found .
in agreement with these findings , studies with pth - 1r null mice have already shown that pthrp may not be linked to lung development as receptor deficiency does not affect major peripheral proteins of the lung 30 .
a dysfunctional pulmonary no system has been implicated in many forms of lung disease .
this might be expected because pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells express the same constitutive isoform of nos , namely enos .
interestingly , while inhaled no and stimulation of downstream targets of no , such as soluble guanylyl cyclase activators , suppress some forms of lung disease and inhibit pulmonary fibrosis , blockade of no formation was found to be beneficial in other conditions 31 .
thus , the role of no in adaptation of pulmonary structure and function under stress conditions seems to be very complex in nature .
our study confirmed earlier reports about an effect of l - name on pulmonary fibrosis .
in no - deficient mice and l - name - treated rats , pulmonary expressions of fibrotic markers were collectively up - regulated under hypobaric hypoxia 17 , 32 .
the expression of elastin and collagen - 1 were no longer increased when l - name was administered in the presence of captopril .
in the presence of captopril , the level of tgf - beta1 expression was at least lower than that induced by l - name alone .
in summary , this part of the study suggests that l - name causes pulmonary fibrosis via an activation of ras .
the lung has the highest angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) activity compared to aorta , heart or kidney .
however , in contrast to the aforementioned tissues , l - name does not further increase its already high activity 19 .
therefore , we suggest that activation of ras upstream of ace triggers captopril - sensitive effects of l - name on pulmonary remodelling .
in line with these assumptions , transgenic ( mren2 ) 27 rats display increased expression of components of nox and a similar increase was obtained here in the tissue samples of l - name - treated rats 21 .
the conclusion that ras rather than haemodynamic load causes the observed pulmonary fibrosis is supported by our finding that hydralazine did not cause a similar effect as captopril although it had a clear vasodilating effect .
in principle , ras - dependent activation of tgf - beta may also directly increase the expression of pthrp in the lung .
tgf - beta1 induces the wnt signalling in osteolytic breast cancer cells and up - regulates pthrp 33 .
however , it is unlikely that in the absence of no , the wnt pathway affects pulmonary expression of pthrp .
first , in enos - deficient mice , pthrp expression is strongly increased in the absence of increased expression of tgf - beta1 .
second , in rats captopril attenuated the expression of tgf - beta1 but neither that of pth - 1r nor that of ppargamma .
furthermore , nicotine induces the wnt pathway , but decreases the expression of pthrp and ppargamma 34 .
therefore , the role of the wnt pathway in pulmonary expression of pthrp has to be established in the future .
alternatively , activation of the notch pathway has been linked to epithelial - mesenchymal transition .
however , although in vitro studies with breast cancer cells suggest a notch - dependent co - regulation of pthrp pathways and epithelial - mesenchymal transition 33 , our own experiments in vivo with no deficiency suggest a different regulation of these pathways .
this makes it unlikely that notch activation plays a relevant role .
in this study we used the expression of elastin as a marker of pulmonary fibrosis because excessive elastin deposition characterizes chronic lung disease 4 .
furthermore , we analysed the pulmonary expression of collagen - 1 and tgf - beta1 because epithelial - mesenchymal transition is favoured by tgf - beta1 - and tgf - beta1 - dependent collagen - 1 synthesis but reciprocally expressed in the presence of no 35 .
epithelial - mesenchymal transition was further confirmed by increased alpha - smooth muscle protein .
finally , we analysed the expression of pulmonary ornithine decarboxylase ( odc ) because this rate - limiting enzyme of the polyamine metabolism is required for pulmonary tissue growth and remodelling 36 .
in our study , no deficiency affected the pthrp system and the ras - tgf - beta1 cascade in a different way .
therefore , we conclude that the pulmonary pthrp system seems more closely linked to adrp and ppargamma rather than to inhibition of pulmonary fibrosis .
this does not mean that an activated pthrp system does not attenuate the alveolar transepithelial - to - myofibroblast transdifferentiation , as suggested before , but in the context of no deficiency its main effect is on adrp and ppargamma expression rather than on fibrosis .
at the same time , an activation of ras overrides a potential anti - fibrotic effect of pthrp. from a therapeutic point of view this leads to a dilemma : although no deficiency increases pthrp expression and thereby adrp and ppargamma expression , the same trigger favours pulmonary fibrosis .
an activation of ras and ras - dependent oxidative stress may support this consequence of no deficiency as this went alongside with increased expression of nox2 , p47phox and p67phox .
indeed , we found not only a significant drop in pulmonary no , as determined by direct measurement of no by esr but also an increase in tissue nitrotyrosine , a marker of oxidative stress relative to no. in summary we came to the following view as indicated in fig. 7 : no constitutively represses pulmonary pthrp and pth - 1r expression thereby keeping expression of adrp and ppargamma rather low .
no deficiency and the lack of soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulation activates ras that then triggers pulmonary fibrosis most probably by its ros - forming effect .
at the same time , pulmonary pthrp is induced but not sufficient to compensate the pro - fibrotic effect of ras activation .
figure 7 conclusive summary of the data obtained in this study .
no constitutively represses the pulmonary expression of pthrp in alveolar type ii cells ( 1 ) and pth - 1 receptors ( 2 ) in lipofibroblasts , thereby controlling their expression of adrp and ppargamma , two proteins required for proper formation of surfactant .
ras seems to modify pulmonary fibrosis independent of a potential role of pthrp for the transition of alveolar lipofibroblasts to myofibroblasts .
conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no competing interest .

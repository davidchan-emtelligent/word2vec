emerging cardiovascular biomarkers , such as speckle tracking echocardiography ( ste ) and aortic pulse wave velocity ( apwv ) , have recently demonstrated the presence of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction and arterial stiffening in patients with chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) and no previous cardiovascular history .
however , limited information exists on the prognostic impact of these biomarkers .
we aimed to investigate whether ste and apwv predict major adverse cardiac events ( mace ) in this patient population .
in this cohort study we prospectively analysed 106 ckd patients with no overt cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) and normal left ventricular ejection fraction .
cardiac deformation was measured using ste while apwv was measured using arterial tonometry .
the primary end - point was the composite of all - cause mortality , acute coronary syndrome , stable angina requiring revascularization ( either using percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery ) , hospitalization for heart failure and stroke .
over a median follow up period of 49 months ( interquartile range 11 - 63 months ) , 26 patients ( 24.5 %) reached the primary endpoint .
in a multivariable cox hazards model , global longitudinal strain ( gls ) ( hr 1.12 , 95 % ci 1.02 - 1.29 , p = 0.041 ) and apwv ( hr 1.31 , 95 % ci 1.05 - 1.41 , p = 0.021 ) were significant , independent predictors of mace .
gls and apwv independently predict mace in ckd patients with normal ef and no clinically overt cvd .
keywords chronic kidney disease speckle tracking echocardiography aortic pulse wave velocity cardiovascular outcomes fundacao para a ciencia e a tecnologia ( pt ) sfrh / bd / 73646 sulemane samir issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media dordrecht 2017 introduction chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) patients are a group at significantly increased risk of cardiovascular ( cv ) events , as a result of prolonged exposure to an ever - growing array of traditional and non - traditional risk factors [ 1 ] .
most risk factors exert their influence on the myocardium and arterial wall itself , causing collateral damage to organs when circulatory function is altered sufficiently to result in clinical disease [ 2 ] .
the process of circulatory damage occurs over many years , and although outcomes [ such as stroke or myocardial infarction ( mi )] occur at identifiable discrete times , it is much more difficult to cross - sectionally assess the influence of established biomarkers of cv risk , such as glucose or cholesterol , without some surrogate for cardiovascular outcomes [ 3 ] .
in the last few years a number of surrogate markers of subclinical myocardial and arterial dysfunction have emerged to quantify the degree of subclinical cv impairment .
these surrogate markers are particularly relevant to ckd , a population at increased risk of cv disease ( cvd ) [ 1 ] .
conventional echocardiographic measures of left ventricular ( lv ) geometry , structure and function are significant predictors of outcomes in the ckd population .
prevalence of lv hypertrophy ( lvh ) [ 4 , 5 ] , diastolic dysfunction ( dd ) and lv systolic impairment [ 6 - 9 ] , predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes and increased and mortality .
although of importance the bulk of echocardiographic studies have been performed in the presence of major structural and functional cardiac abnormalities .
recently , speckle - tracking analysis , a novel echocardiographic technique that assesses intrinsic deformation ( strain ) of the myocardium has been proposed as a sensitive tool to detect myocardial dysfunction before a decrease in lv ejection fraction ( lvef ) occurs [ 10 ] .
additionally , speckle - tracking echocardiography ( ste ) has been validated against sonomicrometry and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( cmri ) [ 11 ] .
currently , some authors have used ste to investigate the predictive value of subclinical myocardial disease in both end stage renal failure ( esrf ) [ 12 ] and ckd [ 13 ] .
although these studies provide some insight into the relationship between subclinical myocardial disease and cv mortality they are limited by the fact that novel elements of deformation , such as strain rate ( sr ) or lv twist , were not studied .
in addition large proportions of the population had previous cardiac events , confounding the significance of ste parameters in asymptomatic patients without previous cardiovascular history .
previous studies have also shown that aortic stiffness as measured by aortic pulse wave velocity ( apwv ) predicts cardiovascular mortality in patients with ckd [ 14 ] and esrf [ 15 ] .
furthermore , recent work demonstrated that arterial remodelling is associated with ckd progression [ 16 ] and that in advanced ckd , stiffness parameters can predict ckd progression [ 17 ] .
despite this , no prospective data is available analysing the role of apwv in predicting major adverse cv events in ckd patients with normal lvef .
the current study hypothesized that subclinical markers of myocardial ( ste ) and vascular ( apwv ) disease can provide important prognostic value in predicting major adverse cardiac events ( mace ) in ckd patients ( of all stages ) with no overt cvd and normal lvef by conventional echocardiography .
methods study population a prospective , observational cohort study was conducted involving 121 consecutive patients , recruited from outpatient nephrology clinics at hammersmith and charing cross hospitals , imperial college healthcare nhs , london , uk. written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was approved by the uk national research ethics committee service ( rec 10 / h0704 / 81 ) .
the study conforms to the principles outlined in the declaration of helsinki .
patients on haemodialysis , or those with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of lv systolic dysfunction ( simpson biplane lvef < 55 %) , presence of regional wall motion abnormalities , significant valvular abnormalities ( moderate or severe ) , presence of atrial fibrillation or flutter , known pulmonary hypertension , congenital heart disease , cardiomyopathy , pericardial disease , or inadequate echocardiographic acoustic windows were excluded from this study .
all patients were asymptomatic from a cardiovascular point of view , and had normal systolic function , as assessed by conventional echocardiography .
we carefully reviewed the clinical notes for all patients and any patient displaying evidence or signs of heart failure was excluded from the study .
study protocol ckd etiology , cardiovascular risk factors , and detailed drug history were recorded .
bio - chemical results were obtained from the most recent renal clinic review , provided that there was no evidence of superimposed acute kidney injury during the time of blood sampling .
the value of estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) was calculated using the four - variable equation in the modification of diet in renal disease ( mdrd ) study [ 18 ] .
follow - up all participants were followed up for a median time of 49 months ( interquartile range 11 - 63 months ) .
the primary end - point was a composite of all - cause mortality , acute coronary syndrome , stable angina requiring revascularization [ either using percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) or coronary artery bypass surgery ( cabg )] , hospitalization for heart failure and stroke .
deaths were identified from the office of national statistics ( ons ) .
all patients were followed up either in outpatient clinics or by telephone conversation .
conventional echocardiography all echocardiographic parameters were obtained using the vivd 7 echocardiographic machine ( ge healthcare , little chalfont , united kingdom ) .
the images obtained were stored and subsequently analyzed offline in echopac version 12 ( ge healthcare ) by a single , accredited investigator blinded to all baseline data .
lvef was obtained using the modified simpson 's rule [ 19 ] .
lv dimensions and lv wall thickness were measured in the parasternal long axis view [ 19 ] .
left atrial ( la ) volume indexed to body surface area ( lavi ) was measured using the la disk summation algorithm [ 19 ] .
lv mass was estimated using the deveraux formula [ 20 ] and posteriorly indexed to the body surface area to obtain the left ventricular mass index ( lvmi ) .
pulse wave doppler in the 4 - chamber view was used to assess mitral inflow patterns ( e / a ratio , deceleration time ) .
pulsed wave tissue doppler imaging of both the lateral and septal walls was performed to measure early diastolic e tissue velocity ( e ') .
to assess lv filling pressures we calculated e / e ' [ 21 ] .
the algorithm to detect and classify the severity of lv diastolic dysfunction was based in the current recommendations for the evaluation of lv diastolic function by echocardiography [ 21 ] .
speckle tracking echocardiography customized software performed the speckle tracking analysis for vivid 7 ( 2d - strain echopac pc v.7.0.1 , ge healthcare little chalfont , united kingdom ) .
global longitudinal strain ( gls ) fig. 1 and strain rate ( glsr ) were obtained from the three apical views .
global circumferential strain ( gcs ) and strain rate ( gcsr ) values were obtained from the basal , mid , and apical short - axis planes .
global strain values were calculated from the average of the 18 segments in the longitudinal or circumferential planes .
lv twist was calculated as the net difference in peak systolic rotational strain between the six basal and six apical segments .
the early and late diastolic sr parameters sre and sra were calculated from 18 segments in the longitudinal direction .
a sre / sra ratio < 1.1 was regarded as an index of altered segmental relaxation - - segmental dd [ 22 ] .
the total number of segmental dd was calculated for all participants. fig. 1 left ventricular global longitudinal strain ( gls ) in a chronic kidney disease patient who did not reach the primary endpoint ( mace ) .
gls represents the average value of the peak systolic longitudinal strain of the three apical views ( four - chamber , two - chamber , and long - axis ) , using a 17 - segment model .
the bottom right graph depicts a bulls - eye plot with regional ( each segment ) and global ( average ) strain .
nearly normal strain is represented in red , whereas impaired strain is represented in shades of red / pink , with areas of most impaired strain depicted in very light pink or blue .
in this patient lv gls was within normal limits at - 21.2 % .
avc aortic valve closure , aplax apical long axis , 2ch two - chamber , 4ch four - chamber vascular stiffness on the same day , approximately 10 min after performing the echocardiogram , blood pressure was measured with the subjects still in a supine position .
pressure waveforms were recorded on the carotid and femoral arteries using applanation tonometry [ 23 ] .
carotid - femoral apwv fig. 2 was calculated using a commercially available device ( sphygmocor , pulse wave analysis system , atcor medical ) , with a high - fidelity millar strain - gauge transducer ( millar instruments , houston , tx ) as described previously [ 24 ] .
two separate operators collected the measurements with coefficient of variation of < 10 %. fig. 2 aortic pwv was measured using the foot - to - foot velocity method from various waveforms .
these are usually obtained , transcutaneously at the common carotid artery and the femoral artery ( i.e. ' carotid - femoral ' pwv - deltal ) , and the time delay ( deltat or transit time ) measured between the feet of the two waveforms statistical analysis spss v22 ( ibm corp. armonk , ny , 2015 ) was used for statistical analysis .
normality of the variables assessed was tested using the kolmogorov - smirnov test .
data are presented as mean +/ - sd. continuous variables were compared using a student 's t test and categorical variables using the chi square or fisher 's exact test as appropriate .
estimated primary outcome free survival in different groups was calculated using the kaplan meier method , and comparisons were made using the log - rank test .
multivariate cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of the primary outcome .
two tailed p values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
results following the exclusion of patients with poor endocardial definition ( 9 ) and pre - existing structural heart disease ( 6 ) at baseline echocardiography , the final patient population included 106 patients .
reproducibility we previously demonstrated excellent intra and inter - observer agreement of ste and apwv values between individuals [ 25 ] .
baseline clinical and imaging characteristics according to the primary endpoint median follow up was 49 months ( interquartile range 11 - 63 months ) .
overall 26 patients ( 24.5 %) reached the primary end point .
during the follow up period , five deaths ( 4.7 %) ( 3 due to heart failure , one sudden death and one due to sepsis ) , four st elevation mi ( 3.8 %) , two non - st elevation mi ( 1.9 %) , three admissions for urgent pci ( 2.8 %) , five admissions for an elective pci ( 4.7 %) , three cabg revascularizations ( 2.8 %) , one unstable angina [ leading to cabg revascularization ( 0.9 %)] , one admission for heart failure ( 0.9 %) and two strokes ( 1.9 %) occurred .
the baseline clinical and imaging characteristics are shown in table 1 .
there were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between patients suffering mace and those who did not .
patients who suffered mace had higher bmi ( 27.5 vs. 24.3 , p = 0.04 ) , lower egfr ( 23.2 vs. 47.5 , p < 0.001 ) and a higher percentage of hypertensive heart disease ( 82 % vs. 65 % p = 0.01 ) .
baseline gls ( - 16.8 % vs. - 19.1 % , p < 0.001 ) and glsr ( - 0.78 vs. - 1.03 m.s , p = 0.01 ) were significantly decreased in patients suffering mace , while lv twist ( 19.3degrees vs. 16.3degrees p = 0.05 ) and apwv ( 11.5 vs. 8.6 m / s p < 0.001 ) were significantly higher .

few studies have addressed the relationship between gls and cv mortality in ckd patients .
in 2014 , a single - centre study by krishnasamy et al .
[ 13 ] examined the association between gls and all - cause mortality in 447 ckd patients .
in the 5 - year follow - up period , gls was a significant independent predictor of mortality ( hr 1.08 , 95 % ci 1.01 - 1.15 ) [ 13 ] .
more recently , kramann et al. demonstrated the ability of strain parameters to identify uremic cardiomyopathy and predict cv mortality in dialysis patients [ 12 ]. of interest , however , a large portion of the patients included in the afore - mentioned studies had already suffered a cardiovascular event , hence confounding the significance of their results in patients with no clinical cardiovascular disease .
additionally , gls has been shown to be sensitive to loading conditions , especially afterload [ 30 ] consequently , variations in gls measurements due to loading conditions occur in dialysis patients and results from such studies should be viewed with caution .
lastly , novel deformation parameters ( i.e. lv twist or strain rate ) were not assessed .
speckle tracking echocardiography allows direct assessment of myocardial muscle shortening and lengthening by assessing not only strain , but also strain rate and lv rotation / twist [ 31 ] .
in the current study we used a wide range of subclinical cardiovascular measures such as strain , strain rate , lv twist , number of segments with dd or apwv , in an attempt to identify subclinical prognostic information .
our cohort encompassed ckd patients at all stages , with no previous history of cvd , while dialysis patients were excluded .
our results demonstrated a significant , independent relationship between impaired gls and mace in ckd patients with no cvd and normal ef on conventional echocardiography .
in our cohort a gls of - 17.7 % or less had a good discriminative power ( sensitive and specificity ) to predict mace .
another interesting finding of the current study is that , at baseline , patients that reached our composite primary endpoint ( mace ) had significantly impaired gls compared to patients who did not suffer mace , even though lvef was similar in both groups .
this fact suggests that gls may be able to detect ckd - related myocardial changes early in its course , as it primarily evaluates the function of subendocardial longitudinal fibres that are more sensitive to cardiac injury [ 32 ] .
in fact , animal and human studies support the idea that changes in myocardial composition and function that are fuelled by traditional ( hypertension , diabetes ) and non - traditional ( oxidative stress , inflammation , thrombosis ) risk factors occur early in the course of the disease , prior to the onset of clinical manifestations [ 33 , 34 ] , supporting the hypothesis that gls could act as a cv biomarker of outcome in the high risk cohort of ckd patients .
the majority of deaths in our cohort were caused by heart failure ( 3 / 5 ) .
in patients with heart failure , gls was shown to be a superior predictor of cardiac events and all - cause mortality compared to ef [ 29 , 35 ] .
gls is impaired in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction ( hfpef ) [ 36 , 37 ] .
this relates to the fact that subendocardial function is likely to be impaired in diastolic heart failure patients while epicardial / transmural function remains preserved which explains the preserved lv ejection fraction ( lvef ) .
abnormal longitudinal function in this cohort can be detected at an earlier stage by examining subendocardial function , by cardiac magnetic ressonace [ 38 ] or by gls measurement [ 37 ] .
this suggests that gls could act as more sensitive prognostic biomarker for hfpef patients .
none of the remaining deformation parameters were significant predictors of cv events .
due to the derivation of strain , sr is inherently noisier than strain , and previous correlations between mri tagging and ste were poorer for sr when compared with strain [ 39 ] , which may partly explain our findings .
it is also known that gcs may remain relatively preserved to compensate for cardiac function when longitudinal function begins to become impaired in patients with early stage heart failure [ 40 ] .
lv hypertrophy , which is observed even in early stage ckd [ 33 ] , is mainly caused by hypertrophic responses in the mid - myocardial layers that are predominantly circumferentially orientated .
this compensates for the reduction in longitudinal function and may explain preserved lvef and gcs [ 41 ] in our cohort .
lv rotational mechanics are altered with advancing age and various medical conditions such as mi , hypertension , diabetes mellitus and dilated cardiomyopathies [ 42 - 45 ] , however , very little is known about lv twist in ckd .
the lv twists along its long axis during the cardiac cycle as the result of counter clockwise and clockwise rotation of the apex and the base , respectively , in systole and vice versa in diastole [ 46 ] .
this twisting motion or torsion has been attributed to interaction between the epicardial and endocardial helical myocardial fibre couples [ 31 ] .
our group previously identified , for the first time lv twist as a subclinical marker of early renal impairment [ 47 ] , nevertheless in the current study no significant independent association between twist and outcomes was identified .
we found , however , that patients who suffered mace had significantly higher lv twist , supporting the growing evidence that lv rotational mechanics can potentially be used as an early sensitive marker of myocardial disease .
larger outcome studies are required to assess whether this parameter may be useful for prediction of cardiac events in ckd patients. from the conventional echocardiographic parameters , only e / e ' ( average ) was a significant , independent predictor of mace in our cohort .
lv diastolic dysfunction , characterised by abnormalities of ventricular filling , including decreased diastolic distensibility and impaired relaxation , is a very common structural abnormality in patients with ckd [ 48 ] .
e / e ' has been considered a robust marker in the prediction of lv filling pressure in a variety of conditions [ 49 ] and it has been validated against invasive methods for lv filling pressure assessment [ 50 ] .
our findings are in line with previous studies suggesting that e / e ' ratio , which is elevated in ckd and esrf patients [ 51 ] , predicts mortality and cardiovascular events in ckd patients with diastolic dysfunction [ 52 , 53 ] .
arterial remodelling is known to be present even in the early stages of ckd .
compared with normotensive and hypertensive controls , patients with ckd stages 2 - 5 had significantly larger internal carotid artery diameters but comparable intima - media thickness , resulting in significantly increased circumferential wall stress [ 54 ] .
when it comes to cv events , our study complements the findings of the nephrotest study [ 55 ] regarding the important relationship between apwv and all cause mortality and non - fatal cv events in ckd .
they identified apwv as an independent predictor of all - cause mortality and fatal or non - fatal cv events in 439 patients with ckd stages 3 - 5 .
however , 28 % of their population had a history of cv disease .
the present study further extends these findings in a cohort with no clinical evidence of cvd .
in our study , patients with an apwv of 10.2 m / s or more had reduced estimated mace free survival at median follow up of 49 months ( 57.8 % vs. 91.4 % , plog rank = 0.019 ) .
we also aimed to perform a sub analysis to assess predictors of outcome in patients with early ( stages 1 - 3 ) versus advanced ( stages 4,5 ) ckd .
a few authors already established that cardiac and arterial changes start to develop early in the uremic milieu [ 14 , 56 ] .
in our paper , however , the absence of significant predictors of outcome in ckd stages 1 - 3 can be explained by the low number of outcomes in this sub - group when compared with ckd stages 4 - 5 ( 7.5 % vs. 17 % , plog rank = 0.001 ) .
nevertheless , in ckd stages 4 - 5 , we found that apwv is the most robust parameter to predict mace in our cohort , which is in line with previous research [ 55 ] .
in statistical terms , gls was not a significant predictor in either group .
larger outcome studies are necessary to study the value of gls within ckd groups .
the current study presents a number of strengths .
it includes a comprehensive assessment of subclinical myocardial and vascular parameters in an asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view ckd cohort with a long follow - up period ( 49 +/ - 9 months ) .
however the results of this study may require careful interpretation due to some limitations .
( 1 ) although ste measurements as strain or lv twist have been validated against sonomicrometry and cmr , vendor reproducibility [ 57 ] , the need for optimal image quality and time constraint are currently limiting ste use in routine clinical practice ; ( 2 ) the presence of significant coronary epicardial artery disease was not ruled in all patients .
all patients' from our cohort were clinically asymptomatic with normal lvef and no regional wall motion abnormalities by conventional echocardiography .
therefore they did not fulfill the criteria to be subjected to any invasive ( coronary angiography ) or functional testing .
however , within our cohort in a subset of 20 pre - dialysis patients who underwent elective invasive angiography as part of their pre - transplant assessment ( following recruitment to our study ) , the vast majority of patients ( n = 19 ) had no significant disease in their epicardial arteries .
additionally , 12 additional cdk stage 4 - 5 patients had a dobutamine stress echocardiogram as part of their pre transplant assessment .
eleven patients had a negative test for ischaemia and 1 patient had blunted chronothropic response and thus did not achieve 85 % of maximal predicted heart rate despite the use of atropine. from a total 32 patients that underwent functional / invasive testing to exclude the presence of significant coronary / myocardial disease , 30 ( 94 %) had no significant epicardial disease / myocardial ischemia .
this fact supports the hypothesis that microvascular ischaemia may account for the gls patterns observed in the current ckd population .
interesting to notice that despite the absence of myocardial ischaemia and normal epicardial arteries 7 of these patients suffered mace .
this is line with current literature that suggests that non - traditional risk factors - - such as inflammation , oxidative stress , and elevated lipoprotein levels - - have been shown to have a role in promoting cvd risk [ 58 , 59 ] .
( 3 ) even though we adjusted for a large number of patient characteristics , the possibility of residual confounding effects cannot be excluded .
conclusion in ckd patients with no clinical or conventional echocardiographic evidence of significant cvd , gls and apwv independently predict the occurrence of mace .
if our findings are validated in larger prospective studies , gls and apwv may become a useful addition to the current risk stratification tools , aiming to prevent future cardiovascular events in this high - risk patient cohort .

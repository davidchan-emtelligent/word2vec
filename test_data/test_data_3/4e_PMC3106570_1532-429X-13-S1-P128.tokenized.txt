regadenoson is a new , selective adenosine - 2a receptor agonist used for myocardial perfusion imaging .
the purpose of this study was to assess how well rest perfusion imaging 20 minutes after regadenoson stress reflects true baseline rest perfusion .
hypothesis " rest perfusion " performed 20 minutes after regadenoson stress and reversal with aminophylline is higher than rest perfusion before administration of regadenoson .
methods seventeen healthy normal volunteers with framingham score less than 1 % underwent vasodilator stress testing with regadenoson using a ssfp sequence .
rest imaging ( rest 1 ) was performed initially .
twenty minutes later , regadenoson 400mcg was administered as a 10 second injection with saline flush .
stress imaging was done 70 seconds after the injection .
all volunteers received aminophylline 100mg .
a second rest perfusion ( rest 2 ) imaging was done 20 minutes later .
myocardial blood flow ( mbf ) in ml / min / g and myocardial perfusion reserve ( mpr ) were quantified using a fully quantitative model constrained deconvolution ( mcd ) .
results rest 2 mbf ( mean +/ - standard error ) done 20 minutes after regadenoson stress was 1.43 +/ - 0.10 , higher than rest perfusion done before regadenoson administration ( rest 1 ) is 1.18 +/ - 0.07 , p =. 009 .
the stress mbf is 3.72 +/ - 0.18 .
using the rest perfusion after regadenoson as true resting perfusion , leads to a 15 % underestimation of mpr ( 2.75 +/ - 0.21 stress / rest 2 vs. 3.33 +/ - 0.22 stress / rest1 , p = 0.005 ) .
figures 1 and 2 .
figure 1 study design figure 2 rest 1 , stress and rest 2 mbf conclusions rest perfusion done 20 minutes after regadenoson 400 mcg has not returned to baseline resting myocardial perfusion despite reversal with 100mg of aminophylline .
this leads to underestimation of mpr .
regadenoson has a longer duration of effect which might be less suitable for rest perfusion done 20 minutes after stress .

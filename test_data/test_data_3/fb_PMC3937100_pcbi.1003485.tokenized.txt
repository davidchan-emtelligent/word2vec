introduction do you have a difficult problem to solve ? are you writing a grant proposal involving several stakeholders ?
do you want to gather user feedback on a resource , tool , or service ? or perhaps you need to improve a process or way of working in a team ?
to address problems such as these , we recommend holding an interactive workshop .
we find that the dynamic nature of such workshops encourages creative thought and can quickly yield ideas and solutions [ 1 ] .
our ten simple rules aim to empower you to design and lead your own successful interactive workshops .
we define an " interactive workshop " as a structured set of facilitated activities for groups of participants who work together to explore a problem and its solutions , over a specific period of time , in one location .
participants can be users , potential users , team members , customers , or stakeholders .
figure 1 shows a typical layout ; note if you have five or fewer participants , consider having just one group .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1003485.g001 figure 1 example room layout for an interactive workshop .
this bird 's - eye view shows the setup for supporting group - based , facilitated activities around a specific topic , problem , or project .
the moderator oversees the workshop with the help of facilitators , who are briefed in the aims and methods of the activities .
alternatives include " circuit training " layout , where each table is an activity station and the participants move around the room .
an interactive workshop is distinct from a standard meeting because it aims to stimulate creativity through collaborative working .
a meeting , in contrast , usually involves planning and reporting work with attendees sharing their individual points ; it does not involve group activities " live " in the meeting .
also , meetings may be an hour or less , whereas the minimum time needed for an interactive workshop is 2 - 3 hours .
we also do not include training workshops , talks , or seminars in our definition , because from our experience they tend to comprise lectures and tutorials , not brainstorming activities .
however , it could be possible to have an interactive workshop session as part of a longer training course .
rule 1 : decide whether an interactive workshop is the right choice interactive workshops can be useful in many situations , with both internal and external participants ; see [ 2 ] for an example case study .
interactive workshops may be suitable for : gathering ideas for research grant proposals ; ascertaining user requirements for bioinformatics services ; generating ideas for designing web / software interfaces ; solving problems , such as process improvement or work strategies ; deciding priorities , strategy , and vision ; improving working relationships through team building , such as part of retreats .
before you start planning , it is important to determine whether an interactive workshop is the right choice .
for instance , they are not usually advisable at the inception of a project when you need to identify the goals .
organisation leadership , policy , and many other factors may determine this .
however , once objectives have been identified and agreed upon , then an interactive workshop can be valuable to explore how to meet them .
interactive workshops are also unsuitable when you have firm alternatives to evaluate ( like mock - ups for a website ) .
it would be better to get individual feedback and then collate the results .
another consideration is that interactive workshops can require extra time and resources to plan and deliver because activities , templates , and materials need to be prepared in advance and more people may be required for facilitating the activities .
we suggest if there are significant constraints , especially short timescales , it may be more appropriate to hold a standard - format meeting [ 3 ] .
rule 2 : choose participants carefully descriptions of your target groups ( or " user profiles " [ 4 ]) may help guide your choice of participants for an interactive workshop .
aim for diversity in experience , opinions , seniority , and interests .
for external participants , send out an electronic " screener " survey to find out if they truly represent your target profiles and use this information to assign groups for the activities .
you may wish to split colleagues into different groups because separating people who usually work together exposes them to alternative perspectives and new thinking , thus stimulating creativity .
if you are not able to choose the participants yourself , you will still need to find out who they are and see how their perspective and / or background fits with the objective ( s ) of the workshop .
consequently , you may need to factor this into your analysis of the outcomes .
rule 3 : identify suitable activities before you start planning , think about how you ( as the person managing the delivery of the interactive workshop ) will present the outcomes in a talk or report .
consider : what are the tangible aims of the workshop ?
what specific information do you need to capture ?
tailor the activities to these specific goals .
where possible , use engaging activities , such as " game - storming " techniques [ 5 ] , to motivate your participants. by using visual metaphors and games you may further encourage creative thought , as this allows the rules of everyday life to be suspended for exploring problems in new , sometimes unorthodox , ways .
some participants may be sceptical about the value of " just playing games. " however , once you clearly explain the aim of each activity and how it is tailored to solve the problem , most participants will engage positively .
for a checklist of how to introduce an activity to a group , see [ 6 ] .
rule 4 : identify facilitators and brief them facilitators coordinate and assist group discussions and activities during an interactive workshop .
you will need to carefully brief these helpers to ensure they know how to moderate and are familiar with the aims and practicalities of the activities that are scheduled .
you may also wish to have an overseeing moderator who presents the aims , agenda , and activity instructions ( figure 1 ) .
most importantly , you should emphasise that facilitators need to be impartial coordinators : neither contributing ideas , nor evaluating them , but rather encouraging input from participants in their group .
they keep discussions on time , and remind participants to note down all their points , sometimes actually doing this for them whilst they are speaking .
facilitators may also note further ideas onto the artefacts as they arise during the presenting - back phase and subsequent discussion with everyone in the room .
it is not essential for facilitators to have substantial domain expertise , but it may be helpful for them to have at least a basic understanding of the concepts being explored .
for example , for activities to prioritise items it helps if facilitators can clarify what the items are if participants have questions , or give specific examples as illustrations if needed .
on the day of the workshop , the facilitators ( or moderator ) will monitor the groups and , if there is time , they may consider reshuffling them during the breaks , as this can boost creativity .
rule 5 : consider logistics , facilities , and how to record outcomes in advance , arrange to view the room that you will be using for the interactive workshop .
the physical space ( s ) and equipment will influence the activities you run .
find out : are there flip charts or blank walls for recording your participants' ideas ?
if not , do you need to order equipment such as foam boards ?
can you rearrange the tables into small groups , or are there additional rooms available ? is there audio - visual equipment , such as microphones for giving activity instructions ? is there a projector for electronic presentations of the activity instructions and templates ? are there areas for circulating during breaks ?
can you arrange refreshments and / or catering ?
the groups' outputs are called " artefacts " ( see figure 2 and http :// www.youtube.com / watch ? v = xwvbcioyvdm for an example ) .
artefacts could be whiteboards , flip - chart paper sheets , drawings and / or sketches , canvasses ( such as for the " canvas sort " activity in [ 2 ]) , or 3d objects ( such as boxes , as in the " design the box " activity in [ 5 ]) .
it is wise to take photographs of all artefacts on the day ; we have found that paper is easily lost !
recording video summaries of the groups presenting back may also help clarify the information captured .
note that you will need to obtain consent from participants for video footage or photographs .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1003485.g002 figure 2 example of a workshop artefact : the output of the " speed boat " activity .
the aim of this activity is to identify improvements that need to be made , for instance , to a product or service .
the boat and anchors are drawn on paper as a template before the workshop .
during the activity , the groups add their ideas in pen : they write the goal of the workshop on the boat and the challenges to achieving this goal by the anchors .
we also include " positive forces for change " - - things that are moving the project towards the goal - - as " wind arrows " flanking the boat .
the sticky notes have been added after the activity by the facilitator during the presenting - back stage and group discussion .
the sticky notes have been labelled with the letters a to e for reference ; note that a labelling scheme may be helpful for the analysis and report .
this activity was adapted from p .
206 in [ 5 ] ; also watch this video for more hints : http :// www.youtube.com / watch ? v = xwvbcioyvdm. from our experience , interactive workshops are not suitable for remote participation , such as via webcasting , because the collaborative aspects of the group work cannot be easily shared remotely .
if input from participants in distinct locations is necessary , consider running multiple smaller interactive workshops in different places .
rule 6 : plan the agenda you will need a minimum of 2 - 3 hours to run an interactive workshop but , ideally , a full day .
for external participants , also consider the impact of travel arrangements on timing .
ensure the agenda balances different types of activities , such as individual , paired , and collective tasks .
start with a hands - on activity as soon as possible and keep electronic - based presentations to a minimum - - these can sap the creative atmosphere .
bear in mind the phases of a creative workshop : " opening " ( generating ideas ) , " exploring " ( experimenting with the ideas , finding patterns ) , and " closing " ( evaluating , deciding , and listing actions ) [ 5 ] .
to conclude each activity , ensure you schedule enough time for presenting back to the group and discussing outcomes of each activity .
this shows participants that their feedback and participation matters , and it provides an opportunity for clarification .
where possible , we use visual agendas because they set the participants' expectations of the day and prepare them for the interactive nature of the workshop ( figure 3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pcbi.1003485.g003 figure 3 example of a visual agenda .
this was created for an internal workshop held to gather ideas for a website redesign process .
visual agendas are useful for setting the creative tone needed for successful interactive workshops .
interactive workshops can be demanding .
to maintain energy levels , plan breaks , provide refreshments , and aim to finish early .
you may need to schedule the high priority activities earlier in the day in case enthusiasm wanes as you proceed .
alternatively , if you have participants who have travelled long distances and / or from different time zones , schedule the most important activity for later in the day .
remember : planning is important , but you will need to be flexible with the timing on the day , for instance , if an activity is completed early or it overruns .
rule 7 : market your interactive workshop as a networking opportunity networking is a great way to incentivise participation in a workshop with external candidates .
send named invitations and advertise the other organisations that will be present .
you may wish to encourage the participants to network after the event by sharing their contact details .
this can also be a useful contact list for your own future events .
remember to always get consent for how you intend to use contact information .
to encourage socialising at the interactive workshop , consider using games such as the " low - tech social network " or " show and tell " [ 5 ] .
we also recommend using name badges .
rule 8 : get the best from your participants as an interactive workshop leader , you need to encourage people to work together in a short space of time .
we recommend displaying a table plan near the entrance to help participants settle quickly .
we also try to give the groups amusing names to help set the creative tone and / or workshop theme .
get the participants to introduce themselves , for example , by saying where they work , what they do , and why they chose to attend .
this can be done for the whole room or group by group if it is a very large workshop .
we find it is important for participants to know who is in the room before they will be comfortable sharing their ideas .
after this , use " warm - up " and / or " ice - breaker " activities to stimulate collaborative working ; for ideas , see [ 7 ] .
for some activities , you may wish to have an example artefact pre - prepared , perhaps using a " toy " example .
this can be more instructive than a list of instructions .
also have a template prepared for recording a synthesis of the presenting back ( figure 1 ) .
reflective personality types may find " on the spot " thinking uncomfortable [ 8 ] , so provide information about the workshop aims in advance to help them prepare .
on the day , using what we call a " creative silence " approach , where participants brainstorm ideas on sticky notes individually before sharing with the group , can help generate ideas and ensure that everyone participates .
if you have an international audience or diverse disciplines represented at your interactive workshop , you may need to do some background research .
for example , some cultures have a tendency to be more reserved , whilst others may " warm up " quickly and may even need " cool down " activities to get the best results .
we find that details get noticed by the participants , so having creatively designed placeholders , good quality refreshments , a tidy and bright room , etc .
make for a positive experience .
the participants usually appreciate this and will in turn give more energy to taking part in the activities .
rule 9 : follow up with your facilitators and create a post - workshop report immediately after the interactive workshop , ask your facilitators for their top three findings on the outcomes , and their main feedback on how the workshop went as a whole .
it is best to do this face - to - face , so that you can reach a consensus quickly ( because you will all be tired !) .
at the planning stage , schedule a meeting to do a more comprehensive analysis of the findings the day after the workshop .
during the analysis you will need to synthesise and summarise the information on the artefacts .
you will probably need to present these outcomes in a report for whoever requested ( and / or funded ) the workshop .
the executive summary is key because it highlights the main findings .
we also suggest including the methods used for each game so that the reader can see how your results were gathered .
include quotes from participants to emphasise the results .
present your findings visually wherever possible - - for instance , use graphs , charts , and photographs .
highlight any patterns that you identify and consensus from the delegates ( e.g. , " 80 % chose a , 20 % chose b ") .
rule 10 : follow up with your participants ask for feedback on the interactive workshop format : this is the best way to learn what works , and it shows your participants that you value their input .
it is easiest if you can get the participants to fill out a short survey , ideally in the final coffee break so they complete it before they leave .
alternatively , you could send a thank you note to each participant with a link to a short electronic survey .
if the workshop was with stakeholders in a project ( as opposed to users ) , then you may wish to share a report of the findings and a list of actions .
it is important to do this soon after the event to maintain momentum .
to strengthen the collaborations made with external participants , we have often arranged talks and outreach events at their institutes .
often the initial workshop gives us an insight into their requirements , which allows us to tailor activities to their needs .
additionally , you may wish to contact participants for future projects ( if you have obtained their consent for this ) .
for instance , we ran a user - experience - based interactive workshop for a european bioinformatics institute ( ebi ) service , and once we had developed our ideas further , we invited the participants back to take part in usability testing of mock - ups of interface designs .
we also asked if their colleagues would like to take part .
this led to a day of testing with new participants and resulted in new collaborations .
networking with the participants is a good way to find opportunities for outreach , collaboration and future interactive workshops .

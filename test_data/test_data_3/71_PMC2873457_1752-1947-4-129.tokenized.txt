introduction mucinous cystadenoma is a type of mucocele of the appendix that is rarely encountered in clinical practice .
dogmatic consensus on the optimal surgical modus operandi of appendicular mucocele is lacking in the literature and this remains a subject of controversy .
there is little agreement with regard to the best procedure ( right hemicolectomy versus appendectomy ) or the best surgical approach ( laparoscopic versus laparotomy ) .
case presentation we report the case of a 70 - year - old asian woman from karachi who presented with pain in the right iliac fossa for 15 days .
on physical examination , a mobile and firm mass was palpable in the right iliac fossa .
a colonoscopy was performed which showed external compression of the cecum .
a biopsy of the mucosa was normal .
computed tomography scan showed a mucocele of the appendix with minimal periappendiceal fat stranding .
she underwent an initial diagnostic laparoscopy to evaluate any mucin spillage in the peritoneal cavity .
once no spillage was identified , an open appendectomy was then performed .
intra - operatively , a frozen section of the appendiceal sample was sent to ascertain the need for an extension of surgery to a right hemicolectomy .
absence of any malignancy on the frozen section obviated the need for a surgical extension .
the final histopathological examination showed a mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix .
the patient was symptom - free at one year after surgery .
conclusion it is important to distinguish between mucinous cystadenomas and mucinous cystadenocarcinomas .
however , this distinction remains elusive in the pre - operative setting .
a simple appendectomy using an intra - operative frozen section appears to be a reasonable surgical approach for selected cases with an intact mucocele of the appendix .
however , long - term follow - up is warranted in such patients to evaluate the risks of using this approach .
introduction mucinous cystadenoma , a type of appendiceal mucocele , is a rare clinical entity [ 1 ] .
mucoceles of the appendix account for only about 0.3 % of appendix specimens , with mucinous cystadenomas being the most commonly encountered appendiceal mucoceles [ 2 ] .
mucoceles that are less than 2 cm in diameter are usually simple retention cysts , while hyperplastic epithelium , cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma are more likely to be greater than 2 cm [ 3 ] .
in a review of 2660 appendectomy specimens , mucinous cystadenoma was reported in 0.6 % of the cases [ 4 ] .
a consensus on the optimal management of this condition has not yet been reached .
some authors have advocated the use of appendectomy alone for appendicular mucoceles while others support the undertaking of a right hemicolectomy .
we report the case of a 70 - year - old woman who underwent an open appendectomy and was found to have mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix .
in addition , we have also reviewed the indications outlined in the literature for various surgical approaches for appendicular mucoceles .
case presentation a 70 - year - old asian woman from karachi presented with a history of pain in the right iliac fossa ( rif ) for 15 days .
the pain was pricking in nature , moderate in intensity and non - radiating .
she also had a six - month history of a dragging sensation in her lower abdomen .
there was no history of bleeding per rectum or documented weight loss .
she was hemodynamically stable at the time of presentation .
a physical examination showed tenderness and a firm , mobile mass of 5 x 2 cm in the rif .
bowel sounds were audible and rebound tenderness could not be elicited .
her laboratory work - up including complete blood count , serum creatinine and liver function tests were all within normal limits .
she next underwent upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies which revealed an esophageal diverticulum , hiatal hernia , mild chronic helicobacter pylori gastritis and evidence of external compression of the cecum .
the mucosal biopsies from her cecum were reported as benign .
a computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was subsequently obtained which showed a calcified mucocele of the appendix along with multiple calcified mesenteric lymph nodes .
minimal periappendiceal fat infiltration was also seen ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 computed tomography scan showing calcified appendiceal mucocele and calcified mesenteric lymph nodes .
she was electively admitted and an informed consent for appendectomy or possible right hemicolectomy was obtained .
she underwent an initial diagnostic laparoscopy to evaluate any mucin spillage or seeding of the peritoneal cavity before surgical intervention , because any such finding could mandate a more extensive procedure .
once no spillage was identified , we proceeded with open surgery using a limited transverse muscle cutting incision .
the appendix was carefully dissected and removed .
intra - operative findings included an appendicular mass which was most likely a previously perforated appendix along the lateral abdominal wall .
the lateral abdominal wall peritoneum was excised with the appendix to prevent any spillage of appendiceal contents into the abdominal cavity .
the base of the appendix was fixed using absorbable transfixation sutures .
the frozen section of this mass showed extensive foci of dystrophic calcification and non - specific acute and chronic inflammation .
a detailed histopathology report of the appendix along with the attached mesoappendix showed a 1.5 cm perforation in the lumen of the appendix with mucopurulent exudate in the surrounding area .
mucinous material was observed in the dilated appendicular lumen .
tall columnar , hyperplastic mucosa with focal papillary architecture lining the appendix was identified .
foci of dystrophic calcification , extensive areas of fibrosis and patchy acute and chronic non - specific inflammation were also seen in the wall of the appendix .
no significant cytological atypia or invasion of the appendiceal wall by atypical glands was noted ( figures 2 and 3 ) .
a final histopathological diagnosis of mucinous cystadenoma was made .
the patient remained well post - operatively and was discharged after an uneventful hospital stay .
at one - year follow - up , the patient was symptom - free .

figure 3 the same field under a higher magnification of 20 x 10 ( hematoxylin and eosin stain ) .
there are no significant epithelial atypia and no invasion into the deeper tissue .
discussion mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix can be asymptomatic or may present with abdominal pain , an abdominal mass , per rectal bleeding , ureteral obstruction , hematuria or intussusception [ 1,5 - 8 ] .
our patient had a 15 - day history of pain in her rif .
she had also been experiencing some heaviness in the lower abdomen for six months .
although the presence of symptoms in a patient with an appendiceal mucocele has been reported to be associated with a higher incidence of cystadenocarcinomas [ 9 ] , this does not appear to be a useful guide in the pre - operative assessment of patients with appendiceal mucoceles .
colonoscopy and ct scan were used as the initial investigative modalities in our patient .
ct scan findings in patients with mucinous cystadenomas include cystic masses with low attenuation , irregular wall thickening and absence of associated appendiceal inflammation [ 1,7 ] .
mural calcification has been reported with a high frequency ( 50 %) in patients with appendicular mucinous cystadenomas [ 10 ] .
it is also important to note that the varying thickness of the wall of the mass on ct scans has not been shown to correlate with malignancy .
however , contrast enhancing nodules on ct scans may be suggestive of cystadenocarcinomas [ 1 ] .
a colonoscopy performed on our patient revealed external compression of the cecum with normal overlying mucosa .
we then proceeded with a ct scan which showed an appendicular mucocele with extensive mural calcification and some periappendiceal stranding .
both mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas have the potential to cause peritoneal seeding leading to pseudomyxoma peritonei .
however , survival in patients with a cystadenoma is better compared to patients with its malignant counterpart when considering pseudomyxoma peritonei [ 1,11,12 ] .
it is important to distinguish between mucinous cystadenomas and mucinous cystadenocarcinomas .
however , this distinction remains elusive and cannot be established with any degree of reliability if we are to depend solely on physical examination findings and radiological imagings .
histopathological examination is instrumental in achieving an accurate diagnosis .
herein , lies the dilemma for the surgeon because of the nebulous nature of the distinction between these entities in the pre - operative setting .
the best surgical management of a patient with an appendiceal mucocele remains a subject of controversy .
there is little consensus on the optimal choice of procedure ( right hemicolectomy versus appendectomy ) as well as the approach ( laparoscopic versus laparotomy ) .
while earlier data have shown a survival advantage associated with right hemicolectomy , more recent prospective data findings do not report any survival advantages in a patient with pseudomyxoma peritonei syndrome and appendiceal mucinous carcinomatosis undergoing a right hemicolectomy [ 13 - 15 ] .
in general , certain principles must be kept in mind while operating on patients with appendiceal mucoceles .
it is important to exercise care in handling tissues intra - operatively to reduce the risk of dissemination of mucin - producing epithelium [ 1 ] .
zagrodnik et al. have supported the choice for appendectomy with mesoappendix excision in the absence of local invasion or cecal involvement for appendiceal masses [ 1 ] .
gupta et al. have advocated the removal of mucoceles of less than 2 cm in diameter using this approach [ 7 ] .
however , mucoceles of less than 2 cm in diameter are usually simple retention cysts and this choice of surgical approach based on size alone does not appear to be helpful considering that hyperplastic epithelium , cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma are more likely to be greater than 2 cm in size [ 3 ] .
the presence of local invasion and cecal involvement are two indications in the literature that necessitate employment of right hemicolectomy for appendiceal mucoceles [ 1 ] .
an open approach has been favored by some authors as being a definitive and safe maneuver which allows better visualization of the abdominal cavity .
this advocacy is supported by the incidence of peritoneal implants and inadvertently missed lesions after laparoscopy [ 1,9 ] .
the right retrohepatic space , pelvis , omentum and left paracolic space all merit meticulous inspection for mucinous fluid collection .
the appendiceal lymph nodes and appendiceal stump should also be carefully inspected [ 9 ] .
conclusion it would be prudent for surgeons to exercise clinical acumen in choosing the best procedure for patients in the absence of unequivocally reproducible prospective data .
we want to highlight the value of using frozen sections in the surgical management for patients with appendicular mucoceles .
this is a reasonable intra - operative approach to pursue in selected cases whereby the operation can be extended to include a right hemicolectomy if the findings so warrant .
lymph node status and margin positivity can serve as useful guides in this regard [ 9 ] .
our patient was symptom - free at one - year follow - up. long - term follow - up of our patient will help to ascertain the safety profile of the approach we employed .
systematic work - up and follow - up of patients with mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix should be undertaken because of the reported association with ovarian mucinous cystoma and large bowel adenocarcinoma [ 6,8 ] .

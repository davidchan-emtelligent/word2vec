abstract we report a rare case of emphysematous cystitis in a 66 - year - old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus .
the predisposition of diabetes mellitus and infection of gas - forming bacteria is considered to precede the manifestation of emphysematous cystitis .
the present recommended diagnosis test is computed tomography , which have definite value in the evaluation of gas accumulation in bladder wall , or an air - fluid level in bladder .
keywords : cystitis tomography x - ray computed diabetes mellitus introduction a 66 - year - old woman with a 10 - year history of diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department for painful urination and gross hematuria .
similar episodes had occurred several times in the 6 months preceding presentation , along with episodes of acute urinary retention and bladder catheterization .
the physical examination was unremarkable .
laboratory investigations revealed mild anemia ( hb : 9.2g / dl ) and elevated blood glucose ( bg : 171mg / dl ) .
urinalysis findings indicated urinary tract infection .
the culture of voided midstream urine showed evidence of escherichia coli .
urinary system ultrasonography revealed an irregular thickened bladder wall with post - void residual volume of 140ml .
computed tomography ( ct ) of the abdomen and pelvis without administration of contrast material revealed diffuse gas within the bladder wall ( figure - 1 ) and a prominent air - fluid level ( figure - 2 ) .
this pattern of gas surrounding the urinary bladder on computed tomography is a typical manifestation of emphysematous cystitis ( ec ) in which natural fermentation of glucose for gas - forming bacteria infected mostly in diabetic women ( 1 , 2 ) .
figure 1 gas surround the bladder wall on computed tomography .
figure 2 a prominent air - fluid level within the bladder on computed tomography .
ec is a rare , but severe infection of the bladder characterized by gas accumulation surrounding the bladder wall .
it occurs predominantly in females over 60 years old , with 60 - 70 % of cases being diabetic patients ( 1 ) .
diabetes mellitus and female gender are the highest risks for developing ec. the typical presentation spectrum of ec includes lower abdominal pain , bacteremia , and dysuria .
urinalysis often indicates bacteriuria , pyuria and hematuria .
ct is the most sensitive diagnostic protocol for ec ( 3 ) .
current concepts about the pathogenesis of gas formation in the bladder is postulated that bacteria such as escherichia coli .
ferment the glucose in the urine of diabetic patients but in non - diabetic patients remains still unknown .
ec is often successfully managed with drainage and appropriate antibiotics .
about 10 % of cases require surgery and estimated mortality rate is 7 % ( 4 , 5 ) .
our patient was treated with levofloxacin 500mg for 5 days and was discharged in stable condition .

background the family is an important social context where children learn and adopt eating behaviors .
specifically , parents play the role of health promoters , role models , and educators in the lives of children , influencing their food cognitions and choices .
this study attempts to systematically review empirical studies examining the influence of parents on child food consumption behavior in two contexts : one promotive in nature ( e.g. , healthy food ) , and the other preventive in nature ( e.g. , unhealthy food ) .
methods from a total of 6,448 titles extracted from web of science , eric , psycinfo and pubmed , seventy eight studies met the inclusion criteria for a systematic review , while thirty seven articles contained requisite statistical information for meta - analysis .
the parental variables extracted include active guidance / education , restrictive guidance / rule - making , availability , accessibility , modeling , pressure to eat , rewarding food consumption , rewarding with verbal praise , and using food as reward .
the food consumption behaviors examined include fruits and vegetables consumption , sugar - sweetened beverages , and snack consumption .
results results indicate that availability ( healthy : r = . 24 , p < . 001 ; unhealthy : r = . 34 , p < . 001 ) and parental modeling effects ( healthy : r = . 32 , p < . 001 ; unhealthy : r = . 35 , p < . 001 ) show the strongest associations with both healthy and unhealthy food consumption .
in addition , the efficacy of some parenting practices might be dependent on the food consumption context and the age of the child .
for healthy foods , active guidance / education might be more effective ( r = . 15 , p < . 001 ) .
for unhealthy foods , restrictive guidance / rule - making might be more effective ( r = - . 11 , p < . 01 ) .
for children 7 and older , restrictive guidance / rule - making could be more effective in preventing unhealthy eating ( r = - . 20 , p < . 05 ) .
for children 6 and younger , rewarding with verbal praise can be more effective in promoting healthy eating ( r = . 26 , p < . 001 ) and in preventing unhealthy eating ( r = - . 08 , p < . 01 ) .
conclusions this study illustrates that a number of parental behaviors are strong correlates of child food consumption behavior .
more importantly , this study highlights 3 main areas in parental influence of child food consumption that are understudied : ( 1 ) active guidance / education , ( 2 ) psychosocial mediators , and ( 3 ) moderating influence of general parenting styles .

keywords parent child nutrition food eating fruits vegetables sugar healthy unhealthy consumption issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background food consumption preferences are developed early in life [ 1 ] .
understanding how children 's food consumption choices are developed has the potential to benefit individuals' health over their entire lifetime .
specifically , limiting the consumption of sugar - sweetened beverages ( ssbs ) , while increasing the consumption of healthy food choices such as fruits and vegetables , can have protective effects on people 's health [ 2 , 3 ] .
in spite of this , children across several parts of the world are consuming sugars at an alarming rate , with children in the united states [ 4 , 5 ] , united kingdom [ 6 ] , mexico [ 7 ] , and even asian countries such as taiwan and singapore [ 8 - 10 ] consuming ssbs at worrying levels .
to compound the problem of sugar consumption on their diets , the consumption of fruits and vegetables among children is relatively low across the world .
in the united states , 60 % of children do not consume enough fruits to meet the recommended daily guidelines , while 93 % of children do not consume sufficient vegetables [ 11 ] .
mirroring the united states , european children are consuming fruits and vegetables below the recommended levels [ 12 ] .
parents are important socialization agents who play the role of health promoters , role models , and educators in the lives of their children [ 13 ] .
defined as " processes whereby naive individuals are taught the skills , behavior patterns , values , and motivations needed for competent functioning ( p.13 )" , socialization in the context of food consumption involves parents conveying learning outcomes such as norms , knowledge , attitudes and behaviors to children via a range of behaviors [ 14 ] .
among socialization researchers , two broad concepts have been used to understand parental influence on child outcomes [ 15 ] .
first , parental practices are context - specific strategies parents use to help children achieve socialization goals .
second , general parenting style , which cuts across behavioral contexts , refers to the general emotional climate in which these parental practices are situated .
currently , there are no comprehensive systematic reviews surveying the influence of parental practices and parenting styles on child ssbs and fruits and vegetables consumption .
existing reviews have either focused on examining a broad array of determinants of ssbs consumption without an in - depth examination of the role of parents [ 16 , 17 ] , or examined the influence of singular parental practices - such as availability and role modelling - on various child food consumption behavior [ 18 , 19 ] .
reviews that have focused on parental influence have examined parental practices in only one specific food consumption outcome , namely fruits and vegetables consumption , and these reviews tend not to quantitatively summarize the effect sizes between the parenting variables and child food consumption outcomes [ 20 , 21 ] .
there are currently no meta - analytic studies that aim to provide a quantitative summary of the influence of various parenting variables on child food consumption behavior .
to our knowledge , this study would be the first to systematically review the influence of parents in two areas of child food consumption , one promotive ( fruits and vegetables consumption ) and one preventive ( ssbs consumption ) .
examining the influence of parents in these two areas of child food consumption behaviors can help provide greater clarity of the efficacy of certain parental practices in different contexts .
this paper addresses these gaps in the literature by presenting the results from a comprehensive systematic review and meta - analysis of studies designed to examine the relationship between parental factors ( which includes both context - specific parental practices and more general parenting styles ) and child food consumption behaviors ( ssbs and fruits and vegetables consumption ) .
it attempts to cover a wide spectrum of parental factors believed to shape child food consumption , and examine their influence in two food consumption contexts - one preventive in nature ( ssbs consumption ) and one promotive in nature ( fruits and vegetables consumption ) .
methods the review was conducted in two phases .
first , an extensive systematic review of the literature was done to identify the parental factors related to child food consumption behavior .
next , a meta - analysis was conducted following these classifications , with studies which contain the requisite statistical information .
literature search in order to find relevant studies of parenting effects on child food cognitions , choice , and intake , a literature search was conducted in the following major databases : web of science , psycinfo , eric , and pubmed .
the search strategy relied on using a combination of parental factors keywords and child food consumption keywords .
parental factors keywords were matched with a child food consumption keyword for every search .
the parental factor keywords were : " parenting " , " parent * communication " , " parent * strateg *" , " parent * style *" , " parent * practice *" , " parent * feed * strateg *" , and " parent * feed * practice *" .
the keywords for child food consumption were : " eating " , " food consumption " , " soft drink *" , " sweetened beverage *" , " fruit *" , and " vegetable *" .
to ensure comprehensiveness , the reference lists of key articles were hand searched to identify literature not retrieved from the initial search .
an initial search was conducted in december 2015 .
the list of studies was updated with a second round of search in march 2016 .
inclusion and exclusion criteria an article had to fulfill the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion : ( 1 ) the subjects of study had to be healthy children or adolescents below the age of 18 ; ( 2 ) the studies had to utilize quantitative methods ( surveys and experiments were both included ) , with statistical significance being reported ; ( 3 ) the independent variable ( s ) must contain one parenting practice or style ; ( 4 ) the dependent variable ( s ) were either food cognitions such as attitudes ( implicit and explicit ) , liking , preference or social norms , or food consumption choice and / or intake of fruits and vegetables or ssbs .
articles that were excluded were : ( 1 ) articles not published in english ; ( 2 ) studies that involved only overweight or obese parents and / or children ; ( 3 ) studies that stratified analyses according to bmi without providing overall effect sizes ; ( 4 ) studies that examined the dependent variable ( s ) of eating problems and styles such as eating disorders , disordered eating , and emotional eating , as well as bmi ; and ( 5 ) intervention studies .
analytical approach in the first phase , a three - step process was utilized to identify relevant studies for the systematic review .
first , the retrieved papers were screened and shortlisted using their titles .
next , the abstracts of the shortlisted articles were screened in another round of shortlisting .
two reviewers were involved in shortlisting the articles .
overall , percent agreement between the reviewers were at 92 % .
all disagreements were discussed between the reviewers and resolved by revisiting the inclusion / exclusion criteria and by coming to a consensus .
finally , entire articles were retrieved from the database and screened , with eligible studies being retained for the review .
the associations between parenting factors and child eating outcomes were represented with "+" for a significant positive association , " - " for a significant inverse association , and " 0 " for a null association .
associations with a reported p value of < 0.05 were considered significant .
in studies with univariate and multivariate results , the associations considered were taken from the multivariate analysis .
studies with statistical analyses indicating the significance level were included .
mediation and moderation effects are stated in the final column of additional file 1 : table s1 .
in stratifying the analysis according to child age , piaget 's three stages of cognitive development in children was utilized [ 22 ] .
parental factors that saw less than 2 studies conducted within a developmental stage were omitted from the analysis .
as there were no standardized terminologies for parental factors , with researchers often utilizing conflicting definitions with regard to similar terms , we attempted to develop a list of overarching parental constructs by examining each study 's operationalized measurement items .
first , we examined all the measures used across every study .
next , we grouped the measurement items into arbitrarily named parental practice variables based on face validity .
when operationalized measurement items grouped together came from a wide range of differently named constructs ( across different researchers ) , the variable they represent were given a new term in order to avoid confusion ( e.g. , parental encouragement through rationale and parent nutrition teaching were classified under active guidance ) .
on the other hand , when a group of measures representing a variable were derived from a commonly used term , the term was retained ( e.g. , modeling ) .
once all the factors were identified and named , two reviewers classified the measures in each included study based on the identified constructs .
percent agreement between the two reviewers were at 91 % overall .
disagreements were resolved through a discussion between the reviewers .
in the second phase , a meta - analysis was conducted for studies that were eligible for the calculation of effect sizes using the comprehensive meta - analysis 2 software .
in order for studies to be included in the meta - analysis , the quantitative information required for computation of overall effect size , such as sample sizes , means , correlations , odds ratios and test statistics must have been available .
studies without these required information were excluded .
in order to generate overall effect sizes , data from studies that included correlations , means with standard deviations , or odds ratios were converted into pearson 's product - moment correlation scores , resulting in commensurable effect sizes across studies .
the conversions were executed using established formulas [ 23 ] .
studies utilizing spearman correlation coefficients were also included , as spearman correlation coefficients are equivalent or only slightly smaller as compared to pearson 's product - moment correlation scores [ 24 ] .
these correlation coefficients were then weighted according to the corresponding study 's sample size and standard error , resulting in a weighted correlation score [ 25 ] .
following that , the overall effect sizes of each predictor and outcome were calculated by averaging the weighted correlation coefficients across the eligible studies .
as some studies utilized a combination of food items within a single category as dependent variables ( e.g. , fruits and vegetables as separate measures ) , the meta - analysis was conducted by averaging the correlations between an independent variable and the dependent variables within a category , so that only a single correlation score is computed for either healthy or unhealthy food consumption.1 this meta - analysis was conducted using random effects models .
an a priori assumption guided this choice .
since studies included in this analysis were not identical , it was not possible to assume a true effect size across the studies .
the studies were conducted independently across different age groups of children , and across different cultural contexts , indicating that the use of random effects models was more appropriate in the analysis [ 26 ] .
figure 1 displays a prisma flowchart illustrating the systematic process of conducting the review. fig. 1 prisma flow diagram results a total of 6448 titles were located from the literature search ( web of science = 1692 ; eric = 190 ; psycinfo = 708 ; pubmed = 3858 ) .
after removing duplicates , there were a total of 2237 unique titles potentially relevant for inclusion in this review .
after screening the titles , 556 articles were retained for abstract screening .
following that , 158 full - text articles were retrieved and scanned in their entirety for eligibility , with 82 articles being retained for analysis .
six articles were added after hand searching the reference lists of relevant articles , resulting in a total of 88 articles utilized in this review .
a summary of the studies can be viewed in additional file 1 : table s1 .
characteristics of included studies most of the studies were cross - sectional studies ( n = 66 ) , with the rest being longitudinal ( n = 14 ) , experimental ( n = 5 ) , and quasi - experimental ( n = 3 ) .
49 % of the studies involved children in the pre - operational stage ( ages 2 to 6 ; n = 43 ) , 33 % involved those in the concrete operational stage ( ages 7 to 11 ; n = 29 ) , while only 16 % of the studies involved those in the formal operational stage ( ages 12 to 18 ; n = 16 ) 2 [ 22 ] .
most studies were situated in the us , europe , and australia , with the exception of three studies : one being situated in israel , one in costa rica , and another in hong kong .
the spread of parent - report ( n = 33 ) , child - report ( n = 28 ) , and parent - child matched samples ( n = 27 ) were evenly matched .
despite this , most studies with parent - report measures consisted of a large number of female participants. with regard to specific target food items being examined , 64 % of studies examined parental influence on fruits / vegetables consumption ( n = 56 ) , 24 % examined ssbs consumption3 ( n = 21 ) , 51 % examined some form of unhealthy eating4 ( n = 45 ) , and 10 % examined healthy foods consumption5 ( n = 9 ) .
since specific food items ( eg. fruits / vegetables , ssbs ) were measured in the composite measures of general healthy and unhealthy food consumption , the subsequent analysis of the effects of parenting on child food consumption considered them under the concepts of healthy ( promotive ) and unhealthy ( preventive ) food consumption .
a total of 10 parental factors were identified from the literature .
they included context - specific parental practices of restrictive guidance ( or rule - making ) ( n = 48 ) , modeling ( or parents' own food consumption behavior ) ( n = 37 ) , availability ( or the control of availability ) ( n = 36 ) , parental pressure to eat ( n = 25 ) , food as reward ( n = 12 ) , rewarding food consumption ( n = 10 ) , rewarding food consumption with praise ( n = 9 ) , accessibility ( n = 6 ) , and active guidance ( or verbal education and encouragement ) ( n = 5 ) .
meanwhile , the effects of general parenting styles were examined in 18 % of the studies ( n = 16 ) .
context - specific parental practices and child food consumption restrictive guidance restrictive guidance is defined as the frequency with which parents set limits , rules , or restrictions regarding food consumption .
closely related to the parental mediation dimension of restrictive mediation [ 27 ] , this includes a range of overt parental restriction constructs such as rule - making and parental overt control .
among the included studies , 33 examined the relationship between parental restrictive guidance and healthy eating such as fruits and vegetables intake .
amongst these , 13 indicated a positive relationship with healthy eating , three yielded a negative relationship , whilst 17 indicated a non - significant relationship .
for unhealthy eating such as the consumption of ssbs , restrictive guidance was found to reduce consumption in 16 out of 38 studies .
eight studies suggested that parental restrictive guidance is associated with higher consumption of unhealthy foods among children , while 14 studies indicated a null relationship .
this suggests a large amount of heterogeneity in the relationship between restrictive guidance and both healthy and unhealthy child food consumption behaviors .
modeling modeling was measured in two ways across the literature .
first , modeling was measured as parental intake of a target food item .
in such a case , a positive relationship between parent and child intake was indicative of a significant modeling effect .
second , modeling was measured as the frequency in which parents eat healthily and demonstrate the benefits and pleasure of eating healthily in front of children .
in both cases , modeling was consistently found to be associated with child eating .
among the 31 studies that examined modeling and healthy food consumption , 28 found a significant positive relationship , while three saw no significant association .
among the 16 studies that examined modeling and unhealthy food consumption , 13 showed a significant positive association , while three saw no significant association .
this suggests that the effects of parental modeling on child food consumption behavior are homogenous and significant .
parental control of availability parental control of availability simply refers to whether a particular food is available at home .
since children develop food preferences through consistent exposure to foods [ 28 - 30 ] , the availability of food would be crucial in determining whether children develop healthy food preferences rather than energy - dense food preferences such as ssbs .
availability was measured in two ways across the reviewed studies .
first , it was measured with regards to actual availability of a target food item ( this can be measured as availability or non - availability of a target food ) .
second , it was measured as a parental strategy that involves parents controlling the availability of unhealthy foods in a covert manner [ 31 - 33 ] .
among the 27 studies examining availability of healthy foods and healthy foods consumption , an overwhelming 19 studies indicated a positive association , whilst 5 indicated a null relationship .
likewise , availability of healthy food , non - availability of unhealthy foods , as well as parental control of availability of unhealthy foods , were associated with decreased unhealthy eating in 18 out of 22 studies .
three studies indicated a null relationship .
these results suggest that availability or control of food availability can be a consistent predictor of child food consumption .
pressure to eat parents can also pressure children into eating more food [ 34 ] .
this practice refers to parents utilizing verbal communication to try and persuade their children to consume more food .
pressure can manifest in a parent asking his or her child to clean up their plates , even if the child says he or she is not hungry [ 35 ] .
underlying parental pressure to eat is a fear that a child is not consuming enough food .
although parents' intention when utilizing pressure is to encourage sufficient nutrient intake , some researchers have argued that it can have the opposite effect , leading to lower fruits and vegetables intake [ 36 , 37 ]. of the 22 studies that examined pressure to eat and healthy food consumption , 14 showed no significant associations .
six studies found significant negative associations , where pressure was shown to be associated with less healthy food consumption .
only two studies found a positive association. with regards to unhealthy food consumption , eight studies showed that pressuring a child to eat was associated with significantly higher unhealthy food intake , while 13 studies showed that there were no significant associations .
food as reward parents might also utilize food as a reward when children exhibit desirable behavior .
three studies found a negative association between using food as reward and healthy food consumption , with the large majority of studies ( n = 7 ) finding no significant relationships between the two variables .
in contrast , six out of ten studies that examined the influence of food as reward on unhealthy eating found a positive relationship .
as unhealthy foods such as sweet snacks are most often used as the reward item , this practice tends to increase preferences for unhealthy foods [ 38 , 39 ] .
however , less is known about how the utilization of healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables as reward can influence child food consumption outcomes .
rewarding food consumption materially rather than using food as a form of reward , parents can sometimes reward healthy food consumption with material or playtime rewards [ 39 , 40 ] .
according to self - determination theory [ 41 , 42 ] , providing extrinsic rewards for an activity can potentially decrease the motivation and desire to perform the activity .
when a reward is provided for eating a certain food , a child will tend to devalue the instrumental activity performed to receive the reward , as the child will see the activity as a means to an end [ 43 ] .
in other words , if eating healthy food is the only way a child can get to play outside , the child might see it as a chore , and subsequently hold negative mental associations , feelings , and cognitions about the food .
out of 10 studies , most studies ( n = 6 ) found no significant relationships between rewarding food consumption and child healthy eating .
three studies found a positive association , while one study found a negative association .
among the four studies that examined the relationship between rewarding food consumption and unhealthy eating , one study found a positive association .
this positive association could be due to a single item in the composite measure of rewarding food consumption belonging conceptually closer to using food as reward ( e.g. , dessert as contingent upon eating something the child does n't like ) [ 44 ] .
rewarding with praise parents can reward children with praise rather than material or hedonic rewards .
some researchers have suggested that praise is qualitatively different from other types of rewards [ 40 ] , likely because praise fulfills and fosters the intrinsic needs of relatedness , competence , and autonomy , as compared to extrinsic rewards .
among seven studies that examined the relationship of praise with healthy food consumption , four found positive relationships , while three yielded non - significant results. with regards to unhealthy eating , one study found that praise was associated with savory snack consumption among girls only , while the other studies ( n = 4 ) found no significant relationships .
accessibility parental control of food accessibility refers to " whether the foods are prepared , presented , and / or maintained in a form that enables or encourages children to eat them ( p. 26 ) [ 45 ]" .
six studies examined the relationship between making food accessible and child fruits / vegetables intake .
four studies indicated a positive relationship , while two indicated a null relationship , suggesting that accessibility can potentially be a useful parental strategy in encouraging healthy eating .
active guidance active guidance or education is defined as the degree which parents actively discuss , verbally interact , and instruct their child with regards to food .
only five studies examined the influence of active guidance on child food consumption .
in these studies , the measures indicating active guidance were encouragement through rationale ( e.g. , eating vegetables is good for you ) [ 44 ] , or nutritional teaching regarding types of food [ 46 ] .
amongst the studies , one found a positive relationship between active guidance and vegetables consumption , as well as a negative relationship between active guidance and ssbs consumption .
however , the four other studies have indicated a non - significant relationship between active guidance and healthy or unhealthy eating .
general parenting styles and moderation effects parenting researchers recognize that individual context - specific parenting behaviors are a part of a complex milieu of other parenting behaviors , so no individual parenting practice ( eg. such as the use of active guidance ) can be isolated and tested for its influence without considering other facets of parenting [ 15 ] .
in view of this , general styles of parenting can be viewed as a circumstantial construct that would moderate the influence of context - specific parenting behaviors such as active parental guidance , using food as reward , pressuring children to eat and so on [ 47 - 49 ] .
this perspective adopts the view that context - specific parenting practices can have different effects when employed by families who utilize a different parenting style [ 50 ] .
in general , most studies reviewed examined the direct relationship between parenting variables and child food consumption outcomes .
only approximately 10 % ( n = 9 ) of all the articles reviewed examined the moderating influence of general parenting styles , indicating a lack of empirical understanding about the complex influence of parenting styles on the effects of parenting practices .
amongst those that examined parenting styles as a moderator , one noted that restrictive guidance situated in an authoritarian parenting style showed stronger effects on fruits intake , whilst availability situated in an authoritative parenting style showed stronger effects on fruits and vegetables intake [ 51 ] .
another study utilizing parental feeding style as a moderator supported this , as they found that restrictive guidance led to lower intake of low - nutrient - density foods among less permissive parents [ 52 ] .
one study found that restrictive guidance had stronger positive associations with healthy eating , and stronger negative associations with unhealthy eating when parental warmth is high , suggesting that whilst demandingness / control might lead to more effective restrictive guidance , warmth can also play a role in moderating the effects in the same direction [ 53 ] .
another echoed these findings , as they found that restrictive guidance and availability were more strongly associated with lower child ssbs intake amongst children with highly responsive , as well as moderately demanding parents [ 54 ] .
other studies contradicted these findings .
specifically , one study found that children under an indulgent parental feeding style ( low in demandingness , high in responsiveness ) saw greater positive relationship between restrictive guidance and fruits and vegetables consumption [ 49 ] .
likewise , two other studies found that restrictive guidance was associated with lower ssbs intake only when behavioral control was low among parents [ 55 , 56 ] .
other than its moderating effects on restrictive guidance , one study found that the strongest associations between modeling and child fruit consumption occurred among children who were under a highly controlling parenting style [ 55 ] .
another study also found that controlling the availability of food was also more effective in reducing ssbs intake amongst children of parents who reported higher control [ 56 ]. of all nine studies , only one study found no moderating effect from parenting styles [ 57 ] .
cognitive mediators of food consumption five studies sought to examine the influence of parenting on food cognitions such as preference [ 58 ] , liking [ 59 , 60 ] , subjective norms [ 61 ] , desire [ 62 ] , and attitudes [ 57 , 61 ] .
although all five studies indicated some level of significant relationships between parenting variables and food cognitions , mediation through these cognitions were not tested statistically .
only one reviewed study examined potential psycho - social mediators between parenting variables and child food consumption [ 63 ] .
in the study , the researchers found that self - efficacy partially mediated the effects of modeling on fruits and vegetables consumption .
differences by child age eighty - six studies were included in the stratified analysis of studies based on child age .
two studies were omitted as there was insufficient information regarding the mean age of the children being referred to available within the full - text article .
table 1 summarizes the findings of the studies being reviewed , according to child age .
interestingly , some age differences can be observed .

this was in contrast to studies with younger children in the pre - operational stage ( pos ) and concrete operational stage ( cos ) , where a large amount of heterogeneity exists , and with a substantial proportion of studies finding a significant positive relationship ( 40 and 35 % respectively ) .
interestingly , a greater proportion of studies showed that restrictive guidance had a negative relationship with unhealthy food consumption among children in fos ( 83 %) , as compared to those in the cos ( 45 %) and pos ( 29 %) .
unsurprisingly , a greater proportion of studies among older children ( cos compared to pos ) found a positive relationship between active guidance and healthy food consumption , and a negative relationship between active guidance and unhealthy food consumption .
this suggests that active guidance might be more useful in shaping food consumption behaviors with children that are at a more advanced developmental stage .
unfortunately , there were no studies that involved children in the fos for comparisons .
more studies appear to show the undesirable effects of pressuring a child to eat among younger children .
36 % of the studies involving children in pos found a negative relationship with healthy food consumption , while 55 % found a positive relationship with unhealthy food consumption .
however , for samples involving older age groups , a vast majority of studies found no significant relationship between pressuring and both types of food consumption .
rewarding food consumption either with praise or with tangible rewards appear to be more effective in promoting healthy eating among younger children in the pos , with 50 % of the studies finding a positive relationship between rewarding food consumption and healthy food consumption , and 80 % finding a positive relationship between rewarding with praise and healthy food consumption .
however , these significant findings were non - existent among those in the cos .
meta - analysis findings in addition to the preceding systematic review , a smaller subset of 37 studies with available statistics was utilized to conduct a quantitative meta - analysis .
except for the relationship between accessibility and unhealthy food consumption , all relationships had at least two eligible studies , allowing us to compute a meta - analytic effect size for each relationship between variables .
as illustrated in table 2 , five out of the nine parental communication variables had a statistically significant weighted correlation with child healthy food consumption .
specifically , active guidance ( r = . 15 , p < . 001 ) , availability ( r = . 24 , p < . 001 ) , modeling ( r = . 32 , p < . 001 ) , and verbal praise ( r = . 15 , p < . 05 ) were significantly and positively correlated with child healthy food consumption .
the effect sizes were small to medium according to guidelines developed by cohen [ 64 , 65 ] .
in addition , pressuring children to eat had a small but significant negative correlation with child healthy food consumption ( r = - . 04 , p < . 05 ) .
restrictive guidance , accessibility , and rewarding food consumption were not significantly correlated with child healthy food consumption .

specifically , restrictive guidance ( r = - . 11 , p < . 01 ) , and verbal praise ( r = - . 04 , p < . 05 ) had small but significant negative correlations with child unhealthy food consumption .
on the other hand , availability ( r = . 34 , p < . 001 ) , modelling ( r = . 35 , p < . 001 ) , pressure to eat ( r = . 04 , p < . 05 ) , and using food as reward ( r = . 14 , p < . 05 ) were positively correlated with child unhealthy food consumption .
active guidance and rewarding food consumption were not significantly correlated with child unhealthy food consumption .

as such , examining age as a moderator in the analysis could reveal potential differences .
among the nine parental communication variables , active guidance , rewarding food consumption and using food as reward did not have heterogeneous results across study in the context of child healthy food consumption , thus they were excluded from the analysis .
likewise , reward with verbal praise and food as reward were excluded from the analysis in the context of child unhealthy food consumption due to it fulfilling the assumption of homogeneity .
additionally , active guidance was excluded from the analysis as there were only two studies available for moderator analyses .

* p < . 05 , ** p < . 01 , *** p < . 001 the results showed that although availability had a significant positive relationship with healthy food consumption across all age groups , it had a stronger association with healthy food consumption among older children .
however , this ought to be read with caution , as among the fos group , only one study was utilized in the analysis .
echoing the results of the systematic review analyses stratified by child age , the undesirable effects of parental pressuring on healthy food consumption was found only among younger children , and not older children .
likewise , the positive associations between rewarding with verbal praise and healthy food consumption existed only among younger children , and not older children. with regard to unhealthy food consumption , the results indicated that restrictive guidance was more effective in reducing unhealthy food consumption among older children .
in addition , rewarding desirable eating behavior with verbal praise had a negative association with unhealthy food consumption only among younger and not older children .
discussion the systematic review of parental factors and child promotive and preventive food consumption outcomes yielded a total of 10 potential parental factors , 9 of which captured context - specific parental factors , and one of which referred to parenting styles as a moderating factor. of these , availability or the control of availability of food items , along with parental modeling were consistently associated with both desirable and undesirable food consumption cognitions and consumption .
this was supported by both the systematic review and the meta - analysis .
first , meta - analytic procedures found that they had the strongest correlations with both child healthy and unhealthy food consumption .
second , the systematic review found that a vast majority of studies support the direction of relationship as indicated in the meta - analysis .
parents availing food can increase consumption from the possibility that children eat whatever that is available to them .
in addition , parental modeling could possibly convey attitudinal , norms - based , and self - efficacy beliefs to children , which drives consumption behavior [ 67 ] .
according to social cognitive theory , modeling refers to the process whereby an individual ( in this case a child ) learns through his or her observations of another person performing a behavior [ 68 , 69 ] .
specifically , it is hypothesized that a child will imitate or adopt behaviors when they observe an influential role model in their lives ( e.g. , a parent ) perform said behaviors .
modeling effects take place because observations of other people eating will influence their own beliefs about what to eat , and how much is appropriate to eat [ 70 ] .
in addition , some researchers have defined modeling as a type of parental communication strategy , consisting of parental encouragement for their children to adopt their own behaviors intentionally through overt verbal communication and covert non - verbal strategies [ 71 - 73 ] .
specifically , modeling can also occur when parents explicitly display to their children that they enjoy certain food items , leading to a child 's vicarious learning about the enjoyment of eating certain food types .
such explicit displays of eating behaviors are used as a parenting strategy to promote attitudes toward , and subsequently , consumption of certain foods among children .
our systematic review reveals that both types of modeling are similarly associated with more desirable eating behaviors .
restrictive guidance was found to be negatively associated with unhealthy food consumption , while its association with healthy food consumption was mixed .
this was supported by both the systematic review and meta - analysis .
when the analyses were stratified by age , an interesting pattern emerged .
while the association of restrictive guidancewith healthy food consumption was mixed for younger children , studies with children older than 12 found no evidence for such an effect .
this suggests that restrictive guidance might be ineffective in promoting desirable food choices among older children .
however , it is interesting to note that the relationship between restrictive guidance and unhealthy food consumption was more powerful among older children , as compared to those in the pos .
it is possible that younger children in the pos are less able to follow rules or limits set out by parents due to limited self - regulation capabilities [ 74 ] .
future research is suggested to better understand why this phenomenon exist .
next , using food as reward was found to be related to higher levels of unhealthy eating among children .
this was supported in both the systematic review and meta - analysis .
this is likely due to the fact that foods used as rewards are often unhealthy. by rewarding children 's behavior with these unhealthy food items , children might associate these unhealthy items as positive and valuable , hence consuming more of them when they have the chance [ 75 ] .
pressuring children to eat can lead to effects unintended by the parents .
although a small number of studies found a positive association between pressuring and healthy eating , a larger number of studies found a negative association .
in addition , seven studies showed that pressuring can be associated with higher unhealthy food consumption .
this is also played out in the meta - analysis , with pressuring being shown to have a small negative correlation with healthy food consumption and small positive correlation with unhealthy food consumption .
however , age - stratified analyses revealed that these unintended effects tend to be limited to younger children , as the effects are non - significant in studies involving older children .
the evidence that rewarding food consumption can influence child food consumption was weak , as most studies included in the systematic review showed no significant effects .
the meta - analysis also showed no significant correlation between rewarding food consumption and child food consumption .
on the other hand , a larger proportion of studies found that verbal praise might lead to higher healthy foods consumption , indicating that rewarding with material rewards and praise are distinct practices with different outcomes .
however , it is important to note that rewarding with praise appeared to be more useful with younger children in the pos , with the effects diminished in studies involving older children .
although the number of studies examining accessibility was small , the majority of studies in the systematic review indicated that accessibility can have a positive influence on healthy foods consumption .
this was not supported in the meta - analysis , as there was a non - significant correlation between accessibility and child healthy food consumption .
one reason for this discrepancy might be due to the limited number of studies included in the meta - analysis .
interestingly , active guidance received very little attention from researchers , with only 6 % of the studies treating it as a potential predictor of child food consumption .
despite this , research in the domain of parental mediation has found active discussion to be an effective parental socialization technique in influencing desirable child outcomes [ 76 ] .
the meta - analysis results suggest that these effects might translate well into the child food consumption context , as there was a small to medium , positive , and significant relationship between active guidance and child health food consumption .
one reason for the modest findings could be that the existing measures are inadequate in capturing the concept of active guidance in its entirety .
existing concepts that were used as proxies for active guidance in this study were teaching about nutrition and encouragement through rationale [ 44 , 77 ] .
these constructs are more closely related to factual parental guidance , as opposed to evaluative parental guidance .
factual active guidance refers to informing children with technical knowledge .
such techniques have been found to be ineffective in mitigating negative media effects on children [ 78 , 79 ] .
evaluative active mediation , on the other hand , reflects parents' attempts to provide either positive or negative opinions about a topic , and are considered to be a more effective strategy [ 79 ] .
examining the influence of evaluative , rather than factual parental guidance , might yield stronger associations .
a second reason could be that there were insufficient studies examining the effect of active guidance on older children .
our age - stratified systematic review analysis found that the beneficial effects of active guidance were more pronounced in studies involving older children in cos , as compared to those in pos .
however , only 3 studies out of the 88 unique studies examined active guidance among children older than 7 .
opportunities for future research the systematic review has identified several gaps in the study of parental communication and child food consumption .
first , although some parental communication practices were consistently linked with child food consumption outcomes ( e.g. , modeling and availability ) , many of the other parental communication practices show mixed results ( e.g. , restrictive guidance ) and some are severely understudied ( e.g. , active guidance ) .
more research needs to be conducted in these areas to ascertain the relationships between parental communication and child food consumption behavior .
second , the concept of active guidance is currently underdeveloped and understudied .
although active discussions have been shown to be an effective parental communication strategy in socializing children to more desirable outcomes in other contexts [ 76 ] , there remains a lack of understanding of how parents' active verbal discussions with children apply in the food consumption context .
specifically , there has been a lack of conceptual explication of parental guidance in the food consumption context , with existing studies not taking into account the different facets of parental guidance .
existing studies have examined active parental guidance from the perspective of factual guidance ( e.g. , teaching about nutritional facts ) .
as previous studies have found factual guidance to be less effective than evaluative guidance , future studies should attempt to examine evaluative guidance as a correlate .
existing studies also do not take into account how positive or negative active guidance can influence outcomes .
as healthy eating choices are to be promoted , and unhealthy eating choices are to be discouraged , active guidance as dichotomized into positive vs. negative can have differential impact .
positive active guidance might be more effective in promoting healthy eating , and less effective in discouraging unhealthy eating .
this is suggested in our meta - analysis results where active guidance ( which reflect a more positive construct in the operationalization across studies ) was found to be correlated with healthy eating but not unhealthy eating .
third , theoretically - driven studies of parental communication on child food consumption , which takes into account psychosocial mediating variables , are severely lacking .
the systematic review found that only five studies attempted to understand child food consumption from such a perspective .
without considering the social psychological processes of the child , it is difficult to ascertain the pathways of how certain parental practices are influencing child food consumption behavior .
this means that current understanding of parental communication on child food consumption is incomplete .
limitations there are several limitations of this study that should be taken into account when drawing conclusions from the results .
first , the review was conducted using a non - exhaustive list of studies .
although effort was made to be comprehensive in the retrieval of articles by searching through four major databases and hand - searching relevant articles , there could have been some studies that were missed out on. to minimize this , we hand - searched the reference list of every selected study , which helped ensure greater comprehensiveness in the systematic review .
despite this , it is important to note that the conclusions are drawn from overall trends across studies , rather than from singular studies , rendering a small number of missed articles less consequential .
second , most of the studies were limited to populations in the west .
as nuances in parent - child relationships might exist across cultures , the findings might not generalize across to cultures outside of the west .
lastly , there is a lack of uniformity in measuring a number of these parental variables .
despite this , our efforts to synthesize and categorize the variables have yielded strong agreement rate between two coders .
nonetheless , it is important to note that in several of these studies , there is strong heterogeneity in terms of operationalizing some of these variables , limiting their comparability .
conclusion there is a wide variety of behaviors that parents engage in to either promote or prevent certain child food consumption behaviors .
some behaviors , such as parents' own food consumption behavior , and availing certain types of food , have been shown to be strong correlates of child food consumption behavior .
on the other hand , some behaviors such as active and restrictive guidance , are effective only in certain contexts ; active being more effective in encouraging fruits and vegetables consumption , while restrictive guidance is more effective in discouraging unhealthy eating such as ssbs consumption .
despite this , there appears to be a number of research gaps that needs to be filled .
researchers in the field can take note of the opportunities for future research highlighted from this comprehensive study .
in doing so , we can better understand what constitutes an ideal family environment that helps improve the wellbeing of our children .

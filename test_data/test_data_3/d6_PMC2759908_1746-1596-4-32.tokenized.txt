pleomorphic adenoma , also called benign mixed tumor , is the most common tumor of the salivary glands .
about 90 % of these tumors occur in the parotid gland and 10 % in the minor salivary glands .
the most common sites of pleomorphic adenoma of the minor salivary glands are the palates followed by lips and cheeks .
other rare sites include the throat , floor of the mouth , tongue , tonsil , pharynx , retromolar area and nasal cavity .
in children , intraoral pleomorphic adenomas of the cheek are extremely rare with only three cases reported to date .
here we report a case of pleomorphic adenoma of minor salivary glands of the cheek in a 17 - year - old girl .
the mass was removed by wide local excision with adequate margins , and after a follow - up period of three years there were no recurrences .
to conclude , pleomorphic adenoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cheek masses in youngsters .
wide local excision is to be recommended as the treatment of choice .
a close follow - up is necessary postoperatively .
introduction pleomorphic adenomas are benign salivary gland tumors that represent about 3 - 10 % of the neoplasm of the head and neck region [ 1 ] .
they are the most common tumors ( 50 %) of the major and minor salivary glands [ 2 ] .
the palate is considered as the most common intraoral site ( 42.8 - 68.8 %) , followed by the upper lip ( 10.1 %) and cheek ( 5.5 %) [ 3 - 5 ] .
other rare sites include the throat ( 2.5 %) , retromolar region ( 0.7 %) , floor of the mouth and the alveolar mucosa [ 4 ] .
pleomorphic adenoma usually presents as a mobile slowly growing , painless firm swelling that does not cause ulceration of the overlying mucosa [ 6 ] .
pleomorphic adenoma consists of cells with epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation ( mixed tumor ) .
the highly variable morphology of this neoplasm is the result of interplay between these elements .
now it is widely accepted that both epithelial and mesenchymal ( myxoid , hyaline , chondroid , osseous ) elements often arise from same cell clone , which may be a myoepithelial or ductal reserve cell .
there is no difference in behavior of this neoplasm based on proportion of various elements [ 7 ] .
lee et al examined formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded tissues from 13 pleomorphic adenomas of female patients .
they used the polymerase chain reaction ( humra assay ) .
humara , the human androgen receptor gene , is located on the x chromosome and contains a segment of polymorphic cag tandem repeats in exon 1 .
several methylation - sensitive hhai restriction sites are located 5 ' to these cag repeats .
it is an ideal tool to study clonality of female tissues by examining the methylation pattern .
a monoclonal pattern was seen in the stromal , epithelial elements in the majority of cases .
these findings suggest that the stromal and epithelial cells in pleomorphic adenomas of salivary gland arise from the same clone in most cases [ 7 ] .
variants of pleomorphic adenoma include pleomorphic adenoma with lipomatous change [ 8 ] , myxoliopmatous pleomorphic adenoma , pleomorphic adenoma with squamous differentiation and benign metastasizing mixed tumor [ 9 ] .
the mucosa of the cheek is a uncommon site of occurrence for intraoral pleomorphic adenoma [ 10 ] and most of these cases have been reported in adults [ 11,12 ] .
in children , only three cases were reported to date [ 13 - 15 ] .
here we report a case of pleomorphic adenoma in 17 years old girl .
the relevant studies were discussed .
case report a 17 - year - old girl presented with a slowly growing painless swelling in the right cheek of four years duration .
clinical examination revealed a 2.0 - cm , firm , mobile mass in the right cheek ( 2.0 - cm dorsal to the angle of the mouth ) .
there was no history of trauma , fevers , disturbance of salivation , or oral surgeries .
the laboratory tests were unremarkable .
radiological examination showed no abnormality in the panoramic radiograph ( figure 1 - a ) .
the mass was dissected and excised with safety margins under local anesthesia .
it did not involve the facial muscles or subcutaneous tissue of the cheek .
grossly , the lesion was in the form of an ovoid well demarcated , partially encapsulated , gray - white partly myxoid , partly rubbery mass , measuring 2.0 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm , with solid cut surface ( figure 1 - b - f ) .
on histology , a well - circumscribed growth was seen .
the neoplastic proliferation had biphasic populations of epithelial and mesenchymal cells .
the former was composed of glandular structures lined by round , oval cells having large hyperchromatic nuclei , pink cytoplasm and myoepithelial basal cell layer .
the stroma was myxoid , hyaline and chondroid .
no mitotic figures or necrosis were seen ( figure 2 ) .
postoperative period was uneventful .
the patient was followed up over a period of for 3 years and no recurrences were observed .

figure 2 the histological features of the juvenile pleomorphic adenoma of the cheek .
( a - b ) scanning magnification views of pleomorphic adenoma showing that the tumor is well circumscribed .
the mesenchymal and epithelial elements are evident at these magnifications .
this encapsulated tumor has a protuberance pushing through the capsule ( upper left side ) .
the tumor has abundant chondroid areas .
( c - d ) these views show the essential cytoarchitectural features sufficient for diagnosis of pleomoprhic adenoma .
the tubular strucutes are well delineated from the stroma .
they are lined by inner layer of ductal epithelial cells and other layer of myoepithelial cells .
the latter merge imperceptivity into the surrounding mesenchymal elements .
the tubules have eosinophilic colloid like materials ( secretions ) in their lumens .
the myoepithelial cells appear as cuboidal , spindle , plasmacytoid and non - descript epithelioid cells .
they surround the tubules in a thin layer and in focally thick mantles .
( e - f ) these views show the stroma ( one of the defining component of the pleomorphic adenoma ) .
it is composed of hyaline , homogenous , fibrillary ( e ) and chondromyoxoid ( f ) materials interspersed among the epithelial and myoepithelial cells .
discussion pleomorphic adenoma occurs more frequently in women than in men and is most common from the fourth to sixth decades with a mean age of 43 - 46 years [ 3,4,16 ] .
salivary gland tumors are rare in children and when they do arise , they preferentially affect major salivary glands , but minor salivary gland tumors have also been reported [ 17 ] .
here we report a rare case of juvenile pleomorphic adenoma of the cheek in 17 years old girl .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the fourth case to be reported in literature [ 13 - 15 ] .
the clinicopathologic features of the case reported here concurs with previous studies .
yamamoto et el reported a 9 - year - old japanese girl with pleomorphic adenoma of the cheek mucosa .
cohen and kronenberg reported two more cases of juvenile pleomorphic adenomas of the cheek ( girls , age < 18 years ) [ 13 - 15 ] .
no recurrence was reported in these cases [ 13 - 15 ] .
dhanuthai et al reported the first case of palatal pleomorphic adenoma in a 13 year - old child [ 17 ] .
in children , jorge et al reported five cases of intraoral pleomorphic adenoma in patients under 18 years of age in two brazilian institutions .
four patients were females and one was male ; two cases affected the palate , two the upper lip and one the tongue .
the cases were treated by local excision and long - follow up showed no recurrences were observed .
jorge et al concluded that intraoral pleomorphic adenoma seems to have similar biological characteristics as in adults , with low recurrence rates after surgical resection [ 16 ] .
the surgical treatment for the pleomorphic adenoma in both juvenile and adult patients is principally the same and includes complete wide surgical excision with good safety margins .
inadequate resection or rupture of the capsule or tumors spillage during excision can lead to local recurrence as these tumors often have microscopic interruptions in the capsule [ 16 ] .
in adults , van heerden and his colleagues examined the clinicopathologic features of the oral salivary gland neoplasms .
seventy cases were diagnosed during 8 - year period .
pleomorphic adenoma was the most common entity that accounted for 48 % of all tumors ( not in the cheek ) , but none of these lesions affected the cheek mucosa .
polymorphous low - grade adenocarcinoma comprised 15.7 % of the tumors [ 3 ] .
the differential diagnosis of the juvenile pleomorphic adenoma of the cheek ( table 1 ) includes buccal space abscess , dermoid cyst , foreign body reaction , fibroma , lipoma , neurofibroma , rhabdomyosarcoma , mucoepidermoid carcinoma , adenoid cystic carcinoma , polymorphous low - grade adenocarcinoma and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma [ 16,18 ] .
the possibility of buccal space abscess was ruled out due to absence of sign of inflammation .
the solid nature of the lesion coupled with the lack of tissue representing the three germ layers rule out the possibility of mature cystic teratoma ( dermoid cyst ) .
the lack of ulceration of the buccal mucosa , pain , paresthesia or invasion of the surrounding tissue rules out the possibility of malignant transformation .
carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is characterized by the presence of malignant epithelium ( salivary duct carcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified , terminal duct carcinoma or myoepithelial carcinoma ) with benign stroma .
carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is extensively infiltrative malignancy with necrosis , perineurial invasion , frequent mitotic figures , marked nuclear atypia .
adenoid cystic carcinoma usually shows cribriform , solid or tubular pattern similar to cylindromas of skin .
it is composed of small bland myoepithelial cells with scant cytoplasm and dark compact angular nuclei that surround pseudoglandular spaces with pas + excess basement membrane material and mucin .
peripheral perineurial invasion and small true glandular lumina are sometimes seen but no squamous differentiation ; or extensive necrosis are usually absent .
adenoid cystic carcinoma has high proliferative index , high p53 immunoreactivity , intense staining for bcl - 2 but negative reactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein .
in contrast , pleomorphic adenoma is not invasive , show no perineurial invasion ; has squamous metaplasia and mesenchyme - like areas .
charactaristically , pleomorphic adenoma has strong glial fibrillary acidic protein in the myxochondromatous areas [ 19 ] .
the basal cell carcinoma is a low grade malignancy similar to basal cell adenoma .
it is an infiltrative tumor with perineurial invasion and vascular invasion ; variable cytologic atypia and mitotic activity .
it is composed of solid , trabecular , tubular or membranous patterns but there is no myxoid matrix or cartilegenous areas .
the basal cell adenoma is composed of basaloid cells sharply delineated from the stroma by basement membrane .
the polymorphous low - grade adenocarcinoma is usually nonencapsulated tumor with diverse ( polymorphous ) growth patterns , infiltrative borders , perineurial invasion and rare tumor necrosis [ 3,20 ] .

complete wide surgical excision is the treatment of choice .
recurrence after many years of surgical excision as well as malignant transformation should be a concern and therefore long - term follow - up is necessary .

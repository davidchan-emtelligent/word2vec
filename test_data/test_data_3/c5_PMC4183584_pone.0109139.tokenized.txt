semantic priming tasks are classically used to influence and implicitly promote target behaviors .
recently , several studies have demonstrated that prosocial semantic priming modulated feelings of social affiliation .
the main aim of this study was to determine whether inducing feelings of social affiliation using priming tasks could modulate nonverbal social behaviors in schizophrenia .
we used the scrambled sentence task to prime schizophrenia patients according to three priming group conditions : pro - social , non - social or anti - social .
forty - five schizophrenia patients , diagnosed according to dsm - iv - tr , were randomly assigned to one of the three priming groups of 15 participants .
we evaluated nonverbal social behaviors using the motor - affective subscale of the motor - affective - social - scale .
results showed that schizophrenia patients with pro - social priming had significantly more nonverbal behaviors than schizophrenia patients with anti - social and non - social priming conditions .
schizophrenia patient behaviors are affected by social priming .
our results have several clinical implications for the rehabilitation of social skills impairments frequently encountered among individuals with schizophrenia .

introduction semantic priming is an experimental procedure in which exposure to a stimulus influences a response to a later stimulus .
semantic priming has been the standard paradigm for evaluating the associations among concepts stored in semantic memory [ 1 ] .
a ' priming effect ' classically refers to a change in reaction time to answer a stimulus word after having been exposed to a previous related word ( i.e. cat - dog versus cat - leg ) .
in the recent years , a great amount of evidence has been accumulated to suggest that priming tasks can be used to induce a feeling of social affiliation and to facilitate cooperative behaviors between two individuals [ 2 ] .
for example , lakin and chartrand [ 3 ] showed that prosocial primes elicit stronger unconscious mimicry during social interaction .
young children were found to help a person in need more often , and more spontaneously , when primed with photographs evoking affiliation than when primed with photographs evoking individuality [ 4 ] .
these results suggest that promoting social behaviors by activating social goal representations ( e.g. nonverbal behaviors ) may have interesting applications in patients with severe interpersonal impairments .
social deficits are a feature of many mental disorders , such as schizophrenia [ 5 ] , characterized by a link between social functioning deficits and nonverbal expressiveness ( spontaneous hand gestures and spontaneous smiles ) [ 6 ] .
classically , social deficits in schizophrenia have to date been treated by means of cognitive remediation or social skills training therapy .
the former of these interventions has shown limited benefits [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] and , while the latter has shown effects on social cognition , relevant studies have been few [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] and to our knowledge none of them have targeted nonverbal social behaviors .
past studies investigating priming schizophrenia patients have shown conflicting results .
in reaction time task toward a word target using a priming task , rossell and david ( 2006 ) found a significant decrease in reaction time compared to healthy controls ( hyperpriming ) but some years before , the same authors found a significant increase in reaction time ( hypopriming ) [ 12 ] .
finally , other studies found a comparable reaction time in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls .
these studies taken together point out that schizophrenia patient were as sensitive to priming effects as healthy individuals [ 13 ] .
however , such studies only used the priming task to examine abnormal semantic network activation in schizophrenia and not as a therapeutic tool in this pathology .
nevertheless , reductions in social motor behaviors play a role in social deficits in this pathology [ 6 ] .
nonverbal behavior impairments are often characterized by a reduction in the number of spontaneous gestures [ 14 ] - [ 17 ] .
in particular , a recent review of lavelle et al .
( 2014 ) showed that schizophrenia patients displayed fewer hand gestures and less variability and flexible facial expressions during social interactions .
additionally , nonverbal behavior reductions , in schizophrenia , were linked with a decrease in social competences [ 18 ] and social functioning [ 6 ] .
given the social deficits observed in this disorder , it seems essential to investigate the effect of social priming on nonverbal behaviors in schizophrenia .
the main aim of the current study was to determine whether social priming could modulate nonverbal social behaviors of patients suffering from schizophrenia .
we evaluated nonverbal social behaviors using the motor - affective subscale of the motor - affective - social - scale ( mass ) [ 19 ] in order to compare the effect of three kinds of social priming ( pro - social , non - social and anti - social ) on schizophrenia patients .
we expected that in the pro - social priming condition , the number of nonverbal social behaviours in schizophrenia participants would be significantly increased compared to the non - social and the anti - social social priming conditions .
materials and methods participants forty - five schizophrenia patients diagnosed according to dsm - iv - tr criteria participated in this study .
diagnoses were established using the structured clinical interview for dsm - iv ( scid - cv ) [ 20 ] .
patients were in the stable phase of the illness according to the current treating psychiatrist , and categorized , as had no hospitalizations or changes in housing in the month prior to entering the study .
all individuals with schizophrenia were receiving antipsychotic medication at the time of participation and were recruited from the university department of adult psychiatry in montpellier .
exclusion criteria for both groups were : ( a ) known neurological disease , ( b ) developmental disability , or ( c ) substance abuse in the past month .
all participants were proficient in the french language , had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and naive as to the purpose of the study .
participants gave written consent to participate in this experiment .
the capacity of the patients to provide informed consent was established through a structured interview , and was also confirmed by their treating psychiatrists .
the local ethics committee approved the study ( cpp sud mediterannee iii , montpellier , france afssaps 2009 - a00513 - 54 24 , 07 / 22 / 2009 ) conforming to the declaration of helsinki .
one day before testing , neurologic soft signs and extrapyramidal symptoms were rated using the neurological soft signs scale ( nss ) [ 21 ] , the level of depressive symptoms was assessed with the beck depression inventory - ii ( bdi - ii ) [ 22 ] , the premorbid iq was evaluated using the french national adult reading test ( fnart ) [ 23 ] , and an indication of their social anxiety was obtained using the liebowitz - social - anxiety - scale ( lsas ) [ 24 ] .
finally for schizophrenia patients , the severity of symptoms was assessed using the positive and negative syndrome scale ( panss ) [ 25 ] and social functioning was assessed by the modified prosocial subscale of the panss [ 26 ] ( see table 1 for participants' characteristics ) .

procedure schizophrenia patients who were blind to the real goal of the experiment were randomly assigned to one of three conditions ( pro - social , anti - social and non - social ) .
upon arrival at the laboratory , the participant had to complete one first task .
the task was purportedly designed to examine the effect of color on the ability to form comprehensible sentences ( priming task ) .
a first experimenter , always the same for all patients and blind to the purpose of the study , verbally explained the instructions for each task .
participants were told that they should use four of the five words to make a complete sentence .
they would have to say the sentence verbally and a new screen would appear with five different words in different colors .
immediately after having completed the priming task ( either the pro - social , anti - social or non - social condition ) , schizophrenia patients were tested for nonverbal social behaviors using the motor - affective subscale of the mass by a second experimenter ( always the same ) blind to the specific conditions of priming to prevent any " un - blind experimenter effect " [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
material social priming task : scrambled - sentence task stimuli were presented on a computer screen ( 60 hz ,. 45 m , 1280x800 pixels ) .
viewing was unrestrained at a distance of approximately.6 m. in the priming task , words were presented in color on a white background .
each trial showed five words arranged horizontally across the screen .
words were presented in arial , font size 24 and the color of the words varied randomly over trials .
they were presented in either green , blue , red , yellow or black ( figure 1 ) .
three versions of the scrambled - sentence task were constructed ( see [ 29 ] for a similar procedure ) : one was intended to prime the pro - social attitude ( affiliation ) , another the anti - social attitude ( non - affiliation ) and a third was intended to prime no attitude , the non - social priming condition .
for all versions , 24 trials contained an adjective or a verb semantically related to the trait in question .
for the pro - social version , the critical priming words were : friendly , pleasant , states , altruist , friendship , friend , courteous , company , sociable , community , communicative , reunited , cooperative , dating , gathered , group , together , popularity , team , share , family , frequented , married , interaction .
for the anti - social version , the critical priming words were : unique , individual , autonomous , lonesome , oneself , alone , separated , contained , disagreeable , seclusion , detached , uncooperative , divided , rebel , egocentric , selfish , personal , single , neglecting , unpopular , isolated , independent , locked , individually .
the non - social version consisted of the 24 non - social words .
the non - social words were : tomato , stone , box , branch , cloud , river , plank , light bulb , carpet , bag , button , fog , table , tree , wood , hill , spoon , radio , step , curtains , picture , wind , road , brick .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0109139.g001 figure 1 experimental setup for the priming task .
participants sat on a chair in front of a screen .
participants were told that they should use four of the five words to make a complete sentence .
they then would say the sentence verbally and a new screen would appear with five different words on it for the next trial .
prior to the experiment , a pre - test was carried out to verify the semantic relationship between the target words and the attitudes that we intended to prime .
two separate samples , not included in the main experiment , of 10 schizophrenia patients and 10 healthy controls were asked to rate each word in terms of how social they considered it to be on a 7 - point scale ( - 3 = very anti - social , 3 = very pro - social ) .
a friedman test indicated significant differences between pro - social , non - social and anti - social words in their perceived relation to sociality ( p <. 001 ) .
results confirmed that the schizophrenia group and the healthy control group were equivalent in their judgments ( pro - social words : p = . 288 ; non - social words : p = . 676 and anti - social words : p = . 520 ) and that the stimulus words were strongly related to the attitudes that they were intended to prime .
nonverbal social behavior task tremeau et al .
( 2008 ) developed the motor - affective - social - scale ( mass ) for schizophrenia .
the first part of this scale , the motor affective subscale of the mass , assesses fundamental expressive deficits by evaluating spontaneous smiles , hand gestures , voluntary smiles and speech flow .
the second part of the mass assesses the lack of initiation ( avolition ) through motor retardation , personal hygiene , attendance at groups and verbal interaction .
in our study , we used the first part of this scale to assess the social priming effect on nonverbal social behaviors in schizophrenia .
an interviewer / rater ( always the same ) , blind to the conditions of priming , assessed nonverbal social behaviors .
during a structured interview , participants were asked three questions in the same order .
first , participants were asked to report everything they did the day before ( for 2 min ) .
second , they were asked to describe a movie from memory ( for 1 min ) .
third , they were asked to imagine what they would do if given one million euros ( for 30 s ) .
after the interview , participants were asked to make their " most beautiful smile " , and pre - defined behavioral anchors were used to rate the posed smiling .
interviewers were instructed to ask the predefined questions each time the participant 's speech flow stopped for 3 s. four behaviors were recorded and rated : spontaneous smiles , spontaneous hand nonverbal gestures , speech flow and voluntary facial expression .
smiles are defined as bilateral upper movements of both lip corners ( contraction of the zygomatic muscle ) with or without contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle .
the rules to rate one smile were i ) count one smile if you observe a clear smiling expression or an expression that gives you an impression of smiling ( it is not always possible for the interviewer to identify the muscular movement accompanying a smiling expression during an interview ) , ii ) do not consider intensity and iii ) do not consider the communicative value of smiles ( even a smile that appears to be sarcastic counts as one , if both lip corners move ) .
the rules to count two distinct smiles were i ) two smiles should be differentiated by a resting period of two seconds and ii ) if smiling is continuous , count one new smile every three seconds .
spontaneous hand gestures are defined as hand movements directly tied to speech to illustrate or stress what is being said ( also called " illustrators ") or to replace a word or a sentence , such as pointing with a finger or waving a hand to mean " no " ( also called " emblems ") .
nonverbal gestures should be differentiated from adaptors ( non - communicative , self - stimulating , hand - to - body gestures , such as scratching , touching face with hand , hair playing , hand rubbing , playing with buttons ) and from abnormal movements ( tremors , dyskinesia , and dystonia ) .
rules to rate one nonverbal gesture were i ) one gesture can involve hand movement only ( at the wrist level ) or arm movement with or without wrist movements .
for movements of fingers only , rate emblematic movements only ( such as movements of fingers to say " no " , or to express numbers ) , ii ) hand nonverbal gestures must be of enough amplitude to be clearly seen : small movements of wrists that are hardly visible should not be counted and iii ) rate occurrences of unilateral or bilateral hand gestures indistinctively ( bilateral hand movements that occur at the same time only count for one occurrence ) .
rules to count two distinct hand nonverbal gestures were i ) if a resting period ( hands on chair or body , or hands and arms kept in the same position for at least two seconds ) is observed between two gestures , ii ) if the same gesture continues for more than three seconds , count one gesture every three seconds and iii ) if two gestures are tied to two different ideas or words : for example hand nonverbal gestures accompanying the following speech : " i went there , and then came back here " count as two gestures .
the number of questions or instructions coming from the interviewer assessed speech flow .
rules to count one question were i ) do not rate interviewer 's first instruction , questions or instructions irrelevant to the conversation theme ( such as : " could you speak louder ? ?
" could you take your hands out of your pockets ?") , and comments ( such as " you are doing well ") , ii ) if the subject shows looseness of associations or tangentiality , or does not answer your question , you should repeat the same question once ( do not count it ) and if necessary ask a different question ( counts as a new question ) and iii ) if the subject 's speech is very slow with pauses more than 5 seconds long between words or sentences , the interviewer should express back - channel verbal communication such as " and ?" , " yes ?" , " ok " , " go ahead " and must count it as one question ( this does not apply to the subject 's first sentence , just after interviewer 's instruction ) .
rules to count two distinct questions were i ) the same question or instruction asked on two separate occasions during the interview counts twice ; for example " tell me more about this " , " what else did you do this morning ?" .
voluntary smile was defined as the voluntary action of smiling .
the facial expression must give the impression of a smile ( grimaces even involving the contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle should not be counted as a smile ) .
a small smile can be defined as a smile in which each lip corner does not move up more than 2 mm from resting position .
the contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle leads to the bulging of the inferior eyelid and to the squinting of the eye ( crow 's feet ) .
if the subject has wrinkles at the corner of his / her eyes , look for an increase in the eyes squinting .
each occurrence of these behaviors was transferred on a likert scale of 1 - 4 .
total number of spontaneous smiles was rated as follows : i ) 0 smile corresponded to a score of 1 on the likert scale , ii ) 1 - 2 smiles corresponded to a score of 2 on the likert scale , iii ) 3 - 5 smiles corresponded to a score of 3 on the likert scale and iiii ) 5 smiles and above corresponded to a score of 4 on the likert scale .
total number of spontaneous hand nonverbal gestures was rated as follows : i ) 0 - 3 hand gestures corresponded to a score of 1 on the likert scale , ii ) 4 - 9 hand gestures corresponded to a score of 2 on the likert scale , iii ) 10 - 20 hand gestures corresponded to a score of 3 on the likert scale and iiii ) 21 hand gestures and above corresponded to a score of 4 on the likert scale .
total number of questions was rated as follows : i ) 0 - 1 question corresponded to a score of 4 on the likert scale , ii ) 2 - 4 questions corresponded to a score of 2 on the likert scale , iii ) 5 - 7 questions corresponded to a score of 3 on the likert scale and iiii ) 8 questions and above corresponded to a score of 1 on the likert scale .
the quality of voluntary smile was rated as follows : i ) << no expression or smile only >> corresponded to a score of 1 on the likert scale , ii ) << small smile and smiling for more than 4 seconds or large smile only >> corresponded to a score of 2 on the likert scale , iii ) << large smile and smiling for more than 4 seconds >> corresponded to a score of 3 on the likert scale and iiii ) << large smile and smiling for more than 4 seconds and crow 's feet for more than 4 seconds >> corresponded to a score of 4 on the likert scale .
the global measure was determined as the sum of scores for each item ( max 16 on the likert scale ) .
a high score on the motor - affective subscale of the mass means fewer impairments of nonverbal social behaviors .
statistical analysis clinical ratings and nonverbal behavior displays were separately compared for the three groups with a non - parametric kruskal - wallis test .
in order to compare the scores of schizophrenia patients with pro - social priming , anti - social priming , and non - social priming , non - parametric mann - whitney u tests were computed for each nonverbal social behavior performance .
the level of significance was set to p <. 05 .
results demographic and clinical measures the results revealed no difference on the basic demographic and clinical information between schizophrenia groups ( see table 1 ) .
nonverbal social behavior measures the kruskal - wallis test on the global nonverbal behaviors assessed by the motor - affective subscale of the mass revealed a significant main effect for priming conditions ( h = 9.542 , p = . 008 ) .
contrast comparisons revealed that schizophrenia patients primed with pro - social words showed significantly more nonverbal behaviors than schizophrenia patients primed with anti - social priming words ( z = - 2.918 , p = . 004 ) and than schizophrenia patients primed with non - social priming words ( z = - 2.231 , p = . 026 ) .
schizophrenia patients in non - social and anti - social priming conditions were not different ( p >. 05 , see figure 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0109139.g002 figure 2 total number of nonverbal behaviors .
schizophrenia patients ( sz ) primed in pro - social condition and sz primed in non - social and anti - social conditions were significantly different .
sz primed in non - social condition and sz primed in anti - social condition were equivalent .
error bars represent standard deviations .
* p <. 05 and ** p <. 001 .
results demonstrated that schizophrenia patients primed with non - social words and patients primed with anti - social words were equivalent on all four dimensions of the motor - affective subscale of the mass ( spontaneous smiles , spontaneous hand gestures , speech flow and voluntary facial expression , all p >. 05 , see figure 3 ) .
however , pro - social priming affected the different nonverbal behaviors in schizophrenia patients .
compared to anti - social priming , pro - social priming significantly increased spontaneous hand gestures score ( z = - 2.253 , p = . 024 ) , speech flow score ( z = - 2.356 , p = . 018 ) and marginally enhanced voluntary facial expression score ( z = - 1.824 , p = . 068 ) .
the spontaneous smile measure was equivalent between schizophrenia groups primed with pro - social and anti - social conditions .
schizophrenia patients in pro - social priming also had a higher score on voluntary facial expression than patients with non - social priming ( z = - 2.023 , p = . 043 ) .
they also exhibited a marginally greater score on the spontaneous smiles measure ( z = - 1.814 , p = . 070 ) .
finally , spontaneous hand gestures and speech flow dimensions were equivalent between schizophrenia patients primed with pro - social and non - social priming conditions .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0109139.g003 figure 3 subdimensions of nonverbal behavior .

discussion it was shown repeatedly that goals can be activated outside of awareness through semantic priming and then nonconsciously operate to increase goal - directed behavior [ 30 ] - [ 36 ] .
concerning social priming , the goal - activation theory of bargh et al .
( 2001 ) predicts that social priming activates an affiliation goal representation , which then automatically leads to the pursuit of that goal .
in their initial study , bargh et al .
( 2001 ) showed that nonconscious social goal activation promoted not only goal - directed action but also increased and maintained the motivation over time to achieve the social goal behavior [ 32 ] .
these results have been replicated in numerous studies [ 2 ] .
surprisingly , although nonverbal social behaviors are known to be strongly impaired in schizophrenia [ 14 ] - [ 17 ] , no study has tested whether social priming might affect such deficits .
the main goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of social priming on nonverbal social behaviors in schizophrenia .
to this aim , we used the scrambled - sentence task , inspired of leighton et al .
( 2008 ) but initially developed by srull and wyer [ 37 ] , to socially prime schizophrenia patients according to three priming group conditions ( i.e. , pro - social , anti - social and non - social conditions ) .
nonverbal social behaviors in a subsequent interaction were then measured .
as hypothesized , schizophrenia patients in the pro - social priming condition exhibited significantly more nonverbal behaviors than schizophrenia patients primed with non - social and anti - social conditions and these two groups ( non - social and anti - social conditions ) were not statistically different .
these results are in line with the literature [ 29 ] , [ 38 ] and confirm that schizophrenia patients are sensitive to the social priming effect [ 13 ] .
for the first time , results indicate that the production of nonverbal behaviors during social interaction , repeatedly shown as impaired in schizophrenia [ 14 ] - [ 17 ] , can be significantly promoted using pro - social priming .
more specifically , our results indicate that , in schizophrenia participants , pro - social priming significantly increased several dimensions ( i.e. spontaneous hand gestures , speech flow and voluntary facial expression ) of the motor - affective subscale of the mass compared to the anti - social priming condition .
in addition , we found that pro - social priming increased significantly voluntary facial expressions and the number of spontaneous smiles compared to the non - social condition .
importantly , equivalence of demographical and psychological variables ( i.e. , depression , anxiety level , symptomatological level and social functioning ) between our groups suggests that our results are not due to these potential confounding variables .
a large body of evidence demonstrated that nonverbal behaviors play a key role in interpersonal human communication [ 39 ] .
in a recent study , we found that fewer nonverbal behaviors during social interaction as measured by the mass were positively correlated with a poor social functioning in schizophrenia [ 6 ] .
thus , social goal activation during therapeutic groups , such as social skills groups , could increase and help maintaining the acquisition of new social competencies by the patients .
mainly , the repetition of social priming task in schizophrenia may be used to automate this social goal activation during social interactions , and increase the achievement of social behaviors and thus , promote better social functioning in schizophrenia .
therefore , we think that this study shows that an experimental task such as a social priming task could have important clinical implications for patients .
although additional research is needed , our results suggest that social priming could be a powerful add - on clinical care tool in schizophrenia and probably in other mental disorders with severe social impairments such as social phobia or autism .
the present study has some limitations .
first , the sample size for the groups was small , which may have influenced the representativeness of the samples as well as the power of the tests .
future research should confirm our findings using larger samples .
a second limitation is that the motor - affective subscale of the mass is limited by its item quantification on a likert scale of 1 - 4 , which limits the tool 's sensitivity , and by the assessment of voluntary facial expression , which is quantified by only one item .
a more sensitive tool could enable more accurate assessment of the global nonverbal social behaviors .
a third limitation is that the second experimenter was not blind to the purpose of the study .
nevertheless it must be noted that as our study was an exploratory study without initial hypothesis that could have biased our results .
conclusion schizophrenia patients have been characterized as having a reduced number of nonverbal gestures during social interactions .
nonverbal gesture reductions have been linked to an important reduction in social functioning .
specifically targeting nonverbal behavioral deficits in this pathology seems to be of great importance to promote better quality of life of patients .
our study reveals that a social priming task can help promote nonverbal expressive behaviors during social interactions in schizophrenia patients .
social priming tasks may be useful to activate social goal during therapeutic groups activities , such as social skills training , and help facilitate the acquisition of new social competencies in patients .

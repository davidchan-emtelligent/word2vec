the role of spatially controlled cell proliferation in limb bud morphogenesis " numerical precision is the very soul of science , and its attainment affords the best , perhaps the only criterion of the truth of theories and the correctness of experiments . "
- d'arcy thompson , on growth and form ( 1917 ) this year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of d'arcy thompson , the british biologist , classicist , and all round polymath ( for more information on d'arcy thompson see www.darcythompson.org ) .
like many , he was fascinated by the appearance and structure of living matter , and in his influential book , on growth and form [ 1 ] , he set out to describe and explain the principles of morphogenesis - - the way living things grow and acquire their forms .
using a vast range of examples , from the honeycomb in beehives to the spirals in a snail 's shell , he emphasized that form should be studied in the context of growth and that to explain shape it was essential to understand the underlying mechanisms .
this led to the central thesis of the book : biological forms are the result of mechanical and physical processes that should be described with mathematical precision .
yet , while the molecular basis of pattern formation and cellular differentiation during development has received much attention , our knowledge of the regulation of growth and organ shape lags behind .
partly , this is because acquiring accurate high - resolution 3 - d measurements of organ shape and cellular behaviour and the quantitative analysis of these data has been technically challenging .
thus , 3 - d organs are often studied using simpler 2 - d representations .
however , in recent years new imaging technology and the increase in computational power has begun to overcome these limitations , revealing previously unseen detail and allowing long - standing hypotheses to be tested .
in broad terms , the morphogenesis of a developing tissue is achieved by anisotropic growth. that is , the tissue expands in unequal amounts in different directions , so that the final organ shape gradually materializes .
two fundamentally different ways to achieve anisotropic growth can be envisioned ( figure 1 ) .
in one case , external mechanical forces mould the final organ form .
as a result , cells are reshaped or rearranged by forces imposed from outside .
for example , growth substrates exert surface tension on cultured cells , while blood flow exerts shear on endothelial cells ( see [ 2 ]) .
10.1371 / journal.pbio.1000421.g001 figure 1 examples of mechanisms that could account for changes in organ shape .
in isotropic growth , the tissue grows equally in all directions .
in anisotropic growth , there is more growth in some directions than others ( in this case more growth occurs vertically , resulting in an elongated shape ) .
anisotropic growth can result from organ - extrinsic or intrinsic mechanisms .
extrinsic : the tissue elongates in response to directional forces imposed from outside .
intrinsic mechanisms result from two types of cell behavior : non - directional and directional .
non - directional : in non - uniform proliferation rate the orientation of divisions is random , but more divisions occur in some places in the tissue than others .
cell size can also change non - uniformly , resulting in different cell densities in different parts of the tissue .
directional : cell migration translocates cells in a preferred direction .
oriented cell division occurs when the spatial allocation of the daughter cells is directionally biased , resulting in elongated " clones " of cells .
( the red and green cells are given for reference ) .
alternatively , shape formation can be inherent to the organ and result from the collective behaviour of the individual cells comprising the organ .
importantly , two distinct classes of cellular behaviour can contribute to this active tissue modelling ( figure 1 ) .
in the first class , anisotropy results from cellular processes that occur non - directionally , but at different frequency across the tissue ( e.g. , proliferation , apoptosis , change of cell shape ) .
for example , differences in proliferation rate across an organ could cause some parts to expand faster than others .
for this to happen , cells must " know " only their position in a tissue , but not their spatial orientation. by contrast , the second class of mechanisms relies on directional - - anisotropic - - cellular activity .
these could be , for instance , oriented division or migration of cells in a specified direction .
such mechanisms require a cue that provides cells with a bearing - - a vector .
although fundamentally different , experimentally it has often proved difficult to distinguish between these classes of cell behaviour , since each can result in a cell changing its relative position within an organ .
moreover , these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and a combination of passive , active , directional and non - directional cellular behaviours could play a role in defining organ shape .
thus , determining the contribution of different behaviour types is necessary for understanding the molecular mechanisms of organ morphogenesis .
one tissue that exemplifies the problem of distinguishing the mechanism of morphogenesis is the developing limb. from amphibians to mammals , the limbs of tetrapods start growing from small bulges called limb buds .
initially , these buds are composed of loose mesenchymal cells , ensheathed by a layer of ectodermal cells ( figure 2 ) .
at the distal rim of the limb bud , the ectoderm is thickened into the " apical ectodermal ridge " ( aer ) , which secretes extracellular signals , notably members of the fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) family , that are important for limb outgrowth and patterning ( see [ 3 ]) .
following limb bud initiation , but prior to the laying down of the skeletal elements , limb tissue extends mainly in a distal direction , away from the body , such that the length along the proximal - distal axis increases much faster than the anterior - posterior or dorsal - ventral axes .
thus , the developing limb serves as a good example of anisotropic growth and raises the question of what mechanisms contribute to the distal outgrowth .
10.1371 / journal.pbio.1000421.g002 figure 2 geometry and patterning of the limb bud .
a ) geometry of the limb bud .
yellow - ectodermal layer .
blue - dorsal .
green - ventral mesenchyme .
red line indicates the dorsoventral boundary ( solid - posterior , dashed - anterior ) .
the thick grey lines represent the flank , with the dots indicating the points of cross - section between the posterior and the dorsal view .
b ) expression domains of patterning signals .
the aer - apical ectodermal ridge , expresses fgf encoding genes ( fgf8 , fgf4 , fgf9 , fgf17 ) .
the zpa - zone of polarizing activity , is the source of sonic hedgehog ( shh ) .
bone morphogenetic protein ( bmp4 ) is expressed in a broad domain , which is progressively restricted in time .
gremlin1 is a bmp antagonist .
bmp , gremlin , shh , and fgf are interlinked in signaling feedback loops , which causes their domains of expression and activity to change over time ( see [ 37 ]) .
wnt5a is expressed in a proximo - distal gradient , with highest levels at the tip of the limb bud [ 38 ] .
the realization that the aer is the source of a proliferative signal has provided the inspiration for a " growth - based morphogenesis " model of limb development [ 4 ],[ 5 ] .
according to this view , proximal - distal elongation of the limb bud results from a gradient of proliferation rates along this axis , which represents a non - directional mechanism .
indeed , measurements of cell cycle duration confirmed that distally located cells proliferate faster [ 6 ] .
moreover , computational models , some dating back more than 40 years , have been used to check if these differences in proliferation rate could explain limb morphogenesis .
these models were restricted to one - or two - dimensional representations of the limb and suggested that " growth - based morphogenesis " could be responsible for shaping the limb .
but , other mechanisms were not ruled out , and it is notable that in some models directional behaviors or external mechanical constraints were included to make them conform more closely to empirical observation [ 7 ] - [ 11 ] .
in an article in this issue of plos biology , boehm et al. revisit the " growth - based morphogenesis " model , utilizing the latest imaging and computation techniques .
their approach differs in three significant ways from previous studies and , in the spirit of d'arcy thompson , offers a new level of precision .
first , boehm et al. used the recently introduced technique of optical projection tomography ( opt ) [ 12 ] to produce a 3 - d high - resolution image of the growing mouse limb. with this they generated an in silico limb bud that can be used to test any model of limb morphogenesis .
second , boehm et al. systematically collected proliferation rate and cell density data , which , unlike previous studies , do not depend on assumptions about the length of cell cycle phases .
these data were combined to produce a 3 - d map of proliferation rates in the developing limb bud .
finally , the authors constructed a 3 - d computer model to simulate how the realistic opt replica would grow given the measured proliferation rates .
in this model , the volume of the limb was subdivided into ~ 27,000 connected tetrahedral building blocks , called " finite elements. " the effect of growth was simulated by increasing the volume of each finite element at a rate corresponding to the proliferation rate at that location in the limb .
to determine how the simultaneous expansion of all the elements and their influence on each other affected overall limb shape , the authors used the observation that the limb mesenchyme has physical properties similar to an incompressible viscous fluid .
this allowed them to use principles from fluid mechanics to predict the expansion and trajectory of each element from the measurements of proliferation rate .
the model was tested by comparing the simulated to the real limb bud shape .
what does this analysis tell us ?
first , the data rule out " growth - based morphogenesis " as the main driver of morphogenesis .
although boehm et al. confirm that distal proliferation rates are twice those of proximally located cells , these differences cannot account for the resulting limb shape .
second , using the computer model to systematically explore a wide range of growth rates , the authors show that it is theoretically possible to produce the observed limb shape using non - directional mechanisms .
for this to happen , however , some regions would have to have cell cycle times of less than 2h - - at least 5 times faster than observed - - whereas in other regions , up to 10 % of the cells would have to shrink or die .
the modelling also indicated that a significant number of cells (~ 20 %) enter the limb bud from the flanking mesenchyme during this period of morphogenesis .
one possibility , therefore , is that the cells entering the limb push those already in the limb bud in a distal direction .
however , boehm et al. argue that the evidence does not favour this mechanism .
instead , they find a directional bias to the filopodia extensions and to the orientation of division of cells throughout the limb bud mesenchyme .
this indicates that some kind of active directional - - anisotropic - - cell behaviour is the most likely explanation for the changes of limb shape .
the study refocuses attention on active directional mechanisms of morphogenesis .
similar conclusions have been reached in studies of 2 - d tissues , such as epithelial sheets .
most notably , biases in the orientation of cell division are involved in shaping both the drosophila wing disc and the petals of flowering plants [ 13 ] - [ 15 ] , suggesting that this mechanism might be commonly used in development .
future studies will need to address how directional cell behaviours account for limb growth .
boehm et al. ' s data suggest it might involve a convergence - extension - like process , rather than straightforward distal movement .
addressing this issue will require tracing the trajectories of individual cells , using in vivo imaging techniques .
this is technically challenging because of the size and opacity of limb buds and the difficultly in culturing the tissue in a suitable way for time - lapse imaging .
however , improvements in automated cell tracking and techniques , such as live opt and fluorescence light - sheet microscopy , are making promising advances in this direction [ 16 ] - [ 18 ] .
in addition , to interpret such imaging data , it will be necessary to develop methods for 3 - d data analysis and biophysical mechanical models of the cellular behaviours and forces that contribute to the emergent anisotropic tissue growth .
another major question that arises from these studies is the nature of the cues responsible for anisotropic cell behaviours .
such cues could be biochemical or mechanical .
several secreted signals form gradients in the limb bud and regulate the growth and patterning of the tissue ( figure 2 ) [ 3 ] .
moreover , these gradients were initially proposed to provide the tissue with some inherent polarity [ 19 ] .
but direct involvement of morphogens in anisotropic cell behaviours , such as oriented division or migration , has received only limited attention recently [ 14 ],[ 20 ] .
in the limb , one study showed that an ectopic fgf4 source causes displacement of mesenchymal cells towards it [ 21 ] , thus raising the possibility that fgf emanating from the aer regulates directional behaviour .
this would be consistent with the role of fgf signaling in guiding cell migration during gastrulation [ 22 ],[ 23 ] .
in addition , it might be significant that the shortened and widened limb shape of talpid3 mutant chick embryos looks similar to boehm et al. ' s computer predictions of limb buds lacking directional cell movements .
the talpid3 gene encodes a centrosomal protein involved in forming cilia [ 24 ] .
as a consequence sonic hedgehog ( shh ) signaling , which is required for patterning the anterior - posterior axis of the limb bud , is defective in talpid3 mutants [ 25 ] .
however , the motility and adhesion of isolated talpid3 mutant mesenchymal limb bud cells is also abnormal [ 21 ]. whether this motility defect is related to shh signaling , or to a different role of cilia , such as mechanosensing [ 26 ] , and whether it contributes to the abnormal limb shape remains to be investigated .
in addition , cells could also acquire a sense of direction in response to the planar cell polarity ( pcp ) pathway .
pcp signaling is involved in reorganizing epithelial packing geometries ( e.g. , during drosophila wing development [ 27 ]) and in convergent extension movements [ 28 ] .
pcp has been shown to contribute to organ shape via controlling the directional bias of cell activities , such as cell elongation , junction remodeling , or orientation of the division axis [ 29 ] .
these anisotropic processes are accompanied by changes in the mechanical forces exerted by cells on their neighbours , and could be mediated via junctional or cytoskeletal components ( e.g. , [ 30 ],[ 31 ]) .
however , the precise molecular mechanisms and function of the pathway are not fully understood [ 32 ],[ 33 ] .
the involvement of pcp in vertebrate limb development has not been explored , but mutants lacking wnt5a , a pcp regulator , have shortened limbs [ 34 ],[ 35 ]. whether this is because of a role for planar polarity in the directional behaviour of limb cells is not clear .
thus , it remains to be determined to what extent cells' " sense of direction " emerges from local mechanical forces , or depends on initial asymmetries in tissue structure and boundaries , or on global external cues .
in conclusion , directional cell activities , such as oriented division or migration , appear to play a key role in organ morphogenesis .
however , the cues and forces that provide cells with an orientation vector to achieve this anisotropic cell behaviour remain to be fully explored .
future studies need to identify which processes are directional , how these contribute to organ shape , and how they are coordinated with pattern specification and growth .
this highlights the need for a systems approach providing an integrative understanding of different processes that are concurrent during organogenesis ( also see [ 36 ]). and almost 100 years after d'arcy thompson pointed this out , we are reminded that the study of morphogenesis requires knowledge of the relationship between growth and form , acquired from precise experimental observations and interpreted in the context of biophysical laws .

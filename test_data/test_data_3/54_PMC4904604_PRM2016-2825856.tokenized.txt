identifying which patients are most likely to be at risk of chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury ( mtbi ) is a difficult clinical challenge. objectives .
to examine the relationship between pain catastrophizing , defined as the exaggerated negative appraisal of a pain experience , and early mtbi outcome. methods .
this cross - sectional design included 58 patients diagnosed with a mtbi .
in addition to medical chart review , postconcussion symptoms were assessed by self - report at 1 month ( time 1 ) and 8 weeks ( time 2 ) after mtbi .
pain severity , psychological distress , level of functionality , and pain catastrophizing were measured by self - report at time 2. results .
the pain catastrophizing subscales of rumination , magnification , and helplessness were significantly correlated with pain severity ( r = . 31 to . 44 ) , number of postconcussion symptoms reported ( r = . 35 to . 45 ) , psychological distress ( r = . 57 to . 67 ) , and level of functionality ( r = - . 43 to - . 29 ) .
pain catastrophizing scores were significantly higher for patients deemed to be at high risk of postconcussion syndrome ( 6 or more symptoms reported at both time 1 and time 2 ). conclusions .
higher levels of pain catastrophizing were related to adverse early mtbi outcomes .
the early detection of pain catastrophizing may facilitate goal - oriented interventions to prevent or minimize the development of chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms .
1. introduction traumatic brain injuries ( tbis ) constitute a leading cause of disability around the world [ 1 - 3 ]. between 75 % and 90 % of tbis are typically classified as mild traumatic brain injuries ( mtbis , 4 ) .
symptoms reported during the acute phase ( within days ) following mtbi are generally categorized as physical , psychological , or neurocognitive in nature [ 4 - 6 ] .
although physical symptoms are typically reported in the acute phase following injury , discrepancies remain regarding the nature and prevalence of other symptoms after mtbi [ 7 - 9 ] .
previous studies suggest that up to 80 % of patients present at least one symptom in the acute period , and close to 50 % of patients report one or more persisting symptoms at 3 months following mtbi [ 10 , 11 ] .
pain is a significant problem following tbi and more particularly after a milder traumatic brain injury [ 12 ] .
a wide array of factors have been proposed to explain the greater pain experience in mtbi in comparison to more severe brain injuries , including shorter recovery period secondary to prompter return to regular activities [ 13 ] , as well as increased awareness and perception of pain resulting from lesser severity or absence of loss of consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia following mtbi [ 14 ] .
while pain usually resolves within the first 3 months [ 15 ] , persistent symptoms including headaches , sleep disturbances , and fatigue have been reported in 5 % to 15 % of patients months to years following the head trauma [ 4 , 16 ] .
identifying which patients are most likely to be at risk of chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms is a difficult clinical challenge [ 17 ] .
recent findings have provided important insights into the clinical [ 18 , 19 ] , neurocognitive [ 20 ] , and rehabilitation [ 21 ] factors that influence mtbi outcome .
factors associated with postconcussion symptoms at 1 month included presence of a skull fracture , dizziness , and headache [ 22 ] , while level of education , lack of nausea or vomiting , and low levels of pain were associated with full return to work by 6 months [ 17 ] .
despite this progress , understanding the psychological processes that influence mtbi outcome represents an important and underrepresented area for further research [ 23 ] .
the objective of the present study was to examine the role of pain coping styles in mtbi outcome .
pain catastrophizing , defined as an exaggerated appraisal of the negative components of an actual or anticipated pain experience [ 24 , 25 ] , is a coping style characterized by three catastrophizing dimensions : rumination , magnification , and helplessness [ 25 ] .
literature findings have consistently demonstrated relationships between heightened pain and catastrophizing in both healthy asymptomatic individuals [ 25 - 27 ] and various patient groups [ 28 , 29 ] .
recent findings have demonstrated associations between catastrophizing and abnormal changes in brain morphology and function amongst migraine patients [ 30 ] .
catastrophizing has also been associated with illness behaviors such as frequency of visits to healthcare professionals and hospital stays [ 31 ] , as well as use of both hospital administered and over - the - counter primary medications [ 32 , 33 ] .
a relationship between catastrophizing and adverse clinical outcome has also been illustrated in patients with soft - tissue injuries [ 34 ] and fibromyalgia [ 35 ]. with respect to mtbi outcome , we hypothesized that higher levels of pain catastrophizing would be associated with greater severity of self - reported pain , greater number of postconcussion symptoms , increased psychological distress , decreased level of functionality , and higher risk of postconcussion syndrome .
we conducted a cross - sectional cohort study to test these hypotheses .
2. methods 2.1 .
participants a sample of 58 participants was recruited as part of a larger - scale study assessing sleep patterns and genotypical components of mtbi patients .
participants were recruited from those seen at the emergency department ( ed ) of an accredited specialized trauma centre in montreal , canada , and diagnosed with a mtbi .
mtbi diagnosis was established by a certified neurosurgeon based on the following task force criteria : state of consciousness , presence of posttraumatic amnesia , and glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) score [ 36 ] .
inclusion criteria consisted of any patient seen at the hospital for a day or more and whose posttrauma symptoms were not due to alcohol intoxication , illegal substance or medication , or other injuries ( systemic or facial lesions , intubations ) .
exclusion criteria included age < 18 years , language barrier , known history of mental retardation , previous history of tbi , previous diagnosis of dementia or learning disability impairing the patient 's cognitive and reasoning processes , or current coexisting neurological or psychiatric illness .
a trauma research nurse recruited participants between january 2006 and august 2010 .
during this time period , 2733 patients were seen in the ed and diagnosed with a mtbi. of these , 128 were recruited for study participation and 80 consented to participate ( 63 %) .
twenty - two participants were later excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria , voluntarily withdrew from the research protocol , or provided incomplete study data .
institutional ethics approval was granted for this study and all participants provided written consent .
2.2 .
measures 2.2.1 .
patient characteristics and medical history patient charts were reviewed for previous medical and surgical history and previous history of traumatic brain injury .
a systematic search targeted the following illnesses : sleep disturbances , chronic fatigue syndrome , psychiatric illness , and / or neurological impairment .
current medication intake , habits ( smoking , alcohol , and drug use ) , known allergies , data pertaining to the traumatic injury leading to the mtbi , and medical and / or surgical treatment received during the hospital stay were also recorded .
2.2.2 .
pain catastrophizing the 13 - item pain catastrophizing ( pc ) scale was used to measure pain catastrophizing [ 26 ] .
the scale asks participants to rate the frequency of catastrophizing thoughts or feelings ( 0 = not at all ; 4 = all the time ) .
the 13 catastrophizing items are further divided into 3 dimensions : magnification ( 3 items ) , rumination ( 4 items ) , and helplessness ( 6 items ) , a structure which has been replicated in other studies [ 37 ] .
magnification describes an excessive focus on the negative aspects of a pain experience and expectancies for a negative outcome (" i become afraid that the pain will get worse ") ; rumination refers to excessive worry and an inability to inhibit pain - related thoughts (" i cannot seem to keep it out of my mind ") ; and helplessness refers to a perceived inability to cope with a pain experience (" it 's awful and i feel that it overwhelms me ") .
internal consistency estimates range from alpha = . 66 for magnification to alpha = . 87 for total pc [ 26 ] .
2.2.3 .
postconcussion symptoms the 16 - item rivermead postconcussion symptoms questionnaire ( rpq ) was used to measure postconcussion symptoms [ 38 ] .
this scale asks participants to rate the degree to which postconcussion symptoms are more problematic in comparison to premorbid levels ( 0 = not experienced at all ; 4 = severe ) .
specific symptoms targeted include headaches , dizziness , nausea , noise sensitivity , sleep disturbance , fatigue , irritability , feeling depressed , frustration / impatience , forgetfulness , poor concentration , taking longer time to think , blurred vision , light sensitivity , double vision , and restlessness .
the rpq headache item was used as a measure of headache pain .
2.2.4 .
psychological distress and level of functionality the multidimensional pain inventory ( mpi ) scale was used to measure behavioral , cognitive , and emotional dimensions of living with pain [ 39 ] .
the mpi scale consists of three sections ( 52 items in total ) , which ask participants to rate how much their pain affects their lives , how others react to their communications of pain , and the frequency with which they participate in common daily activities .
the pain severity subscale ( 3 items ) was used as a measure of general pain severity (" how much suffering do you experience because of your pain ?") ; the affective distress subscale ( 3 items ) was used as a measure of psychological distress (" during the past week , how irritable have you been ?") ; and the general activities subscale ( 18 items ) was used as a measure of level of functionality , based on frequency of participation in household chores , outdoor work , activities away from home , and social activities .
internal consistency estimates range from alpha = . 70 to . 90 for all mpi scales [ 39 ] .
2.2.5 .
timing a trauma research nurse administered the rpq at 1 month after mtbi ( time 1 , mean = 33 days , response rate = 97 %) .
participants completed the mpi scale , the pc scale , and a second rpq at home within 6 - 8 weeks of their diagnosis and returned their completed questionnaires to the hospital by mail ( time 2 , mean = 55 days ) .
response rates ranged from 83 % for the second rpq to 100 % for the pc scale .
2.3 .
data analysis patient characteristics and medical history were analyzed descriptively .
relationships between pain catastrophizing and other time 2 measures ( pain severity , postconcussion symptoms , psychological distress , and level of functionality ) were assessed using pearson 's correlations ( r ) .
to assess whether pain catastrophizing may be a risk factor for the development of postconcussion syndrome , we first classified participants as being at either high or low risk for this condition .
postconcussion syndrome has been previously defined as the persistence of 3 or more symptoms following mtbi [ 40 ] .
as this definition lacks specificity to the tbi population [ 41 ] , we established a novel , more conservative definition .
participants who reported 6 or more rpq symptoms at a level of 2 , 3 , or 4 at both time 1 and time 2 were categorized as " high risk " for developing postconcussion syndrome , while participants who reported 5 or less symptoms at either time point were categorized as " low risk " for this condition .
student t - tests were used to compare the mean subscale and overall catastrophizing scores between high risk and low risk groups .
for all statistical tests , significance was defined as p < . 05 .
3. results 3.1 .
demographic and clinical characteristics patient characteristics are summarized in table 1 .
the mean patient age was 39.6 years ( min : 19 to max : 63 ) and 72 % ( 42 ) were men .
amnesia and loss of consciousness were confirmed in 17 % and 66 % of cases , respectively .
mean gcs scores recorded at initial evaluation ( at scene of trauma ) and at ed assessment were 13.9 / 15 and 14.5 / 15 , respectively .
mean length of stay at hospital was 3.88 days ( min : 1 to max : 25 ) .
the most frequent mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle accidents ( 35 %) and accidental falls ( 26 %) .
in 17 % of cases , the injury occurred in the patient 's work setting .
alcohol intoxication was confirmed or clinically suspected in 12 % of cases .
in addition to the mtbi , 36 % of patients sustained one or more concomitant injuries , including fracture ( 50 %) , contusion ( 14 %) , or laceration ( 19 %) .
thoracic ( 69 %) and facial ( 45 %) areas were the most common fracture locations .
pulmonary , myocardial , and thoracic contusions accounted for the majority of contusions recorded , in 7 % , 5 % , and 3.5 % of cases , respectively .
sustained lacerations were superficial in nature and localized in head and face locations in the majority of cases ( 73 %) .
a ct - scan was performed on 88 % of patients. of these , 54 % revealed abnormal findings , with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage ( 19 %) , hemorrhagic contusions ( 16 %) , and punctiform hematoma ( 13 %) being the most frequent radiological diagnoses .
the majority of patients ( 83 %) received one or more analgesics in hospital .
final prognosis was deemed favorable by a multidisciplinary team assessment in 90 % of patients , with the remainder being classified as unfavorable ( 4 %) or unspecified ( 7 %) .
following hospital discharge , most patients were sent home ( 95 %) , while the remainder were transferred to a rehabilitation facility .
3.2 .
pain catastrophizing and pain severity headache pain ( rpq headache ) at time 2 was associated with pc magnification ( r = . 35 , p = . 02 ) .
general pain at time 2 ( mpi pain severity ) was associated with pc rumination ( r = . 33 , p = . 02 ) , pc magnification ( r = . 31 , p = . 03 ) , pc helplessness ( r = . 44 , p < . 01 ) , and overall pc ( r = . 39 , p < . 01 ) .
3.3 .
pain catastrophizing and postconcussion symptoms the most frequently reported rpq postconcussion symptoms at time 1 were fatigue ( 70 %) , sleep disturbances ( 66 %) , dizziness ( 52 %) , headaches ( 50 %) , and reduced ability to concentrate ( 50 %) .
symptoms reported at time 2 included fatigue ( 69 %) , sleep disturbances ( 63 %) , reduced ability to concentrate ( 63 %) , and dizziness ( 60 %) ( table 2 ) .
rpq assessments at time 1 and time 2 were significantly correlated in terms of both total scores ( r = . 59 , p < . 001 ) and number of symptoms reported at a level of 2 or greater ( r = . 63 , p < . 001 ) .
the total number of postconcussion symptoms at both time points was significantly associated with all pain catastrophizing measures ( table 3 ) .
fifteen participants were classified as high risk for developing postconcussion syndrome ( 6 or more symptoms at both time 1 and time 2 ) and 31 participants were classified as low risk .
the high risk group had significantly higher scores for pc rumination , t 44 = - 2.50 , p = . 02 , and overall pc , t 44 = - 2.28 , p = . 03 , as well as a trend towards higher scores for pc helplessness , t 44 = - 1.98 , p = . 05 ( table 4 ) .
3.4 .
pain catastrophizing and psychological distress psychological distress ( mpi affective distress ) was positively associated with pc rumination ( r = . 57 , p < . 001 ) ; pc magnification ( r = . 65 , p < . 001 ) ; pc helplessness ( r = . 67 , p < . 001 ) ; and overall pc ( r = . 66 , p < . 001 ) .
3.5 .
pain catastrophizing and level of functionality level of functionality ( mpi general activities ) was negatively associated with pc rumination ( r = - . 29 , p = . 03 ) ; pc magnification ( r = - . 43 , p < . 001 ) ; pc helplessness ( r = - . 38 , p = . 004 ) ; and overall pc ( r = - . 37 , p = . 004 ) .
4. discussion to our knowledge , this is the first study to investigate pain catastrophizing ( pc ) in the context of traumatic brain injury .
our findings suggest that pc is associated with greater severity of pain ( both headache pain and general pain ) in the first 8 weeks following a mtbi .
this supports current evidence from various clinical settings that pain catastrophizing adversely contributes to the pain experience [ 30 , 32 , 33 , 42 ] .
also supporting the literature , we found pc to be associated with increased psychological distress [ 43 ] and reduced level of functionality [ 29 , 35 , 42 , 43 ] .
this study also contributes a novel finding that participants with high levels of pc reported a greater number of postconcussion symptoms and had a higher risk of postconcussion syndrome development at 8 weeks after mtbi .
these results add to the compelling evidence suggesting that coping strategies , including their cognitive appraisal processes , are related to one 's level of emotional distress [ 44 , 45 ] .
as formal diagnosis of postconcussion syndrome is not typically made until 3 months after injury [ 40 ] , our results also offer an avenue for early detection of patients at risk for chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms following mtbi .
further prospective studies are warranted to determine whether these relationships can also be observed at earlier time points .
if baseline catastrophizing tendencies were shown to predict mtbi outcome , the pc scale would have considerable promise as a screening tool in the ed , given that it is of low cost and easy to administer and interpret .
in turn , the early detection of pc tendencies might lead to the implementation of goal - oriented psychological interventions to prevent or minimize adverse outcomes [ 46 ] .
the necessity for such tailored , case - by - case treatment interventions has been previously reinforced [ 47 ] .
our study has potential limitations .
it was small in scale and conducted at a single institution .
despite compiling data on socioeconomic status , financial compensation , and work - related versus non - work - related head injury , our sample size was not sufficient to assess the potential role of these variables as predictors and / or cofactors .
further confirmatory studies are warranted , as these variables have been consistently related with slower recovery processes and unfavorable outcomes after mtbi [ 48 , 49 ] and may be differentially related to pain catastrophizing tendencies .
the self - reported nature of the clinical data also presents a limitation .
though evidence suggests that most patients can adequately recall numerous problematic experiences [ 50 ] , the potential contribution of recall bias or selective differences in post - mtbi symptom reports cannot be overlooked [ 51 ] .
objective measurement techniques can help to address this limitation .
for example , catastrophizing tendencies have been previously associated with abnormal changes to brain morphology and function , as measured on mri [ 30 ] .
a further direction of our work is to investigate the convergence of self - reported pain catastrophizing with physiological measures including brain imaging ( for anatomical integrity and electrical brain activity assessment ) , polygraphy ( for sleep and autonomic activation data ) , and blood sample collection ( for genetic composition evaluation ) .
5. conclusion the present study showed that pain catastrophizing tendencies are correlated with adverse early clinical outcome in patients who sustain a mtbi .
these results add to the evidence suggesting that maladaptive coping strategies are predictors of poor outcomes after traumatic injuries [ 43 ] .
moreover , our novel finding suggesting that pain catastrophizing is a risk factor for postconcussion syndrome development may facilitate early detection and intervention to prevent postconcussion syndrome .
future larger - scale studies are necessary to evaluate these factors at longer postinjury timeframes in order to optimize current mtbi treatment and improve patient outcomes .

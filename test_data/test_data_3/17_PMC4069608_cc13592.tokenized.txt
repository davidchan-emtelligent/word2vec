this study determined the pharmacokinetics and simulated pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin in icu patients during sled .
methods this study was a prospective evaluation of ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics in patients with sepsis and > 18 years of age , urine output < 200 ml / day and receiving sled for at least 8 hours .
following informed consent , plasma samples were collected at baseline and 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 hours after a ciprofloxacin 400 mg dose i.v. during sled and post - sled therapy at the same times .
dialysate samples were collected at 4 - hour intervals during sled .
pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using winnonlin and compared between the two periods .
simulated pharmacodynamic parameters were determined for pseudomonas aeruginosa using mic = 2 .
results a total of seven patients ( four male , three female , age 56.9 +/ - 7.6 , apache ii 26.8 +/ - 2.4 ) were enrolled .
ciprofloxacin was cleared relatively rapidly with a half - life of 6.9 hours and a ke of 0.108 / hour during sled compared with 11.9 hours and 0.057 / hour post - sled ( p < 0.05 ) .
simulated pharmacodynamics demonstrated inadequate coverage for p. aeruginosa during sled with cmax / mic ratio 5.7 +/ - 1.2 and auc / mic 77.5 +/ - 22.3 .
conclusion ciprofloxacin is rapidly cleared during sled similar to clearance during normal renal function , which may result in adequate pharmacodynamic coverage for some pathogens .

background given the scarcity of resources in developing countries , malaria treatment requires new strategies that target specific populations , time periods and geographical areas .
while the spatial pattern of malaria transmission is known to vary depending on local conditions , its temporal evolution has yet to be evaluated .
the aim of this study was to determine the spatio - temporal dynamic of malaria in the central region of burkina faso , taking into account meteorological factors .
methods drawing on national databases , 101 health areas were studied from 2011 to 2015 , together with weekly meteorological data ( temperature , number of rain events , rainfall , humidity , wind speed ) .
meteorological factors were investigated using a principal component analysis ( pca ) to reduce dimensions and avoid collinearities .
the box - jenkins arima model was used to test the stationarity of the time series .
the impact of meteorological factors on malaria incidence was measured with a general additive model .
a change - point analysis was performed to detect malaria transmission periods .
for each transmission period , malaria incidence was mapped and hotspots were identified using spatial cluster detection .
results malaria incidence never went below 13.7 cases / 10,000 person - weeks .
the first and second pca components ( constituted by rain / humidity and temperatures , respectively ) were correlated with malaria incidence with a lag of 2 weeks .
the impact of temperature was significantly non - linear : malaria incidence increased with temperature but declined sharply with high temperature .
a significant positive linear trend was found for the entire time period .
three transmission periods were detected : low ( 16.8 - 29.9 cases / 10,000 person - weeks ) , high ( 51.7 - 84.8 cases / 10,000 person - weeks ) , and intermediate ( 26.7 - 32.2 cases / 10,000 person - weeks ) .
the location of clusters identified as high risk varied little across transmission periods .
conclusion this study highlighted the spatial variability and relative temporal stability of malaria incidence around the capital ouagadougou , in the central region of burkina faso .
despite increasing efforts in fighting the disease , malaria incidence remained high and increased over the period of study .
hotspots , particularly those detected for low transmission periods , should be investigated further to uncover the local environmental and behavioural factors of transmission , and hence to allow for the development of better targeted control strategies .

given the scarcity of resources in the country , malaria treatment requires new strategies that target specific populations , time periods and geographical areas .
the world health organization ( who ) recommends implementing 2 sets of complementary interventions [ 3 ] : ( i ) universal strategies based on vector control , such as universal distribution of long - lasting insecticide - treated nets ( llins ) and universal access to rapid diagnosis and treatment in health facilities ( pillar 1 of the 2015 who malaria report ) ; and , ( ii ) locally tailored strategies that target vulnerable populations ( e.g. , chemoprevention in pregnant women and children under 5 years ) , and ones that target spatio - temporal malaria hotspots ( with a specific focus on parasites and vectors ) ( pillars 2 and 3 of the report ) .
for their part , yukich et al. recommend active case detection and prevalence surveillance at very precise levels of transmission [ 4 ] .
a number of studies have highlighted the importance of targeting high incidence areas and / or asymptomatic carriers to reduce malaria transmission [ 5 - 7 ] .
others have argued that insofar as spatial heterogeneity gradually increases with the decrease in transmission intensity , intervention programmes should be implemented during low transmission periods [ 8 ] .
in burkina faso , the current national policy is based on universal access to rapid diagnostic test ( rdt ) and artemisinin - based combination therapy ( act ) , and on universal distribution of llins [ 9 ] .
similar to the situation in other west african countries where malaria transmission is seasonal [ 10 ] , a strategy targeting children during high transmission periods was implemented in july 2016 in 50 out of 70 health districts ( covering a total of 10,874,840 inhabitants ) [ 11 ] .
each year , this seasonal malaria chemoprevention ( smc ) programme covers children aged 3 - 59 months from july to october [ 2 ] .
despite such efforts , the incidence of malaria remains high throughout burkina faso .
in view of this , malaria treatment requires new , targeted strategies that are based on spatio - temporal assessments of malaria transmission [ 4 ] .
in ouagadougou , the capital of burkina faso , a previous cross - sectional study ( 2004 ) investigating 8 out of 30 neighbourhoods showed that malaria incidence among children ( 6 - 12 years ) was heterogeneous and associated with lower economic or education levels , distance from hydrological areas , irregularly built - up areas , and lack of llin use [ 12 ] .
however , the dynamic of malaria transmission in the entire central region , including the capital city and the adjacent rural areas has to be explored .
in the context of seasonal control strategies , high and low transmission periods need to be properly defined , and the relationships between meteorological factors and onsets of the yearly epidemic need to be better understood , as this will make it possible to anticipate the transmission of the disease .
lastly , while the spatial pattern of malaria transmission is known to vary depending on local conditions , its temporal evolution has yet to be evaluated .
studies have shown that even at a very local scale , anopheles density and malaria incidence are heterogeneous and associated with spatial and temporal hotspots [ 8 , 13 , 14 ] .
consequently , hotspots should be thoroughly investigated to allow for the development of targeted control strategies [ 8 , 15 - 17 ] .
the aim of this study was to determine the spatio - temporal dynamic of malaria in the central region of burkina faso , taking into account meteorological factors .
methods the central region of burkina faso has a surface area of 2869 sq km , and includes the capital ouagadougou ( urban area ) along with 6 semi - urban or rural provincial departments .
in 2015 , the population of the region was 2,637,303 , representing 14.86 % of the national population , and its annual growth rate was 4.2 % [ 1 ] .
the region is divided into 101 health areas ( has ) distributed in 5 health districts ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 health area limits and locations of health facilities .
black lines correspond to the limits of the has ( thiessen polygons ) .
each green triangle represents the location of each health facility .
the top green rectangle is a zoom of the central urban area ( ouagadougou ) the global positioning system ( gps ) coordinates of each ha were extracted from the national health map [ 18 ] and confirmed by field investigations .
estimated population per ha was extracted from the yearly national action plan for each health district , based on the last census ( 2006 ) and the projection ( until 2016 ) released by the institut national de la statistique et de la demographie ( insd ) .
in burkina faso , data on malaria incidence can be obtained from 2 sources .
the first is the national epidemiological surveillance system , known as the telegramme lettre officiel hebdomadaire ( tloh ) .
in this system , has are required to provide weekly reports on 11 diseases ( including malaria ) to their respective health districts ; reported cases are then gathered and controlled by the health districts before being sent to the ministry of health .
the second is a national database known as ' bd - malaria ' , which focuses on malaria and is mainly aimed at facilitating the management of rdt and act .
this database publishes monthly reports on the number of malaria cases , rdt use , treatment stocks ( act ) , and the number of llins distributed to pregnant women .
it relies on the monthly reports provided by all health facilities of burkina faso .
in this study , malaria cases were extracted from the tloh database ( weekly ) and the bd - malaria database ( monthly ) for a 5 - year period ( 2011 / 1 / 3 - 2015 / 12 / 27 ) and for each ha. the 2 databases were compared to validate / correct the weekly number of cases .
weekly meteorological data were obtained from one meteorological station ( station de l'aeroport international de ouagadougou ) of the direction nationale de la meteorologie for the same study period .
the meteorological variables included were : weekly rainfall ( mm ) , the number of rain events per week , weekly averages of minimum and maximum daily temperature ( degreesc ) , weekly averages of minimum and maximum daily relative humidity (%) , and weekly averages of daily wind speed ( km / h ) .
to begin , meteorological factors were identified using a principal component analysis ( pca ) to reduce dimensions and avoid collinearities .
the stationarity of the malaria time series and that of the combined meteorological time series derived from the main components were determined with the box - jenkins arima modelling procedure ( seasonal auto - regressive integrated moving average ) [ 19 - 21 ] .
the lags between the stationary time series of malaria and the stationary time series of each meteorological factor were measured using cross - correlation functions .
second , the impact of the different meteorological factors on malaria incidence was assessed using a general additive model ( gam ) .
the latter included meteorological components ( presenting a significant cross - correlation after the time series was shifted by the time lag ) , seasonality and trends .
a negative binomial distribution was used to account for over - dispersion , and the log - transformed population count was used as an offset to estimate standardized incidence ratios [ 22 ] .
furthermore , spline smoothing was performed to capture the non - linear relationship between malaria incidence and combined meteorological factors .
third , a change - point analysis was conducted to detect high , low and intermediate transmission periods ( respectively , htp , ltp and itp ) .
the change - point analysis in mean and variance was performed using the pruned exact linear time algorithm ( pelt ) [ 23 ] .
for each transmission period derived from the change - point analysis , malaria incidence was mapped , and hotspots were identified using kulldorff 's spatial scan statistic .
the latter approach seeks to group the various neighbouring spatial units into potential clusters by moving a scanning window across the geographical region of interest .
the algorithm uses circular windows centred at each ha. potential clusters are defined for a radius ranging from 1 to 50 % of the population [ 24 ] .
the incidences were mapped at the health area scale .
currently , each health facility is associated with an administrative ha defined by the ministry of health .
the field investigation showed that these administrative boundaries were not relevant as inhabitants mainly accessed the closest health facility , and not the health facility administratively associated to their home .
using the gps of each health facility , the areas based on the thiessen polygon approach were estimated .
this approach allowed to propose a theoretical area associated with each health facility. between each point created , corresponding to each health facility , a bisector was drawn to delimit the ha of two adjacent health facilities .
each polygon represented the area around each health facility .
the variation in the ha size was explained by the density of health facilities , greater in central urban area than in rural / remote ones .
spatial cluster analysis was performed using satscan software version 9.4 ( information management services inc , silver spring , maryland , usa ) .
all other statistical analyses were performed using r v3.3.0 ( the r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) ( packages { mgcv }{ caschrono }{ factominer }{ forecast }) .
qgis software ( version 2.12.2 , open source geospatial foundation , boston , usa ) was used to provide maps .
figures were formatted with paint.net software ( v4.0.13 , warren paint & color co. , nashville , usa ) .
results overview of the time series from 2011 to 2015 , the malaria incidence time series revealed an association between classical seasonality and dry / rainy annual periodicity ( fig. 2 ) .
the highest incidences were observed between june and november .
beyond the classical seasonal pattern , a small rebound was observed just after each annual epidemic .
yet despite the implementation of national control policies during this period , no decreasing trend was observed .
moreover , malaria incidence never went below 13.7 cases / 10,000 person - weeks whatever the ha. fig. 2 weekly meteorological factors and malaria incidence from 2011 to 2015 .

the white / grey background ( upper panel ) represents the different transmission periods ( white for intermediate , light grey for low , and dark grey for high ) meteorological data and malaria incidence analysis combination of the meteorological factors allowed to identify 3 main components ( derived from the pca , representing 90.17 % of the inertia ) .
the first component ( 53.6 % of the inertia ) was constituted by rain ( rainfall amount and number of rain events ) and humidity ( maximum and minimum weekly averages ) .
minimal and maximal temperatures ( weekly averages ) were combined into the second component ( 22.16 % of the inertia ) .
the weekly average wind speed formed the third component ( 14.41 % of the inertia ) , see additional file 1 .
after stationarity , the first meteorological component ( rainfall , rain events , humidity ) was positively and significantly correlated with malaria incidence with a lag of 2 weeks ( correlation coefficient : 0.18 ) .
the second meteorological component ( minimum and maximum temperatures ) was negatively and significantly correlated with malaria incidence with a lag of 2 weeks ( correlation coefficient : - 0.13 ) .
the third component ( wind speed ) was not significantly correlated with malaria incidence .
the multivariate analysis ( gam modelling ) assessed the relationship between malaria incidence and the different meteorological components ( taking into account the time lag between them ) , explaining 75 % of the deviation .
it found a quasi - linear relationship with the first meteorological component ( rainfall , rain events , humidity ) , indicating a significant increase in malaria incidence ( p < 0.001 ; fig. 3a ) .
the impact of the second meteorological component ( minimum and maximum temperatures ) was significantly non - linear : malaria incidence increased with temperature but declined sharply with high temperature , indicating a negative impact of high temperature on malaria ( p < 0.001 ; fig. 3b ) .
a significant positive linear trend ( p < 0.001 ) was also found for the entire time period , indicating an overall increase in malaria incidence in the region ( fig. 3c ). fig. 3 relationship between malaria incidence and the first meteorological factor ( rainfall , rain events , humidity ) , the second meteorological component ( maximum and minimum temperatures ) , and time .
the continuous black curves represent adaptive smooth relationships of malaria incidence according to the first meteorological component ( a ) , the second meteorological component ( b ) , and time ( c ) , with a ci of 95 % ( dashed black curves ) spatial hotspot distribution the change point analysis performed on the malaria incidence time series allowed to identify 3 transmission periods : low , high , and intermediate ( table 1 , fig. 2 ) .

discussion this study highlighted the spatial variability and relative temporal stability of malaria incidence around the capital ouagadougou , in the central region of burkina faso .
despite increasing efforts in fighting the disease , malaria incidence remained high and increased over the study period .
the positive quasi - linear relationship between the first meteorological component ( rainfall , rain events , humidity ) and malaria was similar to that observed elsewhere .
studies have shown that small puddles of stagnant water exposed to the sun during the rainy season and the beginning of the dry / cold season are favourable to larvae development and mosquito survival in urban settings [ 25 - 28 ] .
in this study , no negative impact of strong rains ( which can destroy breeding sites ) was found [ 29 ] .
moreover , the lag of 2 weeks between the first meteorological component ( rainfall , rain events , humidity ) and malaria incidence was shorter than that reported in other countries assessing rainfall only ( a lag of 3 months was reported in mali [ 30 ] , and lags of 2 - 3 months were reported in ethiopia and east african highlands [ 28 , 31 ]) .
this may be due to the presence of permanent water bodies in the region ( with 5 dams ) and permanent agriculture areas that contribute to a constant presence of vectors at these locations .
this may explain the rapid onset of malaria incidence at the beginning of the rainy season .
furthermore , publications assessing the relationship between vegetation and malaria showed similar lags [ 32 - 35 ] .
this result could also be due to the analysis at the weekly scale ( and not at the monthly scale ) and by the use of combinations of meteorological factor ( using pca ) .
the impact of temperature on malaria incidence has also been highlighted in several studies [ 36 , 37 ] .
in the context of ethiopia [ 38 ] , peterson et al. identified a positive impact of minimum temperature on malaria incidence after a lag of 4 weeks .
entomological studies have stressed the negative impact of high temperature , which increases anopheles death rate [ 39 - 41 ] .
indeed , temperature influences the duration of larvae development , the incubation period of parasites and mosquito survival [ 27 , 37 , 42 ] .
accordingly , the results showed both a positive impact of decreasing temperatures and a negative impact of increasing temperatures on malaria incidence .
while previous studies have found a decreasing impact of wind speed on mosquito survival [ 43 - 45 ] , no significant relationship between wind speed and malaria incidence was observed .
this results may be due to the higher incidence rate and relatively low wind speeds observed .
in fact , during the harmattan period ( mainly november to march ) [ 46 ] , high wind speed is associated with drought and high temperatures , making it difficult to study the impact of wind speed independently from temperature and drought .
while the impact of meteorological factors on malaria incidence has been the focus of numerous studies , malaria is also caused by other factors , notably parasitaemia and human behaviour .
indeed , humans are the only reservoir of parasites , which means that sub - microscopic and asymptomatic carriage should be investigated for a better understanding of the dynamic of transmission [ 30 , 36 , 47 ] .
nevertheless , meteorological variables can be used to estimate and forecast malaria incidence , thereby providing public health decision - makers with a useful tool [ 48 ] .
most published studies ( e.g. [ 12 , 49 ]) describe 2 periods of malaria transmission. by contrast , 3 transmission periods were identified , which did not perfectly correspond to the climatic seasons of burkina faso ( hot - dry , rainy , cold - dry seasons ) .
htps lasted from june to december , whereas the rainy season usually lasts from april to october .
this lag should be kept in mind when implementing pre - traveller prevention strategies or programmes of smc and intermittent treatment and prevention during pregnancy .
the definition of hotspots by using the satscan method allowed to detect high - risk areas .
this method has been developed to detect spatial or space - time clusters of cases , for different distributions [ 50 - 52 ] , and for different cluster shapes [ 53 ] .
this scanning approach makes it possible to overcome the problem of the proximity matrix and the distance weighting function .
based on the likelihood ratio test and a monte carlo approach , it allows taking into account the problem of the multiplicity of tests ( unlike other scan methods ) [ 24 ] .
but the hotspots definition is relative to the overall incidence and not to particular high - risk places .
even if the method is not constrained by the scanning window shape , the circular or elliptic - shaped scanning window available within the software may impact the results in case of non - circular clusters or edge effects [ 54 ] .
this approach tends then to detect clusters that are too broad ( lack of specificity ) , by absorbing nearby spatial units [ 24 , 56 ] .
furthermore , the satscan performances decrease for low baseline incidences , low sizes of the at - risk population and for low relative risks [ 55 , 57 ] .
some hotspot locations varied little across the different transmission periods , indicating a relatively stable spatio - temporal pattern .
only the associated relative risks changed across transmission periods , though this was probably due to the method used to estimate these risks .
the specific ha of zeguedesse ( corresponding to hotspot ndegrees1 of the ltps and to hotspot ndegrees1 of the itps ) was at higher risk of malaria throughout the 5 - year period .
this may be partly explained by population growth .
indeed , the construction of a new hospital centre ( centre hospitalier universitaire blaise compaore ) in 2010 led to the destruction of the villages of bassemyam and dayoubsi ( 114 ha ) and to the re - housing of the population in zeguedesse .
the population growth that ensued may have prompted an increase in transmission intensity , and hence in the number of reported cases .
however , given that no population census has been conducted since 2010 , it may be that the population of zeguedesse was underestimated , thereby leading to overestimated incidences .
when the transmission periods were compared , 3 zones of particular interest were found .
the first zone was located in the southwestern part of the region , and included almost all rural areas of the boulmiougou health district .
hotspots ndegrees1 and 9 of the ltps ( fig. 4 ) were included in hotspot ndegrees3 of the htps ( fig. 4 ) , with risk ratios ( rrs ) increasing from 1.58 and 8.04 , respectively , for the ltps to 2.17 for the htps .
this zone also corresponded to hotspots ndegrees1 and 8 of the itps , which presented rrs of 8.28 and 1.72 , respectively .
second , a high - risk area was detected in the northern part of the region , with rrs of 2.01 , 2.86 and 1.92 for the ltps , htps , and itps , respectively ( figs. 4 , 5 , 6 ) , corresponding to hotspots ndegrees6 , 1 , and 5 .
third , a stable high - risk area was found in the southeastern part of the region , with rrs of 1.74 , 1.74 , and 1.75 for the ltps , htps , and itps , respectively ( figs. 4 , 5 , 6 ) , corresponding to hotspots ndegrees8 , 5 , and 7 .
in this zone , the location of hotspots ndegrees4 and 2 was the same for the ltps and the itps ( figs. 4 , 6 ) .
these 3 zones of interest are located in a similar environment .
indeed , there are 3 dams in the north of the capital , one dam in the southwest ( near boulmiougou ) , and one dam in the southeast ( near koubri ) .
furthermore , the eastern part of the region is characterized by the presence of the nakambe forest .
this specific environment may be associated with a higher risk of malaria because it is favourable to the development of anopheles breeding sites [ 58 - 61 ] .
conclusions despite increasing efforts to fight the disease , the incidence of malaria increased between 2011 and 2015 in the central region of burkina faso .
for each year of the study , 3 periods of malaria transmission were identified : all 3 periods were associated with relatively stable hotspots located in a similar environment ( dams ) .
the hotspots detected during the ltps had a higher incidence of malaria .
future studies should investigate these hotspots to uncover the local environmental and behavioural factors of transmission , as this would allow for the development of better - targeted control strategies .
for this purpose , a real - time monitoring system should be implemented based on the existing national monitoring system .

the expression levels of the two novel oncoproteins uridine - cytidine kinase like - 1 ( uckl - 1 ) and mitochondrial ribosomal protein s18 - 2 ( mrps18 - 2 ) were assessed in samples of hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) - associated hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) using immunohistochemistry .
tissue microarray ( tma ) paraffin blocks were prepared from 42 hcc tumor samples with the corresponding peri - tumor tissues and from 11 tissues of a liver with hcv - induced cirrhosis .
we found that the uckl - 1 signal in the liver tissues of the peri - tumor zone in the hcc samples was stronger than that in cirrhosis ( 50 +/ - 49.44 vs. 24.27 +/ - 14.53 ; p = 0.014 ) .
the mrps18 - 2 expression was weak , and there was no differences between the groups ( p = 0.26 ) .
noteworthy , the uckl - 1 protein was expressed at higher levels in peri - tumor tissues in the cases of hcc recurrence ; this was confirmed for 27 older patients ( 63.78 +/ - 9.22 vs. 53.53 +/ - 4.07 years , p < 0.001 ) , in parallel with enhanced uckl - 1 staining in former hcc nodules ( 62.69 +/ - 50.4 vs. 26.0 +/ - 30.19 , p = 0.006 ) and microvascular invasion ( p = 0.02 ) .
a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for hcc recurrence showed that the best predictive factors for these conditions were uckl - 1 expression in tumor , vascular invasion , and hcc treatment modality , other than liver transplantation ( odds ratios : 1.029 , 18.143 and 11.984 , r2 = 0.633 , p = 0.002 ) .
in conclusion , the high uckl - 1 expression might be a prognostic factor for hcc relapse , in combination with age and microvascular invasion .
mrps18 - 2 protein expression has no prognostic significance in the cases of hcv - associated hcc .
hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma uckl - 1 mrps18 - 2 prognostic factors introduction liver cancer ( predominantly hcc ) is the second - most deadly cancer for men worldwide [ 1 ] .
hcc incidence in nordic countries , including lithuania , reaches up to 10 / 100,000 inhabitants [ 2 ] .
in developed countries , one factor that is responsible for the increased hcc incidence is hcv [ 3 ] .
in lithuania , anti - hcv prevalence in adults stands at about 2.78 % [ 4 ] .
hcv - induced hcc development is a multi - step process that may last 20 - 40 years and involves chronic hepatic inflamma tion , progressive liver fibrosis , initiation of neoplastic clones , and tumor progression in a carcinogenic tissue microenvironment [ 5 ] .
noteworthy , eradication of hcv reduces , but does not eliminate , the risk of hcc development , especially when advanced hepatic fibrosis has already originated [ 6 , 7 ] .
it becomes difficult then and hardly manageable to follow patients at early - stage asymptomatic hcv - induced cirrhosis .
thus , it was discovered in a population - based study that less than 20 % of patients with cirrhosis who had developed hcc were subject to regular monitoring [ 8 ] .
therefore , prognostic markers are now being actively developed to stratify hcv patients into clearly defined risk groups .
successful employ of these predictors in clinical practise could improve the clinical management of these patients [ 9 ] .
additionally , even with a successful hcc treatment by liver transplantation , liver resection , or radiofrequency - induced thermotherapy ( rfitt ) , high risk of hcc recurrence persists [ 7 , 8 ] .
the recurrence rate of hcc is estimated at 70 % after 5 years of liver resection [ 10 ] .
the validated prediction markers of recurrence are the tumor size , multifocality , macroscopic and microscopic vascular invasion , as well as poor differentiation [ 11 ] .
it is widely accepted that malignant transformation of liver cells is stimulated by various factors .
however , studies on the mechanisms of hcv - induced cell transformation are inhibited by the lack of animal and cell models .
obviously , better understanding of molecular mechanisms would help us identify new diagnostic and / or prognostic markers , most importantly , for the early detection of hcc [ 11 ] .
this would allow us to develop better approaches to clinical treatment .
usually , the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for virus - induced cell transformation include the inactivation of the two tumor suppressor protein pathways : i.e. , the p53 ( tp53 ) and retinoblastoma ( rb ) pathways [ 12 , 13 ] .
there is little doubt that other proteins can play an important role in cell transformation : for example , the putative human enzyme uckl - 1 that is involved in cellular nucleotide metabolism [ 14 , 15 ] and the new oncoprotein mrps18 - 2 that can bind rb [ 13 , 16 , 17 ] .
there are no data on the expression of both of these proteins in hcc , and we asked ourselves the question of whether the uckl - 1 and mrps18 - 2 expressions in hcc tissues could be used as prognostic markers for the course of the disease in hcv - bearing patients .
experimental patient samples the retrospective cohort study was conducted at vilnius university hospital santariskiu klinikos , vilnius , lithuania , according to the guidelines of the helsinki declaration .
the study was approved by the vilnius regional biomedical research ethics committee ( 158200 - 13 - 698 - 224 , from 2013 - 11 - 12 ) .
the hcc tumor and the corresponding peri - tumor ( normal ) liver tissue samples were collected from 53 patients who had undergone liver transplantation , liver resection , or rfitt for a complicated chronic hcv infection .
tissue sections from 42 hcv positive cirrhotic patients with hcc and 11 samples from transplanted hcv cirrhotic patients without hcc , as a control group , were analyzed .
all the specimens are preserved at the national lithuanian center of pathology .
a histological activity index ( hai ) was scored , according to k. ishak et al. , and liver fibrosis was assessed , according to metavir [ 18 - 20 ] .
in hcc cases , tumor differentiation and microvascular invasion were evaluated .
analysis of uckl - 1 and mrps18 - 2 expression in hcc and liver tissue specimens tissue samples after surgery , hepatic resection , and / or liver transplantation were fixed in a buffered 10 % formalin solution .
expression of the uckl - 1 and mrps18 - 2 proteins was performed by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) on tissue microarrays ( tmas ) constructed of paraffin - embedded tissues , selected by the pathologist .
cores one millimeter in diameter were punched from the selected areas .
paraffin sections of the tmas were cut ( 2 mum thick ) , dewaxed , deparaffinized , and rehydrated .
epitopes were heat - activated in a envision flex target retrieval solution for 20 min , while the ph of the buffer was low for uckl - 1 and high for mrps18 - 2 .
the samples were cooled at room temperature for 15 min .
a two - step ihc procedure was performed with the envision flex detection system ( dako ) , using an automatic staining link instrument ( dako ) .
the primary anti - uckl - 1 ( diluted 1 : 200 ) and anti - mrps18 - 2 ( diluted 1 : 150 ) antibodies ( sigma - aldrich ) were applied for 60 and 30 min , respectively .
the secondary antibody flex / hrp ( dako ) was applied for 20 min .
the peroxidase enzyme was then visualized with 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine , tetrahydrochloride , and hydrogen peroxide .
hematoxylin was used as a counterstain for 10 min .
visual evaluation of the uckl - 1 and mrps18 - 2 signals was performed by an experienced pathologist .
each spot was graded individually .
the uckl - 1 and mrps18 - 2 cytoplasmic reactions were considered as negative if no positive cells were observed .
if a mrs18 - 2 signal was detected mainly in the perinuclear cytoplasm , this was noted in the table of results , as well .
the results of ihc reactions were evaluated semiquantitatively , by counting the number of positively stained cells in 1,000 analysed cells as a specified percentage - a label index ( li %) .
li values lower than the median expression of the marker were considered as low , and if a li value overran the median expression it was considered as high .
in addition , demographic information ( age , body mass index ( bmi ) , gender ) , laboratory data on the hcv infection ( hcv genotype ( gt )) , the cumulative size of hcc assessed radiologically , the hcc treatment modality ( liver transplantation , liver resection or rfitt ) , and the time period of follow - up were evaluated for each patient .
statistics a statistical analysis was performed using the ibm spss 19.0 statistical program .
the kolmogorov - smirnov test was used to assess data normality .
group differences were determined using the student t test when data distribution was normal : in other cases , the mann whitney and the kruskal - wallis criteria were used .
chi2 tests were conducted for the categorical variables .
to establish a connection between categorical variables , the spearman correlation coefficient was calculated .
a logistic regression model was constructed in order to investigate the association between the intensity of the uckl - 1 and mrps18 - 2 signals in the hcc and microvascular invasion , the hcc treatment modality , and hcc recurrence after treatment .
all hypotheses were verified with a selected significance level of p < 0.05 .

forty - two out of the 53 patients had developed the hcv - associated hcc and received treatment ; 11 patients were diagnosed only with hcv - induced cirrhosis .
all participants were followed up for at least 1 year at the santariskiu klinikos of vilnius university hospital ; the hcc patients were observed for about 2.82 +/ - 1.76 years ; and the patients with hcv - induced cirrhosis - for 5.27 +/ - 2.49 years .
noteworthy , the hcc patients were significantly older than the individuals with cirrhosis ( p = 0.001 ) : the mean age of the hcc patients was 60.1 +/ - 9.29 years , while the persons in the cirrhosis group were about 49.42 +/ - 9.29 years old .
no differences in gender distribution ( male / female ratio ) in hcc and non - hcc ( cirrhosis ) groups were detected ( p = 0.917 ) .
the bmi value was also similar in these groups ( p = 0.774 ) ( see table 1 ) .
table 2 histological and immunohistochemical differences in liver tissue samples in groups characteristics hcc ( n = 42 ) non - hcc ( n = 11 ) p - value hai,mean +/ - sd 6.71 +/ - 1.49 6.64 +/ - 2.34 0.892 uckl - 1,mean +/ - sd , li (%) 50 +/ - 49.44 24.27 +/ - 14.53 0.014 mrps18 - 2,mean +/ - sd , li (%) 8.68 +/ - 16.61 15.00 +/ - 15.17 0.260 all participants had histologically confirmed advanced fibrosis , and hai did not differ between the hcc and non - hcc groups ( p = 0.892 ) ( table 2 ). fig. 1 the uckl - 1 expression in the liver tissue .
notice the significant increase in the uckl - 1 staining in samples with hcc in comparison with patients with cirrhosis without hcc the expression of uckl - 1 was high in the liver tissues of patients with hcc .
we found that the uckl - 1 signal was stronger in the peri - tumoral liver tissue in hcc cases , compared with non - hcc ( cirrhosis ) cases ( 50 +/ - 49.44 vs. 24.27 +/ - 14.53 , p = 0.014 ) , as is presented in table 2 and fig. 1 and fig. 2. fig. 2 the uckl - 1 cytoplasmic expression in liver tissue .
notice that the uckl - 1 cytoplasmic signal was significantly lower in the hepatocytes ( expression was observed in 40 % of the cells ) of a cirrhosis patient ( a ) in comparison with the uckl - 1 signal in 100 % of the peri - tumor hepatocytes of a hcc patient ( b ) .
objective x40 on the contrary , the mrps18 - 2 signal was observed rarely in the liver tissue and this low expression did not differ between the groups ( p = 0.26 ) ( see table 2 ) .
a description of the cohort of patients with hcc relapse hcc recurrence in patients with hcv - induced cirrhosis after curative treatment ( liver transplantation , liver resection or rfitt ) was confirmed radiologically in 27 of 42 patients .
all patients were observed for at least 1 year before the diagnosis of hcc relapse ( the mean observation time was 2.93 +/ - 2.43 ) ( see table 3 ) .
hcc relapse appeared usually after 2.76 +/ - 1.3 years .
the recurrence rate ( 62 %) in the studied cohort and the time of relapse were similar to those reported earlier by other authors [ 10 ] .
moreover , the mortality rate in the relapsers was significantly higher than that in non - relapsers ( 59.3 and 6.7 % , respectively , p = 0.001 ) ( see table 3 ) .
table 3 characteristics of patient groups with and without hcc recurrence characteristics hcc recurrence ( n = 27 ) no hcc recurrence ( n = 15 ) p - value follow up , mean +/ - sd , years 2.76 +/ - 1.3 2.93 +/ - 2.43 0.8 lethality , count ( rate , %) 16 ( 59.3 ) 1 ( 6.7 ) 0.001 age , mean +/ - sd , years 63.78 +/ - 9.22 53.53 +/ - 4.07 < 0.001 gender , count ( rate , %) : - women / men 14 ( 51.9 %)/ 13 ( 48.1 %) 2 ( 13.3 %)/ 13 ( 86.7 %) 0.015 bmi average +/ - sd , kg / m2 27.05 +/ - 4.88 25.3 +/ - 4.01 0.245 hcc treatment method : - resection , count ( rate , %) - rfitt , count ( rate , %) - transplantation , count ( rate , %) 20 ( 74.1 ) 6 ( 22.2 ) 1 ( 3.7 ) 6 ( 40 ) 1 ( 6.7 ) 8 ( 53.3 ) 0.001 importantly , the age of the patients in both groups differed significantly : 63.78 +/ - 9.22 years in those that showed a relapse and 53.53 +/ - 4.07 years in non - relapsers ( p < 0.001 ) ( see table 3 ) .
noteworthy , women were diagnosed with hcc relapse more often than men : 87.5 % ( 14 out of 16 ) and 50 % ( 13 out of 26 ) , respectively ( p = 0.015 ) ( see table 3 ) .
however , an absolutely larger number of men were diagnosed with hcc ( 26 men versus 16 women ) .
it had also been reported earlier that older age and male gender are associated with an increased risk of hcc development in hcv cirrhotic patients [ 21 , 22 ] .
in our studied cohort of patients , no differences in bmi values , hai , and hcc differentiation were detected between the groups of relapsers and non - relapsers ( table 3 ) .
we have to mention that , in the studied cohort , there were only two cases of poorly differentiated hcc ( grade g3 ) in the group of relapsers and no g3 cases in the non - relapsers .
probably , this is one reason why in our case the histological differentiation grade was not associated with hcc recurrence , contrary to published data [ 23 ] .
table 4 histological differences in liver tissue samples in hcc recurrence and non - hcc recurrence groups characteristics hcc recurrence ( n = 27 ) no hcc recurrence ( n = 15 ) p - value hai , mean +/ - sd , count 6.89 +/ - 1.19 6.4 +/ - 1.92 0.381 hcc size , mean +/ - sd , mm 50.44 +/ - 17.831 41.47 +/ - 20.757 0.558 hcc grade of differentiation - g1 , count ( rate , %) - g2 , count ( rate , %) - g3 , count ( rate , %) 6 ( 23.07 ) 18 ( 69.23 ) 2 ( 7.69 ) 1 ( 6.67 ) 14 ( 93.33 ) 0 ( 0 ) 0.64 vascular invasion , count ( rate , %) 13 ( 50 ) 2 ( 13.33 ) 0.02 when microvascular invasion was observed , hcc recurrence was diagnosed significantly more often ( p = 0.02 , table 4 ) .
as a rule , tumors were larger in hcc relapsers ( 50.44 +/ - 17.83 mm vs. 41.47 +/ - 20.76 mm ) , but these differences were not statistically significant ( table 4 ) .
thus , in our study the microvascular invasion , proven histologically , was an independent predictive factor of a lower disease - free survival rate .
actually , tumor size and vascular invasion are well - known predictive factors of hcc recurrence [ 24 , 25 ] .
the studied cohort in the present paper was rather small , and that could be the reason why the size of the hcc nodules did not differ significantly between relapsers and non - relapsers , even when such a trend was observed .
the high expression of uckl - 1 and mrps18 - 2 in hcc tissues fig. 3 the uckl - 1 and mrps18 - 2 expression pattern in cancer tissues .
notice that the uckl - 1 cytoplasmic signal was significantly higher in the hcc samples of relapsers ( a ) in comparison with the uckl - 1 signal in non - relapsing hcc ( b ) .
the mrps18 - 2 signal was strong in cancer tissues , regardless relapsing ( c ) or non - relapsing ( d ) hcc .
objective x40 comparing the expression of uckl - 1 and mrps18 - 2 proteins in hcc nodules , a significantly stronger uckl - 1 signal was observed in hcc relapsers compared with non - relapsers : 62.69 +/ - 50.4 and 26.0 +/ - 30.19 , respectively ( p = 0.006 ) .
we have to emphasize that , at the same time , in the peri - tumor liver tissue no dramatic differences in uckl - 1 staining were detected when relapsers and non - relapsers were compared ( fig. 3 and table 5 ) .
hence , the uckl - 1 expression levels might have a prognostic value in terms of hcc occurrence and recurrence .
table 5 immunohistochemical differences in liver tissue samples in groups of patients with and without hcc recurrence characteristics hcc recurrence ( n = 27 ) no hcc recurrence ( n = 15 ) p - value uckl - 1 , mean +/ - sd , li (%) 49 +/ - 32.44 50.27 +/ - 14.53 0.510 mrps18 - 2 in liver tissue , mean +/ - sd , li (%) 9.42 +/ - 18.239 7.40 +/ - 13.835 0.583 uckl - 1 in hcc nodule , mean +/ - sd , li (%) 62.69 +/ - 50.4 26 +/ - 30.19 0.006 mrps18 - 2 in hcc nodule , mean +/ - sd , li (%) 78.08 +/ - 54.54 61.67 +/ - 60.52 0.378 at the same time , the mrps18 - 2 expression was several folds greater in the hcc nodules than in the unaffected liver , but no differences were observed between hcc relapsers and non - relapsers ( table 5 ) .
therefore , the levels of mrps18 - 2 could be considered as lacking prognostic significance for patients with hcv cirrhosis .
the high expression of uckl - 1 in hcc nodules can be a prognostic factor of hcc relapse as was expected based on the data published earlier [ 26 ] , the method of hcc treatment on its own had a significant predictive value of hcc recurrence : in the case of liver transplantation , the hcc recurrence rate was significantly lower than that after liver resection or rfitt - the were the only cases of hcc recurrence after liver transplantation ( table 3 ) .
the high rate of tumor recurrence after surgical resection and rfitt corresponded to the data in the literature [ 27 ] .
table 6 logistic regression characteristics b se wald dv p - value exp ( b ) uckl - 1 in hcc 0.029 0.013 5.022 1 0.025 1.029 vascular microinvasion 2.898 1.176 6.072 1 0.014 18.143 hcc treatment modality ( transplantation - > resection - > rfitt ) 2.484 0.933 7.084 1 0.008 11.984 constant - 6.316 2.178 8.413 1 0.004 0.002 note .
b - regression coefficient , se - standard error , wald - wald statistics value , dv - the dependent variable ( 1 - for hcc recurrence ) , exp ( b ) - odds ratio .
after a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for hcc recurrence was performed , we could conclude that the most significant variables were the levels of uckl - 1 expression in tumor nodes , vascular invasion , and the modality of the primary hcc treatment ( other than liver transplantation ) with odds ratios of 1.029 , 18.143 , and 11.984 , respectively ( r2 = 0.633 , p = 0.002 ) ( table 6 ) .
as has already been mentioned , the expression levels of mrs18 - 2 and the differentiation of hcc could not be predictive factors for hcc relapse .
thus , the addition of the expression levels of uckl - 1 as a predictive factor for the risk of hcc relapse resulted in a better prognosis of the course of the disease .
a higher uckl - 1 expression in hcc nodules can be indicative of a higher risk of hcc relapse after curative treatment , especially if the treatment was not liver transplantation .
mrs18 - 2 was expressed at significantly higher levels in hcc nodules , compared with normal liver tissues , but it was not predictive of hcc recurrence .
these promising results regarding the prognostic value of uckl - 1 in terms of hcc occurrence and recurrence should be confirmed in a larger prospective - retrospective clinical study .
conclusions a high level of uckl - 1 expression in hcc nodules , in combination with microvascular invasion and hcc treatment modality ( other , than liver transplantation ) , is a predictor of a higher risk of hcc recurrence .

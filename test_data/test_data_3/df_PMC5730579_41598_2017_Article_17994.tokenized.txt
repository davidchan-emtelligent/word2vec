pharmacotherapy provision based on nicotine metabolite ratio ( nmr ) status ( slow / normal metabolism ) may improve smoking cessation rates .
however , it is unclear whether nmr status is consistent across patient characteristics and current treatment choice .
data come from 1,826 participants attending stop smoking services ( sss ) across england in 2012 / 13 .
sociodemographic , mental / physical health , smoking and treatment characteristics ( nicotine replacement therapy vs. other pharmacotherapy ; group vs. one - to - one behavioural support ) were assessed .
salivary nicotine metabolites were measured and nmr ( 3 - hydroxycotinine / cotinine ) computed , characterising smokers as slow ( nmr < 0.31 ) or normal ( nmr >= 0.31 ) metabolisers .
normal metabolisers were older than slow metabolisers ( odds ratio ( or ) = 1.49 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) = 1.32 - 1.69 ) but no other characteristics were associated with nmr status .
overall , predictors accounted for only 7.3 % of nmr variance .
in adjusted analysis , pharmacotherapy type was not associated with nmr status , but normal metabolisers were less likely to use group support ( or = 0.67 , 95 % ci = 0.51 - 0.89 ) .
nmr status does not vary substantially across sociodemographic characteristics .
given its impact on pharmacotherapy efficacy , the lack of an association with pharmacotherapy choice suggests there is scope to use nmr status to optimise the selection and efficacy of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy .
the unexpected association of nmr status with behavioural support should be explored further .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction tobacco use remains a major global health and economic burden , resulting in the premature death of 78,000 smokers in england every year1 .
the principal aim of the national health service 's ( nhs ) ' stop smoking services' ( sss ) is to provide high - quality , evidence - based smoking cessation interventions to smokers seeking treatment2 .
while approximately 270,000 quit dates are being set each year through these services alone3 , current co - validated 4 - week cessation rates are 36 % 1 , highlighting a need for improvement .
an emerging method for improving cessation outcomes is the personalisation of treatment based on validated biomarkers4 .
one such biomarker is the nicotine metabolite ratio ( nmr ) - a phenotypic surrogate of nicotine clearance5 .
nicotine is predominantly metabolised by the liver enzyme cyp2a66 into cotinine , and subsequently exclusively by cyp2a6 into 3'hydroxycotinine7 .
as 3 - hydroxycotinine is formation dependent and cotinine has a long half - life , among regular smokers the ratio of 3'hydroxycotinine to cotinine - the nmr - is stable , and independent of time of last cigarette8 .
due to the prominent role of cyp2a6 in nicotine clearance , the nmr is also a biomarker of total nicotine clearance5 .
the nmr is stable over time8 - 10 , and multiple clinical trials have identified differential quit rates for different pharmacotherapies among normal or fast compared with slower metabolisers11 - 15 .
as nmr incorporates both genetic and environmental influences , it provides a surrogate of nicotine clearance which extends beyond cyp2a6 genotypic measures16 .
it can also be analysed relatively easily from plasma or saliva samples and therefore holds potential clinical utility as a predictive biomarker for cessation outcomes17 .
the clinical utility of nmr may be further understood through examination of its effectiveness , accessibility , and appropriateness within clinical practice18 .
nmr status ( dividing smokers into slow vs. normal metabolisers ) has recently been used to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of varenicline versus nicotine patch smoking cessation treatment15 .
varenicline , compared with nrt , was associated with an increased quit rate among normal but not among slow metabolisers15 .
lower abstinence rates have also been observed in retrospective analyses of fast or normal metabolisers , compared with slower metabolisers , with the use of nrt patch11,12,14,19 .
in addition , normal compared with slow metabolisers display lower quit rates with behavioural counselling alone13,20 .
such studies suggest that personalising cessation treatment using the nmr status may be an efficacious and appropriate method of improving the success of attempts to stop smoking .
however , the selection of smoking cessation treatment in naturalistic settings has not yet been explored in relation to nmr status .
while nrt aims to reduce withdrawal symptoms by substituting the nicotine source21 , varenicline both reduces nicotine craving and blocks the rewarding effects of smoking22 .
given that higher nmr has been associated with greater cigarette craving19 and withdrawal during a quit attempt23,24 , it is possible that smokers are self - selecting the most appropriate cessation aid. that is , over several quit attempts , smokers may learn which pharmacotherapy benefits them most , or stop smoking advisors may already recommend the most appropriate treatment based on characteristics associated with nmr , such as dependence .
further understanding of smokers' current treatment use would therefore facilitate our understanding of the potential efficacy of the nmr as a biomarker for personalising cessation treatment .
for example , as normal metabolisers show greater cessation rates with the use of varenicline , versus nicotine patch15 , a null association between nmr and treatment choice would suggest that attaining a pre - treatment measure of nmr might improve the selection of - and therefore efficacy of - pharmacological smoking cessation treatment .
in order to further assess the potential suitability of nmr within clinical practice , the reliability of the biomarker with a proposed cut - off to identify slow and normal metabolisers must be considered .
while a number of factors , including age25,26 , ethnicity27,28 , sex29 , and nicotine dependence30 have been associated with inter - individual variability in nmr , no studies have looked at the association of these factors with nmr status ( slow vs normal ) and only one clinical trial has explored the association between nmr ( but again not nmr status ) and multiple sources of variation simultaneously16 .
this is important as any treatment offered will depend on classification into nmr status ( e.g. slow vs. normal ) and if such characteristics significantly impacted nmr status , this would undermine its clinical utility as an independent marker of treatment success across a range of socio - demographic confounders .
as with other clinical markers , an appropriate cut - off point would distribute these characteristics evenly across categories .
moreover , associations with continuous nmr may be statistically significant but not clinically meaningful and in practice vary little by dichotomous nmr status .
so far , a range of demographic and environmental factors were found to have little impact on nmr variation , supporting the feasibility of the biomarker as a prospective guide for pharmacological treatment .
replication and extension of these findings in other populations ( treatment - seeking smokers ) and geographic locations using nmr status is now required .
for instance , the association of nmr with mental health status has yet to be explored , despite the increased prevalence of smoking within populations with mental health conditions31 .
in a large sample of treatment seekers in the uk , the present study therefore aimed to : characterise nmr and nmr status in terms of its association with sociodemographic , smoking , health - related , and treatment characteristics and , explore the relationship between nmr status and treatment choice for smoking cessation , including pharmacotherapy .
materials and methods participants and procedure data from the ' evaluating long - term outcomes of nhs stop smoking services' ( elons ) study , a prospective observational examination of 3,045 participants accessing sss , were used .
participants were recruited between march 2012 and march 2013 from nine regions across england .
all participants provided informed consent to take part in this study .
further details regarding the methodology can be found elsewhere32 .
eligible participants consisted of sss clients who were not pregnant , were aged 16 or above , and who were willing to provide a saliva sample before cessation treatment began .
additional funding was attained to collect saliva samples upon registration with the sss33 .
the majority of participants ( 61.6 % , n = 1,875 ) provided a saliva sample .
those providing a sample were younger , less likely to be female , white british or choose varenicline32 .
they were also more likely to choose group behavioural support .
there were no other demographic or treatment differences .
saliva samples , sociodemographic , smoking , health - related , and treatment characteristics were recorded by nhs sss staff prior to treatment .
saliva samples were collected on the first clinic visit , prior to setting a quit date , with sarstedt salivettes ( r ) , posted to university college london and stored in - 20 degreesc freezers .
saliva samples were subsequently shipped to the university of toronto ( n = 1,626 ) or abs laboratory ( n = 249 ) for analysis .
as an interlaboratory comparison of 100 randomly selected samples assayed at both laboratories showed very high correlation ( rho = 0.91 ) , results from both labs were pooled in this analysis .
ethical approval for the study was provided by the south east scotland research ethics committee ( 11 / al / 0256 ) and research complied with the ethical principles on human research , as per the declaration of helsinki .
measures sociodemographic measures age , sex , ethnicity , and socioeconomic status ( ses ) were assessed using the elons prospective study baseline data collection questionnaire32 .
due to the limited number of participants from ethnic minority groups , a binary split was used to compare those identifying as white british to all other ethnicities .
the reduced national statistics socio - economic classification ( nssec ) was used as a measure of ses .
this conceptualises social class based on occupation / employment status and has been validated in a number of uk samples34 , and as a predictor of smoking cessation success35 .
ses was further grouped into higher vs. lower ses , using the nssec coding abc1 / c2de ( managerial occupations / manual and unemployed ) .
smoking characteristics nicotine dependence was measured using the heaviness of smoking index ( hsi ) ; a measure of time to first cigarette and cigarettes per day36 .
participants with a score >= 4 ( out of 6 ) , were classified as having high dependence and compared with those with low dependence (< 4 ) 37 .
determination to quit was measured using one item rated with a 4 - point likert scale ( ranging from ' not at all determined ' to ' extremely determined ') and participants were also asked if they had attempted to quit in the past 12 months ( yes / no ) .
health - related measures physical health was assessed using one item ; participants selected any applicable medical conditions .
those with at least one medical condition were coded as having poorer physical health , compared with those without .
psychological wellbeing was measured using the who - 5 wellbeing index38 .
the scale has been credited with reasonable validity , as a method of assessing depression and as an outcome for clinical trials39 .
participants were scored on a scale of 1 - 25 ( 25 representing the highest quality of life ) , and scores were multiplied by 4 to attain a percentage .
a score <= 50 % was used to indicate low subjective wellbeing39 .
stop smoking service given the likely relationship between treatment choice and sss location40 , this was recorded by the relevant practitioners during baseline data collection .
for ease of interpretation sss were divided into north , midlands and south regions of england .
nicotine metabolite ratio saliva samples were analysed for cotinine ( cot ) and trans - 3 ' - hydroxycotinine ( 3hc ) levels using an established lc - ms / ms methodology with a 1 ng / ml limit of quantification ( loq ) 17,41 .
the nmr ratio of 3hc / cot was then determined .
the ratio has been shown to remain stable over time of day8 , over a period of months10 and while contemplating quitting9 .
data were examined for analytical shift and reliability , using a reanalysis of samples from each batch ( approximately 5 % of samples ) .
nmr between replicate analyses was highly correlated ( r2 = 0.984 ) , there was no association between change in nmr and time between analyses ( r2 = 0.004 ) and the percent of difference between analysis replicates varied by less than 10 % .
samples with cotinine values below 10 ng / ml were excluded as they likely reflect occasional or light smokers , where the nmr may be unstable .
for samples in which cot was above 10 ng / ml , and 3hc was below the limit of quantification , as per convention , the 3hc value was replaced by a dummy value of 0.71 ( loq / sqrt2 ) and included in the nmr ( i.e. nmr = 0.71 / cot ) 42 .
as plasma and salivary nmr are highly correlated5 , we used a cut - off for plasma nmr from a previous clinical trial based on population data15 to stratify participants into normal ( nmr >= 0.31 ) or slow ( nmr < 0.3 ) salivary metabolising status .
treatment characteristics as this was an observational study , participants were free to choose their treatment after consultation with a sss practitioner .
the elected pharmacotherapy and behavioural support type were recorded by the practitioner .
pharmacotherapy was dichotomised into non - nrt ( varenicline or bupropion ; these groups were combined as the bupropion sample was too small ) vs. nrt product use ( single or combined ) ; those receiving no pharmacotherapy and those using nrt with varenicline or bupropion were excluded from analyses of pharmacotherapy .
behavioural support was divided into individual ( one - to - one ; non - group drop - in ) vs. group - based ( open / rolling groups ; closed groups ) support .
analyses univariate associations between nmr status and sociodemographic , smoking , health - related , and treatment characteristics were assessed using chi - square / t - tests for categorical / continuous variables , respectively .
a multi - variable logistic regression was used to explore independent relationships between nmr status ( normal vs. slow metabolisers ) and each of the sociodemographic , smoking , and health - related characteristics .
separate regression models were used to assess the association between nmr status and pharmacotherapy choice and behavioural support type , controlling for all other covariates .
as age did not meet the linearity assumption , it was transformed using the standard deviation of the variable as the scaling factor , and entered into the model as a continuous variable43 .
similarly , where nmr was treated as a continuous variable , it was log - transformed due to significant non - normality .
sensitivity analyses were conducted using stepwise regression models ( backward and forward methods ) , using nmr as a continuous variable and restricting the nrt sample to nrt patch - only users and non - nrt users to varenicline - only users , given that previous work has focused on these .
main analyses were also repeated defining nmr status by quartiles of individuals ( slow metabolisers in first quartile [ n = 458 ] vs. fast metabolisers in forth quartile [ n = 452 ]) and including an nmr status by last year quit attempt interaction term , based on the rationale that individuals may self - select treatment based on experiences with treatment during recent prior quit attempts .
data availability anonymised datasets generated during and / or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request .
results participants characteristics and association with nmr and nmr status of the 1,875 participants for whom saliva samples were obtained , 44 provided samples that contained insufficient saliva or were below the limit of quantification and 5 samples were lost in the post , resulting in 1,826 participants included in the final analysis ( fig. 1 ) .
the geometric mean ( gm ) nmr for all participants was 0.41 ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 0.40 - 0.42 ). of these , 71.5 % ( n = 1306 ) were normal ( gm = 0.53 , 95 % ci 0.52 = 0.55 ) and 28.5 % ( n = 520 ) were slow ( gm = 0.21 , 95 % ci 0.20 - 0.21 ) metabolisers .

the majority of the sample was white , female and in the c2de ses group ( table 1 ) .
high cigarette dependence was seen in approximately half the sample and most participants reported being extremely or very determined to quit .
just under half had attempted to quit in the previous year and just over half were identified as having poorer psychological wellbeing and / or poorer physical health ( at least one medical condition ) .
most participants used either nrt or varenicline during their quit attempt and around half sought one - to - one support .

normal metabolisers were on average older , more likely to be white , from lower ses groups , with greater cigarette dependence and poorer physical health and psychological wellbeing .
however , in adjusted logistic regression analysis , only older age remained a significant predictor of being a normal metaboliser ( adj or 1.49 ; 95 % ci 1.32 - 1.69 ; table 2 ) , with the model accounting for 6.7 % of the overall variance in nmr status .
in sensitivity analysis using nmr as a continuous variable , the linear regression model explained a similarly small amount of variance ( 7.3 %) .

association of nmr status with treatment choice results of the regression models exploring adjusted associations of choice of pharmacotherapy type ( varenicline / bupropion vs. nrt ) and behavioural support type ( individual vs. group ) with nmr status are presented in table 3 .
nmr status was not significantly associated with pharmacotherapy choice .
however , relative to slow metabolisers , normal metabolisers were significantly less likely to choose group behavioural support ( or = 0.67 , 95 % ci = 0.51 - 0.89 ) .
the models explained 9 % and 30 % of the variance in treatment choice , respectively .
sensitivity analyses using stepwise regression models and using nmr as a continuous variable confirmed these results .
no interactions between nmr and sss on treatment choice were identified , and the lack of association between nmr status or nmr with pharmacotherapy choice was not materially altered when restricting the nrt sample to nrt patch - only users and the non - nrt sample to varenicline - only users .
repeating the main analysis when defining nmr status by quartiles ( fast metabolisers [ forth quartile ] vs slow metabolisers [ first quartile ]) confirmed results : nmr status was not associated with pharmacotherapy choice ( adj or 0.98 ; 95 % ci 0.88 - 0.1.06 ) but relative to slow metabolisers , fast metabolisers were significantly less likely to choose group behavioural support ( adj or 0.81 ; 95 % ci 0.72 - 0.92 ) .
lastly , there was no significant interaction between nmr status and last year quit attempts on either pharmacotherapy or behavioural support treatment choice .

discussion this study set out to characterise nmr and nmr status in terms of its association with sociodemographic , smoking , and health - related characteristics and to examine the association between pharmacological / behavioural treatment choice and nmr .
normal vs slow nicotine metabolism was found to be associated with older age , and nmr was also linearly associated with being white , female and having a medical condition but with no other characteristics .
regarding treatment choice , normal nmr status was associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving group behavioural support but not with pharmacological treatment choice .
this study confirms previous research showing a positive association between age and nmr26 .
as it is unlikely nmr increases with age , given that there is no association of age ( within adults ) with hepatic levels of cyp2a6 , the enzyme involved in nicotine and cotinine metabolism , and no impact of age on in vivo nicotine or coumarin ( a cyp2a6 probe substrate ) metabolism44 , this probably reflects selection bias. that is , it is possible that the greater difficulty in stopping smoking observed in individuals with a normal nicotine metabolism20,45,46 results in an increased number of older smokers in this normal nmr subgroup .
if this is the case , age would be unlikely to influence the reliability of the biomarker given the suggested direction of the relationship .
the fact that age but not poor health remains independently associated with nmr status also suggests self - selection , given that the association of poor health is likely due to the greater number of comorbidities observed in older smokers .
the study also confirms previously observed associations of higher nmr ( though not nmr status ) with 1 ) being female , likely due to estrogen effects on inducing cyp2a6 , and 2 ) being of white / caucasian ethnicity due to a lower frequency of reduced - and loss - of function variants in caucasians16,47 - 49 .
it is unclear why continuous nmr ( but not categorised nmr status ) remains associated with poor physical health , even after controlling for age , and perhaps this reflects some underlying independent genetic association , power issues or artefactual confounding .
however , as these characteristics were not related to nmr status and did not differentiate between slow vs. normal metabolisers , explaining less than 8 % of the overall variance in nmr , this underlines the clinical utility of nmr status as a consistent and reliable marker across different populations .
this study also set out to explore the relationship between nmr status and treatment choice .
no association between nmr status and the use of either non - nrt or nrt - based pharmacotherapy was detected ( including nrt patch alone ) , implying that there is no treatment self - selection as a function of nmr status .
this is further confirmed by the fact that experience of recent quit attempts did not affect the association ( or lack thereof ) of nmr status with treatment choice .
given the improved effectiveness of non - nrt over nrt - based pharmacotherapy in normal but not slow metabolisers15 , this suggests there is room to improve treatment outcomes by personalising treatment .
specifically , as the numbers needed to treat reduces from 26 to 5 for nrt to non - nrt pharmacotherapy in normal metabolisers , this group could be treated preferentially with varenicline , bupropion or similar medication , something which is currently not the case .
good quality clinics may want to explore their capacity to test for this biomarker when assessing clients as a way of informing pharmacotherapy choice interestingly , normal metabolisers were less likely to choose group behavioural support .
as normal metabolizers were on average older , we analysed the data both as a confounder ( table 3 ) and as an age by nmr status interaction term ( not significant ) , suggesting age was not the explanation .
slower compared with faster metabolisers have been reported to benefit more from behavioural counselling alone13,20 .
while the cause of this relationship is largely unknown , normal or fast nicotine metabolism has been linked with longer smoking duration46 , increased cigarette craving during a quit attempt19,20,50 , and greater nicotine dependence37 .
given the greater difficulty in stopping smoking in this group , it could therefore be speculated that normal metabolisers may perceive an additional benefit from individual support compared with group support , which allows for flexible consultations that can be tailored to the clients personal situation and their experience of previous quit attempts51 .
in addition , the increased need for pharmacotherapy in this group may underlie this association as pharmacotherapy is more likely to be accessed via community practitioners ( e.g. general practitioners , pharmacists ) who predominantly offer individual support. by contrast , specialist stop smoking clinics provide a range of behavioural support including group counselling which may not always involve pharmacotherapy32 .
overall , however , the study that provided our data found that group support was more effective in supporting smokers to quit32 , which may suggest that normal metabolisers should be actively encouraged to consider group support even if their natural preference may be for one - to - one options .
this study has a number of limitations .
the cross - sectional design does not allow us to make causal or directional claims .
moreover , while we did include a variety of characteristics to investigate the association with nmr , a number of putative factors were not measured and some variables were only assessed with a single item .
although treatment site was controlled for in analysis , the extent to which the available resources and individual treatment providers within the region influenced treatment choice could not be determined directly .
yet , treatment site is unlikely to have influenced nmr and therefore this analysis .
lastly , while the initial sample collected was largely representative of smokers seeking treatment in the uk , there were some marked demographic and treatment differences between those who provided a sample and those who did not .
conclusions although significant associations between nmr and ethnicity , physical health and gender were identified , these sociodemographic , smoking , and health - related characteristics did not greatly influence variability in nmr and did not confound allocation to either slow or normal nmr status .
this suggests that nmr status is relatively unrelated to these variables , functioning consistently across different populations , thus increasing its potential for use in clinical practice .
the unexpected association of nmr status with behavioural support should be explored further in clinical trials and studies of real - world data .
given the association of nmr with pharmacotherapy efficacy , the finding that nmr status is currently not associated with pharmacotherapy choice suggests there is a need for providers to tailor smoking cessation therapies based on rate of nicotine metabolism as patients are not naturally selecting the option that has the highest potential efficacy for them .

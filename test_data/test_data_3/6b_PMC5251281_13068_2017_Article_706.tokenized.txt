background as an agrobacterium tumefaciens t - dna oncogene , t - 6b induces the development of tumors and the enation syndrome in vegetative tissues of transgenic plants .
most of these effects are related to increases in soluble sugar contents .
to verify the potential roles of t - 6b in the distribution of carbon in developing seeds , not in vegetative tissues , we fused an endosperm - specific promoter to the t - 6b gene for expression in transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants .
results the expression of t - 6b in reproductive organs did not induce the development of the enation syndrome , and moreover , promoted endosperm expansion , which increased the total seed biomass by more than 10 % .
additionally , t - 6b also increased oil content in mature seeds by more than 10 % accompanied with the decrease of starch and mucilage content at the same time .
conclusions t - 6b enhances seed biomass and helps oil biosynthesis but not polysaccharides in reproductive organs without disturbing vegetative growth and development .
our findings suggest t - 6b may be very useful for increasing oil production in biodiesel plants .

this family includes the genes 3 ' , 5 , 6a , 6b , rolb , rolc , orf8 , orf13 , lso , and various other t - dna genes [ 2 ] , which can induce the formation of tumors , known as crown galls , on many dicotyledonous plants .
the 6b gene is located at the tml locus [ 3 ] , and has been detected among the t - dna of all a. tumefaciens strains .
this gene appears to affect the proliferation of plant cells .
hooykaas et al .
[ 4 ] were the first to report that a 6b gene ( i.e. , a - 6b from strain ach5 ) induces the production of tumors on nicotiana glauca and kalanchoe tubiflora stems .
therefore , this gene was confirmed as an oncogene .
the 6b genes were subsequently determined to be responsible for the development of tumors in nicotiana tabacum plants [ 5 , 6 ] .
variants of the 6b protein differ regarding their ability to induce tumor development , with t - 6b having the strongest oncogenic activity .
the following four amino acid fragments are necessary for t - 6b to be able to produce tumors in infected plants ( the sequences and coordinates for t - 6b are given in parentheses ) : l.yvy .
( lvyvyl ) at position 122 - 127 ( 62 - 67 ),... at ( gtvvt ) at position 151 - 155 ( 89 - 93 ) , . ppy ( ippw ) at position 157 - 160 ( 95 - 98 ) , and f.ai ( flai ) at position 196 - 199 ( 131 - 134 ) .
the proline residue at position 159 ( 97 ) is the only residue that is conserved in all rolb - like proteins .
additionally , the ltg sequence at position 57 - 59 in the t - 6b protein is a determinant for the production of large tumors [ 2 ] .
the results presented herein demonstrate that the 6b coding sequences contribute to the differences in tumor development among the oncogenes .
however , the 6b promoters may also influence tumor formation .
the ectopic expression of 6b genes in plants results in various symptoms , including enations , catacorollas , tubular leaves , expanded cotyledons , corkscrew stems , short and thick roots , ectopic shoots on hypocotyls , fragmented leaf primordia , vein thickening , hyponastic petioles , and epigastric leaf veins .
this unique set of 6b - induced modifications is called the enation syndrome [ 7 , 8 ] , which is the consequence of localized 6b expression and the movement of one or more unidentified 6b - induced enation factors .
these factors are transported through the phloem , cross graft junctions , and mainly affect the growth of young tissues [ 7 , 9 ] .
tumors form in plants expressing t - 6b mainly because of increasing osmolality due to glucose and fructose .
leaves expressing t - 6b contain considerably more glucose , fructose , and sucrose than mock - infiltrated leaves [ 10 ] .
glucose and fructose contents increase in parallel by a factor of 3 or 4 , while sucrose levels increase by a factor of 2 or 3 [ 10 ] .
early studies showed that the phytohormone - like effects of 6b to enhance cell expansion and epigastric growth had no relationship with auxin and cytokinin [ 7 , 9 ] .
however , takahashi et al .
[ 11 ] recently observed abnormal auxin and cytokinin accumulation in dex - ak - 6b seedlings , indicating that these hormones are important for the 6b phenotype .
as photosynthates , glucose and sucrose are substrates used to synthesize organic polymers .
starch and oil are the two most important seed storage polymers , and they are produced in two typical pathways that require glucose or sucrose [ 12 ] .
in monocots , starch is present mainly in the endosperm , while oil mainly accumulates in the embryo .
in almost all dicots , seed development includes an endosperm phase , during which starch accumulates , and a cotyledon phase , in which oil accumulates [ 13 - 15 ] .
starch biosynthesis in dicots temporarily increases the local sink strength to form a carbohydrate reserve that can be used for metabolic or growth processes [ 16 ] .
although starch is present during the early seed developmental stage of dicotyledonous plants , lipid is used as the final storage material in wild - type seeds [ 15 , 17 ] .
oilseeds accumulate lipids as a source of energy and carbon for seedling growth following germination [ 18 - 20 ] .
triacylglycerols ( tags ) are the major storage lipids that accumulate in developing seeds , flower petals , pollen grains , and fruits of several plant species [ 21 ] .
in arabidopsis seeds , tags are mainly stored in embryo , but the endosperm also accumulates 10 - 15 % of seed oil [ 22 , 23 ] .
the proanthocyanidin and mucilage contents , which are positively controlled by glabra2 , are negatively correlated with the amount of tags in the seed [ 24 - 26 ] .
plant tags are important nutrient sources for humans .
they also serve as precursors for the industrial production of chemicals and as renewable biofuels because they consist of abundant forms of reduced carbon that are highly enriched in energy [ 27 - 29 ] .
because of the importance of tag , to improve the seed oil content has become an important target in the field of plant research .
starch degradation and fatty acid formation in dicot seeds are related to the carbon flux from carbohydrates to oils , and the underlying mechanism has been the focus of several studies [ 30 - 33 ] .
modified vegetative growth induced by 6b occurs because of changes to the distribution of carbohydrates [ 2 , 9 , 10 ] .
we hypothesized that the expression of t - 6b during arabidopsis thaliana endosperm development affects the allocation of carbon and results in increased availability of soluble sugars for developing seeds .
to test this hypothesis , we transformed a. thaliana plants with t - 6b for endosperm - specific expression .
we observed that t - 6b expression led to increase lipid synthesis but decrease in the production of starch and mucilage and accelerated starch and sucrose degradation .
additionally , a. thaliana seed yields increased , with no effects on seed phenotype .
these results confirm that t - 6b influences carbon allocation in reproductive tissues in the absence of the enation syndrome , which is particularly relevant for the metabolic engineering of biodiesel plants for increased seed oil production .
methods plant growth and seed biomass analysis arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in a phytotron at 22 degreesc with 70 % relative humidity under a 16 - h light / 8 - h dark cycle ( light intensity : 250 micromol photons m - 2 s - 1 ) .
the col - 0 ecotype was used as the wild - type control .
for 100 - seed weight measurements , seeds were harvested from six plants and dried at 37 degreesc for 2 days .
the following harvested seeds were also dried using the same method .
the seeds collected from six plants underwent sample quartering , after which 100 seeds were randomly selected from each sample .

semi - quantitative and quantitative pcr seeds , siliques , or leaves were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen , after which total rna was isolated using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
samples were treated with dnase i to remove any residual genomic dna .
total rna ( 1 microg ) was used to synthesize cdna with the revertaid ( tm ) first strand cdna synthesis kit ( fermentas , usa ) .
semi - quantitative pcr was conducted using equal amounts of synthesized cdna ( i.e. , based on the signal of reference gene products ) .
the synthesized cdna concentration was adjusted to 5 ng microl - 1 , and 15 ng was used for qpcr analysis .
the qpcr was completed in a 20 - microl solution containing 5 microm specific primers and a sybr green pcr master mix ( fermentas ) .
the qpcr program was as follows : 95 degreesc for 4 min ; 40 cycles of 95 degreesc for 30 s and 60 degreesc for 30 s. the melting curve analysis was completed by increasing the temperature from 60 to 95 degreesc at a rate of 0.05 degreesc s - 1 .
the specificity of the qpcr amplifications was verified by the presence of a single band following gel electrophoresis .
relative expression levels were calculated using the comparative c t method [ 37 ] , with gene expression levels normalized against the values of the ubiquitin10 housekeeping gene .
data were analyzed using the student 's t test .
determination of carbohydrate content and starch staining starch , sucrose , and glucose were extracted and analyzed as described by sun et al .
[ 38 ] and zhang et al .
[ 39 ] and according to the protocols provided in cfhn - k - sucgl and cfhn - k - tsta megazyme kits ( bray , co. wicklow , ireland ) .
for starch staining , a. thaliana seeds were cut with a surgical blade and incubated in a 50 % ( v / v ) iodine solution ( i.e. , lugol 's solution ) for 20 min [ 39 ] .
excess staining solution was removed by washing seeds with distilled water .
protein isolation and enzyme activity analysis siliques were collected at 7 daf , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and ground to a fine powder in mortars .
total protein was extracted from 100 mg powder using the plant total protein extraction kit ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's recommended procedure , but without protease inhibitors .
the extracted proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 150 v for 1.5 - 2 h ) using a 4 - 12 % gradient gel .
the separated proteins were visualized using coomassie blue to estimate protein abundance [ 37 , 40 ] .
equal amounts of protein from different samples were added to 100 mg ml - 1 starch solutions and incubated at 28 degreesc for 4 h. the starch - degraded solutions were stained with iodine to analyze the remaining starch granules .
lipid analysis 100 mg seeds were used for lipid analysis for whole seed samples and 3 mg seeds were taken for the lipid analysis of separated endosperm and embryo .
the separation of embryo and endosperm was carried out according to the method as described by penfield et al .
[ 22 ] .
the tlc and gc experiments were completed using modified versions of published procedures [ 41 - 43 ] .
briefly , seed , endosperm , or embryo was homogenized in a potter - elvehjem homogenizer with homogenate solution [ 1 ml 0.15 m acetic acid and 3.75 ml methanol : chloroform ( 2:1 ; v / v )] .
the extract was transfered to a glass tube ( with a screw cap ) and combined with 1.25 ml of chloroform from rinsing of the homogenizer .
h2o of 1.25 ml was added to the extract .
the sample was mixed vigorously and centrifuged ( approximately 250 rcf for 2 min ) .
the chloroform phase was carefully transferred to a new glass tube .
extraction volumes equivalent of 2.5 mg seed mass for whole seed sample , 0.3 mg for embryo , and 0.6 mg for endosperm were taken for tlc analysis .
extraction volumes equivalent of 0.5 mg seed mass for the three samples were used for gc analysis .
after dried under nitrogen flow , lipids were re - dissolved with 40 microl hexane .
then samples were loaded onto tlc silica gel 60 plates ( merck ) and separated with a hexane : diethyl ether : acetic acid ( 70:30:1 , v / v / v ) solution .
plates were sprayed with 20 % phosphomolybdic acid hydrate in ethanol to visualize lipids or sprayed with 0.05 % primuline for further gc analysis .
relative intensity of different lipid species was analysis by the software imagj [ 44 , 45 ] .
the tag spots on the tlc plates were transferred to glass tubes ( with screw caps ) and methylated with 2 ml 2 % ( v / v ) h2so4 in methanol at 90 degreesc for 90 min .
hexane ( 2 ml ) and h2o ( 3 ml ) were added to the solutions , which were then vigorously mixed for 20 s. the fatty acid methyl esters in hexane were analyzed by gc , which was completed using a 6890 n gas chromatograph ( agilent technologies , wilmington , de , usa ) equipped with an auto - sampler ( ctc analytics ag , zwingen , switzerland ) and a flame ionization detector .
the data were analyzed using the chemstation ( revision b.02.01 ) program ( agilent technologies ) .
mucilage analysis seed coat mucilage was stained with 0.01 % ruthenium red under different conditions to produce optimal results [ 46 , 47 ] .
mature dried seeds and seeds imbibed in water for 1 h were stained directly to analyze the mucilage biomass at the epidermal cells of a. thaliana seed coats .
primers the details of the primers used in this study are listed in table 1 .
the oligonucleotides were purchased from genscript ( nanjing , china ) .
results t - 6b expression in the endosperm increases seed biomass the promoter of the glutelin precursor gene ( gt1 ) , which is primarily expressed in the rice endosperm [ 48 ] , was fused to t - 6b for subsequent expression in transgenic a. thaliana ( atg6b ) plants .
as expected , t - 6b was expressed in developing seeds , but not in vegetative tissues .
its transcription level sharply increased from 4 to 7 days after flowering ( daf ) , which corresponds to the starch synthesis stage in a. thaliana plants .
the t - 6b transcript abundance was the highest at 7 daf , and then gradually decreased until transcripts were undetectable after 12 daf ( fig. 1a ) , which coincides with the end of the endosperm development stage [ 15 ]. fig. 1 expression of gt1p : t - 6b in arabidopsis thaliana leads to biomass changes .

values are presented as the mean +/ - standard deviation and n = 3 seed biomass was determined according to 100 - seed weight , seed weight per silique , seed number per silique , and seed yield per plant .
significant differences were observed between wild - type columbia ( col - 0 ) and atg6b plants for all indices , except for seed number per silique .
additionally , the enation syndrome was not detected in any seed ( fig. 1b , c ) .
iku1 ( haiku1 , at2g35230 ) , iku2 ( haiku2 , at3g19700 ) , and mini3 ( miniseed 3 , at1g55600 ) are responsible for endosperm development and their overexpression usually leads to increased seed size [ 49 ] .
we analyzed the expression levels of these three genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qpcr ) .
the iku1 , iku2 , and mini3 transcript levels during the early stages of silique development were higher in atg6b plants than in wild - type plants , especially at 7 daf ( fig. 2 ) .
these results suggest that t - 6b increases seed biomass by up - regulating the expression of iku1 , iku2 , and mini3. fig. 2 transcript levels of iku1 , iku2 , and mini3 in atg6b plants .
gene expression levels were analyzed in developing siliques at 4 , 7 , and 12 days after flowering .
error bars indicate the standard deviation and n = 3 .
* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 by student 's t - test t - 6b regulates carbohydrate metabolism in developing seeds to investigate the status of starch synthesis , we first analyzed the expression levels of sbe2.1 ( starch branching enzyme 2.1 , ec.2.4.1.18 , at2g36390 ) which is responsible for the starch branching , and aps1 ( adp glucose pyrophosphorylase 1 , ec.2.7.7.27 , at5g48300 ) encoding the small subunit of agpase ( adp glucose pyrophosphorylase ) that is crucial important for the initial of starch synthesis [ 50 ] .
the qpcr results revealed that the sbe2.1 and aps1 transcript levels were considerably lower in atg6b plants than in col - 0 plants at 4 , 7 , and 12 daf ( fig. 3a ) .
in mature seeds , starch was stained with an iodine solution .
the intensity of the brown stain was lower in testa - peeled atg6b seeds than in col - 0 seeds ( fig. 3b ) .
further analyses indicated that starch contents were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) lower in atg6b seeds than in col - 0 seeds ( fig. 3c ) .
the results suggest that t - 6b can limit starch synthesis. fig. 3 changes in starch levels and relative gene expression levels .

* p < 0.05 by student 's t - test starch synthesis and degradation occur concurrently in developing seeds [ 15 , 51 ] , resulting in fluctuating starch contents .
to confirm the effects of t - 6b on starch metabolism , in vitro biochemical detection experiments were conducted .
total proteins were extracted from siliques at 7 daf and stained with coomassie blue following gel electrophoresis ( fig. 4a ) .
equal amounts of total protein were then used to degrade starch .
the starch samples degraded by proteins isolated from atg6b siliques produced less intense iodine staining compared with the starch samples treated with the proteins extracted from wild - type siliques ( fig. 4b ) .
the results indicate that t - 6b decreases starch content in a. thaliana seeds by inhibiting synthesis and accelerating degradation. fig. 4 starch degradation analysis .
a coomassie blue - stained total proteins isolated from siliques at 7 days after flowering .
b total starch - degrading enzyme activity .
proteins extracted from siliques at 7 days after flowering were incubated with starch standard solutions .
samples were then stained with an iodine solution .
an incubation without protein was used as a control a previous study concluded that the expression of t - 6b in tobacco leaves can increase soluble sugar contents [ 10 ] .
therefore , we speculated that the soluble sugar contents of atg6b seeds were also influenced by t - 6b expression .
to prove this hypothesis , we investigated the glucose and sucrose contents in mature a. thaliana seeds .
we observed that the glucose content was higher in atg6b seeds than in col - 0 seeds , while sucrose abundance exhibited the opposite pattern ( fig. 5a ) .
it is possible that the lower sucrose level in atg6b seeds was caused by increased sucrose degradation .
we next investigated the expression levels of sus2 ( sucrose synthase 2 , ec.2.4.1.13 , at5g49190 ) which is an isoform of sucrose synthase mainly expressed at the later seed development stage responsible for the sucrose degradation , and a / n - inva ( alkaline / neutral invertase a , ec.3.2.1.26 , at1g56560 ) , encoding a kind of neutral invertase [ 52 , 53 ] .
as expected , the expression levels of these two genes were higher in atg6b plants than in wild - type controls ( fig. 5b ) .
the findings suggest that t - 6b expressed in endosperm of a. thaliana seeds can increase glucose contents and promote sucrose degradation. fig. 5 glucose and sucrose responses to the expression of t - 6b in seeds .

* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 by student 's t - test t - 6b promotes the biosynthesis of oil in seeds starch in endosperm is considered " transitory starch " in oilseeds , and its degradation is accompanied by the formation of fatty acids in cotyledons [ 51 ] .
we speculated that the role of t - 6b in the carbohydrates metabolism has a direct or indirect effect on lipid synthesis .
siliques at different developmental stages were collected for gene expression analyses , while mature seeds were harvested for lipid content investigations .
we first determined the wri1 ( wrinkled1 , at3g54320 ) and dgat1 ( diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 , ec.2.3.1.20 , at2g19450 ) expression levels [ 54 - 60 ] .
expressing t - 6b during endosperm development stimulated the transcription of wri1 and dgat1 .
the wri1 expression level increased at 7 and 12 daf , while dgat1 transcription sharply increased at 7 daf ( fig. 6a ). fig. 6 role of t - 6b during fatty acid metabolism .

relative intensity of lipid species was calculated by imagj ( below panel ) .
* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 by student 's t - test .
error bars indicate the standard deviation and n = 3 a lipid content assay was conducted using mature a. thaliana seeds .
based on thin layer chromatography ( tlc ) results , we determined that the tag spot for atg6b seeds was larger than the corresponding spot for col - 0 seeds ( fig. 6b ) .
furthermore , quantitative analyses by gas chromatography ( gc ) revealed that the tag content in dry atg6b seeds ( 44.72 % +/ - 0.89 ) was approximately 10 % higher than the tag content in dry col - 0 seeds ( 35.41 % +/ - 0.34 ) ( fig. 6c ) .
in generally , up - regulated expression of wri1 leads to the increase in the levels of fatty acid ( fa ) [ 55 , 56 ]. by comparing the corresponding grayscale of different lipid species from col - 0 and atg6b on tlc plate by imagj , the relative intensities of atg6b seed lipid bands were significantly higher than the ones of col - 0 seed lipid bands ( fig. 6c ) , indicating that fa content in transgenic seeds significantly higher than the one in wild - type seeds .
in arabidopsis seed , oil is synthesized in both endosperm and embryo .
in order to measure their tag levels , embryo and endosperm / seed coat of mature seeds were separated as describe by penfield et al .
[ 22 , 23 ] ( fig. 7a ) , and then lipid assays were further conducted .
based on thin layer chromatography ( tlc ) results , we determined that the tag spots from embryo and endosperm of atg6b seeds were larger than the corresponding spots from the ones of col - 0 seeds ( fig. 7a ) .
furthermore , quantitative analyses by gas chromatography ( gc ) revealed that the tag contents of the embryo ( 36.29 % +/ - 0.55 ) and endosperm ( 8.44 % +/ - 0.78 ) from atg6b seeds were significantly higher than the ones ( 29.55 % +/ - 0.39 , 5.15 % +/ - 0.51 ) from col - 0 seeds ( fig. 7b ) .
different from tag contents , the ratios of different fatty acid components from the whole seed , embryo , and endosperm were almost the same between atg6b and col - 0 seeds ( fig. 7c ). fig. 7 lipid content and fatty acid composition analysis in both embryo and endosperm .

therefore , we investigated the expression levels of glabra2 , which is responsible for mucilage synthesis [ 25 ] .
this gene was expressed at lower levels in atg6b seeds than in the wild - type controls ( fig. 8a ) .
additionally , we stained the seed mucilage with ruthenium red , and observed that mucilage biomass was considerably lower for atg6b seeds than for col - 0 seeds based on the intensity of the pink stain ( fig. 8b1 , 3 ) .
furthermore , the integrity of the mucilage layer surrounding the atg6b testa was compromised ( fig. 8b2 , 4 ) .
because of the negative relationship between mucilage abundance on the seed coat surface and tags in the seed [ 24 - 26 ] , we believe that the role of t - 6b in reducing the mucilage abundance is beneficial to increase seed oil content. fig. 8 effects of t - 6b expressed in the endosperm on seed mucilage .

bars in 1 and 3 = 100 microm , 2 and 4 = 200 microm discussion among the 6b t - dna genes from all a. tumefaciens strains , t - 6b is the most oncogenic .
the ectopic expression of 6b results in the development of the enation syndrome in vegetative tissues [ 5 - 7 ] .
our investigation revealed that the ectopic expression of t - 6b in reproductive tissues ( e.g. , endosperm ) increases seed biomass without compromising the development of vegetative tissues ( fig. 1b ) .
in other words , t - 6b induces the enation syndrome in vegetative tissues , but only increases the biomass of reproductive organs .
it is likely that t - 6b up - regulates the expression of genes responsible for endosperm development , including iku1 , iku2 , and mini3 ( fig. 2 ) , which increases the size of the ovaries to produce relatively large sinks .
therefore , the t - 6b gene may be useful for increasing rapeseed crop yields .
t - 6b activities increase leaf glucose , sucrose , and starch contents by regulating carbohydrate metabolism [ 7 - 10 ] .
the expression of t - 6b in the endosperm of a. thaliana plants increased glucose contents , but decreased the abundance of starch and sucrose in developing or mature seeds ( figs. 3 , 4 and 5 ) .
the decrease in starch and sucrose contents was accompanied by down - regulated expression of the starch synthesis - related genes sbe2.1 and aps1 ( fig. 3a ) and up - regulated expression of sus2 and a / n - inva , which encode sucrose - degrading proteins ( fig. 5 ) .
as is known , wri1 controlled by the b3 family is crucial for the synthesis of fatty acid [ 55 , 56 ] .
the up - regulated expression of wri1 suggests that t - 6b or 6b - induced mobile enation factors induce the glycolytic pathway in the endosperm and embryo , leading to increased availability of acetyl - coa for the synthesis of fatty acids in the endosperm and embryo .
the different effects of t - 6b on carbohydrate metabolism in vegetative and reproductive organs imply that the t - 6b functions influencing sugar metabolism are more complicated than expected .
additionally , the t - 6b molecular activities that regulate glucose contents are possibly the same in vegetative and reproductive organs , in contrast to the mechanisms mediating sucrose and starch metabolism .
these possibilities warrant further study .
in wild - type a. thaliana seeds , carbon is primarily stored in lipids [ 51 ] .
the endosperm begins to form 12 h after fertilization , while it starts to degrade at 12 daf , which correlates with the timing of starch synthesis and degradation .
cotyledons then form up until 16 daf , by which time the seeds have completed their development [ 15 ] .
the expression of t - 6b in the developing endosperm results in significantly up - regulated wri1 and dgat1 transcription and ultimately increases the seed tag content ( figs. 6 , 7 ) .
at the same time , t - 6b decreases the mucilage biomass by repressing glabra2 expression ( fig. 8 ) .
therefore , t - 6b expression in the endosperm leads to enhanced distribution of photosynthesis assimilation products to form tags , which function as the final storage products .
the ability of t - 6b to increase the allocation of carbon to tags in seeds may be useful for increasing crop yield .
finally , our results expand our understanding of t - 6b functions .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to confirm that unlike the effects of t - 6b expression in vegetative tissues , the expression of this gene in reproductive organs leads to increased seed biomass and greater partitioning of photosynthates to tags without causing the enation syndrome .
our findings may form the basis of future studies aimed at improving oilseed crop yields .
conclusion a novel function of t - 6b gene was found in this study .
previous researches showed that ectopic expression of t - 6b gene in vegetative organ led to enation syndrome and accumulation of soluble sugar around the gene expression loci .
after letting the gene specifically express in reproductive organ seed , the t - 6b not only caused no enation syndrome of seed , but also reduced the soluble sugar content , while increasing mature seed biomass and oil content .
our findings suggest that t - 6b may be very useful for increasing oil production in biodiesel plants .

the few keys available for the oriental region are outdated ( e.g. , bhat and gupta 1977 ) or are limited to an island ( chou and sharkey 1989 ) .
those limited to a country ( sharkey 1996 , chen and yang 2006 ) deal with a partly or completely east palaearctic fauna .
only the genus euagathis szepligeti , 1900 , has received more attention ( van achterberg and chen 2002 ) .
this paper is an attempt to give an overview of the diversity of agathidinae of vietnam and to supply keys to the taxa .
for the first time all available vietnamese species are illustrated by colour photographs .
the study of variation in most species is severely hampered by the lack of specimens , so the keys presented here are just a start to a better understanding of the diversity of the subfamily in vietnam .
the paper by sharkey et al .
( 2009 ) on the oriental genera of agathidinae ( with special attention to the fauna of thailand ) appeared just before the present paper was finished and deals with a similar fauna .
it is an important attempt to summarize the latest results on the phylogeny of the subfamily and deals with some recent finds in thailand .
however , the number of genera found in vietnam is higher than in thailand ; e.g. the genus bassus fabricius s.s. is not recorded for thailand , and we found two new genera in vietnam .
the different interpretation of some diagnostic characters , the use of additional characters , the correct interpretation of a type species and the new genera are sufficient reason to include a new key to the genera in our review .
we propose another generic name ( zelodia van achterberg gen. n. ) for one genus following the correct interpretation of a type species .
in addition , keys to all known species from vietnam are presented and the 42 species new to science are described and illustrated .
the new species represent two - thirds of the total number of species of agathidinae known from vietnam .
the biology of most species is unknown , but in general agathidines are koinobiont endoparasitoids of larvae of lepidoptera .
the species with a short ovipositor select exposed larvae and those with a long ovipositor use larvae with a concealed way of life .
material and methods two recent ( and probably largest ) collections of agathidines from vietnam are used for this revision : the braconidae collection in the institute of ecology & biological resources ( iebr ) at hanoi ( assembled by the second author ) and the ncb naturalis collection ( rmnh ) at leiden ( assembled during five rmnh - iebr expeditions in vietnam ) .
for identification of the subfamily agathidinae , see van achterberg ( 1990 , 1993 , 1997 ) , for references to the genera , see yu et al .
( 2007 ) and sharkey et al .
( 2009 ; but genus bassus omitted in the description part ) and for the terminology used in this paper ( except for the stigmal spot ) , see van achterberg ( 1988 , 1993 ) .
the stigmal spot is a well defined and more or less circular dark brown patch below the parastigma present in many species ( figs 57 , 159 ; fig. 113 in bhat and gupta 1977 ; figs 19 - 21 , 26 - 28 in simbolotti & van achterberg , 1995 ) .
the ramellus is the short vein externally connected to the second submarginal cell of the fore wing ( figs 47 , 57 , 117 ) .
measurements are taken as indicated by van achterberg ( 1988 ) .
additional non - exclusive characters in the key are between brackets .
in the keys to species sometimes notes to similar species unknown from vietnam are included because they may occur in vietnam .
putative apomorphies were determined through outgroup comparison making assumptions about the placement of certain taxa in agathidinae according to the cladistic analysis by sharkey et al .
( 2006 ) .
no taxonomic history is presented in this paper ; for information is referred to the taxapad interactive catalogue ( yu et al. 2007 and later updates ) .

genus camptothlipsis enderlein , 1920 notes .
in vietnam only one species was found .
camptothlipsis hanoiensis sp. n. from north vietnam .
therophilus tonghuaensis ( chen & yang , 2006 ) comb. n. from jilin ( china ) was originally assigned to the genus camptothlipsis , but does not belong there because it has a shortvein r - m of the fore wing , resulting in a minute second submarginal cell and the basal metasomal tergites are coarsely sculptured ( not finely granulate ) .
recently , stevens et al .
( 2010 ) synonymised the senior genus baeognatha kokujev , 1903 with camptothlipsis , resulting in a change of name of the genus .
the synonymy is not accepted because the type species ( baeognatha turanica kokujev , 1903 ) does not run in the key by stevens et al. to camptothlipsis ( renamed in the paper as baeognatha ) because the vein r - m of the fore wing ( 1 - rs in stevens et al. ) is present ( figs 131 - 133 in simbolotti & van achterberg , 1992 ) .
baeognatha turanica is close to the genus agathis latreille considering the shape of the head , but differs by the elongate and nearly straight tarsal claws ( figs 138 , 140 , 141 , l.c. ) and , therefore , is retained as a separate genus .

genus coccygidium de saussure , 1892 notes .
prior to sharkey et al ( 2009 ) the old world species were included in the new world genus zelomorpha ashmead , 1900 or the old world genus coccygidium de saussure , 1892 .
most oriental species belong to the zelodia gen .
n. , but some oriental species and most species in the afrotropical and australian regions belong here .
including disophrys concolor szepligeti , 1908 from sundaland and possibly sri lanka ; the type species of the genus amputostypos sharkey , 2009 .
the lectotype of disophrys concolor ( designated by van achterberg 1974 ) has been examined and it has the fore spur with a long curved and glabrous apical spine as figured in the key ( a ) for coccygidium .
therefore , amputostypos sharkey is synonymised with coccygidium de saussure ( syn. n. ). from the north - eastern oriental region only two species of coccygidium de saussure are known : coccygidium sissoo ( wilkinson , 1929 ) comb. n. [ a senior synonym of zelomorpha amplarga gupta & bhat , 1972 , synonymy according to bhat ( 1978 )] and coccygidium angostura ( bhat & gupta , 1977 ) .
in vietnam only the last species was found .

combination of " corona " ( latin for " crown ") and the generic name agathis latreille because of the protuberances of the scutellum and the axillae .
gender : feminine. diagnosis .

phylogenetic position .
putative synapomorphous character states of the new genus coronagathis are the horns of the scutellum , the wing - like axillae and the coarsely sculptured and elongate hind coxa , surpassing the apex of the first tergite .
its position is uncertain , but seems to be betweenthe genus disophrys foerster and the coccygidium complex .
similar to disophrys because of the carinae of the frons ( present and running to the lateral ocelli ) and the elongate hind leg .
however , the derived character state of the short vein m + cu of the hind wing indicates that it belongs to the more derived group consisting of the coccygidium complex and the genus euagathis szepligeti .
the new genus lacks the synapomorphies of the coccygidium complex as the apical antennal spine and the long inner spur of the middle tibia .
it cannot be included in euagathis , because euagathis is characterised by the derived character state of the absent lateral carinae of the frons .
the genus hypsostypos baltazar from sulawesi and sundaland is similar , but hypsostypos has several autapomorphies .
for example , the long impressed malar suture , the reduced notauli and the enlarged lamelliform antennal sockets. distribution. vietnam. biology. unknown .

except for the aberrant scutellum and axillae it may be confused with aberrant species of the genus disophrys foerster because of the carinae of the frons ( present and running to the lateral ocelli ) , the more or less angulate hind trochantellus and the elongate hind leg .
however , it is separated from disophrys by the size of the subbasal cell of the hind wing ( narrower than plical lobe ( fig. 109 ; about as wide as plical lobe in disophrys ) and the short vein m + cu of the hind wing ( distinctly shorter than vein 1 - m versus at least subequal in disophrys ) .
superficially similar to the genus euagathis szepligeti , but the scutellum bears a pair of large horns ( fig. 110 ; absent in euagathis ) , the frons has lateral carinae ( fig. 105 ; absent in euagathis ) , the hind trochantellus is more or less angulate ventrally ( rounded ventrally in euagathis ) and the subbasal cell of the hind wing is narrower than the plical lobe ( fig. 109 ; subequal in euagathis ). description .

very close to cremnops desertor ( linnaeus , 1758 ) .
the traditionally used differences for separation are not sufficient and , consequently , it was synonymised by sharkey ( 1996 ) .
both species are very variable in colour , especially the extension of the dark parts of the wing membrane is variable and thus useless for diagnosis .
nevertheless , it is possible to separate the west palaearctic typical specimens of cremnops desertor from the east palaearctic and oriental specimens ( including cremnops atricornis ) by the relative length of the fore tarsus of the females .
in cremnops desertor the fore tarsus is distinctly longer than the fore tibia and ( including claws ) about as long as the tibia in cremnops atricornis .
the vietnamese specimens have the first tergite 1.5 - 1.8 times as long as its apical width ( up to 2.2 times in east palaearctic specimens according to sharkey ( 1996 )) and the vertex is yellowish - brown ( fig. 113 ) .

phylogenetic position .
probably sister to the genus euagathis szepligeti according to sharkey et al .
( 2009 ) , but it belongs to the coccygidium complex .
it shares with the complex two synapomorphies : the apical spine of the antenna and the elongate inner spur of the middle tibia.apomorphous character states of the new genus zelodia within the coccygidium complex are the comparatively narrow notauli and the densely sculptured ventral face of the hind femur .
the genus coccygidium de saussure has the following synapomorphies : the fore spur with a long glabrous apical spine , the hind coxa with a longitudinal carina or rugae and the frons with more or less developed carinae or crests. notes .
sharkey et al .
( 2006 ) included the zelomorpha sulana group of bhat and gupta ( 1977 ) in hypsostypos baltazar , because of the rugose ventral surface of the hind femur and some other character - states .
however , the type species of hypsostypos has several autapomorphies and lacks the apical spine of the antenna typical for the coccygidium complex to which this group belongs .
therefore , the zelomorpha sulana group is excluded from hypsostypos and sharkey et al .
( 2009 ) intended to name this group amputostypos .
unfortunately , they overlooked that the designated type species ( disophrys concolor szepligeti , 1908 ) does not belong to this group .
to the newly proposed genus zelodia belong the following described species ( all are new combinations ) : zelodia absoluta ( chen & yang , 1998 ) china zelodia achterbergi ( chen & yang , 2006 ) china zelodia albopilosella ( cameron , 1908 ) sarawak zelodia chromoptera ( roman , 1913 ) philippines ( mindanao ) zelodia cordata ( bhat & gupta , 1977 ) india , burma , singapore zelodia diluta ( turner , 1918 ) australia ( queensland ) zelodia dravida ( bhat & gupta , 1977 ) india , china zelodia exornata ( turner , 1918 ) australia ( queensland ) zelodia longidorsata ( bhat & gupta , 1977 ) india zelodia longiptera ( yang & chen , 2006 ) china zelodia maculipes ( cameron , 1911 ) new guinea ( zma ) zelodia nigra ( bhat & gupta , 1977 ) philippines ( mindoro ) , ? china zelodia nihonensis ( sharkey , 1996 ) far east russia , china , korea , japan .

the holotype is a male , not a female as indicated in the original description .
the sculpture of the notauli is variable : it varies from distinctly crenulate to nearly smooth .
also the shape of the first tergite is rather variable , as robust as depicted by chen & yang ( 2006 ) to fairly slender .
this species resembles zelodia quadrifossulata ( enderlein ) from sundaland ( e.g. , by the robust first metasomal tergite with some punctures latero - apically ) , but the latter differs by having the hind coxa largely smooth dorsally , the propodeum and the metanotum yellowish - brown , the scutellum moderately punctate and with distinct interspaces between the punctures , the mesopleuron only punctulate and the hind femur less slender .
very similar to zelodia achterbergi ( chen & yang ) , but that species differs mainly by the sparsely punctate mesopleuron ( interspaces wider than diameter of punctures ) and no distinct rugae near the prepectal carina .
also similar to zelodia similis ( bhat & gupta ) from philippines , but zelodia similis has the hind leg and metasoma ( blackish ) - brown , ool less than pol , face moderately punctate , length of malar space twice basal width of mandible , scutellum sparsely and moderately punctate , second tergite parallel - sided and comparatively slender .

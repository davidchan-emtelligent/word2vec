we previously isolated efdg1 , a lytic phage against enterococci for therapeutic use .
nevertheless , efdg1 - resistant bacterial strains ( efdg1r ) have evolved .
eflk1 , a new highly effective phage against efdg1r strains , was isolated in this study .
the genome of eflk1 was fully sequenced , analyzed , and deposited in genbank .
cover - datenovember / december 2015 genome announcement although enterococcus faecalis is a commensal gram - positive microorganism inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract , it can cause highly fatal forms of infection ( 1 , 2 ) .
numerous existing potent antibiotics against enterococcal infections are still insufficient to preclude morbidity and mortality ( 3 , 4 ) .
the most problematic are antibiotic - resistant strains in biofilms ( 5 , 6 ) , mainly the vancomycin - resistant enterococci ( vre ) , declared by the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) as " extremely difficult organisms to treat and a major public health threat " ( http :// www.cdc.gov / hai / organisms / organisms.html ) .
one promising solution that may reconcile the deficiencies associated with current antibiotic treatments is phage therapy ( 7 , 8 ) .
previously , we isolated efdg1 , a lytic phage for therapeutic use that efficiently killed e. faecalis ( 9 ) .
nevertheless , bacterial strains resistant to efdg1 ( efdg1r ) evolved .
to combat efdg1r strains , we isolated a new phage termed eflk1 , which was able to eradicate the resistant strain .
eflk1 was isolated from sewage effluents , and its dna was purified , sequenced , and analyzed , as previously described for efdg1 ( 9 ) .
briefly , the phage was purified using the top agar method and stored at 4degreesc without chloroform .
dna was purified using the phage dna isolation kit ( norgen biotek ) .
the illumina nextera xt dna kit ( san diego , ca ) was used to prepare libraries .
dna amplification was carried out by a limited - cycle pcr , and the amplified dna was purified using ampure xp beads .
the dna libraries were normalized , pooled , and tagged in a common flow cell at 2 x 250 - bp paired - end reads , followed by sequencing using the illumina miseq platform .
the quality of the reads was assessed by fastqc ( http :// www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk / projects / fastqc ) .
the de novo assembly with end trimmed reads was performed using geneious 8.1 ( biomatters ) .
the genome was assembled from 25,561 short reads , with an average coverage of 30 bases per base .
analysis of the open reading frames ( orfs ) , annotation , and phylogenetic tree generation were also performed by geneious 8.1 and its plugins .
trnas were predicted using trnascan - se version 1.21 ( http :// lowelab.ucsc.edu / trnascan - se /) .
the eflk1 phage contains a circular genome of 130,952 bp , with 209 putative coding sequences and a g + c content of 35.9 % .
no trna genes were identified in eflk1 , in contrast to efdg1 , which harbors 23 genes .
according to our analysis , eflk1 belongs to the spounavirinae subfamily of the myoviridae phage family .
as such , eflk1 shows similarities with the other e. faecalis spounavirinae phages , efdg1 ( accession no. kp339049.1 [ 9 ]) , phief24c ( accession no. ap009390.1 [ 10 ]) and ecp3 ( accession no. kj801817.1 ) .
eflk1 contains a significant cluster of dna replication components , including two dna polymerases ( eflk1 _ orf130 and eflk1 _ orf142 ) , two dna helicases ( eflk1 _ orf161 and eflk1 _ orf159 ) , dna maturase a ( eflk1 _ orf121 ) , three dna exonucleases ( eflk1 _ orf127 , eflk1 _ orf157 , and eflk1 _ orf158 ) , resolvase ( eflk1 _ orf147 ) , and primase ( eflk1 _ orf155 ) .
additionally , with regard to transcription , eflk1 contains a gene for rna polymerase ( eflk1 _ orf176 ) and a sigma factor ( eflk1 _ orf134 ) , which are conserved among many spounavirinae phages , including the 3 e. faecalis strains and other gram - positive bacteria .
nucleotide sequence accession number .
the full - genome sequence of phage eflk1 has been deposited in genbank under the accession no. kr049063 .

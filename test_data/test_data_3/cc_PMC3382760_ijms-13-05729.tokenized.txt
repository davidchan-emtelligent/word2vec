cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) is one of the main causes of mortality worldwide , and dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cvd .
ginseng has been widely used in the clinic to treat cvd .
ginsenoside rg3 , one of the major active components of ginseng , has been reported to exhibit antiobesity , antidiabetic , and cardioprotective effects .
however , the effect of ginsenoside rg3 on hepatic lipid metabolism remains unclear .
therefore , we investigated whether ginsenoside rg3 would regulate hepatic lipid metabolism with amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) activation in hepg2 cells .
ginsenoside rg3 significantly reduced hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels .
furthermore , ginsenoside rg3 inhibited expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein - 2 ( srebp - 2 ) and 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methyl glutaryl coenzyme a reductase ( hmgcr ) .
ginsenoside rg3 increased activity of ampk , a major regulator of energy metabolism .
these results suggest that ginsenoside rg3 reduces hepatic lipid accumulation with inhibition of srebp - 2 and hmgcr expression and stimulation of ampk activity in hepg2 cells .
therefore , ginsenoside rg3 may be beneficial as a food ingredient to lower the risk of cvd by regulating dyslipidemia .
cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) ginsenoside rg3 cholesterol triglyceride srebp - 2 hmgcr ampk 1 .
introduction cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) is one of the major causes of mortality globally , and the mortality from cvd has been increasing at an alarming rate .
the world health organization estimates that deaths due to cvd will rise to 23.6 million by 2030 , which it is an approximate 40 % increase from 2004 rates [ 1,2 ] .
dyslipidemia , including high concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides , is a high risk factor for cvd [ 1 ] .
in the field of food science , studies on cvd concerned with dyslipidemia have focused on food ingredients that have the potential to reduce and regulate cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations .
ginseng is one of the most well - known herbal medicines in the world [ 3 ] .
ginsenosides , the major pharmacologically - active components of ginseng , are known for their biological activities and can be divided into several different compounds , such as rg3 , rb2 , rc , and rg1 [ 3 ] .
among ginsenosides , ginsenoside rg3 exhibits antiobesity [ 4 ] , antidiabetic [ 5,6 ] , anticancer , antihypertensive , and cardioprotective effects [ 7 ] .
ginsam , which is enriched in the ginsenoside rg3 , shows weight - lowering effects in an obese insulin - resistant animal model by changing the expression of genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism [ 8 ] .
treatment with ginsenoside rg3 is very effective for inhibiting lipid accumulation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes compared to that of rk1 or rg5 [ 9 ] .
nevertheless , it remains unresolved how ginsenoside rg3 inhibits hepatic lipid accumulation and whether it regulates the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein - 2 ( srebp - 2 ) and activation of amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) in hepg2 cells .
srebp - 2 plays an important role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by binding and activating the promoters of srebp - 2 - regulated genes , such as low - density lipoprotein receptor ( ldl - r ) , 3 ' - hydroxylmethyl glutaryl coenzyme a synthase ( hmgcs ) and 3 ' - hydroxylmethyl glutaryl coenzyme a reductase ( hmgcr ) [ 10 ] .
ldl - r is primarily responsible for the uptake of ldl from the circulation .
in contrast , hmgcs and hmgcr are major enzymes in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis [ 11 ] .
thus , srebp - 2 activation stimulates cholesterol uptake into the cells and cholesterol biosynthesis via up - regulation of ldl - r and hmgcr gene expression .
ampk is a key sensor in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism .
ampk is found in all eukaryotes and is activated by an increase in the cellular amp : atp ratio after atp depletion [ 12 ] .
once activated , ampk switches off anabolic pathways such as cholesterol , fatty acid , and triglyceride biosynthesis [ 13 ] .
in the liver , ampk inactivates key lipid biosynthesis enzymes such as acetyl - coa carboxylase - alpha ( acc - alpha ) and hmgcr , which regulate fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis , respectively [ 14 ] .
ginseng extract increases adiponectin protein expression in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes [ 5 ] .
the finding that adiponectin activates ampk and reduces cholesterol synthesis in apoe - deficient mice suggests that the regulation of hmgcr via ampk may be critical for regulating cholesterol metabolism in vivo [ 14 ] .
therefore , it is logical to hypothesize that ampk may be involved in the ginsenoside rg3 - induced hypolipidemic effects by reducing triglyceride and cholesterol levels .
this study was designed to investigate the hypolipidemic effects of ginsenoside rg3 in hepg2 cells .
we hypothesized that treatment with ginsenoside rg3 inhibits cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation with stimulation of ampk activity and inhibition of srebp - 2 expression in hepg2 cells .
2. results and discussion 2.1 .
effect of ginsenoside rg3 on hepg2 cell viability hepg2 cells were used to confirm that ginsenoside rg3 has inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation .
cells were cultured in various concentrations of rg3 for 8 , 24 , and 48 h to determine whether ginsenoside rg3 affects hepg2 cell viability .
the survival rates of hepg2 cells were unaffected in 1 or 10 mum rg3 after 48 h incubation ( figure 1 ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
in contrast , high doses ( 50 - 100 mum ) of rg3 decreased viability by 25 - 60 % after 48 h of incubation .
thus , the nontoxic concentrations were 1 - 10 mum ginsenoside rg3 in hepg2 cells .
meticulous care is required when treating cells with ginsenoside rg3 , because cytotoxicity has been reported in several in vitro studies .
ginsenoside rg3 exhibits ic50 ( 50 % growth inhibition concentration ) values of 41 mum in sk - hep - 1 hepatoma cancer cells [ 15 ] and potent cytotoxicity against hepg2 cells , with an ic50 value of approximately 50 mum after a 36 h incubation [ 16 ] .
a recent study reported that hepg2 cell viability decreased following treatment with 50 , 100 , or 200 mug / ml rg3 for 24 h [ 17 ] .
however , cell viability remained at 90 - 100 % in rg3 concentrations below 10 mum in the present study .
thus , a ginsenoside rg3 concentration of 10 mum was used in subsequent experiments .
2.2 .
effects of ginsenoside rg3 on lipid metabolism we investigated intracellular cholesterol and triglyceride contents to evaluate the effects of ginsenoside rg3 on the reduction of cholesterol and triglyceride .
hepg2 cells were treated with 10 mum ginsenoside rg3 for 8 or 24 h. the amount of cholesterol in hepg2 cells in the presence of ginsenoside rg3 was significantly reduced by 36 % in comparison with the control after a 24 h incubation ( figure 2a ) .
the hepg2 intracellular triglyceride content in the presence of ginsenoside rg3 also decreased by 15 % compared with that of hepg2 cells in the absence of ginsenoside rg3 ( figure 2b ) .
previous studies reported that treatment with high concentrations of ginsenoside rg3 ( 40 - 100 mum ) reduce intracellular triglyceride accumulation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes [ 4,9 ] .
hwang et al. suggested that ginsenoside rg3 is effective in inhibiting lipid biosynthesis by up - regulating ampk [ 4 ] .
treatment with ginsenoside rg3 results in a decrease in blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels in hyperlipidemic mice [ 5 ] and in obese type 2 diabetic rats [ 18 ] .
treatment with korean red ginseng extract , which is enriched with ginsenoside rg3 , reduces the serum total cholesterol level in c57bl / 6j mice fed a high - fat diet by down - regulating lipid - metabolism associated genes such as cholesterol 7alpha - hydroxylase ( cyp7a1 ) , which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol , steroids , and other lipids [ 19 ] .
in this study , ginsenoside rg3 reduced cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation in hepg2 cells .
2.3 .
effects of ginsenoside rg3 on gene expression of srebp - 2 and hmgcr cellular cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis is regulated by three members of the srebp family , namely srebp - 1a , srebp - 1c , and srebp - 2 .
srebp - 2 primarily regulates cholesterol metabolism by activating genes required for cholesterol biosynthesis such as hmgcs , hmgcr , farnesyl diphosphate synthase , and squalene synthase [ 20 ] .
nascent srebp - 2 is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane [ 10 ] .
when cells are deprived of sterols , a two - step proteolytic process releases the srebp - 2 nh2 - terminal fragment as a mature form of srebp - 2 , and it binds to sterol regulatory elements in the promoter regions of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis [ 21 ] .
a previous in vivo study reported that mrna levels of all srebp - 2 target genes , such as ldl - r , hmgcs , and hmgcr , decrease with a decrease in srebp - 2 mrna level in srebp cleavage - activating protein - deficient mice [ 22 ] .
food ingredients , such as curcumin [ 11 ] , skim milk , casein , whey , leucine , and valine [ 23 ] , interfere with srebp - 2 mrna expression , leading to a reduction in the cellular cholesterol level .
these previous studies indicate that inhibiting srebp - 2 expression may be involved in the decrease of cellular cholesterol level .
however , the regulatory effects of ginsenoside rg3 on srebp - 2 and hmgcr gene expression involved in lipid metabolism have not been reported in hepg2 cells .
we investigated the mrna expression of srebp - 2 and hmgcr to understand the mechanism that underlies the hypolipidemic effect of ginsenoside rg3 in hepg2 cells .
ginsenoside rg3 decreased mrna expression of srebp - 2 , a major direct transcriptional regulator of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism , in dose - and time - dependent manners ( figure 3a,b ) .
gene expression of hmgcr , which catalyzes a rate - limiting step in cholesterol synthesis , was also suppressed in a time - dependent manner ( figure 3c ) .
our results indicate that ginsenoside rg3 down - regulated srebp - 2 and hmgcr mrna expression .
consequently , inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis by down - regulating srebp - 2 and hmgcr mrna expression may be evidence for the hypothesis that ginsenoside rg3 has a hypolipidemic effect in hepg2 cells .
2.4 .
effect of ginsenoside rg3 on ampk activation ampk activation regulates energy metabolism that favors the inhibition of lipogenesis by inactivating acc - alpha and hmgcr , the key enzymes of fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis , respectively [ 14 ] .
inactivation of acc - alpha by ampk reduces malonyl - coa concentration , leading to stimulation of fatty acid oxidation concomitantly with an increase in beta - oxidation [ 24 ] .
treatment with metformin , an ampk substrate , stimulates ampk activity , which , in turn , decreases intracellular triglyceride and cholesterol contents in hepg2 cells [ 13 ] .
in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway , ampk inhibits the conversion of hmg - coa to mevalonate by down - regulating hmgcr [ 24 ] .
we treated cells with ginsenoside rg3 to investigate whether it affects ampk activity in hepg2 cells .
as a result , ampk activity increased by 1.22 - and 1.58 - fold in hepg2 cells treated with 1 and 10 mum ginsenoside rg3 , respectively , compared with that in control cells ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 4 ) .
it has been reported that ampk activation is involved in the reduction of triglyceride accumulation by rg3 during 3t3 - l1 adipocyte differentiation [ 4 ] .
similarly , a previous in vivo study showed that treatment with ginsam , which is a component of ginseng produced by vinegar extraction and enriched with ginsenoside rg3 , reduces plasma total cholesterol concentration by increasing ampk activity in obese insulin - resistant rats [ 8 ] .
our results suggest that ginsenoside rg3 may inhibit accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol with stimulating ampk activity .
a recent study demonstrated that a synthetic polyphenol , s17834 , stimulates ampk activity , inhibits srebp - 2 gene expression , and reduces expression of its own target genes , such as hmgcs and hmgcr , then down - regulates cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver [ 25 ] .
although it was found that ampk activation and down - regulation of srebp - 2 were involved in the hypolipidemic effects exerted by the rg3 , no direct correlation was presented between the ampk and srebp - 2 signaling pathways .
therefore , a possible connection between these two effects by ginsenoside rg3 should be investigated in further studies .
our results suggest that the hypolipidemic effects of ginsenoside rg3 may be caused , at least in part , by modulating the expression of srebp - 2 and ampk activation .
to our knowledge , the present study is the first to suggest that ginsenoside rg3 plays a role as a regulator of the expression of srebp - 2 and ampk activation involved in lipid metabolism in hepg2 cells .

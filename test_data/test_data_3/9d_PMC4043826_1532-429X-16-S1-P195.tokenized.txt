standard cmr stress perfusion imaging utilises 3 short axis slices , each acquired in different phases of the cardiac cycle .
recently proposed 3d myocardial perfusion cmr allows the entire myocardium to be sampled within the same cardiac phase and therefore should allow more accurate quantification of ischaemic burden without extrapolation .
in this study we compared visual ischaemia detection and quantification by 2d high resolution and 3d whole heart myocardial perfusion cmr .
methods cmr imaging was performed on a 3t philips achieva tx system .
stress ( adenosine 140 mcg / kg / min ) and rest acquisitions were performed ( gadovist 0.075 mmol / kg ) , separated by 15 min .
2d perfusion cmr used 3 slices positioned using the ' 3 of 5 ' technique ( variable gap ) and a spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence with 5 fold k - t sense acceleration , voxel size 1.06 * 1.06 * 10 mm 3 .
3d perfusion used 12 contiguous slices acquired with a 3d spoiled gradient echo sequence at mid - diastole and 10 fold k - t sense acceleration with 11 training profiles , voxel size of 2.3 * 2.3 * 5 mm 3 .
23 patients with perfusion abnormalities on 2d perfusion cmr were recalled for 3d whole heart acquisition on a separate day .
perfusion images were analysed independently by two observers .
image quality ( 4 = excellent , 3 = good , 2 = poor , 1 = uninterpretable ) and diagnostic confidence by coronary territory was graded ( 1 = high diagnostic confidence , 0 = low diagnostic confidence ) .
perfusion abnormalities were contoured in the frame of maximal remote myocardium signal intensity , and expressed as a percentage of total myocardium .
results of the 23 paired data sets , images in one 2d set were uninterpretable due to artefact , leaving 22 pairs for analysis .
image quality was excellent or good in 21 / 22 ( 95 %) for 2d and 20 / 22 ( 91 %) for 3d acquisitions .
diagnostic confidence expressed by coronary territory did not differ significantly in lad , lcx or rca [ figure 1 ] ( p = 0.12 , 1.0 and 0.74 respectively ) .
2d and 3d perfusion quantification agreed , with a mean bias on bland altman analysis of 0.7 %( r2 = 0.488 , p < 0.001 ) [ figure 2 ] .
at the 10 % threshold of ischaemic burden with either method , there was agreement in 9 of 12 sets , in non - agreement 2d quantification was greater than 3d and differed by 1.1 , 3.2 , and 10.9 % .
figure 1 diagnostic confidence by coronary territory .
figure 2 bland - altman plot , agreement of 2d vs 3d ischaemia quantification .
bias was 0.1 % ( 95 % ci - 9.2 % to 9.3 %) conclusions image quality and diagnostic confidence are similar with both high resolution 2d and whole heart 3d myocardial perfusion cmr .
no systematic bias in perfusion quantification between the two methods was detected .

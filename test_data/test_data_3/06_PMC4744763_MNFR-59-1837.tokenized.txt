scope in this study , human exposure to the mycotoxin ochratoxin a ( ota ) and its thermal degradation product 2'r - ochratoxin a ( 2'r - ota , previously named as 14r - ochratoxin a [ 22 ]) through coffee consumption was assessed .
lc - ms / ms and the dried blood spot ( dbs ) technique were used for the analysis of blood samples from coffee and noncoffee drinkers ( n = 50 ) , and food frequency questionnaires were used to document coffee consumption .
methods and results for the detection of ota and 2'r - ota in blood , a new sensitive and efficient sample preparation method based on dbs was established and validated .
using this technique 2'r - ota was for the first time detected in biological samples .
comparison between coffee drinkers and noncoffee drinkers showed for the first time that 2'r - ota was only present in blood from the first group while ota could be found in both groups in a mean concentration of 0.21 mug / l .
2'r - ota mean concentration was 0.11 mug / l with a maximum concentration of 0.414 mug / l. thus , in average 2'r - ota was approx. half the concentration of ota but in some cases even exceeded ota levels .
no correlation between the amounts of coffee consumption and ota or 2'r - ota levels was observed .
conclusion the results of this study revealed for the first time a high exposure of coffee consumers to 2'r - ota , a compound formed from ota during coffee roasting .
since little information is available regarding toxicity and possible carcinogenicity of this compound , further ota monitoring in blood including 2'r - ota is advisable .

abbreviations 2'r - ota 2'r - ochratoxin a dbs dried blood spot ffq food frequency questionnaire iac immuno affinity columns mrm multiple reaction monitoring ota ochratoxin a 1 introduction ochratoxin a ( n - [( 3r ) - ( 5 - chloro - 8 - hydroxy - 3 - methyl - 1 - oxo - 7 - isochromanyl ) carbonyl ] - l - phenylalanine , ota , fig. 1 ) is a mycotoxin produced by fungi of the genera aspergillus and penicillium 1 , 2 .
it can be found in a large variety of commodities from different climate zones .
in northern europe , especially penicillium verrucosum is responsible for ota contamination of cereals such as wheat , corn and barley 3 , while penicillium nordicum is described as a common ota producer in meat products such as salami or ham and cheese 3 , 4 .
in warmer climate zones aspergillus westerdijkiae , aspergillus carbonarius , and aspergillus ochraceus could be identified as potent ota producers in coffee 5 , cocoa 6 , grape juice , dried wine fruits 7 , spices , and other dried or fermented foods 8 , 9 .
figure 1 chemical structures of ochratoxin a ( ota ) and 2'r - ochratoxin a ( 2'r - ota ) .
ota has been shown to be nephrotoxic , genotoxic , teratogenic , and immunosuppressive in animals 10 .
furthermore , ota has been classified as a possible human carcinogen ( group 2b ) by the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc ) due to its nephrocarcinogenicity in animals 11 .
ota is able to form dna adducts after metabolic dehalogenation 12 , 13 , 14 .
the role of these adducts on the carcinogenic effect of ota is under discussion and needs to be further investigated 15 , 16 , 17 .
several studies discussed major food sources responsible for ota exposure based on the results from the analysis of food samples as well as average consumption data 18 , 19 , 20 .
for europe , cereals , coffee , beer , wine , cocoa , dried fruits , meat , and spices could be identified as the most important sources of ota 19 .
based on these data , coffee is responsible for approx. 10 % of the ota intake in germany .
considering that ota levels are in average lowered by 80 - 90 % during coffee roasting and a binding to coffee beans has been described , ota exposure due to coffee might even be higher 21 .
furthermore , 2'r - ochratoxin a ( n - [( 3r ) - ( 5 - chloro - 8 - hydroxy - 3 - methyl - 1 - oxo - 7 - isochromanyl ) carbonyl ] - d - phenylalanine , 2'r - ochratoxin a ( 2'r - ota ) , previously named as 14r - ochratoxin a , fig. 1 ) has been reported as an ota degradation product with levels in roasted coffee up to 26 % in comparison to the ota concentration 22 .
further degradation products of ota are 2 ' - decarboxy ochratoxin a and ochratoxin a amide , of which the latter one has not yet been found in coffee 22 , 23 .
so far , only cytotoxicity assays using human hepatocellular carcinoma ( hep g2 ) and immortalized human kidney epithelial cells have been performed with these degradation products : 2'r - ota is cytotoxic and induces apoptosis in nanomolar or low micromolar concentrations however it is by a factor of 10 less cytotoxic compared to ota 22 , 24 .
for the other two compounds no or much lower cytotoxicity is reported 22 , 23 .
besides the detection in food samples , several studies report the occurrence of ota in biological samples such as blood and urine .
the routine method for the analysis of ota in these matrices is based on liquid / liquid extraction with chloroform followed by direct analysis , the use of immunoaffinity columns or dispersive spe clean - up 25 , 26 , 27 .
the respective analytical procedure is usually laborious , requires expensive immunoaffinity columns or is based on halogenated solvents for extraction .
in recent years the use of dried blood spots ( dbs ) has become popular for the sample collection of human whole blood .
dried blood spots were first introduced by ivar christian bang for the determination of blood sugar levels in 1913 28 .
this sample technique achieved its breakthrough as a cheap - screening method for phenylketonuria in the 1960s 29 .
samples can be collected on paper cards by pricking toes , heels , ears , or fingers with lancets followed by punching of defined discs with sample material out of the dried cards 30 .
alternatively , blood can be spotted with a known volume from an ampoule after venous blood taking .
after drying the fresh blood , either the entire dbs is cut out or a disc of defined size is punched out and used for further preparation steps 31 .
for many analytes dbs protects against humidity , sunlight , high temperatures and can be stored for long time , providing accurate results even after years 32 , 33 , 34 .
for analysis , the dried blood samples are extracted with a selective solvent and the resulting extract is analyzed by hplc - ms / ms or other sensitive analytical techniques without any further clean - up 35 .
in the present work , the dbs technique is applied for the first time for the analysis of ota in blood samples .
additionally , it is the first approach to detect the thermal degradation product 2'r - ota in blood samples from coffee and noncoffee drinkers .
2 materials and methods 2.1 chemicals and reagents water for hplc was purified with a milliq gradient a 10 system ( millipore , schwalbach , germany ) .
the reference standards were prepared as described elsewhere 22 .
briefly ota was isolated and purified from fungal cultures .
isotope labeled d5 - ochratoxin a ( d5 - ota ) was produced by growing p. verrucosum on d5 - l - phenylalanine enriched growth medium .
2'r - ota and d5 - 2'r - ochratoxin a ( d5 - 2'r - ota ) were prepared by thermal isomerization of ota and d5 - ota , respectively .
for all compounds , stock solutions of 1 mug / ml in acetonitrile were prepared .
a working solution was prepared at 20 - fold concentration of the highest calibration point .
blood collection tubes were monovette ( r ) edta ke / 7.5ml from sarstedt ( numbrecht , germany ) .
whatman 903 protein saver cards ( tm ) for sample collection and preparation were acquired from sigma - aldrich ( taufkirchen , germany ) .
all other chemicals were purchased either from vwr ( darmstadt , germany ) or sigma - aldrich ( taufkirchen , germany ) and used without further purification .
2.2 blood samples all participants were informed about scope and aim of this study and gave written consent about their participation .
samples and food frequency questionnaires ( ffq ) were number encoded to ensure the anonymity of participants .
the design of this study was approved by the research ethical committee of the university hospital munster , germany ( file reference : 2014 - 187 - f - s ) .
participants were 29 men and 21 women between the age of 18 and > 60 years .
among the participants , 34 individuals consumed coffee within the past 30 days ( coffee drinker ) and 16 did not consume coffee within 30 days before sampling ( noncoffee drinker ) .
venous blood was taken and collected in edta - coated 7.5 ml ampoules. from every blood sample , 100 mul - spots were placed on dbs cards .
the blood spots were allowed to dry at room temperature overnight and cards stored at 4degreesc in the dark .
for analysis , the 100 mul spots were cut out and extracted for 1 h under sonication with 1 ml extraction solution consisting of water / acetone / acetonitrile ( 30:35:35 v / v / v ) and containing 0.01 ng / ml d5 - ota and 0.01 ng / ml d5 - 2'r - ota .
after extraction the filter paper was removed from the vial and the solvent evaporated at 60degreesc under reduced pressure .
the residues were reconstituted with 100 mul water / methanol / formic acid ( 60:40:0.1 v / v / v ) followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 x g and injection of 40 mul of the supernatant into the hplc - ms / ms system .
2.3 hplc - ms / ms analysis 2.3.1 hplc - ms / ms system a qtrap 6500 ms system ( sciex , darmstadt , germany ) coupled to a 1260 infinity lc system ( agilent , waldbronn , germany ) was used for the detection in multiple reaction monitoring ( mrm ) mode .
data acquisition was performed with analyst 1.6.2 software .
the chromatographic separation was carried out on a 150 x 2 mm inner diameter , 5 mum , nucleodur c18 isis column and a 2 x 4 mm guard column of the same material ( macherey - nagel , duren , germany ) at a column temperature of 40degreesc .
flow rate was 0.3 ml / min and solvent a was methanol and solvent b water , both containing 0.1 % formic acid .
the binary gradient was programmed as follows : 0 min , 60 % a ; 3 min , 60 % a ; 6 min , 100 % a ; 10 min , 100 % a ; 10.1 min , 60 % a ; 14 min , 60 % a. the mass spectrometer was operated in the positive mode .
for the electrospray ionization a voltage of + 5500 v was used , the potentials for fragmentation were set as follows : declustering potential + 35 v ; entrance potential + 8 v ; collision cell exit potential + 11 v ; and collision energy potential + 31 v. the transition reactions were monitored with duration of 100 ms each .
the selected mrm transitions for ota and 2'r - ota were m / z 404 - - > m / z 239 as quantifier and m / z 404 - - > m / z 102 as qualifier .
for d5 - ota and d5 - 2'r - ota m / z 409 - - > m / z 239 and 409 - - > m / z 102 were used as quantifier and qualifier , respectively .
2.3.2 calibration a seven - point calibration curve for ota and 2'r - ota was set in concentration range from 0.005 to 1.0 ng / ml. each calibration point contained 0.1 ng / ml of both isotope labeled standards d5 - ota and d5 - 2'r - ota .
the calibration solutions were stable over 24 h at 4degreesc .
reproducibility was determined by means of a quality control sample that was taken from the cohort , containing both ota and 2'r - ota .
it was analyzed with every sample batch and measurement was accepted if the determined concentration ranged between 80 and 120 % of the mean value .
no decrease of the ota or 2'r - ota concentrations was observed in the control sample , showing that both analytes are stable for at least four weeks when stored at 4degreesc on the dbs cards .
the recovery rates were determined for four different analyte concentrations as described below .
the loq and the lod were determined in spiked samples via the s / n with thresholds of 1 - 3 and 1 - 10 , respectively .
2.3.3 recovery rates as no human blood sample was available without detectable concentrations of ota , the sample with the lowest ota concentration of 0.096 +/ - 0.003 ng / ml and no detectable 2'r - ota was used for the determination of the recovery rates .
determination of the recovery rate was performed in triplicate at four different spiking levels .
for each concentration level 1 ml of blood was spiked with 5 to 20 mul of a solution containing ota and 2'r - ota at concentrations of either 10 ng / ml or 1 ng / ml. the resulting concentrations were 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.25 , and 1 ng / ml for both , ota and 2'r - ota .
subsequently the samples were analyzed as described above .
2.4 food frequency questionnaire the design of the ffq that was filled out by all participants of the study was based on gerding et al .
36 and covered long and short - term nutritional habits ( recall of past 30 days and 24 h recall ) .
for this study , the consumption of coffee and soluble coffee was requested in the range from 0 to 0.7 l / day and > 0.7 l / day .
the ffq was generated and automatically processed with evasys v5.1 software .
a statistical analysis was carried out to identify significant correlations between coffee consumption and ota / 2'r - ota concentrations found in blood .
samples were grouped according to the consumption frequencies stated by the participants .
for comparison , independent sample t - test was applied .
3 results 3.1 method development hplc - ms / ms analysis of ota was performed in positive ion mode with electrospray ionization under standard conditions 37 .
particular attention was paid to the column selection and the solvent gradient in order to achieve a baseline separation of ota and 2'r - ota , as both compound show identical fragmentation patterns , making a mass spectrometric differentiation impossible .
for sample preparation 100 mul of blood samples were applied on a dbs card , dried , cut out and extracted using a mixture of 35 % acetonitrile 35 % acetone 30 % water containing d5 - ota and d5 - 2'r - ota as internal standards .
the extract was evaporated to dryness , and after reconstitution and centrifugation a clear , nearly colourless extract was obtained .
for hplc - ms / ms analysis of the extract , mrm transitions m / z 404.0 - - > m / z 239.0 and m / z 404.0 - - > m / z 102.0 yielded the best sensitivity ( fig. 2 ) .
based on the s / n ratios of 3 and 10 for the least sensitive mrm transition m / z 404.0 - - > m / z 239.0 , without matrix , lod and loq were 0.005 and 0.013 ng / ml for both , ota and 2'r - ota , respectively .
as no sample without ota was available , the lod and loq in matrix could only be determined for 2'r - ota and were 0.005 and 0.021 ng / ml , respectively , which is far below the lowest ota concentration measured .
both analytes showed linear calibration curves in the respective calibration range with a coefficient of determination ( r 2 ) between 0.997 and 0.999 .
the recovery rates were determined in triplicate and ranged between 101 - 105 % for ota and 99 - 105 % for 2'r - ota at blood concentrations of 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.25 , and 1.0 ng / ml , respectively .
reproducibility was investigated by the analysis of a control sample over a period of five days and was 7.3 % for ota and 7.5 % for 2'r - ota .

gray : m / z 404.0 - - > m / z 239.0 , black : m / z 404.0 - - > m / z 102.0 .
3.2 biomonitoring in blood samples from coffee drinker and noncoffee drinker fifty blood samples from healthy adults from the area of munster , germany were analyzed using the new dbs - based method .
ota could be detected in all blood samples within a concentration range of 0.071 - 0.383 ng / ml and in a mean concentration of 0.21 +/ - 0.066 ng / ml. as shown in table 1 , no statistical difference between the ota levels in blood of coffee and noncoffee drinkers could be determined .
also between male and female no significant difference was found .
table 1 levels of ota and 2'r - ota ( ng / ml ) in blood according to gender and coffee consumption n mean +/ - sd median range ota ( ng / ml ) female 21 0.19 +/ - 0.056 0.19 0.071 - 0.302 male 29 0.23 +/ - 0.069 0.22 0.113 - 0.383 all 50 0.21 +/ - 0.066 0.21 0.071 - 0.383 coffee drinker 34 0.21 +/ - 0.067 0.21 0.071 - 0.383 noncoffee drinker 16 0.21 +/ - 0.065 0.21 0.113 - 0.325 2'r - ota ( ng / ml ) ( coffee drinker only ) male 19 0.13 +/ - 0.110 0.11 0.023 - 0.414 female 15 0.09 +/ - 0.066 0.06 0.021 - 0.271 all 34 0.11 +/ - 0.093 0.07 0.021 - 0.414 john wiley & sons , ltd .
2'r - ota could be detected in all blood samples from coffee drinkers in a range between 0.021 and 0.414 ng / ml while no 2'r - ota was found in samples from the noncoffee drinker group .
the mean concentration of 0.11 +/ - 0.093 ng / ml for 2'r - ota in the coffee drinker group is approx. half of that of ota .
however , as shown in fig. 3 , for individual samples strong variations of the ratio of ota to 2'r - ota can be observed. with some samples such as numbers 5 , 9 , and 52 having 2'r - ota concentrations even exceeding those of ota .
in the ffq , the average amount of coffee beverage consumed per day during the last month was requested .
comparison of the ota and 2'r - ota shown in fig. 4 revealed no statistical difference between the groups except for 2'r - ota , which was not found in the noncoffee drinker group .

figure 4 ota ( black ) and 2'r - ota ( gray ) concentrations [ ng / ml ] related to coffee consumption .
4 discussion in this study , an innovative , simple , and efficient method for the detection of ota and 2'r - ota in human blood samples was developed , based on the dried blood spot analysis of pharmacological active compounds 38 .
compared to liquid - liquid extraction , spe , or immuno affinity columns ( iac ) , which are currently used for the analysis of ota in blood , the new method provides essential benefits .
this clean up method can be performed simultaneously for 40 or more samples and only little waste is produced .
it is fast , omits halogenated solvents and does not require expensive clean - up cartridges .
besides ota the simultaneous analysis of 2'r - ota can be performed that is not bound by most iac columns 22 .
additionally , the use of the dbs - technique gives a possibility for simple storage and shipping of blood sample material , allowing an easy transport of samples from the blood donor to the analytical facility .
additionally , the lod and loq obtained with the new method are below or equal to those found in literature while sample consumption is minimized 26 , 27 , 39 .
recoveries around 100 % and a good repeatability confirm the suitability of the dbs technique for ota biomonitoring studies .
application of the dbs method to 50 samples from healthy adults showed a close distribution of most ota concentrations around the mean value with only few higher concentrations as shown in fig. 3. the lack of " extreme " ota blood levels can be explained by the fact that ota blood levels are primarily a long - term marker for ota exposure and not so much influenced by a single high dose 40 , 41 .
on the other hand , it is rather unlikely that the participants consumed regularly highly contaminated food as ota regulation is comparably strict in germany and europe .
thus the determined mean concentrations given in table 1 are in good agreement with previously published concentrations of 0.28 and 0.23 ng / ml for adults in germany 39 , 42 .
comparison of the ota concentrations in the blood samples from coffee and noncoffee drinkers showed no significant ( p > 0.05 ) difference in the mean concentration as shown in fig. 4. in germany cereals ( 0.65 ng / kg bw / day ) , coffee ( 0.14 ng / kg bw / day ) , beer ( 0.05 ng / kg bw / day ) , cocoa ( 0.07 ng / kg bw / day ) , and meat ( 0.06 ng / kg bw / day ) are the most important sources for ota exposure 19 .
thus based on the calculated impact of coffee consumption on the overall intake of ota as well as the concentrations of 2'r - ota found in roasted coffee , only trace amounts of 2'r - ota were expected to be found in blood .
instead , among the samples analyzed , some contained even higher concentrations of 2'r - ota than ota .
possible explanations for this effect could be that more ota and 2'r - ota are present in coffee than detected with the current methods .
this possible masking could be due to matrix binding and release of ota and 2'r - ota in the gastrointestinal tract 21 .
however , in this case we would expect that also higher levels of ota can be found in the blood from coffee drinkers , which is not the case .
alternatively , a reduced excretion or an enhanced resorption of 2'r - ota compared to ota could be a reason for this effect .
compared to ota that already has a biological half - life - time of approx. 35 days 17 , this would indicate a very high persistence of 2'r - ota in the body .
further sources of 2'r - ota were not identified in the study , but can also not be excluded .
strong interindividual differences in the 2'r - ota levels were observed .
explanations for this effect could be related to coffee processing , coffee quality or differences in the metabolism of 2'r - ota but need to be further investigated .
5 summary and conclusion a dbs - based sample preparation technique for the detection of ota and its thermal degradation product 2'r - ota in blood was developed and validated .
due to the use of dbs , the new method simplifies sample treatment and allows the storage of samples for ota analysis as well as shipping with almost no restriction compared to fresh blood samples .
furthermore , sample clean - up is simplified and accelerated compared to published procedures .
the new technique was applied for the analysis of blood samples from coffee consumers and noncoffee consumers in germany .
besides ota its thermal degradation product 2'r - ota was analyzed for the first time in physiological samples .
while no significant differences in the ota levels between both groups were observed , 2'r - ota was found in all blood from coffee drinkers in levels up to 0.414 ng / ml , exceeding even the highest ota concentration of 0.383 ng / ml detected in the study .
in average , 2'r - ota concentration was 0.11 ng / ml , which is half of the mean ota concentration of 0.21 ng / ml , and thus much higher than expected , considering the levels of 2'r - ota typically found in roasted coffee and the limited impact of roasted coffee on the overall ota exposure .
as 2'r - ota is cytotoxic in cell culture in the nanomolar or low micromolar range ( although less cytotoxic compared to ota ) and no additional information about the toxicity and toxicokinetics of this compound is available , further research is needed to understand the relevance / contribution of this compound for human exposure to mycotoxins .
ota biomonitoring studies that include 2'r - ota are advisable .

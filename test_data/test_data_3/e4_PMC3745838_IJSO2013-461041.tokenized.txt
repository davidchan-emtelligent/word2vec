our aim was to evaluate the quality of life following cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy for pseudomyxoma peritonei .
we also conducted an analysis of all patients who underwent crs and hipec for pseudomyxoma peritonei from 1997 to 2012. methods .
we contacted 87 patients using the fact c ( version 4 ) quality of life questionnaire , and facit - ts - g ( version 1 ) was also used. results .
a total of 63 patients ( response rate 72 %) were available for quality of life interview and analysis .
the median time from surgery to questionnaire evaluation was 31 months ( range 6 - 161 months ) .
62 % were females with an average age of 54 years .
22 % of the patients had over one cytoreductive surgical procedure .
we analysed our patients postoperatively based on physical , functional , social , and emotional well being who reported favourable outcomes in all sections .
patients who had a single procedure had a significantly higher score ( p = 0.016 ) in the additional concerns section of the questionnaire .
the patients who had a single procedure had better gastrointestinal digestion in terms of bowel control , appetite , and food digestion and also body appearance scoring. conclusions .
79 % of the patients stated that they would undergo further cytoreductive surgery and that redo procedures do not result in a significantly worse quality of life .
1. introduction as a result of pioneering work by sugarbaker , cytoreductive surgery ( crs ) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( hipec ) have become the mainstay of treatment for pseudomyxoma peritonei ( pmp ) [ 1 ] .
appendiceal neoplasms are uncommon making up 1 % of colorectal malignancies [ 2 ] .
epithelial appendiceal neoplasms frequently present with mucinous ascites and tumour implants throughout the abdomen .
most cases of pmp result from rupture of a low grade appendiceal tumour with mucin accumulating in the abdominal cavity due to its production by epithelial cells .
pmp results in death via obliteration of the peritoneal cavity even though there are little haematogenous or lymph node metastases .
in the past , pmp was attempted to be treated with repeated debulking procedures ; however , this resulted in recurrence and death secondary to bowel obstruction , surgical complications , or terminal starvation [ 3 ] .
the macroscopic disease of pmp is targeted by surgical cytoreduction and the microscopic by intraperitoneal chemotherapy .
it is a curative treatment option with many centres publishing successful data [ 4 - 9 ] .
a major past criticism of cytoreductive surgery has been the associated morbidity and mortality .
the only effective treatment of pmp is crs and hipec with achievable survival and a good quality of life [ 10 - 12 ] .
our aim in this study was to evaluate the quality of life in patients undergoing crs and hipec for pmp at our institution .
2. method an analysis of all patients who underwent crs and hipec for pseudomyxoma peritonei from 1997 to 2012 was carried out from a prospective database from the peritoneal surface malignancy program in st. george hospital , sydney , nsw , australia .
currently , this is the main centre for crs / hipec in the southern hemisphere .
crs and hipec were carried out as per the sugarbaker technique [ 13 ] with eighty percent of patients who responded to the questionnaire receiving epic ( early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy ) in our high dependency or intensive care unit .
preoperative patients are assessed at st. george hospital and discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting prior to surgery with referrals received internationally and from across australia .
we analysed demographics from this database ( one hundred and fifty three patients ) including operative time , peritoneal carcinomatosis index ( pci ) , transfusion requirements , length of stay , and postoperative complications .
also included were thirty - eight patients who had undergone a required repeat procedure .
in 2010 , we attempted to contact eighty - seven patients - - number of patients alive at that time following crs and hipec for pmp .
we had a seventy - two percent response rate .
fifty - one patients responded via telephone and twelve via postal questionnaire .
a subset of data was analysed from those who responded to the questionnaire looking at those who had repeated procedures carried out .
we compared length of stay , operative times , pci , transfusion requirements , and postoperative complications between the groups .
the fact c ( version 4 ) quality of life questionnaire that included pwb ( physical well being ) , sfwb ( social / family well being ) , ewb ( emotional well being ) , fwb ( functional well being ) , and ac ( additional concerns ) was utilized with the addition of facit - ts - g ( version 1 ) .
statistical analysis was carried out comparing two groups using a t - test two - tailed distribution with paired / two sample equal variance / unequal variance where appropriate .
statistical significance was a p value < 0.05 .
the qol scores were described using means and standard deviations .
3. results there were 209 procedures ( 153 patients ) who underwent crs and hipec from 1997 to 2012 .
38 % of the patients were males and 62 % females .
since 1997 , there have been twenty - three deaths ( 15 % mortality over fifteen years ) in total following crs and hipec for pmp. with regard to our mortality cases , the mean age was fifty - five years and the mean time since surgery and mortality was twenty - three months .
in this group , there were eight patients that had undergone repeated procedures .
the median time from surgery to questionnaire evaluation was 31 months ( range 6 - 161 months ) .
there was a significant difference in pci , operative time , and hdu stay between the patients following a single procedure and redo cases demonstrated in table 1 .
3.1 .
postoperative complications 1997 - 2012 postoperative complications are outlined in table 2 .
there is no significant difference between groups p = 0.08 .
there was a higher percentage of patients who had grades 0 ( 21 % versus 10 %) , 2 ( 41 % versus 39 %) , and 4 ( 23 % versus 22 %) morbidities following a redo procedure versus a single procedure .
3.2 .
quality of life questionnaire responders 1997 - 2010 all eighty - seven patients alive at the time of the study who had undergone crs and hipec for pmp from 1997 to 2010 were contacted .
fifty - one were contacted via telephone , and those who could not be contacted received a postal questionnaire .
in total , we had a 72 % response rate - - sixty - three patients in total .
80 % of the cases studied also had postoperative epic ( early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy ) .
there was a significant difference between patients ( 55 % males ) following a single procedure and those who had a repeat procedure in terms of pci , high dependency unit length of stay , and transfusion requirements .
table 3 outlines patients' details who responded to the questionnaire .
complications are outlined in table 4 .
the infection rate and pneumothorax rate were the only significant difference in terms of postoperative complications found between those patients who had a single versus a repeat procedure .
there was a higher percentage of patients who had grades 0 ( 29 % versus 16 %) and grade 2 ( 53 % versus 38 %) morbidities following a redo procedure versus a single procedure .
single procedures had higher grades 3 ( 27 versus 12 %) and 4 ( 17 versus 6 %) morbidities .
patients reported a favourable quality of life following crs and hipec even after a redo procedure as outlined in table 5 ( a ) .
3.3 .
quality of life questionnaire : results there is no significant difference in quality of life scores between patients who had a single versus redo procedure .
4. discussion qol assessment is essential in patients undergoing crs and hipec as the procedure carries an associated degree of morbidity and mortality .
long - term disease - free survival is achievable , and if redo procedures are necessary , they can be undertaken successfully .
we now have a curative approach in our management with modern treatment achieving survival rates of 59 to 96 % at five years [ 11 ] and 70 % at twenty years ; however , with this treatment , a significant morbidity has to be acknowledged [ 2 ] .
our survival rate was 85 % at fifteen years .
in our study , the mean time from surgery to responding to the questionnaire was thirty - one months .
previous studies have demonstrated postoperative morbidity , with low scores from a physical and functional well being postoperatively increasing to baseline at 3 , 6 , and 12 months [ 14 ] .
long - term followup of these patients was analysed three to eight years after treatment illustrating a 28 % survival rate with 63 % responding with a good quality of life [ 15 ] .
in the past , repeated debulking procedures were the only option necessary for symptomatic relief of pmp and had a median survival of two years [ 15 ] .
the european organization for research and treatment of cancer qol questionnaire collected four years ( range 1 - 8 years ) following surgery suggested impaired qol during the first 6 - 12 months following surgery and a return to satisfactory qol thereafter .
hill et al. concluded that , after 3 to 6 months , patients with colorectal carcinomatosis had a return to preoperative function [ 16 - 18 ] .
quality of life returns to baseline at four months and improves greatly at eight and twelve months as illustrated in a study by tuttle et al. ; however , this was following crs / hipec due to pathology of colonic origin [ 19 ] .
similar patterns were observed in patients following surgery for pseudomyxoma peritonei [ 20 ] .
the overall grade iii / iv morbidity rates for this procedure have been shown to be between 7 % and 66 % [ 19 , 21 - 25 ] .
a uk study demonstrated grade iii / iv morbidity in 9 % of patients [ 26 ] .
44 % of our responders who had a single procedure and 18 % who had a repeat procedure carried out had a morbidity grade of iii / iv. debulking procedures have a recognised risk of bowel injury and fistula formation due to progressive thickening of intra - abdominal adhesions [ 2 , 3 ] .
some patients have been shown having debulking procedures that with repeated procedures there can be a transition from a less to a more aggressive histopathologic type [ 12 ] .
we had an 11 % fistula rate in responding patients following a single crs / hipec and 12 % in those following redo procedures with no significant difference between the groups .
the procedure carries an acceptable gastrointestinal morbidity compared to pancreatic duodenectomy , gastrectomy for cancer , or other multiorgan resections , with pci being the only independent risk factor for gastrointestinal complications [ 27 , 28 ] .
postoperative gastrointestinal complaints were analysed in our study - - 77 % had no abdominal pain or cramps , 89 % reported a good appetite ( score 2 - 4 ) , and , of the 25 % of patients with a stoma , 63 % did not have any problems catering for it .
27 % reported experiencing a lack of energy ( score 2 - 4 ) , 4.7 % experienced some pain , and 89 % had no nausea on followup .
overall , 62 % of the patients were happy with the appearance of their body .
92 % had good family support and 90 % good emotional support from friends .
100 % of the patients were happy with how they were coping with their illness .
41 % worried about dying to some degree and 60 % worried that their condition would worsen .
when questioned regarding depression , 48 % stated that they did not feel sad , 33 % a little bit , and 18 % somewhat .
90 % of the patients feel that they can work including at home with a score of 1 to 4 and 84 % found good job satisfaction .
100 % of the patients could enjoy life to some degree score [ 1 - 4 ] .
98 % of the patients have accepted their illness with 100 % content with their quality of life with a score of 1 to 4.98 % felt that the treatment was right for them and were satisfied with the results .
95 % would recommend the treatment to others and 98 % rated the overall treatment ( good / very good / excellent ) .
redo procedures had a significantly lower pci with no significant difference in transfusion requirements , length of stay , or operative time .
overall , patients reported a favourable qol .
when we compared quality of life scores in those who had a single versus a redo procedure , the patients who had a single procedure had a significantly higher score ( p = 0.016 ) in the additional concerns section of the questionnaire .
the patients who had a single procedure had better gastrointestinal digestion in terms of bowel control , appetite , and food digestion and also body appearance scoring .
in conclusion , 79 % of our patients stated that they would undergo further crs / hipec if required , including patients who had experienced such a requirement previously , and 13 % were undecided at the time of the study .
our limitations in this study are that we have not carried out a premorbid assessment and that there is a nonprogressive followup at three to six monthly intervals .
further research possibly a multicentre trial with a systematic evaluation at several time intervals is required postoperatively to improve our ability to enhance our patient 's qol in the future .
conflict of interests there is no conflict of interests to declare .

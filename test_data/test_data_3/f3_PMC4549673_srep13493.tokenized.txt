hpaiv develop from low - pathogenic precursors by acquisition of a polybasic ha cleavage site ( hacs ) , the prime virulence determinant .
beside that hacs , other adaptive changes accumulate in those precursors prior to transformation into an hpaiv .
here , we aimed to unravel such virulence determinants in addition to the ha gene .
stepwise reduction of hpaiv genes revealed that the hpaiv ha and na form a minimum set of virulence determinants , sufficient for a lethal phenotype in chicken .
abolishing the na stalk deletion considerably reduced lethality and prevented transmission .
conversely , the analogous stalk deletion reconstructed in the na of an lpaiv reassortant carrying only the hpaiv ha resulted in 100 % lethality both after primary and contact infection .
remarkably , the unmodified lpaiv na with its long stalk , when exclusively introduced into the h5n1 hpaiv , still enabled high virulence and efficient transmission .
therefore , irrespective of an na stalk deletion , minor virulence determinants in addition to the essential polybasic hacs contribute to high virulence , whereas the na stalk deletion alone may serve as major virulence determinant .
highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses ( hpaiv ) cause devastating losses in poultry world - wide and raise concerns about a novel pandemic due to repeated zoonotic transmissions to humans1 .
these strains develop from low - pathogenic precursors specifying the hemagglutinin ( ha ) serotypes h5 or h7 .
hpaiv carry a polybasic ha cleavage site ( hacs ) 2345 whereas the ha of all low - pathogenic avian viruses ( lpaiv ) and human influenza viruses carry a mono - or dibasic motif678910 .
in hpaiv , the polybasic hacs is the prime virulence determinant essential for high pathogenicity in chicken ; its conversion to a monobasic motif renders the virus low - pathogenic911 .
conversely , introduction of a polybasic hacs into lpaiv of several ha serotypes does not necessarily result in high virulence12131415 .
interestingly , four natural h5 strains with polybasic hacs but low pathogenicity in chickens were found16 .
furthermore , lpaiv single - gene reassortants carrying an hpaiv ha display variable levels of virulence121317 .
the reciprocal gene constellation , i.e. an lpaiv ha with engineered polybasic hacs plus the other seven gene segments from an hpaiv caused highly pathogenic phenotypes even in case of a nonh5 / h7 ha121317 .
moreover , specific gene constellations involving pb2 , pb1 , and np may enable high virulence18 .
taken together , those findings revealed that , besides the essential polybasic hacs , additional virulence determinants reside in ha and the other seven genes .
such additional adaptive changes might accumulate in the low - pathogenic precursors during their circulation in gallinaceous poultry prior to an hpaiv outbreak2345 .
in this study , we aim to elucidate those additional virulence determinants of all nonha genes .
results selection reveals that hpaiv pb2 , ha , np , na , and m confer high virulence to reveal hpaiv gene constellations sufficient for high virulence , we performed selection experiments with the genes of hpaiv a / swan / germany / r65 / 2006 ( h5n1 ) ( r65 ) versus those of lpaiv a / teal / germany / wv632 / 2005 ( h5n1 ) ( tg05 ) .
to this end , we co - transfected plasmids encoding the r65 and tg05 genes , used the resulting supernatants for infection of chickens , took oral swabs and screened them for reassortant genotypes .
since we already could demonstrate that the introduction of the r65 ha into the genetic background of tg05 ( reassortant tg05 - har65 ) leads to 100 % morbidity and 30 % lethality in chicken12 , we omitted the tg05 ha but retained the r65 ha. first , to narrow selection to the small r65 genes ( na , m , and ns ) , we co - transfected the tg05 polymerase gene plasmids ( pb2 , pb1 , pa , np ) and the r65 ha plasmid together with mixtures of the na , m , and ns plasmids originating both from tg05 and r65 .
sanger sequencing of the post - transfection supernatant indicated the simultaneous presence of the na and m genes from both tg05 and r65 plus the presence of the tg05 ns gene ( fig. 1a ) .
oculonasal infection of ten chickens with this post - transfection mixture resulted in death of all animals by day 3 ( fig. 2a ) .
genotyping of 30 isolated plaques from oral swabs taken on days 2 and 3 from three animals (# 1 , # 3 ( which died and therefore was swabbed on day 2 only ) , and # 4 ; ten plaques each ) revealed a preference for the r65 na and m genes ( except one plaque from animal # 4 containing the r65 na but the tg05 m ) or , in another animal (# 2 from which only one plaque could be isolated ) , the presence of the r65 na gene only .
to allow for selection of all r65 genes , we then co - transfected the tg05 plasmids except the ha plasmid together with all eight r65 plasmids .
sanger sequencing of the post - transfection supernatant revealed mixtures of the pb2 , pb1 , np , na , and m genes , whereas pa and ns appeared to originate from tg05 predominantly ( fig. 1b ) .
oculonasal infection of chickens with the post - transfection supernatant resulted in death of all ten animals on day 3 post infection except animal # 10 which already succumbed to death on day 2 ( fig. 2b ) .
we then isolated plaques from oral swabs taken on day 2 from animals # 2 and # 10 .
the genotyping of five plaques from animal # 2 and one from animal # 10 indicated the presence of the tg05 pb1 , pa , and ns1 genes and ( in addition to the ha ) of the pb2 , np , na , m genes from r65 .
to investigate whether this gene composition confers high virulence , we reconstituted the reassortant tg05 - ha / pb2 / np / na / mr65 by reverse genetics to infect chickens .
all directly infected animals died on days 3 - 4 and the contact animals succumbed to death on days 5 - 7 , indicating a virulence equivalent to that of r65 ( fig. 3 ) .
taken together , the screening for random reassortant genotypes shed by chickens infected with supernatants after co - transfection with tg05 / r65 plasmid mixtures indicated that , in addition to the r65 ha , the pb2 , np , na , and m form an optimal gene combination enabling high virulence like the parent virus r65 .
stepwise reduction of hpaiv genes reveals that r65 ha plus na are sufficient for high virulence and transmission to identify the specific hpaiv genes conferring high virulence , we generated tailored reassortants from hpaiv r65 and lpaiv tg05 by reverse genetics19 .
since introduction of the r65 ha into the genetic background of tg05 resulted in 100 % morbidity and 30 % lethality in chicken ( reassortant tg05 - har65 in12 ) , we stepwise replaced several tg05 genes in tg05 - har65 by their r65 counterparts yielding these reassortants : tg05 - ha / pb2 / pb1 / pa / npr65 contains the tg05 na , m , and ns genes and the r65 ha plus polymerase complex genes ( pb2 , pb1 , pa , and np ) , whereas reassortant tg05 - ha / na / m / nsr65 carries the ha plus the na , m , and ns genes from r65 but the polymerase complex genes of tg05 .
oculonasal inoculation of ten chickens with 105 pfu of tg05 - ha / pb2 / pb1 / pa / npr65 resulted in a lethality of 30 % like tg05 - har6512 indicating that the r65 polymerase complex alone does not confer high virulence .
in contrast , the reciprocal " small " gene reassortant tg05 - ha / na / m / nsr65 exhibited 100 % lethality resembling r65 .
furthermore , the 2.9 days ( d ) mean death time ( mdt ) of tg05 - ha / na / m / nsr65 is close to that of r65 with 3.8 d ( range 3 - 5 d , six animals ) ( table 1 , fig. 3 ) , indicating that the r65 ha , na , m or ns genes are sufficient for a highly pathogenic phenotype .
to identify which of the r65 na , m or ns gene ( s ) is responsible for high virulence , we infected chickens with the three triple reassortants tg05 - ha / na / mr65 , tg05 - ha / na / nsr65 , tg05 - ha / m / nsr65 , or the double reassortant tg05 - har65nar65 .
tg05 - ha / na / mr65 and tg05 - ha / na / nsr65 displayed 100 % lethality with increased mdt of 3.6 d and 5.2 d , respectively , suggesting a decrease in virulence compared to the quadruple reassortant tg05 - ha / na / m / nsr65 ( mdt 2.9 d ) ( table 1 ) .
in contrast , replacement of the r65 na gene by that of tg05 as in tg05 - ha / m / nsr65 resulted in death of only three of eight animals similar to tg05 - har6512 , indicating a crucial role of the na for high virulence in r65 ( table 1 ) .
correspondingly , the ha / na reassortant tg05 - har65nar65 ( which differs from tg05 - har65 only by the r65 na ) displays 100 % lethality , although at a prolonged mdt of 5.9 d ( range 5 - 7 d ) , proving that introduction of the r65 na gene into tg05 - har65 resulted in a highly pathogenic phenotype ( table 1 ) .
since m , ns or the polymerase complex contribute to the high virulence of r65 to a very limited extent only in the presence of the r65 na , the na represents a major virulence determinant .
to investigate the impact of the r65 na and m on virus transmission , we infected six chickens with the reassortants tg05 - ha / na / mr65 or tg05 - har65nar65 and added four contact animals after one day .
in both groups , all primarily infected animals died on days 4 to 6 .
all contact animals succumbed to death on days 7 to 8 with tg05 - ha / na / mr65 and days 8 to 9 with tg05 - har65nar65 ( fig. 3 ) .
to investigate whether all other r65 genes combined but except the na can confer high virulence , we replaced the na in r65 by that of tg05 resulting in the reassortant r65 - natg05 .
oculonasal infection of chickens resulted in 100 % mortality both in the primarily infected and the contact animals ( fig. 3 ) , in contrast to tg05 - ha / m / nsr65 displaying a mortality of 37.5 % ( table 1 ) .
thus , in the absence of the r65 na , the ha , m , and ns can only confer a highly pathogenic phenotype in conjunction with the polymerase genes of r65 .
on the other hand , r65 ha and na alone are sufficient for high virulence and transmission .
na stalk deletion plus polybasic hacs form a minimal set of virulence determinants after having shown that the r65 ha and na alone are sufficient for a highly pathogenic phenotype , we addressed the question whether the stalk deletion of the r65 na , increasingly found in contemporary h5n1 hpaiv20 , is crucial for high virulence and virus transmission .
to this end , we generated two different na mutant viruses .
removal of amino acids ( aa ) 49 to 68 in the tg05 na stalk region resulted in the same stalk deletion as in the na of r65 ; this na mutant plasmid was used to rescue tg05 - har65nashort - tg05 .
for a mirror - imaged virus mutant , we inserted amino acids 49 - 68 from the tg05 na into the stalk region of the r65 na to rescue tg05 - har65nalong - r65 .
after infection of six chickens with 105 pfu and addition of 4 contact animals one day later , tg05 - har65nalong - r65 caused death in four of six animals and no symptoms in the contact animals ( fig. 4 ) .
however , tg05 - har65nashort - tg05 in striking contrast to tg05 - har65 ( 30 % lethality ) ( table 1 ) , displayed 100 % lethality both in the primarily infected and the contact animals demonstrating high virulence and efficient transmission ( fig. 4 ) .
therefore , in r65 the na stalk deletion is a major but non - essential virulence determinant which , together with r65 ha carrying a polybasic cleavage site , is sufficient to confer high virulence on tg05 .
discussion hpaiv evolve from low - pathogenic precursors by acquisition of a polybasic hacs4 which is not per se sufficient for high virulence121314151617 .
prior to the emergence of hpaiv , those precursor strains often circulate in gallinaceous poultry thereby accumulating mutational changes2345 .
in this study , we aimed to elucidate the genetic determinants which in addition to those of the ha gene facilitate the transformation of lpaiv into hpaiv by two approaches .
first , to reveal minimal gene constellations conferring high virulence , we selected random reassortants by co - transfection of plasmids from both the hpaiv r65 ( h5n1 ) and lpaiv tg05 ( h5n1 ) followed by infection of chickens .
in contrast to the classical technique to obtain reassortants by double - infection2122 , this approach allowed us to exclude specific viral genes by omitting the respective plasmids .
infection of chickens with the supernatant after co - transfection of plasmids coding for all eight r65 but seven tg05 genes without ha resulted in 100 % lethality .
orally shed reassortants carried the r65 pb2 , np , ha , na , and m genes , whereas the pb1 , pa and ns genes originated from tg05 .
reconstitution of this genotype by reverse genetics led to an hpaiv undistinguishable from r65 .
this finding suggests that the tg05 pb1 , pa , and ns genes do not require further adaptation , whereas a highly pathogenic phenotype is conferred by the r65 ha plus the pb2 , np , na , and m genes .
secondly , we investigated specific reassortants from r65 and tg05 in chicken .
stepwise reduction of the r65 genes beginning with reassortant tg05 - ha / na / m / nsr65 resulted in prolonged mean death times indicating limited contribution of the r65 polymerase , m , and ns genes to virulence ( table 1 ) .
remarkably , the r65 polymerase and np , or the m and ns genes on their own were not sufficient for high virulence .
such subtle changes in virulence are likely not reflected by the intravenous pathogenicity index test23 since the intravenous inoculation ensures standardization but bypasses infection of the natural target tissues .
in contrast , high lethality and efficient transmission of the single - gene reassortant r65 - natg05 demonstrates that beside ha , the r65 polymerase including np plus the m and ns genes yield an hpaiv .
on the other hand , high virulence was conferred by the r65 ha and na genes alone ( reassortant tg05 - har65nar65 ) .
we then investigated whether the na stalk deletion in r65 is crucial for high virulence and transmission to contact animals .
repairing the stalk deletion led to reduced virulence and prevented transmission , whereas introduction of the na stalk deletion into the tg05 na as in the mutant tg05 - har65nashort - tg05 increased lethality and transmission to 100 % compared with its parental virus tg05 - har65 displaying 30 % lethality12 .
this finding reveals that in the presence of an hpaiv ha with polybasic hacs , virulence determinants , already present in lpaiv , like the na stalk deletion24252627 alone may support the transformation to a highly pathogenic phenotype .
current understanding on functional consequences of the na stalk deletion is still limited .
an elevated vmax at a nearly unaffected km has been demonstrated in case of a small substrate28 .
however , the ability of the virus to elute from agglutinated erythrocytes and to penetrate mucus on cells of mammalian origin is reduced2829 .
remarkably , the na stalk deletion is detrimental for virus replication in ducks30 but shifts the viral tropism from the intestinal to the respiratory tract in chicken27 .
correspondingly , the na stalk deletion is considered an adaptation of low - pathogenic avian strains from waterfowl to domestic poultry , in particular to chicken27 .
in general , the pairwise comparison of an hpaiv versus its putative low - pathogenic precursor may be limited to only a partial subset of a concealed set of virulence determinants , all together conferring high virulence .
such a complete set may be formed by an na stalk deletion as a major but non - essential plus the polybasic hacs as the prime and essential virulence determinant .
however , without the na stalk deletion , a highly pathogenic phenotype is displayed by the reassortant r65 - natg05 which in addition to the r65 ha carries the r65 polymerase and np genes together with the r65 m and ns genes .
thus , the aa exchanges of those genes can be considered an alternative set of minor virulence determinants among which a single exchange contributes to the virulence to only a minute extent .
therefore , hpaiv like r65 may contain at least two different sets of virulence determinants .
taken together , hpaiv require an adapted ha with polybasic hacs as essential plus either several adaptive aa changes in polymerase , np , m , and na genes as minor virulence determinants or an na stalk deletion as major virulence determinant .
methods cells and recombinant viruses madin - darby canine kidney ( mdck ) cells were cultivated in minimal essential medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum .
plasmids encoding the gene segments of strains a / swan / germany / r65 / 2006 ( h5n1 ) ( r65 ) ( genbank accession numbers dq464354 - dq464361 ) and a / teal / germany / wv632 / 2005 ( h5n1 ) ( tg05 ) ( genbank accession numbers cy061882 - 9 ) have been described1217 .
to obtain specific reassortants ( 1 mug each plasmid ) or mixtures of random reassortants ( 1 mug each tg05 plasmid and 0.1 mug each r65 plasmid12 ) by co - transfection , we rescued recombinant viruses as described and propagated them in 11 - day - old embryonated chicken eggs or mdck cells913 .
gene composition of recombinant viruses was verified by sanger - sequencing of rt - pcr amplicons obtained from viral rna .
plaque assays were performed on mdck cells in the presence of 2 mug / ml n - tosyl - l - phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone ( tpck ) - treated trypsin ( sigma , taufkirchen , germany ) or in the absence of any exogenous protease .
all viruses were handled under bsl3 + conditions .
mutagenesis of na stalk to generate a stalk deletion in the tg05 na ( genbank accession number cy061887 ) like that in the r65 na ( genbank accession number dq464355 ) , we removed nucleotides 165 - 224 corresponding to aa 49 - 68 .
to elongate the stalk region of r65 na , we inserted nucleotides 165 - 224 from the tg05 na gene between nucleotides 164 and 165 of the r65 na. those modifications were introduced by site - directed quikchange mutagenesis ( primer sequences available on request ) .
animal experiments the animal experiments were evaluated by the responsible ethics committee of the state office for agriculture , food safety and fishery in mecklenburg - western pomerania ( lalff m - v ) and gained governmental approval ( registration number lallf m - v / tsd / 7221.3 - 1.1 - 018 / 07 ) .
four - to eight - weeks - old white leghorn specific - pathogen - free chickens ( lohmann , cuxhaven , germany ) were infected oculonasally with 105 pfu virus , observed daily for clinical symptoms and classified according to the oie guidelines23 as healthy ( 0 ) , ill ( 1 ) ( exhibiting one of the following : respiratory symptoms , depression , diarrhea , cyanosis , edema , or central nervous symptoms ) , severely ill ( 2 ) ( severe or more than one of the previously mentioned symptoms ) , or dead ( 3 ) .
the daily clinical score is the arithmetic mean of individual values .
moribund birds were euthanized according to23 .
the clinical score was calculated by dividing the sum of daily scores ( arithmetic mean of the individual scores ) by the number of the observation days ( 10 days ) .
oral swab samples taken on days 2 - 3 were subjected to plaque assay on mdck cells31 ; from picked plaques , viral rna was isolated and sequences were determined after rt - pcr .
for transmission studies , six chickens were infected oculonasally on day 0 .
the birds were kept in cages of 123 cm length , 65 cm width , and 77 cm height ; the bottom was cleaned daily .

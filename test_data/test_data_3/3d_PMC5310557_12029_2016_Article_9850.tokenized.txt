purpose the aim of this study is to determine overall survival , disease - specific survival and stoma - free survival after treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus with chemoradiotherapy followed by brachytherapy or electron boost in a recent cohort of patients .
methods fifty - two patients ( median age 62 years ) were treated with radical chemoradiotherapy ( mitomycin c , infusional 5 - fluorouracil concurrently with conformal radical radiotherapy 45 gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks ) followed by a radiotherapy boost between 1 december 2000 and 30 april 2011 .
follow - up was to 30 november 2014 .
thirty - six patients received a boost ( 15 - 20 gy ) over 2 days with 192ir needle brachytherapy for anal canal tumours , and 16 patients received electron beam therapy ( 20 gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks ) for anal margin tumours .
a defunctioning stoma was only created prior to chemoradiotherapy for fistula or severe anal pain .
results the overall survival for the 36 patients treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by brachytherapy was 75 % ( 95 % ci , 61 - 89 ) at 5 years , the disease - specific survival was 91 % ( 95 % ci , 81 - 101 %) , and the stoma - free survival was 97 % ( 95 % ci , 91 - 103 %) all at 5 years .
for the 16 patients treated with an electron boost for anal margin tumours , the 5 - year overall survival , disease - specific survival and stoma - free survival were 68 % ( 95 % ci , 44 - 92 %) , 78 % ( 95 % ci , 56 - 100 %) and 80 % ( 95 % ci , 60 - 100 %) , respectively .
conclusions a very low stoma formation rate can be obtained with radical chemoradiotherapy followed by a brachytherapy boost for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal but not with an electron boost for anal margin tumours .
keywords anal cancer stoma formation boost brachytherapy electron beam therapy radiotherapy eric michael bessellissue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media new york 2017 introduction squamous cell carcinoma ( scc ) of the anus is caused predominantly ( 84 %) by human papilloma virus ( hpv 16 ) in comparison to cervical carcinoma ( 70 %) ( hpv 16 and 18 ) and oropharyngeal carcinoma ( 33 %) ( hpv 16 ) [ 1 ] .
in contrast to the high doses of radical radiotherapy ( 65 - 70 gy ) used in the chemoradiotherapy of cervical carcinoma and oropharyngeal carcinoma , recent trials particularly in the uk act ii trial [ 2 ] have established that doses of 50.4 gy in 28 daily fractions combined with mitomycin c and 5 - fluorouracil give a 3 - year progression - free survival of 80 % for t1 or t2 disease but 65 % for t3 or t4 disease .
similarly , the 3 - year colostomy - free survival was 84 % for t1 or t2 disease and 61 % for patients with t3 or t4 disease .
in the rtog 98 - 11 trial [ 3 ] published in 2008 , in which a radiotherapy boost of 10 - 14 gy in 2 gy fractions was given for locally advanced disease ( total 55 - 59 gy ) , the 5 - year colostomy - free survival was 90 % in the mitomycin - based group .
european guidelines for diagnosis , treatment , and follow - up of anal cancer have recently been published [ 4 ] .
the results of chemoradiotherapy with brachytherapy or electron therapy boost in nottingham , uk ( 2000 - 2011 ) , for locally advanced scc of the anus were analysed to determine overall survival , disease - specific survival and stoma - free survival .
the patients were treated during the modern era with discussion of patients at a multidisciplinary team meeting and treatment by a specialist surgeon and oncologist .
methods all patients referred to nottingham city hospital , uk , between 1 december 2000 and 30 april 2011 for chemo / radiotherapy for scc of the anal canal or margin were identified .
no patient was documented with hiv infection .
these patients had all been discussed at the colorectal cancer multi - disciplinary team meetings ( which started in the year 2000 ) held at queens medical centre , nottingham , which included patients with anal cancer .
these patients were recorded on an electronic database .
all patients gave informed written consent to treatment .
the project was considered by the nottingham research ethics committee as an audit and hence was ethically approved as part of a cohort of audits undertaken at the time by nottingham university hospital nhs trust .
an individual ethical assessment of this project was not deemed necessary .
in addition , ethical approval was obtained from trent cancer registry to access data on patients with anal cancer .
the lead surgeon , j. scholefield , and the lead oncologist , e. bessell , were responsible for treating the vast majority of these patients .
all the patients were treated using standard departmental protocols ( no extra treatments or investigations were carried out ) .
the staging investigations were as follows : the local extent of the anal cancer was determined by digital examination and proctoscopy .
the position of the tumour in the lithotomy position was recorded with 12 o'clock representing the anterior position and 6 o'clock representing the posterior position .
the distance from the anal verge was measured and also the length of the tumour .
magnetic resonance imaging and endorectal ultrasound examination were not used .
all patients had a ct scan of chest , abdomen and pelvis , and a fine needle aspirate was obtained from suspicious inguinal lymph nodes for cytological examination .
no defunctioning stoma was formed unless deemed essential .
patients were advised to have a low - roughage diet during treatment .
for each patient , information was obtained on age , sex , tnm stage , histology , the date of diagnosis and the date of starting treatment , the chemotherapy used , the radiotherapy dose both external beam and boost , the use of defunctioning colostomy and the date of any salvage surgery .
the patients were followed 3 - monthly for 2 years and 4 - 6 - monthly until a minimum of 5 years of follow - up. local recurrence was assessed initially by digital examination and confirmed histologically and by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
patients with confirmed local recurrence were investigated further with a ct scan of chest , abdomen and pelvis .
anal function was assessed by common terminology criteria for adverse events ( ctcae ) version 4.0 .
early - stage disease was considered to be t1 n0 or t2 (< 3 cm in diameter ) n0 .
all other stages were considered to be locally advanced .
treatment patients with early - stage disease were considered for entry into the act ii trial [ 2 ] which recruited between june 2001 and december 2008 .
following the closure of this trial , standard treatment for early - stage disease was mitomycin / fluorouracil concurrently with external beam radiotherapy to a total dose of 50.4 gy in 28 daily fractions over 5.5 weeks .
patients with locally advanced disease were treated with mitomycin / fluorouracil according to the protocol of the act i trial [ 5 ] .
the radiotherapy was also prescribed according to this protocol .
the standard pelvic field was defined with superior border 2 cm above the inferior aspect of the sacroiliac joints , the inferior border 3 cm below the anal margin or 3 cm below the inferior extent of the anal tumour .
the lateral aspects were arranged to cover the inguinal nodes with no routine shielding of the femoral heads .
the mid line dose was 45 gy in 25 fractions ( 1.8 gy per fraction ) in 5 weeks with an anterior - posterior field arrangement .
a radiotherapy boost of 15 - 20 gy over 2 days was given with low dose rate [ 192 ] ir brachytherapy for anal canal tumours .
five needles were used covering the hemicircumference containing the tumour , sparing the other hemicircumference in order to preserve sphincter function .
a specially designed template was used in the majority of patients .
a radiotherapy boost of 20 gy in ten fractions in 2 weeks was given with high energy electrons to anal margin tumours .
statistical analysis overall survival , disease - specific survival and stoma - free survival were estimated using the kaplan - meier method with ibm spss statistics version 21 .
results a total of 92 patients were found on the database for the period 1 december 2000 to 30 april 2011 ( see table 1 ) .
follow - up was to 30 november 2014 .
at that date , 50 of the 92 patients were alive without recurrence ( median follow - up 7.2 years , range 3 - 14 years ) .
there was female predominance as expected with 60 females and 32 males .
the seven patients treated with palliative intent were so treated because of advanced age , medical comorbidities or extensive local or metastatic disease .
there were also eight patients not fit enough for chemotherapy who received radical external beam radiotherapy ( three of these had an iridium boost ) .
twenty - five patients received chemoradiotherapy with no boost .
this was a mixed group of patients including those entered into the act ii trial or treated by the act ii radiotherapy protocol , those refusing a boost often because of a prolonged acute radiation reaction and those too frail for further treatment .
there were therefore 52 patients receiving radical chemoradiotherapy with a boost ( 36 iridium : 16 electron ) .

one patient had a defunctioning stoma which was formed prior to treatment and not reversed .
the overall survival was 75 % ( 95 % ci 61 - 89 ) at 5 years ( fig. 2 ) .
the patient with local recurrence only had a salvage abdomino - perineal resection with a stoma but died of disease 15 months later. fig. 1 kaplan - meier plot showing disease - specific survival for the groups receiving radical chemoradiotherapy with either the iridium boost or electron boost .
the cumulative proportion surviving at 5 years ( 95 % ci ) was 0.91 ( 0.81 , 1.01 ) for the iridium group and 0.78 ( 0.56 , 1.00 ) for the group receiving the electron boost .
the log - rank test showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0.272 ) fig. 2 kaplan - meier plot showing overall survival for the groups receiving radical chemoradiotherapy with either the iridium boost or electron boost .
the cumulative proportion surviving at 5 years ( 95 % ci ) was 0.75 ( 0.61 , 0.89 ) for the iridium group and 0.68 ( 0.44 , 0.92 ) for the group receiving the electron boost .
the log - rank test showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0.375 ) radical chemoradiotherapy with electron boost the disease - specific survival for these 16 patients ( fig. 1 ) was 78 % ( 95 % ci 56 - 100 ) at 5 years with two local recurrences and one additional patient who developed metastatic disease .
only one patient had a stoma formed before chemoradiotherapy for a t4 tumour , and this was not reversed .
the overall survival was 68 % ( 95 % ci 44 - 92 ) at 5 years ( fig. 2 ) .
the two patients who developed local recurrence had salvage abdomino - perineal resection with a stoma but both died of metastatic disease .
it was not the intention of this retrospective study to compare the survival of patients with anal canal tumours with those with anal margin tumours , but the log - rank test showed no statistically significant difference between the electron boost group and the brachytherapy group as far as disease - specific survival ( p = 0.272 ) and overall survival ( p = 0.375 ) is concerned .
toxicity the toxicity from chemoradiotherapy for anal cancer is well documented from the large randomised controlled trials .
only 2 of the 52 patients receiving radical chemoradiotherapy with a boost developed prolonged grade 3 toxicity , and one of these was later found to be associated with local recurrence .
anal function and stoma formation two of the 52 patients treated with radical chemoradiotherapy and a boost had a stoma formed before treatment which was not reversed , and 3 patients had a stoma formed because of abdomino - perineal resection for local recurrence but died of disease .
there were therefore 47 patients without a stoma .
the stoma - free survival at 5 years was 97 % ( 95 % ci 91 - 103 ) ( fig. 3 ) for the 36 patients who received brachytherapy as a boost and 80 % ( 95 % , ci 60 - 100 ) for the 16 patients who received electron therapy as a boost .
these stomas were all cancer rather than treatment - related , and therefore , the cancer - related stoma rates were 3 % at 5 years for the brachytherapy group and 20 % at 5 years for the electron group .
the reasons for the defunctioning colostomy in the two patients who had a stoma formed prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy was in one , severe anal pain requiring inpatient care with poor control with analgesics and in the other a rectovaginal fistula. fig. 3 kaplan - meier plot showing stoma - free survival for the groups receiving radical chemoradiotherapy with either the iridium boost or electron boost .
the cumulative proportion surviving stoma - free at 5 years ( 95 % ci ) was 0.97 ( 0.91 , 1.03 ) for the iridium group and 0.80 ( 0.60 , 1.00 ) for the group receiving the electron boost .
the log - rank test showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0.119 ) there were five stomas formed in the mixed group of 25 patients who received chemoradiotherapy without boost .
one patient required a defunctioning colostomy prior to chemoradiotherapy because of severe anal pain and faecal incontinence .
one patient developed a rectovaginal fistula during chemoradiotherapy causing treatment to be interrupted .
one patient developed a sigmoid stricture after chemoradiotherapy requiring a hartmann 's procedure .
two patients received an abdominoperineal resection of rectum for local recurrence ( one with additional vulvectomy ) .
none of these patients wished to have a defunctioning stoma because of poor anal function .
all patients were asked about anal function in the follow - up clinic , and all were satisfied with their anal function .
no formal score such as the wexner incontinence score was used [ 6 ] .
discussion the main aims in the treatment of scc of the anus are to achieve a high rate of cure without a permanent stoma and adequate ( from the patients perspective ) anal function [ 7 ] .
we have shown that this is possible to achieve in an unselected population , but over 20 % of our patients seen from this defined population were not suitable for radical chemotherapy .
in order to achieve these goals , it is important that an initial defunctioning colostomy is not performed unless there is a fistula ( in particular a recto - vaginal fistula ) or distressing anal pain .
in addition , a high enough dose of radiotherapy is needed for advanced tumours ( large t2 , t3 and t4 ) to obtain a high rate of local control [ 8 , 9 ] .
a brachytherapy boost [ 10 , 11 ] to a hemicircumference of the anal canal achieves the higher dose without giving the full dose to the hemicircumference not implanted .
this is impossible to achieve by any other method including intensity modulated radiotherapy [ 12 - 16 ] which is not cost - effective [ 17 ] .
a major disadvantage of anal brachytherapy in general radiotherapy practise is that relatively few radiation oncologists are trained in this technique .
in this study , the number of patients treated was small compared to the six published randomised controlled trials [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 18 , 19 ] .
however , there were only three local recurrences after radical chemoradiotherapy with a brachytherapy or electron boost in 52 patients , showing that a high rate of local control can be obtained in patients resident in a defined population .
close collaboration between specialist colorectal cancer surgeons with an interest in anal cancer and oncologists with a specialist interest in anal cancer at multidisciplinary team meetings can result in the smallest achievable percentage of stomas created prior to treatment .
it is important that in addition to reporting permanent colostomy rates , cancer - related and treatment - related colostomy rates are also reported [ 20 - 24 ] .
a low rate of stoma formation occurred in this study especially in the brachytherapy group .
only 2 of 52 patients had a stoma formed prior to treatment because of anal pain or fistula , and these stomas were not reversed .
the three patients with local recurrence all had salvage abdomino - perineal excision of rectum performed , and all three had further recurrence .
in the unicancer accord 3 trial [ 9 ] , patients treated initially with definitive colostomy were not eligible for the study but a temporary colostomy was allowed for severe symptoms or fistula if a reversal of the colostomy was reasonably expected .
the 5 - year colostomy - free survival was 73.7 - 77.8 % in this trial .
all patients in this trial received a boost either with 192ir brachytherapy or electron beam therapy .
no information was given concerning reversal of the temporary colostomies .
the colostomy - free survival in this trial was higher than expected in the standard dose boost with no induction chemotherapy .
the patients were recruited between 1999 and 2005 .
in our retrospective study , the patients were treated between 2000 and 2011 .
it is possible that in our single - centre study , it was easier to limit the use of a stoma than in a multicentre randomised trial , and consequently , the cancer - related stoma rate at 5 years was 3 % for the brachytherapy group and 20 % for the electron group with no treatment - related stomas at 5 years .
the assessment of anal function however during the follow - up of patients is difficult for several reasons : the estimated prevalence of anal incontinence ( including double incontinence ) in the normal population ( excluding people in care homes ) over the age of 65 years is 5 - 10 % in men and 10 - 15 % in women [ 6 , 25 ] .
the major cause of damage to the anal canal and sphincter is probably caused by the anal cancer and may wholly or partly be permanent .
unless there is considerable fibrosis after treatment , it may be difficult to attribute poor anal function to the effect of treatment .
patients find discussing anal incontinence embarrassing and may play - down their symptoms .
in this study , all the patients without a stoma or local recurrence were satisfied with their anal function .
conclusions a low rate of stoma formation can be achieved in the treatment of anal cancer with chemoradiotherapy if the number of stomas prior to treatment is kept to a minimum and the treatment protocol used leads to a low rate of local recurrence .
the indication in our series for a stoma prior to chemoradiotherapy was either severe anal pain with or without faecal incontinence or a rectovaginal fistula .
in all other patients , a stoma prior to chemoradiotherapy was avoided .

the human leukocyte antigen b27 ( hla - b27 ) transgenic rat is a model of human inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis .
studies of chronic inflammation in other rat models have demonstrated activation of the kallikrein - kinin system as well as modulation by a plasma kallikrein inhibitor initiated before the onset of clinicopathologic changes or a deficiency in high - molecular - mass kininogen .
here we study the effects of monoclonal antibody c11c1 , an antibody against high - molecular - mass kininogen that inhibits the binding of high - molecular - mass kininogen to leukocytes and endothelial cells in the hla - b27 rat , which was administered after the onset of the inflammatory changes .
thrice - weekly intraperitoneal injections of monoclonal antibody c11c1 or isotype igg1 were given to male 23 - week - old rats for 16 days .
stool character as a measure of intestinal inflammation , and the rear limbs for clinical signs of arthritis ( tarsal joint swelling and erythema ) were scored daily .
the animals were killed and the histology sections were assigned a numerical score for colonic inflammation , synovitis , and cartilage damage .
administration of monoclonal c11c1 rapidly decreased the clinical scores of pre - existing inflammatory bowel disease ( p < 0.005 ) and arthritis ( p < 0.001 ) .
histological analyses confirmed significant reductions in colonic lesions ( p = 0.004 ) and synovitis ( p = 0.009 ) .
decreased concentrations of plasma prekallikrein and high - molecular - mass kininogen were found , providing evidence of activation of the kallikrein - kinin system .
the levels of these biomarkers were reversed by monoclonal antibody c11c1 , which may have therapeutic potential in human inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis .
introduction human leukocyte antigen b27 ( hla - b27 ) transgenic fisher rats are normal at birth but develop chronic inflammation of multiple organ systems as they age .
transgenic rats of this strain , overexpressing the human hla - b27 and beta2 - microglobulin proteins , develop lesions of the gastrointestinal system , the joints , the skin , and the gonads , which seem similar to the spondyloarthropathies in humans that have been associated with the hla - b27 and beta2 - microglobulin genes [ 1,2 ] .
the gastrointestinal inflammation is mostly limited to the mucosa and submucosa , exhibiting histological features similar to those present in inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) [ 1 - 4 ] .
chronic intestinal inflammation is the first to occur , with clinical signs of diarrhea apparent after 12 weeks of age .
about 4 weeks later , joint inflammation is seen , and these rats can also be used for a model of inflammatory arthritis [ 3 ] .
the plasma kallikrein - kinin system ( kks ) , which is initiated by factor xiia [ 5 ] or prolylcarboxypeptidase [ 6 ] after binding of high - molecular - mass kininogen ( hk ) and plasma prekallikrein ( pk ) to the surface of endothelial cells and leukocytes [ 7 ] , generates the enzyme kallikrein .
kallikrein in turn cleaves hk to yield the inflammatory mediators bradykinin ( bk ) and cleaved high - molecular - mass kininogen ( hka ) [ 8 ] .
kallikrein is chemotactic , aggregates neutrophils [ 9 ] , stimulates superoxide formation , and releases elastase from neutrophils [ 10 ] , all of which induce tissue injury .
bk stimulates vascular permeability and angiogenesis after binding to endothelial cells [ 11 ] and also mediates pain through the release of prostanoids [ 12 ] .
hka stimulates cytokine release from rat [ 13 ] and human monocytes [ 14 ] .
thus , activation of the kks is an inflammatory stimulus that might be operative in human disease , as represented in fig. 1. we have shown that kks activation mediates the acute and chronic phases of t cell - mediated arthritis induced by peptidoglycan - polysaccharide complexes from group a streptococci ( pg - aps ) in lewis rats [ 15 ] and is selectively activated in granulomatous enterocolitis in these susceptible rats , but not in resistant buffalo rats [ 16 ] .
we have discovered a genetic difference in kininogen structure between resistant buffalo and fischer f344 inbred rats and the susceptible lewis rat that results in accelerated cleavage of hk in the latter .
this mutation consists of a single nucleotide polymorphism coding for the amino acid alteration , s511n , in the hk gene of lewis ( n511 ) ( mutant ) versus buffalo and fischer ( s511 ) ( wild - type ) rats that results in an altered glycosylation state [ 17 ] and an increased rate of hk cleavage by plasma kallikrein with release of bk. we have shown that bk has a critical role in the pg - aps - mediated arthritis [ 18 ] .
we have also implicated bk receptors as having a role in a different model of ibd , indomethacin - induced colitis [ 19 ] .
most recently , we have shown that a monoclonal antibody ( mab ) , c11c1 , acting to prevent hk interaction with cells involved in inflammatory disorders , inhibited the development of acute and chronic arthritis in the pg - aps model [ 20 ] .
to demonstrate that this effect was not specific for a single model and to allow us to assess the possibility of treating established chronic inflammation , we examined an hla - b27 transgenic rat model of chronic inflammation of the intestine and peripheral joints .
administration of mab c11c1 ameliorated colitis and tarsal joint inflammation .
materials and methods hla - b27 transgenic male rats were purchased from taconic laboratories ( germantown , ny ) and housed one per cage in accordance with wyeth research facility standard operating procedures .
they received a standard regimen of food and water .
animals were thoroughly acclimated to the laboratory before the beginning of the study .
the study was approved by the wyeth research ( cambridge ) institutional animal care and use committee .
at 23 weeks of age , 10 male rats presenting the clinical signs of colitis ( diarrhea ) and arthritis ( erythematous and swollen hind paws ) were randomized into either an isotype control mab igg ( n = 5 ) or mab c11c1 ( n = 5 ) treatment group .
each rat was weighed daily and received an intraperitoneal injection of isotype igg1 ( 6 mg / kg ) or mab c11c1 ( 1.9 mg / kg ) three times per week for 16 days .
stool character observations for each animal on each day of study were assigned numerical scores of 3 for diarrhea , 2 for soft stool and 1 for normal stool .
the clinical signs of arthritis in the tarsal joints were monitored daily in all of the animals .
this assessment was performed visually with a scale for swelling ( 0 to 3 ) and for erythema ( 0 to 3 ) of the hindpaws ( normal paw = 0 , mild = 1 , moderate = 2 , severe = 3 ) .
the maximum possible score for arthritis per animal per paw per day was 6 ( total per animal = 12 for both hindpaws ) .
histological analyses at the end of the experiment , the animals were killed with 100 % carbon dioxide , and the distal 10 cm of colon of each rat was removed and opened .
four standardized samples of colon were immersed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin [ 21 ] .
samples from each rat were prepared for histological evaluation .
the formalin - fixed tissues were processed in a tissue tek vacuum infiltration processor , model 4617 ( miles , inc. , west haven , ct ) for paraffin embedding .
the samples were sectioned at 5 mum thickness and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) for histological evaluation .
histological lesions were assigned scores in accordance with a previously defined scoring scheme [ 21 - 24 ] .
in brief , the severity in the colonic sections was evaluated for ulcer size ( none = 0 , small = 1 , large = 2 ) , degree of inflammation ( none = 0 , mild = 1 , moderate = 2 , severe = 3 ) , depth of lesion ( none = 0 , submucosa = 1 , muscularis propria = 2 , involving serosa = 3 ) , and fibrosis ( none = 0 , mild = 1 , severe = 2 ) .
the total histological scores for the colon specimens ranged from 0 to 10 .
during necropsy , segments of the rear limbs ( with the tarsal joints ) were removed , fixed in 10 % buffered formalin , and examined as described previously [ 22 ] .
after decalcification , histological sections were obtained and stained with h & e or safranin o / fast green stain .
synovial tissue from tarsal joints was evaluated on the basis of synovial hyperplasia ( synovial cell proliferation : mild = 1 , moderate = 2 , villus formation = 3 ) , fibroplasia ( subsynovial fibrosis : minimal = 1 , one - third to one - half of areolar tissue replacement = 2 , whole thickness areolar tissue replacement = 3 ) , inflammatory cell infiltrates ( occasional = 0 , small numbers / around blood vessels = 1 , small focal collections = 2 , large foci = 3 ) , and pannus formation ( organizing inflammatory exudates within the joint space : nondetectable = 0 , detectable = 2 ) .
the total histological score for synovial inflammation ranged from 0 to 11 [ 25 ] .
articular cartilage was evaluated with mankin 's histological grading system [ 26 ] : cartilage organization changes ( normal = 0 , surface irregularity = 1 , pannus and surface irregularity = 2 , clefts to transitional zone = 3 , clefts to radial zone = 4 , clefts to calcified zone = 5 , complete disorganization = 6 ) , chondrocyte proliferation ( none = 0 , hypercellularity = 1 , cloning = 2 , hypocellularity = 3 ) , proteoglycan contents ( safranin o / fast green staining , normal = 0 , slight reduction = 1 , modest reduction = 2 , severe reduction = 3 , no dye noted = 4 ) , and tidemark integrity ( intact = 0 , crossed by blood vessels = 1 ) .
the total mankin score ranged from 0 to 14 .
histological h & e - stained sections taken from kidney , liver , and spleen from the mab c11c1 - treated group were evaluated for signs of systemic inflammation and / or toxicity .
blood collection blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture with a 19 - gauge , 3 / 4 - inch needle on a 10 ml polypropylene syringe ( bd medical systems , franklin lakes , nj ) .
the sample was obtained from the left atrium as the heart beat .
the sample of 3 to 5 ml was obtained by slow vacuum ( to prevent hemolysis ) within a minute ( to prevent clotting in the syringe ) .
the blood was then transferred into pre - marked , 1 ml eppendorf polypropylene tubes ( fisher scientific , pittsburgh , pa ) containing 100 mul of anticoagulant ( citrate - phosphate - dextrose solution with adenine , sigma c - 4431 ; sigma chemical co. ) to a final volume of 1 ml and gently mixed .
plasma was isolated by double centrifugation of the citrated blood in polypropylene tubes ( fisher scientific ) at 23degreesc .
aliquots were stored at - 70degreesc until assayed .
assays of kks activation ex vivo pk function levels were performed by a microtiter , amidolytic assay using a chromogenic substrate , s - 2302 ( pro - phe - arg - p - nitroanilide ; chromogenix , moindal , sweden ) , as described previously [ 27 ] .
hk coagulant activity was evaluated by our modification of an aptt test assay [ 28,29 ] , using total kininogen - deficient plasma purchased from george king ( overland park , ks ) [ 19 ] .
in addition , factor xi and factor xii coagulant activity assays were performed with a similar method using the appropriate deficient plasma obtained from george king .
statistical analyses all the evaluations were made by examiners blinded to the treatment groups .
all of the parameters were subjected to students' t test between groups .
data were expressed as means +/ - sem , and differences were deemed significant if p < 0.05 .
results twenty - four hours after the onset of therapy in the mab c11c1 - treated rats , the clinical signs of intestinal inflammation ( diarrhea ) had disappeared , and the stool character remained normal or nearly normal for the duration of the experiment ( fig. 2a ) .
histological analysis demonstrated significant reductions ( from 60 to 75 %) in lesion scores in the animals treated with mab c11c1 in comparison with animals injected with isotype igg1 ( fig. 2b,c ) .
daily visual inspection of the tarsal joints in the mab c11c1 - treated animals revealed marked reductions in the degree of swelling and erythema of the joints compared with isotype - treated animals .
as can be seen in fig. 3a , within 24 hours of the onset of therapy , the mean joint histological scores in the mab c11c1 - treated rats decreased by about 50 % compared with the mab control group. by the end of 1 week of treatment , the clinical signs of arthritis had almost disappeared .
evaluation of the histological features of the arthritis in the tarsal joints at the termination of the experiment on day 16 showed a marked reduction in the parameters of synovitis in the rats treated with mab c11c1 compared with those receiving isotype igg1 ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 3b,c ) .
in a similar manner to the changes seen in the colon , 40 to 60 % decreases in the various components of the synovitis score occurred .
however , the effects on the articular cartilage were more modest .
nevertheless , the cartilage organization , chondrocyte proliferation and total mankin score were significantly decreased ( fig. 3d ) .
tidemark integrity was preserved in all groups ( data not shown ) .
histological analysis of kidney , liver and spleen sections showed normal architecture without any signs of inflammation or toxicity in both treated groups ( results not shown ) .
kks activation assays to assess kks system activation in this animal model of inflammation , we compared the experimental groups' results with a standard pool of normal fischer 344 rat plasma ( fig. 4 ) .
we measured the plasma functional levels of four contact proteins .
at the termination of the experiment ( day 16 ) , hk levels were reduced in both groups compared with the standard pool level .
the values in the mab c11c1 - treated animals were closer to normal than those in the isotype - treated animals .
hk levels were significantly lower in the isotype igg - treated group ( 74.7 +/ - 1.0 ) than in the group receiving mab c11c1 ( 83.9 +/ - 1.1 ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
pk levels were significantly decreased in the igg isotype group ( 52.5 +/ - 1.3 %) versus the mab c11c1 - treated group ( 60.1 +/ - 1.3 % ; p < 0.005 ) .
factor xi was similarly lower in both experimental groups but factor xii was not lower ( in any group ) .
neither difference in factor xi or factor xii levels between the two experimental groups was significant .
the results of these assays were similar to those observed in our previous studies [ 20 ] , in which a decrease in hk and pk was the most consistent evidence for kks activation .
discussion therapy with c11c1 , a mab that interferes with the cellular binding of hk , evoked marked anti - inflammatory activity in both the colon and the tarsal joints of hla - b27 transgenic rats .
the onset of anti - inflammatory activity by mab c11c1 was rapid and sustained throughout the study , with the first effect seen in the intestine .
the joint changes began to resolve with improvement in stool character , but it took almost 10 days for the joint swelling and erythema to reach minimal levels ( as reflected in joint score values ) .
the histological effects in the colon seemed to be more complete than those seen in the tarsal joints because only a modest effect was seen on the articular cartilage lesions , as reflected in the mankin score .
however , if one compares the colonic score results with the synovitis score results , the effect was very similar in both character and magnitude .
the isotype igg1 group kks assays showed a decrease in hk and pk levels consistent with this system activation , whereas the mab c11c1 - treated group showed significantly increased levels of both proteins .
these observations are explained by the fact that mab c11c1 inhibits the activation of hk , thus blocking kks activation and decreasing the signs of inflammation [ 20 ] .
the hla - b27 transgenic rat model has been used for several years to evaluate the activity and mechanisms of actions of anti - inflammatory molecules [ 22,23,30 - 34 ] .
this model is very reproducible and consistent , as long as the environmental conditions remain stable .
the chronic inflammation seen in these transgenic rats seems to be the result of hla - b27 transgene expression - induced alterations in antigen processing and subsequent immune responses to the microbial environment in the lumen of the animal 's gastrointestinal tract [ 35,36 ] .
these aberrant responses lead to cd4 + t cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine production .
broad - spectrum antibiotic therapy can produce significant remissions of the inflammatory lesions , but relapse occurs when antibiotic therapy stops [ 35 ] .
if antibiotic therapy is followed by inoculation of the gut with probiotic agents such as lactobacillus rhamnosus , relapse is prevented [ 36 ] .
lactobacilli have also been shown to be effective in treating patients with chronic pouchitis after ileal pouch - anal anastomosis for the treatment of ulcerative colitis [ 37 ] .
in addition to antibiotics and probiotic agents , other standard anti - inflammatory agents used in the long - term treatment of ibd patients are also active in the hla - b27 transgenic rat .
both dexamethasone and prednisolone produce dose - dependent reductions in the inflammation in these animals [ 38,39 ] .
as in patients with ibd , sulfasalazine at low doses is without effect in the hla - b27 transgenic rat [ 40 ] , but high doses do ameliorate the disease [ 41 ] .
three approaches have been used in our laboratory to show that the kks has a major role in inflammatory arthritis and enterocolitis with the use of the pg - aps models .
first , we used a specific oral reversible tight - binding active - site inhibitor of plasma kallikrein , d - pro - phe - boro - arg .
this specific kallikrein inhibitor attenuated acute inflammatory changes ( edema , and neutrophil infiltration ) and prevented arthritis and chronic systemic complications ( splenomegaly , hepatomegaly , leukocytosis and the acute - phase reaction ) in the pg - aps model [ 42 ] .
the same plasma kallikrein inhibition modulated acute intestinal changes [ 28 ] as well as chronic granulomatous intestinal inflammation [ 29 ] similar to human crohn 's disease .
second , we showed that antagonists of bk receptor type 2 ameloriate acute arthritis [ 43 ] whereas an antagonist of bk receptor type 1 aggravated the joint inflammation [ 44 ] .
we have recently shown that bk receptor antagonists can upregulate or downregulate specific cell - adhesion molecules [ 44 ] .
third , kininogen deficiency was first described in brown norway rats [ 45 ] .
we introduced this mutation into a lewis genetic background with five generations of backcrosses and showed that the deficiency of kininogen ameliorated acute and chronic enterocolitis [ 46 ] .
because we have previously successfully used the mab c11c1 to inhibit tumor growth in a syngeneic murine model ( sainz im , isordia - salas i , pixley ra , colman rw , unpublished work ) and in a human colon carcinoma grown in a nude ( immunodeficient ) mouse model [ 47 ] , we used this fourth approach in the present study .
this antibody has recently been successfully employed in the pg - aps model in which mab c11c1 inhibited inflammatory changes in joints , systemic inflammation , and activation of the kallikrein - kinin system [ 20 ] .
here we have demonstrated its efficiency in treating hla - b27 - associated inflammatory disease .
each of the previous approaches to inhibiting the kks to control inflammation was successful but had certain limitations .
the plasma kallikrein active - site inhibitor displayed hepatic toxicity .
the bk receptor antagonist had only a modest effect .
kininogen deficiency is rare in humans and is not really an applicable therapeutic modality .
however , we were encouraged by the success of mab c11c1 in the pg - aps model in the prevention of systemic and joint inflammation [ 20 ] and the lack of obvious side effects .
the fact that antibodies against other inflammatory agonists have been used in the treatment of human ibd , arthritis and cancer make its use attractive .
until this study , mab c11c1 had been used in a preventive mode .
the hla - b27 transgenic rat model permitted the rapid treatment of an established disease model .
on the basis of these results , we suggest that mab c11c1 might be a candidate for a therapeutic agent in human inflammatory disease .
conclusion we have assessed a transgenic rat model in which the human gene encoding hla - b27 has been overexpressed .
these rats developed t cell - mediated , spontaneous arthritis resembling reactive or inflammatory arthritis .
we were able to successfully treat an established disease with an antibody against kininogen without inducing side effects or toxicity in either the rat or the mouse model of the disease .

2004 - 02 - 0449 figures and tables figure 1 kallikrein - kinin system ( kks ) .
the kks is initiated by factor xiia ( fxiia ) or prolylcarboxypeptidase on the endothelial cell and leukocyte ( polymorphonuclear cell ( pmn )) surface , generating the enzyme kallikrein , which in turn cleaves high - molecular - mass kininogen ( hk ) to yield bradykinin ( bk ) and cleaved high - molecular - mass kininogen ( hka ) .
kallikrein is chemotactic , aggregates neutrophils , and stimulates the release of elastase and superoxide ( potent inducers of tissue injury ) .
bk stimulates vasodilation , mediates pain through the release of prostaglandins , and stimulates vascular permeability through the generation of nitrous oxide ( no ) .
pk , prekallikrein .
figure 2 effect of mab c11c1 on hla - b27 transgenic rats colonic inflammation .
( a ) effects of monoclonal antibody ( mab ) c11c1 on diarrhea in human leukocyte antigen b27 ( hla - b27 ) rats .
stool score was determined five times a week ( normal stool = 1 , soft stool = 2 , watery stool = 3 ) .
mab c11c1 ( 1.9 mg / kg ) was administered three times a week for 16 days .
the control group received murine isotype igg1 ( 6 mg / kg ) three times a week for 16 days .
all stool scores are significantly different between the two groups for each corresponding day ( p < 0.005 ) except for day 11 ( p = 0.03 ) .
data are shown as means +/ - sem .

( c ) effects of mab c11c1 on synovial inflammatory changes in hla - b27 rats .
treatment with mab c11c1 ( open bars ) decreased synovial proliferation ( hyperplasia ) ( p = 0.01 ) , subsynovial fibrosis ( fibroplasia ) ( p = 0.001 ) , and degree of inflammation ( p < 0.001 ) , but not pannus formation .
the total score of the control igg1 of 9.6 +/ - 1.0 was reduced by mab c11c1 to an inflammatory score of 5.0 +/ - 1.0 ( p = 0.009 ) .
data are shown as means +/ - sem .
* p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 ; *** p < 0.005 .
( d ) effects of mab c11c1 on cartilage and bone inflammatory changes in hla - b27 rats .
mab c11c1 ( open bars ) significantly improved ( decreased the mankin score of ) the cartilage organization ( p = 0.01 ) and the altered chondrocyte proliferation ( p = 0.008 ) .
the proteoglycan cartilage contents ( safranin o / fast green staining ) were similar in both experimental groups ( p > 0.05 ) and the tidemark integrity was preserved ( data not shown ) .
the total mankin score was significantly decreased in the mab c11c1 - treated group ( p = 0.02 ) .
data are shown as means +/ - sem .

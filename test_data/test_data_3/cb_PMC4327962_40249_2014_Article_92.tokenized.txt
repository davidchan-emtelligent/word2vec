background rabies is one of the oldest known and most feared human diseases .
epidemiological studies provide basic information about the burden of the disease and underline the importance of prevention and control interventions .
however , there have been limited studies conducted regarding the incidence of rabies and associated factors in ethiopia , in general , and in this study area , in particular .
therefore , the aim of this study was to assess the incidence of human rabies exposure and associated factors at the gondar health center , ethiopia .
methods a retrospective cross - sectional study was conducted at the gondar health center where post - exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) for rabies was available for the whole population in the north gondar zone catchment area .
data of human rabies exposure cases between 2011 and 2013 were collected from the rabies pep registration book using data abstraction sheets .
the data was entered and analyzed using spss version 16 statistical software .
result a total of 261 cases of human rabies exposure were reported to the gondar health center from 2011 to 2013 .
the sex and age specific distribution showed that the majority of these cases were among males ( 142 / 226 , 62.8 %) and children under 15 years of age ( 87 / 226 , 38.5 %) .
a predominant number of cases were observed in individuals from rural areas ( 161 / 220 , 73.2 %) , and during fall and winter seasons ( 67 / 222 , 30.18 %) .
a significant number of people exposed to rabies ( 23.2 %) came to the health center for pep two or more weeks after the injury .
the incidence of human rabies exposure cases was 4.6 , 2.61 , and 1.27 per 100 , 000 population in 2011 , 2012 , and 2013 , respectively .
being male and living in an urban setting were found to be risk factors for human rabies exposure in 2011 .
conclusion a significant number of human rabies exposure cases were reported to the gondar health center .
being male and living in an urban setting were found to be associated with rabies exposure .
a community - based follow - up study is recommended to more accurately estimate the incidence of human rabies exposure .

background rabies is a very dangerous viral zoonosis , and all mammals can be infected by the virus .
the cause of rabies is a neurotropic virus belonging to the class mononegavirales , the family rhabdoviridae , and the genus lyssa virus [ 1 ] .
this disease is endemic in tropical areas and more cases are observed in developing countries [ 2 ] .
almost 99.9 % of mortalities caused by human rabies as well as 98.5 % of animal bite cases occur in tropical areas [ 3 ] .
according to a world health organization ( who ) report , worldwide human deaths from endemic canine rabies are estimated to be 55,000 per annum [ 4 ] .
domestic dogs are most important sources of infection with more than 94 % of human cases occurring due to a bite from a rabid dog [ 5 ] .
rabies has the highest case fatality rate of any conventional infectious disease , approaching the 100 % mark .
the likelihood of a productive rabies infection after exposure to the virus depends on the dose , route of exposure , site of exposure , variant , host genetic makeup , pre - and / or post - exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) , etc .
[ 6 ] .
all mammals are susceptible to the lyssa virus infection , but species - level variation in susceptibility has long been recognized [ 7 ] .
in africa , rabies constitutes a serious public health problem [ 8 - 10 ] .
in ethiopia , it is an important disease that has been around for many centuries .
recommended treatments for people bitten by rabid animals , mainly dogs , have been recorded in many ethiopian medical books since the early 17th century [ 11 ] .
rabies fulfills the who criteria required to target a certain disease for control [ 12 ] .
unlike many other emerging zoonosis , safe and effective animal and human vaccines are widely available for its prevention and control .
despite this , rabies remains a neglected disease that is poorly controlled throughout much of the developing world , particularly in africa and asia , where most deaths from human rabies occur [ 12 , 13 ] .
epidemiological studies provide basic information about the burden of the disease and underline the importance of prevention and control interventions .
therefore , this study was aimed to assess the incidence of human rabies exposure cases and associated factors at the gondar health center in ethiopia .
methods the study was conducted at the gondar health center , gondar , ethiopia ( see figure 1 ) .
the city of gondar is located in the north gondar zone of the amhara region and is 748 kilometers from the capital , addis ababa .
the town has a latitude and longitude of 12degrees36'n 37degrees28'e , with an elevation of 2,133 meters above sea level .
the gondar health center is the only health center in the north gondar zone where post - exposure prophylaxis ( ppe ) for rabies is given .
figure 1 map of the study area .
a retrospective cross - sectional study was conducted to assess the incidence of human rabies exposure and associated risk factors from 2011 to 2013 .
all people who were exposed to rabies and visited the gondar health center for pep between 2011 and 2013 made up the study population .
age , sex , season of exposure , residence , and whether the dog survived were the independent variables of the study , while human rabies exposure was treated as an outcome variable .
data of human rabies exposure cases between 2011 and 2013 were collected from the rabies pep registration book using data abstraction sheets .
the data was entered and analyzed using spss version 16 statistical software .
a descriptive analysis was performed for categorical variables .
bivariate analysis was performed to examine possible risk factors of human rabies exposure .
in all cases , p - values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
ethical approval was obtained from the school of biomedical and laboratory sciences research and ethical review committee , college of medicine and health sciences , university of gondar .
moreover , an official letter was sent to the gondar health center to ensure the study was conducted smoothly .
results a total of 261 human rabies exposure cases were reported to the gondar health center from 2011 to 2013 .
it was observed that the distribution of human rabies exposure cases year to year decreased : 140 , 81 , and 40 human rabies exposure cases were reported in 2011 , 2012 , and 2013 , respectively .
the sex specific distribution showed that the majority of rabies exposure cases were among males ( 142 / 226 , 62.8 %) .
similarly , children under 15 years of age were the most affected ( 84 / 226 , 38.5 %) .
this study showed that more rabies exposure cases ( 161 / 220 , 73.2 %) were observed in people from rural areas .
in contrast , human rabies exposure in people from urban areas was low ( 59 / 220 , 26.8 %) .
a significant number of rabies exposure cases were reported during fall and winter ( 67 / 222 , 30.18 %) .
in contrast , a lower proportion of rabies exposure cases was reported during spring and summer ( 44 / 222 , 19.8 %) ( see table 1 ) .

most of the people exposed to rabies visited the center within a week , or between one and two weeks after exposure .
however , a significant number of people ( 24.7 %) exposed to rabies came to the health center for pep two or more weeks after the injury ( see table 2 ) .
all human rabies exposure cases were due to a bite from a dog .
the majority of the dogs died by the time of the visit to the health center ( 71.65 %) and the survival statuses of the rest were unknown ( see figure 2 ) .

the incidence of human rabies exposure cases as it was calculated from the mid - year population was 4.6 , 2.61 , and 1.27 per 100,000 population for the three respective study years .
in all three years in which the study took place , males were more exposed to rabies ( see table 3 ) .
being male and living in an urban setting ( see table 4 ) were found to be risk factors for human rabies exposure from bivariate analysis [ cor = 1.5967 ( 95 % ci = 1.1347 - 2.2467 ) and cor = 2.6328 ( 95 % ci = 1.8092 - 3.8311 )] , respectively , for the year 2011 .

discussion a significant number of human rabies exposure cases ( 261 ) were reported to the gondar health center from 2011 to 2013 .
the sex specific distribution showed that the majority ( 62.8 %) of the rabies cases were among males .
this finding was supported by a previous ethiopian study and a nigerian study [ 14 , 15 ] .
this might be explained by the activities males are frequently involved in : they might do more nightly and outdoor activities while females are more likely to remain indoors due to cultural and religious reasons .
a large proportion human rabies exposure cases were reported among children under 15 years of age ( 38.5 %) .
this finding is in line with studies done in tanzania and ethiopia [ 14 , 16 ] .
this could potentially be explained by the fact that children are more likely to provoke dogs and are also less likely to be able to defend themselves , thereby being more exposed to dog bite injuries .
unlike the present study , a study conducted in new york reported no significant differences among sex or age distributions and rabies exposure [ 17 ] .
this study showed that the majority of the rabies exposure cases ( 161 / 220 , 73.2 %) were observed in people from rural areas , which is concurrent with the study done in new york [ 17 ] .
this might possibly be explained by the fact that larger populations reside in rural areas in ethiopia compared to urban settings .
the majority of rabies exposure cases were reported to occur during fall and winter ( 67 / 222 , 30.18 %) .
contrary to this finding , studies from new york , tanzania , and nigeria reported high incidence of rabies exposure during spring and summer [ 15 - 17 ] .
this seasonal variation could be due to variations in geographical locations which determine the weather conditions of each season .
a significant number of people exposed to rabies ( 24.7 %) came to the health center for pep late , which would hamper the efficacy of the pep .
unlike our finding , a nigerian retrospective study revealed that most ( 87.7 %) of the victims afflicted with dog bite injuries presented at a clinic within 24 hours of the bite occurring , which is commendable [ 15 ] .
the explanation for our study 's finding might be due to the health center 's inaccessibility in terms of distance for the majority of the rural catchment area , as the gondar health centre is the only facility providing pep .
dog bite was the only source of rabies exposure in this study .
this finding is consistent with another community - based active surveillance study conducted in kenya [ 18 ] .
among dogs responsible for rabies exposure , the majority ( 71.65 %) died at the time of the victim 's visit to the health center and the survival statuses of the rest were unknown .
this implies that dogs were the potential sources of the rabies infection .
the incidence of human rabies exposure cases as it was calculated from the mid - year population was 4.6 , 2.61 , and 1.27 per 100,000 population for the three respective study years .
this finding is by far lower than reports from studies in new york ( 27 / 100,000 ) , tanzania ( 58 / 100,000 ) , and a kenyan active surveillance report ( 234 / 100,000 ) [ 16 - 18 ] .
these discrepancies might be explained by multiple socio - cultural factors and methodological differences .
although we did n't exhaustively assess all possible risk factors for human rabies exposure due to the limited data available in the log book , being male was found to be a risk factor for human rabies exposure for the year 2011.this was supported by studies from tanzania , ethiopia , and nigeria [ 14 - 16 ] .
the present study also found that living in an urban setting is a risk factor , unlike the report from new york .
this might be due to the fact that in ethiopia people in rural settings settle very far apart in contrary to urban areas where people live in crowded conditions , which may favor dog bite exposure .
as well as that , stray dogs are abundant in urban settings which may contribute to human rabies exposure .
conclusion a significant number of cases of human rabies exposure was reported to the gondar health centre despite the fact that the majority of victims would have preferred traditional healers for post - exposure management of rabies ( which may have reduced the actual figure ) .
dog bite was the only source of exposure reported .
a significant number of people exposed to rabies came to the health center to seek medical attention late .
being male and living in an urban setting were found to be the risk factors for rabies exposure in 2011 .
a community - based follow - up study is recommended to more accurately estimate the incidence of human rabies exposure .

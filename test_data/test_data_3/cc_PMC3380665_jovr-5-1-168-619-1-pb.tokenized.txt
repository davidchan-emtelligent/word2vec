purpose to report the long - term results of intravitreal bevacizumab ( avastin ) therapy for choroidal neovascularization ( cnv ) secondary to non - age - related macular degeneration ( non - amd ) .
methods this prospective interventional case series was conducted on patients with non - amd cnv .
all patients received 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab and were followed for at least 18 weeks .
indications for retreatment were decreased visual acuity or recurrence of subretinal fluid or hemorrhage associated with leakage on fluorescein angiography .
primary outcome measures were changes in best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) and central macular thickness ( cmt ) .
secondary outcome measures consisted of any adverse event related to the therapy .
results the study included 31 eyes of 28 patients with non - amd cnv including idiopathic ( n = 11 ) , due to myopia ( n = 7 ) , angioid streaks ( n = 5 ) , and other disorders ( n = 8 ) .
mean initial bcva was 20 / 100 which improved to 20 / 60 at 6 weeks ; 20 / 40 at 12 , 18 , 24 , and 36 weeks ; and 20 / 30 at 54 weeks .
serial optical coherence tomography measurements showed mean cmt of 288 mum at baseline , which was decreased to 209 mum at last visit ( p = 0.95 ) .
there was no correlation between the underlying disease and changes in bcva during the follow - up period .
conclusion intravitreal bevacizumab significantly improved visual acuity in eyes with non - amd cnv due to various etiologies .
bevacizumab choroidal neovascularization non - age - related macular degeneration introduction choroidal neovascularization ( cnv ) may develop in the course of over 30 different ocular disorders.1,2 the most common cause of cnv apart from age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) is pathologic myopia.3 in patients aged 50 years or younger , cnv may develop in the absence of any identifiable cause and is considered to be idiopathic.3,4 other less common causes of cnv include angioid streaks , central serous chorioretinopathy ( csc ) , ocular histoplasmosis syndrome ( ohs ) , multifocal choroiditis , trauma , and hereditary eye diseases.3,5,6 a number of studies have demonstrated that the vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , a potent mitogen for endothelial cells , plays a principal role in the development of neovascularization in various chorioretinal diseases.7,8 there have been recent reports on the use of intravitreal bevacizumab ( ivb ) , a pan anti - vegf antibody , for cnv secondary to high myopia,9 - 20 angioid streaks,21,22 csc,23 idiopathic,23,24 ohs,25,26 and choroidal osteoma.27 however , limited information is available on the long - term effect of treatment with vegf - blocking agents on cnv secondary to non - amd causes .
herein we present the long - term outcomes of ivb therapy on non - amd cnv due to various etiologies .
methods this prospective interventional case series includes consecutive patients with non - amd cnv who were recruited from the department of ophthalmology at labbafinejad medical center , a tertiary referral eye care center in tehran .
inclusion criteria were : clinical setting suggesting cnv of non - amd origin , subfoveal or juxtafoveal location of the lesion and evidence of leakage on fluorescein angiography ( fa ) .
exclusion criteria consisted of clinical features suggesting cnv secondary to amd , diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma .
however , patients who had previously received thermal laser therapy or photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) for cnv were not excluded .
the ethics committee of the ophthalmic research center approved the study protocol , and informed consent regarding the risks , benefits , and alternatives of therapy was obtained from all patients .
at baseline , all patients underwent a comprehensive examination , including determination of best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) , slitlamp biomicroscopy , intraocular pressure ( iop ) measurement , dilated fundus examination , color fundus photography , fluorescein angiography ( fa ) and optical coherence tomography ( oct ) .
bcva was evaluated by certified optometrists using a snellen chart at 6m with conversion to logmar equivalent for statistical analysis .
oct was performed by a technician using the three dimensional oct - 1000 ( topcon , europe medical b.v. , capelle a / d ijssel , the netherlands ) , and central macular thickness ( cmt ) was measured using the retinal thickness map .
the decision for ivb injection was made according to presence of active cnv judged by the presence of leakage on fa , and intra - or subretinal fluid on oct .
intravitreal bevacizumab injection was performed as an outpatient procedure under aseptic conditions in the operating room .
topical anesthesia was achieved using 0.5 % tetracaine drops , and 5 % povidone - iodine solution was applied to the eyelids and the cul - de - sac , followed by draping and insertion of a lid speculum .
intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg / 0.05 ml bevacizumab ( avastin , roche , basel , switzerland ) was performed using a 30 - gauge needle 4 - mm posterior to the limbus in the superior temporal quadrant .
topical ciprofloxacin ( 4 times a day ) was prescribed for 3 days after the injection .
patients were examined the day after the procedure and after 1 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , and 54 weeks .
at each visit bcva , a complete ocular examination and oct were repeated ; fundus photography and fa were performed as necessary .
after initial treatment , the decision to retreat was based on clinical , oct and angiographic findings .
subsequent injections were administered at least 6 weeks after a previous injection if the patients complained of decreased vision and / or increased metamorphopsia , or in cases which recurrence of intra - or subretinal fluid , or hemorrhage was associated with leakage on fa. primary outcome measures were changes in bcva and cmt based on oct .
secondary outcome measures were any ocular or systemic adverse events during the study period .
statistical analysis was performed using spss version 15.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , usa ) .
serial changes in bcva and oct were compared using paired t - test .
analysis of variance ( anova ) was employed to compare changes in bcva and the number of injections in relation to the underlying disease .
p values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant .
results thirty - one phakic eyes of 28 patients including 10 male and 18 female subjects with mean age of 37.8 +/ - 12.1 ( range , 11 - 67 ) years were enrolled .
patients' characteristics are shown in table 1 .
underlying diagnoses associated with non - amd cnv were idiopathic in 11 eyes , myopia in 7 eyes , angioid streaks in 5 eyes , and other causes in 8 eyes ( ocular toxoplasmosis in 3 eyes , multifocal choroiditis in 2 eyes ; and ohs , csc and choroidal osteoma , each in 1 eye ) .
nine eyes had received 1 to 3 sessions of pdt 3 to 6 months prior to ivb injection , and one eye had 2 sessions of thermal laser therapy previously .
ivb was used as primary treatment in the remaining 21 eyes .
mean follow - up period was 40.4 +/ - 12 ( range , 18 - 54 ) weeks .
visual results are shown in table 2 and outcomes within each subgroup are detailed in table 3 .
figure 1 shows changes in mean bcva during the study period .
mean bcva at baseline was 0.69 +/ - 0.51 logmar ( 20 / 100 ) which improved to 0.44 +/ - 0.39 logmar ( 20 / 60 , p = 0.001 ) 6 weeks after initial ivb injection and remained stable at 12 weeks ( 0.34 +/ - 0.39 logmar , 20 / 40 , p < 0.001 ) , 18 weeks ( 0.33 +/ - 0.37 logmar , 20 / 40 , p < 0.001 ) , 24 weeks ( 0.29 +/ - 0.37 logmar , 20 / 40 , p < 0.001 ) , 36 weeks ( 0.28 +/ - 0.32 , 20 / 40 , p = 0.001 ) , and final follow - up ( 0.23 +/ - 0.26 logmar , 20 / 30 , p = 0.029 ) .
only one eye experienced bcva deterioration >= 2 line from baseline at last follow - up. at week 54 , 60 % of eyes demonstrated visual improvement >= 2 lines , and pre - treatment bcva was preserved in the remaining 40 % ( table 2 ) .
changes in bcva during the study period showed no significant relationship with the underlying condition ( p = 0.14 and p = 0.15 at 36 and 54 weeks , respectively ) .
the mean number of intravitreal injections was 2.16 which also showed no correlation with the underlying disorder ( p = 0.19 ) .
figure 2 shows serial changes in mean cmt during the study period .
mean cmt was 288 mum at baseline , decreased to 240 mum after 6 weeks , and was further reduced to 209 mum after 54 weeks .
however , changes in cmt were not statistically significant ( p = 0.95 ) .
representative examples demonstrate the effect of ivb for treatment of cnv secondary to ocular toxoplasmosis ( fig. 3 ) , csc ( fig. 4 ) , and angioid streaks ( fig. 5 ) , and also for idiopathic cnv ( fig. 6 ) .
none of the patients developed systemic ( thromboembolic events or cerebral vascular accidents ) , or ocular ( intraocular inflammation , iop rise , cataract formation , endophthalmitis and retinal detachment ) complications related to ivb injection .
discussion in this prospective study , eyes treated with ivb for non - amd cnv showed significant visual improvement which was maintained for about one year .
the current work may support the notion that vegf is a critical stimulus for cnv formation in different clinical settings such as myopia , angioid streaks , toxoplasmosis , multifocal choroiditis , choroidal osteoma and ocular histoplasmosis .
based on data from the last follow - up , bcva improved >= 2 lines in 60 % of ivb treated eyes .
these functional results are in agreement with a previous case series of ivb for non - amd cnv , including idiopathic cnv ( improvement in 50 % of cases at 3 months24 and 73 % of eyes at 6 months23 ) , and cnv secondary to csc and punctate inner choroidopathy ( improvement in 73 % of eyes at 6 months ) 23 where similar criteria for visual improvement were applied .
visual results in our patients compare favorably with the natural history and with outcomes of previous treatment modalities for non - amd cnv .
previous studies have shown with observation alone and with pdt , 42 % 4 and 58 % 28 of eyes with idiopathic cnv demonstrate >= 2 lines of visual acuity improvement .
in contrast , in the present study , 75 % of eyes in the subgroup with idiopathic cnv showed >= 2 lines of improvement following ivb injections .
patients with cnv secondary to pathologic myopia have a poor natural course ; 29 in a randomized trial , eyes treated with pdt did not fare better than untreated controls.30 the effectiveness of ivb for myopic cnv has been evaluated in multiple case series.9 - 20 in a prospective , noncomparative interventional cases series , ruiz - moreno et al17 reported the one year results of ivb for treatment of subfoveal cnv in highly myopic eyes .
twenty - nine eyes underwent 3 monthly injections of 1.25 mg ivb and were evaluated in terms of bcva and oct at baseline and then monthly for one year .
fa was performed at baseline , after 3 months and whenever cnv activity was suspected ; this was similar to our treatment and follow - up protocol. of 29 eyes , 16 were naive for treatment but 13 eyes had been previously treated with multiple sessions of pdt .
six eyes required repeat injections .
mean bcva at baseline was 0.55 logmar which improved to 0.38 logmar at 1 year ; cmt decreased significantly at month 12 as compared to baseline .
the one year results of ivb injections ( 2.5 mg ) for myopic cnv were also evaluated in a recent study on eyes without earlier treatment.20 significant visual improvement and cmt reduction was observed in this series with a mean number of 1.4 injections within 12 months .
the mean number of injections was 2 in our study with greater follow - up as compared to previous studies .
two other recent studies on ivb for myopic cnv have also demonstrated comparable results at one year.18,19 the visual prognosis of cnv secondary to angioid streaks is dismal ; a group of untreated patients lost 6 lines of visual acuity in 18 months.31 the results of treatment for cnv secondary to angioid streaks are poor with thermal laser and disappointing with pdt .
the visual results after pdt vary widely ; however , all studies show loss of va , including 1 - line loss at 1 - year,32 4.9 - line loss at 18 months33 and 3 - line loss at 42 months.34 therefore it might be inferred that pdt is not a good treatment modality for cnv secondary to angioid streaks.31,32,34 in contrast , ivb may lead to modest improvement or stabilization in vision and lesion size in such eyes.22,33,35,36 in the present study , none of the patients with angioid streaks lost va until final follow - up ; 20 % demonstrated visual improvement >= 2 lines , and 80 % maintained their pre - injection va. schadlu et al25 reported the results of ivb in eyes with cnv resulting from ohs. of 28 eyes , 20 ( 71 %) experienced visual improvement , va remained unchanged in 4 ( 14 %) eyes , and 4 eyes experienced a decrease in vision .
mean follow - up was 22 weeks with an average of 1.8 intravitreal injections .
adan et al26 also reported a case of presumed ocular histoplasmosis which responded remarkably well to ivb .
we had only one case of cnv secondary to presumed ocular histoplasmosis in our series .
marked visual improvement and resolution of metamorphopsia was noted in this patient after ivb injection .
the result of ivb in eyes with cnv secondary to multifocal choroiditis in our series were comparable to the report by fine et al37 who noted improved vision in 5 of 6 eyes .
deterioration of va occurred in one patient due to subfovel rip of the rpe .
we have reported the results of treatment of cnv secondary to choroidal osteoma elsewhere.27 in our study , changes in va and the number of injections were not correlated with the underlying conditions which is consistent with the report by chang et al.38 in summary , the results of this prospective study suggest that anatomical and visual outcomes of ivb treatment for non - amd cnv are favorable .
limitations of the study include the small number of cases and lack of a control group .
however , the low prevalence of certain underlying conditions may prevent performing large , randomized , controlled trials similar to those conducted for cnv secondary to amd .
in addition , it would unethical to withhold treatment from patients with non - amd cnv when the natural course of the condition is poor .

background the aims were to investigate the prevalence of perceived sleep quality and insufficient sleep complaints , and to analyze whether self - reported bruxism was associated with perceptions of sleep , and awake consequences of disturbed sleep , while controlling confounding factors relative to poor sleep .
methods a standardized questionnaire was mailed to all employees of the finnish broadcasting company with irregular shift work ( n = 750 ) and to an equal number of randomly selected controls in the same company with regular eight - hour daytime work .
results the response rate in the irregular shift work group was 82.3 % ( 56.6 % men ) and in the regular daytime work group 34.3 % ( 46.7 % men ) .
self - reported bruxism occurred frequently ( often or continually ) in 10.6 % of all subjects .
altogether 16.8 % reported difficulties initiating sleep ( dis ) , 43.6 % disrupted sleep ( ds ) , and 10.3 % early morning awakenings ( ema ) .
the corresponding figures for non - restorative sleep ( nrs ) , tiredness , and sleep deprivation ( sld ) were 36.2 % , 26.1 % , and 23.7 % , respectively .
according to logistic regression , female gender was a significant independent factor for all insomnia symptoms , and older age for ds and ema .
frequent bruxism was significantly associated with dis ( p = 0.019 ) and ds ( p = 0.021 ) .
dissatisfaction with current work shift schedule and frequent bruxism were both significant independent factors for all variables describing insufficient sleep consequences .
conclusion self - reported bruxism may indicate sleep problems and their adherent awake consequences in non - patient populations .
background according to recent epidemiological data , finland has a unique pattern of insomnia compared with many other european countries [ 1 ] .
the high prevalence of insomnia complaints in the nordic countries has been explained by the dark period during midwinter , which is thought to influence human circadian rhythms .
shift work has also been shown to affect the circadian rhythm and to be connected with work related problems [ 2,3 ] .
moreover , irregular shift work has been implicated as a cause of sleep disorders and tiredness , and may even expose employees to work hazards [ 4,5 ] .
currently in the finnish media industry the production and delivery of radio and tv programmes is in transition from analogue to digital techniques .
technological changes call for new professions and competence requirements , whereas some existing skills are becoming redundant .
the 24 - hour culture in modern media work , with its irregular shifts and night work , may enhance the psychological pressures of work in an already demanding work environment .
bruxism has been defined as diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional jaw muscle activity that includes clenching , bracing , gnashing and grinding of teeth [ 6 ] .
in clinical studies the prevalence of bruxism varies greatly , between 6.5 % and 88 % , while figures in epidemiologic studies are usually lower , about 6 - 8 % [ 7 - 11 ] .
recent research has increasingly focused on the unsolved etiology of bruxism , and at present , the parafunction is more often thought to be regulated centrally , not peripherally [ 12 ] .
evidence also exists that bruxism appears concomitantly with the transient arousal response , and thus may be a sign of a sleep disorder [ 13,14 ] .
self - reported bruxism was recently shown among a non - patient population to have a coherent relationship with stress and stress - related disorders [ 15 ] , and possibly to reflect intrapersonal or interpersonal reactivity [ 15 ] , or dissatisfaction [ 16 ] .
it was also found that disrupted sleep associates with bruxism and orofacial pain [ 17 ] , suggesting a vicious circle between those items .
however , whilst clinically detected bruxism may be considered as a sleep disorder in itself , the associations of self - reported bruxism and symptoms and consequenses of disturbed sleep remains far from clear .
the aims of the present study , performed in media personnel with or without irregular shift work , were firstly to investigate the occurrence of insomnia symptoms and perceived consequences of insufficient sleep , and secondly to analyze whether self - reported bruxism was associated with them .
the effects of some possible confounding factors ( viz. , restless legs syndrome , snoring , gender , age , and dissatisfaction ) relative to sleep quality were controlled .
methods in 2003 , a standardized questionnaire was mailed to all employees of the finnish broadcasting company with irregular shift work ( n = 750 ; 57.0 % men ) and to an equal number of randomly selected controls in the same company with regular eight - hour daytime work ( 42.4 % men ) .
the mean age of invited subjects was 43.0 ( sd 10.4 ) years in irregular shift work and 44.8 ( sd 10.2 ) years in day work .
the work duties of the present media personnel included journalism , broadcasting , programme production , technical support and administration .
the overall response rate was 58.3 % ( 53.7 % men ) .
the response rate in the irregular shift work group was 82.3 % ( 56.6 % men ) and in the regular daytime work group 34.3 % ( 46.7 % men ) .
the mean age of males in shift work was 45.0 ( sd 10.6 ) years and of females 42.6 ( sd 10.7 ) years ( p < 0.001 ) ; the corresponding figures for daytime workers were 47.4 ( sd 9.7 ) and 45.5 ( sd 10.1 ) years ( ns ) , respectively [ 16 ] .
the questionnaire covered demographic items , employment details , general health experience , physical status , insomnia symptoms , psychosocial status , stress , work satisfaction and performance .
for the present study , the questionnaire data used were categorized as follows : a ) demographic data : gender , age .
b ) bruxism : self - assessed frequency of tooth clenching or grinding ( never , seldom , sometimes , often , continually ) [ 15 - 17 ] .
bruxism was considered as frequent when it occurred ' often ' or ' continually ' .
c ) dissatisfaction with current workshift schedule ( irregular shifts vs. regular day time work ) d ) insomnia symptoms [ 18,19 ] : difficulties initiating sleep ( dis ) , disrupted sleep ( ds ) , and early morning awakenings ( ema ) .
a symptom was considered as present when it occurred at least three nights per week .
ema in the irregular work group means that subjects with the symptom woke up before they intended , despite the hour , and had difficulties in going back to sleep .
e ) perceived consequences of sleep : non - restorative sleep ( nrs ) ( sustained > 1 month ) , tiredness ( at least 3 days per week ) , sleep deprivation ( sld ) ( subjective need for sleep 1 h > actual sleep time ) [ 20 ] .
f ) neurological and physical confounding factors affecting sleep quality : restless legs syndrome ( rls ) : presence of the four essential diagnostic criteria according to the nih diagnosis and epidemiology workshop for rls [ 21 ] , snoring : as perceived or reported by bed partner ( at least 3 nights per week ) statistical methods student 's t - test was used to compare continuous variables .
the chi2 test was used to study associations between categorical variables .
logistic regression models were fitted to analyse the independent effects of the background variables on the probability of insomnia symptoms ( dis , ds , ema ) and insufficient sleep consequences ( nrs , tiredness , sld ) .
independent variables included in the six multivariate models were : gender ( male = 0 , female = 1 ) , age (< 45 yr = 0 , >= 45 yr = 1 ) , irregular shift work ( no = 0 , yes = 1 ) , perceived dissatisfaction with current workshift schedule ( no = 0 , yes = 1 ) , frequent bruxism ( often or continually ) ( no = 0 , yes = 1 ) , diagnosed rls ( no = 0 , yes = 1 ) , and snoring ( at least 3 nights per week ) ( no = 0 , yes = 1 ) .
the forced entry method was used , i.e. all selected independent variables were entered in a single step in each regression model .
both dependent and independent variables are described in table 1 .

the bruxism scores were evenly distributed in the irregular shift work and regular day work groups ( ns ) .
a total of 43.6 % reported disrupted sleep and 36.2 % perceived their sleep non - restorative .
the prevalence figures for perceived insomnia and insufficent sleep symptoms and their occurrences by studied subgroups are shown in table 1 .
according to logistic regression models i - iii ( table 2 ) , female gender was a significant independent factor for all insomnia symptoms , and older age for ds and ema .
frequent bruxism was significantly associated with dis ( p = 0.019 ) and ds ( p = 0.021 ) , whilst dissatisfaction with own work shifts was significantly associated with dis ( p = 0.006 ) and ema ( p = 0.001 ) .
rls was significantly associated with dis ( p = 0.023 ) , as also was snoring with ds ( p = 0.010 ) .

the study formed part of a comprehensive investigation on shift work and its sleep / awake consequences , and it focused on irregular shift work , which , however , did not emerge as a significant factor in itself .
this was a finding that accords with results from earlier studies derived from the present data base [ 15 - 17 ] .
unfortunately , despite several postal reminders , we resulted in a low response rate in the regular day work group .
this was partly expected as the study was transparently targeted to examine the health effects of irregular shift work .
the invited subjects and respondents in both shift work and day work groups were similar as regards gender and age , which , on the other hand , may modestly suggest that also the day work group could be representative .
nevertheless , due to the uneven response rates the present study may have failed in detecting the actual differences between these two groups .
however , we studied the associations of self - reported bruxism with perceived insomnia symptoms and insufficient sleep using multivariate models in which some confounding factors ( viz. , restless legs syndrome , snoring , gender , age , and dissatisfaction ) relative to sleep quality were simultaneously controlled .
bearing in mind the lower response rate in the day work group , the models were also tested excluding the work group variable , which did not markedly change the effects of the other independent variables .
thus , the work group variable was not considered to be a confounding factor in the models , and further , it was eventually included in the present analyses not to reduce the statistical power .
as the major interest was in self - reported bruxism , the main findings were that frequent bruxism was significantly associated with perceived insomnia symptoms ( except ema ) and insufficient sleep .
these associations also held in the multivariate analyses .
the results may imply a stressful work environment or work dissatisfaction , as discussed earlier [ 15 - 17 ] .
the statistically non - significant relationship found between bruxism and ema , the latter often reportedly associated with depressive mood [ 18 ] , has also been suggested to be due to the overall low psychological dysfunction found in the present non - patient population [ 22 ] .
using questionnaires , as in the present study , may cause difficulties in defining the actual prevalence of bruxism ; it may even have been more common among populations but not reported as a behaviour by individuals because of its potential subconscious nature. or , on the other hand , reporting of bruxism may be influenced by negative affectivity , and individuals with subjective distress may be more likely to perceive , overreact to and complain about their sensations .
in the present study bruxism was defined as a subjective perception of tooth grinding or clenching and the definition includes both sleep and awake parafunctions .
this also means that sleep and awake bruxism cannot be separated here .
studies have suggested that stress experience and psychosocial factors may play an important role in the etiology of bruxism [ 12 ] .
in contrast , evidence also exists that both experienced and anticipated stress associate with awake clenching but would be unrelated to sleep - bruxism recorded with ambulatory devices [ 23,24 ] .
polysomnographic studies have revealed , however , that bruxism appears concomitantly with the transient arousal response and has been shown to associate with both sleep quality and sleep architecture [ 12,14,25 ] .
on the other hand , it is well accepted that stress experiences at work are linked to disturbed sleep and fatigue [ 26,27 ] .
thus , if perceived stress or dissatisfaction affect sleep , it could be assumed that they may concomitantly precipitate or amplify bruxism .
further , fatique and pain in the masticatory muscles may be a repercussion of this process .
as regards insomnia symptoms both dis and ds were found to be markedly more common than previously reported in finland [ 1 ] .
on the other hand , the presence of ema did not differ from that reported in the general population .
also , female gender was overall associated with insomnia symptoms , which is in line with previous epidemiologic findings outside finland [ 28 - 30 ] .
in the present study , age had diverse effects ; those >= 45 years more often had ds and ema but yet the younger subjects were more likely to report insufficient sleep complaints .
as regards ds this has not been the case in the general population , but it accords with the results found elsewhere .
it is noteworthy that ds , also the most significant factor associated with bruxism , emerged as a major sleep disturbance affecting nearly half of subjects in the present non - patient population .
in the multivariate analyses , despite the several associations found cross - sectionally , rls was significantly associated only with dis .
snoring , in turn , which was bivariately associated only with ds , was multivariately associated with both ds and sld .
these findings seem logical and they also underscore that neurological or physical factors should be borne in mind when diagnosing and treating insomnia and insufficient sleep problems .
especially in the case of rls a substantial under - recognition may exist [ 31 - 33 ] .
the phenomenon of bruxism may well be genetic in origin , affected psychosocially or pathophysiologically , but is most likely centrally regulated [ 12 ] .
yet , despite the increasing number of studies on bruxism , it remains unclear why self - perceived bruxism and polysomnographically or clinically detected bruxism seem to be poorly associated and do not share their etiology .
based on the present study , however , it may be possible to conclude that self - reported bruxism indicates sleep problems and their adherent awake consequences .
also , the found independently detrimental effect of dissatisfaction on sleep should not be ignored .

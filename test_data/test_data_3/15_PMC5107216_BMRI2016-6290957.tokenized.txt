this paper investigates the protective effect of interleukin - 1 receptor antagonist ( il - 1ra ) released from hyaluronic acid chitosan ( ha - cs ) microspheres in a controlled manner on il - 1beta - induced inflammation and apoptosis in chondrocytes .
the il - 1ra release kinetics was characterized by an initial burst release , which was reduced to a linear release over eight days .
chondrocytes were stimulated with 10 ng / ml il - 1beta and subsequently incubated with ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres .
the cell viability was decreased by il - 1beta , which was attenuated by ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres as indicated by an mtt assay .
elisa showed that ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres inhibited il - 1beta - induced inflammation by attenuating increases in no2 - and prostaglandin e2 levels as well as increase in glycosaminoglycan release .
a terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick - end labeling assay revealed that the il - 1beta - induced chondrocyte apoptosis was decreased by ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres .
moreover , ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres blocked il - 1beta - induced chondrocyte apoptosis by increasing b - cell lymphoma 2 ( bcl - 2 ) and decreasing bcl - 2 - associated x protein and caspase - 3 expressions at mrna and protein levels , as indicated by reverse - transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis , respectively .
the results of the present study indicated that ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres as a controlled release system of il - 1ra possess potential anti - inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties in rat chondrocytes due to their ability to regulate inflammatory factors and apoptosis associated genes .

introduction osteoarthritis ( oa ) is an age - related degenerative disease of the joints leading to progressive cartilage damage [ 1 ] .
inflammatory cytokines and mediators trigger the underlying pathological mechanism of oa by leading to the production of various proteases which disrupt cell matrix signaling and result in the depletion of collagen and proteoglycan [ 2 ] .
interleukin - 1beta ( il - 1beta ) is one of the most important inflammatory cytokines and has a central role in the pathogenesis of oa [ 3 ] .
il - 1beta has been reported to accelerate the aging and increase the chondrocyte apoptosis which is thought to be important in oa [ 4 - 6 ] .
consequently , the inhibition of the il - 1beta pathway presents a promising means of preventing inflammation and apoptosis in chondrocytes in the pathogenesis of oa. one of the major endogenous inhibitors of the il - 1 pathway is the anti - inflammatory cytokine interleukin - 1 receptor antagonist ( il - 1ra ) which binds the il - 1ri with similar specificity and affinity to that of il - 1 , while it does not activate any downstream signals [ 7 , 8 ]. of note , il - 1ra has been demonstrated to inhibit the progression of oa , suggesting that il - 1ra is a suitable target for the treatment of oa [ 9 , 10 ] .
hyaluronic acid ( ha ) is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan and a component of cartilage matrix and synovial fluid [ 11 ] .
ha possesses anabolic , analgesic , anti - inflammatory , and chondroprotective activities [ 12 ] .
in oa , intra - articular injection of ha was shown to augment the flow of joint fluid , improve the viscoelasticity of synovial fluid , normalize endogenous hyaluronate synthesis , reduce pain , inhibit hyaluronate degradation , and improve the range of motion in the knee [ 13 , 14 ] .
a previous study by our group has demonstrated that ha dose - dependently suppressed chondrocyte apoptosis in a model of il - 1beta - induced oa [ 15 ] .
chitosan ( cs ) , an abundant polysaccharide , is obtained by deacetylation of its precursor polymer chitin [ 16 ] .
it features excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability alongside ecological safety as well as low toxicity and immunogenicity .
cs possesses versatile biological activities and applications , including antimicrobial effect and use as a scaffold in tissue engineering and a carrying system for the delivery of drugs and nucleotides [ 17 - 21 ] .
injection of cs solution into the murine knee joint caused a significant increase in the density of newly formed chondrocytes , suggesting that it could facilitate the healing of the cartilage .
cs promotes attachment , proliferation , and viability of mesenchymal stem cells , and , thanks to these promising features , cs and its derivatives are considered as very interesting biomaterials [ 22 ] .
the main problem for the treatment of oa is that anything injected into a joint tends to come back out again very quickly , which restricts the effectiveness of intra - articular treatments to acute conditions .
there is a pressing need for technologies to retain drugs in joints and thus permit sustained therapeutic responses in oa [ 23 ] .
therefore , the present study attempted to combine the virtues of ha and cs to develop il - 1ra - carrying microspheres and investigated their effect against il - 1beta - stimulated inflammation and apoptosis in rat chondrocytes in an in vitro model of oa. it indicated that ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres efficiently released il - 1ra to attenuate inflammation and apoptosis in chondrocytes and may be suitable for the treatment of oa .

4. results characterization of microspheres : the microsphere morphology was observed by sem ( figure 1 ) .
the ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres , fabricated using the emulsification method in the presence of stpp , were spherical in shape with smooth surface .
the resulting microspheres were spherical and ranged in size from 7 to 16 mum ( figure 1 ( a )) .
the microsphere surface appeared to be loose and porous , and the internal structure was cell - like ( figure 1 ( b )). with regard to the variation in composition and structure , a slight increase in the microsphere size was observed from cs - il - 1ra ( figure 1 ( c )) to ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres ( figure 1 ( d )) .
it was evident that the surface of the microspheres containing ha was more porous than that of the microspheres void of ha. the ee of il - 1ra in cs - il - 1ra or ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres were 52.6 +/ - 6.8 % and 65.3 +/ - 8.1 % , respectively .
the ee of il - 1ra in ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres was significantly higher than that of cs - il - 1ra microspheres ( p < 0.05 ) .
in vitro release profiles : figure 2 shows the release kinetics of il - 1ra from both types of microspheres .
il - 1ra release kinetics was monitored over 15 days and was characterized by an initial burst release , which was gradually reduced to a linear release .
the release rate of il - 1ra in the ha - cs - il - 1ra group was slower than that in the cs - il - 1ra group .
the final release rate was ~ 85 % in the cs - il - 1ra group within 10 days of incubation , while it was ~ 75 % in the ha - cs - il - 1ra group within the same period .
the release rate of il - 1ra in the ha - cs - il - 1ra group was significantly lower than that of il - 1ra in the cs - il - 1ra group within 10 days of incubation ( p < 0.05 ) .
in conclusion , compared with that in cs - il - 1ra group , il - 1ra was released in a slower and more continuous manner in the ha - cs - il - 1ra group .
il - 1ra - releasing microspheres attenuate il - 1beta - mediated reduction in cell viability .
figure 3 shows the cell viability in the various treatment groups .
the cell viability of control group was 73 +/ - 4 % , which was significantly lower than 93 +/ - 7 % of blank group ( p < 0.05 ) .
no significant differences in cell viability among the control ( 73 +/ - 4 %) , cs group ( 76 +/ - 5 %) , and ha - cs group ( 77 +/ - 6 %) were observed .
the cell viability of cs or ha - cs group was slightly but not significantly higher than that of control group .
however , cotreatment with ha - cs - il - 1ra or cs - il - 1ra microspheres significantly increased the cell viability to 89 +/ - 7 and 86 +/ - 6 % , respectively ( p < 0.05 versus control ) .
il - 1ra - releasing microspheres attenuated il - 1beta - induced release of no2 - , pge2 , and gag by chondrocytes .
figure 4 shows the concentrations of no2 - , pge2 , and gag in the various experimental groups .
stimulation with il - 1beta ( 10 ng / ml ) alone led to a 5.8 - fold increase in no2 - production in the supernatant ( p < 0.05 ) .
cs and ha - cs microspheres slightly but not significantly decreased no2 - production ( p > 0.05 ) , whereas cs - il - 1ra and ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres significantly decreased the no2 - production ( p < 0.05 ) .
similar effect was observed for the pge2 and gag concentrations in the supernatant , which was significantly attenuated by cs - il - 1ra and ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres ( p < 0.05 versus control ) .
il - 1ra - releasing microspheres reduced il - 1beta - induced chondrocyte apoptosis .
figure 5 shows tunel staining of chondrocytes in the different treatment groups for the apoptosis detection .
the percentage of tunel - positive cells in the control group was 37 +/ - 6 % , while that in the blank group was significantly lower at only 3 +/ - 1 % ( p < 0.05 ) .
compared with the control group , cotreatment with cs or ha - cs microspheres slightly but not significantly decreased the apoptotic rate of chondrocytes ( 37 +/ - 6 versus 35 +/ - 5 and 34 +/ - 4 % , resp. ) .
however , following coculture with cs - il - 1ra or ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres , the percentages of tunel - positive cells were 23 +/ - 4 or 21 +/ - 3 % , respectively , which were significantly lower than those in the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
il - 1ra - releasing microspheres attenuated il - 1beta - induced apoptosis signaling .
figure 6 shows the gene expressions of bcl - 2 , bax , and caspase - 3 in various experimental groups .
stimulation with il - 1beta ( 10 ng / ml ) led to a significant decrease in bcl - 2 expression but significant increases in bax and caspase - 3 expressions compared with those in the blank group ( p < 0.05 ) .
no significant differences in the gene expressions of bcl - 2 , bax , and caspase - 3 were found among the control , cs , and ha - cs groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
the gene expressions of bcl - 2 , bax , and caspase - 3 in cs or ha - cs groups were slightly but not significantly changed compared to those in the control group .
however , the bcl - 2 expression was significantly increased after cotreatment with cs - il - 1ra or ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas the expressions of bax and caspase - 3 were significantly decreased ( p < 0.05 ) after cotreatment with cs - il - 1ra or ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres compared with those in the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
however , there were no significant differences in the gene expressions of bcl - 2 , bax , and caspase - 3 between the cs - il - 1ra and ha - cs - il - 1ra groups .

however , there were no significant differences in the gene expressions of bcl - 2 , bax , and caspase - 3 between the cs - il - 1ra and ha - cs - il - 1ra groups .
5. discussion oa , which is accompanied by joint dysfunction and pain , is the most prevalent type of degenerative joint disease [ 25 ] .
it is widely accepted that increases in il - 1beta levels can lead to the production and accumulation of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and trigger apoptosis in chondrocytes [ 26 ]. of note , sustained release of il - 1ra from ha - cs microspheres to inhibit the il - 1beta pathway may prevent inflammation and apoptosis in chondrocytes .
in the present study , one of the main factors affecting the results was the microsphere structure .
as the surface of the ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres was loose and porous and the internal structure appeared cell - like , it was obvious that ha conjugation enhanced the ability of the microspheres to interact with the chondrocytes and to release the loaded drug in a controlled manner .
furthermore , the release rate of il - 1ra from the ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres was slower than that of cs - il - 1ra microspheres .
this result further confirmed that release kinetics of proteins from the microspheres was influenced by the microsphere structure .
ha , carrying high negative charges , which allow for an electrostatic interaction with protonated chitosan in an aqueous acidic solution , may have been accountable for the slow drug release .
in the current study , cs or ha - cs slightly but not significantly increased the cell viability of chondrocytes .
furthermore , the percentages of viable cells in the cs - il - 1ra and ha - cs - il - 1ra groups were significantly higher than those in the control group , with the percentage of viable cells in the ha - cs - il - 1ra group being slightly but not significantly higher than that in the cs - il - 1ra group .
these findings are in accordance with those of our previous study [ 24 ] .
in our paper , we found that cs or ha - cs slightly but not significantly decreased no2 - , pge2 , and gag , a finding consistent with previous investigations [ 27 , 28 ] .
the findings of the present study suggested that cs - il - 1ra and ha - cs - il - 1ra inhibited the production of inflammatory agents such as no2 - and pge2 , while decreasing the degradation of gag induced by il - 1beta in chondrocytes .
the accumulative production of no2 - is due to the upregulated isoform nitric oxide synthase levels due to pge2 , which has an important role in human adult articular cartilage homeostasis and is linked to the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis [ 29 ] .
gag is a polysaccharide which together with collagen type ii forms the main component of the cartilage matrix .
it has been confirmed that secretion of gag by chondrocytes cultured in vitro can be regarded as an indicator of the maintenance of the chondrocytes phenotype [ 30 ] .
in the present study , upon stimulation with il - 1beta , a significant increase was observed in the release of gag into the culture medium which was considered as an indicator of rapid proteoglycan degradation .
the gag content was rescued in the presence of cs - il - 1ra and ha - cs - il - 1ra .
this suggests that both of microspheres containing il - 1ra can contribute to inhibition of proteoglycan degradation , indicating a protective effect on chondrocytes phenotype .
our results are consistent with the previous study which showed rapid proteoglycan degradation in a cartilage - like extracellular matrix [ 31 ] .
however , slight but not significant differences in the levels of no2 - , pge2 , and gag between cs - il - 1ra and ha - cs - il - 1ra groups were identified .
these findings suggest that il - 1ra may act as an anti - inflammatory agent similar to nonsteroid anti - inflammatory drugs , which have been shown to ameliorate oa symptoms by inhibiting the production of pge2 .
in addition , il - 1ra may maintain the chondrocyte phenotype .
furthermore , it was demonstrated that the controlled release of il - 1ra by ha - cs was prolonged compared to that by cs alone , which may have been due to the highly negative charges and the bulky and gel - like characteristics of ha , which may have promoted the controlled release by modifying the bond between cs and the protein [ 32 ] .
ha simultaneously combined with cs through electrostatic interactions .
in the present study , the application of ha as a component of cs microspheres was demonstrated to be a reasonable approach for enhancing the potency of cs - il - 1ra in the treatment of chondrocytes affected by oa. consistent with the results of previous studies , the present study found that il - 1beta induced apoptosis in chondrocytes [ 33 , 34 ] .
cs or ha - cs slightly but not significantly decreased the apoptotic rate of chondrocytes .
this is in good agreement with the previous reports [ 28 , 35 ] .
however , the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly decreased in chondrocytes cotreated with cs - il - 1ra or ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres .
the percentage of apoptotic cells in the ha - cs - il - 1ra group was slightly but not significantly less than that in the cs - il - 1ra group .
it can be inferred that il - 1ra can suppress chondrocyte apoptosis in an in vitro model of il - 1beta - induced oa and that the ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres are more potent than cs - il - 1ra microspheres .
bcl - 2 , bax , and caspase - 3 are crucial biomarkers for cell apoptosis , with caspase - 3 acting as an apoptotic executor [ 36 , 37 ] .
the present study showed that cs or ha - cs slightly but not significantly changed the gene and protein levels of bcl - 2 , bax , and caspase - 3 .
our data agree with the previous reports [ 38 , 39 ] .
in addition , the expression of bcl - 2 was significantly increased in the cs - il - 1ra and ha - cs - il - 1ra groups , while the expressions of bax and caspase - 3 were decreased at the transcriptional and translational levels compared with those in the control group , with ha - cs - il - 1ra having slightly more potent effect than cs - il - 1ra .
these results further confirmed the microsphere effect on cell apoptosis and proliferation .
the suppression of inflammation and apoptosis within the joint represents a clinical treatment method for oa , in which microspheres may be employed as efficient drug - loaded carriers .
the results of the present study revealed that the sustained release of il - 1ra from ha - cs - il - 1ra microspheres prevented il - 1beta - induced inflammation and apoptosis in chondrocytes .
these results suggest that ha - cs microspheres are potent il - 1ra carriers with controlled and prolonged release properties for the treatment of oa. acknowledgments the authors would like to thank to the department of orthopedics in renmin hospital of wuhan university .

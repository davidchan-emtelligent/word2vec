the original hydrogen isotope ( d / h ) ratios of different planetary bodies may indicate where each body formed in the solar system .
however , geological and atmospheric processes can alter these ratios through time .
over the past few decades , d / h ratios in meteorites from vesta and mars , as well as from s - and c - type asteroids , have been measured .
the aim of this article is to bring together all previously published data from these bodies , as well as the earth , in order to determine the original d / h ratio for each of these inner solar system planetary bodies .
once all secondary processes have been stripped away , the inner solar system appears to be relatively homogeneous in terms of water d / h , with the original water d / h ratios of vesta , mars , the earth , and s - and c - type asteroids all falling between deltad values of - 100 / 1000 and - 590 / 1000 .
this homogeneity is in accord with the ' grand tack ' model of solar system formation , where giant planet migration causes the s - and c - type asteroids to be mixed within 1 au to eventually form the terrestrial planets .
this article is part of the themed issue ' the origin , history and role of water in the evolution of the inner solar system ' .

d / h ratio models of the early solar system theoretical studies of interstellar chemistry show that in astrophysical environments , at temperatures less than 50 k , water becomes enriched in deuterium ( 2h or d ) relative to molecular hydrogen , with d / h ratios reaching 0.001 - 0.01 [ 1 - 5 ] .
these theoretical studies are supported by astronomical observations of d - rich water ( d / h = 0.001 - 0.08 ) in the envelopes surrounding protostars [ 6,7 ] .
thus , prior to the formation of our sun , water in the molecular cloud would have had a high d / h ratio .
however , when this d - rich water is incorporated into the hot inner region of a protoplanetary disc , isotopic exchange reactions occur with other hydrogen - bearing species ( e.g. h2o + hd < - - > hdo + h2 ) , which dramatically lower the d / h ratio ( e.g. [ 8 - 15 ]) .
isotopic exchange occurs more rapidly at high temperatures , meaning water in the inner regions of the disc would equilibrate with h2 gas , producing low d / h ratios of approximately 2 x 10 - 5 [ 16 ]. by contrast , because isotopic exchange is sluggish at low temperatures , water in the outer regions of the disc would preserve its original high d / h ratio from the molecular cloud .
therefore , after the sun 's formation the d / h ratio of water in the evolving protoplanetary disc would have been dependent ( at least initially ) on the temperature of the surrounding environment , and thus distance from the sun .
measurements of d / h ratios in oort cloud comet ( occ ) water are highly variable ( 1.4 - 6.5 x 10 - 4 ) , with the lowest measured ratio being similar to terrestrial ocean water [ 17 - 29 ] .
the jupiter family comets ( jfcs ) hartley 2 and 45p / honda - mrkos - pajdusakova have low water d / h ratios ( 1.61 and less than 2.0 x 10 - 4 ) [ 30,31 ] , whereas the rosina mass spectrometer aboard the rosetta spacecraft measured a high d / h ratio ( three times that of the earth 's oceans ) in water vapour sublimated from the jfc 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko [ 32 ] .
the overlap in d / h ratios , along with other indistinguishable chemical and physical characteristics [ 33 ] , argues for a common parent population for the occs and jfcs [ 34 ] .
however , d / h ratio variation implies the parent population formed over a long period of time or distance from the sun .
as an added complication , all these measurements are of sublimated water from the surface of comets , thus probably do not represent the bulk comet d / h ratio .
yang et al .
[ 16 ] coupled a dynamic model of material transport and mixing with a kinetic study of d - h isotopic exchange in an attempt to explain the variation in cometary d / h ratios , and to produce a picture of the first 1 myr of solar system history ( figure 1a ) .
these authors found that , during the very earliest stages of the protoplanetary disc ( approx. 0.1 myr after formation ) , viscous spreading may have redistributed low d / h ratio water from the inner to the very outer disc regions ( figure 1a ) .
inside of 2 au the d / h ratio of water is shown to be almost equal to that of molecular hydrogen .
viscous spreading would have redistributed this low d / h water throughout the protoplanetary disc by 0.1 myr .
at a later stage ( approx. 0.2 myr ) , molecular cloud infall begins to add high d / h water to the disc .
in the inner disc , this molecular cloud water exchanges with molecular hydrogen , and the d / h ratio remains low .
beyond 2 au low temperatures prevent this exchange and the d / h of water reflects the high ratio of the molecular cloud , with maximum values at approximately 3 au and 10 au in the 0.2 myr and 0.3 myr snapshots , respectively ( figure 1a ) .
however , this infall does not affect the outermost part of the disc , hence the d / h ratio of water remains low in this region .
therefore , observed cometary d / h variation can be explained if the parent population contained material from both the outer low d / h region and the approximately 2 - 10 au high d / h region .
figure 1 .
d / h ratio evolution in the early solar system .
isotopic equilibration with molecular hydrogen results in a low water d / h ratio in the hot inner disc ( less than 2 au ) for the first approximately 0.3 myr after the sun 's formation ( a ; adapted from [ 16 ]). by contrast , outer disc water ( approx. 2 - 40 au ) remains unequilibrated , retaining the high d / h ratios inherited from the molecular cloud .
beyond approximately 0.3 myr turbulent mixing produces a more uniform d / h distribution in the outer disc , with some molecular - hydrogen - equilibrated water being transported beyond the snowline to the region where the chondritic meteorites formed ( b ; adapted from [ 35 ]) .
beyond 0.3 myr after the formation of the protoplanetary disc , once molecular cloud infall stops , turbulent mixing results in a more uniform d / h ratio in the outer disc .
gas turbulence would also result in some of the low d / h water from the inner disc being transported beyond the snowline , to the region where the chondritic meteorites are thought to have formed ( figure 1b ) .
therefore , water in these meteorites should be composed of both an h2 equilibrated water component from the inner disc and a cometary water component that drifted inwards from the outer disc [ 35 ] .
transport and mixing would have been particularly efficient in the early stages of disc evolution , if the disc was first built compact and then expanded because of turbulence [ 36 ] .
this expansion is consistent with the presence of crystalline silicates in comets [ 20 ] .
2. d / h ratio measurements d / h ratios are commonly quoted relative to vienna standard mean ocean water ( vsmow ; d / h = 1.5576 x 10 - 4 ) using the notation deltad = {[( d / h ) unknown /( d / h ) vsmow ] - 1 } x 1000 , in units of parts per thousand ( per mil (/ 1000 )) .
this means vsmow has a deltad value of 0 / 1000 .
deuterium - enriched reservoirs have high deltad values ( e.g. interstellar water deltad =~ + 10 000 / 1000 [ 37 ]) , and d - poor reservoirs have low values ( e.g. protosolar disc deltad =~ - 870 / 1000 [ 38 ]) .
this notation will be used in the following sections to compare the d / h ratios of various different extraterrestrial materials .
( a ) eucrites eucrites belong to the howardite - eucrite - diogenite group of meteorites that are derived from the asteroid belt , dominantly from the asteroid vesta [ 39 - 41 ] .
these basaltic meteorites are some of the oldest igneous rocks in the solar system , mostly having crystallized only approximately 8 - 20 myr after the first solids formed [ 42,43 ] .
sarafian et al .
[ 44 ] measured the d / h ratio of structurally bound water in eucrite apatite [ ca5 ( po4 ) 3 ( oh,f,cl )] , reporting deltad values of between - 231 / 1000 and - 37 / 1000 from five different meteorites .
the authors state that these values probably reflect the original d / h ratio of the parent body ( vesta ) .
as the apatite grains have young cosmic ray exposure ages , high water contents and a small range of d / h ratios across the different exposure ages and metamorphic grades , contamination by exogenic h from solar wind and / or by d produced during spallation processes is unlikely [ 44 ] .
degassing could have raised the d / h ratio from its original value , because of the preferential evaporation of the lighter hydrogen isotope .
however , the small observed spread in deltad with the relatively large spread of water contents in the analysed apatite indicates that degassing did not occur in these meteorites [ 45,46 ] .
stable isotope fractionation between apatite and melt is expected to be small ( approx. 20 / 1000 ) at high temperatures ; thus , apatite - melt fractionation should be minor relative to the variation in deltad observed [ 47 ] .
therefore , none of these three processes substantially affected the h isotopic compositions measured [ 44 ] .
as each apatite grain is stoichiometric , hydrogen contamination via terrestrial weathering is ruled out .
( b ) carbonaceous chondrites reported bulk rock d / h ratios for the carbonaceous chondrites vary between deltad values of + 2150 / 1000 and - 229 / 1000 [ 48,49 ] .
however , these values are not representative of chondritic water alone , as the bulk rock includes hydrogen within insoluble organic material ( iom ) .
hydrous phyllosilicate is present in the ci , cm and tagish lake carbonaceous chondrites , as well as in a number of cr and cv meteorites .
however , it is intergrown with iom at the micrometre scale , meaning physical separation is not possible .
alexander et al .
[ 49 ] calculated the d / h ratio of water in the cm and cr chondrite groups by comparing the bulk rock d / h and c / h ratios of group members showing different degrees of aqueous alteration .
assuming the bulk hydrogen isotopic compositions are produced by simple mixing of hydrated silicates and iom , the bulk compositions should form a line on a plot of deltad versus c / h , with the hydrogen isotope intercept giving the isotopic composition of water .
the cm and cr chondrites do form a line on this type of plot , producing calculated water d / h ratios of - 444 +/ - 23 / 1000 and + 96 (+ 110 / - 65 )/ 1000 , respectively [ 49 ] .
the ci chondrites , along with the most primitive co and cv chondrites , are not common enough to use the above approach .
however , the ci 's orgueil and ivuna , along with the co alh 77307 , fall on the cm trend , suggesting that they all probably had similar initial water compositions ( table 1 ) .
if all chondrites accreted a common iom component [ 60 ] , chondrite water contents can also be calculated via subtraction of this component .
this method is especially useful for those c - chondrite groups with only one or a few members ( cis , cos , cvs and tagish lake ). by applying this methodology , alexander et al .
[ 49 ] calculated that c - chondrite water has current d / h ratios between deltad - 587 / 1000 and + 207 / 1000 ( table 1 ) .

in addition , the d / h ratio of water in the oc semarkona is much higher than the ratios of the carbonaceous chondrites ( deltad = 798 - 1209 / 1000 [ 49 ]) .
these high d / h ratios appear to be a product of oxidation in the meteorite , rather than a reflection of the original parent body d / h ratio - - water becomes isotopically heavy due to the oxidation of fe and the loss of isotopically very light h2 .
this heavy water then exchanges with the iom .
the rumuruti ( r ) chondrites are highly oxidized , containing rare or no fe - ni metal , as well as abundant ferromagnesian minerals rich in fe3 + ( e.g. [ 62,63 ]) .
direct measurements of water d / h ratios are possible in the r - chondrite lapaz icefield ( lap ) 04840 , because it ( uniquely ) contains abundant oh - bearing silicate minerals ( approx. 13 % ferri - magnesiohornblende and approx. 0.4 % phlogopite by volume ) , as well as rare apatite [ 63 ] .
the d / h ratio of water in lap 04840 hornblende and phlogopite ranges from deltad 3595 / 1000 to 3743 / 1000 and from deltad 2739 / 1000 to 3043 / 1000 , respectively ( table 1 ) .
as with the ocs , oxidation of fe by water could also produce such d enrichments in the remaining water .
oxidation also destroys iom , releasing d - rich hydrogen into the chondrite matrix .
this hydrogen is subsequently incorporated into hornblende and phlogopite during their metamorphic formation [ 63 ] .
r - chondrites are more oxidized ( near the quartz - fayalite - magnetite buffer ) than the ocs , which explains their higher water d / h ratios [ 63 ] .
( d ) mars in contrast to the asteroidal parent bodies of the eucrites and chondrites , mars is large enough to have retained a substantial atmosphere .
therefore , it has at least two separate hydrogen isotope reservoirs ( possibly three ; see [ 64 ]) .
the atmospheric reservoir and the interior mantle reservoir are completely separated , because mars has no plate tectonics .
therefore , there has been no recycling of atmospherically equilibrated crustal material back into the mantle .
the current martian atmosphere is deuterium enriched , with ratios ranging from deltad 0 - 2000 / 1000 in high - altitude regions to deltad 7000 / 1000 in the polar regions [ 65 ] .
the d / h ratio of mars' atmosphere at gale crater , measured in situ by the mars curiosity rover , was reported as deltad 4950 +/ - 1080 / 1000 [ 59 ] .
these high d / h ratios are caused by the preferential loss of the lighter hydrogen isotope to space via jeans escape [ 66 ] .
hence , over geological time the d / h ratio of the martian atmosphere is expected to have increased .
high atmospheric d / h ratios are represented in martian meteorites via secondary alteration minerals .
the nakhlite group of meteorites contain martian aqueous alteration assemblages , consisting of smectite phyllosilicate , siderite carbonate , sulfates , fe - oxides and hydroxides , and halite ( e.g. [ 67 - 79 ]) .
these assemblages have been reported to contain high d / h ratios ( up to deltad 1165 / 1000 [ 56 ]) , although wide variability highlights the ease of isotopic exchange between certain alteration minerals and the terrestrial atmosphere .
however , the maximum value in this case provides a minimum for the martian atmosphere at the time of alteration formation ( 633 ma [ 80 ]) .
allan hills ( alh ) 84001 is the most ancient martian meteorite , having crystallized at approximately 4.1 ga ( e.g. [ 81,82 ]) .
this orthopyroxenite contains small carbonate rosettes ( less than 200 microm diameter ) , which are zoned from ca and fe rich to mg rich [ 83 - 87 ] , and are reported to have formed at approximately 3.9 ga [ 88 ] .
d / h ratios vary in these carbonates between deltad 182 / 1000 and 2092 / 1000 [ 89,90 ] .
this variation may be caused by different levels of terrestrial contamination , which would drag the d / h ratio down towards 0 / 1000 .
alternatively , or perhaps in addition , the high shock pressures experienced by this meteorite [ 86,91 - 93 ] could have caused shock implantation of atmospheric hydrogen into carbonate , driving the d / h ratio higher in the most shocked grains ( see below ) .
if meteorite alteration mineral d / h ratios are plotted in conjunction with current atmospheric measurements , as well as in situ lithological measurements from the curiosity rover [ 94 ] , a picture of atmospheric loss over time is produced ( figure 2 ) .
these data suggest a linear increase in the atmospheric d / h ratio with time , and an origin of approximately 0 / 1000 .
this low initial d / h ratio supports a volcanic origin for mars' atmosphere , because measurements of melt inclusion ( mi ) glass and apatite in the most primitive and least shocked martian meteorites indicate that the d / h ratio of mars' mantle is low ( deltad < 275 / 1000 [ 57,58 ]) .
however , not all hydrous primary ( igneous ) minerals contain d / h ratios representative of the martian mantle reservoir ( figure 3 ) .
in fact , the majority of these minerals have d / h ratios somewhere between low mantle and high crustal / atmospheric ratios ( assuming the crust and atmosphere are equilibrated , but see [ 64 ]) .
there are a number of ways that these intermediate d / h ratios can be produced , both pre - and post - crystallization .
figure 2 .
the evolution of d / h ratio in the martian atmosphere over time .
previous estimates of atmospheric d / h increase used alh 84001 apatite d / h to suggest a rapid initial hydrogen ( and general atmospheric ) loss prior to 4.1 ga ( e.g. [ 65 ]) .
however , as alh 84001 is a highly shocked meteorite that is reported to contain a crustal assimilant , the d / h ratio of its apatite may not be representative of the martian atmosphere at the time of crystallization .
figure 3 .
( a - e ) d / h ratio ( deltad ) versus water content in martian igneous minerals .
high - impact shock pressures , mantle source enrichment and crustal assimilation can add d - rich atmospheric hydrogen to igneous minerals , meaning the majority do not have d / h ratios representative of the martian mantle ( deltad < 275 / 1000 , orange envelope ) .
see the electronic supplementary material for data and references .
in contrast to eucrite apatite d / h ratios , apatite in the shergottites and alh 84001 shows a distinct trend of increasing d / h with decreasing water content ( figure 3b ) .
this trend is also weakly apparent in alh 84001 feldspathic glass ( figure 3d ) , and is characteristic of h2 degassing from a melt [ 45,46 ]. by contrast , nakhla apatite d / h ratios stay constantly low over a range of water contents , indicating a lack of degassing in this melt .
these low d / h ratios probably represent the martian mantle reservoir .
a similar d / h trend is visible in chassignite amphiboles ( figure 3c ) .
however , instead of each meteorite exhibiting a range of d / h and water contents , two separate chassignites display very different amphibole compositions [ 95 ] .
the high shock pressures experienced by meteorites upon ejection from the martian surface may affect their isotopic ratios , especially for volatile elements .
experimental studies have shown that shock devolatilization of amphibole decreases its water content while simultaneously increasing the d / h ratio , because the lighter isotope is preferentially lost [ 96,97 ] .
hydrogen implantation from the surrounding atmosphere was also reported during these experiments , which would exaggerate the d / h increase under martian atmospheric conditions .
this trend of dehydration with a strong d / h increase is visible in chassignite amphibole , with amphibole in the highly shocked chassignite nwa 2737 showing much higher d / h ratios and lower water contents than that in chassigny ( figure 3c [ 95 ]) .
shergottite feldspathic glass shows an increase in d / h ratio with increasing shock - - alha 77005 is the most shocked shergottite [ 98 ] and contains glass with the highest d / h ratios , whereas zagami and shergotty are two of the least shocked and contain glass with lower d / h ratios ( figure 3d ) .
however , in contrast to hydrous amphibole , feldspathic glass contains much lower amounts of water , meaning hydrogen implantation overprints any hydrogen loss through devolatilization , and the overall water abundance increases with increasing shock .
the d / h ratio of mi glass follows a different trend from that of feldspathic glass , largely because the former contains more water ( figure 3e ) .
the d / h ratios are low ( deltad <= 275 / 1000 ) in the mi glass of chassigny [ 90 ] , as well as the depleted and intermediate shergottites yamato 098459 and alha 77005 , respectively [ 58,90 ] .
these low d / h ratios are probably representative of the martian mantle. by contrast , mi glass in the enriched shergottites grv 020090 and lar 06319 contains highly elevated d / h ratios ( deltad 3386 - 6034 / 1000 [ 58,99 ]) .
based on the light rare - earth - element abundance of lar 06319 melt inclusions , basu sarbadhikari et al .
[ 100 ] reported that this meteorite probably derived its enrichment properties from partial melting of an enriched and oxidized mantle reservoir .
thus , the enriched component in these shergottites must have been rich in water equilibrated with the martian atmosphere .
such enrichment explains why apatite in the depleted shergottite que 94201 contains lower d / h ratios than apatite in the enriched shergottites ( figure 3b ) .
the d / h ratio of erupting melts on mars could also be increased by assimilation of crustal material rich in atmospheric hydrogen , such as soil , sediments or ice .
based on sulfur isotope ratios , the shergottite los angeles is reported to contain assimilated crustal material , as are nakhla and alh 84001 [ 101 ] .
however , los angeles is an enriched shergottite , so its parental melt would have had high d / h ratios prior to any assimilation .
indeed , other enriched shergottites that have not assimilated crustal material ( e.g. shergotty and zagami [ 101 ]) , contain apatite with similar d / h ratios to that in los angeles ( figure 3b ) .
therefore , crustal assimilation does not appear to have had a significant effect on apatite d / h ratio in this meteorite , probably because the melt and assimilant had similar d / h ratios .
nakhla apatite has low d / h ratios reported to represent the martian mantle [ 57 ] .
incorporation of atmosphere - equilibrated assimilant water should have increased the d / h ratio of these apatites , indicating that the nakhla assimilant did not contain abundant water .
alh 84001 apatite d / h ratios appear to be elevated from the range of the mantle because of degassing .
however , only two apatite grains have been measured in this meteorite ( deltad 751 / 1000 and 2998 / 1000 ; [ 90 ] and [ 102 ] , respectively ) , hence much more data are needed before any conclusions can be drawn about the effects of assimilation on the water content of alh 84001 .
( e ) the earth a range of d / h ratio values are found on earth ( table 1 ) .
the hydrological cycle fractionates hydrogen , creating glacial ice ( standard greenland ice sheet precipitation ( gisp ) deltad = - 190 / 1000 [ 53 ] ; standard light antarctic precipitation 2 deltad = - 427.5 / 1000 [ 103 ]) , ocean water ( vsmow deltad = 0 / 1000 [ 52 ]) and fresh water ( deltad = 0 to - 300 / 1000 [ 51 ]) reservoirs .
in contrast to mars , the earth 's atmospheric and mantle water reservoirs are not kept separate , because subduction provides a means to mix surface water back into the mantle .
this mixing produces a variation in mantle deltad from - 126 / 1000 to + 46 / 1000 via slab dehydration and sediment recycling [ 104,105 ] .
mid - ocean ridge basalt ( morb ) source d / h ratios are more uniformly mixed , forming a narrow range of deltad - 60 +/ - 5 / 1000 [ 54 ] .
however , none of these reservoirs are likely to represent the earth 's original d / h ratio .
the earth 's atmosphere is not a closed system .
experimentally based chemical models suggest jeans escape could have caused an increase in the earth 's atmospheric d / h ratio of between a factor of 2 and 9 since the formation of the planets [ 106 ] .
plate tectonic mixing ensures this change has been incorporated into the mantle .
in addition , collisions with hydrogen - bearing planetesimals or cometary material after the earth 's accretion could have altered the d / h ratio of the planet 's surface and upper mantle [ 107 ] .
therefore , to determine the earth 's original d / h ratio a reservoir that has been completely unaffected by these surface and upper mantle changes is required .
although alternative theories exist ( e.g. [ 108 ]) , most studies suggest that high 3he / 4he ratios in some ocean island basalts indicate the existence of relatively undegassed regions in the deep mantle compared with the upper mantle , which retain a greater proportion of their primordial he [ 109,110 ] .
early tertiary ( 60 myr ) picrites from baffin island and west greenland , which represent volcanic rocks from the proto / early iceland mantle plume , contain the highest recorded terrestrial 3he / 4he ratios [ 109,110 ] .
these picrites also have pb and nd isotopic ratios consistent with primordial mantle ages ( 4.45 - 4.55 ga ) [ 111 ] , indicating the persistence of an ancient , isolated reservoir in the mantle .
the undegassed and primitive nature [ 112 ] of this reservoir means that it could preserve the earth 's initial d / h ratio .
indeed , the d / h ratios of mi glass in these picrites extend lower than any previously measured mantle values ( deltad - 97 / 1000 to - 218 / 1000 [ 55 ]) .
3. do the measurements fit the models ?
measurements of meteorites from vesta , c - type asteroids ( carbonaceous chondrites ) and mars , along with terrestrial primitive deep mantle material , indicate the initial d / h ratios of water in these planetary bodies lie between approximately deltad + 200 / 1000 and - 590 / 1000 [ 44,49,55,57,58 ] .
this range could be narrowed if the most negative values from the martian mantle ( deltad approx. - 100 / 1000 [ 57,90 ]) are assumed to be the most representative ( with the least input from the d - enriched martian atmosphere ) .
in addition , the cr chondrites have more positive water d / h ratios than the other c - chondrite groups , which may be a product of oxidation rather than a reflection of the original parent body d / h ratio [ 113,114 ] .
if this is the case , the range of inner solar system water d / h can be reduced to approximately deltad - 100 / 1000 to - 590 / 1000 .
therefore , compared with the outer solar system ( e.g. [ 32 ]) , the water d / h ratios of inner solar system materials appear relatively homogeneous .
in order to determine whether the terrestrial planets sourced their volatiles from c - chondrites , the bulk d / h of these chondrites should be considered , including contributions from organics and possibly nebular hydrogen .
the range of c - chondrite bulk d / h is considerably wider than that for just h2o , and stretches to much more positive values ( deltad = - 229 / 1000 to + 2150 / 1000 [ 48,49 ]) .
for the ci and cm chondrites at least , the water / metal ratios appear to have been high , based on bulk h and c contents [ 115 ] and the degree of aqueous alteration ( e.g. [ 116 - 119 ]) .
hence , hydrogen isotopic fractionation due to oxidation should not have been significant on these parent bodies .
c - chondrite parent bodies ( c - type asteroids ) could originally have had lower bulk deltad values if they lost significant water / ice during and after accretion .
the heat of accretion could have caused expulsion of water from the warm interiors to the surface / near surface , where it would re - freeze .
these ice - rich surfaces may have been stripped off over time by impacts and sublimation ( c. alexander 2017 , personal communication ) .
heating , freezing and sublimation all preferentially leave behind the heavier hydrogen isotope , meaning residual parent body water would become d - enriched ( increased deltad value ) .
organics would become similarly enriched via isotopic exchange .
there is remote - sensing evidence for ice at the surface of at least some c - type asteroids today [ 120,121 ] .
however , in the absence of sample return or in situ exploration , this theory remains speculative .
based on observations of extrasolar planetary discs , it is thought that jupiter and saturn formed a few million years after the formation of the protoplanetary disc [ 122 ] .
this places gas giant formation and migration after the period of hydrogen isotope equilibration in the disc [ 16 ] and the formation of the chondritic parent bodies [ 35 ] ( figure 1 ) .
gas - driven inward and outward migration of the giant planets is estimated to have occurred on a time scale of hundreds of thousands of years [ 123 ] .
the terrestrial planets' characteristics , including mars' relatively small mass , are best reproduced if these planets formed within a disc that had an outer edge at 1 au [ 124,125 ] .
these conditions can be reproduced by jupiter 's inward migration to 1.5 au and subsequent outward migration - - the ' grand tack ' model of solar system formation [ 126 ] .
inward migration scatters and mixes s - and c - type asteroids ( the parent bodies of o - and c - chondrites , respectively ) within this 1 au terrestrial planet - forming region .
s - type asteroids from 1 to 3 au are reported to make up most of this mixed material [ 126 ] .
if oxidation occurred before terrestrial planet accretion the water content of the s - type asteroids would be much lower , and the d / h ratio of the remaining water much higher ( deltad = 798 - 1209 / 1000 [ 49 ]) , than that measured for the terrestrial planets .
complete oxidation of the metal in ocs is estimated to take hundreds to 10 000 years [ 61 ] , with several million years required before this for parent body accretion and heating to the point that oxidation can take place .
however , the grand tack model indicates that the terrestrial planets accreted much later than chondrites , 30 - 50 myr after the formation of ca,al - rich inclusions [ 126,127 ] .
in support of this time scale , w isotope data from lunar samples suggest that the earth - moon system formed approximately 30 - 100 ma after the formation of the solar system [ 128 ] .
therefore , oc oxidation does appear to have occurred prior to terrestrial planet formation , hence oc 's d / h ratio would have been high at the time of planetary accretion .
this problem can be overcome if a significant proportion of c - chondrite material accreted during terrestrial planet formation .
as the ocs are extremely water - poor compared with the c - chondrites , the latter 's d / h could overprint that of the ocs - - semarkona is by far the most water - rich oc with 0.09 - 0.1 wt % h , versus 0.17 - 1.36 wt % h for the c - chondrites [ 49 ] .
based on the earth 's bulk elemental and isotopic composition , numerous studies have attempted to recreate the earth from different types and proportions of chondritic meteorites ( e.g. [ 129 ]) .
however , none of these studies have been able to successfully recreate the abundances of all elements .
nitrogen isotope ratios ( 15n / 14n ) appear to be relatively homogeneous between vesta , the moon , mars and the earth , but the c - chondrites , particularly the crs and cms , have heavier n isotope ratios ([ 44,130 ] and references therein ) .
in addition , terrestrial noble gas ( ne and xe ) signatures from primitive mantle sources suggest the presence of a solar component [ 131,132 ] .
therefore , accretion of some nebula gas or solar wind is the only way to explain the bulk earth , mars ( and probably the other terrestrial planet ) compositions .
protosolar nebula water adsorption has been suggested as an alternative theory for the source of inner solar system planetary body water .
the temperature was high at 1 au during the early solar system , but 1000 - 500 k would still allow adsorption of 25 - 300 % of the earth 's ocean water onto fractal grains during the earth 's accretion [ 133 ] .
asaduzzaman et al .
[ 134 ] used density functional theory calculations to determine the amount of water that olivine surfaces could retain in the solar nebula .
these authors found that water can be retained on adsorption surfaces at temperatures up to 900 k. in addition , if enough water is present in the nebula it may penetrate beyond the olivine grain surface to produce serpentine and brucite .
this mechanism would be valid for all inner solar system rocky materials .
however , current models have been unable to accurately reproduce the d / h ratios of these inner solar system bodies , as the protosolar nebula has a much lower d / h ratio than the range measured in inner solar system meteorites ( deltad =~ - 870 / 1000 [ 38 ]) .
in addition , it is unlikely that protosolar adsorption is a valid mechanism for the delivery of other volatile elements ( e.g. c , n and noble gases ) .
4. summary once the effects of secondary processes are removed , the original hydrogen isotope ratios of water in the earth , mars and vesta , along with the c - and s - type asteroids , cover a relatively narrow range ( approx. deltad - 100 / 1000 to - 590 / 1000 ) .
this relative water homogeneity indicates that these materials shared a water source .
the differentiated bodies ( the earth , mars and vesta ) could have sourced their water from the c - and s - type asteroids , as the latter formed prior to terrestrial planet accretion .
oxidation of s - type asteroids almost certainly occurred prior to terrestrial planet accretion in the early solar system , causing an increase in the bulk rock d / h ratio .
however , the low water content of the s - type asteroids means their high d / h ratio could have been overprinted , at least in part , by the low d / h ratio of the c - type asteroids , which have much higher water contents .
this simplistic view is complicated by the fact that no combination of chondrite meteorite compositions ( as a proxy for parental asteroid compositions ) has been able to recreate the bulk earth .
in particular , nitrogen and noble gases suggest that solar wind or nebula gas played a role in the earth 's formation .
inner solar system nebula hydrogen gas ( h2 ) or solar wind would have had a low d / h ratio at the time of terrestrial planet formation , thus this addition could have further overprinted the high d / h ratios of the s - type asteroid component in the terrestrial planets .

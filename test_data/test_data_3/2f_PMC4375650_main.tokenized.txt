2011 elsevier b.v.open access under cc by 3.0 license despite the rapid advances in solid state technologies such as the silicon photomultiplier ( sipm ) , microchannel plate ( mcp ) photomultipliers still offer a proven and practical technological solution for high channel count pixellated photon - counting systems with very high time resolution .
we describe progress towards a 256 channel optical photon - counting system using cern - developed nino and htdc asics , and designed primarily for time resolved spectroscopy in life science applications .
having previously built and demonstrated a 18 mm diameter prototype tube with an 8x8 channel readout configuration and < 43 ps rms single photon timing resolution , we are currently developing a 40 mm device with a 32x32 channel readout .
initially this will be populated with a 256 channel electronics system comprising four sets of modular 64 channel preamplifier / discriminator , and time - to - digital converter units , arranged in a compact three dimensional configuration .
we describe the detector and electronics design and operation , and present performance measurements from the 256 channel development system .
we discuss enhancements to the system including higher channel count and the use of application specific on - board signal processing capabilities .
keywords microchannel plate photon counting detector picosecond timing multi - channel fluorescence lifetime imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy high content single molecule imaging 1 introduction this work is being carried out within a project called " information rich imaging of cells " ( irpics ) and is funded through the bbsrc technology development research initiative scheme .
the hardware goal of the project is to develop a high throughput multi - channel photomultiplier with picosecond event timing for high content imaging in life science applications using time resolved spectroscopy .
irpics has built on the achievements of the hicontent project [ 1,2 ] , an stfc funded proof - of - principle demonstration of a small pore microchannel plate photomultiplier with a discrete pixel readout .
each pixel is read out using high speed multi - channel electronics comprising asics developed at cern for the lhc experiment .
the goals for irpics are to increase the channel count and improve throughput , to integrate detector and electronics into a viable system to interface with a standard optical microscope as a replacement for a commercial camera , and to have a digital processing system capable of being reprogrammed for a range of applications e.g. fluorescence lifetime imaging , fluorescence correlation spectroscopy , etc .
using techniques such as forster resonance energy transfer .
one of the primary applications at which irpics is aimed is time correlated single photon counting ( tcspc ) .
in conventional single channel tcspc , illumination intensity must be maintained sufficiently low to ensure that the probability of a second fluorescence photon occurring within the dead time of the detector is negligible ; otherwise the preferential loss of late photons that this causes distorts the decay time calculation .
this limitation is mitigated in multi - channel devices since the second photon may be detected in a parallel channel and not lost [ 3 ] .
irpics , having up to 1024 channels is expected to allow an increase in illumination intensity of several orders of magnitude compared to conventional tcspc operation .
2 detector design the irpics detector upper mechanical design , comprising photocathode and microchannel plate , is very similar to that used for hicontent , apart from the larger mcp pore diameter ( 5 mum as opposed to 3 mum ) , which is required because of the unavailability of the smaller pore size in the larger mcp sizes .
a multilayer ceramic ( mlc ) provides the pixellated readout and acts as the rear wall of the vacuum tube , incorporating 1028 electrical vacuum feed - throughs .
the same mlc manufacturing technology used by cern for the hicontent 8x8 readout is being used .
however the detector size has increased 18 mm to 40 mm and the pixel format from 8x8 pixel2 to 32x32 pixel2 , and the pitch reduced from 1.6 mm to 0.88 mm , almost quadrupling the geometric channel density. fig. 1 shows a photo of the detecting surface of the 32x32 pixel2 mlc .
each pad is connected by a via to the corresponding pad on the opposite surface .
four additional vias and pads provide connection for the surrounding guard anode .
owing to the higher force anticipated for spring - loaded electrical connections , the method of integration with the detector body design was changed from hicontent .
the mlc now forms the detector base so that the clamping force is transmitted directly through the ceramic , as opposed to the previous arrangement where it was transmitted through a kovar flange brazed to the ceramic .
the hicontent prototype detector , with its relatively coarse 8x8 pixel format at 1.6 mm pixel pitch , utilized a pogo - pin array to provide electrical contact for the readout .
this proved problematic to assemble and somewhat unreliable even with only 64 contacts .
the baseline solution for the 32x32 pixel2 irpics readout anode ( all connections must be made irrespective of channel aggregation later in the chain ) was to use a land grid array ( lga ) socket technique using miniature spring - loaded pins .
while this is used routinely for chip to board interconnects , the custom devices for which we were quoted required a compression of several 10 's of kilograms for our 1028 pin mlc , and the mechanical complications that this generated led us to investigate alternative , demountable methods .
various types of anisotropic conductive films ( acf ) have been developed recently .
we have selected , tested and proven a particular acf material , manufactured by shin - etsu polymer co. ltd. of type mt - p [ 4 ] .
this acf comprises a regular array of plated wires at a pitch of 0.1 mm embedded in and slightly projecting from , a sheet of silicone rubber 0.25 mm thick .
this is clamped between the two mating contact surfaces , which have geometrically matching pad arrays .
we manufactured pcbs with representative pad sizes and a simple jig to test the consistency and reliability of the acf material .
the pad size was 0.4 mm and solder balls were manufactured on one set of pads to increase the local pressure and acf deformation and promote contact .
a photo of the test jig and results showing the consistency of contact resistance of the 155 contacts measured are shown in fig. 2. 3 system design since the irpics system was primarily designed to be fitted to a typical optical microscope for use in biological research e.g. fluorescence lifetime imaging , we have integrated and miniaturized the system into a format so that it can easily be retro - fitted in place of a commercial camera system .
this requirement has driven the system dimensions and choice of detector mount .
the completed has dimensions of 100x100x150 mm3 approx. and utilizes a canon c - mount for the microscope interface .
though the irpics detector has been designed with a 1024 pixel readout , arranged in a 32x32 format , we have chosen initially to multiplex the outputs into groups of 2x2 pixel2 per electronics channel .
the 256 channels are instrumented with four sets of modular 64 channel pulse processing chains .
the detector mounts on a headboard , which distributes the signals to the processing chains , each of which comprises a front - end board closely coupled to a time - to - digital ( tdc ) convertor board .
the front - end board houses two 32 channel nino asics [ 5 ] , which are custom designed for this project .
they are a low power , higher channel modification of the original 8 channel nino asic [ 6 ] , a multi - channel preamplifier / discriminator chip .
each modular tdc board utilizes two 32 channel hptdc asics [ 7 ] .
both asics were originally designed for the rpc trigger detectors on the lhc alice experiment .
the outputs of each processing chain interface to a backplane , which itself interfaces to the fpga - based digital processing board .
the reprogrammability of the fpga allows different modes of operation to be accommodated without change of hardware .
the digital processor communicates via a usb 2.0 interface to a pc for fpga programming , software instrument control and data downlink .
the cad drawings in fig. 3 illustrate the three dimensional configuration of the electronics boards .
the detector ( an 18 mm version shown here ) is the black , stepped cylinder mounted on the detector headboard ( brown ) , its window facing outwards .
the detector headboard attaches via 4 edge connectors to four 64 channel pre - amplifier boards ( green ) , which in turn attach via impedance - matched connectors to the four tdc boards ( turquoise ) .
this integrated arrangement has been chosen to provide a design as compact as possible , in order to mount the system on a microscope in place of a typical ccd camera head .
4 electronics design and measurements the modular electronics are currently in varying states of readiness .
the nino32 chip has already been thoroughly bench tested and results published [ 5 ] , however the modular front - end board , which incorporates this in irpics is only just being manufactured .
the backend has progressed further .
the modular tdc board has been designed , manufactured and tested , and is shown in fig. 4. preliminary measurements of the channel to channel time jitter using an electronically generated test pulse are very promising ; a standard deviation of 21.54 ps has been measured and the data is shown in fig. 5. to put this figure in perspective , the time bin width in the hptdc asic " very high resolution " mode is 24.41 ps. fig. 5 is a photo of the modular tdc board .
the 64 channel nino front - end board interfaces via the front edge connector visible in the lower left hand corner .
this photo shows an alternative backplane design for a single tdc board ( available from photek as a standalone 64 channel tdc system ) .
the backplane also interfaces ( via the upper visible unpopulated connector ) with the fpga - based digital processing board. fig. 6 is a block diagram of the fpga controller board ( left ) , connected with one 64 channel tdc board ( right ) .
the remaining 3 tdc boards required for the 256 channel system have been omitted for clarity .
the altera fpga can be easily reconfigured to apply various application specific firmwares to suit the required mode of operation .
pre - processing in the fpga is used to provide data compression and analysis functionality upstream of the usb 2.0 pc interface , which is limited to - 200 mbit / s , and would otherwise constitute a data throughput bottleneck .
the on - board ram , shown in the diagram but not implemented in the initial build , will be added to later versions of the board to provide burst mode data acquisition at speeds limited only by the detector and pulse processing chain capabilities .
the fpga undertakes several tasks ; it configures the tdcs on boot - up , controls the data acquisition , and performs pre - processing on tdc data such as implementing inl correction , filtering out unnecessary data attributes , and converting data from an event stream to , say , a time - binned histogram , or as required .
for example in high throughput flim , when using the highly parallel multi - channel capability of the system to increase the conventional tcspc limit , the only valuable information is the time between laser pulse and fluorescence photon event .
for fcs , only the time between successive events need be measured .
in both cases knowledge of the channel id is not required .
in both cases , the fpga will be programmed to filter only the relevant data , which can then be transmitted to a data acquisition pc via the usb interface .
5 conclusions the irpics system , with its resolution of ~ 25 ps and up to 1024 channels read out in parallel at rates of up to 10 mcount / s , will exploit the state - of - the - art event timing potential of small pore microchannel plates .
it will offer unequaled combination of photon time resolution , channel density and event throughput , enabling measurements to be speeded up by orders of magnitude for applications such as fluorescence lifetime imaging .
the manufacture of the complete irpics system is close to completion .
however delays in manufacture of the detector and electronic boards mean we do not have a complete irpics system with which to demonstrate performance .
we have already achieved encouraging results with the 64 channel prototype detector [ 8 ] .
a best result of 78 ps rms photon timing resolution was measured using a pulsed laser , which included broadening due to 65 ps rms laser trigger jitter and 50 ps laser pulse width .
we expect the integrated irpics design to outperform the prototype whose performance was comprised due to a distributed electronics design .
initial electronic tests carried out on the modular tdc board supports this .
we have measured the time jitter between channels of the tdc board using an electronically generated signal at < 22 ps rms .
the 32x32 pixel2 mlc has been manufactured and we are currently attaching the detector interface flange , followed shortly by detector assembly .
the tdc board , backplane and fpga digital processing board have all been manufactured and tested .
all other electronic board pcbs have been designed and manufactured and are now being populated ready for test .
we expect full irpics system testing to begin in the first quarter of 2012 .

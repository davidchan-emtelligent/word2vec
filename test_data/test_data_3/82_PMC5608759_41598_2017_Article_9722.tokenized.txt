the glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) is essential for the stress response in mammals .
we investigated potential non - transcriptional roles of gr in cellular stress response using fission yeast as a model.we surprisingly discovered marked heat stress resistance in yeast ectopically expressing human gr , which required expression of both the n - terminal transactivation domain , and the c - terminal ligand binding domain , but not the dna - binding domain of the gr. this effect was not affected by gr ligand exposure , and occurred without significant gr nuclear accumulation .
mechanistically , the gr survival effect required hsp104 , and , indeed , gr expression increased hsp104 expression .
proteomic analysis revealed gr binding to translasome components , including eif3 , a known partner for sty1 , a pattern of protein interaction which we confirmed using yeast two - hybrid studies.taken together , we find evidence for a novel pathway conferring stress resistance in yeast that can be activated by the human gr , acting by protein - protein mechanisms in the cytoplasm .
this suggests that in organisms where gr is natively expressed , gr likely contributes to stress responses through non - transcriptional mechanisms in addition to its well - established transcriptional responses .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction the glucocorticoid receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily , an ancient class of intracellular receptors that has dwindled in number through evolution ( nursa ) 1 .
in mammals the gr is both integral to the stress response , and also to carbohydrate metabolism .
the gr is a ligand activated transcription factor , binding to target sites in the genome as a monomer , or dimer , and has both transactivation , and transrepression activity .
much attention has focussed on the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of gr action , but non - transcriptional roles have also been defined , including regulation of mitotic spindle function2 .
as natural selection in evolution can select for function , and not sequence , we ectopically expressed the human gr in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe ( s. pombe ) to test the hypothesis that non - genomic gr signalling is functionally conserved through evolution .
the fission yeast s. pombe is a useful model for studying stress response , with conservation of most of the stress - responsive signalling pathways in a single cell organism .
in addition s. pombe is highly tractable to genetic manipulation .
in the past most studies of gr in yeast have used s. cerevisiae , in which ectopic gr was shown to be capable of transactivating a transgenic reporter gene3 .
the fission yeast s. pombe is evolutionarily divergent from s. cerevisiae 4,5 ; in particular the stress - activated map kinase pathway is far closer to the mammalian orthologue than is the s. cerevisiae 6 , and gr can serve as an active transcription factor in s. pombe if expressed with an appropriate reporter gene , indicating that the gr can be expressed , and retains function7 .
accordingly , we sought to identify a non - genomic signalling role for the gr when expressed ectopically in s. pombe .
we found that ectopic gr conferred heat shock resistant to the s. pombe , through a cytoplasmic , non - genomic mechanism .
furthermore , we identified an unexpected role for the translasome8,9 , with gr interacting with key components in the cytoplasm .
results expression human gralpha in s. pombe cells and identification of a stress tolerant phenotype the human gralpha was expressed in yeast cells , revealing a single protein species ( fig. 1a,b ) .
surprisingly , ectopic expression of human gralpha conferred a major stress resistant phenotype to the yeast ( fig. 1c ) .
to investigate which gr domain was responsible for conferring this effect a series of deletent gr molecules were expressed in yeast ( fig. 1a,b,c ) .
the deletion mutants conferred variable resistance to thermal stress , with deletion of either the n or the c terminal domains rendering the gr ineffective .
however , deletion of the dna binding domain , required to transmit glucocorticoid signals to target gene enhancers , did not affect thermoprotection ( fig. 1c ) .
isolated n or c terminal domains alone were insufficient to replicate the protective phenotype ( fig. 1c ) .
this suggests a composite protein surface comprising the two terminal domains in complex is required to signal thermoprotection ( fig. 1d ) .
although the possibility that wt gr actively regulates genes in s. pombe cannot be formally ruled out , the ability of gr variants lacking the dna binding domain to induce thermoprotection argues that the effect is unlikely to involve direct transcriptional responses .

localisation gralpha in yeast cells to investigate the localisation , and trafficking , of gralpha an n - terminal gfp tag was used .
first of all , we checked expression of the gr - fusion proteins under basal and thermostress conditions ( fig. 2a ) .
human gralpha was predominantly cytoplasmic even in the presence of dexamethasone ( fig. 2b2,b4 ) .
thermostress resistance was not affected by ligand activation ( fig. 2c4 ) , in keeping with a lack of nuclear translocation seen with the ligand ( fig. 2b2,4 ) .
however , we did observe the accumulation of gralpha protein in solid assemblies , likely stress granules ( sg ) , in response to heat shock ( fig. 2b3,4 ) .

identification of a protein - protein interaction mechanism conferring stress resistance our identification of a stress - responsive pathway activated by gralpha suggested a nongenomic , protein - protein interaction mechanism of action .
this was strengthened by the lack of nuclear gralpha in either the absence or presence of ligand .
to investigate further , we purified gralpha - containing complexes using a gralpha antibody approach , and subjected the material derived to tandem mass spectroscopy for protein identification .
we analysed gralpha complexes at both permissive 30 degreesc , and stress temperatures 39 degreesc ( fig. 3a ) .
in total 294 proteins common to both temperatures were identified ( supplementary table s1 ) .
a gene set analysis using angeli10 shows cytoplasmic protein translation as the most significantly enriched go biological process ( 33 % among these proteins compared to 5 % in the background consisting of all protein - coding genes ; q - val = 4.06e - 58 ) and cytosol as top localisation ( 36 % as compared to 12 % for background ; q - val = 4.07e - 25 ) ( see the supplementary table s2 ) .

the protein id , description , and human orthologues are listed .
computational analysis of gr interactome in order to analyse these gr interactome data more comprehensively , we developed a computational pipeline which takes as input our gralpha - specific interactome and integrates it with the published literature on protein - protein interactions in fission yeast as well as publicly available data on eukaryotic domain - domain interactions in order to predict both direct and indirect binding partners of gralpha in s. pombe ( see material and methods ). from the gralpha protein interactome ( common set of proteins for gralpha at 30 degreesc and at gralpha 39 degreesc supplementary table s1 ) we predict 16 direct interactions , i.e. , proteins purified with gralpha , and having functional domains known to form direct interactions with characterised gralpha domains .
these direct interacting proteins include hsp90 , and hsp104 , among others , and are shown in table 1 .
the gr : hsp90 interaction in particular has previously been very well characterised16 .
again from the gralpha interactome we predict interacting protein pairs where an identified gralpha interactor may require a " bridge " protein to explain its presence in the purified complex .
these include ras1 , sty1 , and hsp70 ( fig. 5b ) .
all these 570 predictions and their human orthologues , if available , are given in supplementary table ( supplementary table s4 ) .
figure 5 ( a ) summary diagram indicates the likely site of gr action , lying within a multiprotein complex in the yeast cytoplasm in molecular proximity to the protein synthesis initiation translation factor eif3 , ubiquitin polymerase 26s and ribosomal proteins8,9 .
( b ) network visualization of the core gr induced stress response network in s. pombe , including direct interactions of gralpha with s. pombe proteins ( in the co - precipitation list ) , as well as indirect interactions of gralpha via other ' bridge ' proteins ( inferred using computational approaches from the co - precipitation list ) .
interaction of gr with eif3 and proteasome 26s we selected three from the sixteen genes predicted to make direct contacts with the gr ( table 1 ) for further analysis .
we chose two core subunits of eif3 : eif3a , eif3c and one of the 19 s proteasome regulatory subunits , mts4 .
these were selected based on their presence within the supercomplex translasome that controls protein synthesis and degradation8,9 , and likely involvement in the stress granule accumulation of the gr observed under conditions of heat stress .
in order to prove interaction between gr and these proteins we used an s. pombe two hybrid system17 , using protocols adapted from s. cerevisiae 18 .
the gene encoding human gr were fused to the gal4 - activation domain in two - hybrid experiments designed to examine interactions between the genes encoding eif3a , eif3c and mts4 were fused to the binding domain of gal4 .
as a positive control we used the well - characterised interaction between hsp90 and the gr16 , but here we used the s. pombe hsp90 .
the yeast two - hybrid system revealed that the hgr interacted with all three selected proteins in a robust and ligand - independent manner .
the absence of any signal with incomplete hybrid components proves the highly specific nature of these protein interactions ( fig. 3ca ) .
we checked a number of negative controls including : interaction between the empty pgadt7 and pgbkt7 containing dna of hsp90 , eif3a,eif3c and mts4 genes and interaction between empty pgbkt7 and pgadt7 containing dna full length human gralpha .
all these controls were negative ( fig. 3cb ) .
localisation of gr in polysome gradient the discovery of gr interaction with components of the protein translasome raised the intriguing possibility that the actions of gr were mediated by direct contacts within that macromolecular complex .
in addition to visualising the gr within stress granules , and both finding , and confirming , gr interactions with the eif3 complex we sought enrichment of the gr within the yeast cell polyribosome fractions .
accordingly , yeast lysates were fractionated through a sucrose gradient , and the fractions analysed for the presence of gr. these studies showed gr emerging in the 40s monomeric ribosome fraction , as well as in the polysome fraction associated with efficient protein translation ( fig. 3d ) .
the eif3 complex was previously shown to separate in the same 40s ribosomal fraction19 .
the role of heat shock protein 104 in mediating gr stress resistance we proposed the existence of a thermoprotection cascade initiated by the cytoplasmic gr , and resulting in increased expression / activity of a heat - shock protein response , such as the heat shock protein 104 ( hsp104 ) .
therefore , we employed a simple hsp104 thermotolerance assay20,21 .
as shown in fig. 4a , human gralpha did not affect growth at 30 degreesc .
wt cells do not survive a heat shock of 50 degreesc for 20 minutes , but pre - treatment at 37 degreesc for 1 hour before lethal temperature shock resulted in acquired thermotolerance .
in contrast , cells expressing human gralpha survived a heat shock of 20 minutes at 50 degreesc in the same way as those cells subjected to pre - treatment at 37 degreesc for 1 hour .
the thermotolerant phenotype conferred by gralpha suggested augmented expression of proteins for thermotolerance , such as the gralpha interactor hsp104 .
indeed , there was a highly significant increase in hsp104 gene expression seen with ectopic gralpha , both at 30 degreesc , and at 39 degreesc ( fig. 4b ) .
the thermotolerant phenotype was unaffected by ligand activation ( fig. 4a ) and , as above , there was no nuclear translocation seen of activated gralpha in the s. pombe cells ( figs 2b2 and 4 ) .
to investigate the requirement of hsp104 for the gralpha thermotolerant effect we used a yeast strain null for the hsp104 gene22 .
loss of hsp104 completely prevented the gralpha survival effect ( fig. 4c ) .
therefore , hsp104 is required to mediate the thermoresistant phenotype seen with ectopic gr expression , and both under permissive and thermal stress conditions gr expression induce hsp104 expression , suggesting that a signalling pathway must connect the cytoplasmic gr with hsp104 induction .
one potential explanation for this is protein misfolding of the gr23 - 25 .
gr induction of hsp104 may in part be a response to demands placed on the heat shock protein system .
this does not appear to be due to overt aggregation of gr ( fig. 4d ) .
however , formation of functional gr complexes is known to involve assembly with chaperone proteins .
gr overexpression could thus elicit a compensatory upregulation of the hsp machinery , including hsp104 .
gralpha activates stress kinase signalling in s. pombe hsp104 gene expression is activated by sty1 kinase26 .
therefore , we proposed that ectopic gralpha activated sty1 , to initiate a signalling cascade leading to hsp104 expression , so resulting in thermoprotection .
analysis of sty1 protein revealed no change in expression , but there was a clear increase in sty1 phosphorylation , and therefore activation , in gralpha expressing yeast ( fig. 4e ) .
to investigate the requirement for sty1 in the phenotype we analysed sty1 null yeast strain jp198 ( see material and methods ) .
this yeast grows slowly and all were killed by heat shock , with or without ectopic gralpha expression ( fig. 4f ) .
the lack of thermoprotection seen with gralpha suggests a critical role for sty1 in the mechanism of gralpha action .
in pursuit of a mechanism linking hgr to sty1 activation we noted that eif3a27 , a known partner of sty1 , and a newly discovered interacting protein with hgr suggested co - location of all three proteins in a cytoplasmic complex , such as the stress granule ( table 1 and fig. 2b ) .
now , sty1 can be activated by either of two pathways : wak1 or win1 / wis1 / sty16 and ras1 / byr2 / zfs1 / sty1 ( fig. 3f ) 28,29 .
we further interrogated the 294 gr co - precipitated proteins ( supplementary table s1 ) .
we discovered a clear enrichment of ras1 , byr2 , zfs1 and mra1 as well as sty1 as present in complex with the hgr ( table 2 ) .
this suggests gr engagement with a coherent ras1 / byr2 / sty1 activation pathway within the cytoplasmic translasome , and stress granule to result in sty1 activation , and thereby transcriptional activation of hsp104 , and thermoprotection ( fig. 4g ) .

discussion nuclear receptors are an ancient family of ligand regulated transcription factors .
their functions have changed through evolution , with the development of sophisticated endocrine signalling cascades feeding into ligand activation of some members , such as the glucocorticoid receptor .
indeed , sophisticated evolutionary biology approaches have delineated the evolution of specific corticosteroid binding through evolution30 .
however , there are inconsistencies in the literature , with some functions ascribed to non - transcriptional mechanisms31 - 35 .
to investigate these non - conventional mechanisms of glucocorticoid action a tractable model system lacking nuclear gralpha was required .
we discovered that s. pombe supported gralpha expression , but not gralpha nuclear translocation , thereby offering such a system .
in our initial studies we identified acquisition of a striking heat stress resistant phenotype resulting from ectopic gralpha expression in s. pombe , a discovery which prompted further study .
human gralpha was expressed in s. pombe , but there was no detectable nuclear translocation in response to ligand addition .
furthermore , the heat shock resistance was unaffected by incubation with potent gralpha ligands , again suggesting a non - transcription mechanism of action .
as s. pombe and human genomes are evolutionarily divergent conservation of stress regulatory function in both systems by the human gralpha is very surprising , and suggests a degree of functional conservation , possibly through preserved protein - protein interactions .
the human gralpha interactome in s. pombe revealed significant enrichment in chaperone proteins , orthologues of the human heat shock protein partners for gralpha .
this observation offered a potential explanation for the acquisition of heat shock resistance in the s. pombe cells , and indeed we proved the requirement of hsp104 for mediating ectopic gralpha effects .
we observed gralpha within cytoplasmic sgs under heat shock in s. pombe cells , and analysis of gralpha co - precipitated proteins identified the translation initiation components ( eif3a and eif3c ; both direct domain interaction ) , and the prion - like protein hsp104 ( direct domain interaction ). s. pombe sgs have previously been shown to contain components of the protein translation machinery including eif3 , eif2 , eif4g , eif4a and poly ( a ) - binding protein , 40 s ribosomal subunits13 , suggesting that the gr is at least in part located within stress granules , under heat shock .
indeed , we also identify these translated proteins in complex with gr when recovered from heat - shocked yeast , along with well - characterised gr protein chaperones13 - 15 .
the identification of gralpha in sg suggests localisation gr together with translation machinery , a novel mechanism for the nongenomic action in cellular stress response .
interestingly , it was recently shown that the key circadian transcription factor bmal1 also associates with and regulates the translation machinery , conferring a circadian rhythmicity to protein translation36 , and another example of a transcription factor acting on translation .
our interactome studies revealed both direct and indirect gr partners , and inferred the presence of stress - signalling kinases including sty1 , the s. pombe orthologue of sapk6,37,38 .
this prompted us to test the functional role of sty1 in the gr phenotype , and indeed we were able to show that sty1 is required to confer a heat resistant cellular phenotype .
as we find multiple sty1 substrate proteins , along with substrates for upstream sty1 activating kinases , within the gr interactome this suggests the presence of gr within a multi protein complex .
this complex includes components of the translasome , within stress granules , where gr can act to activate sty1 , and thereby the expression of hsp104 to result in thermoresistant yeast .
the identification of a cytoplasmic gr mechanism of action in the yeast , which operates through yeast proteins with recognised mammalian orthologues , has major implications for understanding gr action .
it is striking that the functional conservation of stress protection from s. pombe to mammals operates through a cytoplasmic protein - protein interaction mechanism , and not through direct engagement of the ligand - activated gr with high - affinity genomic binding sites .
this discovery offers , for the first time , a coherent explanation for why in mammalian cells the gr occupies a distinct cytoplasmic location in the absence of ligand .
this distribution is not seen even with quite closely related steroid receptors , such as the oestrogen receptor .
early explanations suggested that sequestration of quiescent gr away from its binding sites in the genome is important , but if so why does the mechanism not apply more widely across the nuclear receptor superfamily ?
it is more likely that the cytoplasmic anchoring of gr permits protein - protein interactions to drive non - genomic downstream pathways , as demonstrated in s. pombe .
however , in mammalian cells distinguishing transcriptional from non - transcriptional mechanisms of gr action has proved more difficult .
we now identify not only an important stress - resistant phenotype , but also map a coherent non - nuclear mechanism of gr action .

computational analysis and expansion of gr - induced interactome in s. pombe given there is no existing data on gralpha interactions with fission yeast proteins , we develop a computational pipeline , to predict potential direct and indirect binding partners of gralpha in s. pombe .
this is depicted as a diagram in fig. 3b .
given the input list of proteins ( common set of proteins from the precipitation lists at both temperatures ) , our pipeline works in two ways : ( a ) direct interactions : we assign domains ( pfam44 ) to the input proteins and using public data on eukaryotic domain - domain interactions ( dima45 ) , we predict direct interactors of gralpha , i.e. , proteins which have domains which are known to interact with gralpha domains .
( b ) indirect interactions : as there are very few direct interactions , and keeping in mind the effect of potential false positive and false negatives in our experimental data as well as in the public data on protein and domain interactions , we look for potential indirect interactions of input proteins with gralpha via other proteins .
this is done in two steps given below : ( b.1 ) we expand the interactome , using the above list as query to literature ppi resources for s. pombe , i.e , biogrid46,47 and pint48,49 , keeping only the direct interactions of the proteins in the input list .
( b.2 ) assign the pfam domains10 to the ppis from ( b.1 ) .
dima is a public resource , which includes experimental as well as computational predictions of domain interactions. from the subset of ppis in ( b.1 ) , we extract those protein pairs , which have at least one domain , which is predicted ( in dima ) to interact with gralpha domains .

abnormal accumulation of protein inclusions in motor neurons has been known as a major pathological change in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) .
increasing numbers of proteins including mutant cu , zn - superoxide dismutase ( sod1 ) have been identified as constituents of pathological inclusions in a form of insoluble fibrillar aggregates .
notably , protein fibrillar aggregates exhibit a self - perpetuating property , which can convert a soluble native protein into insoluble fibrillar aggregates .
such " seeding reaction " of protein fibrils can accelerate the aggregation significantly and would contribute to the spread of inclusion pathologies from an affected cell to its neighboring cells in neurodegenerative diseases .
in als , a pathological change first occurs at the site of disease onset and then propagates throughout the affected tissues in a time - dependent manner ; therefore , it can be assumed that seeded aggregation may be the key factor of disease progression in als .
in this mini review , we will briefly summarize recent studies on possible roles of a seeded aggregation of sod1 in pathomechanism of als .
sod1 aggregation seeding reaction protein misfolding amyloid introduction many proteins gain physiological functions by folding into their own unique three - dimensional structures , and any disturbance during this folding process potentially disrupts protein functions , which is considered to cause a variety of diseases ( morimoto , 2008 ) .
among those , neurodegenerative diseases have been well characterized by abnormal accumulation of " mis " - folded proteins in brains and spinal cords of patients ( soto , 2003 ; ross and poirier , 2004 ) .
more specifically , certain misfolded proteins form insoluble , fibrillar aggregates that are rich in beta - sheet structures , widely known as amyloid ( nelson et al. , 2005 ) .
in many neurodegenerative diseases , neurological symptoms appear in middle age ( 50 years ~) , suggesting that it is a rare event for proteins to become misfolded / aggregated .
in fact , protein fibrillar aggregation in vitro requires a significant conformational conversion of proteins to form oligomers ( also known as " nucleus ") , which is a rate - limiting step of the overall aggregation reaction ( harper and lansbury , 1997 ) .
once the nucleus forms , however , it functions as a structural template ( or so called " seed ") to convert native proteins into beta - sheet - rich structures and then elongate the protein fibril .
this mechanism , which accelerates and even triggers protein aggregation , is called the seeding reaction .
while it remains controversial whether protein aggregation is the direct cause or a mere result of neurodegeneration ( winklhofer et al. , 2008 ; treusch et al. , 2009 ) , this seeding mechanism may explain why many neurodegenerative diseases progress rapidly after the symptoms first appear .
one notable example for a seeding reaction is the infectivity of prion diseases , in which the spread of fibrillar aggregates of prion proteins is considered to be the main cause of neurodegeneration ( prusiner , 1982 ; aguzzi and rajendran , 2009 ) .
fibrils of prion proteins are considered to work as infectious agents that can be transmitted between individuals .
as exemplified in kuru ( gibbs et al. , 1980 ) , eating affected tissues of the disease could introduce fibrillar prion aggregates into a brain of a healthy control as seeds and thereby trigger fibrillation of prion proteins and cause neurodegeneration .
while no infectivity between individuals has been reported in neurodegenerative diseases besides prion diseases so far , a seeding phenomenon appears to be common to protein fibrillar aggregates ( dobson , 1999 ) ; therefore , increasing numbers of researchers have pursued possible roles of seeding reactions in pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases ( aguzzi and rajendran , 2009 ; polymenidou and cleveland , 2011 ; soto , 2012 ) .
for example , alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is characterized by fibrillar aggregation of abeta peptides in brains ( hardy and selkoe , 2002 ) , and accelerated accumulation of abeta fibrils has been confirmed in primate and rodent models that are injected with brain homogenates of an ad patient ( meyer - luehmann et al. , 2006 ; ridley et al. , 2006 ) .
several other pathogenic proteins also forms fibrillar aggregates in vitro , which have been tested for their in vivo seeding activity by being transduced into cultured cells and brains of transgenic mouse model ( aguzzi and rajendran , 2009 ; polymenidou and cleveland , 2011 ; soto , 2012 ) .
a seeding reaction of protein fibrils is thus considered to play important roles in pathological progression of neurodegenerative diseases , and in this mini review , we will focus upon roles of seeded aggregation of proteins in pathologies of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) .
a seeded fibrillation of superoxide dismutase ( sod1 ) as a pathological propagation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) als is a devastating motor neuron disease , mainly caused by abnormal accumulation of inclusions in the spinal cord ( bruijn et al. , 2004 ) .
notably , als has been known to occur as a focal process , which spreads contiguously throughout upper and lower motor neurons ( ravits and la spada , 2009 ; holmes and diamond , 2012 ; kanouchi et al. , 2012 ) .
in other words , motor neuron degeneration in als is an orderly and actively propagating process , which appears to share characteristics of a seeded aggregation of proteins seen in prion diseases .
most als cases (~ 90 %) are sporadic with no known genetic factors ( sporadic als , sals ) , while the remaining cases have been known to exhibit a family history ( familial als , fals ; robberecht and philips , 2013 ) .
in 1993 , dominant mutations in the gene encoding cu , zn - superoxide dismutase ( sod1 ) were identified as one of major genetic causes of fals ( rosen et al. , 1993 ) , and mutant sod1 proteins have been known to accumulate abnormally in the form of insoluble inclusions within affected spinal motor neurons of sod1 - related fals patients ( bruijn et al. , 1998 ) .
ultrastructural analysis of sod1 - positive inclusions in fals cases has identified their fibrillar morphologies ( kato et al. , 2000 ) ; however , those inclusions were not stained by amyloid - diagnostic dye , thioflavin s , which has made it controversial whether fibrillar aggregates of mutant sod1 in vivo are rich in beta - sheets ( kerman et al. , 2010 ) .
moreover , sod1 - positive inclusions have never been isolated from fals cases , so further biochemical tests will be required to characterize pathological sod1 aggregates .
in contrast , sod1 - positive inclusions with als - like symptoms were reproduced in a fals - model mouse expressing human sod1 with a pathogenic mutation ( turner and talbot , 2008 ) and were found to be stained by thioflavin s , supporting the formation of amyloid - like , beta - sheet - rich fibrils in mouse ( wang et al. , 2002 ; furukawa et al. , 2008 ) .
insoluble sod1 aggregates were also successfully isolated from the spinal cords of affected fals - model mice , and quite notably , those sod1 aggregates exhibited seeding activity toward fibrillation of purified sod1 proteins in vitro .
chia et al. have prepared homogenates of spinal cords of transgenic mice expressing human sod1 with g93a mutation and shown that the homogenates triggered fibrillation of wild - type as well as g93a - mutant human sod1 proteins under in vitro conditions with acidic ph of solution in the presence of a chaotropic reagent , guanidine hydrochloride ( chia et al. , 2010 ) .
while destabilization of sod1 proteins under artificial conditions appears to be required for a seeded acceleration of fibrillar aggregation , inclusions containing mutant sod1 would function as seeds and thereby contribute to propagation of pathological changes among contiguous motor neurons and then disease progression of sod1 - related fals cases .
fibrillogenic propensities of sod1 proteins have been well characterized in in vitro studies using purified recombinant proteins .
sod1 is a cytoplasmic enzyme ( chang et al. , 1988 ) that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen ( mccord and fridovich , 1969 ) and is activated by binding of a catalytic copper and a structural zinc ion and also by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond ( furukawa et al. , 2004 ) .
wild - type holo - sod1 with a disulfide bond exhibits high thermostability ( tm 90degreesc ) , conferring significant resistance to structural changes and aggregation ( forman and fridovich , 1973 ) .
in contrast , when sod1 lacks both metal ions and a disulfide bond ( apo - sod1sh ) , its melting temperature decreases down to 43degreesc and become more prone to misfolding and aggregation at physiological temperature ( furukawa and o'halloran , 2005 ) .
in vitro aggregates of human sod1 polypeptide without any modifications possess amyloid - like characters with fibrillar morphologies and show a seeding activity to accelerate fibrillation of native human sod1 proteins ( furukawa et al. , 2008 ) .
more importantly , amyloid - like fibrils of human apo - sod1sh retain their seeding activity in the intracellular environment ; transduction of those human sod1 fibrils into cultured cells ( mouse neuroblastoma , neuro2a ) has been shown to trigger the aggregation of stably - transfected human sod1 ( furukawa et al. , 2013 ) .
fals - causing mutations have been shown to decrease affinity for copper / zinc ions and / or stability of a disulfide bond ( hayward et al. , 2002 ; tiwari and hayward , 2003 ; furukawa et al. , 2008 ) .
therefore , in a reducing environment of the cytoplasm with high metal - chelating capacity , pathogenic mutations are supposed to increase intracellular fractions of fibrillation - prone apo - sod1sh ( furukawa et al. , 2008 ) .
nonetheless , it remains unclear how mutant sod1 forms aggregates under pathological conditions .
to elucidate how sod1 aggregates form , several pathways for aggregation have been proposed in sod1 proteins in vitro ( furukawa , 2012b ) .
as reported by munch et al. mutant sod1 was found to form fibrillo - granular aggregates by addition of trifluoroethanol ( tfe ; munch and bertolotti , 2010 ) , which penetrated inside neuronal cells through macropinocytosis and then acted as seeds to trigger intracellular aggregation of endogenously expressed sod1 variants ( munch et al. , 2011 ) .
once sod1 aggregation occurs in a cell , the aggregates can be released to the extracellular space and then transferred from cell to cell ( vide infra ) .
intracellular aggregation of mutant sod1 is thus considered to be persistent and heritable after passages , supporting prion - like propagation of aggregation phenotypes .
as mentioned above , two distinct types of sod1 aggregates , i.e. , apo - sod1sh amyloids and tfe - induced aggregates , have been found to function as seeds to trigger sod1 aggregation intracellularly , but their structural and biochemical properties depend on how aggregation was induced ( furukawa et al. , 2008 ; munch and bertolotti , 2010 ) .
based upon previous in vitro studies , several distinct pathways for aggregation are possible in sod1 ( toichi et al. , 2013 ) and are expected to produce sod1 aggregates with a varying degree of a seeding activity .
this might describe heterologous progression and severity of diseases among sod1 - related fals patients .
indeed , disease phenotypes of fals cases have been known to be variable among different mutations in sod1 ( wang et al. , 2008 ) , and furthermore , mutation - dependent structures of sod1 fibrils closely correlate with their distinct biochemical properties ( furukawa et al. , 2010 ) .
therefore , it will be interesting to test if sod1 fibrils with different mutations exhibit distinct activity as seeds in vitro and in vivo .
propagation of protein misfolding in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) in a seeding reaction , sheared pieces of insoluble fibrils can act as structural templates for a " phase - like transition " from soluble native conformers to generally insoluble fibrillar state , but this view now appears to be necessary for revision .
grad et al. utilized antibodies ( 3h1 and 10c12 ) that exclusively recognize misfolded sod1 with disease - specific epitopes , which are not available in the natively folded state , and showed that misfolding of endogenous wild - type sod1 in human cells ( e.g. , human embryonic kidney 293 cells ( hek293 )) is induced by co - expression of a soluble misfolded form of human sod1 with pathogenic mutations ( grad et al. , 2011 ) .
in other words , soluble misfolded conformers of sod1 are also transmissible without adopting classical , insoluble fibrillar states .
furthermore , transient expression of mutant human sod1 in murine cells ( e.g. , neuro2a ) did not induce misfolding of endogenous mouse wild - type sod1 ( grad et al. , 2011 ) .
the difference lies in the amino acid sequence of murine and human sod1 , where the only tryptophan in human sod1 ( trp32 ) is replaced by serine in murine counterpart .
indeed , misfolding of wild - type human sod1 was observed by human sod1 with a pathogenic ( g127x ) mutation but was significantly mitigated when g127x human sod1 with w32s mutation was used ( grad et al. , 2011 ) .
trp32 in human sod1 is highly solvent - exposed and distant from the native dimer interface , which might provide an alternative site for abnormal intermolecular interactions through hydrophobic interactions .
it is interesting to note that expression of mutant tar dna binding protein 43 ( tdp - 43 ) and fused in sarcoma ( fus ) , pathogenic proteins also known to be found in als patients ( arai et al. , 2006 ; neumann et al. , 2006 ; kwiatkowski et al. , 2009 ; vance et al. , 2009 ) , can increase the immunoreactivity for misfolded sod1 using a disease - specific antibody ( 3h1 ) , both in patients and cultured human cells ( sh - sy5y ; pokrishevsky et al. , 2012 ) .
while pathological involvement of wild - type sod1 in als remains to be established , aberrant conformers of wild - type sod1 have been reported in sporadic als with no genetic background ( furukawa , 2012a ) .
accordingly , toxic conformers of sod1 might be produced by abnormal interactions of folded sod1 with misfolded sod1 or other proteins ( such as tdp - 43 / fus ) at the site surrounding trp32 .
in other words , as proposed in the template - assisted misfolding of prion proteins ( horwich and weissman , 1997 ) , soluble but misfolded conformers of protein molecules can be propagated through abnormal interactions among homologous proteins even without the formation of classical amyloid - like fibrils .
a cell - to - cell transfer of intracellular superoxide dismutase ( sod1 ) sod1 is known as one of major intracellular proteins , and most of sod1 (~ 70 %) exist in the cytoplasm ( chang et al. , 1988 ) .
to confirm that seeded aggregation or misfolding of sod1 is the key molecular mechanism of pathological propagation of sod1 - fals , it is required to understand how intracellular misfolded / aggregated sod1 is transferred from the cytoplasm to extracellular environment .
as a relatively simple process , misfolded / aggregated sod1 would be released to extracellular environment by death of an affected cell and then phagocytosed by the other cell .
recent studies have nonetheless suggested more sophisticated processes for a cell - to - cell transfer of sod1 proteins ( grad et al. , 2011 ; munch et al. , 2011 ) .
in fact , active secretion of sod1 to extracellular space has been suggested in several different types of cultured cells ( mondola et al. , 1996 , 1998 ) , and both wild - type and mutant sod1 can be also detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy controls as well as fals patients ( zetterstrom et al. , 2011 ) .
in conditioned media of mouse motor neuron - like hybrid ( nsc - 34 ) cell line , impaired secretion of mutant sod1 was associated with intracellular formation of inclusions and toxicity , suggesting secretion of mutant sod1 as a beneficial process for cell survival ( turner et al. , 2005 ) .
in contrast , urushitani et al. have found that mutant sod1 proteins are secreted in association with chromogranins and cause microgliosis and neuron death ( urushitani et al. , 2006 ) , leading to the idea that suppression of extracellular mutant sod1 is a promising strategy for therapeutics of sod1 - related fals cases .
indeed , passive as well as active immunizations targeting extracellular mutant sod1 proteins have successfully prolonged lifespan of transgenic mice expressing mutant human sod1 ( urushitani et al. , 2007 ) .
toxic roles of secreted sod1 are further supported by the findings that motor neurons are killed by being co - cultured with astrocytes derived from adult neural progenitor cells isolated from post - mortem lumber spinal cord tissues from sporadic als as well as sod1 - related fals ( haidet - phillips et al. , 2011 ) .
also importantly , suppression of sod1 in both fals and sporadic als astrocytes was found to negate such toxicity of astrocytes toward motor neurons .
recently , furthermore , basso et al. have shown the increased release of exosomes from astrocytes overexpressing fals - causing mutant sod1 and found that astrocyte - derived exosomes contained mutant sod1 proteins and were transferred to the cytoplasm of spinal neurons ( basso et al. , 2013 ) .
based upon these results , secretion of sod1 is considered to occur through several distinct pathways and appears to be a normal physiological process .
experimental evidences are further required to show that secretory vesicles act as a messenger to generate seeding activity of sod1 .
more specifically , conformational analysis of sod1 ( folded , misfolded , or fibrillized ) included in those vesicles will reveal the molecular mechanism of pathological propagation in als through a seeding reaction .
summary as briefly summarized above , increasing numbers of recent studies have supported the idea that misfolding / aggregation of mutant sod1 is transmissible through a seeding mechanism inside the cell and among cells .
in that sense , it is interesting to test pathological roles , if any , of sod3 , which resides at the extracellular matrix and possesses a structural domain almost homologous to sod1 ( folz and crapo , 1994 ) .
a sod1 - like domain of sod3 has been shown to exhibit propensities for aggregation ( son et al. , 2003 ) , implying its involvement in the formation of seeds that can be taken up by cells .
in summary , a seeded aggregation of sod1 proteins including wild - type sod1 will be a key event to understand progression / propagation of pathological changes in sod1 - related fals and even sals cases without mutations in sod1 , and extracellular sod1 with aberrant conformations is a promising target for therapeutics of those devastating diseases .

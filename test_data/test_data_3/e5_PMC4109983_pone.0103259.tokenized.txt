the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma ( cca ) is often challenging , leading to poor prognosis .
cca arises via chronic inflammation which may be associated with autoantibodies production .
this study aims to identify igg antibodies directed at self - proteins and tumor - associated antigens .
proteins derived from immortalized cholangiocyte cell line ( mmnk1 ) and cca cell lines ( m055 , m214 and m139 ) were separated using 2 - dimensional electrophoresis and incubated with pooled plasma of patients with cca and non - neoplastic controls by immunoblotting .
twenty five immunoreactive spots against all cell lines - derived proteins were observed on stained gels and studied by lc - ms / ms. among these , heat shock protein 70 ( hsp70 ) , enolase 1 ( eno1 ) and ribonuclease / angiogenin inhibitor 1 ( rnh1 ) obtained the highest matching scores and were thus selected for further validation .
western blot revealed immunoreactivity against hsp70 and rnh1 in the majority of cca cases and weakly in healthy individuals .
further , elisa showed that plasma hsp70 autoantibody level in cca was significantly capable to discriminate cca from healthy individuals with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9158 ( cut - off 0.2630 , 93.55 % sensitivity and 73.91 % specificity ) .
plasma levels of igg autoantibodies against hsp70 were correlated with progression from healthy individuals to cholangitis to cca ( r = 0.679 , p < 0.001 ) .
in addition , circulating eno1 and rnh1 autoantibodies levels were also significantly higher in cholangitis and cca compared to healthy controls ( p < 0.05 ) .
moreover , the combinations of hsp70 , eno1 or rnh1 autoantibodies positivity rates improved specificity to over 78 % .
in conclusion , plasma igg autoantibodies against hsp70 , eno1 and rnh1 may represent new diagnostic markers for cca .

introduction cholangiocarcinoma ( cca ) is an adenocarcinoma originating from bile duct epithelial cells with highest incidence rates in northeastern thailand [ 1 ] .
in this area , cca is associated with the liver fluke , opisthorchis viverrini infection through chronic inflammation of the bile ducts [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] via reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] and reactivity against the infection [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
ultrasonography currently represents the most sensitive tool for hepatobiliary cancer detection but this is often difficult to discriminate from cholangitis [ 8 ] and , as a result , diagnosis is frequently delayed with dramatic effects on the outcome [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) and carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 ( ca 19 - 9 ) are commonly used when cca is suspected but their sensitivity and specificity are widely variable [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] and , as a result , there is an urgent need for new noninvasive biomarkers .
autoantibodies against self - or tumor - associated antigens ( taas ) represent promising cancer biomarkers [ 14 ] - [ 18 ] .
in several cases , autoantibodies correlate with disease stage [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] and persist longer and at higher levels than the targeted protein [ 22 ] .
mechanisms underlying the production of autoantibodies against the bile ducts remain enigmatic [ 23 ] , possibly relying on the link with chronic inflammation [ 24 ] with oxidative stress causing the appearance of neoepitopes [ 25 ] .
moreover , it is now largely established that immune response to taas may be affected by many mechanisms including mutated [ 26 ] , misfolded [ 27 ] , overexpressed [ 28 ] , aberrantly degraded [ 29 ] , glycosylated [ 30 ] and ectopically expressed [ 31 ] tumor proteins .
based on these observations , we sought for plasma autoantibodies in patients with fluke - associated cca and identified immunoreactivity against heat shock protein 70 ( hsp70 ) , enolase 1 ( eno1 ) and ribonuclease / angiogenin inhibitor 1 ( rnh1 ) proteins as potential biomarkers for cca .
methods subjects plasma samples were obtained from 66 subjects and divided into 3 groups including healthy controls ( n = 23 , 17 healthy subjects and 6 abnormal blood vessels subjects without hepatobiliary tract abnormality , mean age 53.4 +/ - 8 years ) , patients with cholangitis ( bacterial cholangitis and cholelithiasis , n = 12 , mean age 58.7 +/ - 10 years ) and cca ( of tubular and papillary types , n = 31 , mean age 56 +/ - 9 years ) .
ten ml of peripheral blood were obtained by sterile venipuncture and collected in tubes containing edta .

anti - hsp70 , eno1 and rnh1 autoantibodies levels could be distinguished between healthy controls and cholangitis ( p < 0.01 , auc = 0.8170 , 0.8043 and 0.7790 , respectively ) .
the sensitivity and specificity rates of anti - hsp70 were 75 % and 73.91 % , of anti - eno1 75 % and 78.26 % and of anti - rnh1 83.33 % and 65.22 % , respectively ( table 5 ) .
in addition , to discriminate between cholangitis and cca the sensitivity and specificity of anti - hsp70 were 51.61 % and 83.33 % , respectively ( p < 0.05 , auc = 0.7191 ) .
the discriminating power of the possible combinations of different reactivities of autoantibodies ( i.e. hsp70 and eno1 , hsp70 and rnh1 , eno1 and rnh1 , hsp70 and eno1 and rnh1 ) was analyzed ( table 6 ) and the specificity exceeded 78 % when compared to a single marker ( table 5 ) with only a slight reduction in sensitivity .

clinical correlation of hsp70 , eno1 and rnh1 autoantibodies the correlation between hsp70 , rnh1 and eno1 autoantibodies with the patient clinicopathological parameters is illustrated in table 7 .
also in consideration of the high baseline od values observed with negative controls , od levels of autoantibodies against hsp70 , rnh1 and eno1 were arbitrarily arrayed into high ( od > 0.2630 for anti - hsp70 , od > 0.7185 for anti - eno1 and od > 0.5615 for anti - rnh1 ) or low ( od <= 0.2630 for anti - hsp70 , od <= 0.7185 for anti - eno1 and od <= 0.5615 for anti - rnh1 ) .
remarkably , the comparison between the cca invasive phenotype and carcinoma in situ or mucinous type , identified elevated hsp70 and eno1 autoantibodies as significantly correlated with cca invasiveness ( 7 cases had high od vs 5 cases had low od of autoantibodies for invasive type and 6 cases had low od vs no cases with high od of autoantibodies for carcinoma in situ or mucinous type , p = 0.038 by chi - square test ) .
nonetheless , no correlation between autoantibodies levels and age , sex , histopathologic features , metastasis , or survival were seen ( data not shown ) .

discussion post - translational modification of self - proteins can lead to aberrant protein expression or neo - antigens which may then cause the appearance of circulating autoantibodies [ 28 ] - [ 30 ] , as observed in cca [ 34 ] .
we hypothesized that excess of modified proteins may contribute to induce autoantibodies in cca and report for the first time that igg autoantibodies against hsp70 , eno1 and rnh1 are specific to cca and may prove candidates for challenging cases .
among cca - associated autoantigens identified in our study ( table 1 - 4 ) , hsp70 protein is possibly the most intriguing because this is a stress response protein involved in various cell processes such as folding , assembly of newly synthesized proteins and the inhibition of apoptosis acting on the caspase - dependent pathway [ 35 ] .
overproduction of hsp70 leads to increased resistance against apoptosis - inducing agents such as tumor necrosis factor - alpha and doxorubicin [ 36 ] and can promote tumor growth and metastatic potential in rodent models [ 37 ] .
expression of hsp70 was found in cca metastasis tissues [ 38 ] and could be used as marker in cca [ 39 ] .
moreover , autoantibodies against hsp70 have been identified in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , lung disease and alcohol - related disease [ 40 ] - [ 42 ] but not in cca where elevated levels of carbonylated hsp70 protein were reported [ 34 ] .
our elisa data support the view that autoantibodies against hsp70 may discriminate cca from cholangitis , a risk condition for bile duct cancer , cholangitis from healthy individuals and cca from healthy individuals ( table 5 ) .
its level increased from healthy controls to cholangitis to cca , suggesting that hsp70 autoantibodies might be used as not only for early marker but also for screening risk marker of cca .
high sensitivity ( 93.55 %) and specificity ( 73.91 %) of the test to discriminate between cca from healthy individuals suggest that hsp70 autoantibodies might serve as a novel marker for cca in addition to commonly used markers such as ca 19 - 9 ( sensitivity 66 % and specificity of 97 %) [ 43 ] and cea ( sensitivity 68.0 % and specificity of 81.5 %) [ 44 ] which may , however , manifest similar performances for cancers other than cca [ 13 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .
also , igg autoantibodies to hsp70 had higher sensitivity ( 93.55 %) than protein level ( 80 %) for cca diagnosis [ 39 ] .
in this case , hsp70 autoantibody level was significantly higher in cca compared to cholangitis ( p < 0.05 ) .
plasma hsp70 autoantibody level was positively correlated with the diseases progression from healthy control to cholangitis to cca groups ( r = 0.679 , p < 0.001 ) , suggesting that its level correlates with the neoplastic potential and might be used as early marker of cca .
interestingly , the specificity of hsp70 autoantibody levels in cca was improved when combined with autoantibodies against eno1 or rnh1 ( table 6 ) .
therefore , using multiple autoantibodies rather than single marker may enhance cca detection .
we demonstrated that plasma eno1 autoantibody levels are also significantly increased in cca and cholangitis compared to healthy control .
eno1 , a multifunctional protein , is a glycolytic enzyme which is highly expressed in liver tissue and cytoplasm of hyperplastic bile ducts and overexpressed in different cancer types [ 47 ] .
this protein is crucial to the response to hypoxia by tumor cell by increasing cell anaerobic metabolism [ 48 ] and its post - translational modifications by acetylation , methylation and phosphorylation could also be used for diagnostic and prognostic value in oncology [ 47 ] .
moreover , eno1 is found on the surface of cca cells and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and tumor invasiveness [ 49 ] .
western blot failed to identify eno1 autoantibody in our series and we speculate that this may due to the loss of antigenicity of this protein during protein denature process for sds - page and the positive elisa results support this view .
further , autoantibodies against rnh1 proteins were identified in cca .
rnh1 regulates the localization and activity of angiogenin which is involved in cell growth and survival mechanisms [ 50 ] as well as in cancer establishment , growth and metastasis [ 51 ] .
rnh1 regulates the reactive oxygen species contribution to drug resistance in gastric cancer [ 52 ] and the growth and metastasis of bladder cancer [ 53 ] .
cca frequently manifests heterogeneous characteristics which might produce the different level of autoantibodies production .
our results demonstrate that circulating hsp70 , eno1and rnh1 autoantibodies levels are highest in cca with a wide variability .
absorbance values in cca group are high in some cases in parallel with elevated od values in negative controls .
in addition , although autoantibodies against hsp70 , eno1 and rnh1 proteins were not significantly associated with histopathologic features , metastasis , or survival , plasma hsp70 and eno1 autoantibodies levels were able to discriminate between carcinoma in situ or mucinous from invasive phenotype of cca .
these findings are in agreement with the observation of autoantibody production in helicobacter pylori infection - associated gastric cancer [ 15 ] .
in conclusion , our data from a proteomic approach to a well - defined clinical cohort of patients demonstrate that cca plasma include several igg autoantibodies against host proteins and taas which are described herein for the first time .
higher level of hsp70 , rnh1 and eno1 autoantibodies are observed in cca but lower level in healthy individuals or in patients with conditions that pose a clinical challenge to the physician .
underlying mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further studies .
in particular , the combination of hsp70 , eno1 and rnh1 autoantibodies reactivities represent a good candidates as a new biomarker for cca and should thus be investigated in a large - scale prospective study in high - risk subjects such as liver fluke infected thai subjects .

parp inhibitors ( parpi ) are under clinical trial for combination cancer chemotherapy .
in the presence of a parpi , parp - 1 binds dna strand breaks but cannot produce poly ( adp - ribose ) polymers or undergo auto - poly ( adp - ribosyl ) ation .
dna binding is persistent , hindering dna repair .
methylated bases formed as a result of cellular exposure to dna - methylating agents are repaired by dna polymerase beta ( pol beta ) - dependent base excision repair ( ber ) producing a 5 ' - deoxyribose phosphate ( 5 ' - drp ) repair intermediate .
parp - 1 binds and is activated by the 5 ' - drp , and parpi - mediated sensitization to methylating agents is considerable , especially in pol beta - deficient cells .
cells deficient in the ber factor xrcc1 are less sensitized by parpi than are wild - type cells .
parpi sensitization is reduced in cells expressing forms of xrcc1 deficient in interaction with either pol beta or parp - 1 .
in contrast , agents producing oxidative dna damage and 3 ' - rather than 5 ' - repair intermediates are modestly parpi sensitized .
we summarize parpi experiments in mouse fibroblasts and confirm the importance of the 5 ' - drp repair intermediate and functional pol beta and xrcc1 proteins .
understanding the chemistry of repair is key to enhancing the clinical success of parpi .
dna polymerase beta xrcc1 parp - 1 parp inhibitors base excision repair background clinical trials suggest that parp inhibitors ( parpi ) may represent an opportunity to gain selective killing of cancer cells , since the cytotoxic effects make use of deficiencies in cellular dna repair systems that are distinctive for individual tumor cells versus normal tissues ( 1 , 2 ) .
but it has proved difficult to design chemotherapy regimes because of toxic side effects such as myelosuppression .
information enabling prediction of parpi effects is not easy to gain from the literature and may not be well recognized in the community .
we suggest that understanding parpi effects in model systems , such as mouse embryonic fibroblast ( mef ) cells in culture , will be informative for considering strategies in cancer chemotherapy .
we have discussed this viewpoint in a recent article ( 3 ) .
here , we summarize current experiments with the aim of understanding the roles of parp in mammalian cell dna repair and how the presence of the inhibited parp - 1 protein during base excision repair ( ber ) may promote cell killing .
the level of cell killing observed with dna - damaging agents is modulated by co - treatment with a parpi and by expression of other ber proteins such as xrcc1 and pol beta , and we will outline a model to explain these effects .
selection of specific chemotherapeutic agents combined with specific repair deficiencies in patients may prove to be extremely beneficial .
ber of base damage and binding of parp - 1 to intermediates of ber the mammalian ber pathway is important for the removal of single base lesions in double - stranded genomic dna .
base damage can arise through spontaneous base loss from dna or from base alkylation and oxidation from both endogenous and exogenous sources .
methyl methanesulfonate ( mms ) is a directly acting dna - methylating agent causing alkylation of base nitrogens ( e.g. , 7 - methylguanine ) , whereas the oxidizing agent peroxynitrite produces reactive oxygen species ( ros ) that oxidize dna bases resulting in the promutagenic dna lesion 8 - oxoguanine and other base lesions .
during single - nucleotide ber of a methylated base , repair is initiated by a lesion - specific monofunctional glycosylase ( i.e. , n - methylpurine dna glycosylase ; mpg ) , that removes the damaged base leaving an abasic ( ap ) site in double - stranded dna .
the dna backbone is then incised 5 ' of the ap site by ap endonuclease 1 ( ape1 ) resulting in a 1 - nucleotide ( nt ) gap with margins of 3 ' - oh and 5 ' - deoxyribose phosphate ( drp ) groups .
dna polymerase beta ( pol beta ) binds to this repair intermediate , removes the 5 ' - drp group and performs single - nucleotide gap filling dna synthesis .
many of the glycosylases specific for oxidative dna damage ( e.g. , 8 - oxoguanine dna glycosylase ; ogg1 ) are bifunctional enzymes that have an associated ap lyase activity in addition to their glycosylase activity .
after base removal , this activity cleaves the dna backbone 3 ' to the abasic site leaving 3 ' - drp and 5 ' - po4 margins in a single - nucleotide gap .
ape1 is able to remove the 3 ' - blocking group leaving a 3 ' - oh - containing substrate suitable for dna synthesis and ligation .
in this ber sub - pathway there will be no formation of a 5 ' - deoxyribose - containing blocking group or requirement for pol beta - dependent drp lyase tailoring activity to enable dna ligation ( 4 ) .
parp - 1 is an abundant nuclear protein involved in dna damage recognition .
it can bind to ap sites and single - strand breaks in dna , including the 5 ' - drp - containing intermediate of ber of mms - induced damage .
once bound to dna , parp - 1 becomes catalytically activated synthesizing poly ( adp - ribose ) ( par ) polymers from nad + , and resulting in poly ( adp - ribosyl ) ation of itself , as well as other proteins involved in dna repair and chromatin remodeling ( 5 , 6 ) .
parp - 1 , the first discovered member of a family of proteins , is responsible for the majority of cellular parp activity after dna damage .
following auto - modification , parp - 1 can interact with other ber proteins such as xrcc1 and pol beta enabling their recruitment to the damage site ( 7 , 8 ) .
a recent publication has suggested that parp - 1 recruits xrcc1 to single - strand break repair , but not to sites of oxidative damage ber ( 9 ) .
this may be due the absence of 5 ' - drp intermediate formation during oxidative damage ( 8 - oxoguanine ) repair ( 4 ) .
in the case of methylation damage , after removal of the abasic site sugar by pol beta lyase activity and completion of repair by pol beta gap filling and dna ligation , parp - 1 dissociates from dna , and the par glycosidic bonds are rapidly cleaved , primarily by poly ( adp - ribose ) glycohydrolase ( parg ) ( 10 ) .
in earlier photoaffinity labeling studies , parp - 1 was identified as the predominant ber intermediate - binding factor in the mef cell extract ( 11 ) .
use of other binding ligands revealed parp - 1 binding specificity for the 5 ' - drp - containing ber intermediate with much less binding when an alternate ber intermediate without the 5 ' - drp group was used ( 12 ) .
the results are consistent with a biological role for an interaction between parp - 1 and the 5 ' - drp - containing ber intermediate .
additionally , as discussed below and elsewhere ( 3 ) , and in agreement with the in vitro studies , we find that the cytotoxic effects of cellular parp inhibition correlate very well with the presence of the 5 ' - drp group in the ber intermediate .
parp inhibition and hypersensitivity to dna damage in the presence of a catalytic inhibitor , parp - 1 can still bind to dna damage sites , but auto - ribosylation is prevented ( 1 ) .
in its inhibited and inactivated state , parp - 1 binding to dna is stabilized , hindering the ber process ( 13 ) .
we have proposed that the dna - bound and inhibited parp - 1 molecule results in cytotoxicity due to formation of replication - dependent double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) ( 14 ) .
experiments in mms - treated mefs demonstrated that par synthesis was completely inhibited by the parpi 4 - amino - 1,8 - naphthalimide ( 4 - an ) ( 15 , 16 ) .
wild - type ( wt ) mefs are highly ( 40 - fold ) sensitized to mms and to the methylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide ( tmz ) by 4 - an co - treatment ( 17 ) .
positive tmz / parpi potentiation data have been reported in a number of other systems , e.g. , human tumor cell lines and xenografts ( 18 , 19 ) , and this combination has been successful in phase i clinical trials in patients with solid tumors ( 20 ) or melanoma ( 21 ) .
additionally , a recently reported phase ii study of an inhibitory dose of a parpi with tmz in metastatic melanoma provided evidence for chemopotentiation and increased disease - free survival ( 22 ) .
the authors suggest the need for a phase iii trial comparing tmz with tmz + parpi , also for evaluation of dna repair capacity in patients to identify those most likely to benefit from this combination .
in contrast to the results with tmz and mms , co - treatment with 4 - an has minimal effect ( 1.1 - fold sensitization ) on cellular sensitivity to the reactive oxidant peroxynitrite ( 17 ) .
this agent results in oxidative dna modifications including 8 - oxoguanine , 8 - nitroguanine and single - strand breaks ( 23 ) .
repair of 8 - oxoguanine initiated by the bifunctional ogg1 is not expected to produce the 5 ' - drp blocked repair intermediate .
thus , a key difference in ber following treatment with these two agents ( mms and peroxynitrite ) is initiation by a monofunctional versus a bifunctional glycosylase .
only in the former case ( repair of mms damage by a monofunctional glycosylase ) will there be formation of a repair intermediate with a 5 ' - sugar phosphate blocking group .
the results emphasize that the presence of the 5 ' - drp blocking group is critical for binding parp - 1 and for observing parpi - mediated sensitization to dna damage .
parp inhibitor effects in ber protein - deficient and defective cells the most notable phenotype of pol beta null mefs is hypersensitivity to sn2 alkylating agents such as mms , and to sn1 alkylating agents such as the chemotherapeutic methylating agent tmz ( 24 , 25 ) .
hypersensitivity to these agents in pol beta - deficient mouse fibroblasts can be reversed by expression of either the full - length protein or the 8 kda drp lyase domain with 5 ' - drp gap - tailoring activity ( 26 ) .
xrcc1 - deficient cells are extremely hypersensitive to monofunctional methylating agents including mms and tmz ( 4 ) .
xrcc1 interacts with a number of repair proteins and binding to parp - 1 is critical for recruitment of xrcc1 to damaged sites in dna .
thus , in parp - 1 - deficient cells , recruitment of xrcc1 is hindered ( 7 ) .
the interaction between the amino - terminal domain ( ntd ) of xrcc1 and the polymerase domain of pol beta is essential for recruitment of pol beta to sites of damaged dna ( 27 ) .
hypersensitivity to mms can be reversed by transfection of full - length wt xrcc1 protein into xrcc1 - / - cells ( 28 ) , but as observed previously in cho cells ( 29 ) , only partial reversal is observed following expression of a mutant protein ( v88r ) that does not interact with pol beta .
likewise , there is no rescue of hypersensitivity following expression of the l360r mutant xrcc1 protein that has disrupted folding of the brct i domain and interrupted interaction with parp - 1 ( 30 , 31 ) .
the results suggest that interactions between parp - 1 , xrcc1 , and pol beta are required for the protective effects of xrcc1 and pol beta against mms and tmz exposures .
a high level of sensitization to mms and tmz is observed in both pol beta +/+ and pol beta - / - mefs following combination treatment with 4 - an. interestingly , the level of sensitization of pol beta - / - cells is at least double that observed in pol beta +/+ cells ( figure 1a ) .
thus , when utilizing the tmz + parpi combination , pol beta null cells become considerably more tmz - sensitive than wt cells .
similar pol beta - dependent results were obtained with other agents ( mms , mnu ) that result in dna damage repaired by monofunctional glycosylase - initiated ber .
we propose that through its role in removing the 5 ' - drp intermediate , pol beta is able to regulate the parpi - mediated sensitization in tmz cytotoxicity .
there have been numerous reports of cancer related pol beta single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( 32 , 33 ) .
expression of a drp lyase inactivating mutation would be a critical biomarker for enhancement of tmz + parpi cytotoxicity .
additionally , current assays for drp repair intermediates are used with cell culture models in laboratory research , but have not yet been adapted for clinical use .
such adaptation of these techniques represents an opportunity for translational research .
ongoing studies will address this question .
figure 1 parpi - mediated sensitization to mms and tmz and ability of xrcc1 to interact with pol beta .
( a ) relative sensitization in wild - type and repair protein - deficient mefs ( as indicated ) by a 24 h exposure to the parpi 4 - an. pol beta - deficient cells are more highly sensitized than the wild - type line ( green ) , while xrcc1 - deficient cells are less sensitized ( purple ) .
( b ) level of parpi - mediated sensitization to mms in xrcc1 +/+ ( wt ) and xrcc1 - / - ( null ) mefs , and in xrcc1 null cells expressing mutated xrcc1 proteins ( l360r , v88r and c12a ) as indicated .
( c ) the xrcc1 ntd has been crystallized in two forms : oxidized and reduced ( 34 ) .
an overlay of the oxidized ( colored , pdb id 3lqc ) and reduced ( light gray , pdb id 3k75 ) forms indicates that the amino - termini are on opposite sides of this domain ( nox and nred , respectively ) .
accordingly , the interactions around the amino - termini are very different for these two forms .
the cysteine residues ( c12 and c20 , respectively ) that participate in disulfide bond formation in the oxidized form are indicated .
( d ) ' v88 ' ( green ) of mouse ntd forms a hydrophobic interaction with v306 ( gray ) of pol beta .
this portion of the pol beta - binding interface is similar for both the oxidized and reduced forms of the ntd , and includes the hydrophobic interaction of xrcc1 ' v88 ' with v306 of pol beta .
v88 corresponds to v86 of the structurally characterized human ntd of xrcc1 .
replacing this valine with arginine ( v88r ) significantly reduces the interaction between these proteins ( 28 ) .
in contrast xrcc1 +/+ wt cells are more highly sensitized ( two to threefold ) to mms and tmz than are xrcc1 - / - cells ( figures 1a,b ) .
thus , the interaction between xrcc1 and parp - 1 proteins appears to be required for the strongest parp - inhibitor - mediated sensitization .
expression of wt xrcc1 will stabilize the protein complex through its accessory protein functions , and this will allow for more efficient parp binding to the 5 ' - drp - containing ber intermediate .
another possibility , that xrcc1 may modulate the drp lyase activity of pol beta , is being tested in the laboratory .
sensitization in cells expressing the l360r mutated xrcc1 protein without interaction with parp - 1 ( 30 , 31 ) was similar to that in xrcc1 - / - cells ( figure 1b ) , consistent with the proposal that the interaction between xrcc1 and parp - 1 enables the sensitization .
in xrcc1 - / - cells expressing an xrcc1 mutant ( v88r ) that is compromised in its ability to bind pol beta , sensitization to mms was also about half of the level observed in wt cells ( figure 1b ) .
pol beta and xrcc1 interact through a redox - sensitive binding interface in the n - terminal domain ( ntd ) of xrcc1 ( 34 ) , and equal levels of both oxidized and reduced forms of the full - length protein are found in untreated wt mefs ( 28 ) .
structural characterization of both oxidized and reduced forms of the xrcc1 ntd reveal that they have distinct conformations ( figure 1c ) and a different pol beta functional interaction , with the oxidized form binding tighter to pol beta ( 34 ) .
the disulfide bond between c12 and c20 required for stabilizing the oxidized form is evident in the structure shown , whereas c12 and c20 are far apart in the reduced form ( figure 1c ) .
nevertheless , some portions of the pol beta - binding interface are similar for both the oxidized and reduced forms of the ntd , and this includes the hydrophobic interaction between v306 ( figure 1d ) of pol beta and v88 of mouse xrcc1 ntd (" v88 ") .
cells expressing c12a xrcc1 protein locked in the reduced state are equally as mms resistant as wt cells ( 28 ) .
however , cells expressing reduced c12a xrcc1 have a considerably lower level of parpi - mediated sensitization than wt cells ( 5 - and 23 - fold , respectively ) ( figure 1b ) .
these results are consistent with the requirement for tight xrcc1 - pol beta interaction for strong parpi - mediated sensitization ( v88r in figure 1b ) .
however , the extremely low parpi - mediated sensitization in the cells expressing the reduced xrcc1 protein suggests there may be additional xrcc1 effects linked to its ability to take the oxidized form .
pol beta null cells are minimally hypersensitive to dna oxidants such as peroxynitrite , ir , and bleomycin where repair of oxidative dna damage does not involve significant formation of an intermediate with a 5 ' - sugar phosphate .
the low parpi sensitization observed in wt cells for peroxynitrite co - treatment was also seen in pol beta - deficient cells ( 17 ) , and similar data (<= 3 - fold sensitization ) were obtained for clinically utilized ir and the radiomimetic agent bleomycin .
bleomycin results in formation of ros , oxidized sugars and abasic sites with 3 ' - blocking groups such as 3 ' - phosphoglycolate ( 35 ) , and repair may involve pol beta and ber , but the 5 ' - sugar phosphate blocking group is not abundantly formed .
again the results suggest a requirement for a 5 ' - sugar phosphate - containing repair intermediate for significant cellular hypersensitivity in pol beta - deficient cells .
similarly , despite the hypersensitivity of xrcc1 - / - cells to methylating agents , only low - level hypersensitivity is observed to oxidative dna damage ( 4 ) .
taken together , these results are consistent with a correlation between formation of the 5 ' - drp blocking group and the degree of parpi - mediated sensitization .
in the absence of pol beta , cells will be deficient in the 5 ' - drp gap - tailoring activity , allowing for enhanced binding of parp - 1 to dna damage and for more parpi - mediated sensitization .
these cells therefore demonstrate the concept of synthetic lethality occurring under conditions of parp inhibition in the presence of pol beta - deficiency .
the notion of synthetic lethality explains the vulnerability of cells that are deficient in one pathway in repair ( here pol beta - mediated ber ) and then have repair additionally blocked by a chemical agent ( e.g. , a parpi ) .
a similar well - appreciated situation occurs when parpi are used in brca - and other homologous recombination - deficient cells and tumors ( 36 - 38 ) .
the expression level of specific repair proteins is expected to modulate the degree of parpi - mediated sensitization .
the chemistry of dna damage and repair also regulates parpi effects , since in the absence of the 5 ' - drp group - containing repair intermediate , there is minimal parpi - mediated sensitization .
model for parp inhibitor - mediated cell killing parp inhibitors have become valuable in chemotherapy as part of a combination regime or as monotherapy .
in mef model systems , the magnitude of the cell killing effect of a parpi in combination with a genotoxic agent is dependent on the chemistry of the dna repair intermediate .
inhibition of parp when it is bound to a 5 ' - drp group - containing intermediate results in a dramatic cell sensitization .
in contrast , if the repair intermediate does not have the 5 ' - drp group , both parp - 1 binding and inhibitor - mediated sensitization are minimal .
a schematic model consistent with these results is shown in figure 2 .
it is important to note that the current results do not prove this model , but instead the model is useful as a framework for designing future experiments .
the model illustrates a replication fork colliding with the ber repair protein complex bound at the 5 ' - drp - containing site in double - stranded genomic dna .
the replication fork moves in the direction of the arrow and becomes stalled at the protein complex , consisting of parp - 1 , pol beta , and xrcc1 , among other proteins not shown in the image .
replication fork stalling is proposed to lead to fork collapse , dsb formation , and eventually to cell death .
thus , fork stalling is proportional to cell killing , at least in the context of this model .
the model predicts that in the absence of inhibited parp - 1 or the 5 ' - drp group , the protein complex will not form .
figure 2 schematic model illustrating parpi - mediated cell killing .
shown is a replication fork colliding with the ber repair complex bound at the 5 ' - drp of the ber intermediate .
the replication fork moves in the direction indicated by the arrow and becomes stalled at the protein complex .
we propose that stalling leads to replication fork collapse , dsb formation , and cell death .
pol beta is able to remove the 5 ' - drp group from repair intermediates .
in pol beta null ber - deficient mefs , excess 5 ' - drp group - containing intermediates may accumulate , and parp - 1 binding and parpi - mediated sensitization will be considerable .
the model illustrates that the drp group is key for parp - 1 binding , such that in the absence of pol beta drp lyase activity , there is more parp - 1 binding and more parpi - induced cell killing .
in the absence of xrcc1 , pol beta binding at damaged dna is decreased and this is expected to lead to diminished drp group removal and more cell killing .
further , the model predicts that in the absence of xrcc1 the stability of the complex will be reduced , and consequently the replication fork may be able to bypass the complex without stalling .
the weaker affinity of the reduced form of xrcc1 for pol beta is consistent with a less stable overall complex , more replication fork bypass , and less parpi - mediated cell killing as observed experimentally .
the results are consistent with this prediction in that the absence of xrcc1 expression , or less binding of xrcc1 to parp - 1 or pol beta , is associated with lower parpi - mediated sensitization .
in summary , parpi are under study for use in cancer chemotherapy and here we report that the ability for parpi - induced sensitization in model mammalian cell lines ( mouse fibroblasts ) correlates with the chemistry of dna repair intermediates .
surprisingly , we find that in the absence of the 5 ' - drp group - containing repair intermediate , there is minimal parpi - mediated sensitization .
additionally , we show that the presence of functional ber factors pol beta and xrcc1 regulate parpi - induced sensitization , but this is only under conditions where the 5 ' - drp group is formed .

crispr cas9 genome editing golden gate assembly orthogonal genetic manipulation the relative ease of using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( crispr ) - associated proteins ( cas - proteins ) in genome editing has rapidly made this rna - guided endonuclease system the method of choice in almost all current applications involving genetic manipulations , with cas9 from s. pyogenes ( spcas9 ) being the most well characterized and broadly used [ 1 ] .
compared to the early generations of programmable dna endonucleases such as the zinc - finger nuclease ( zfn ) or transcription activator - like effector nuclease ( talen ) , the crispr - cas9 system is time - , labor - , and cost - effective .
mediated by a small guide rna ( sgrna or grna ) , cas9 can specifically introduce double - strand dna breaks at pre - selected genomic loci which ( i ) contain a target sequence ( also known as a protospacer ) complementary to the typically 20 - nt guide sequence of the grna , and ( ii ) are followed by a protospacer sequence adjacent motif ( pam , 5 ' - ngg - 3 ' for spcas9 ) .
furthermore , by co - delivery of cas9 and multiple grnas , the crispr / cas9 system enables the simultaneous modification of several loci / genes in the same cell [ 2 ] .
currently , most crispr - cas9 - based studies rely on plasmid - based or viral vector mediated expression of the cas9 and grnas .
the generation of plasmids expressing multiple grnas has been a time - consuming procedure involving multiple steps of cloning .
to facilitate crispr - mediated multiplexed gene editing applications , we have opted for the golden - gate assembly method and developed a system for rapid construction of plasmids expressing up to 30 grnas within one week [ 3 ] .
golden - gate assembly has been an attractive and cost - effective method for rapidly assembly of multiple dna fragments in a single reaction .
this method uses a special class of enzymes ( type iis restriction enzymes ) which recognize asymmetric dna sequences and induce staggered dna - cleavage outside of their recognition sites .
three type iis restriction enzymes have been favored for golden - gate assembly : bbsi ( 5 ' - gaagac ( 2 / 6 ) ; i.e. it cleaves at 2 and 6 nt downstream of the sense strand and antisense strand , respectively , and creates a 4 - nt 5 ' overhang ) , bsai ( 5 ' - ggtctc ( 1 / 5 )) , and bsmbi ( 5 ' - cgtctc ( 1 / 5 )) [ 4 ] .
these three enzymes have 6 nt recognition sites , thus minimizing the frequency of such sites in genomic dna ( approximately one recognition site in 46 nt ) .
furthermore , the generation of 4 - nt overhangs can in principle allow for the assembly of up to 128 ( 4x4x4x2 ) different dna fragments in one step .
to minimize the number of plasmids , we utilized a three - step golden - gate assembly ( gga ) strategy to generate a vector carrying up to 30 grna expression cassettes : first , double - strand grna guide oligonucleotides with 4 - nt 5 ' overhangs ( 5 ' - cacc sense strand , 5 ' - aaac antisense strand ) are cloned to a set of single grna expression modular plasmids using bbsi - mediated gga ; secondly , up to ten modular grna expression plasmids are assembled into a second modular plasmid using bsai - mediated gga to generate a plasmid expressing 2 to 10 grnas ; finally up to three such secondary modular plasmids can be assembled to generate a final plasmid using bsmbi - mediated gga and thus generating a single plasmid expressing up to 30 grnas .
a proof - of - concept validation of the multiplexed grna expression array has been conducted in crispr - based simultaneous gene knockout and inhibitions using our dual - fluorescent reporter system ( c - check ) and in human cells [ 3 , 5 ] .
however , the system is in principle compatible with all applications that employ simultaneous delivery of multiple spcas9 grnas into one cell , such as crispr - mediated epigenetic modification [ 6 ] or gene activation ( crispra ) [ 7 ] .
studies by konermann s. , et al .
[ 7 ] and us ( xiong k. et al. submitted ) show that the synergistic activation mediator composed of a combination of grna 2.0 , nls - dcas9 - vp64 and ms2 - p65 - hsf1 is the most effective transcriptional activation system developed .
to further expand the applicability of our multiplexed grna expression array system , we have generated another set of modular plasmids that encode a single grna 2.0 , which contains ms2 loops at the tetraloop and stemloop 2 of the grna scaffold ( unpublished results ) .
other applications that may benefit from our multiplexed grna expression array are simultaneous orthogonal genetic manipulations , such as gene inhibition , activation , and knockout .
several other cas9 orthologues have been identified such as cas9 from neisseria meningitides ( nmcas9 ) , staphylococcus aureus ( sacas9 ) , and cpf1 [ 8 ] .
these cas9 orthologues have efficient genome - editing activity but bind a variety of pam and use different grna scaffolds .
to further expand the multiplexed grna expression array kit , future studies should be conducted to generate grna expression modular plasmids for each cas9 ortholog .
co - delivery of different cas9 orthologues along with the corresponding grnas will allow simultaneous , orthogonal , and sophisticated genetic manipulations and facilitate the study of genetic circuits ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 schematic illustration of simultaneous and orthogonal gene inhibition , activation , and knockout using cas9 orthologues and multiplexed grna expression array six modular grna expression plasmids , with two grnas for each cas9 orthologs ( spcas9 , sacas9 , and nmcas9 ) , are assembled into one multiplexed grna expression array based on bsal - mediated golden - gate assembly .
letter " b " and arrows indicated the bsal recognition site and cleavage position , respectively .
co - delivery of the multiplexed grna expression array with the nuclease - deficient spcas9 fused to transcriptional activation domain vp64 ( dspcas9 - vp64 ) , nuclease - deficient sacas9 fused to transcriptional repression domain krab ( dsacas9 - krab ) , and wild type nmcas9 enables simultaneous and orthogonal activation of gene a. , inhibition of gene b. , and knockout of gene c. asterisks (*) represent nuclease - deficient mutations .
to facilitate the broad application of our method , all plasmids developed in this study as well as those developed in the future have been made publically available through the nonprofit global plasmid repository addgene ( https :// www.addgene.org / yonglun _ luo /) .
a more detailed step - by - step protocol will be presented through bio - protocol .
in addition to the above - mentioned improvements , multiplexed grna expression array plasmids driven by different promoters will also be generated in future studies .

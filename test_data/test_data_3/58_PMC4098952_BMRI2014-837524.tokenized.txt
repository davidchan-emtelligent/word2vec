our laboratory utilized biomimicry to develop a synthetic bone scaffold based on hydroxyapatite - gelatin - calcium silicate ( hgcs ) .
here , we evaluated the potential of hgcs scaffold in bone formation in vivo using the rat calvarial critical - sized defect ( csd ) .
twelve sprague - dawley rats were randomized to four groups : control ( defect only ) , decellularized bone matrix ( decbm ) , and hgcs with and without multipotent adult progenitor cells ( mapcs ) .
decbm was prepared by removing all the cells using sds and nh4oh .
after 12 weeks , the csd specimens were harvested to evaluate radiographical , histological , and histomorphometrical outcomes .
the in vitro osteogenic effects of the materials were studied by focal adhesion , mts , and alizarin red .
micro - ct analysis indicated that the decbm and the hgcs scaffold groups developed greater radiopaque areas than the other groups .
bone regeneration , assessed using histological analysis and fluorochrome labeling , was the highest in the hgcs scaffold seeded with mapcs .
the decbm group showed limited osteoinductivity , causing a gap between the implant and host tissue .
the group grafted with hgcs + mapcs resulting in twice as much new bone formation seems to indicate a role for effective bone regeneration .
in conclusion , the novel hgcs scaffold could improve bone regeneration and is a promising carrier for stem cell - mediated bone regeneration .
1. introduction a critical - sized defect ( csd ) is known as the smallest size tissue defect that will not completely heal by itself over the duration of the experiment or the life of the subject [ 1 , 2 ] .
a csd caused by neoplastic , inflammatory , congenital , or traumatic etiologies requires a mechanically stiff biomaterial ( scaffold ) and a cell source ( osteoblasts ) for the effective regeneration [ 3 - 5 ] .
current available options to repair csd are autografts allografts and alloplastic grafts ( synthetic bone substitutes ) .
the autograft is the gold standard , but there are only a few bones that can be used as donor tissue and frequently result in donor site morbidity .
allografts have a high risk of tissue rejection and potential viral or bacterial transmission ; moreover , poor tissue integration with host tissue causes the grafting failure rate of 15 to 25 % [ 6 - 8 ] .
since both options are highly limited by the age of the donors / recipients and their availability , the demand for synthetic bone substitutes has been increasing as an alternative source for bone regeneration .
although hydroxyapatite ( ha ) is the most widely studied stiff scaffold material , the frequency of its clinical use is less than 10 % of all bone grafting procedures due to its unstable fixation and insufficient interaction with host tissues [ 7 ] .
instead , hydroxyapatite composites ( e.g. , hydroxyapatite plus collagen derivatives ) have been developed to mimic biochemical and biomechanical properties of natural bone in order to enhance osteointegration and graft healing for potential biomedical applications [ 9 , 10 ] .
the rapidly evolving technology enables the development of biomimetic nanocomposite biomaterials that fulfill the current requirements of an improved bone scaffold .
recently , a new biomimetic nanocomposite , hydroxyapatite gelatin - calcium silicate ( hgcs ) , has been developed to address the processability of the hydroxyapatite nanocomposite [ 11 - 13 ] .
hgcs amalgamates the hydroxyapatite - gelatin ( hg : degraded collagen ) composite particles by in situ pozzolanic formation of calcium silicate ( cs ) , which interacts among gelatin , silica , and calcium hydroxide ( ca ( oh ) 2 ) .
we find that hgcs improves cytocompatibility , increases in vitro osteogenesis , and has a greater mechanical strength when compared to previous hydroxyapatite - collagen and hydroxyapatite - gelatin nanocomposites .
above all , the compressive strength of hgcs is significantly higher than that of hg. notably , the cs formed by the chemical reaction between silica and calcium hydroxide affects the mechanical properties of hgcs scaffolds , which increased from 43.7 to 93.6 mpa ( unpublished in - house data ) .
therefore , the addition of cs could enhance the mechanical strength .
the performance of hgcs for in vitro and in vivo ostegenesis is , however , unknown , which fuels an additional investigation .
another unique scaffold material is decellularized natural bone matrix ( decbm ) , which has received attention due to its natural origin and because it is expected to serve as a rigid scaffolding material similar to hgcs .
hashimoto et al. were the first to report a decellularization method for rat femurs using high pressure and measured the potential of cells to repopulate the bone [ 14 ] .
their evaluation was restricted to subcutaneous implantation , which requires further investigation with the in vivo bony defect model .
the present study will develop a simplified laboratory protocol for bone decellularization and compare the applicability of decellularized calvarial bone matrix to hgcs using the rat calvaria csd model .
both hgcs and decbm may be stiff enough to be utilized as scaffolds to restore bone defects .
for a csd , however , regeneration would require production of extracellular matrices by living cells .
stem cells have been known as an ideal cell source because they are readily available , nonimmunodeficient , and disease free when transplanted into patients .
bone regeneration with a cell - seeded scaffold was proven to have better regeneration potential than without cells .
bone marrow - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( bm - mscs ) have been widely used and proved to have high osteogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo [ 15 , 16 ] .
multipotent adult progenitor cells ( mapcs ) are adult stem cells originated from bone marrow as well .
mapcs can form all three germ layers , in which mesoderm can give rise to bone tissue when dexamethasone is present [ 17 ] .
since mapcs express higher levels of stem cell makers such as oct - 3 / 4 , show a high proliferative rate , and can exert immunosuppressive effects on t - cell alloreactivity and proliferation , they are expected to become an alternative cell source for bone tissue engineering [ 18 - 21 ] .
mapcs were initially isolated from mice and rats , and specifically applied in bone tissue engineering by ferreira et al. mapcs have yielded positively in vitro osteogenic differentiation and in vivo bone formation [ 22 , 23 ] .
in the present study , we developed the hgcs scaffold and investigated its osteogenic efficiency in healing of csds by comparing it with decbm ( natural matrix ) and csds with no graft as control .
we also evaluated whether the bone formation process using the hgcs is related to the presence of mapcs .
given the known positive effects of cs added to the hg scaffold for bone regeneration , the cooperative interaction between mapcs and hgcs scaffold showed facilitated bone regeneration .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
preparation of hgcs scaffold and decbm the hgcs scaffolds were prepared by in situ hybridization of cs with hg powders which were biomimetically synthesized by the coprecipitation method .
the method to synthesize hap - gel slurry was well described in previous studies [ 11 ] .
briefly , the calcium hydroxide powder was mixed with hg powder and cross - linked with entmos ( bis [ 3 - ( trimethoxysilyl ) - propyl ] ethylenediamine ) for 30 seconds .
to initiate the sol - gel reaction , calcium chloride solution ( 48 mul ) was added to the mixture .
when the mixture began thickening , it was quickly transferred into 1cc syringes with 1 mm inner diameter needles .
the hgcs paste was extruded from the syringe as intertwined threads to generate the macroporosity .
the samples were dried in air for one week and then sterilized with ethylene oxide gas .
to prepare the decbm , the rat calvaria were harvested ( natural bone matrix : nbm ) using a trephine burr ( 8 mm in diameter ) and washed with distilled water for 1 hour to remove blood elements .
they were placed into a decellularizing solution containing 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ; sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) and 0.1 % ammonium hydroxide ( nh4oh : sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) and placed on a mechanical shaker at room temperature .
the detergent solution was replaced every 36 hours for 3 weeks .
the completion of the decellularization process was confirmed by histology ( hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) staining ) and dna assay .
then , the decbm samples were repeatedly washed with distilled water until detergents were completely removed from the matrix .
the decbm samples were sterilized using the same dose of gamma irradiation ( 10,000 gy ) as vascular decellularized grafts before implantation [ 24 ] .
2.2 .
mechanical property of gemosil - cs and decbm the compressive strength of hgcs ( n = 10 ) was determined with the use of an instron ( model 4204 , canton , ma , usa ) and compared to hg specimens ( n = 10 ) .
all samples were prepared in a cylindrical shape with a 1 : 2 ratio of diameter ( 3.5 mm ) to length ( 7.0 mm ) .
the uniaxial force ( 0.5 mm / min ) was applied to the samples for compressive strength , and five samples were evaluated per group .
the result was determined from the maximum strength value on the stress - strain curve .
due to the inherent shape of the calvaria , decellularized calvaria samples were tested using the three - point bending method .
the strip sample , 6.3 mm in length ( l ) x 6 mm in width ( d ) x 0.8 mm in thickness ( t ) , was prepared and tested at the cross - head speed of 0.1 mm / min .
the force was recorded in real time and peak force ( f ) at failure was measured .
the bending flexure strength of decellularized calvaria ( n = 10 ) was calculated by the formula 3fl / 2dt 2 .
the fresh calvaria samples ( nbm , n = 10 ) were tested for comparison .
2.3 .
thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ) of decbm the decellularized and nondecellularized ( natural ) calvarial bone samples were air - dried and ground to powders .
natural calvarial bone powders were used as controls. from each group , 10 mg of powder was placed on a platinum sample holder , which was then loaded inside the q - 500 thermogravimetric analyzer ( ta instrument , new castle , de , usa ) .
the test was performed in the temperature range from 30degreesc to 800degreesc with a heating rate of 5degreesc / min .
weight changes were recorded in terms of temperature .
2.4 .
in vitro osteogenic study of hgcs and decbm mc3t3 - e1 preosteoblasts were isolated from mouse calvaria and subcultured to test in vitro cytocompatibility and osteogenic potential for the materials coated on the 35 mm culture dishes using p - 6,000 spin coater ( specialty coating systems , inc. , indianapolis , in , usa ) .
briefly , finely grounded decbm was mixed into 1 ml of methanol and 44.4 mul of entmos by voltexing for 15 seconds .
for hgcs , hg slurry in 1 ml methanol was mixed with 29.6 mg of ca ( oh ) 2 powder and 44.4 mul of entmos by voltexing for 15 seconds .
then 50 mul from each mixture was sprayed in the center of a spinning 35 mm dish on the spin coater and spinned for 20 seconds at 6,000 rpm .
the coated dishes were sterilized under uv for 24 hours and washed with pbs before being used .
2.4.1 .
focal adhesion assay mc3t3 - e1 cell cytoskeletal structures were assessed to reveal cell morphology after 3 days of cell culture on the coated dishes .
following fixation in 4 % formaldehyde , the cells were permeabilized in a 0.5 % triton x - 100 ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) in pbs for 5 min .
after blocking with 5 % of bsa solution , the cells were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin ( 1 : 100 ratio in 5 % bsa / pbs , monoclonal , molecular probes , or , usa ) and anti - beta - tubulin primary antibody ( 1 : 100 ratio in 5 % bsa / pbs , monoclonal anti - human , sigma , uk ) overnight at 4degreesc .
then , the cells were thoroughly washed in 0.05 % tween 20 in pbs and incubated with fitc conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 50 ratio in 5 % bsa / pbs , vector laboratories , uk ) for 1 h at 4degreesc .
the nuclei of cells were stained with vectashield ( r ) mounting medium with dapi ( vector laboratories , inc. , burlingame , ca usa ) and images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope ( nikon eclipse ti - u , nikon instruments , melville , ny ) .
2.4.2 .
mts assay the proliferation of the mc3t3 - e1 cells on the coated dishes was conducted using mts assay as instructed in company manual .
the mts ( 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 5 - ( 3 carboxymethoxyphenyl ) - 2 - ( 4 - sulfophenyl ) - 2h - tetrazolium ) ( promega co. , madison , wi , usa ) reacted with cells for an hour .
then absorbance of each group was measured on days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 , respectively , at 490 nm using a plate reader ( biorad , hercules , ca , usa ) .
2.4.3 .
mineralization assay for differentiation , mc3t3 - e1 cells were cultured directly on the hgcs - and decbm - coated 35 mm dishes with osteogenic media for 4 , 7 , and 21 days .
after washing with pbs , the cells were fixed for 10 minutes in formalin , washed , stained with 40 mm alizarin red ( acros organics , geel , belgium ) at ph 4.2 for 10 minutes , rinsed with deionized water 6 times , and air - dried .
mineralized nodule images were obtained with a nikon eclipse ti - u microscope ( nikon instruments inc. , melville , ny , usa ) .
2.5 .
in vivo implantation of scaffolds rat mapcs were isolated , expanded , and seeded onto the hgcs scaffolds ( n = 3 ) .
the isolation , culture , and seeding on the scaffold of rat mapcs were described in our previous study [ 23 ] .
twelve male sprague - dawley rats ( charles river , wilmington , ma , about 250 g , 7 weeks ) were initially anesthetized by intramuscular injection of 10 mg / kg ketamine - hcl ( puteney inc. , portland , me , usa ) and additional ketamine was administered during experiment as needed .
after shaving and sterilizing the surgical site , an approximately 2 cm mid - sagittal skin incision was made from occipital to frontal scalp , and the subcutaneous tissue was dissected and reflected to each side with the periosteum to expose the osseous surface of the skull .
an 8 mm csd was created without damaging the underlying dura and mid - sagittal blood vessels using a low - speed dental trephine burr .
four treatment groups with three rats each underwent surgery for a total of 12 csds .
the small sample size ( n = 3 ) was chosen because this was a screening / pilot test for a series of developing biomaterials as indicated in our previous reports [ 23 ] .
three experimental groups used different types of scaffolds ( decbm , hgcs seeded with mapcs , and hgcs ) .
the control group consisted of csds with no grafting at all .
after implantation of the scaffold materials , the periosteum was closed with 4 - 0 chromic gut suture , and then skin was closed with 3 - 0 silk suture .
to prevent postsurgical infection , 20 mg / kg of cefazolin ( hospira inc. , lake forest , il , usa ) was injected intramuscularly once per day for 7 days after surgery .
for the mineral apposition rate ( mar ) measurement , fluorochrome labels such as alizarin red - s ( 30 mg / kg , sigma aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) and calcein ( 20 mg / kg , sigma aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) were injected perivascularly to each animal twice during the study .
alizarin red was administered 10 days after the surgery and calcein was given 15 days before sacrifice .
the interlabeling periods were 10 and 70 days for rats sacrificed at 12 weeks .
2.6 .
micro - ct analysis rats were sacrificed 12 weeks after scaffold implantation .
the calvaria were excised carefully by preserving the implanted sites and then fixed in 10 % formaldehyde for 7 days at 4degreesc .
subsequently , they were transferred into 70 % isopropyl alcohol .
the calvaria explants were scanned by using a micro - ct system ( mct 40 ; scanco medical , bruttisellen , switzerland ) at 70 kv and 114 ma with a 200 ms integration time .
detailed setting parameters for acquisition and analysis of the acquired images were described in a previous study [ 15 ] .
after 3d reconstruction , the percentage of radiopaque areas in the defects was measured using the nikon nis elements software and tabulated by treatment group .
the radiopacity (%) was obtained by dividing the new radiopaque areas in the csd by the total defect area .
the data were presented as average +/ - standard deviation .
one - way anova was used to compare the means among four groups .
2.7 .
mineral apposition rate ( mar ) by fluorescence microscopy harvested calvaria specimens were dehydrated and subsequently infiltrated with resin ( technovit , heraeus kulzer gmbh , germany ) for 23 days .
the method for the slide preparation was described previously [ 20 ] .
the polished sections were viewed using a nikon fluorescence microscope apparatus with bright field , tritc and fitc filters , and a nikon eclipse ti - u digital camera ( nikon instruments inc. , melville , ny , usa ) .
each fluorescent image was merged to measure the distance between fluorescent labeled layers at the interface between native bone and the implanted scaffold ( inbs ) and at the central pore area with the nikon nis elements software ( nikon instruments inc. , melville , ny , usa ) tools .
a total of five measurements were made along the span of each double label .
the mar was calculated using the following equation : mar ( mum / day ) = sumchi / nt , where sumchi is the sum of all the measurements between double labels , n is the total number of measurements , and t is the time ( days ) interval expressed [ 25 - 27 ] .
the mean distance of the five regions was subject to statistical analysis and the overall mean distance was calculated for each group .
two - way anova was used to compare the means among four groups .
2.8 .
histological determination for new bone tissue formation after analysis for mar study , calvaria specimen slides were further stained with steven 's blue by counterstaining with van gieson to visualize the formation of newly formed bone ( nfb ) tissue for the quantitation as previously described [ 23 ] .
briefly , entire images of the medial ( central ) sagittal histologic section were acquired with a dp70 color digital camera equipped with color image software ( dp11 , olympus usa , center valley , pa , usa ) under 20x magnification and then merged using adobe photoshop cs6 ( adobe systems inc. , san jose , ca usa ) to recreate as one figure .
the new bone surface area ( b.ar. ) and the total area of each defect ( t.ar. ) were measured in pixels by using an automated image analysis system ( image j software version 1.46r , nih , bethesda , md , usa ) to calculate the nfb ( in % : b.ar. / t.ar / 0.01 ) based on the standardized protocols of the american society for bone and mineral research [ 28 ] .
the one tail student t - test was used to compare the means between the groups .
3. results and discussion the two main components of tissue engineering constructs for in vivo implantation are the cells and the scaffold material .
since the bone regenerating potential of mapcs was well reported in previous studies [ 18 , 23 ] , our efforts were focused mainly on the materials aspect to compare natural and synthetic components in bone regeneration .
previously , hg was developed by mimicking natural bone matrix ( hydroxyapatite and collagen derivative ) with promising properties for bone regeneration [ 29 ] .
however , the weak bonding force between hg particles and siloxane was prone to brittle fracture and resulted in a relatively low compressive strength when compared to natural bone .
applying cs to hg created a new scaffold material , hgcs , which not only reinforced its mechanical strength but also improved osteoblast adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation by the stimulation of released calcium ions .
another value of this study was to apply a naturally derived biomaterial via removing cellular components from the matrix for the bone regeneration .
decbm was expected to be an ideal candidate for a scaffold due to its function as supporting structure and regulator of cellular functions such as cell viability , proliferation , and differentiation [ 30 - 33 ] .
indeed , the natural ecm is known to have a modulatory effect of signal transduction triggered by bioactive molecules ( growth factors and cytokines ) [ 34 , 35 ] .
it could be preserved even after decellularization , as described in previous applications on various tissues [ 36 , 37 ] .
here , we developed an allogenic natural bone scaffold using a decellularization technique to compare it with a synthetic scaffold ( hgcs ) for the potential of in vivo bone regeneration .
3.1 .
characterization of decbm and hgcs the duration of the decellularization process for rat calvaria was optimized by 0.5 % sds and 0.1 % nh4oh dissolved in distilled water [ 38 , 39 ] .
this process effectively disrupted cell membranes and cleaved dna to minimize immunological rejection .
the completion of decellularization was confirmed by histology and dna assay .
after 2 weeks , h & e staining of the decellularized tissue revealed absence of both nuclei and cytoplasmic compartments ( figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b )) and no dna was detected from agarose gel electrophoresis ( figure 1 ( e )) .
removing the cells from the matrix is an important step because it may prevent humoral immune reactions against membrane proteins .
it is also important to completely remove dna from the matrix because it can stimulate the immune system by activating cytokine production and b - cell immunoglobulin secretion after allogenic or xenogenic implantation [ 40 ] .
scanning electron microscope ( sem ) evaluation revealed that both matrices exhibited similar morphology in the distribution of collagen and mineralized fibers residing in the matrix ( figures 1 ( c ) and 1 ( d )) .
in nbm cells are attached and embedded into the matrix ; in decbm cells are absent , confirming the effective decellularization from the calvarial bone tissue .
the tga data reveals the typical pattern of mineral tissues with a higher inorganic to organic ratio in decbm than in nbm ( figure 2 ( b )) .
absorbed water inside the decbm and nbm could be removed completely by heating to 200degreesc .
the weight loss of the samples was attributed to the thermal degradation of proteins including collagen , noncollagenous proteins , and cell membranes ( 300 - 560degreesc ) [ 41 ] .
the nbm samples indicated a continuous weight drop from 300 to 550degreesc .
the decbm samples showed an abrupt weight drop from 300degreesc to 400degreesc , ceased at 450degreesc , and then followed with a gradual weight drop until 600degreesc .
the final weight remainder represents the percentage of inorganic content in the matrix .
in fact , the final weight % of decbm ( 65 %) was greater than that of nbm ( 58 %) , indirectly verifying that approximately 7 % of the organic contents were removed through the decellularizing process .
the integrity of the bone matrix directly associated with mechanical strength was measured by the three - point bending test and the compression test in decbm and hgcs , respectively .
the mean values of the three - point bending test were 72.00 +/ - 14.14 mpa and 89.36 +/ - 17.34 mpa for decellularized and nondecellularized bones , respectively ( figure 2 ( a )) .
the decellularization process decreased the mechanical strength by 19.42 % ( n = 10 , p < 0.05 ) in decbm compared to nbm .
the difference was possibly caused by an enzymatic effect on the structural proteins and more likely due to a loss of soluble protein by sds during the decellularizing process .
sds was considered to be a better choice than nonionic agents to thoroughly remove soluble proteins from the matrix in such a hard and compact tissue like bone ( in - house nonpublished data ) .
the compressive strength of hgcs was significantly higher than that of hg. certainly , cs played a role in increasing this mechanical property of the hgcs scaffold from 43.7 to 93.6 mpa ( in - house nonpublished data ) .
this reinforcement is attributed to the in situ formation of cs due to the chemical reaction between silica and calcium hydroxide .
therefore , both decbm and hgcs implants can provide strength approaching that of natural bone though the values were still inferior to natural bone .
3.2 .
in vitro osteoblasts attachment , growth , and osteogenic differentiation on decbm - and hgcs - coated dishes to understand osteoblast - scaffold interactions , their in vivo bioactivity , and cell integration within the scaffold material during bone regeneration , the materials were assessed in vitro by culturing osteoblasts directly on hgcs and grounded decbm - coated dishes .
prior to use , the quality of the coating was confirmed by observing them under a microscope for even distribution of the materials and consistency of coating .
in the control group ( no - coating ) , the focal adhesion assay with mc3t3 - e1 preosteoblasts generally indicated a round cell morphology in which their actin filaments were spread out in multiple directions by attaching with well - distributed vinculins in the dish ( figure 3 ( a )) .
cells grown on the decbm - and hgcs - coated dishes demonstrated less spreading but still had similar morphology as the control group cells .
most of the vinculins were observed near or on the material particles , which supports decbm and hgcs as being good substrates for cell attachment ( figures 3 ( b ) and 3 ( c )) .
mts assay and mineralization studies were performed for in vitro osteogenic potential with mc3t3 - e1 cells on material - coated dishes .
since a higher number of cells represent a higher formazan activity , we analyzed the mts assay for the cell proliferative potential by measuring the formazan activity over time .
figure 3 ( d ) shows the mts activity of the mc3t3 - e1 cells measured on days 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 .
the number of cells on both decbm - and hgcs - coated dishes increased up to 7 days .
cells on hgcs - coated dishes showed a higher proliferative potential than those on decbm , but less potential than those of the control group between days 1 and 7 .
the lower growth potential on decbm compared to the control group was partially due to the growth behavior of the cells on the coated matrix .
the topography of decbm coatings would delay the cell growth in early time points due to an increased surface area , but the cells grew similarly to the control group after 7 days .
the cells on decbm grew by aggregating around decbm particles and formed thread - like collagen structures ( data not shown ) , which resulted in a multilayered cell culture , unlike hgcs and control groups .
mineralization was evaluated by nodule formation on days 7 , 14 , and 21 after differentiation with the osteogenic media ( alpha - mem with 10 mm beta - glycerophosphate ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) and 0.2 mm ascorbic acid ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa )) .
in the controls , calcium nodules were visible 14 days after differentiation and became darker and larger at 21 days , consistent with the typical mineralization pattern of mc3t3 - e1 cells under our differentiation conditions ( figure 3 ( e )) .
decbm - coated dishes showed earlier nodule formation and overall were more intense and larger than in the control dish at days 14 and 21 ( figure 3 ( g )) .
however , the microscopic pattern of calcium deposition on the hgcs - coated dish was very different than on the decbm and the control dishes ( figure 3 ( f )) .
cells on the hg started to form small nodule particles , which then enlarged and surrounded the ca ( oh ) 2 particles ( white arrows ) .
alizarin red staining revealed that ca ( oh ) 2 particles were located in the middle of most nodules and likely promoted osteogenic differentiation by providing calcium ions .
ca ( oh ) 2 - coated dishes without cells were also stained to serve as negative control .
3.3 .
in vivo bone regeneration ( mineral apposition rate ) four groups were tested for bone regeneration in the rat calvaria critical - sized defect model : empty defects ( control group ) , decbm , hgcs scaffolds seeded with mapcs ( hgcs + mapcs ) , and hgcs scaffolds only .
after 12 weeks of postimplantation , the entire calvarial was harvested for mar , gross , radiographic , and histomorphometric analyses .
to evaluate the bone formation rate , mar was assessed by measuring a total of six randomly selected points along the span of each scaffold .
these were double - labeled at both the interface between the host tissue and the scaffold ( ibhs ) and in the middle of the defect where healing bone infiltrated into the porous scaffold ( sid ) .
the results of fluorochrome labeled histology ( a to d ) and the mar measurements ( e ) are presented in figure 4 .
at the ibhs , both hgcs + mapcs and hgcs groups demonstrated higher mar values ( 2.72 +/ - 0.34 mum / day and 2.67 +/ - 0.2 mum / day , resp. ) than the empty defect control group , which had mar of 1.6 +/ - 0.53 mum / day .
in addition , the mar value in the decbm group was 0.87 +/ - 0.07 mum / day , which was the lowest rate of mineral apposition .
at the ibhs of the decbm group , only a few areas expressed the fluorochromes , signifying that osteoblasts were scantly present and that there was low osteoblastic activity .
according to the previous study by parfitt et al. , the total rate of bone formation was affected by the number of osteoblasts and the average volume of matrix secreted by the osteoblasts [ 42 , 43 ] .
the highest mar in the sid was in the hgcs + mapcs group ( 1.02 +/ - 0.23 mum / day ) .
the mar in the hgcs - only group ( 0.82 +/ - 0.1 mum / day ) was greater than in the decbm group ( 0.41 +/ - 0.1 mum / day ) .
the difference in mar between the hgcs group and the hgcs + mapcs group may be due to the mapcs differentiating into osteoblasts in vivo , therefore increasing their activity and the rate of bone mineral apposition in the sid .
the mar of the decbm group in the sid can only be measured on the surface of the decbm and not inside of the scaffold .
in the control group , the mar in the sid could not be calculated because the empty defects did not heal after 12 weeks ( figure 4 ( e )) .
overall , the hgcs + mapcs and hgcs groups showed increased mar over the decbm and the empty defect ( control ) groups .
in addition , the mar in the decbm group was only detectable on the surface of the decbm .
fluorochromes were observed to be deposited only on the surface of the decbm scaffold because decbm has inadequate pores ; there was no cell migration into the matrix to regenerate bone .
in the hgcs with and without mapcs groups , fluorochrome labels could be seen extensively with measureable distances , whereas the empty defect group had them only at the periphery of the defect .
although mar was a significant indicator for mineral apposition rate at a specified timeframe , further assessment by histomorphometry and radiographic analysis can provide more information regarding the total new bone formation ( nbf ) .
3.4 .
in vivo bone regeneration ( histomorphometry and 3d micro - ct evidence ) after fluorochrome imaging , the undecalcified resin sections were stained with steven blue and van gieson histochemistry to identify new bone formation ( fresh red ) in the defect site .
histological evaluation demonstrated that the defect within the hgcs + mapcs group was filled with new bone that bridged with the host bone by 12 weeks .
in the hgcs scaffold - only group new bone was moderate , primarily at the periphery of the defect ( figure 5 ( c )). from all perspectives , bone regeneration was prominently better in the hgcs + mapcs group ( figure 5 ( d )) .
at 12 weeks of postimplantation , quantitative measurements of nbf demonstrated 56.99 +/ - 30.44 % bone regeneration for the hgcs + mapcs group , 24.44 +/ - 3.94 % for the hgcs - only group , 14.45 +/ - 3.94 % for the decbm group , and 21.51 +/ - 8.60 % for the empty defect group .
notably , the newly formed bone in both the hgcs - only and the hgcs + mapcs groups was well integrated at the interface between host bone and the scaffold .
in the middle section of the hgcs - only group , the nbf in the area of macrospores had little calcified tissue ; instead fibrous tissues were seen ( figure 5 ( c )) .
contrastingly , the macroporous spaces in the hgcs + mapcs were filled with newly formed bone tissue ( figure 5 ( d )) .
the importance of cells in repairing bone lesions has been documented [ 16 , 18 , 23 ] .
in this study we confirm that nbf with hgcs scaffolds also relies on the ability of cells to increase regional bone regeneration , especially in the central area of the csds apart from host tissue ( figure 5 ( c )) .
the percentage of nbf in the decbm group was significantly lower than that of the hgcs scaffold alone at 12 weeks ( figure 5 ( b )) .
notably the empty group also promoted nbf above that of decbm group ( figure 6 ( e )) .
both the empty and hgcs groups relied on the host bone as a cell source .
the host cells may have produced approximately 23 % of nbf when there was an available space ( either defect or scaffold bridging ) .
there was an absence of nbf between decbm and host tissue with intervening fibrous tissue .
in the middle of section , the nbf was slightly formed along the outer surface of the decbm with little osteointegration ( figures 5 and 6 ) .
this demonstrates that decbm of calvarial bone does not allow cell infiltration .
in figure 6 , micro - ct analysis shows 3d reconstructed calvaria at 12 weeks after implantation ( a to d ) .
the percentage of radiopaque area in the defect was calculated ( e ) .
while the decbm group showed the highest radiopaque area ( 94.1 +/ - 0.31 %) , the hgcs + mapcs scaffolds revealed greater radiopaque areas ( 90.58 +/ - 0.98 %) than hgcs scaffolds alone ( 64.76 +/ - 5.53 %) or empty defects ( 54.7 +/ - 0.79 %) .
the micro - ct data , except for the decbm group , were consistent with the histological measurements providing an indirect validation of nbf .
the reason for the decbm group difference is due to the decbm having the same inorganic matrix content as natural bone ( figure 6 ) , making it difficult to differentiate newly formed bone from decbm radiographically .
taken together , our in vivo analyses confirmed that hgcs is stiff enough to support porous spaces for cell ingrowth and is compatible with mapcs for osteogenic differentiation .
the use of hgcs + mapcs could facilitate new bone formation and further advance the success of bone regeneration .
although decbm showed a higher osteogenic differentiation potential than hgcs in vitro , its application as 3d structural scaffold is limited due to the inability for cellular migration into the compact structure of bone .
4. conclusion our data support that hgcs possesses osteoinductive properties as a novel synthetic biomaterial for bone regeneration and that seeding it with mapcs yields a synergic effect to enhance bone regeneration in rat calvarial critical - sized defects .
this study also confirms that the natural biomaterial , decbm , is not suitable as a bone scaffold .
our findings suggest that further studies are needed to adapt optimal microarchitectures of hgcs to promote bone regeneration and to find alternative applications of decbm as a scaffold in bone regeneration .

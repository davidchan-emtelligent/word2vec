objectives our work aims to study the incidence of urinary tract infections due to bmr in a university hospital .
methods microbiological monitoring was conducted in three inpatient wards of a university hospital from april to october 2012 and concerned only diagnostic urinalysis .
results during the study period , 123 patients were followed up and 79 urine samples were made corresponding to 56.4 % of all diagnostic samples .
the average age of patients was 55 +/ - 21.22 and sex ratio of 0.97 .
thirty - nine percent of patients were admitted with a neurological disorder .
these patients were referred by another health facility ( 56.3 %) came from home ( 34.4 %) or had undergone internal transfer ( 9.4 %) .
the attack rate of urinary tract infections was 3.96 .
these urinary tract infections were of nosocomial acquisition in 56 cases ( 78.9 %) with an average delay of 12.75 days .
the bacteria isolated were enterobacteriaceae 61 ( 77.2 %) , non - fermenting gram - negative bacilli 14 ( 17.7 %) and staphylococci 4 ( 5.1 %) .
in order of frequency , these were escherichia coli 25 ( 31.6 %) , klebsiella pneumoniae 21 ( 26.6 %) , pseudomonas 8 ( 10.2 %) and enterobacter 5 ( 6.3 %) .
we found 32 strains ( 40.5 %) producing extended - spectrum beta - lactamase ( esbl ) and 2 strains ( 2.5 %) of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin ( mrsa ). from urinary tract infections associated with esbl enterobacteriaceae urinary catheter was potentially the source of infection in 18 cases .
bmr attack rate was 1.80 per 100 admissions and the incidence rate of 1.99 bmr for 1000 days patients .
to wane , 18 patients or 30 % died .
conclusion the decrease in the incidence of nosocomial urinary tract infections must be accompanied by antibiotic stewardship and a strict hygiene policy .

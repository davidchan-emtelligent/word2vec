background : the aim of our study was to assess the role of laser polarimetry and visual evoked potentials ( vep ) as potential biomarkers of disease progression in multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .
participants : a total of 41 patients with ms ( 82 eyes ) and 22 age - related healthy volunteers ( 44 eyes ) completed the study .
ms patients were divided into two groups , one ( on ) with a history of optic neuritis ( 17 patients , 34 eyes ) and another group ( non ) without it ( 24 patients , 48 eyes ) .
the ms patients and controls underwent laser polarimetry ( gdx ) examination of the retinal nerve fiber layer ( rnfl ) .
in the ms group , we also examined : kurtzke " expanded disability status scale " ( edss ) , the duration of the disorder , vep - latency and amplitude , and conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
our results were statistically analyzed using anova , mann - whitney , and spearman correlation analyses .
results : in the ms group , brain atrophy and new t2 brain lesions in mri correlated with both vep latencies and amplitudes .
separate comparisons revealed vep latency testing to be less sensitive in on than in non - patients .
in on patients , vep amplitudes correlated mildly with brain atrophy ( r = - 0.15 ) and strongly with brain new mri lesions ( r = - 0.8 ) .
in non - patients , highly significant correlation of new mri brain lesions with vep latencies ( r = 0.63 , r = 0.6 ) and amplitudes ( r = - 0.3 , r = - 4.2 ) was found .
edss also correlated with brain atrophy in this group ( r = 0.5 ) .
our study did not find a correlation of gdx measures with mri tests .
the gdx method was not able to detect whole brain demyelinization and the degeneration process , but was only able to reveal the involvement of optic nerves in on and non - patients .
conclusion : in our study , we found that both methods ( vep and gdx ) can be used for the detection of optic nerve damage , but vep was found to be superior in evaluating whole brain demyelinization and axonal degeneration .
both vep and mri , but not gdx , have an important role in monitoring disease progression in ms patients , independent of the on history .
vep laser polarimetry of optic nerve mri multiple sclerosis demyelinization and axonal degeneration introduction multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is characterized as a progressive inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system in which axonal destruction occurs at early stages and is responsible for the accumulation of irreversible disability ( kuhlmann et al. , 2002 ) .
the proposed mechanisms of axonal degeneration in ms are considered to vary depending on the stage of the disease .
during the early stages of disorder , axonal injury correlates with the magnitude of the inflammation .
it has been proposed that in the later stages , accumulation of tissue damage and loss of remyelination cause irreversible disability ( kuhlmann et al. , 2002 ) .
defining the subclinical progression of the disorder is very challenging .
standard clinical end points such as expanded disability status scale ( edss ) provide an indication of ms activity , but do not always reveal early neurodegeneration changes .
in recent years , axonal damage and disease progression markers have been tested for use in monitoring the early subclinical changes , since existing methods have not been proved sensitive enough in evaluating the disorder .
in the future , short - lasting , highly available , and easy - performed methods are expected to be available .
in our study , we focused on ophthalmological and electrophysiological tests .
scanning laser polarimetry ( gdx ) with variable corneal compensation ( vcc ) is a non - invasive imaging technique based on the projection of polarized near - infrared light and its retardation , when propagating through a birefringent medium - i.e. , retinal nerve fiber layer ( rnfl ) .
it can detect changes resulting from axonal cytoskeleton disorganization .
gdx measures both the thickness and integrity of rnfl .
the potential of gdx to measure the rnfl is considered to be comparable to that of optic coherence tomography ( oct ) ( zaveri et al. , 2008 ; galleta and balcer , 2011 ) .
electrophysiological tests , including visual evoked potentials ( vep ) , are among the newer approaches to examination that are to be further investigated .
nowadays , they are considered to be complementary to the clinical measurement of somatosensory functions .
vep plays a useful role in the detection of early subclinical changes of nerve tract demyelinization .
it may have a role similar to structural measures in detecting , and hence monitoring the signs of early axonal destruction .
here , we compare vep and gdx with conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) to determine which of these markers is most suitable to detect whole brain demyelinization and axonal degeneration in ms. subjects and methods patients patients with ms and disease - free patients ( controls ) participated in the study of the visual function and the neuronal integrity of the rnfl .
ms patients were divided into two groups , one ( on ) with history of optic neuritis ( 17 patients , 34 eyes ) and another group ( non ) without it ( 24 patients , 48 eyes ) .
a total of 45 patients with ms were recruited from patients treated in the ms centre at university hospital in martin , slovakia .
the inclusion criterion for enrollment of on patients was the history of optic neuritis for at least 3 months prior to the date of study entry .
four of them were excluded from the group : one patient had an amblyopic eye , three had moderate to severe loss of visual acuity and difficulty concentrating during the ophthalmologic examination .
the remaining 17 on patients were enrolled .
non - patients were randomly selected from the patients of the ms centre .
out of the enrolled ms patients , 90 % ( n = 37 ) had a relapse - remitting course of the disorder , two had a secondary progressive course , and two were diagnosed as having a clinically isolated syndrome .
at the time of the examination , the patients were undergoing treatment by immunomodulatory agents ( interferon beta , glatiramer acetate , or intravenous methylprednisolone ) .
these treatments complied with the authorized recommendations for ms treatment in the slovak republic .
the mean length of treatment at the time of entry into the study was 4.01 +/ - 2.8 years ( p = 0.14 between on and non ) .
the control group consisted of 22 age - related disease - free persons with no history of visual problems and no evidence of demyelinization disorder .

clinical and paraclinical examinations patients routine neurological and neurophysiological examinations were performed on patients in the ms group .
complete visual function tests were supplemented with gdx analysis .
optic neuritis was confirmed by ophthalmological examination including a visual acuity test , a color vision test , and fundoscopic examination of the retina and the optic disk .
episodes of optic neuritis were found to have occurred with the same frequency in both left and right eyes .
the duration of disease was recorded in all participants .
edss and ophthalmology testing were performed at the same sessions .
conventional mri 1.5 t scans had been performed annually since the date of diagnosis .
at the time of study entry , new mri scans were performed to evaluate the range of brain atrophy .
t2 , t1 , flair , and proton density - weighted imaging ( pd - weighted images ) were used .
the measurement of brain atrophy ( level of neurodegeneration ) was performed with semi - automated radiological protocol based on the manual segmentation technique .
semi - automated edge detection contouring - thresholding technique was manually corrected for the region of interest .
the progression of brain volume loss was detected after comparison with previously measured values .
brain atrophy was determined longitudinally by serial mri in each individual patient .
the final results were affirmed by a radiologist either as positive ( presence of brain atrophy ) or negative ( brain atrophy not found ) .
comparison of new t2 hyperintense lesions on follow - up scans with the baseline measurements provided evidence for the intensity of inflammation .
the presence of two or more new lesions in the current t2 - weighted mri was interpreted as a positive sign of active inflammation .
mri measurements were made at the same time as vep and gdx and evidence of lesions .
a myoquick isa 1800 ep from micromed was used for vep p100 waves examination .
latency and amplitude of p100 waves were individually judged .
the control group of 22 age - related disease - free subjects underwent ophthalmological tests .
retinal nerve fiber layer measurement patients with ms and controls underwent measurement of the rnfl thickness for both eyes using gdx with vcc ( software version 5.5.1 , 2005 carl zeiss meditec ) .
these scans were centered on the optic disk using a scan circle of 3.2 mm ; the mean of three separate measurements was used .
the temporal - superior - nasal - inferior - temporal average rnfl thickness was used as the summary parameter for gdx .
rnfl pathology was assessed by an ophthalmologist trained in gdx analysis .
statistical analysis analyses were performed using ncss - statistical and power analysis software 2007 and stat .
differences across all groups were assessed using anova tests , which were applied for the determination of differences between the data of the patient and control groups .
the relationship between healthy and ms eyes was examined by mann - whitney test , separately for both on and non - groups .
spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship of mri measures with vep parameters , rnfl thickness , edss , and disease duration .
statistical methods were consulted with peter slezak from bio - med - stat center ( faculty of mathematics , physics , and informatics , comenius university in bratislava ) .
results in the on group , both brain atrophy and mri brain new lesions correlated with lower vep amplitudes .
this correlation was found only in the right eye .
we did not find any significant association of vep latency and brain atrophy or new brain lesions in mri .
both disease duration and age of patients significantly correlated with brain atrophy measures , but we did not find this relationship with new mri brain lesions .
edss score was also related to brain atrophy but not to new mri brain lesions .
the results are shown in table 2a .

in patients without a history of on ( non ) , vep parameters showed even stronger association with both mri new brain lesions and brain atrophy than in on group .
we found a significant but moderate relationship of new brain t2 lesions with longer latencies of vep in the left and right eyes .
we also found correlation of vep amplitudes and mri new brain lesions .
vep latency delay correlated significantly with duration of disorder .
edss values correlated with brain atrophy and also mildly with mri new brain lesions .
in this group , association of rnfl thickness and brain atrophy was proved for the left eye .
mri brain atrophy correlated with disease duration .
results are shown in table 2b .
multiple sclerosis patients from both groups did not differ in many parameters such as age ( p = 0.12 ) , duration of disorder ( p = 0.32 ) , duration of treatment ( p = 0.12 ) , edss ( p = 0.32 ) , vep latency right ( p = 0.3 ) , vep amplitude right ( p = 0.67 ) , vep amplitude left ( p = 0.7 ) , rnfl thickness right ( p = 0.6 ) and left ( p = 0.3 ) , and nerve fiber indicator ( nfi ) right ( p = 0.97 ) and nfi left ( p = 0.3 ) .
the only difference found was in vep latency in left eyes ( p = 0.01 ) .
this fact encouraged us to evaluate both ms groups together .
both brain atrophy and new mri brain lesions have shown stronger correlation with vep results than with gdx rnfl measures .
brain atrophy correlated with vep latencies of the right eyes of the ms patients , but not of the left ones .
a significant correlation of vep latencies and vep amplitudes with new brain lesions in mri was found in right and left eyes .
the results are described in tables 3a,b. table 3 ( a ) correlation of vep latency and mri brain atrophy , mri brain new lesions in all ms patients ; ( b ) correlation of vep amplitudes and mri brain atrophy , mri brain new lesions in all ms patients .

vep lat = latency of visual evoked potential , vep ampl = amplitude of visual evoked potential , mri atrophy = presence of brain atrophy , mri brain new lesions = t2 hyperintense new brain lesions .
a relationship was observed in vep latencies and edss scores in right and left eyes .
amplitudes of vep did not match with edss ( table 4 ) .

vep lat = latency of visual evoked potential , vep ampl = amplitude of visual evoked potential .
when compared with healthy controls , statistical analysis showed reduction of rnfl measured by gdx of optic nerve ms eyes .
the results were supported by the measurement of nfi , which serves as a comparator of normal and damaged peripapillary nerve fibers .
higher levels of nfi indicate advanced impairment of optic nerve fibers .
nfi values of ms patients were higher and significantly different from values of healthy controls .
results of average rnfl thicknesses are shown in table 5 .

despite the significant difference in gdx rnfl of ms and healthy eyes , neither mri brain atrophy nor new mri brain lesions correlated with gdx rnfl thickness and nfi in the ms group .
gdx rnfl measures correlated with vep latencies , but not with vep amplitudes .
we did not confirm any association between rnfl thickness and disease duration .
the results are in table 6 .

discussion many studies have shown the presence of alteration of the visual system in ms as a possible method to test its subclinical progression ( sisto et al. , 2005 ; zaveri et al. , 2008 ; pueyo et al. , 2010 ) .
there are different opinions as to which examination is the most appropriate .
in several studies , two or more tests were performed on the same sample of patients to increase the overall sensitivity .
only a few studies have reported mri correlations with gdx and vep ( frohman et al. , 2009 ) .
in our study , vep tests have been found to be more sensitive than gdx .
there was a reduction in vep amplitude in a group of patients with axonal damage ( mri brain atrophy ) or active conduction block due to focal demyelinization ( new t2 brain lesions in mri ) , while vep latencies remained abnormal in a group of patients with diffuse demyelinization and also with extensive axonal damage ( vep p100 correlated with mri new t2 lesion and brain atrophy ) .
separate comparisons have revealed the vep latency testing to be less sensitive in on than non - patients in detecting axonal damage .
in on patients , vep amplitude was linked to brain atrophy and also to new mri brain lesions , but only in the right eye of subjects .
we explain this by the fact that the residual axonal deficit was more pronounced in the right than in the left eye .
axonal degeneration seems to be non - equally implicated in optic nerves .
in on group , recovery from optic neuritis was less prominent in the right than in the left eye .
on the other hand , positive vep tests in non - group have confirmed capability of vep to reveal silent demyelinization and brain atrophy processes .
magnetic resonance imaging was not aimed at detecting optic nerve involvement , and we did not use specific orbital short t1 inversion recovery ( stir ) sequences for optic nerve evaluation .
in that situation , mri outcomes reflected intensive demyelinization and axonal degeneration of brain without determination of pre - and retrochiasmatic processes .
therefore , our results support the importance of both methods , vep and mri , in disease progression control .
number of t2 lesions is considered to be a weak predictor of disability in ms ( barkhof , 1999 ) .
in non - group of our patients , edss values mildly correlated with new brain mri t2 lesions .
this association reflected activity of the disorder .
at the time of the examination , the patients were undergoing treatment by first line immunomodulatory agents , but many of them were shifted to another first line or second line medication in the following 12 - month period ( 45 % from non - group ) .
mri is traditionally used to monitor disease progression .
some authors have also reported the important role of vep in the prediction of the disability progression ( trip et al. , 2007 ; klistorner et al. , 2011 ) .
frederiksen et al. compared the sensitivity of mri and electrophysiological tests ( vep and somatosensory evoked potential ) .
the combination of these methods revealed abnormalities in 63 % of the patients , but only monosymptomatic subacute optic neuritis patients were tested .
in this 1 - year follow - up study , the mean latency of vep in patients with optic neuritis was longer in clinically definite ms patients ( fredericsen et al. , 1991 ) .
the strong correlation of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands with vep and multifocal mri ( p < 0.0000 ) in patients following optic neuritis reflects the activity of the demyelinization processes , as it was found by horwitz et al. the authors proposed performing vep and mri examinations before deciding on a lumbar puncture , due to the high predictive role of both methods .
their patients who had normal vep and mri findings had a 96 % probability of oligoclonal bands - negative cerebrospinal fluid values obtained by lumbar puncture samples ( horwitz et al. , 2012 ) .
based on vep , mri , perimetry , and contrast sensitivity tests , sisto et al. reported a large prevalence of visual pathway involvement in patients affected by ms with no history of optic neuritis and no visual symptoms .
despite low specificity , the tests were sensitive enough to reflect inflammation and subsequent degeneration of cns , even in patients without history of optic neuritis .
the usefulness of the combination of multiple examinations in the detection of nearly all cases of visual pathway involvement was emphasized ( sisto et al. , 2005 ) .
in our work , the predictive prognostic value of vep has been proved by positive association of vep latencies and edss in on and non ms patients .
other reported data suggest that vep and multimodal evoked potentials may be more sensitive than clinical and mri measures in detecting disease evolution .
transversal and longitudinal studies by leocani demonstrated good correlation between evoked potentials abnormalities and disability .
multimodal evoked potentials abnormality score correlated significantly with edss and mri in transversal evaluation ( leocani et al. , 2000 ) .
we found a significant thinning of the nerve fiber layer in the retina in all patients treated for ms , compared with healthy volunteers .
other authors found similar results ( della mea et al. , 2007 ; pueyo et al. , 2008 , 2010 ; zaveri et al. , 2008 ) .
our study did not find a significant correlation of gdx measures and mri tests , except for a mild association of rnfl thickness of the left non - eye with mri brain atrophy .
the gdx method was not able to detect whole brain demyelinization and degeneration processes , but revealed only the involvement of optic nerves in on and non - patients .
advanced mri techniques can provide explicit information ; some studies have documented their sensitivity ( sipman et al. , 2010 ) .
frohman et al. compared non - conventional mri techniques ( magnetization transfer ratio and diffusion tensor imaging ) with oct and gdx vcc parameters .
they found that the association of oct - measured rnfl thickness with brain mri measures was stronger than with gdx - measured rnfl thickness ( frohman et al. , 2009 ) .
zimmermann et al .
( 2012 ) referred to oct rnfl as a parameter of neuro - axonal damage comparably linked to white and gray matter atrophy .
a significant correlation between magnetization transfer ratio ( mtr ) , measures of axonal loss by oct - rnfl thickness , and vep amplitude was referred by trip et al .
( 2007 ) .
whole - optic nerve mtr correlated modestly with central - field vep latency , but strongly with lesion - only mtr measures .
while latency delay correlated significantly with mtr , correlation became non - significant when adjusted for the degree of axonal loss ( trip et al. , 2007 ; klistorner et al. , 2011 ) .
the use of non - conventional mri techniques in monitoring patients in clinical practice is not widely advisable at the moment .
all these techniques still need to be evaluated for sensitivity and specificity in detecting tissue damage in ms and its changes over time ( filippi et al. , 2011 ) .
conventional mri is a widely available diagnostic tool in clinical practice .
our findings highlight the usefulness of conventional mri in the evaluation of ms progression .
mri may still be a good biomarker for ms evolution .
in our ms patients , rnfl measures correlated with vep latencies but not with vep amplitudes .
the association of prolonged vep latencies with rnfl thinning was also shown by pueyo et al .
( 2008 ) .
other authors have found a correlation of vep amplitudes with rnfl thinning , or no relationship , but only under oct results ( parisi et al. , 1999 ) .
naismith et al. considered vep to be relatively more sensitive than oct in detecting cases with mild to moderate visual deficit .
they provided results of a retrospective study with 65 subjects with systematical evaluation of oct and vep in ms patients with history of optic neuritis >= 6 months prior to enrollment .
they found that oct identified rnfl thinning in 60 % of eyes with previous on , and in about 20 % of subclinically affected eyes .
positive results of vep were detected in 81 % ( naismith et al. , 2009 ) .
pueyo et al .
( 2010 ) showed that gdx can be as accurate as oct and their measurement significantly correlated with vep p100 latencies .
correlations of gdx and vep results were described by della mea et al .
( 2007 ) .
they found standard automated perimetry and vep to be more sensitive to axonal defects in rnfl than gdx in ms. in contrast , a prospective study of patients with ms showed gdx to be superior to functional ophthalmological and neurophysiological tests ( garcia - martin et al. , 2010 ) .
conclusion in our study , we found that both vep and gdx can be used as supplementary methods in detection of optic nerve damage .
we confirmed the superiority of vep over gdx in evaluating whole brain demyelinization and axonal degeneration .
both vep and mri , but not gdx , have an important role in monitoring disease progression in ms patients , independently of the on history .
the importance of vep was supported by its significant correlation with mri measures and edss values .

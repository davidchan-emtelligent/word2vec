appear to have been well codified indications , contraindications , and surgical techniques related to unicompartmental arthroplasty .
the data in the literature show that the selection criteria can be divided into general origin factors ( age , weight , activity level ) and local factors , more closely related to the joint to be treated [ 1,2 ] .
the patient 's age over 65 years and the functional requirements of a sedentary activity comparable to justify its use in elderly patients with clinical signs and imaging involvement of only one of the joint compartments [ 3 ] .
we agree , however , with those who recommend its use in older subjects , since it is well tolerated , with low morbidity , reduced blood loss , better preservation of the joint and saving of bone tissue .
other advantages include lower costs , shorter hospitalization , faster rehabilitation and conferment of a greater than pre - op functional efficiency that fully meets the needs of elderly patients .
the authors report their experience in 12 patients treated surgically implanting a unicompartmental prosthesis .
materials and methods we evaluated 12 unicompartmental tibiofemoral joint prosthesis ( 2 lateral and 10 medial ) from 2010 to 2012. of all patients ( 7 f and 5 m ) , mean age 72 years ( range 57 - 88 ) , we analyzed in the pre - operative , the of lower limb alignment on an examination of full standing radiographs .
we considered it appropriate to perform radiographs in 45 degrees of flexion under load ( projection rosenberg ) and axial patella ( merchant view ) to exclude the involvement of other joint compartments .
for the evaluation of the clinical results we used the knee society score ( kss ) , the womac score and the sf - 36 for quality of life .
all the patients were operated with a medial approach for the medial uka implants and a lateral approach for the lateral ukas .
a tourniquet was used in all cases except one patient with severe arterial vessel disease .
all patients received antibiotic treatment ( second generation cephalosporin ) and an anticoagulant treatment ( low - molecular - weight heparin ) .
results in all patients , we prescribed a standard rehabilitation protocol .
range of motion was satisfactorily increased .
the mean flexion was 110 degrees with significant improvement in pain symptoms joint .
pain at extreme rom values was also reduced .
improvement was most evident during walking : increase in the free perimeter and a decrease in pain intensity .
the subjective result was very satisfactory for 7 patients ( 58 %) , satisfactory for 4 patients ( 34 %) , unsatisfactory in 1 case ( 8 %) .
discussion and conclusion the unicompartmental prosthesis for the treatment of both medial and lateral overload has reached a considerable degree of reliability mainly due to the experience of the surgeon and to indications .
the unicompartmental prosthesis therefore stands as an alternative surgical solution to total knee arthroplasty offering some definite advantages among which are the preservation of bone stock , minimally invasive surgery , lower costs and shorter hospitalization [ 1,2,4 ]. from the point of view of functional recovery rehabilitation is faster with good results already in the immediate post - operative .

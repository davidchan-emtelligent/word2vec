background playing a strategic role in the host immune function , the intestinal microbiota has been recently hypothesized to be involved in the etiology of atopy .
in order to investigate the gastrointestinal microbial ecology of atopic disease , here we performed a pilot comparative molecular analysis of the faecal microbiota in atopic children and healthy controls .
results nineteen atopic children and 12 healthy controls aged 4 - 14 years were enrolled .
stools were collected and the faecal microbiota was characterized by means of the already developed phylogenetic microarray platform , htf - microbi.array , and quantitative pcr .
the intestinal microbiota of atopic children showed a significant depletion in members of the clostridium cluster iv , faecalibacterium prausnitzii , akkermansia muciniphila and a corresponding increase of the relative abundance of enterobacteriaceae .
conclusion depleted in key immunomodulatory symbionts , the atopy - associated microbiota can represent an inflammogenic microbial consortium which can contribute to the severity of the disease .
our data open the way to the therapeutic manipulation of the intestinal microbiota in the treatment of atopy by means of pharmaceutical probiotics .
background atopic diseases are chronic inflammatory disorders caused by an aberrant t - helper ( th2 ) - type immune response against common and innocuous environmental antigens [ 1 ] .
the elaboration of cytokines , such as interleukin ( il ) - 4 , il - 13 and il - 5 , can contribute to disease induction [ 2 ] .
during the past decades the prevalence of atopic diseases among children in the western world has dramatically increased [ 2 ] .
too fast for any possible shift in genetic constitution , environmental changes associated with the western lifestyle are believed to be involved [ 3,4 ] .
the human intestinal microbial community has been indicated as a key factor to interpret the impact of the western lifestyle on the etiology of atopic diseases [ 3 - 7 ] .
the intestinal microbiota is extremely plastic in response to diet and environmental factors and , at the same time , governs many aspects of the immune function throughout the body [ 8 ] .
thus , the hypothesis that specific western lifestyle - driven dysbioses of the human intestinal microbiota are involved in the bloom of atopy in western children has been advanced .
the human intestinal microbiota consists of a total amount of 1014 microbial cells differentiated in more than 500 different species [ 9 ] .
showing a tremendous metabolic potential , this versatile microbial " organ " exerts a role of primary importance for our metabolism .
recently , the strategic role of the intestinal microbiota in the development , education and functionality of the human innate and adaptive immune system has been recognized [ 7,10 ] .
according to gaboriau - routhiau et al. [ 11 ] , specific members of the intestinal microbial community exert an active role in the modulation of a striking range of t cell functions , such as th17 , th1 , th2 and regulatory cell phenotype ( t regs ) .
having a profound impact on the overall human immune status , perturbations of the intestinal microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of inflammatory diseases , such as inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibd ) , autoimmune disorders , allergy and type ii diabetes [ 12,13 ] .
on the basis of the perceived importance of the intestinal microbiota in the education of the human immune system to tolerance [ 5 ] , culture - independent perspective studies have been carried out to determine whether specific microbiota dysbioses in the early life could affect the subsequent manifestation and sensitization of atopic diseases .
in the lifestyle and genetic constitution ( koala ) birth cohort study - an extensive epidemiological study with involved 957 infants from netherlands aged 1 month - the presence of escherichia coli and clostridium difficile in stools has been associated with a higher risk to develop eczema [ 14 ] .
even if the health - promoting microbiota components bifidobacterium and lactobacillus have been suggested as possible protective factors against the risk to develop atopy [ 15,16 ] , no differences in the prevalence of these probiotic genera between infants with and without allergic disorders have been detected [ 3,14,17,18 ] .
more recently , two perspective surveys of the intestinal microbiota in danish and swedish infants have been carried out with a longitudinal approach , sampling the faecal microbiota at different time points during the first year of life [ 19,20 ] .
based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( dgge ) and 16s rdna 454 - pyrosequencing , respectively , these robust and extensive studies proved that the low bacterial diversity in the early life , rather than the prevalence of a specific bacterial taxon , is associated with an increased risk of subsequent atopic disease , reinforcing the " old friend hypothesis " [ 21 ] .
according to this theory , the western lifestyle caused the disappearance of key bacterial groups from the intestinal microbiota , which are essential to prime the physiology of our immune system .
the lack of these " old friends " during the perinatal period led to an immune system incline to inappropriate activation , which is a characteristic of the emerging chronic inflammatory diseases in the western world .
even if the role of the intestinal microbiota in the predisposition to develop atopy in infancy has been accepted , to our knowledge , only few case - control culture - independent studies of the gastrointestinal microbial ecology in atopic diseases have been carried out .
however , by modulating the immune status throughout the body [ 8 ] , an inflammogenic gut microbial community in atopic subjects could significantly contribute to the severity of the disease .
in this perspective we performed a pilot case - control study of the atopy - associated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in atopic children .
since from birth to weaning the infant intestinal microbiota is an extremely dynamic entity , which continuously fluctuates in response to factors of environmental and endogenous origin [ 22 ] , we enrolled children aged > 2 years , characterized by a relatively stable adult - like intestinal microbial community [ 23 ] .
in particular , the faecal microbiota of 19 atopic children and 12 healthy controls aged 4 - 14 years was characterized by means of the previously developed phylogenetic microarray platform high taxonomic fingerprint ( htf ) - microbi.array [ 24 ] and quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) .
integrated of an additional probe pair for akkermansia muciniphila , the htf - microbi.array platform detects up to 31 intestinal bacterial groups and covers up to 95 % of the human intestinal microbiota [ 25 ] .
for our study faeces were selected since they represent the only realistic and reliable sample for a non - invasive study of the human intestinal microbiota .
methods subjects enrolled and study groups we enrolled 19 children ( referred as atopics throughout the paper ) with clinical diagnosis of allergy ( rhinitis , asthma , grass pollen sensitization , allergic atopic dermatitis , oral allergy syndrome , cow 's milk allergy ) and encountering all the following criteria : ( i ) delivered naturally at term , ( ii ) breast fed for at least 3 months , ( iii ) aged between 4 and 14 years , ( iv ) no acute diseases for at least 2 weeks , ( v ) no antibiotic treatment in the last 3 months .
in particular , 17 children presented allergic rhinitis , in 4 cases associated with asthma .
atopic dermatitis was observed in 8 cases of which 6 associated with rhinitis and inhalant sensitization and 1 with food allergy ( table 1 ) .
during the visit the children underwent a clinical evaluation and skin prick test for main food or inhalant allergens .
total and specific ige determination was performed when clinically necessary .
fresh stool samples were collected within 3 days .
as controls , 12 non - allergic children who encountered the same criteria above described but without family history of atopy were enrolled .
all the children were routinely followed by the paediatric oncology and haematology unit lalla seragnoli , sant'orsola - malpighi hospital , university of bologna .
parents provided a written informed consent .
approval by the ethics committee of the sant'orsola - malpighi hospital was not needed for this study .

dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) total dna from faecal material was extracted using qiaamp dna stool mini kit ( qiagen ) according to the modified protocol reported by candela et al. [ 24 ] .
final dna concentration was determined using nanodrop nd - 1000 ( nanodrop technologies ) .
pcr amplifications were performed with biometra thermal cycler t gradient ( biometra ) .
the 16 s rrna gene was amplified using universal forward primer 27 f and reverse primer r1492 , following the protocol described by candela et al. [ 24 ] .
pcr products were purified by using the wizard sv gel and pcr clean - up system kit ( promega ) , eluted in 20 mul of sterile water and quantified with the dna 7500 labchip assay kit and bioanalyzer 2100 ( agilent technologies ) .
all the oligonucleotide primers used for pcr reactions and probe pairs employed for the array construction were synthesized by thermo electron .
htf - microbi.array analysis the htf - microbi.array utilized in this study is based on the ligase detection reaction - universal array ( ldr - ua ) approach [ 28 ] and enables specific detection and quantification of the 16 s rrna from 31 phylogenetically related groups of the human intestinal microbiota ( additional file 1 ) .
the original htf - microbi.array [ 24 ] was updated to include a probe for the detection of a. muciniphila .
the new probe was designed and validated as reported by candela et al. [ 24 ] ( additional file 2 ) .
sequences of the entire probe set of the htf - microbi.array are reported in additional file 3 .

two hundred and fifty fmol of synthetic template ( 5 ' - agccgcgaacaccacgatcgaccggcgcgcgcagctgcagcttgctcatg - 3 ) were used for normalization purposes .
all htf - microbi.array experiments were performed in independent duplicates .
data analysis all arrays were scanned and processed according to the protocol and parameters already described by candela et al. [ 24 ] .
fluorescence intensities ( if ) were normalized on the basis of the synthetic ligation control signal : ( a ) outlier values ( 2.5 - fold above or below the average ) were discarded ; ( b ) a correction factor was calculated in order to set the average if of the ligation control to 50000 ( n = 6 ) ; ( c ) the correction factor was applied to both the probes and background if values .
reproducibility of the experiments was assessed by calculating pearson 's correlation of the fluorescence signals between the two replicates .

the diagnosis of atopy was considered as a dummy environmental variable .
as shown in figure 1a , the principal components pc2 and pc3 , which collectively represented only a minor fraction of the total variance ( 9.7 %) , resulted in the separation of samples according to the health status .
in order to identify the bacterial lineages showing differences in abundance between atopics and controls , probe fluorescence signals obtained from the htf - microbi.array in atopics and controls were compared by box plot analysis ( additional file 6 ) .

on the basis of the htf - microbi.array fluorescence data , the relative contribution of the major phyla in atopics and controls was calculated ( figure 2 ) .
at high taxonomic level , atopics and controls showed a comparable overall phylogenetic composition of the faecal microbiota .
indeed , their microbiota resulted largely dominated by bacteroidetes and firmicutes , which together accounted for up to 90 % of the faecal microbial community. with a relative abundance ranging from 1 to 5 % , fusobacteria , actinobacteria and proteobacteria were sub - dominant components .
however , focusing at lower taxonomic level , significant differences in the relative contribution of certain microbial groups were detected .
in particular , atopics were characterized by a lower relative contribution of members of the clostridium cluster iv ( atopics , 20.9 % - controls , 28.7 % ; p = 0.01 ) and a concomitant relative increase in enterobacteriaceae ( atopics , 2.4 % - controls , 1.2 % ; p = 0.009 ) and fusobacteria ( atopics , 1.9 % - controls , 1.2 % ; p = 0.001 ) .

the abundance of f. prausnitzii , a. muciniphila , enterobacteriaceae , clostridium cluster iv , bifidobacterium and lactobacillus group in the faecal microbiota of atopics and controls was investigated by qpcr analysis of the 16 s rrna gene .
as reported in table 3 , respect to healthy controls , atopics were significantly depleted in f. prausnitzii , a. muciniphila and members of the clostridium cluster iv , and tended to be depleted in bifidobacterium and enriched in enterobacteriaceae .

correlation among faecal microbiota , diagnosis of allergy and total ige in order to investigate whether the profile of the faecal microbial community of atopics correlated with their allergy profile ( table 1 ) , a pca of the htf - microbi.array fluorescence signals from atopics was carried out .
pca was performed by considering the types of allergic response as dummy environmental variables .
no separation of the atopic children according to the specific diagnosis of rhinitis , asthma , grass pollen sensitization , allergic atopic dermatitis , oral allergy syndrome and cow 's milk allergy was obtained , proving that the atopy - related dysbioses of the faecal microbiota are independent of the specific atopic outcome ( data not shown ) .
in a subset of 10 atopy cases with clinical relevance the total serum ige levels were determined .
total ige ranged from 138 to 855 ku / l ( geometric mean : 326 ku / l ) , a value above the normal for age [ 27 ] .
in order to investigate whether in this subset of 10 atopics ige correlated with the relative abundance of a specific microbial group in the faeces , spearman rank correlation coefficients between the probe relative fluorescence signals and the ige levels were calculated .
according to our data no significant correlation was determined .
however , a tendency towards an inverse correlation with ige was obtained for l. casei et rel .
( rho = 0.52 ; p = 0.100 ) , while clostridium cluster ix abundance tended to be positively correlated with total ige ( rho = 0.60 ; p = 0.073 ) ( figure 3 ) .

discussion in the present paper we combined two culture - independent molecular approaches , htf - microbi.array and qpcr , for a pilot characterization of the atopy - associated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in 19 atopic children living in italy .
at high phylogenetic level both atopics and controls showed a comparable overall microbiota profile where firmicutes and bacteroidetes constituted the two dominant divisions .
however , focusing at lower taxonomic level , the intestinal microbiota of atopic children was characterized by a significant depletion in members of the clostridium cluster iv , f. prausnitzii , a. muciniphila and a corresponding increase of the relative abundance of enterobacteriaceae .
in a case - control dgge - based study of the faecal microbiota from 20 allergic and 20 non - allergic 5 - year - old estonian children , stsepetova et al. [ 36 ] reported a less diverse composition in the faecal microbiota from atopic children but , according to the authors , no bacterial targets could distinguish infants with or without atopy .
however , the dgge - based approach allowed to consider only the dominant fraction of the intestinal microbiota , remaining blind with respect to the whole phylogenetic complexity of the ecosystem .
in an elegant 16 s rdna pyrosequencing - based dynamic study , hong et al. [ 37 ] addressed the differences in the microbiota succession between 3 infants with and 4 without eczema over four time points until 24 months of age .
even if age was shown to be the dominant factor mediating microbiota changes , matched by age eczema infants were characterized by a higher abundance of the enterobacteria klebsiella and shigella as well as enterococcus , while bifidobacterium showed a higher abundance in non - eczema ones .
these last data are in general agreement with the intestinal microbiota dysbioses observed in our study .
although bifidobacterium and lactobacillus have been traditionally indicated as possible protective factors against atopic disease in childhood [ 16 ] , we did not detect any significant differences in these health - promoting genera between atopics and controls , confirming previous findings reported by penders et al. [ 3,18 ] .
however , molecular studies at the species level showed a different distribution of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species between allergic and non - allergic children [ 36,38 ] , suggesting a potential species - specific effect of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in the etiology of atopic disorders .
the atopy - related microbiota dysbioses we depicted in our cohort of 19 children were independent of their peculiar allergic profile .
a subset of 10 atopics underwent clinical evaluation of total ige level and the correlation between ige and the relative abundance of specific microbial groups in the faeces was explored .
even if no significant correlation was determined , l. casei et rel. and clostridium cluster ix tended to be negatively and positively correlated with ige , respectively .
interestingly , ogawa et al. [ 39 ] demonstrated that orally administered l. casei was effective in the control of the ige levels in human allergic reactions and , recently , schiffer et al. [ 40 ] reported that l. casei could inhibit the effector phase of immune inflammation in vivo .
finally , penders et al. [ 38 ] showed a decreased risk of atopic dermatitis in children colonized by l. paracasei , a member of the l. casei et rel. group .
even if these studies may support the tendency towards inverse correlation between l. casei et rel. and ige level we observed in our study , caution must be taken in considering these data since only a low number of children were analyzed .
characterized by a decrease of the absolute levels of clostridium cluster iv , f. prausnitzii and a. muciniphila , as well as a corresponding increase in the relative abundance of enterobacteriaceae , the atopy - associated intestinal microbial community we described in this study is depleted in key immunomodulatory members of the human intestinal microbiota and possibly enriched in pro - inflammatory " pathobionts " [ 41 ]. by the specific induction of t regs , members of the clostridium cluster iv have been demonstrated to be strategic for maintaining the immune homeostasis [ 42 ] .
analogously , providing a vast range of anti - inflammatory effects , f. prausnitzii has been considered as a crucial microorganism for gut homeostasis [ 43 ] .
finally , a. muciniphila is a common member of the human intestinal tract which has been recently associated with a protective / anti - inflammatory role in healthy gut [ 44 ] .
on the other hand , enterobacteriaceae have been reported to prosper in the context of a host - mediated inflammatory response [ 45 ] .
capable to venture more deeply in the mucus layer and establish a close interaction with the epithelial surface , members of enterobacteriaceae concur in the induction of a pro - inflammatory response and further consolidate the host inflammatory status .
thus , similarly to the one characterized in ibd [ 43,46 - 48 ] , the atopy - associated microbiota can represent an inflammogenic microbial consortium which can contribute to the severity of the disease [ 7 ] .
conclusion atopic children were depleted in specific members of the intestinal microbiota that , capable to orchestrate a broad spectrum of inflammatory and regulatory t cell responses , have been reported as fundamental for the immune homeostasis .
the decrease of these key immunomodulatory symbionts in the gastrointestinal tract - as well as the corresponding increase in relative abundance of pro - inflammatory enterobacteriaceae - support the immune deregulation and , in the context of an atopic host , can sustain an inflammatory status throughout the body .
since the atopy - related dysbioses of the intestinal microbiota can contribute to the severity of the disease , atopy treatment may be facilitated by redressing these microbiological unbalances .
to this aim , advantages can be taken from the possibility to manipulate the microbiota plasticity with diet or pharmaceutical prebiotics and probiotics .
however , the phylogenetic resolution of the data reported in our study needs to be implemented by deep 16 s rdna sequencing .
moreover , metatranscriptomic studies can be carried out .
linking the phylogenetic structure of the intestinal microbiota with its specific functional activities , the metatranscriptomic characterization of the intestinal microbiota in atopic children could reveal the possible pathogenic mechanisms behind the atopy - related microbiota dysbioses .

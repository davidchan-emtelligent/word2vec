we constructed a full - ring prototype system and evaluated performances , especially imaging performance , of the prototype system in simultaneous measurement .
the prototype system consists of eight four - layer doi - pet detectors and a prototype birdcage rf - coil developed for the proposed system .
the pet detectors consist of six monolithic multi - pixel photon counter array ( s11064 - 050p ) , a readout circuit , fourlayer doi scintillator arrays and a shielding box made of 35 mum thick copper foil .
the crystal array consists of 2.0 mm x 2.0 mm x 5.0 mm lyso crystals arranged in 38 x 6 x 4 layer .
the rf - coil has eight coil elements and the eight pet detectors are positioned at each element gap .
the diameter of the rf - coil elements is 261 mm. we conducted performance tests of the prototype system with a 3.0 t mri ( magnetom verio ) .
only the pet detectors , the rf - coil and the cables were in an mri room during measurements .
a data acquisition system and power supplies for the mppcs and preamplifiers were outside the mri room and connected to all the detectors through a penetration panel .
as a result , the spatial resolutions of a na - 22 point source in the pet image were lower than 1.6 mm in whole the fov due to the doi capability .
in addition , the influence of the simultaneous measurements on the pet performance is negligible .
on the other hand , the snr of the phantom image in the magnitude images was degraded from 259.7 to 209.4 due to noise contamination from the power supplies .

our aim was to determine whether baseline measures of cognitive functioning , walking speed , and depressive status are independent predictors of limitations in instrumental activities of daily living ( iadl ) in older adults .
the cross - sectional study involved 1329 community - dwelling adults , aged 75 years or older .
at baseline , the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) , symbol digit substitution test ( sdst ) , geriatric depressive scale ( gds ) , and a word list memory task were completed , and self - reported iadls and walking speed were recorded .
the longitudinal study involved 948 participants without baseline iadl limitation , which was assessed at baseline and 15 - month follow up , using the three kihon checklist subitems .
in cross - sectional analyses , participants with iadl limitation demonstrated greater gds scores , slower walking speeds , and lower mmse , word list memory task , and sdst ( only for women ) scores relative to those without iadl limitation .
in the longitudinal analyses , baseline walking speed ( men : or 0.98 ; women : or 0.97 , p < 0.05 ) and word list memory task scores ( men : or 0.84 ; women : or 0.83 , p < 0.05 ) in both sexes and sdst scores in women ( or 0.96 , p = 0.04 ) were independent predictors of subsequent iadl limitation .
walking speed , memory , and processing speed may be independent predictors of iadl limitation in older adults .
instrumental activities of daily living memory processing speed walking speed 1 .
introduction the loss of the ability to conduct daily activities leads to a rise in morbidity , caregiver burden , and mortality [ 1,2 ] .
generally , everyday functioning ability in older adults consists of separate assessments of basic activities of daily living ( badls ) and instrumental activities of daily living ( iadls ) .
badls are self - maintenance skills , such as bathing , dressing , and toileting , whereas iadls are also routine activities , but they are more goal oriented and related to more complex and higher functional abilities , such as preparing a meal , handling finances , shopping , and other activities [ 3,4 ] .
older people with iadl limitations are frailer , because they have a greater number of associated health problems , such as disorders ( e.g. , histories of heart disease , stroke , depression , or diabetes ) , poorer cognitive function , and frequent falls [ 5 ] .
conversely , physical and cognitive status could also be predictors for the onset of iadl limitation in older people [ 6,7 ]. with respect to associations between cognitive function and iadl difficulty , a few longitudinal studies have focused on specific neuropsychological domains and examined causal relationships between multidimensional cognitive function and future decline in iadls .
for instance , johnson and colleagues performed a longitudinal study and showed that baseline executive functioning was associated with future worsening of iadl dependence [ 8 ] .
other studies have also examined associations between baseline cognitive domains , including memory or executive function , and a decline in iadls in older people [ 9,10 ] .
taken together , baseline cognitive functioning , particularly executive function and memory , appear to be important predictors of the onset of iadl limitation .
in contrast , physical function is strongly associated with the ability to perform iadls [ 11 ] .
in particular , aspects of walking ability , such as walking speed , could be strong predictors for the onset of iadl limitation in aged populations [ 12,13 ] .
in addition , depressive symptoms may be a predictor for an increase in iadl limitation [ 14 ] .
however , no studies have examined the means by which specific cognitive functions , including concurrent walking ability and depressive status in older adults , predict future iadl limitation .
therefore , we sought to determine whether baseline measures of cognitive functioning are independent predictors of subsequent iadl limitation , with walking speed and depressive symptoms considered covariates , in community - dwelling older adults aged 75 years and over with no iadl limitation at baseline .
we hypothesized that the association between cognitive function and future iadl decline would be independent of age , sex , education , medication , depressive status , and walking speed .
2. methods 2.1 .
participants all of the participants in this study were enrolled in the obu study of health promotion for the elderly ( oshpe ) [ 15 ] .
a letter of invitation was sent to all older individuals living in obu , a residential suburb of nagoya , japan , to participate in the oshpe .
excluded were participants requiring support or care certified by the japanese public long - term care insurance system ( care level >= 3 / 5 ) and those in similar ageing cohort studies .
at baseline , 1392 community - dwelling older adults aged 75 years or older participated in the study .
we conducted a baseline assessment for the oshpe , including a face - to - face interview and measures of physical and cognitive function ( august 2011 to february 2012 ) .
a follow - up postal survey was conducted approximately 15 months after baseline assessment ( november 2012 to may 2013 ) , with an offer of assistance in completing the study .
in the cross - sectional study , we excluded participants with a history of parkinson 's disease , stroke , alzheimer 's disease , or depression .
participants with missing values for education level ( n = 4 ) , depression symptoms ( n = 4 ) , walking speed ( n = 13 ) , cognitive function ( n = 31 ) , and self - reported iadls ( n = 11 ) at baseline were also excluded .
in this prospective study , we included participants who had completed baseline measures of walking speed and cognition and follow - up assessments of self - reported iadls. of the participants included in the cross - sectional study ( n = 1329 ) , participants who could not complete self - reported iadl assessment in a follow - up postal survey ( n = 247 ) or suffered a stroke , alzheimer 's disease , depression , or a hip fracture ( including those for whom onset of the disease was unknown ) subsequent to baseline assessment ( n = 134 ) were excluded .
ultimately , 948 participants without iadl limitation at baseline were included in the current prospective cohort study .
informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their inclusion in the study , and the ethics committee of the national center for gerontology and geriatrics approved the study protocol .
2.2 .
measurements demographic data including age , sex , and number of medications used on a regular basis were recorded during face - to - face interviews at baseline .
the participants completed a standardized questionnaire , which included the self - rated 15 - item geriatric depression scale ( gds ) [ 16 ] .
iadl limitation was assessed using the three subitems of the kihon - checklist [ 17 ] , a self - reported comprehensive health checklist that was developed by the japanese ministry of health , labour and welfare [ 18 ] , at baseline and 15 - month follow up. the three sub - items are as follows : ( 1 ) using the bus or train by myself , ( 2 ) buying daily necessities by myself , ( 3 ) managing my own deposits and savings at the bank by myself .
in the cross - sectional study , a participant response of " no " to one or more items at baseline assessment represented iadl limitation .
in the longitudinal study , none of the participants reported iadl limitation in any of the three sub - items at baseline .
participants with no iadl limitation , according to their responses to a 15 - month follow - up survey , were considered independent , and those who reported one or more iadl limitations in the 15 - month follow - up survey were assigned to the iadl - limitation group .
we measured baseline walking speed in seconds , using a stopwatch .
participants were asked to walk 6.4 m ( divided into two 2.0 m zones at each end and a 2.4 m middle zone ) at their usual pace .
we measured the time required ( in seconds ) to pass the 2.4 m middle zone over five trials in order to calculate mean gait speed ( meter per minute : m / m ) .
participants also underwent measures of global cognitive function , verbal memory , executive function , and processing speed using the national center for geriatrics and gerontology functional assessment tool ( ncgg - fat ) [ 19 ] .
global cognitive function was assessed using the mmse translated into japanese [ 20 ] , which is based on the original version [ 21 ] .
verbal memory was assessed using delayed recall in a word list memory task .
before delayed recall was tested , participants were instructed to memorize 10 words that were presented on a tablet pc. each of the 10 target words was shown for 2 s. a total of 30 words , including 10 target and 20 distracter words , were then presented , and participants were asked to choose the 10 target words immediately .
this was repeated for three trials , and participants were instructed to recall ( write down ) the 10 target words following a delay of approximately 20 min .
we calculated the total number of recalled target words .
one point was awarded for each word recalled correctly within 60 s , with a maximum score of 10 .
we used the tablet version of the symbol digit substitution test ( sdst ) to assess processing speed .
in this task , nine pairs of numbers and symbols were presented at the top of the display .
a target symbol was presented at the center of the display .
participants then chose a number that corresponded to a target symbol at the bottom of the display as rapidly as possible .
the score comprised the sum total of the correct numbers chosen within 90 s. one point was given for each number chosen correctly within the time limit .
higher scores represented better performance .
a previous study reported that sdst and the delayed recall word list memory task demonstrated excellent test - retest reliability and validated the test in comparison with scores on widely used conventional neurocognitive tests ( i.e. , the subtest of the alzheimer 's disease assessment scale - cognitive and the digit symbol - coding subtest of the wechsler adult intelligence scale ( third edition )) .
2.3 .
statistical analysis data entry and analysis was performed using spss version 19.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
a p value of < 0.05 was considered indicative of statistical significance .
means , standard deviations , and proportions were calculated to describe the samples and provide summary information regarding the measures used .
student 's t tests were used to compare differences in measures between the independent and iadl - limitation groups at baseline in the cross - sectional study .
chi - square tests were used to compare differences in rates of iadl limitation onset between men and women during the 15 - month follow - up period .
we also compared baseline measures between the independent and iadl - limitation groups using student 's t tests in the longitudinal study .
logistic regression analysis was performed to examine whether potential determinants were independently associated with subsequent iadl limitation .
in this analysis , subsequent iadl limitation was included as a dependent variable , and age , education level , number of medications used , gds score , walking speed , mmse , word list memory task scores , and sdst scores were included in the model as independent variables .
odds ratios ( ors ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) were calculated for the subsequent iadl limitations .
3. results results showed that 139 ( 21.8 % of 638 ) older men and 114 ( 16.5 % of 691 ) older women reported iadl limitation at the baseline assessment .
table 1 shows characteristics , gds , walking speed , and cognitive function comparisons between participants with and without iadl limitation at the baseline assessment .
men with iadl limitation exhibited significantly lower education levels , greater gds scores , and slower walking speeds relative to those observed in men without iadl limitation ( p < 0.01 ) .
women with iadl limitation were significantly older than men with iadl limitation ; they also exhibited significantly lower education levels , greater gds scores , and slower walking speeds than those observed in the men ( p < 0.01 ). with regard to cognitive performance tests , men without iadl limitation exhibited significantly higher scores on the mmse ( p = 0.024 ) and sdst ( p < 0.01 ) than those observed in men with iadl limitation .
mmse , word list memory task , and sdst scores in women without iadl limitation were significantly higher than those observed in women with iadl limitation ( p < 0.01 ) .

4. discussion in this cross - sectional study , which included a large sample of adults aged 75 years and older , older adults with iadl limitations showed poorer cognitive performance including global cognition , processing speed , and memory ( only in women ) than those with intact iadls .
in the longitudinal analysis involving the participants without baseline iadl limitation , we confirmed that the group that had subsequently developed iadl limitation during the 15 - month follow - up period exhibited poorer performance in tests assessing walking speed and cognitive function at baseline .
in particular , associations between subsequent iadl limitation and baseline measures of walking speed and memory were independent of age , education , number of medications used , depression status , and global cognition in both men and women .
in addition , poor processing speed was independently associated with a future decline in iadls in older women .
our finding that baseline cognitive function was associated with longitudinal decline in iadls extends previous findings regarding the effects of cognitive function on the ability to function in daily life .
iadl limitation may be an important predictor of mild cognitive impairment and dementia in cognitively healthy older adults [ 22,23 ] .
conversely , poor cognitive function affected the onset of iadl decline .
in particular , executive and memory dysfunction may have a greater impact on future iadl limitation [ 8,9,24 ] .
the results of the present study also indicate that older adults with poor performance in tests that assess memory and executive function , particularly processing speed at baseline , had a higher risk of developing subsequent iadl limitation .
these cross - sectional and longitudinal analyses determined whether participants had experienced the onset of a decline in three iadls , including using transportation , shopping , and managing finances .
a discussion regarding the types of activity that are considered iadls would be useful here .
in older people , other activities , such as cooking , housekeeping , and handling medication , are necessary for the maintenance of independence .
in addition , previous studies have divided iadls into two categories based on differences between activities involving high or low cognitive demand [ 22,25 ] .
reppermund and colleagues suggested that the restriction of functional ability was more prominent in highly cognitively demanding activities in individuals with cognitive impairment , including that of a mild degree , relative to cognitively healthy individuals , and that relative to older women , older men seem to experience greater difficulty in the performance of iadls that involve higher cognitive demand [ 25 ] .
furthermore , with regard to associations between cognitive function and iadl performance , processing speed was associated with the performance of iadls involving both higher and lower cognitive demand , but memory was only associated with high - demand factors [ 25 ] .
the questionnaire items used to assess iadl performance in the current study may have involved lower cognitive demand , but managing finances , in particular , seemed to require higher cognitive demand .
although it may be difficult to clarify differences in cognitive demand with respect to the iadls assessed in the current study , our findings suggest that cognitive function , including memory and processing speed , may be an important factor in maintaining iadls , such as using transportation , shopping , and managing finances in later life .
differences between men and women , with respect to factors associated with the onset of a decline in iadl performance , may have occurred because of differences in cognitive demand between activities .
walking ability has been found to be a useful predictor for the onset of functional decline in older people [ 26 ] .
we confirmed that walking speed was strongly associated with the ability to perform iadls and was found to be an independent predictor for the onset of iadl decline .
in the aged population , walking speed could be a valuable predictor of health status , including disability [ 27 ] , falls [ 28 ] , cognitive impairment [ 29 ] , institutionalization [ 30 ] , and survival [ 31 ] .
the results of this study indicated that slower walking speed , even in independent older adults without iadl limitation , predicted subsequent activity limitation .
this suggests that walking speed is worthy of being considered predictive of iadl limitation .
relative walking speed can be measured in any setting , without the need for specific skills or a particular environment .
therefore , walking speed could be considered a common variable with which to assess functional ability in older adults .
in contrast , gds score was not an independent predictor for subsequent iadl limitation in the longitudinal analyses .
some previous studies have suggested that depressive symptoms may be a predictor for an increase in disability [ 14,32 ] .
the relationship between depressive symptoms and iadl limitation may be more complex [ 14 ] .
this relationship is unlikely to be linear ; more severe depressive symptoms ( e.g. , those of moderate or major depression ) , may have a greater impact on subsequent iadl limitation .
these findings suggest that cognitive and physical health may be independent with respect to iadl in adults aged 75 years and over .
the findings of this study may also assist in the better prevention system ( e.g. , decision support system and using exergaming ) for early detection of the elderly risks like dementia and depression and improving physical fitness and life quality of elderly [ 33,34 ] .
strengths of the current study include the large sample size , the residential status and age of the participants ( community - dwelling adults aged 75 or older ) , the duration of the study period ( 15 months ) , and the longitudinal nature of the study design .
however , we acknowledge that the use of self - reported iadl function as assessed by only three items is a major limitation in this study .
the assessment of subsequent iadl limitation at follow up only included three self - reported aspects of daily activity , which were using transportation ( bus or train ) , shopping , and managing finances .
in addition , the follow - up period ( 15 months ) was shorter than that used in previous research ( e.g. , 2 - 10 years ) .
other iadl areas , such as using a phone , preparing meals , housekeeping , and taking medicine , should be considered as well .
we excluded older individuals with a self - reported history of parkinson 's disease , stroke , alzheimer 's disease , or depression and included participants were who living independently in the community and did not need any personal care or support ; thus , people with mild neurological disorders or mild cognitive impairment were likely to be included .
a more comprehensive assessment of iadl function will be needed in future research to clarify the longitudinal relationship between decline in iadl and cognitive functioning .
furthermore , because we did not repeat measures of cognitive function or walking speed , we could not assess bidirectional associations between cognitive and physical functioning and iadl limitation .
therefore , further work is required to explore interactive associations and the effects of changes in cognitive function and walking speed on subsequent iadl limitation .
5. conclusions the oshpe findings demonstrated relationships between cognitive decline , impaired physical functioning , and iadl limitation .
the results also indicated that walking speed , memory , and processing speed may predict subsequent iadl limitation in community - dwelling adults aged 75 years and older .

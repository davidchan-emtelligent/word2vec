background upstream bioprocesses are extremely complex since living organisms are used to generate active pharmaceutical ingredients ( apis ) .
cells in culture behave uniquely in response to their environment , thus culture conditions must be precisely defined and controlled in order for productivity and product quality to be reproducible .
thus , development culturing platforms are needed where many experiments can be carried out at once and pertinent scale - up information can be obtained .
results here we have tested a high throughput bioreactor ( htbr ) as a scale - down model for a lab - scale wave - type bioreactor ( cultibag ) .
mass transfer was characterized in both systems and scaling based on volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient ( kla ) was sufficient to give similar do trends .
htbr and cultibag cell growth and mab production were highly comparable in the first experiment where do and ph were allowed to vary freely .
in the second experiment , growth and mab production rates were lower in the htbr as compared to the cultibag , where ph was controlled .
the differences in magnitude were not considered significant for biological systems .
conclusion similar oxygen delivery rates were achieved in both systems , leading to comparable culture performance ( growth and mab production ) across scales and mode of mixing .
htbr model was most fitting when neither system was ph - controlled , providing an information - rich alternative to typically non - monitored ml - scale platforms .
background the upstream stages of a typical bioprocess are , arguably , the most complicated since living organisms are used .
cells in culture behave uniquely in response to their environment , thus culture conditions must be precisely defined and controlled in order for productivity and product quality to be reproducible .
consequently , upstream bioprocess development requires many experiments to optimize media and growth conditions , as well as select the actual production organism .
development experiments would be most informative if they could be carried out using the same equipment ( i.e. , the same scale ) eventually to be used for the commercial process .
however , due to economic and time constraints , strain selection and media and bioreactor development have typically been carried out in low volume , high throughput platforms , such as flasks on the scale of 50 - 6,000 ml and lab - scale bioreactors [ 1 ] .
the primary concern with development in small - scale platforms is whether cellular behavior exhibited is comparable to what will be observed at commercial - scale .
without monitoring and control of critical parameters ph and dissolved oxygen ( do ) in flasks , these parameters could drift to unfavorable levels , thus confounding cell viability , strain productivity or media component dependence [ 2 - 4 ] .
lab - scale bioreactors can monitor and control do and ph but they are comparatively low throughput ( i.e. , they run one relatively large culture at a time ) .
recently we described an ml - scale high throughput bioreactor system ( htbr ) which incorporates advances over the above described systems [ 5 ] .
the parallel reactor design allows up to twelve cultures to be carried out simultaneously .
each individual 35 ml ( working volume ) bioreactor contains a two - paddle impeller for stirring , gas in - and out - lets for aeration , and optical sensors for measurement of ph and do. we have also shown the optical sensors function equivalently as traditionally electrochemical probes for short - term culturing [ 6 ] .
use of wave - type bioreactors in industrial settings has increased steadily since their conception in the mid - 1990s .
these reactors were developed by singh and coworkers , then at schering plough , where they characterized mass transfer and cultivated cho , ns0 , hek 293 , and sf9 cells under a variety of conditions [ 7 ] .
the technology was further developed by the inventors as the primary product of wave biotech , now a subsidiary of ge corporation . disposable bioreactors are very attractive for industrial settings because they are single - use and , thus , do not require cleaning and sterilization nor the validation of these steps .
disposable bag systems with optical sensors for both ph and do ( cultibags ) by sartorius - stedim have been developed to allow both monitoring and control of these two critical cell culture parameters .
in the work presented here , our initial htbr publication [ 5 ] is expanded upon by testing whether the system is a good scale - down model for wave - type bioreactors .
oxygen mass transfer characterization and cell culture experiments were carried out to compare the two systems .
results and discussion mass transfer characterization the first step in establishing a scale - down model was to establish environments at both scales where oxygen delivery rate was approximately equal .
to do this , volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient ( kla ) was characterized in both systems with respect to agitation parameters and air flow rate .
when determining kla in the cultibag and htbr , the oxygen transfer rate into the optical sensing foils had to be taken into consideration and the transfer constants were determined to be 47.4 and 10.3 h - 1 , respectively .
transfer rate is a function of the sensor material , its thickness , and the boundary layers on either side of the material .
also , embedded in the transfer constant value is sensing reaction rate , which is based on the sensing chemistry .
although both reactor systems use fluorescence lifetime sensing for oxygen , the optical sensors are from different vendors , presens and fluorometrix , for cultibag and htbr , respectively , and the sensing chemistries are different .
detailed information about sensing chemistries and sensing foil construction is proprietary .
all of these factors could have contributed to the 4.6 - fold difference in transfer coefficients .
ultimately , the transfer rates were characterized to insure equal mass transfer in the experiments .
the objective of the paper is to show comparable cell culture performance ; in - depth sensing system analyses are beyond the scope .
figure 1 shows how kla changes with impeller rotational rate in the htbr , and rocking rate and angle in the cultibag , where both systems were aerated through the headspace only .
kla increased linearly with impeller rotational rate in the htbr and rocking rate in the cultibag ( 2 l , figure 1a ) .
at 3.5 l ( figure 1b ) , kla in the cultibag was unresponsive to a small increase in rocking rate from 8 to 10 rocks / min .
the same htbr data is used in both the 2 and 3.5 l plots , as the liquid volume was always 35 ml. figure 1 kla in htbr and cultibag .
kla in htbr and cultibag at various agitation speeds and rocking rates and angles .
( a ) htbr - 35 ml , cultibag - 2 l .
( b ) htbr - 35 ml , cultibag - 3.5 l. the measured cultibag kla ( 2 - 4 h - 1 ) were similar to those observed in other wave - type bioreactor characterization studies at comparable agitation and air flow rates [ 7,8 ] .
characterization conditions in the htbr were chosen to give mass transfer coefficients in the same approximate range .
this range is less than what has been achieved in other stirred small - scale bioreactor systems where kla of 360 h - 1 [ 9 ] and 1,500 h - 1 [ 10 ] have been observed .
however , our system volume was 4 - fold larger , and for the purpose of the study , low rates of impeller agitation and aeration through the headspace was chosen .
cell culture comparisons after showing the systems could provide similar environments in terms of oxygen delivery , culture performance experiments focusing on cell growth and mab production were carried out .
the first experiment , bioreactor comparison 1 , was conducted without controlling ph nor do in the cultibag , enabling a direct comparison to the htbr , which is not capable of controlling either parameter .
a working volume of 2 l in the cultibag resulted in approximately a 60x scale - down to the 35 ml htbr .
rocking rate and angle in the cultibag and agitation rate in the htbr were manipulated to achieve kla of 2.06 h - 1and 2.49 h - 1 , respectively .
approximately equalizing mass transfer in the two systems resulted in an accurate scale - down as demonstrated by the similar negative do slopes with respect to time from 16 - 28 and 30 - 40 hours in figure 2a , implying similar oxygen delivery rates to the cells by the reactors , given approximately equal oxygen uptake rates ( ours ) .
upon turning on air in both reactors , the cultibag recovered completely to saturation , but the htbr only responded with a slight increase , eventually continuing to decrease 1 - 2 h later .
this was unexpected , considering that the htbr kla was slightly higher than the cultibag 's ( 2.49 to 2.06 h - 1 ) .
it is possible the increased ability to deliver oxygen in the cultibag was a result of bag over - pressurization due to a partially blinded exhaust filter , an issue that has been observed by others [ 8 ] .
although a filter heater is provided which aims to evaporate any condensed liquid in the exhaust filter , splashing from the wave motion of the cell broth could lead to filter wetting and blinding .
in this experiment , liquid present in the filter housing and an increase in bag pressure both point to filter blinding .
although the cultibag system proved more controllable from a do standpoint by simply turning air on and off , it should be noted that the do concentration in the htbr never dropped below an unacceptable level ( i.e. , < 20 %) .
figure 2 do and ph profiles : bioreactor comparison 1 .
do ( a ) and ph ( b ) profiles during bioreactor comparison 1. from a qualitative perspective , the culture ph profiles from the two systems , shown in figure 2b , further support successful scale - down .
the ph progressed in opposite directions in the two systems for approximately the first 8 h. the small headspace volume relative to culture volume in the htbr enabled rapid replacement of off - gases by air , thus facilitating the stripping of dissolved co2 by air in the culture media , and increasing the ph. following this initial difference , ph in both reactor systems fluctuated , presumably , due to acidic byproduct secretion and stripping .
the former phenomenon overcame the latter in the cultibag once air was turned off , both times .
ph naturally dropped in the htbr even though the air stayed on , as was observed in other htbr experiments [ 5 ] .
it should be noted that the ph in neither system went outside of a range compatible with culture viability ( i.e. 6.6 - 7.6 ) .
the do and ph profiles demonstrated comparable behaviour across scales and reactor type , but the most important evidence of successful scale - down was equivalent culture growth and mab production .
the cultibag and htbr cell densities both peaked at 60 h into the experiment at 1.28 and 1.18 +/ - 0.24 x 106 cells / ml , respectively , as shown in table 1 .
igg3 was produced at 37 and 44 +/ - 12 pg / cell - day in the cultibag and htbr , respectively .
similar growth and specific productivities would thus ensure comparable reactor volumetric productivity upon scale - up. table 1 cell culture performance parameters bioreactor comparison 1 bioreactor comparison 2 parameter cultibag htbr cultibag htbr culture volume 2 l 35 ml 3.5 l 35 ml peak vcd ( x 106 cells / ml ) 1.28 1.18 +/ - 0.24 0.76 0.70 +/ - 0.18 final ivcd ( x 106 cells / ml - h ) 59.70 50.63 +/ - 9.89 38.39 23.85 +/ - 8.05 peak mab concentration ( mg / l ) 92.92 92.16 +/ - 7.08 42.41 26.65 +/ - 4.51 average growth rate ( 1 / h ) 0.026 0.029 +/ - 0.007 0.036 0.022 +/ - 0.005 average mab productivity ( pg / cell - d ) 37.35 44.87 +/ - 12.08 32 28.64 +/ - 5.70 summary of growth and mab production during the bioreactor comparisons .
all reactors from the same comparison inoculated from the same pool of cells .
n = 4 and 3 for htbr bioreactors in bioreactor comparisons 1 and 2 , respectively .
in a second cell culture comparison experiment , the culture volume of the cultibag was 3.5 l , resulting in a 100 - fold scale - down to the htbr .
the cultibag and htbr were operated using the same agitation parameters as were used in bioreactor comparison 1 , resulting in kla of 2.34 and 2.49 h - 1 , as shown in figure 1b .
these oxygen mass transfer coefficients and the observed cellular behaviours led to the do profiles shown in figure 3a , which were similar for both systems .
oscillations in cultibag do profiles are a result of intermittent co2 gas addition for ph control , which strips do from the media .
do started lower in the htbr in comparison to the cultibag due to the time delay in inoculation , as was the case in the first experiment .
the overall similarity in do profiles among both systems is strong evidence that the htbr is an appropriate scale - down model when scaled on the basis on volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient ( kla ) .
figure 3 do and ph profiles : bioreactor comparison 2 .
do ( a ) and ph ( b ) profiles during bioreactor comparison 2 .
in bioreactor comparison 2 , ph was controlled in the cultibag by way of intermittent co2 injections into the headspace air stream .
the ph profiles in figure 3b show oscillations around the ph set point of 7.3 for the cultibag .
htbr ph was maintained in the range of 6.9 - 7.3 for the vast majority of the experiment by aeration with 5 % co2 in air .
this range of 0.4 ph units is relatively tight in comparison the 6.7 - 7.7 ph range observed in bioreactor comparison 1 .
thus simply aerating with a co2 : air mixture improves the htbr 's ability to behave similarly to a ph - controlled reactor .
the ph profile in the cultibag demonstrates the ability to control ph in wave - type systems using optical sensors for monitoring .
anecdotally , ph control has been a problem in wave - type systems when using electrochemical ph probes .
culture performance was less similar in bioreactor comparison 2 .
in terms of all growth and mab production parameters ( peak viable cell density , peak mab concentration , integrated viable cell density , average growth rate , and specific productivity ) , the cultibag out - performed the htbr ( table 1 ) .
however , cultibag peak cell density and specific productivity were less than one standard deviation from the htbr mean. and for the other three parameters , the htbr value was < 40 % lower than the cultibag value , a difference which was not considered significant for biological systems .
one explanation for increased performance over the htbr may have been the ability to tightly control ph in the cultibag .
differences in ph have been shown to affect specific productivity by others [ 11 ] .
systems traditionally used for ml - scale development ( e.g. , flasks ) also do not have ph control .
thus , the htbr is similar in that regard .
what makes the htbr an improvement over existing systems is that ph and do can be monitored , allowing cause and effect relationships be drawn between these parameters and culture performance .
use of ph control in comparison 2 serves several purposes .
first , it demonstrates control precision capable in wave - type systems with optical ph sensors .
second , it demonstrates the need for ph control at ml - scale ; an improvement that has been implemented in the next generation htbr .
conclusion two bioreactor systems spanning mode of mixing and scale were used to culture igg3 producing hybridoma cells .
mass transfer was characterized in both systems and scaling based on volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient ( kla ) was sufficient to give similar do trends .
htbr and cultibag cell growth and mab production rates were approximately equal in the first experiment where do and ph were allowed to vary freely .
in the second experiment , growth and mab production levels were higher in the cultibag , where ph was more tightly controlled .
in closing , since similar oxygen delivery rates could be achieved , and culture performance ( growth and mab production ) was consistent across scales , the htbr shows promise as a high - throughput scale - down model for wave - type bioreactors .
methods bioreactor descriptions cells were grown in two bioreactor systems : a cultibag rm optical ( sartorius - stedim ) and an htbr ( fluorometrix , stowe , ma ) .
for the cultibag cultures , 10 l polyethylene bags were used , each containing optical sensor foils for ph and do. the htbr is capable of simultaneously carrying out 12 cultures where each reactor vessel has a maximum 35 ml working volume and optical sensors for do and ph [ 5 ] .
the htbr used for this study is only capable of monitoring , not controlling do and ph. kla and optical do sensor patch responses measurements kla was determined at different agitation speeds in the htbr and , volume , rocking angles and rates in the cultibag using the dynamic " gas out - gas in " method [ 12 ] .
when the sensor response time is taken into consideration to account for the time required for do diffusion from the liquid bulk into the sensor foils [ 13 ] , the oxygen mass balance can be solved explicitly for the do concentration in the sensor patch , cp : ( 1 ) where is the do concentration at the air - liquid interface , c0 is the initial do concentration in the bulk liquid , and kp is the volumetric mass transfer coefficient into the sensor foil , which was determined by independently by modelling the response in cp to an ideal step change in liquid bulk do. kla can be determined upon fitting cp - time profiles to equation 1 .
cell line and growth media the cell line is a sp2 / 0 myeloma / mouse hybridoma cell line ( 2055.5 ) ; it produces an igg3 mab specific for neisseria meningitidis capsular polysaccharides ( anti - mcps ) [ 14 ] .
cells were grown in cd hybridoma ( gibco , carlsbad , ca ) , a protein - free media supplemented to 2 mm glutamine ( hyclone , laboratories inc. , logan , ut ) , 100 units / ml penicillin ( hyclone ) , 100 mug / ml streptomycin ( hyclone ) , 1 g / l pf - 68 ( mp biomedicals , llc , aurora , oh ) and 3.5 x 10 - 4 % beta - mercaptoethanol ( v / v ) ( sigma , st. louis , mo ) .
working cultures were maintained in spinner flasks housed in a water - jacketed incubator ( napco , winchester , va ) at 37degreesc and 50 % relative humidity with a headspace co2 composition of 5 % in air .
cell culture experiments two separate bioreactor comparison experiments were carried out ( bioreactor comparisons 1 and 2 ) .
within each experiment , all bioreactors used were inoculated from the same pool of cells .
cells were counted using a hemocytometer where viability was assessed using the trypan blue exclusion method .
igg3 product was measured using a sandwich - type elisa [ 15 ] .
in the first experiment , bioreactor comparison 1 , the htbr and cultibag were used at 35 ml and 2 l , respectively .
neither ph nor do concentration was controlled in either system .
cultures were aerated via the headspace with air at 0.3 vvm in the htbr and 0.05 vvm in the cultibag when do concentration dropped below 40 % air saturation .
agitation speed in the htbr ( 200 rpm ) and rocking rate ( 10 rocks / min ) and angle ( 4.5degrees ) in the cultibag were chosen to approximately match kla in the two systems .
in the second experiment , bioreactor comparison 2 , the htbr was again used at 35 ml , however the volume of the cultibag was 3.5 l , resulting in a 100x scale - up relative to htbr .
ph was controlled in the cultibag via intermittent co2 addition .
when not introducing co2 , there was constant headspace aeration of air at 0.05 vvm .
in the htbr , a 5 % co2 in air solution was continuously headspace aerated at 0.3 vvm .
do was not controlled in either system .
kla was again approximately equalized in the two systems .
the agitation speed of the htbr was 200 rpm .
the cultibag was rocked at a rate of 10 rocks / min at an angle of 4.5degrees .

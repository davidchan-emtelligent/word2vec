foreign body ingestion is very common in childhood especially under 3 year of age .
pica syndrome is characterized by an appetite for substances that are largely non - nutritive .
we present a 3 - year old girl who presented to er with symptoms and signs of intestinal obstruction .
intestinal perforation foreign body children pica syndrome case report a 3 - year - old girl admitted to our emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting for the last three hours .
she had history of dysphagia for one month and contrast - swallow ( performed a month before presentation ) was found to be normal .
on examination , she had abdominal distention and tenderness with no bowel sounds .
nasogastric intubation was performed .
all laboratory examinations were normal including leucocyte count , crp and biochemical analysis .
abdominal x - ray showed a radio - opaque mass located below the liver ( fig.1 ) .
ultrasonography suspected abscess formation ( 33mm x 27mm ) on right side of the abdomen .
on ct scan there was suspicion of perforation or possible abdominal mass filling right side of abdomen .
decision of surgery was thus taken .
during intubation , a button of pant was found stuck in her nostrils .
bronchoscopy was performed for other possible foreign body and infectious mucus was aspirated from the main bronchi .
on exploration , intestinal perforation was found with fecal content protruding through extensively dilated ileocecal region and a mass was seen arising from it ( fig.2 ) .
resection of terminal ileum , cecum and ascending colon was performed ; and ileostomy and colonic mucous fistula were made .
postoperative recovery was uneventful .
pathology was reported as feces containing many foreign materials such as hair , plastic and some unidentified materials .
she was referred to pediatric psychiatry .
four months after the operation , closure of the stoma was performed .

discussion foreign body ingestion is the second most common endoscopic emergency after gi bleeding. [ 1 ] upper end of the esophagus is the most common site of foreign body impaction accounting over 75 % of all cases. [ 2 ] in our case , there was history of difficulty in swallowing which lasted for some days .
we believe , at that time she might have ingested a foreign body which was stuck at the physiologic constrictions of the esophagus .
the upper contrast series was found normal as the foreign body might have moved down to the stomach or intestine .
even less than 1 % perforation is a risk after foreign body ingestion .
it mostly occurs at physiological sphincters such as pylorus , ileocecal valve , angulations such as duodenum , hepatic / splenic flexures , anastomosis of former operations or regions of congenital malformation. [ 2 - 4 ] in our case , patient had eaten many non - food items which were stuck at ileocecal region causing inflammation and perforation .
we believe , the same foreign body which was stuck at esophagus might have caused perforation a month before presentation as the contrast material ( contrast study performed at that time ) was found in the fecal mass containing many foreign bodies .

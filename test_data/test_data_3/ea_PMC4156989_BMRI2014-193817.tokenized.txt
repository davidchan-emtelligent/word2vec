drug repositioning is a popular approach in the pharmaceutical industry for identifying potential new uses for existing drugs and accelerating the development time .
non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide .
to reduce the biological heterogeneity effects among different individuals , both normal and cancer tissues were taken from the same patient , hence allowing pairwise testing. by comparing early - and late - stage cancer patients , we can identify stage - specific nsclc genes .
differentially expressed genes are clustered separately to form up - and downregulated communities that are used as queries to perform enrichment analysis .
the results suggest that pathways for early - and late - stage cancers are different .
sets of up - and downregulated genes were submitted to the cmap web resource to identify potential drugs .
to achieve high confidence drug prediction , multiple microarray experimental results were merged by performing meta - analysis .

in conclusion , we have been able to assess the potential existing drugs to identify novel anticancer drugs , which may be helpful in drug repositioning discovery for nsclc .
1. introduction lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] .
according to medical classification , lung cancer can be divided into two major classes : small cell lung cancer ( sclc ) and non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) .
nsclc accounts for more than 85 % of all lung cancer cases , and adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype .
the question of how to search for suitable potential drugs for nsclc is an important issue in biomedical research .
however , the process of new drug development is cost - intensive and time - consuming .
a previous study [ 3 ] established a systematic strategy to identify potential drugs and target genes for lung cancer .
the findings from this study suggested that eight drugs from drugbank and three drugs from ncbi could potentially reverse the expression of certain up - and downregulated genes .
these results are supported by ic50 experimental data .
however , the previous study can be extended in several aspects that were addressed in the present study .
cancer is a multistage progression process that results from genetic sequences mutations , where early - and late - stage cancer - associated genes ( cag ) are potentially very different .
therefore , the aim of this paper is to explore a strategy to identify stage - specific potential drugs for nsclc through an integrated analysis of microarray profiling .
in order to reduce the effect of biological heterogeneity among different individuals , normal as well as cancer tissues were taken from the same patient .
to address the target drug problem , there is a need to address the following issues .
first , there is concern that different individuals may correspond to different sets of differentially expressed genes .
second , it is known that cancer is a heterogeneous disease ; different stages of cancer correspond to different drug targets involving stage - specific cag .
third , results derived from different microarray profiling vary from study to study ; therefore , a rigorous approach is needed to address this problem .
fourth , reliability of drug finding prediction remains to be verified .
in order to reduce the biological heterogeneity effect among different individuals , tumor / adjacent nontumor pairwise arrays for nsclc were employed in the present study , thus allowing pairwise statistical tests .
to deal with the second issue , the samples were divided into early - stage and late - stage ones , which are denoted as stage ia / ib and stage iii / iv , respectively .
for the third issue , meta - analysis was adopted to integrate multiple microarray profiles .
finally , potential drug predictions were validated via biochemical assays .
many proteins are associated with human diseases , although very often their precise functional role in disease pathogenesis remains unclear .
a strategy to gain a better understanding into the interaction and function of these proteins is to make use of the protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) data and construct a network for disease - associated proteins .
in our previous work [ 3 , 4 ] , it was hypothesized that the ppi networks , derived from differentially expressed genes ( degs ) , could be analyzed topologically to prioritize potential drug targets .
we performed gene set enrichment analysis ( gsea ) for pathway analysis and then made use of drug - gene interaction databases and the connectivity map ( cmap ) to find potential drugs for the treatment of nsclc .
it is conjectured that a small drug molecule may potentially reverse the disease signature if the molecule - induced signature is significantly negatively correlated with the disease - induced signature found in the cmap [ 4 ] .
in fact , potential new treatments for cancers have been successfully identified via the cmap , including acute leukemia , colon cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma , neuroblastoma , nsclc , and renal cell carcinoma [ 5 - 7 ] .
both up - and downexpressed genes are potential therapeutic targets ; therefore , identification of potential drugs to treat lung cancer by using an in silico screening approach followed by mtt assay or clonogenic assay validation might accelerate drug discovery .
in section 2 , we give a description of the input data and the methods used in this paper .
in section 3 , results for cluster analysis , enriched pathways , and cmap drug predictions are reported .
we conclude in the final section .
2. methods this study proposes an in silico strategy to narrow down the search for lung cancer genes for target identification and drug discovery ; the workflow of this study is shown in figure 1 .
2.1 .
input data set the microarray data for lung cancer was downloaded from geo [ 8 ] and summarized in table 1 .
experiments gse7670 [ 9 ] and gse10072 [ 10 ] use the hg - u133a array , where gse19804 [ 11 ] and gse27262 [ 12 ] use hg - u133 plus 2.0 chip .
each sample consisted of cancerous and noncancerous lung tissues obtained from a cohort of patients .
to infer differentially expressed genes ( degs ) , two pair tests ( normal as well as cancer tissues are taken from the same patient ) were conducted .
the main advantage of using paired samples is that it could reduce the biological heterogeneity effect .
in the late stages of cancer , it is very common to find cell invasion , metastasis , and drug - resistance related genes [ 13 ] .
to investigate this issue , we divided the samples into early - and late - stage ones .
early - stage samples were taken from patients with stage i , ia , and ib cancers , whereas late - stage data were obtained from stage iii and iv patients .
2.2 .
microarray data analysis microarray technology allows for high - throughput screening and analysis of tens of thousands of genes at the same time .
some genes are activated or inhibited , and some are degs , which due to certain regulatory factors , result in changes in gene expression levels by a few times , ten times , or more .
given sets of microarray data , one can identify degs among a large number of gene expressions and understand the mechanism of lung cancer formation induced by these degs .
there are many microarray data analysis methods , such as using the concept of false discovery rate ( fdr ) to screen for significant genes [ 14 ] , using anova to explore the impact of microarray gene expression values within a single factor [ 15 ] , and clustering analysis .
among the many statistical methods , significance analysis of microarray ( sam ) [ 16 , 17 ] , empirical bayes analysis of microarrays ( ebam ) [ 18 ] , and empirical bayes statistics ( ebayes ) [ 19 ] are three commonly employed approaches to screen degs .
the publicly available microarray data analysis package bioconductor [ 20 , 21 ] was adopted to perform such calculations .
the statistical method ebayes was chosen in this study because it was found that ebayes , sam , and ebam achieve a similar level of cancer gene prediction accuracy [ 22 ] .
the selected degs were divided into two groups , an upregulated group ( up probes in figure 1 ) and a downregulated group ( down probes ) , according to the gene expression fold change ( fc ) values .
among the degs , genes were classified as either up - or downregulated genes if the log 2 fc was less than or greater than zero , respectively .
any gene expression level with fold change less than 5.64 ( log 2 50 ) was reset to 5.64 in order to facilitate the cmap search .
2.3 .
cluster analysis we adopted biogrid version 3.2.101 in our analysis , which consists of 209,838 ppi records .
in a ppi network , a densely connected area is referred to as a cluster , which is a functional module .
nodes having a high degree of connection are defined as hubs and are more likely to be essential .
members of a cluster are usually involved in similar biological processes , and protein complexes can be identified through the clustering of a network [ 23 , 24 ] .
it is suggested that a protein complex is a biologically functional module composed of subunits performing similar functions [ 25 ] .
given two proteins , a and b , with a ppi , if both a and b are obtained from the ebayes prediction as upregulated , then the ppi among a and b is the so - called up ppi .
communities constructed from up ppi are called upregulated communities .
to investigate the functional modules in which potential lung cancer related proteins are involved , a set of highly confident human ppis were input to the cfinder software [ 26 ] to perform an analysis based on the clique percolation clustering approach [ 27 ] .
a k - community was set with k being equal to three ( complete subgraphs of size k ) .
any two k - communities are adjacent if they share k - 1 common nodes .
a k - community ( k >= 4 ) is constructed by merging all possible adjacent ( k - 1 ) - communities .
2.4 .
gene set enrichment analysis ( gsea ) david [ 28 ] is a web - based resource which provides batch annotation and go [ 29 ] term enrichment analysis to highlight the most relevant go terms associated with a given gene list .
the consensuspathdb ( cpdb ) [ 30 ] tool provides gene set analysis and metabolite set analysis .
the david tool is based on the fisher exact test , while the cpdb tool is based on the wilcoxon test .
to find the enriched pathways of our lung cancer gene signature , we performed an overrepresentation pathway analysis using both david and cpdb .
under the threshold of a p value of less than 0.005 , enriched pathways from the overrepresentation analysis including up - and downregulated k - communities were obtained from cfinder analysis .
significant pathway results were ranked according to the p value .
thus , enriched go terms for these two protein groups were obtained .
we used both tools in this stage for cross - verification .
2.5 .
potential target genes and drug discovery both of the up - and downregulated communities are derived from the cfinder tool and were used to query the cmap database , where potential drugs with p values of less than 0.05 are retained .
to identify target genes , the fda - approved drugs and the chemical - protein links data from stitch [ 31 ] were merged .
the gene name service was then used to translate the protein id to its corresponding hugo - approved gene symbol and entrez gene id. drugs obtained from the cmap output were mapped and finally identified with known drug targets in the cancer up - or downregulated ppi network .
the idea of drug repositioning is a recently developed approach in the pharmaceutical industry that endeavors to identify new uses for existing drugs and has achieved certain successes [ 32 ] .
furthermore , this approach has the potential to accelerate the development time for drugs , as well as reducing side effects .
there are many works on identifying repositioned drugs , which are based on various methods : the graph - based inference method [ 33 , 34 ] , the microarray expression method [ 35 ] , the differential expressed correlation method [ 36 ] , and the integration of phenotypic , chemical indexes and ppi method [ 37 ] , and using the drug - gene - disease relationship [ 38 ] .
we also note that cancerresource [ 39 ] is a very comprehensive resource for drug repositioning study .
several issues arise from combining different datasets , such as the problem of data heterogeneity , different sample sizes , and the data dependence problem .
in principle , these issues can be tackled by employing a meta - analysis approach .
meta - analysis ( ma ) [ 40 , 41 ] is a set of statistical methods for summarizing the results of several studies into a single estimate .
the strength of ma is that it is capable of identifying relationships across a number of different studies .
for the drug prediction study , cmap provides an enrichment score , rho , and a p value to quantify each cmap drug .
the rho value lies between - 1 and 1 ; therefore it can be treated as a sample correlation coefficient and serve as an effect size index for ma [ 41 ] .
in practice , rho is transformed to the fisher z scale , and all the analyses are conducted using the converted values .
after the analyses are completed , the z values are transformed back to the original metric .
the transformation to fisher 's z is given by ( 1 ) z = 12ln 1 + rho1 - rho and the variance of z is defined by v z = 1 /( n - 3 ) , where n denotes the sample size .
the weight assigned to each study in a fixed - effect model is given by ( 2 ) wi = 1vyi , where w i is the within - study variance for study i. the weighted mean ( m ) is computed as ( 3 ) m = sumi = 1kwiyisumi = 1kwi .
for unweighted calculations , w i equals one .
the variance of the summary effect ( v m ) is given by ( 4 ) vm = sumi = 1kwi - 1 .
for unweighted calculations , the z - score for normal distribution is defined by ( 5 ) z = msem , where sem denotes the standard error and is equal to vm. for weighted calculations , the z - score is defined by ( 6 ) z = sumi = 1kwiyisumi = 1kwi2. from ( 7 ) , one can determine the one - tailed test p value .
the 95 % lower and upper limits for the summary effect would be computed as ( 7 ) llm = m - 1.96xsem,ulm = m + 1.96xsem .
the formula for the random - effects model is given in a monograph written by borenstein et al .
[ 41 ] .
the above analyses allow us to determine the confidence interval of the cc , r. besides the use of rho , the use of the fisher combined test ( fct ) [ 40 ] is another option .
the fisher summary statistic method combines the p values and is defined by ( 8 ) fi = - 2sumj = 1nlog pij which tests ( chi - square chi 2 ) the null hypothesis for gene i , where indices i and j denote the ith gene from the jth dataset , respectively .
however , cmap may return a zero p value , hence rendering ( 8 ) infinite ; therefore , it was not used in the present analysis .
there are two models in meta - analysis : the fixed - effect model and random - effect model [ 41 ] .
in the fixed - effect model it is assumed that there is only one true effect size and that all differences among the studies or batches are due to sampling errors only .
in contrast , the random - effect model allows the effect size to vary from study to study .
each study estimates a different effect size .
these two models are considered in our work .
in other words , a test for homogeneity of distribution was performed .
as it is rather common to find that the effect size may vary from one study to the next , we employ the ma method , such as the q statistics and i 2 statistics , to quantify the heterogeneity , to test it , and to incorporate it into the weighting scheme .
we use a p value of 0.1 for i 2 statistics as the criterion for statistical significance .
a p value larger than or equal to 0.1 means that there is little variation between batches ; then a fixed - effect model might be appropriate ; otherwise choose random - effect model [ 41 ] .
degree of heterogeneity is characterized by the i 2 value .
a value of i 2 less than 25 % implies no heterogeneity , whereas a value larger than 75 % means extremely high heterogeneity .
if the studies are homogenous , then it is likely that the various studies are testing the same hypothesis .
if these estimates are heterogeneous , then it is probable that each study is not testing the same hypothesis .
therefore , it may not be appropriate to combine all the study results into one meta - analysis .
in such case , we would need to conduct a separate meta - analysis , such as meta - regression analysis for different subsets of studies [ 41 ] .
2.6 .
cell culture all cell - culture - related reagents were purchased from invitrogen .
human lung cancer cell lines a549 and h460 were purchased from the american type culture collection / bioresource collection and research center ( bcrc ) ( taiwan ) .
these cells have performed str - pcr profile at bcrc .
a14 was a derivative of a549 cells stably selected with a p53 shrna construct .
human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines , cl1 - 0 and cl1 - 5 , were kind gifts from dr. pan - chyr yang .
h1299 stable clones ( transfected with egfr - wt ( wild type ) and egfr - l858r mutant ) were kindly provided by dr. yi - rong chen .
all cells were cultured in rpmi 1640 with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) , 2 mm of l - glutamine , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin and maintained in a 37degreesc , 5 % co2 incubator .
2.7 .
mtt cell viability test cell viability was determined using an mtt assay .
cells were seeded in a 96 - well microplate for 16 ~ 20 hrs and treated with the indicated drugs .
after drug treatment for 72 hrs , 50 mul mtt solution ( 2 mg / ml ) per well was added and incubated at 37degreesc .
two hours later , 150 mul liquid per well was removed and dmso was added and the absorbance at 570 nm was detected using an elisa reader ( infinite m1000 , tecan , switzerland ) .
the untreated groups were considered to be 100 % viable .
2.8 .
clonogenic assay two nsclc cell lines , a549 and h460 , were seeded in 6 - well plates with 500 cells / well for 7 - 10 days .
each well contained 1.5 ml rpmi medium as culture condition and tested drugs were added 24 hrs after the seeding of the cells .
the medium and drugs were changed once on day four .
after treatment , cells were washed with pbs , and the colonies were fixed ( acetic acid : methanol , 1 : 3 ) and stained with 0.5 % crystal violet in methanol .
after removing the excess crystal violet and rinsing with tap water , the colonies were counted manually .
3. results 3.1 .
microarray data analysis in this study multiple microarray source data were employed for analysis .
robust multiarray average ( rma ) was used for gene expression normalization .
the ebayes analysis was subsequently conducted on the previous results .
degs were predicted by an ebayes with an adjusted p value of 0.005. by integrating with the biogrid [ 42 ] ppi data , a list of binary interactions among degs was determined for the up and down groups .
there may be concern regarding the use of different microarray platforms being subjected to heterogeneity problem .
we note that the following two steps can tackle such concern : ( i ) selecting common degs among all the platforms for further analysis and ( ii ) employing meta - analysis approach and performing test of heterogeneity to determine whether the fixed - effect model or random - effect model is needed .
a total of 642 and 780 genes were identified as the common degs for the early - and late - stage cancer , respectively .
the results of the total number of degs , " up " and " down " degs for early - and late - stages of cancer , are reported in table 2 .
the second last column in the table denotes the total number of up and down degs for different gse platforms .
it is noted that the number of " down " degs identified is larger than " up " degs in both of early - and late - stages , in which the ratio is about 2 to 1 .
3.2 .
cluster analysis genes which do not highly interact with other genes are assumed to be less important and consequently such genes were removed before the subsequent analysis .
hence , by cfinder , any gene which did not belong to a k - community was excluded .
we also counted the number of k - communities in the nsclc ppi network and found there was no community with k larger than five .
table 3 summarizes the number of k - communities identified by cfinder .
for early - stage , a total of six and sixteen genes belong to the two up - and seven downregulated k - communities , respectively , whereas a total of forty - five and sixteen genes belong to the thirty - four up - and six downregulated k - communities , respectively , for late - stage .
only genes belonging to the communities identified by cfinder were selected for the next stage of analysis .
3.3 .
enriched biological pathways pathway annotation of communities was given by implementing david and cpdb .
according to reactome [ 43 ] and kegg [ 44 ] databases , pathways with their p values less than 0.05 and ranked among the top ten are reported .
using the annotation tool in david database reactome , table 4 lists the enriched pathways information for early - and late - stage nsclc .
the " count " and "%" columns denote the number of overlapped genes in the filtered community genes and the corresponding pathway and the percentage of overlapped genes , respectively .
as we noted from table 4 , gsea suggested that hemostasis , signaling in immune system , integrin cell surface interaction , and metabolism of carbohydrates are enriched pathways for early - stage cancer , whereas cell cycle and dna replication pathways are ranked among the top for late - stage cancer .
it is noted that these late - stage cancer pathways are dominated by cell - cycle related processes .
cancer is a multistage progression process that results from mutations in genetic sequences .
accumulation of genetic mutations could lead to a defective dna repair mechanism , consequently giving rise to genetic instability and uncontrolled cell growth [ 45 ] .
numerous studies have reported that homeostasis and cancer formation are related [ 46 - 49 ] .
integrins are the receptors that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) .
varner and cheresh [ 50 ] pointed out in 1996 that ecm receptors , integrins , regulate the cellular proliferation machinery in tumor cells .
in the seminal review paper written by hanahan and weinberg [ 51 ] , it was reported that integrin can influence cell behavior and transform cells into an active proliferative state .
recent studies have also suggested that integrins are involved in cancer progression [ 52 , 53 ] and lung squamous cell carcinoma [ 54 ] .
furthermore , elevated glucose consumption is observed in tumor formation [ 55 - 57 ] .
late - stage cancer patients commonly have cell invasion and metastasis .
malignant cells have the ability to invade adjacent normal tissue structures .
malignant tumor cells break off from the tumor and enter blood vessels or the lymphatic system and migrate to other parts of the body and initiate another tumor .
biomedical studies have suggested that the development of the metastatic process involves an interaction between cell cycle signaling , adhesion pathways , and epithelial - mesenchymal transition program [ 13 ] .
it is also known that signal transduction pathways , such as p53 , mapk , notch , and ros , are heavily involved in metastasis [ 58 ] .
in particular , mutations in p53 and k - ras appears only later in tumor progression [ 45 ] .
defects in the cell cycle mitotic checkpoint generate aneuploidy and might facilitate tumorigenesis [ 59 ] .
mitotic progression and sister - chromatid segregation are controlled by the anaphase promoting complex / cyclosome ( apc / c ) .
apc / c forms a protein complex with its mitotic coactivator , cdc20 , which controls mitotic progression [ 59 ] .
cdc20 protein level may directly affect cell fate during prolonged mitotic arrest [ 60 ] and its turnover rate may be a key factor in cancer patient response to antimitotic therapies [ 61 ] .
using the cpdb tool , the top ten most significant pathways for early - stage nsclc and late - stage nsclc returned by reactome are listed in table 5 .
again , gsea suggested that hemostasis , cell surface interaction , and metabolism of carbohydrates , that is , glycolysis and gluconeogenesis , are the enriched pathways for early - stage cancer .
for late - stage cancer , again it is found that the cell cycle pathways are ranked among the top pathways .
essentially , results returned by david and cpdb are consistent with each other. from table 5 , it is found that pecam1 [ 62 - 64 ] and cbl are frequently altered in lung cancer [ 65 ] , and cd28 is associated with nsclc formation [ 66 ] .
pecam1 interactions are related to angiogenesis .
using the kegg database , pathways with p value less than 0.05 returned by david are listed for early - stage and late - stage cancer in table 6 .
again , enrichment analysis suggested that glycolysis / gluconeogenesis and cell signaling are the enriched pathways for early - stage cancer .
it is known that integrin is a key regulator of cell adhesion [ 53 ] .
it was also found that the cell cycle pathway and dna replication pathway were ranked among the top pathways for late - stage cancer .
it is known that cancer is due to uncontrolled cell mitosis , and this uncontrolled process is a common element in all types of cancer .
cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) , a diverse system of glycoproteins , have been found to play an important role in cancer progression and in the application of cancer therapy [ 67 - 69 ] .
tight junctions are cellular structures located at the apicobasal region of epithelial cell membranes [ 70 ] .
it has been experimentally found that lung tumors show changes in the expression in tight junction proteins [ 71 ] .
other studies have also indicated that tight junction proteins show aberrant expression in breast cancer [ 72 ] and correlate with metastasis [ 73 - 75 ] .
we noted that the significant enriched pathways found in table 6 ( late - stage ) are also identified in the work by liu et al .
[ 76 ] .
except oocyte meiosis , the other four pathways are involved in two nsclc subtypes : adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma .
using the cpdb tool , significant pathways returned by kegg are listed in table 7 .
again it was found that the cell cycle pathway and dna replication pathway are ranked among the top pathways for late - stage cancer .
the hypoxia - inducible factor - 1 ( hif - 1 ) is an oxygen - sensitive transcriptional activator and is causally involved in nsclc [ 77 - 79 ] .
again , the cell cycle pathway ranked first ( among the top of the list ) both in reactome and kegg using cpdb .
in other words , analyses using david and cpdb are in good agreement .
relative to david , cpdb tends to return more pathway information .
integrins are the receptors that mediate cell adhesion to ecm .
the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) is a network of macromolecules that underlies all epithelia and endothelia and that surrounds all connective tissue cells .
this matrix provides mechanical strength and also influences the behavior and differentiation state of cells in contact with it .
3.4 .
potential drugs and their target genes for nsclc both the up - and downregulated communities extracted from cfinder were analyzed by cmap .
under the constraint of an enrichment score ( es ) of less than zero , and cmap drugs associated with p value , that is , cmap p value less than 0.1 or 0.5 , potential drugs were inferred by performing ma. fisher 's summary statistic method was used for combining cmap p value .
after performing meta - analysis using es as the effect size , twenty - four potential drugs were found with a p value for ma being less than 0.05 for early - stage cancer .
the results are listed in table 8 .
among the twenty - four drugs , two drugs tested by mtt or clonogenic assay were validated as effective ( i.e. , mebendazole and prenylamine ). from table 8 , among the 30 potential drugs ( p value for ma is less than 0.05 ) for late - stage cancer , there were six drugs tested by mtt or clonogenic assay and validated as effective , that is , mebendazole , spiperone , anisomycin , pyrvinium , mefloquine , and niclosamide .
we performed the heterogeneity test on the 24 drugs for early - stage and the 30 drugs for the late - stage cancer using the i 2 statistics .
it is found that both of the fix - effect model and the random - effect model are required according to the i 2 statistics test with a p value less than 0.1 [ 41 ] .
we used available drugs in the list for in vitro cytotoxic validations ( table 9 ) .
certain drugs showed effective cytotoxic effects for lung cancer cells .
however , the very limited data showed that there were inconsistencies in mtt and clonogenic assays .
for example , mebendazole showed a good ic50 in mtt (< 1 mum ) but not in the clonogenic assay (> 10 mum ) .
on the other hand , spiperone showed a relatively effective ic50 (< 10 mum ) in clonogenic assay rather than in mtt assay (> 10 mum ) .
this phenomenon is still hard to explain in the current status .
dose - dependent figures for four of the representable drugs are shown in figure 2 .
the reasons to use two most commonly used lung cancer cell lines a549 and h460 include the following : ( i ) they have different histologic subtypes , that is , a549 is adenocarcinoma and h460 is large cell carcinoma , although both belong to non - small - cell carcinoma ; ( ii ) the origin of a549 cell was obtained from lung tissue and h460 was from lung pleural effusion , which may represent different stages of lung cancer ; and ( iii ) both cells are egfr wild type that could be tested by the drugs potentially effective for intrinsic egfr - tki resistance .
we conducted meta - analysis using the p values from cmap drugs obtained from individual arrays .
as shown in table 10 , the first row lists the early - and late - stage es and p value used for meta - analysis .
entries in the lower diagonal denote the number of common drugs for ma choosing es and p value as the effective sizes , and , in contrast , entries in upper - diagonal show its jaccard index ( ji ) score .
given two sets a and b , ji ( a , b ) is defined as | aintersectionb | /(| a | union | b | - | aintersectionb |) , where | aintersectionb | , | a | and | b | denote the cardinality of aintersectionb , a and b , respectively .
for early - stage cancer , there are five common drugs ( ji is 0.156 ) predicted by both es and cmap p value meta - analysis , whereas there are ten common drugs ( ji is 0.217 ) for late - stage cancer .
the number of common drugs for both early - and late - stage cancer are around five or six , assuming es versus p value .
there are sixteen ( ji = 0.421 ) and six ( ji = 0.182 ) common drugs predicted by es and p value meta - analysis , respectively .
this seems to indicate that ma tends to return a higher overlapping between early - and late - stage results .
we submitted the selected drugs to drugbank and ncbi to search for up - and downregulated target genes .
the results of the number of target genes are summarized in table 11 , which are potential therapeutic targets for future lung cancer clinical trials .
for early - stage cancer , no target gene is reported by using the gse7670 platform ; therefore , we report common drug target genes among the rest of the other three microarray platforms .
for late - stage cancer , we report common drug target genes among any two of the three platforms .
table 12 summarizes the up - and down communities' drug target genes .
as it is shown in the table , certain genes are predicted by both effect size studies .
for instance , up community genes , rpl26l1 , fen1 , and idh1 , are found in both studies .
figure 3 depicts the ppi network of upregulated target genes using cytoscape [ 80 ] .
the upregulated target gene rpl26l1 directly interacts with six proteins ; figure 4 represents the ppi network of downregulated target gene , pparg .
this gene directly interacts with eleven proteins .
4. conclusion we applied the meta - analysis technique to infer therapeutic drugs for nsclc treatment by integrating microarray expression profiles .
since cancer is a multistage progressive disease , early - and late - stage cag are potentially very different ; therefore , stage - specific degs were identified .
ppi data were then employed to construct dense ppi modules .
the up - and downregulated communities were used as queries to perform functional enrichment analysis and potential drug identification using cmap .
drugs can act on not merely the transcription level , but rather on the protein , posttranscription , or posttranslation levels .
large - scale drug screening needs fast and efficient ways .
in the current status , using gene expression change to infer drug repositioning is the most suitable way , which has been claimed in the rationale of cmap original paper [ 81 ] .
it is still difficult to see the modulations of protein level in such a large - scale , high throughput method .
enrichment analysis suggests pathways that are early - and late - stage specific .
this supports the use of the meta - analysis technique to derive reliable results when combining multiple gene expression datasets .
enrichment scores and p values obtained from cmap were adopted as the effect size indices for target drug meta - analysis .
certain common drugs were found by using the enrichment score and p value meta - analysis technique .
a fraction of our drug findings results are supported by ic50 experimental data .
our findings suggest that certain up - and downregulated genes are potential drug targets .
furthermore , the drugs derived from drugbank and ncbi are potential lung cancer therapeutic drugs .
in summary , we have developed a pipeline to infer therapeutic drugs for disease treatment by integrating microarray , ppi , and the cmap resources .
meta - analysis was adopted to integrate multiple datasets .
up - and downregulated communities were used as queries to perform functional enrichment analysis and potential drug prediction .
overrepresented cancer stage - specific pathways are determined .
the target drug results are supported by ic50 measurement data .
it is expected that the approach developed in the current work should be of value for future studies into understanding the molecular mechanism of lung cancer formation and identifying therapeutic drug targets .

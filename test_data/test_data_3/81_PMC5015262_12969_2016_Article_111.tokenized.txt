the deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 ( dada2 ) is a new autoinflammatory disease characterised by an early onset vasculopathy with livedoid skin rash associated with systemic manifestations , cns involvement and mild immunodeficiency .
this condition is secondary to autosomal recessive mutations of cecr1 ( cat eye syndrome chromosome region 1 ) gene , mapped to chromosome 22q11.1 , that encodes for the enzymatic protein adenosine deaminase 2 ( ada2 ). by now 19 different mutations in cecr1 gene have been detected .
the pathogenetic mechanism of dada2 is still unclear .
ada2 in a secreted protein mainly expressed by cells of the myeloid lineage ; its enzymatic activity is higher in conditions of hypoxia , inflammation and oncogenesis .
moreover ada2 is able to induce macrophages proliferation and differentiation ; it 's deficiency is in fact associated with a reduction of anti - inflammatory macrophages ( m2 ) .
the deficiency of ada2 is also associated with an up - regulation of neutrophils - expressed genes and an increased secretion of pro - inflammatory cytokines .
the mild immunodeficiency detected in many dada2 patients suggests a role of this protein in the adaptive immune response ; an increased mortality of b cells and a reduction in the number of memory b cells , terminally differentiated b cells and plasmacells has been described in many patients .
the lack of the protein is associated with endothelium damage ; however the function of this protein in the endothelial homeostasis is still unknown. from the clinical point of view , this disease is characterized by a wide spectrum of severity .
chronic or recurrent systemic inflammation with fever , elevation of acute phase reactants and skin manifestations ( mainly represented by livedo reticularis ) is the typical clinical picture .
while in some patients the disease is mild and skin - limited , others present a severe , even lethal , disease with multi - organ involvement ; the cns involvement is rather common with ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes .
in many patients not only the clinical picture but also the histopathologic features are undistinguishable from those of systemic polyarteritis nodosa ( pan ). of note , patients with an unusual phenotype , mainly dominated by clinical manifestations suggestive for an immune - disrective condition , have been described .
due to its rarity , the response to treatment of dada2 is still anecdotal .
while steroids can control the disease 's manifestations at high dosage , none of the common immunosuppressive drugs turned out to be effective .
biologic drugs have been used only in few patients , without a clear effectiveness ; anti - tnf drugs are those associated to a better clinical response .
hematopoietic stem cells transplantation was effective in patients with a severe phenotype .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background the deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 ( dada2 ) is a recently identified disease , gathered in the family of autoinflammatory diseases , mainly characterised by early - onset polyarteritis , hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes and hypogammaglobulinemia .
in february 2014 two independent studies , one held by the american national institutes of health in bethesda [ 1 ] and the other one by the israeli sharee zedek medical center in jerusalem [ 2 ] , identified this new clinical entity , often familial , characterised by early onset livedoid rash associated with systemic inflammation ( fever and elevation of acute phase reactants ) .
some patients presented ischemic or haemorrhagic cerebral stroke , other vasculopathy - related manifestations ( hypertension , gastrointestinal symptoms ) , hepatosplenomegaly , peripheral neuropathy and mild immunodeficiency .
in many cases both the clinical manifestations and the histological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa ( pan ) , with childhood - onset .
the analysis of the whole exome - sequencing ( wes ) in unrelated affected patients identified autosomal recessive deleterious mutations in cecr1 gene , encoding for adenosine deaminase 2 ( ada2 ) .
the marked reduction of both plasmatic levels and enzymatic activity of ada2 detected in affected patients respect to healthy donors [ 1 , 2 ] , confirmed the hypothesis that the causative mutation determines the loss - of - function of the protein .
the non - affected simple - heterozygous parents displayed intermediate values of both plasmatic levels and enzymatic activity [ 1 ] .
cecr1 gene the cecr1 ( cat eye syndrome chromosome region 1 ) gene , mapped to chromosome 22q11.1 and constituted by 10 exons [ 1 , 2 ] , encodes for the enzyme adenosine deaminase 2 ( ada2 ) , a protein composed by 4 domains : the signal sequence , the dimerization domain , the putative receptor - binding domain and the catalytic domain .
the mutations detected in cecr1 gene so far are 19 , with a different prevalence according to patient 's ethnicity ( table 1 , fig. 1 ) [ 1 - 13 ] .
the g47r mutation has been detected in homozygous state in all patients of georgian jewish and turkish origin .
based on the results of the molecular analysis performed in 246 healthy donors of georgian jewish origin , the estimated frequency of this mutation in this population is 10 % [ 2 ] .

the mutations so far detected affect the signal peptide ( n = 2 ) , the 5 ' untranslated region ( n = 1 ) , the dimerization domain ( n = 4 ) , the putative receptor binding ( n = 1 ) and the catalytic domain ( n = 11 ) ( table 1 , fig. 1 ) [ 1 - 13 ] .
moreover two patients with a homozygous deletion on 22.11.1 chromosome ( encompassing cecr1 gene ) have been recently described [ 14 ] .
ada2 protein and pathogenetic mechanisms the enzyme adenosine deaminase ( ada ) plays a key role in the purine metabolism converting adenosine to inosine and 2 ' - deoxyadenosine to 2 ' - deoxyinosine [ 15 ] .
the two major ada isoforms are ada1 , whose deficiency is cause of a severe combined immunodeficiency ( scid ) [ 16 ] , and ada2 .
even if the two proteins have partial structural homology , the two isoenzymes differ in many aspects : the affinity of ada2 for molecules of adenosine and deoxy - adenosine is about 100 times lower than that of ada1 ; consequently , at physiological concentrations of substrate , the deaminase activity of ada2 is almost absent [ 17 ] .
while ada1 is monomeric and acts primarily intracellularly , ada2 is dimeric and secreted in the extracellular environment where it exerts its main functions .
for this reason ada2 is clearly detectable in the plasma .
finally , while ada1 is ubiquitally expressed in all cell types , ada2 is mostly expressed by monocytes and other cells of the myeloid lineage [ 17 ] .
ada2 is more stable at high temperatures and the optimum ph for its activity is generally acid ( about 6.5 ) , which suggests a specialized role of this enzyme in conditions of hypoxia , inflammation and oncogenesis ; in these conditions its deaminase activity is higher [ 17 ] ( fig. 2 ). fig. 2 production and physiological role of adenosine deaminase 2 ( ada2 ) .
ada2 is produced and secreted by cells of myeloid lineage ; it exerts its enzymatic activity in the extracellular space , especially in the presence of a low ph or high temperature .
on monocytes ( a ) ada2 acts as growth - factor with an autocrine activity : it induces monocytes' proliferation and promote the differentiation of m2 anti - inflammatory macrophages .
on neutrophils ( b ) ada2 induces the gene of expression of some pro - inflammatory proteins , such as myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) and neutrophils' activations , leading to the secretion of pro - inflammatory cytokines .
there are indirect evidences of a possible role of ada2 as growth - factor for endothelial cells ( c ) the capacity of binding receptors involved in the signal transduction of different pathways ( such as proteoglycans ) , confers to ada2 a growth - factor like action ; for this reason ada2 is considered an adenosine deaminase - related growth - factor ( adgf ) [ 17 - 19 ] ( fig. 2 ) .
ada2 displays also an autocrine activity : the protein , released by activated monocytes , is able to induce monocyte proliferation and macrophage differentiation [ 20 ] ; cecr1 silencing in myeloid cells is in fact associated to a reduced differentiation of monocytes to macrophages [ 1 ] .
this activity has been demonstrated to be mediated by the direct binding of cellular receptors , and therefore to be independent from the enzymatic activity [ 20 ] ( fig. 2 ) .
ada2 seems to be also involved in the balance between pro - inflammatory ( m1 ) and anti - inflammatory ( m2 ) monocytes ; its absence has been in fact associated with a defect in differentiation of m2 macrophages , which leads to a prevalence of pro - inflammatory m1 cells [ 1 ] .
microarray analysis in two dada2 patients showed a marked up - regulation of neutrophils - expressed genes .
intracellular staining revealed an increased expression of myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to controls [ 8 ] ( fig. 2 ) .
according with these findings , the assessment of cytokine levels performed in the serum of few described patients revealed an increase of pro - inflammatory cytokines : in the two patients carrying a homozygous deletion of 22q11.1 chromosome increased levels of both il - 1beta and tnfalpha were detected [ 14 ] , while in another case the detection of il - 6 revealed increased levels [ 7 ] .
these data are in contrast with the results obtained in the nih study , in which the cytokine assay performed in the supernatants of the whole blood cell cultured with different stimuli did not reveal any significant difference between patients and healthy donors [ 1 ] .
further studies on larger series of patients are therefore needed in order to investigate the cytokines' pattern in dada2 ; in particular the cytokines' production should be assessed in stimulated pbmcs and should take into consideration the disease activity .
it has been also postulated that the deregulation of purinergic stimulation , due to the decrease of the enzymatic activity of ada2 , may play a pro - inflammatory role .
adenosine is in fact an important signaling molecule that can modulate the inflammatory response ; its concentration in tissues is normally low and increases in condition of cellular stress , ischemia or inflammation [ 21 ] .
the accumulation of adenosine can influence the inflammatory response by binding several receptors that lead to inflammation , tissue damage and fibrosis [ 21 ] .
however , the plasmatic levels of adenosine and deoxiadenosine in few dada2 patients has been detected within the normal range [ 1 , 2 ] .
since hypogammaglobulinemia has been described in some patients , adaptive immunity has been investigated in ada2 patients .
a reduction in the number of memory b cells , terminally differentiated b cells and plasmacells has been described [ 1 , 7 ] ; moreover co - culture experiments have enlightened an increased mortality of b cells [ 1 ] .
not univocal results have been detected concerning the t cells function .
in fact , while in the nih study ada2 mutations seem not to affect t lymphocyte number and activation [ 1 ] , in a more recent study an increase of regulatory t cells and a decrease of cd8 + and cd4 + memory t cells have been detected in one patient with dada2 [ 7 ] .
in addition a reduced number of th1 , th2 and follicular t helper ( tfh ) cells has been observed in the same patient .
the reason why endothelium represents the main target of inflammation in dada2 is still largely unknown .
ada2 acts as a growth - factor for endothelial cells .
in fact , even if it has been demonstrated that endothelial cells do not express cecr1 gene , the deficiency of ada2 is associated to a damage of vascular endothelium and to an over expression of activation markers [ 1 ] .
the knockdown animal model for cecr1 gene ( zebrafish ) displays cerebral haemorrhages without morphologic alteration in the vascular structure ; these episodes recovered following the transfection of non - mutant human cecr1 messenger rna [ 1 ] .
in the same way , monocytes of patients with dada2 led to destruction of co - cultured human microvascular endothelial cells [ 1 ] .
due to the rarity of the disease , all available data on the pathogenic consequences of ada2 defect in humans come from few patients ; further studies are therefore needed in order to better enlighten the activity of ada2 in the innate and adaptive immune response and its role in the endothelium homeostasis .
clinical manifestations dada2 can be defined as an inflammatory vasculopathy with a wide range of clinical manifestations , possibly associated with an immunodeficiency of variable severity .
the disease is mainly characterized by chronic or recurrent systemic inflammation with fever and elevation of acute phase reactants , usually associated with different possible skin manifestations , ranging from the most frequent livedo reticularis ( fig. 3 ) to maculopapular rash , nodules , purpura , erythema nodosum , raynaud 's phenomenon , ulcerative lesions , digital necrosis [ 1 , 2 ]. fig. 3 livedo reticularis in a patient with dada2 the clinical picture is wide , ranging form a mild disease with a late onset skin - limited involvement to a very severe systemic phenotype ( even fatal ) with an early onset and a multi - organ involvement ( tables 2 and 3 ) .

in most patients , a neurological involvement , affecting both the peripheral and central nervous system , has been described .
the severity of the cns involvement is rather variable .
in some patients a transitorily ischemic attack ( tia ) has been described ( with negative cerebral ct and / or mri ) , while others developed an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke ( in few cases a ventricular haemorrhage has also been detected ) .
typically , the strokes associated to dada2 are lacunar with a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from clinically silent episodes in few cases , to severe ones leading to a permanent disability [ 1 , 2 , 10 , 12 ] .
the neuropathy ranges from a transient mononeuritis ( such as a cranial nerve transient paralysis ) to a permanent polyneuropathy ; moreover , few patients suffered from optic neuritis .
in few cases , persistent neurosensorial hearing loss has also been described [ 1 , 2 , 12 ] .
most patients have gastrointestinal manifestations : abdominal pain , significant weight loss , chronic gastritis , hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , portal hypertension , bowel perforation or stenosis .
while nephrogenic hypertension is rather common in this condition , in few patients focal glomerulosclerosis and renal amyloidosis have also been described [ 11 ] .
lung involvement with necrotising pneumonia ( lethal ) has been reported in one patient [ 11 ] .
the blood tests usually reveal an elevation of acute phase reactants ( ers , crp ) , low haemoglobin levels and neutrophilic leukocytosis [ 1 , 2 ] ; however in few patients cytopenia ( pancytopenia , leucopoenia ) has been detected [ 1 , 7 , 12 ] .
auto - antibody are usually negative .
as stated above , a mild immunodeficiency can be observed ; some patients present hypogammaglobulinemia that may affect igm or all ig subclasses [ 1 , 13 ]. of note , despite the low immunoglobulins' levels , only few cases displayed an increased susceptibility to infections , that was rather severe in exceptional cases [ 1 , 3 , 7 , 12 , 13 ] .
mri is the most useful tool in the diagnosis of cerebral strokes ; in fact ct scan as well as conventional angiography may not detect the smaller lacunar strokes and therefore underestimate the entity of involvement of the cns [ 1 ] .
some patients underwent an angiographic investigation , that revealed the presence of stenosis and / or aneurysms of abdominal artery , particularly mesenteric , celiac , hepatic and renal arteries ; the histological analysis , when done , revealed a necrotizing vasculitis [ 1 , 2 ] .
in patients with symptoms suggestive for organ involvement but without pathologic finding in not - invasive radiologic studies , conventional angiography can be of help revealing aneurism and or stenosis in the middle sizes arteries .
skin biopsy revealed , in most cases , a non - granulomatous , necrotizing vasculitis of small and medium - sized vessels , with the same histopathologic features of polyarteritis nodosa [ 1 , 2 , 9 ] .
in few cases the histology was less specific showing a leucocytoclastic vasculitis or a panniculitis .
polyarteritis nodosa ( pan ) is , according to the chapel hill classification , a " necrotizing arteritis of medium or small arteries without glomerulonephritis or vasculitis in arterioles , capillaries , or venules , and not associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ancas )" [ 22 ] .
it 's gathered in the medium - sized vessels vasculitis , even if it can affect arteries of any size [ 22 ] .
being dada2 a vasculitis with a genetic basis , it has been proposed to group this disease in the vasculitis with a probable cause according to the chapel hill classification [ 11 , 22 ] .
notably , most of the dada2 patients not only received the histological diagnosis of pan but also met the eular / printo / pres diagnostic criteria for childhood polyarteritis nodosa ( table 4 ) [ 23 ] .
table 4 eular / printo / pres classification criteria for childhood polyarteritis nodosa ( pan ) [ 23 ] histopathology or angiographic abnormalities ( mandatory ) plus one of the five following criteria : - histology : necrotising vasculitis in medium or small - sized arteries .
- angiography : aneurysm , stenosis or occlusion of a medium or small sized artery , eular / printo / pres classification criteria for childhood polyarteritis nodosa ( c - pan ) 1 .
skin involvement livedo reticularis , skin nodules , superficial ulcers , peripheral tissue necrosis 2 .
myalgia / muscle tenderness muscle pain or tenderness 3 .
hypertension blood pressure > 95th centile 4 .
peripheral neuropathy sensory or motor neuropathy 5 .
renal involvement proteinuria , haematuria , impaired function unusual phenotypes even if most of the patients with dada2 have a clinical phenotype consistent with a systemic inflammatory vasculopathy , a recent report has enlighten that the disease may be dominated by clinical manifestations suggestive for an immune - disrective condition , such as cytopenia , lymphadenopathy , hepatosplenomegaly and immunodeficiency with severe viral infections [ 7 ] .
the two patients described did not present skin involvement and one of them developed a vascular involvement only after bone - marrow transplantation. of note , the mutations found in these two patients were the same described in patients with a " typical " inflammatory clinical picture .
similarly a third patient with a lymphoprolipherative clinical picture , resembling castleman 's syndrome , has been reported by the same group [ 5 ] .
a more recent clinical series of 9 dada2 patients with the homozygous r169q mutation has enlightened that the presence of cytopenia is a common finding of the disease , together with the common inflammatory manifestations [ 12 ] .
in the two patients carrying homozygous 22q11.1 deletion , encompassing both copies of the il - 17 receptor a ( il17ra ) and the cecr1 gene , the clinical phenotype was dominated by muco - cutaneous infections and dermatitis associated to persistent inflammation and , in one patient , vasculitis responding to steroids [ 14 ] .
livedo reticularis , stroke and other dada2 clinical manifestations were not described .
finally two brothers with a clinical picture consistent with the diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency ( cvid ) were found to be affected by dada2 by whole exome - sequencing ; of note only one of them displayed clinical sign and symptoms consistent with a vasculopathy [ 13 ] .
outcome being a disease of recent identification , the clinical outcome has not been well investigated .
however , from the clinical data by now available is clear that the spectrum of severity of the disease is wide , ranging from patients with neonatal onset and a severe organ involvement to patients with onset in the adulthood and the presence of only skin manifestations ( tables 2 and 3 ) ; of note , even between patients carrying the same mutations in cecr1 gene the clinical picture can be widely different ( tables 2 and 3 ) .
the disease turned out to be lethal in seven out of the 65 patients by now described [ 1 , 2 , 6 , 13 , 14 ] : in three cases the severity of the visceral involvement was lethal [ 1 , 2 ] , two patients died for respiratory complications following intracranial haemorrhage [ 6 , 13 ] , while one patient developed necrotising pneumonia [ 1 , 11 ] ; finally one of the two patients carrying the homozygous deletion on 22.11.1 chromosome died for septic shock .
treatment dada2 is a newly recognised condition and the number of patients so far described is limited ; for this reason the response to treatment is largely anecdotal and still controversial ( table 5 ) .

( 1 ) poor response being an inflammatory condition , high doses of steroids are usually able to control the clinical manifestations [ 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 ] .
however , due to the severity of the condition , a steroid - dependence is often described .
none of the most common immunosuppressive drugs ( cyclophosphamide , azathioprine , methotrexate ) was effective [ 1 , 2 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 13 ] .
navon et al. reported ten patients treated with anti - tnf drugs ( etanercept , adalimumab , infliximab ) with complete response in 8 , even after the failure of immunosuppressive therapies [ 2 ] ; good results with anti - tnf agents were also reported in other small series [ 3 , 11 , 12 ]. by now , the reason why this drug is effective is still unclear .
according to the report of zhou et al. , neither immunosuppressive nor biologic drugs were able to completely control the disease manifestations in all treated patients ; the enzymatic substitutive treatment ( fresh frozen plasma or recombinant enzyme ) was postulated to be of help .
this approach was tempted in two patients reported by batu et al. with a transient good response in one and a not - satisfactory response in the other [ 11 ] .
a possible role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) has been postulated to be effective by zhou et al. and navon et al. , being able to provide ada2 producing monocytes and therefore to normalize the plasmatic levels of the enzyme [ 1 , 2 ] .
this therapeutic strategy , performed in one of the two patients reported by van eyck et al .
[ 7 ] and in a patient reported by the nih group [ 3 ] , was able to normalize the plasmatic levels of ada2 and to control the disease manifestations [ 3 , 7 ] ; early complications occurred in one of them .
more recently two additive patients who displayed a complete response to hsct have been described [ 12 ] .
van eyck et al. conclude that hsct should be suggested only for those patients with a severe disease , since dada2 patients present an increased risk of hsct - related complications due to the persistent inflammation and the compromised endothelial integrity [ 7 ]. of note , the other patient described in this paper displayed a complete response to treatment with sirolimus ; the authors assume that this drug may be of help in the control of the clinical manifestations related to ada2 - deficiency , being able to reduce the m1 macrophage differentiation and the production of il - 6 [ 7 ] .
conclusion in conclusion dada2 is a genetic condition mainly characterized by an inflammatory vasculopathy resembling polyarteritis nodosa ( pan ). from the clinical data so far available , the age at onset , the disease manifestations and severity are widely variable .
further clinical studies are therefore needed in order to better understand the phenotypic viability of this condition and the genotype - phenotype correlation .
in light of the data by now available , we consider the genetic analysis of cecr1 gene suggested in the following clinical pictures : patients with an inflammatory vasculopathy with early onset in infancy , patients with a diagnosis of pan or cpan with early onset and / or severe organ involvement ( above all stroke ) , especially in case of a positive family history or consanguinity / endogamy in the parents .
moreover dada2 should be ruled out in patients with an immune - disreactive condition without an underlying diagnosis , especially in presence of signs or symptoms of vasculitis .
finally , a better enlightenment of the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease is needed ; these data will be of help also in the identification of an effective treatment .

humans die from age - related diseases , which are deadly manifestations of the aging process .
in order to extend life span , an anti - aging drug must delay age - related diseases .
all together age - related diseases are the best biomarker of aging .
once a drug is used for treatment of any one chronic disease , its effect against other diseases ( atherosclerosis , cancer , prostate enlargement , osteoporosis , insulin resistance , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's diseases , age - related macular degeneration ) may be evaluated in the same group of patients .
if the group is large , then the anti - aging effect could be validated in a couple of years .
startlingly , retrospective analysis of clinical and preclinical data reveals four potential anti - aging modalities .
anti - aging drugs diseases cancer atherosclerosis resveratrol rapamycin metformin problem the discovery of anti - aging drugs is no longer a fantasy .
numerous genes for aging and longevity have been identified in diverse organisms , revealing potential targets for potential anti - aging drugs .
but how could potential anti - aging drug be introduced to humans ?
there are two problems .
first , the effect of anti - aging agents on human aging may require almost a lifetime to determine [ 1 ] .
second , it is seemingly desirable to test anti - aging drugs in healthy individuals .
however , all drugs have side effects. and , in healthy individuals , side effects would preclude clinical trials .
how might these problems be solved ?
how could we validate anti - aging drugs in humans without life - long trials in healthy individuals ?
solution the solution includes two steps .
first , we must find an indication for a drug to treat at least one chronic disease .
then this drug could be tested in humans , not as an anti - aging drug , but as therapy for a particular disease .
in fact this approach has been suggested for introduction of activators of sirtuins to the clinic [ 2,3 ] .
second , we must find a biomarker of aging that absolutely predicts longevity .
then using this biomarker , the anti - aging effect could be evaluated in the same patients .
aging and age - related diseases aging can be defined as an increase in the probability of death .
this is how the rate of aging can be measured .
humans die not from ' healthy ' aging but from age - related diseases .
healthy aging ( a late onset of disease ) is associated with longevity .
for example , centenarians show significant delay in the onset of age - related diseases , including cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes , cancer and alzheimer 's disease .
in other words , those who live longer are healthier and vice versa [ 4,5 ] .
since , by definition , all age - dependent diseases are connected with aging , these diseases are connected to each other .
in fact , aging humans often suffer from many diseases simultaneously : diabetes , atherosclerosis , hypertension , macular degeneration , prostate enlargement and prostate cancer ( in men ) or breast cancer ( in women ) , alzheimer 's disease and osteoarthritis .
this is why elimination of one disease ( e.g. , cancer ) will not radically extend maximal human lifespan. and as calculated , " the complete resolution of alzheimer 's disease would add about 19 days onto average life expectancy " [ 6 ] .
but if a drug delays or stops all diseases , a person must live longer .
otherwise what would be the cause of death , if all causes were delayed ?
since human longevity is limited by death from age - related diseases , a true anti - aging drug must delay age - related diseases .
in other words , unless a drug delays age - related diseases , it will not extend lifespan. and vice versa , if a drug prevents age - related diseases , it must extend life span .
biomarker of organismal aging given that ( a ) an increase in the death rate is a measure of aging and ( b ) the death rate is determined diseases taken together , then we can conclude that the sum of all age - related diseases is the best biomarker of aging .
any one age - related disease is not a biomarker of aging because , in addition to aging , numerous factors contribute to the incidence of a particular disease .
for example , smoking increases the risk for lung cancer but not for parkinson 's disease .
yet , aging is a risk factor for both diseases. and , even for lung cancer , aging is a bigger risk factor than is smoking .
aging is the biggest risk factor for all age - related diseases. whether aging and disease have a common mechanism or whether aging simply increases vulnerability to diseases , in any case , the inhibition of aging will delay diseases , thus extending life span .
disease - specific drugs versus anti - aging agents slowing aging would delay all age - related diseases .
if a drug is effective against one particular disease only , such a drug is not anti - aging. and current drugs are not anti - aging .
for example , insulin compensates diabetes .
yet , insulin does not treat cancer. and vice versa chemotherapy may treat cancer but does not treat diabetes .
so neither chemotherapy nor insulin is an anti - aging modality .
furthermore , both insulin and chemotherapy may accelerate aging .
metformin the underlying cause of age - related type ii diabetes is insulin resistance .
insulin treatment does not ' treat ' the cause , it just compensates for resistance .
unlike insulin , metformin , an oral anti - diabetic drug , restores insulin sensitivity in type diabetes type ii. remarkably , metformin decreases the incidence of breast cancer [ 7,8 ] .
also , metformin is considered for cancer treatment [ 9 ] and inhibits atherosclerosis in diabetic mice [ 10 ] .
metformin is used to induce ovulation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) .
six months of 1700 mg / d metformin treatment improved fertility in anovulatory pcos women [ 11,12 ] .
given such effects on infertility , type ii diabetes , cancer and atherosclerosis , it is plausible that metformin slows aging .
in fact , it extends life span in rodents [ 13 - 15 ] .
calorie restriction calorie restriction ( cr ) extends life span from yeast and worms to rodents and perhaps humans [ 16 - 18 ] .
if we did not already know that cr slows aging , how might we figure that out based solely on clinical data ?
unrestricted food consumption leads to obesity associated with diabetes , atherosclerosis , thrombosis , hypertension , cancer ( especially breast , prostate and colon cancer ) , coronary heart disease , stroke , osteoporosis and alzheimer 's disease [ 19 - 25 ] .
in other words , unrestricted eating in humans ( ad libitum in rodents ) accelerates most , if not all , diseases of aging .
so we can conclude that cr delays all diseases of aging .
this suggests that cr is an anti - aging modality. and it is known that cr extends life span in almost all organisms from yeast to mammals. from metformin and calorie restriction to rapamycin numerous factors including insulin , glucose and amino acids activate the nutrient - sensing tor ( target of rapamycin ) pathway .
when the tor pathway is activated , it acts via s6k to deplete the insulin - receptor - substrate ( irs1 / 2 ) , causing insulin resistance ( figure 1 ) .
as shown in figure 1 , metformin indirectly ( by activating ampk ) inhibits tor and thereby restores insulin sensitivity [ 26 ] .
cr decreases levels of nutrients and insulin and thus de - activates tor ( figure 1 ) .
it is possible that the anti - aging effects of cr and metformin are due to inhibition of the tor pathway .
like cr , rapamycin decreases size of fat cells and animal weight .
when rats ( 15 weeks old ) were either treated 1 mg / kg rapamycin 3 times per week for 12 weeks , rapamycin decreased their weight .
mean adipocyte diameter was decreased from 36 mum to 25 mum .
at the end of the study , mean body weight in the rapamycin - treated rats was 356 g instead of 507 g , in spite of comparable food intake [ 27 ] .
so rapamycin imitated cr. cr may also extend life span by activating sirtuins .
probably , sirtuins , ampk and mtor are linked in the common network [ 28 ] .
genetic inhibition of the tor pathway slows down aging in diverse organisms , including yeast , worms , flies and mice [ 29 - 33 ] .
if genetic inhibition of the tor pathway slows aging , then rapamycin , a drug that inhibits tor , must slow aging too .
once used for any indication , even unrelated to age - related diseases ( such as renal transplantation , for instance ) , an anti - aging drug should slow down age - related diseases such as cancer , osteoporosis and atherosclerosis .
rapamycin is already used in renal transplant patients .
figure 1 .
the tor intracellular signaling pathway .
nutrients , gf ( growth factors ) and insulin activate the tor pathway , which is involved in aging and age - related diseases .
other genetic factors and environmental factors ( e.g. , smoking ) contribute to specific age - related diseases .
three potential anti - aging modalities ( metformin , calorie restriction and rapamycin ) all inhibit the tor pathway .
retrospective analysis of the clinical use of rapamycin rapamycin has been used in renal - transplant patients for several years .
since rapamycin was viewed as an immunossupressive drug ( not as an anti - aging drug ) it was expected that it would cause cancer .
unexpectedly , it turned out that rapamycin prevented cancer , and even cured pre - existing cancer and kaposi 's sarcoma in renal transplant patients [ 34 - 44 ] .
furthermore , temsirolimus , an analog of rapamycin , has recently been approved for cancer therapy [ 45 ] .
also , everolimus , a tor inhibitor , markedly delayed tumor development in transgenic mice that spontaneously develop ovarian carcinomas [ 46 ] .
would tor inhibitors extend life span in transgenic mice ?
since rapamycin delays cancer , it must prolong the life span of cancer - prone mice , who would otherwise die from cancer. of course , humans die from a variety of age - related diseases , not from just one disease .
to prolong life span dramatically , rapamycin must delay most of them .
in renal transplant patients , rapamycin increases blood lipoproteins [ 47 ] .
this is considered to be a negative side effect .
yet , this results from mobilization of fat from the fat tissue ( lipolysis ) [ 48,49 ] .
this is exactly what happens during starvation or calorie restriction ( cr ). and cr extends life span .
furthermore , rapamycin reduces the accumulation of cholesterol within the arterial wall [ 50,51 ] .
thus , lipolysis of fat tissue and decreased uptake of cholesterol by tissues both contribute to high levels of lipids in blood ( figure 2 ) .
despite hypercholesterolemia , rapamycin prevents atherosclerosis in animals [ 52 ] .
in animal models , systemic administration of rapamycin reduces neointimal thickening and slows the progression of atherosclerosis in apoe - deficient mice with elevated levels of cholesterol [ 53 - 55 ] .
in patients with coronary atherosclerosis , oral rapamycin prevents re - stenosis after implantation of metal stents [ 56 ] .
as a case report , it has been described that conversion to everolimus ( an analog of rapamycin ) resulted in decrease in blood pressure [ 57 ] .
in kidney transplant patients , 2 years after transplantation , body - mass index was significantly lower in the rapamycin - based treatment arm compared to cyclosporine [ 27 ] .
figure 2 .
re - interpretation of the hyperlipidemic side effect of rapamycin .
rapamycin activates adipose tissue lipase , thus mobilizing lipids from the fat tissue ( lipolysis ) .
this effect imitates starvation .
also , rapamycin inhibits lipoprotein lipase thus preventing utilization of lipids by the fat tissue and blocking lipid uptake by the arterial wall .
this results in increase in blood lipids .
multiple indications for a single drug if a drug is indicated to treat most age - related diseases , then this drug could be defined as an anti - aging drug .
the probability that a non - anti - aging drug would have independent activities against all diseases is exceedingly low .
rapamycin analogs are approved to treat certain cancers [ 45 ] .
based on preclinical data , rapamycin has been considered in such pathologies as obesity [ 58 ] , atherosclerosis [ 53 - 55 ] , cardiac hypertrophy [ 59 - 64 ] , aortic aneurysm [ 65 ] , osteoporosis [ 66 - 68 ] , organ fibrosis ( liver , renal , cardiac fibrosis ) [ 64,69,70 - 75 ] , neurodegeneration [ 76,77 ] , alzheimer 's disease [ 78,79 ] , parkinson 's disease [ 80 - 82 ] , psoriasis [ 80 ] , skin scars and keloids [ 83 ] , multiple sclerosis [ 84 ] , arthritis [ 85,86 ] , and renal hypertrophy in diabetes [ 87 ] .
may rapamycin increase human life span ?
in principle , life - extending effect of anti - aging drug might be limited by side effects .
although chronic administration of rapamycin is associated with some undesirable effects in transplant patients ( see for references [ 88 ]) , they might be avoided by administrating rapamycin in pulses ( for example , once a week ) .
for example , chronic administration of rapamycin impairs wound healing .
in theory , a pulse treatment might rejuvenate wound - healing cells [ 88 ] .
a single dose of rapamycin reverses insulin resistance , whereas chronic administration of rapamycin may precipitate diabetes in certain conditions .
clinical trials will be needed to determine benefits of pulse treatment with rapamycin .
alternatively , rapamycin can be combined with ' complementary ' drugs .
thus , hyperlipidemia caused by rapamycin may deteriorate insulin - resistance .
yet , hyperlipidemia caused by rapamycin can be controlled by lipid - lowering drugs .
a combination of rapamycin with resveratrol may be especially intriguing .
resveratrol resveratrol , an activator of sirt1 in mammals , extends life span in diverse species [ 89,90 ] .
resveratrol was shown to prevent cancer , atherosclerosis , neuro - degeneration and insulin - resistance ( diabetes type ii ) [ 10,91 - 100 ] .
resveratrol also indirectly inhibits pi - 3k / mtor / s6k pathway [ 101 - 105 ] .
sirt1 and mtor could be members of the same sirtuin / tor network .
the link between tor and sirtuins has been suggested [ 28 ] .
it is likely that tor ( pro - aging pathway ) and sirtuins ( anti - aging pathway ) antagonize each other [ 106 ] .
however , inhibition of the tor pathway by resveratrol occurs at near - toxic concentrations [ 107 ] .
the ability of resveratrol to extend life span may be limited by its toxicity at high doses due to off - target effects .
therefore , more selective activators of sirt1 undergo clinical trials [ 3 ] .
importantly , these drugs will be developed to treat age - related diseases such as type 2 diabetes [ 3 ] .
this is the only possible strategy for a drug to enter the clinic .
but here is an additional aspect : this is the only practical way of how anti - aging effect can be evaluated too .
once used for treatment of diabetes , sirtuin activators might delay heart diseases , cancer , neurodegeneration and other age - related diseases in the same patients. and delaying of all diseases must extend life span , thus validating a drug as anti - aging .
conclusion it was previously assumed that anti - aging drugs should be tested in healthy individuals .
ironically , the best biomarker of aging is the occurrence of age - related diseases. and this is how anti - aging drugs can be validated in the clinic ( by showing that a putative anti - aging drug can prevent or delay the onset of all age - related diseases ) .
then such drugs could be approved for prevention of any particular age - related disease in healthy individuals .
thus , potential anti - aging drugs should be introduced to the clinical trials for therapy of a particular disease but be ultimately approved for prevention of all age - related diseases in healthy individuals. and this is synonymous to the approval of a drug as anti - aging .

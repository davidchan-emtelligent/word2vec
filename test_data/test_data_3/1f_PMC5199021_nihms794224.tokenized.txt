stem - cell niche is composed of a group of cells within the specific anatomic location that function to maintain stem cells .
the niche referring to a microenvironment is capable of generating extrinsic factors that modulate stem cell proliferation and fate determination [ 1 ] .
during development , various niche factors act on stem cells to alter gene expression , and induce their proliferation or differentiation for the development of the fetus .
the highly plastic state of the stem / progenitor cells during developmental and tissue maintenance permits the required flexibility for proper tissue formation and repair .
unfortunately , this plasticity also provides an opportunity for aberrant cellular reprogramming via epigenetic mechanisms due to inappropriate exposures to toxins [ 2 ] .
the developmental adverse exposure can lead to persistent , life - long effects and resulting in a variety of diseases [ 3 ] .
uterine fibroids ( ufs ) are monoclonal tumors arising from the myometrium .
an increasing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that ufs originate from stem cells in the myometrium , although the specific cell of origin for these tumors has remained elusive [ 4 , 5 ] .
the existence of stem cells from myometrium and ufs have been identified , and several studies have been performed to identify tumor - initiating cells in ufs [ 6 - 9 ] .
notably , the difference between myometrial stem cells ( mscs ) and fibroid stem cells at dna level is that med12 mutations were found only in fibroid stem cells , but not mscs [ 9 ] .
the med12 mutations occur in human uf tissues with high frequency in contrast to the findings that other gene mutation and genetic abnormalities occur at relatively low levels in ufs [ 10 , 11 ] .
recent study demonstrated that med12 mutation is a driver for promoting development of ufs and genomic instability [ 12 ] .
distinct med12 mutations have been detected in different fibroid lesions in the same uterus [ 13 ] suggesting that the emergence of each med12 mutation is an independent event in altered mscs .
endocrine disruptors ( eds ) are naturally occurring or man - made compounds that may interfere with the endocrine system and cause unfavorable developmental and reproductive effects on human .
increasing studies show that endocrine disruptors may pose the serious risk of many diseases during development [ 14 , 15 ] .
a number of studies demonstrate that estrogen clearly influences the proliferation and differentiation of various stem cell types .
epidemiological and experimental studies show that eds increase the risk of tumorigenesis , especially in the organs that are extremely sensitive to endocrine regulation .
in the eker rat fibroid model , developmental exposures to eds such as diethylstilbestrol and genistein during a crucial period of uteri development increase the penetrance and growth of ufs concomitantly reprogramming estrogen - responsive gene expression [ 16 - 18 ] .
the adverse effect of early life exposure may cause the deregulation of multiple developmental processes including disruption of stem cell niche , developmental reprogramming and altered stem cell characteristics .
the somatic stem / progenitor cells from varied tissues and organs have been shown to remain susceptible to eds [ 19 ] .
one of the important studies by bulun 's group showed that the differentiated myometrial cells in response to estrogen and progesterone treatment resulted in secretion of wingless - type ( wnt ) ligands , which induced nuclear translocation of beta - catenin in stem / progenitor cells from ufs .
the activation of beta - catenin pathway ultimately enhanced the cell growth and proliferation of these stem / progenitor cells [ 20 ] .
taken together , emerging studies suggest that the developmental exposure to eds and other toxins may result in genetic / epigenetic alterations and aberrant niche of mscs , thereby converting the mscs to tumor - initiating cells via a variety of signaling pathways .
thus further understanding of contributions of the stem cell micro - environment / reprogramming to development of ufs will be important for future clinical progress .

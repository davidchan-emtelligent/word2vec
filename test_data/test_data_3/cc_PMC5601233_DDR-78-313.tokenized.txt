abstract preclinical research bh3 mimetics are anticancer agents that reproduce the spatial arrangement of the bh3 domain of bcl - 2 family proteins .
just like the bh3 - only proteins , these compounds bind to the hydrophobic cleft of the pro - survival bcl - 2 members such as bcl - 2 or bcl - xl , and disrupt their heterodimerization with pro - apoptotic bax or bak , sensitizing cells to chemotherapy .
in recent years , it has become clear that bcl - 2 family proteins are engaged in regulation of intracellular ca2 + homeostasis , including ca2 + release from the intracellular stores as well as ca2 + fluxes across the plasma membrane .
given that bh3 mimetics shift the balance between the prosurvival and proapoptotic bcl - 2 members , they might indirectly exert effects on intracellular ca2 + signals .
indeed , it has been reported that some bh3 mimetics release ca2 + from the intracellular stores causing ca2 + overload in the cytosol .
therefore , the effects of any new bh3 mimetics on cellular ca2 + homeostasis should be tested before these compounds progress to clinical trials .

background the evolutionary conserved bcl - 2 ( b - cell lymphoma 2 ) protein family consists of about 18 members very well known for their role in the process of programmed cell death .
based on their structure and functions these proteins have been categorized into three groups : ( 1 ) the prosurvival members , such as bcl - 2 itself , along with bcl - xl , bcl - w or mcl - 1 ; ( 2 ) the proapoptotic proteins ( bax , bak ) ; ( 3 ) and a divergent class of the proapoptotic bh3 - only proteins , including bim , bid , puma , noxa , and others .
prosurvival bcl - 2 proteins bear four bh ( bcl - 2 homology ) domains and usually a transmembrane domain at the c - terminus .
bax and bak have three bh domains ( bh1 - bh3 ) but their helix alpha1 somewhat resembles the bh4 domain of bcl - xl [ suzuki et al. , 2000 ]. and the bh3 - only proteins have a single bh3 domain [ chipuk and green , 2008 ] .
the bh3 domain is an amphipathic alpha - helix , consisting of 9 - 16 amino acids with conserved residues of leucine ( leu ) and aspartic acid ( asp ) [ aouacheria et al. , 2015 ] , that is responsible for the interaction with the hydrophobic cleft formed by bh1 - bh3 domains of the pro - survival bcl - 2 proteins [ fesik , 2000 ; huang & strasser , 2000 ] .
in healthy cells , bak is already inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane , whereas bax is a cytosolic protein , with the capacity for translocation to the mitochondrial and er ( endoplasmic reticulum ) membranes upon activation .
according to the current dogma , even activated proapoptotic effectors bax and bak can be sequestrated and neutralized by the prosurvival bcl - 2 members [ kroemer et al. , 2007 ] .
upon reception of an apoptotic signal , one or more bh3 - only proteins undergo transcriptional or post - transcriptional activation .
activated bh3 - only proteins either antagonize the prosurvival bcl - 2 members (' sensitizers' or ' de - repressors ' , e.g. , noxa , puma , bad ) or also directly act on the proapoptotic effectors (' direct activators ' , e.g. , bid and bim ) , resulting in freeing bax or bak .
the last two undergo conformational changes and / or insertion ( bax ) into the outer mitochondrial membrane followed by oligomerization .
this leads to momp ( mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization ) , which is the key event in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [ kroemer et al. , 2007 ; chipuk & green , 2008 ] .
as a result , apoptogenic factors , such as cytochrome c , become released from the mitochondria triggering a downstream cascade of events , including caspase activation [ danial & korsmeyer , 2004 ] .
given that increased levels of bcl - 2 proteins have been reported in different cancer types correlating with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis [ miyashita & reed , 1993 ] , bcl - 2 proteins have become a viable target for anticancer therapy .
substantial efforts in this field yielded in development of synthetic compounds binding to the hydrophobic cleft of the pro - survival bcl - 2 proteins such as bcl - 2 and bcl - xl , which results in the inhibition of heterodimerization of the prosurvival and proapoptotic bcl - 2 family members .
this leads to the release and activation of bax and bak , followed by induction of apoptosis ( fig. 1 ) .
those largely terphenyl - based compounds have been termed bh3 mimetics as they reproduce the spatial arrangement of key amino acids in the bh3 domain .
in contrast to their prototypes , bh3 peptides , bh3 mimetics are characterized by better stability and therefore have a greater therapeutic potential for controlled inhibition of the pro - survival bcl - 2 members [ lessene et al. , 2008 ] .
figure 1 schematic illustration of the intracellular effects of bh3 mimetics .
bh3 mimetics disrupt the heterodimerization of the prosurvival ( e.g. bcl - 2 ) and pro - apoptotic ( e.g. bax ) bcl - 2 members located at different intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria .
liberation of the proapoptotic proteins leads to ( 1 ) the formation of momp ( mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization ) followed by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria , ( 2 ) as well as the release of ca2 + from the intracellular stores .
bh3 mimetics the first bh3 mimetic obtained by molecular modeling and computer screening , ha14 - 1 , was able to displace bax from bcl - 2 and induce apoptosis in vitro , characterized by loss of mitochondrial potential and activation of caspases [ wang et al. , 2000 ] .
soon after , two structurally unrelated groups of bh3 inhibitors ( bh3is ) , derived from bh3i - 1 and bh3i - 2 , were discovered in a fluorescence polarization - based screening [ degterev et al. , 2001 ] .
bh3is were found to displace bak peptide from bcl - xl and induce apoptosis characterized by cytochrome c release and caspase activation [ degterev et al. , 2001 ] .
in the meantime , the anticancer effects of gossypol isolated from the cotton plant ( gossypium ) have been attributed to inhibition of bcl - 2 , bcl - xl , and mcl - 1 [ kitada et al. , 2003 ] .
in 2005 , abt - 737 was developed [ oltersdorf et al. , 2005 ] .
this small - molecule inhibitor of bcl - 2 , bcl - xl , and bcl - w , was two - three orders of magnitude more potent than the previous bh3 mimetics .
it did not induce apoptosis on its own , but rather sensitized cells to cell death signals , demonstrating efficacy with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation [ oltersdorf et al. , 2005 ] .
the oral bioavailability of this agent was improved even further , resulting in abt - 263 ( navitoclax ) , a bad - like bh3 mimetic , capable of triggering bax translocation , cytochrome c release , and subsequent apoptosis [ tse et al. , 2008 ] .
however , both abt - 737 and abt - 263 were found to induce thrombocytopenia and transient thrombocytopathy that severely hindered their therapeutic use [ schoenwaelder et al. , 2011 ] .
recently , navitoclax was re - engineered to create a potent , orally bioavailable inhibitor selective for bcl - 2 , abt - 199 ( venetoclax ) [ souers et al. , 2013 ] , which has become the first clinically approved small molecule targeting a protein - protein interaction for treating cll ( chronic lymphocytic leukemia ) [ green , 2016 ] .
on - going clinical trials using bh3 mimetics are listed in table 1 .
calcium signaling ca2 + signaling is one of the most important types of intracellular communication implicated in a wide variety of biological processes , including cell proliferation [ borowiec et al. , 2014 ] , migration [ wei et al. , 2012 ] , adhesion [ sheng et al. , 2013 ] , fertilization [ armant , 2015 ] , muscle contraction [ bers , 2002 ] , neuronal physiology and signal transmission [ brini et al. , 2014 ] , exocytosis [ petersen , 1992 ] and cell death [ criddle et al. , 2007 ] .
therefore , it is not at all surprising that in the past two decades substantial evidence has accumulated for the role of bcl - 2 proteins in the regulation of multiple aspects of the intracellular ca2 + homeostasis [ vervliet et al. , 2016 ] .
these proteins have been found not only at the mitochondrial membranes , but are also present in the cytosol , at the nuclear envelope as well as at the er , the main intracellular ca2 + store [ akao et al. , 1994 ] .
they directly interact with ca2 + channels and pumps affecting ca2 + release and the steady state er ca2 + levels .
for example , depending on the site of interaction , bcl - 2 can act either as a direct inhibitor or sensitizer of endoplasmic ip3rs ( inositol triphosphate receptors ) [ rong et al. , 2009 ; monaco et al. , 2012 ] .
the sensitizing effect is also shared by bcl - xl and mcl - 1 [ white et al. , 2005 ; eckenrode et al. , 2010 ] .
further , bcl - 2 and bcl - xl can directly bind to ryrs ( ryanodine receptors ) and inhibit ryr - mediated ca2 + release from the er [ vervliet et al. , 2014 ; vervliet et al. , 2015 ] .
bcl - 2 may either protect the function of serca ( sarco / endoplasmic reticulum ca2 + - atpase ) [ he et al. , 1997 ] , or destabilize it [ dremina et al. , 2006 ] .
at the mitochondrial membranes , bcl - 2 and bcl - xl have been demonstrated to directly inhibit mitochondrial ca2 + uptake via vdac1 ( voltage - dependent anion channel 1 ) , a large conductance channel permeable to ions and metabolites [ arbel and shoshan - barmatz , 2010 ; arbel et al. , 2012 ] ; whereas mcl - 1 was shown to have the opposite effect [ h. huang et al. , 2014 ] .
bcl - 2 may also inhibit mitochondrial ncx ( na +/ ca2 + exchanger ) , increasing ca2 + retention in this organelle [ zhu et al. , 2001 ] .
finally , bcl - 2 can suppress pmca ( plasma membrane ca2 + - atpase ) - mediated ca2 + extrusion with important implications for cell fate [ ferdek et al. , 2012 ] .
bh3 mimetics and calcium given the above , it might be expected that pharmacological inhibition of the pro - survival bcl - 2 proteins by bh3 mimetics could , in principle , affect the intracellular ca2 + homeostasis .
indeed , the research has demonstrated that the early mimetics , ha14 - 1 and bh3i - 2 ' , caused a slow and complete release of ca2 + from the er , followed by a sustained elevation of cytosolic ca2 + concentration in pancreatic acinar cells [ gerasimenko et al. , 2010 ] .
although this effect might be beneficial in cancer , in healthy cells ca2 + overload is undesirable as it promotes cell death , particularly necrosis [ criddle et al. , 2007 ] .
this ca2 + release was shown to be attenuated , but not completely blocked , by inhibition of ip3rs and ryrs as well as substantially reduced by strong intracellular ca2 + buffering .
importantly , inhibition of ip3rs and ryrs dramatically reduced bh3i - 2 ' - elicited apoptosis , indicating that ca2 + release from the er contributed to cell death induction by this bh3 mimetic [ gerasimenko et al. , 2010 ] .
similar effects of ca2 + deregulation by ha14 - 1 were also demonstrated in platelets , hela and hek - 293t cells [ akl et al. , 2013 ] .
a recent study has shed new light on this phenomenon by showing that ca2 + responses induced in pancreatic acinar cells by ha14 - 1 , bh3i - 2 ' and gossypol were largely diminished in the absence of bax , but not bak or bcl - 2 [ ferdek et al. , 2017 ] , suggesting a regulatory role for bax in ca2 + release from the intracellular stores ( fig. 1 ). of note is that bh3 mimetics in this study caused not only apoptosis , but also substantial levels of necrosis in pancreatic acinar cells , both of which were inhibited by strong ca2 + buffering , again pointing towards a ca2 + - dependent component in the mechanism of bh3 mimetic - induced killing .
since global and sustained ca2 + signals are associated with induction of necrosis , fine tuning of these signals could be useful in shifting unfavorable necrosis towards more physiological apoptosis and thus limiting the side effects of a bh3 mimetic therapy .
this has been achieved by calps ( ca2 + - like peptides ) , which , by binding to the ef - hand motifs , mimic the effects of ca2 + , pre - activating various ca2 + - sensitive intracellular targets such as calmodulin and ca2 + channels and pumps [ villain et al. , 2000 ] .
calps partially reduced ca2 + responses induced by bh3 mimetics resulting in necrosis inhibition or a significant shift in cell death towards apoptosis [ ferdek et al. , 2017 ] .
this demonstrates that even a nonspecific inhibition of intracellular ca2 + fluxes can attenuate pathophysiological ca2 + responses and influence the cell death mode and thus may improve the outcome of anticancer therapies .
it is worth noting that not all bh3 mimetics can affect ca2 + homeostasis .
a few studies were unable to demonstrate any significant ca2 + release induced by abt - 737 in platelets and cell lines [ schoenwaelder & jackson , 2012 ; akl et al. , 2013 ] or by abt - 199 in various in vitro models [ vervloessem et al. , 2017 ] .
it remains unclear why some bh3 mimetics trigger ca2 + release from the intracellular stores , whereas others do not share this effect .
given the strong dependence of ca2 + responses on the presence of bax , it is rather unlikely that off - target effects of early bh3 mimetics are entirely responsible for this phenomenon .
conclusion in conclusion , extensive research on inhibitors of the prosurvival bcl - 2 members yielded a new class of anticancer agents , showing promise particularly against leukemia and lymphoma .
initial excitement , however , slightly faded when the early compounds showed marked side effects .
some of these effects have been attributed to deregulated intracellular ca2 + homeostasis .
despite that , the efforts continued to tailor the specificity of bh3 mimetics in order to preserve the anticancer activity and reduce the undesirable effects .
this resulted in abt - 199 , the first clinically approved drug targeting a protein - protein interaction [ green , 2016 ] .
current clinical trials attempt to combine bh3 mimetics with existing chemotherapeutic agents ( table 1 ) .
nevertheless , it might become essential to establish whether any new bh3 mimetic deregulates intracellular ca2 + release in healthy cells .
what is more , in order to increase the safety and efficacy of bh3 mimetic drugs , simultaneous application of agents that regulate intracellular ca2 + homeostasis might be taken into consideration .

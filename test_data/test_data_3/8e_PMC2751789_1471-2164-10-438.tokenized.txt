background oceans cover more than 70 % of the earth 's surface and are critical for the homeostasis of the environment .
among the components of the ocean ecosystem , zooplankton play vital roles in energy and matter transfer through the system .
despite their importance , understanding of zooplankton biodiversity is limited because of their fragile nature , small body size , and the large number of species from various taxonomic phyla .
here we present the results of single - gene zooplankton community analysis using a method that determines a large number of mitochondrial coi gene sequences from a bulk zooplankton sample .
this approach will enable us to estimate the species richness of almost the entire zooplankton community .
results a sample was collected from a depth of 721 m to the surface in the western equatorial pacific off pohnpei island , micronesia , with a plankton net equipped with a 2 - m2 mouth opening .
a total of 1,336 mitochondrial coi gene sequences were determined from the cdna library made from the sample. from the determined sequences , the occurrence of 189 species of zooplankton was estimated .
blastn search results showed high degrees of similarity (> 98 %) between the query and database for 10 species , including holozooplankton and merozooplankton .
conclusion in conjunction with the census of marine zooplankton and barcode of life projects , single - gene zooplankton community analysis will be a powerful tool for estimating the species richness of zooplankton communities .
background the fauna of the world 's oceans is dominated in terms of abundance and biomass by drifting organisms collectively referred to as plankton .
plankton occur in all marine waters , throughout all depths , and , for many species , across widespread biogeographical regions .
zooplankton ( planktonic animals ) support many major fisheries and mediate fluxes of nutrients and chemical elements essential to life on earth .
despite more than a century of sampling the oceans , a comprehensive understanding of zooplankton biodiversity has eluded oceanographers because of the fragile nature and small body size of these organisms , as well as the large number of species from various taxonomic phyla [ 1,2 ] .
for many zooplankton groups , there are longstanding and unresolved questions of species identification , systematic relationships , genetic diversity , and biogeography .
in light of this , we are working toward a taxonomically comprehensive assessment of zooplankton biodiversity throughout the world 's oceans through the international project census of marine zooplankton [ 3 ] .
results and discussion a zooplankton sample was collected off pohnpei island , micronesia ( 6degrees16'n , 162degrees09'e ) .
a cdna mitochondrial coi ( cytochrome c oxidase subunit i ) gene library was constructed from the sample , and 1,336 inserts containing the mitochondrial coi gene were randomly sequenced [ ddbj : ab332438 - ab333773 ] .
a cdna rather than a gdna library was constructed to remove pseudogene sequences from the analysis [ 4 ] .
the mismatch distribution of these 1,336 sequences revealed a high frequency of very small (< 0.03 ) genetic distance sequence pairs ( figure 1 ) .
these sequence pairs with very small genetic distances were assumed to have originated from the same species ( discussed below ) .
a second peak was observed around a distance of about 0.14 ( from 0.13 to 0.16 ) , and most of these counts were comparisons between two phylogroups in the copepoda clade ( figure 2 , clades 1 and 2 ) .
the frequencies between these peaks were very low .
the minimum frequency ( 106 counts ) was observed in the range between 0.12 and 0.13 .
based on this observation , we set the criterion that if the genetic distance of two sequences was greater than 0.12 , the sequences were derived from different species .
if the genetic distance of two sequences was less than 0.12 , then we considered the sequences to be derived from the same species .
the genetic distances of the mitochondrial coi gene sequence have been reported from various animal taxa ( mainly vertebrata and arthropoda ) , and the general ranges for the intra - and interspecies distances are 0.0001 - 0.05 and 0.04 - 0.21 , respectively ( kimura two - parameter model ) [ 5 ] .
although it is not a conclusive value for animal species definition , we have tentatively taken a genetic distance of 0.12 as the boundary between intra - and interspecies distances in this study , and this value was in the range of interspecific genetic distance reported previously [ 5 ] .
the rarefaction curve was estimated using the criterion of a genetic distance of 0.12 ( figure 3 ) using dotur [ 6 ] .
although the number of observed otus is still growing in 1,300 sequenced colonies , the rate of increase of the curve decreased gradually after around 100 sequenced colonies .
figure 4 shows the relationships between species richness estimated by chao1 , rarefaction , and percentage of sequence differences used for the estimation .
the figure shows gradual changes of chao1 and rarefaction around sequence differences of 0.12 .
as the distance of 0.12 is not a conclusive value for species definition , caution is required in the further use of this value .

we conducted blastn searches against the genbank non - redundant database using as queries all sequences derived from the analysis .
among the sequences , those that fulfilled the criteria ( blast score and similarity greater than 100 and 83 % , respectively ) were assigned to 11 taxonomic groups ( figure 2 ) .
several of the assigned sequences showed very high degrees of nucleotide similarity to known species , including copepoda ( candacia longimana , cosmocalanus darwinii , neocalanus robustior , rhincalanus rostrifrons ) , euphausiacea ( stylocheiron carinatum ) , mollusca ( clio pyramidata , sthenoteuthis oualaniensis , strombus mutabilis , strombus wilsoni ) , and vertebrata ( coryphaena hippurus ; table 1 ) .
the very high degrees of similarity indicated that these species were actually collected in our sampling .
among them , one vertebrate species , coryphaena hippurus , and two benthic gastropod species , strombus mutabilis and strombus wilsoni , were sampled as non - holozooplanktonic animals in the dispersal life history phase as pelagic larvae .
these observations indicated that application of this analysis enables the estimation of larval dispersal , which is difficult to achieve based on morphological observations .

overall , each taxonomic group formed a single cluster including gastropoda , chaetognatha , euphausiacea , decapoda , vertebrata , copepoda , and cephalopoda .
there were also two cases in which the taxonomic assignment did not work well .
the first was the occurrence of hexapoda in various clusters , which rarely occurs in the ocean environment , except pleustonic insects of the genus halobates .
the second was the difficulty of assignment of taxonomic groups due to low blast scores and similarities ( coloured grey in figure 2 ) .
the most plausible reason for these ambiguities is the paucity of mitochondrial coi sequences for some taxa in the dna database .
in general , the mitochondrial coi gene sequences in the dna database are biased among taxa , and this bias was assumed to be the main reason for the occurrence of hexapoda in our analysis .
the most efficient solution for these problems will be the expansion of zooplankton dna barcode , and it is hoped that the progress of the barcode of life project [ 7 ] in collaboration with the census of marine zooplankton will fill these gaps .
to our knowledge , the discovery sond cruise [ 8 ] is the only other attempt to date to estimate the species richness of a whole zooplankton community collected at a single site .
in this series of studies [ 9 - 19 ] , a total of 618 species of zooplankton were identified and counted in samples collected around the canary islands ( table 2 ) .
the extrapolated species richness ( chao1 [ 20 ]) of the present study was estimated as 188.90 ( 95 % confidence interval , 156.79 - 255.60 ) using dotur [ 6 ] .
our results cannot be directly compared with the sond cruise data because of differences in sampling effort between the two studies .
in the sond cruise , two primary types of sampling equipment were used : isaacs - kidd midwater trawl and n113h .
table 2 comparison of species that occurred in the present study and the sond cruise taxa present study (%) sond cruise (%) amphipoda 106 ( 17.2 ) cephalopoda 4 ( 2.1 ) 18 ( 2.9 ) copepoda 81 ( 42.2 ) 220 ( 35.6 ) decapoda 35 ( 5.6 ) euphausiacea 28 ( 4.5 ) gastropoda 8 ( 4.2 ) ostracoda 35 ( 5.7 ) siphonophora 64 ( 10.4 ) vertebrata 11 ( 5.7 ) 112 ( 18.1 ) total 192.47 618 furthermore , about 76 vertically stratified zooplankton samples that were collected above 1,000 m were combined to estimate the occurrence of species [ 19 ] .
in contrast , the present study was conducted based on a single sample collected from a depth of 721 m to the surface .
these sampling effort differences may have accounted for the differences in species richness between the sond cruise and the present study .
in addition , the lower species richness in the present study may have been due to our experimental design .
in the present study , after construction of the cdna library from mrna , the mitochondrial coi genes were amplified with " universal ( lco1490 [ 21 ])" and polyt primers .
it is possible that some of the mitochondrial coi gene sequences may not have been amplified due to primer mismatch for some species .
although the single - gene zooplankton community analysis approach is an efficient means of collecting sequence information , given technical difficulties due to primer mismatch , further studies and the development of novel methodologies are required to gain a complete understanding of zooplankton diversity .
conclusion although the estimation of species richness and composition of the community are among the most important aspects of single - gene zooplankton community analysis , these sequence data will be further utilised by construction of a dedicated database .
we expect that the accumulation of additional marine animal mitochondrial coi gene sequence data in the barcode project will aid in further clarifying sequences from unknown species .
furthermore , this process of sequence assignment to particular species through database analysis indicated the occurrence of these species in the sampling site for the present study .
we have now constructed a publicly accessible zooplankton community analysis database that can be searched using blastn [ 22 ]. with regard to the future of zooplankton community genetic analysis , adoption of next - generation sequencing technology should enable researchers to read libraries sufficiently to estimate species richness without extrapolation [ 23,24 ] .
we are currently expanding our sampling effort to all oceans to further understand zooplankton biodiversity .
methods zooplankton sampling the sample was collected off pohnpei island , micronesia ( 6degrees16'n , 162degrees09'e ) .
collection was performed with a plankton net ( ori net [ 25 ]) with a 2 - m2 mouth opening and 0.69 - mm mesh aperture .
after removal of large animals ( more than about 4 cm at their largest measurement ) , the sample was split into two fractions : one was preserved in ethanol for barcode analysis and the other was homogenised with trizol ( invitrogen ) and kept at - 80degreesc .
a total wet volume of about 30 ml zooplankton was collected and homogenised with 270 ml trizol in this step .
total rna extraction and mrna purification in the laboratory , total rna was extracted from the sample following the trizol protocol , followed by mrna purification using poly ( a ) purist mag ( ambion ) .
a total of 9.6 ml total rna ( aqueous phase ) was further purified for mrna in this step .
mitochondrial coi gene library construction and sequence analysis the purified mrna was used as the template for creator smart cdna library construction kit ( bd biosciences ) .
using this constructed cdna library , we amplified mitochondrial coi genes using coi universal ( lco1490 ) [ 21 ] and polyt primers with restriction sites that were further used to construct a mitochondrial coi gene library with the same kit .
we then randomly analysed colonies obtained on agar plates .
blastn search and taxonomic assignment the lengths of all obtained sequences were adjusted to 500 base pairs , and a blastn [ 26 ] search against the ncbi non - redundant dataset with default settings was performed with all sequences as queries .
those sequences that did not show any similarity to the mitochondrial coi gene sequences were removed ( the search was performed in november 2006 ) .
blastn search against the ncbi non - redundant dataset was also used to infer species or higher taxonomic groups of mitochondrial coi gene sequences determined in the present study .
in the blastn result list , the species with the highest score was assigned to each sequence with the following criteria .
if the blastn score was 100 or more and blastn similarity was 98 % or more , the name of the resulted species was assigned to the sequence and listed in table 1 .
if the blastn score was 100 or more and blastn similarity was 83 - 98 % , the name of higher taxon group to which the resulted species belongs was assigned to the sequence and is shown in the figure 2 .
if blastn scores and similarity values did not reach these values of criteria , ' unknown ' was assigned to the sequences and are colored gray in the figure 2 .
removal of pcr recombination , mismatch distribution analysis , rarefaction curve analysis , phylogenetic analysis to remove sequences produced by pcr recombination , we manually applied a partial treeing approach [ 27 ] to the aligned dataset ; although some programs and servers are available for related analysis , none worked appropriately for our analysis .
briefly , after the sequence alignment was adjusted using clustalx [ 28 ] , square distance matrixes of both the left 100 and right 100 base pairs of the aligned sequence were constructed in mega3.1 [ 29 ] .
then total absolute deviations of each sequence in these matrixes were calculated .
as a result , we deleted one sequence that showed a very large deviation from the others .
we assumed this was not the only chimera sequence that occurred in the analysis , but it was not possible to eliminate all pcr recombination sequences because of ambiguity .
after removing the pcr recombination sequences from the analysis , we again adjusted alignment of the remaining 1,336 sequences using clustalx .
an unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour - joining method with nucleotide p - distances ( alignment gaps were completely deleted ) implemented in paup * 4.10b [ 30 ] .
the reliability of each tree node was assessed using the bootstrap method with 1,000 replicates .
the mismatch distribution was estimated from the distance matrix .
the distance matrix was also calculated using phylip3.66 [ 31 ] , and the matrix was further used for rarefaction curve and chao1 calculation using dotur [ 6 ] .

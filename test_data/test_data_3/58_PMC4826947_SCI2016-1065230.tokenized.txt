hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer death in patients .
several studies demonstrated that hepatic cancer stem cells ( hcscs ) , also called tumor - initiating cells , are involved in regulation of hcc initiation , tumor progression , metastasis development , and drug resistance .
despite the extensive research , the underlying mechanisms by which hcscs are regulated remain still unclear .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are able to regulate a lot of biological processes such as self - renewal and pluripotency of hcscs , representing a new promising strategy for treatment of hcc chemotherapy - resistant tumors .
in this review , we synthesize the latest findings on therapeutic regulation of hcscs by mirnas , in order to highlight the perspective of novel mirna - based anticancer therapies for hcc treatment .
1. introduction hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is the fifth most common cancer in the world and in most cases it develops in patients with chronic liver diseases such as viral infections and cirrhosis .
treatment for primary liver cancer depends on the location and stage of the cancer and liver 's functionality ; however , in many cases hcc is diagnosed in patients with an advanced stage .
thus , it is difficult to treat patients at surgical and pharmacological levels [ 1 ] .
treatment options include surgical resection , thermal ablation , systemic chemotherapy , transarterial chemoembolization , and selective internal radiation therapy with poor prognosis in all approaches due to the high recurrence rate and to the tumor chemoresistance .
the emerging cancer stem cell ( csc ) theory based on targeting of cscs [ 2 ] suggests new alternative therapeutic approaches to treat various types of tumors that could overcome defeats of the traditional therapy .
thanks to the identification of the major signaling pathways , transcriptional factors , surface markers , microrna ( mirnas ) , and other factors that confer stem - like properties to cscs , various therapeutic implications have been developed until now .
hepatic cancer stem cells ( hcscs ) represent a subpopulation of cells positive for different markers including cd133 , cd90 , and epcam [ 3 ] .
these cells are responsible of the tumor initiation and progression and are also involved in the metastasis processes and chemoresistance .
thanks to the hcscs characterization , it is possible to study the impact of any molecular mediators highly expressed in hcscs during carcinogenesis , through the identification of specific stemness markers .
the major stem - maintenance pathways involved in hcscs regulation are tgf - beta family , wnt / beta - catenin axis , pi3k / akt / mtor , and epcam .
it is of note that these signaling pathways are subjected to different homeostasis system and in particular are regulated epigenetically by mirnas .
mirnas , by acting as oncogenes or oncosuppressors , are able to regulate many biological processes such as self - renewal and pluripotency of hcscs [ 4 , 5 ] , representing a new promising strategy for treatment of chemotherapy - resistant hcc tumors .
in this review , we summarized the latest findings on the therapeutic regulation of hcscs induced by mirna and we try to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in order to highlight the perspective of novel mirna - based anticancer therapies for hcc treatment .
2. hepatic cancer stem cells : biogenesis and functions cancer stem cells ( cscs ) or tumor - initiating cells ( t - ics ) are tumor cells discovered in solid and hematological tumors .
these cells share stem - like properties and are involved in the tumorigenesis , in development of metastases , and in self - renewal processes .
bonnet and dick described cscs for the first time , in acute myeloid leukemia [ 6 ] .
several studies showed their existence in other different types of cancer such as glioma [ 7 ] , breast [ 8 ] , colon [ 9 ] , ovarian [ 10 , 11 ] , pancreatic [ 12 ] , prostate [ 13 , 14 ] , lung [ 15 ] , liver [ 16 ] , and stomach [ 17 ] cancer .
it has been demonstrated that cscs play important roles in the tumor initiation and maintenance but also in metastasis and cancer relapse induced by the chemoresistance to the conventional therapies [ 2 ] .
cscs can be originated by different processes ranging from the transformation of normal stem cells or progenitor cells through multiple gene mutations [ 18 ] or by adult progenitor cells and progressive acquisition of stem cell properties through reversal of ontogeny [ 19 ] as the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) process .
emt is a biologic process that induces the transformation of a polarized epithelial cell into a mesenchymal cell type with stem - like properties [ 20 ] .
in addition , it can also confer to the cscs the ability to generate metastasis , which is uncommon in other cancer cell types .
emt together with reverse transition from mesenchymal to an epithelial phenotype ( met ) are involved in embryonic development , which leads to the disruption of epithelial cell homeostasis and the acquisition of a migratory mesenchymal phenotype [ 21 ] .
the emt process is controlled by the canonical pathways such as wnt and transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) [ 22 ] .
these observations suggest a new concept of migration process based on the existence of two forms of cancer stem cells : ( 1 ) stationary cancer stem cells ( scs ) and ( 2 ) mobile cancer stem cells ( mcs ) .
scss are involved in tumor initiation and are detectable in the differentiated central area of tumor , while mcss are known as cells derived from scss through the acquisition of emt .
hepatic cscs ( hcscs ) have been isolated from heterogeneous tumor tissues , based on the specific surface markers and functional properties .
it is of note that various markers have been identified for hepatic cancer stem cells , including cd133 , cd90 , and epcam [ 3 ] .
the principal hcscs molecular markers are summarized in table 1 .
3. signaling pathways involved in the regulation of hcscs hcscs show specific features of pluripotency and self - renewal ; this phenotype is strictly regulated by different types of molecular effectors involved in many pathways .
here , we review the latest findings on the most important mediators involved in hcscs regulation .
3.1 .
tgf - beta tgf - beta is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in embryonic development and adult homeostasis maintenance .
it regulates the progression of many human diseases as embryo - defects , autoimmune illness , and cancer progression [ 57 - 59 ] .
it has been also demonstrated that tgf - beta regulates hcscs cell proliferation and differentiation .
its deregulation induces aberrant expression of il - 6 resulting in changed differentiation pattern and tumorigenesis [ 60 ] .
tgf - beta binds to the heterodimeric surface receptor tbetari / tbetarii .
subsequently , the subunit tbetar is activated by the phosphorylation of the c - term motif ser - x - ser of r - smads or smad2 / 3 .
the result is the formation of oligomeric smad complex ( together with co - smad and smad4 ) that is then accumulated in the nucleus and regulates gene expression [ 61 , 62 ] .
other studies showed the interaction between tgf - beta and other cell effectors signal transducer such as mapks , erk , jnk and p38 , pi3k / akt axis , rhoa gtpase , and pak2 [ 63 , 64 ] .
interesting data showed that smad7 highly expressed in hepatocarcinoma and other types of cancer disease [ 65 ] negatively regulates tgf - beta through tbetari subunit [ 66 , 67 ] or by interference with the r - smad - smad4 - dna complex formation [ 68 ] .
tgf - beta signaling also induces endothelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in neoplastic cells .
emerging evidences indicate that smad7 also regulates wnt / beta - catenin , nf - kappab , interleukin - 1 / toll - like receptor , and egf / mapk signaling pathways [ 65 , 66 ] .
recently it has been demonstrated that hccs with impaired levels of transcription - 3 / oct4 have dysfunctional tgf - beta signaling and share similar properties of cancer progenitor cells [ 67 ] .
3.2 .
wnt / beta - catenin one of the most recurrent pathways involved in hcscs regulation is the wnt / beta - catenin signaling .
this signaling regulates development , growth , survival , regeneration , and self - renewal processes in hcc [ 68 ] .
beta - catenin acts as a pivotal mediator in wnt / beta - catenin signaling pathway through the interaction between frizzled , the receptor of wnt , and coreceptor lipoprotein receptor related 5 / 6 ( lrp5 / 6 ) .
this event results in the activation of disheveled ( dvl ) , in the dissociation of tetrameric beta - catenin / axin / gsk3beta / apc complex , in the reduction of beta - catenin phosphorylation , and in the migration of active beta - catenin to the nucleus ( figure 1 ) .
it has been showed that cytoplastmatic and nuclear accumulation of beta - catenin were founded in 20 - 40 % of hcc patients , although its target genes were unaffected .
nuclear beta - catenin interacts with t - cell factor ( tcf )/ lymphocyte enhancer factor 1 ( lef1 ) and some other coactivator as bcl9 , pygo , or creb - bp to regulate gene transcription of specific sequences [ 69 , 70 ] .
the prominent targets of this signaling are cd44 [ 71 ] , cyclin d1 [ 72 ] , and c - myc [ 73 ] .
c - myc is considered the preferred target of epcam , an adhesion transmembrane glycoprotein , identified as a good marker of hcscs [ 74 ] but also a prognosis biomarker , due to its correlation with more aggressive diseases [ 75 , 76 ] .
these data suggest that wnt signaling is involved in hcscs maintenance .
3.3 .
epcam the epcam signaling starts with a sequential cleavage of the surface protein , operated by tnf - alpha converting enzyme ( tace / adam17 ) and a gamma - secretase complex containing presenilin - 2 ( ps - 2 ) ( figure 1 ) .
it results in the separation of the extracellular domain , epex , and the cytoplasm releasing of epicd domain that becomes part of multiprotein complex composed of beta - catenin and lef ( both components present in wnt / beta - catenin signaling ) .
a key role in epcam pathway is played by fhl2 that first regulates the localization of the cleavage and then acts as a link between epicd and specific dna sequences [ 77 ] .
some transcriptional factors involved in pluripotent stem cells maintenance , as nanog , klf , sox2 , and oct4 , have been described as direct target of epcam in human embryonic stem cells [ 78 ] .
it has been demonstrated that epcam is a wnt - beta - catenin signaling target gene and may be used to facilitate hcc prognosis [ 79 ] .
3.4 .
pi3k / akt / mtor the pi3k / akt / mtor signaling that has been found to be deregulated in 40 - 50 % of hcc cases , with less differentiated tumors and with reduction of free disease survival [ 80 ] .
specifically , the activation of irs1 , an intracellular mediator of insulin signaling , induces the activation of pi3k ( phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ) .
this leads to the phosphorylation of pkb ( protein kinase b )/ akt mediated by pdk1 ( pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 ) , a positive regulator of the tuberous sclerosis ( tsc1 - tsc2 ) complex ; the latter promotes the activation of mtorc1 , a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 , through the small gtpase rheb ( ras homolog enriched in brain ) .
mtorc1 can target and activate s6k1 ( ribosomal protein s6 kinase ) and 4e - bp1 ( eukaryotic initiation factor 4e binding protein 1 ) , major regulators of protein translation .
the phosphatase pten ( phosphatase and tensin homolog ) physiologically inhibits the downstream activity of pi3k / akt axis and is frequently deregulated in hcc ( 66 % of tumor incidence in pten - deficient mice ) [ 81 ] ; moreover , it is correlated with poor prognosis and more frequent metastasis [ 82 ] .
3.5 .
hedgehog hedgehog pathway plays an important role during embryonic development and in cell fate maintenance .
it is activated by binding of ligands ( desert , indian , and sonic hedgehog ) to the membrane based patched ( ptc ) receptors [ 83 , 84 ] ( figure 1 ) .
recent reports established the role of hedgehog signaling in hcc [ 85 - 87 ] .
figure 1 shows a summarized view of pathways involved in regulation of hcscs .
4. therapeutic targets of mirna in hepatic cancer stem cells recent studies showed the role of mirna in many biological processes , including the regulation of carcinogenesis , sharing both oncogenes and oncosuppressor functions [ 36 , 54 , 88 - 90 ] .
the deregulation of mirna expression levels represents an important feature of tumor cells , resulting into an aberrant epigenetic regulation .
regarding liver tumor progression , mirnas act as tumor suppressors ( mir - 122 , mir26 , and mir - 223 ) or as oncogenic mirnas ( mir - 130b , mir - 221 , and mir - 222 ) .
emerging evidences suggest that mirnas play a key role also in the maintenance , progression , chemoresistance , and disease relapse of hcscs [ 4 , 5 ] .
for these reasons , many authors have identified in some mechanisms of " loss of stemness ," regulated by mirnas expression , novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [ 91 ] .
here , we summarized the latest findings on the therapeutic targets of mirna in hcscs .
4.1 .
oncogenic mirna in hcscs recently it has been demonstrated that mir - 10b represents a switch factor between liver normal stem cells ( lnscs ) and liver cancer stem cells ( lcscs ) .
this malignant transformation is mediated by the enhanced expression of the axis mir - 10b / hox transcript antisense rna ( hotair ) that induces the degradation of e - cadherin pattern in lnscs , thus facilitating the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) [ 34 ] .
in this way also mir - 21 , when silenced , induces an attenuate mrna expression of pten , reck , or pdcd4 , leading to a reduction in hcscs migration and invasion [ 35 ] .
the factors regulated by mir - 21 represent also a target of mir - 216a and mir - 217 that are able to bind specifically pten and smad7 .
this leads to the activation of tgf - beta1 / pi3k / akt signaling and to development of drug resistance to sorafenib in hcc [ 53 ] .
it has been showed that also mir - 142 - 3p acts as an oncogenic via cd 133 , conferring hcsc - like characteristic [ 39 ] .
several studies demonstrated that mir - 155 acts as oncogenic mirna , through the interaction with the axis tgf - beta1 / tp53inp1 .
this causes the emt and the acquisition of stem cell phenotype [ 46 , 92 ] .
4.2 .
mirna tumor suppressors in hcscs it is of note that mirnas are able to regulate several biological mechanisms .
for example , mir - 122 has a key role in glycolytic metabolism .
it induces a reversion of malignancy phenotype of hcscs , by regulation of glycolysis , which is more active in hcsc cd133 + , via inhibition of pdk4 and ldha [ 37 ] .
several studies showed that the oncosuppressor mir - 125b reduces emt , through smad2 / 4 protein association [ 38 ] .
this pathway seems to be influenced by the action of mir - 148a , whose expression levels are improved by glabridin ( gla ) in hepg2 , huh - 7 , and mhcc97h hepatic cancer cell lines .
mir - 125b inhibits tgf - beta / smad2 axis and leads to lack of hcsc - like properties [ 41 ] .
the isoform mir - 148b instead acts on neuropilin 1 ( nrp1 ) with same effects [ 42 ] .
in many studies , the interaction between some mirnas and transcriptional factors has been described , such as sox2 , oct4 , nanog , and c - myb , which play an important role in stemness maintenance [ 40 , 44 ] .
mir - 145 , for example , plays a critical role in hcscs tumor suppression , by reversing the effects of oct - 4 overexpression that normally leads to gain of tumorigenicity [ 40 ] .
conversely , mir - 150 interacts with 3'utr mrna sequence of c - myb , downregulating its expression levels ; in this case , it works as an oncosuppressor .
its presence is associated with a regression of hcscs potential , probably due to a decrement of cyclin d1 and bcl - 2 levels [ 44 ] .
a clinical study reported the dualistic effect of mir - 150 , also as an oncogene , together with mir - 155 and mir - 223 .
their suppression is due to a decrement of epcam + cell population [ 43 ] .
moreover , studies performed on mir - 200a demonstrated that it regulates stemness of hcscs with a dual activity .
overexpression of this mirna switches on the transition from lcsc to hcsc that it is observed through the expression analysis of n - cadherin , zeb2 , and vimentin [ 50 ] .
another study on regulatory role of mir - 200a showed that it acts as oncosuppressor in hepatic oval cells ( hocs ) , by direct interaction with wnt / beta - catenin axis .
functionally attenuation of mir - 200a leads to the activation of the pathway , resulting in tumorigenicity acquisition after hocs transition [ 49 ] .
beta - catenin represents also the molecular target of mir - 214 , which normally binds to the zeste homolog 2 ( ezh2 ) factor by increasing epcam + cells in hcc population .
the attenuation of mir - 214 or ezh2 overexpression leads to same results [ 52 ] .
mir - 612 regulates the emt through a direct interaction with akt2 [ 56 ] .
recent studies have highlighted the key role of mir - 181 in hcscs stemness maintenance through the interaction with let - 7 family members .
it has been demonstrated that let - 7 / mir - 181 axis is upregulated in hcscs , and this condition leads to chemoresistance to doxorubicin or sorafenib treatment [ 48 ] .
mir - 181 binds to some hepatic transcriptional regulators of differentiation as cdx2 and gata6 or nemo - like kinase ( nlk ) .
these interactions induce the pluripotent phenotype , observed through an increment of epcam + alpha - fetoprotein + hcscs [ 47 ] .
finally , recent studies reported the involvement of several mirnas in hcscs regulation / maintenance , through interaction with molecular target poorly studied .
mir - 152 , for example , shows an oncosuppressor role by targeting kit receptor [ 45 ] ; mir - 205 and mir - 491 , acting as oncosuppressors , interact , respectively , with plcbeta1 [ 51 ] and the git - 1 / nf - kappab axis [ 55 ] .
the regulatory functions of mirnas targeted in hcscs are summarized in table 2 .
5. therapeutic targets of mirna - based technology for treatment of hcc in order to eradicate the hcscs , several therapeutic approaches have been developed .
here we summarized the recent progress in hcscs research related to hcc , trying to provide a possible perspective for treatment of chemotherapy - resistant hcc tumors .
5.1 .
epigenetic therapy epigenetic mechanisms , such as histone modification and dna methylation , play several roles in cancer development and progression [ 93 ] .
several studies showed the efficacy of epigenetic agents as therapeutic approach in hcc [ 94 ] .
raggi and colleagues in experimental studies of epigenetic reprogramming showed that zebularine , a dna methyltransferase ( dnmt ) inhibitor , is able to influence csc properties such as self - renewal and tumorigenicity in hcscs [ 95 ] .
sall4 , a transcriptor factor , is able to regulate stemness of epcam - positive hepatocellular carcinoma , thus representing a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of hcc with stem cell features [ 96 ] .
altogether , these data suggest that epigenetic therapy may represent a promising approach for the eradication of csc in hcc .
5.2 .
antibody therapy several studies suggested that targeting cscs with monoclonal antibody could represent a strategy to improve the outcome of cancer therapy [ 97 ] .
regarding hcc , it has been proved that monoclonal antibodies have efficacy especially against cd13 , epcam , and cd133 , to eradicate the hcscs [ 27 , 98 , 99 ] .
clinical trials and preclinical experiments will be necessary to confirm the safety of antibody therapy .
5.3 .
molecular - target therapy molecular - target therapy is considered a promising therapeutic approach for hcc treatment .
it has been demonstrated that self - renewal of colorectal csc function is dependent on the bmi1 [ 100 ] .
other studies demonstrated that disruption of ezh2 impairs the tumor initiating , the self - renewal , and the cancer stem cells maintenance of various type tumors , including hcc [ 101 - 103 ] .
clinical trials would be needed to confirm if molecular - target therapy could be applied at clinical level , for hcscs elimination .
5.4 .
therapy targeting the hcscs niche another type of therapy developed for the eradication of hcscs is based on targeting the hcscs niches .
niches are identified , as specific microenvironments in which hcscs and normal tissue stem cells are present .
it has been demonstrated that sorafenib , the unique molecular - target drug approved to treat hcc at clinical level , may contribute to the eradication of hcscs by targeting raf / mek / erk pathway and receptor tyrosine kinases [ 104 , 105 ] .
clinical trials and preclinical experiments will be needed to confirm if therapy targeting the hcscs niche could be considered innovative for hcc treatment .
5.5 .
mirna in hcc treatment recent evidences have suggested the potential application of mirnas as novel strategy in cancer therapy for hcc .
it has been previously described that the therapeutic application of mirnas involves two different strategies [ 106 , 107 ] .
the first one inhibits oncogenic mirnas by mirna antagonists [ 108 ] .
the second one is represented by mirna replacement and is based on the reintroduction of a tumor suppressor mirna mimetic to restore a loss of function [ 109 ] .
one interesting study was performed in a mouse model of hcc by using mir - 26a using adenoassociated virus delivered systemically .
the authors demonstrated that ectopic expression of mir - 26a leads to induction of tumor - specific apoptosis and to inhibition of cancer cell proliferation [ 110 ] , indicating that delivery of mirnas may provide an important therapeutic strategy in hcc treatment .
however , its value in clinical trials still needs to be confirmed .
to date , very few trials investigating the role of cancer - targeted mirna in hcc have been performed .
for example , a phase i trial investigating the role of drug mrx34 , a liposome - based mir - 34 mimic , is currently undergoing [ 111 ] .
in order to assess the role of mirna based drugs in clinical practice and in hcc treatment , more trials are necessary [ 112 ] .
6. conclusions in this review , we synthesize the latest findings on therapeutic regulation of mirna by modulation of tumor - suppressive and oncogenic signaling pathways .
data emerging from these studies suggest that deregulation of mirna expression controls liver cancer progression and is responsible for the chemoresistance and disease relapse of hcscs , although the underlying mechanisms are not completely elucidated .
in order to highlight the perspective of novel mirna - based anticancer therapies for hcc treatment , more studies will be needed in the future .

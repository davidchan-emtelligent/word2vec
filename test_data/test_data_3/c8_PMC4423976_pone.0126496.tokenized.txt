introduction the aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of the combination of the preoperative platelet count and neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio ( cop - nlr ) for predicting postoperative survival of patients undergoing complete resection for non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) .
methods the preoperative cop - nlr was calculated on the basis of data obtained.patients with both an increased platelet count (> 30.0x104 mm - 3 ) and an elevated nlr (> 2.3 ) were assigned a score of 2 , and patients with one or neither were assigned as a score of 1 or 0 , respectively .
results a total of 1238 nsclc patients were enrolled in this analysis .
multivariate analysis using the 15 clinicolaboratory variables selected by univariate analyses demonstrated that the preoperative cop - nlr was an independent prognostic factor for dfs ( hr : 1.834 , 95 % ci : 1.536 to 2.200 , p < 0.001 ) and os ( hr : 1.810 , 95 % ci : 1.587 to 2.056 , p < 0.001 ) .
in sub - analyses by tumor stage ( i , ii , iiia ) , a significant association was found between dfs and os and level of cop - nlr in each subgroup ( p < 0.001 , p = 0.002 , p < 0.001 for dfs , respectively ; p < 0.001 , p = 0.001 , p < 0.001 for os ) .
when the subgroup of patients with high - risk cop - nlr ( score of 2 ) was analyzed , no benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy could be found ( p = 0.237 for dfs and p = 0.165 for os ) .
conclusions the preoperative cop - nlr is able to predict the prognosis of patients with nsclc and divide these patients into three independent groups before surgery .
our results also demonstrate that high - risk patients based on the cop - nlr do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy .
independent validation of our findings is warranted .

introduction lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer - related death worldwide , with 5 - year survival rates of less than 15 % [ 1 ] .
non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) accounts for approximately 80 % of all lung cancers .
recently , a large number of prognostic predictors have been reported in the literature for patients with nsclc , however , the majority of these factors cannot be obtained preoperatively .
moreover , some of these factors are available only as research tools .
recently , there has been a growing interest in the host inflammatory response to tumors , and systemic inflammatory response has been shown to reflect the promotion of angiogenesis , dna damage and tumor invasion through up - regulation of cytokines [ 2 - 4 ] .
based on this , a number of inflammation - based prognostic markers have been identified , such as the glasgow prognostic score ( gps ) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio ( plr ) [ 5 , 6 ] .
in addition , there is increasing evidence that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio ( nlr ) and thrombocytosis can be used for prognostication in lung cancer [ 7 - 10 ] .
recently , two studies investigated a novel inflammation - based prognostic system named the combination of platelet count and nlr ( cop - nlr ) .
they revealed that cop - nlr was a useful predictor of postoperative survival in patients with colorectal cancer and gastric cancer [ 11 , 12 ] .
however , to the best of our knowledge , no studies regarding cop - nlr in patients with nsclc are available .
therefore , in this study , we evaluated the clinical utility of a novel inflammation - based prognostic system ( cop - nlr ) in patients with nsclc undergoing complete resection .
patients and methods patients a retrospective study of patients withnsclc undergoing surgery was conducted at the tianjin medical university cancer institute and hospital from january 2005 to december 2009 .
the study was approved by the institutional review board of tianjin medical university cancer institute and hospital .
all patients provided written informed consent .
the inclusion criteria were ( 1 ) complete pulmonary resection and systematic node dissection of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and ( 2 ) histologically confirmed nsclc .
patients who met the following criteria were excluded from the study : ( 1 ) preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy ; ( 2 ) positive surgical margins ; ( 3 ) advanced disease ( e.g. , malignant pleural effusion / involvement or distant metastasis ) ; ( 4 ) clinical evidence of infection or other bone marrow , hematological or autoimmune disease ; ( 5 ) a history of lung cancer or a second primary cancer diagnosed within 5 years of the lung cancer index ; and ( 6 ) patients who died within 1 month after surgery .
based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria , a total of 1238 nsclc patients were analyzed in the present study .
all of the patients were chinese .
the preoperative evaluation included a detailed clinical history and physical examination with a series of biochemistry tests , complete blood cell counts and coagulation tests .
further investigations included radiography , flexible bronchoscopy , chest and upper abdominal computed tomography ( ct ) , radionuclide bone scan , and ct or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain .
tumor stages were based on the 7th edition of the tnm classification [ 13 ] .
the main adjuvant treatment that patients underwent after operation was chemotherapy or radiotherapy , either alone or in combination .
the chemotherapy was routine program for nsclc , including vinorelbine , paclitaxel , or gemcitabine plus carboplatin or cisplatin .
definition of cop - nlr and other variables venous blood sampling was taken in a week prior to surgery , and collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) containing tube .
nlr was defined as follows : nlr = percentage of neutrophils for whole white blood cells ( wbc )/ percentage of lymphocytes for whole wbc or nlr = peripheral neutrophil count / peripheral lymphocyte count .
the cut - off values of the preoperative platelet count and nlr were decided using receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve analyses .
for the 1238 nsclc patients in our study , an nlr of 2.3 corresponded to the maximum joint sensitivity and specificity on the roc plot .
the area under the curve ( auc ) for nlr was 0.650 .
thus , the recommended cut - off value for nlr was 2.3 .
similarly , the prominent point on the roc curve indicated a cut - off value of 29.0 x104 mm - 3 for the platelet count,and the area under the roc curve was 0.562 .
therefore , the recommended cut - off value of preoperative platelet count was defined as 30.0 x104 mm - 3 .
the cop - nlr was calculated on the basis of data obtained .
patients with both an increased platelet count (> 30x104 mm - 3 ) and an elevated nlr (> 2.3 ) were assigned a score of 2 , and patients with one or neither were assigned as a score of 1 or 0 , respectively .
statistical analysis all statistical analyses were carried out using spss 13.0 software ( spss inc. , chicago , usa ) .
overall survival ( os ) was defined as the interval between the date of surgery and the date of death or last follow - up. disease - free survival ( dfs ) was defined as the duration of time between the date of surgery and the date of first recurrence or last follow - up. data are presented as the mean +/ - s.d. the differences between the three cop - nlr groups and the clinicolaboratory variables were analyzed by chi - square test and kruskal - wallis test .
hazard ratios ( hr ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % ci ) were calculated by univariate and multivariate analysis using the cox proportional hazards model .
twenty - three clinicolaboratory variables , including age , sex , smoking status , resection type , histological subtype , tumor location , lesion , tnm stage , adjuvant chemotherapy , adjuvant radiotherapy , wbc count , platelet count , neutrophil ratio , lymphocyte ratio , monocyte ratio , nlr , albumin , intraoperative blood loss , hemoglobin ( hb ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) , fibrinogen , d - dimer , and cop - nlr were entered in the univariate analysis .
in order to classify the patients into two groups , the cut - off values of clinicolaboratory variables were determined using roc curve analyses .
the value of the maximum joint sensitivity and specificity on the roc plot was defined as the recommended cut - off value .
clinicolaboratory variables with a p - value < 0.05 were further analyzed in the multivariate analysis to determine the independent predictors of dfs and os. the kaplan - meier method and the log - rank test were used to compare the survival curves of the three cop - nlr groups .
results based on the inclusion and exclusion , ultimately , a total of 1238 patients with histologically confirmed nsclc were enrolled in this study .
there were 584 patients with cop - nlr = 0 , 488 patients with cop - nlr = 1 and 166 patients with cop - nlr = 2. of these , 426 ( 34.4 %) were women , and 812 ( 65.6 %) were men .
the median age was 60 years , with an age range from 24 to 82 years .
the distribution of pathological stages was as follows : stage i , 536 ; stage ii , 264 ; and stage iiia , 438 .
the follow - up period ranged from 2 month to 96 months ( median , 45.0 months ; mean , 44.1 months ) .
at the end of the last follow up , 686 patients had died .
the 5 - year os rate was 47.3 % for the whole study population .
the distribution of the clinical background characteristics of the studied patients in the three groups is shown in table 1 .
as shown in table 1 , significant differences between cop - nlr and age ( p = 0.002 ) , sex ( p < 0.001 ) , smoking status ( p = 0.004 ) , resection type ( p < 0.001 ) , histological subtype ( p < 0.001 ) , lesion ( p < 0.001 ) , and tnm stage ( i / ii / iiia ) ( p < 0.001 ) were demonstrated .

based on the cut - off value , we separated the patients into different groups .
survival analyses in relation to nlr and platelet count and patient prognosis were performed .
in the univariate analysis of os , nlr and platelet countwere both found to be significant factors , with hazard ratio ( hr ) = 1.533 ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] : 1.458 to 1.785 ) for nlr , and hr = 1.379 ( 95 % ci : 1.166 to 1.634 ) for platelet count .
to identify the optimal factor for patient prognosis , we evaluated the prognostic value of cop - nlr .
the hr for cop - nlr was 1.813 ( 95 % ci : 1.650 to 2.106 ) , implying a more important prognostic value .
for dfs , the hr for cop - nlr was 1.835 ( 95 % ci : 1.580 to 2.132 ) ( table 3 ) .
other identified prognostic factors for dfs and os included resection type , lesion , tnm stage , adjuvant radiotherapy , wbc count , neutrophil ratio , lymphocyte ratio , monocyte ratio , albumin , intraoperative blood loss , hb , ldh , fibrinogen , and d - dimer .

kaplan - meier analysis and log - rank test demonstrated that there were significant differences in dfs and os among the three cop - nlr groups ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) ( fig 1 ) .
patients with cop - nlr = 0 had better prognoses than those with cop - nlr = 1 or cop - nlr = 2 .
the 5 - year survival rate for cop - nlr = 0 , cop - nlr = 1 , and cop - nlr = 2 was 59.5 % , 40.2 % and 25.3 % , respectively .
thus , the preoperative cop - nlr was able to divide the patients into three independent groups .
similarly , cop - nlr could also separate the patients into three independent groups in sqcc or adenocarcinoma ( fig 2 ) .
when the analysis was stratified by stage ( i , ii , iiia ) , we found that dfs and os were better in the lower cop - nlr group than in the higher cop - nlr group in the stage i , ii , and iiia subgroups ( fig 3 ) .
furthermore , subgroup analyses also revealed that decreased preoperative cop - nlr was significantly associated with better clinical outcomes for patients regardless of whether the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy ( fig 4 ) .
to evaluate whether high - risk patients based on cop - nlr = 2 would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy compared with surgery alone , a kaplan - meier analysis and log - rank test were performed .
the results of this high - risk subgroup demonstrated no significance difference in dfs and os ( p = 0.237 and p = 0.165 , respectively ) ( fig 5 ) .

discussion immune response within the tumor microenvironment is a critical component of tumor progression and aggressiveness .
understanding these responses has allowed researchers to use immune factors to stratify the prognosis of patients with cancer .
previous studies found that several immune markers could predict the clinical outcome of patients with nsclc .
using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry , suzuki and colleagues found that tumor interleukin - 12 receptor beta2 ( il - 12rbeta2 ) , il - 7r , and stromal foxp3 / cd3 ratio are independent predictors of recurrence in patients with stage i lung adenocarcinoma [ 14 ] .
furthermore , in 1290 patients with nsclc , tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes ( mostly cd8 +) in the tumor correlated with a better os [ 15 ] .
other immune markers in the tumor microenvironment and peripheral blood of patients with nsclc have also been reported [ 16 ] .
in the present study , we investigated the prognostic value of a novel inflammation - based prognostic system , cop - nlr , in 1238 nsclc patients undergoing complete resection .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to show cop - nlr as an independent prognostic factor in patients with nsclc .
in our study , the prominent point on the roc curve indicated a cut - off value of 29.0 x104 mm - 3 for the platelet count .
although the normal high value for platelet count was 30.0x104 mm - 3 , the cut - off value for reactive thrombocytosis is not clearly defined .
thus , based on the roc curve , we set 30.0x104 mm - 3 as the cut - off value of the platelet count .
in physiology , platelets have been recognized as mediators of regulatory functions such as immunomodulation , wound healing and angiogenesis [ 17 ] .
serving as dynamic reservoirs of various factors , platelets can secrete cytokines and growth factors such as vegf , platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) , tgf - beta and fgf [ 18 - 20 ] , which in turn contribute to cancer progression,including angiogenesis , cell migration and proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition [ 21 ] .
vegf can promote tumor growth. by inducing the dimerization of egfr and pdgfr , pdgf results in egfr transactivation [ 22 ] .
platelet - derived tgf - beta activates the smad and nf - kb pathways and promotes cancer metastasis [ 23 ] .
cancer cells can also produce il - 6 , which has a cell - proliferative effect , triggering the differentiation of megakaryocytes to platelets in the bone marrow .
moreover , platelet receptors and ligands can mediate tumor cell - platelet binding to alter the biological behavior of the tumor [ 24 ] .
based on the above results , some studies have investigated the prognostic value of platelet counts in nsclc and found that platelet counts could predict prognosis [ 12 , 25 ] .
nlr , a measure of the relative difference of between neutrophil and lymphocyte counts , is one index of systemic inflammation .
inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of lung cancer [ 26 ] .
the host 's immune response to the cancer is lymphocyte dependent. with a relative lymphocytopenia , patients with a high nlr might have a poorer lymphocyte mediated immune response to cancer , thereby worsening their survival and increasing the potential for cancer progression .
similarly , patients with neutrophilia might have a poor survival .
vegf , a pro - angiogenic factor , the vast majority of which is secreted by neutrophils , plays an important role in cancer progression [ 27 ] .
the prognostic value of nlr in several types of cancer has been investigated [ 9 , 10 , 28 - 31 ] .
some studies used the cut - off value of 5.0 [ 10 , 28 ] , whereas other studies used different cut - off values [ 9 , 29 - 31 ] .
in our study , using roc curve analysis , we determined that the optimal cut - off value of nlr was 2.3 for predicting prognosis of patients with i - iiia nsclc after complete resection .
hence , both platelet counts and nlr might play an important role in cancer progression .
derived from platelet count and nlr , cop - nlr could expand the predictive value for prognosis of patients with cancer , essentially increasing the unfavorable effect of the platelet count and nlr in cancer progression .
therefore , it is reasonable that there were significant differences among the three cop - nlr groups in tumor - related finding such as age , sex , smoking status , resection type , histological type , and tnm stage .
similarly , it is reasonable that there were significant differences among the three cop - nlr groups in variables such as maximum tumor diameter , wbc count , platelet count , neutrophil ratio , lymphocyte ratio , monocyte ratio , hb , ldh , albumin , fibrinogen , d - dimer , nlr , and intraoperative blood loss .
low hb level and hypoalbuminemia are related to poor nutritional status , which reflect cachexia resulting from cancer progression .
cancer cells can release procoagulant molecules and proinflammatory cytokines to activate the coagulation system [ 32 ] .
as a final degradation product of crossed - link fibrin , d - dimer is a marker of the activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis [ 33 ] .
as a major acute - phase protein , elevated fibrinogen level is probably induced by an inflammatory response to cancer progression and a prothrombotic state in cancer paitents [ 34 ] .
some studies have reported that fibrinogen can be synthesized by cancer cells .
however , in our study , platelet count , nlr ( data not shown ) or cop - nlr was not associated with lymph node metastasis , reflecting the fact that cop - nlr is likely to contribute more to hematogenous metastasis than to lymph node metastasis in nsclc .
in the present study , univariate analysis identified twenty - three variables related to tumor or systemic inflammatory response .
ultimately , fifteen variables were entered in the multivariate analysis , and the results demonstrated that cop - nlr was associated with dfs and os , along with tnm stage , ldh level and d - dimer .
the kaplan - meier analysis and log - rank test demonstrated that the preoperative cop - nlr was able to divide the patients into three independent groups .
the result is comparable to that of previous studies [ 11 , 12 ] .
moreover , our study also showed that cop - nlr remained an independent marker in sqcc or adenocarcinoma .
when we compared the effect of the cop - nlr in patients with stage i , ii and iiia separately , we found a significant association between cop - nlr level and both dfs and os in stage i , ii and iiia .
at the same time , our results also demonstrated that higher cop - nlr was significantly associated with poor clinical outcome regardless of whether the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy .
furthermore , when the subgroup of patients with high - risk cop - nlr = 2 was analyzed , no benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy could be found .
over the last decade , numerous systemic inflammation - based prognostic predictors for patients with cancer have been identified .
among these useful and convenient predictors , the glasgow prognostic score ( gps ) is regarded as a prognostic milestone [ 5 ] , and it consists of two acute - phase protein markers , c - reactive protein ( crp ) and albumin .
some studies have investigated the prognostic value of gps in patients with various cancers [ 5 ] .
however , the clinical utility of gps might be limited because c - reactive protein is not routinely measured as part of the preoperative examination .
compared with gps , the preoperative cop - nlr might have a higher applicability for estimation of the systemic inflammation response because proliferation and differentiation of cellular components occurs much faster than protein synthesis when inflammatory cytokines are released .
patients undergoing nsclc complete resection all undergo preoperative full blood counts,and the platelet count and nlr can be calculated from the data that are already routinely available .
thus , there is no additional expenditure .
moreover , compared to serum tumor markers such as scc , tpsa , nse , ca19 - 9 , cea and cyfra21 - 1 , hematologic markers are much cheaper and faster .
in summary , based on the results of our study , the preoperative cop - nlr is able to predict the prognosis of patients with nsclc and divide these patients into three independent groups before surgery , and that high - risk patients base on the preoperative cop - nlr do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy .

meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin ( muo ) is a common , naturally - occurring , clinical disease of pet dogs .
it is an immune - mediated condition that has many similarities with experimental autoimmune encephalitis ( eae ) in rodents and so investigation of its pathogenesis may aid in understanding factors that contribute to development of multiple sclerosis in people .
gut microbiota are known to modulate immune responses that influence susceptibility to immune - mediated brain disease .
in this study we aimed to compare abundance of specific constituents of the fecal microbiota , namely faecalibacterium prausnitzii and prevotellaceae , between dogs diagnosed with muo and matched controls .
fecal samples were obtained from 20 dogs diagnosed with muo and 20 control dogs matched for breed , age and gender .
bacterial abundance was measured using qpcr and 16s rrna sequencing .
we found that prevotellaceae were significantly less abundant in cases compared with controls ( p = 0.003 ) but there was no difference in abundance of f.prausnitzii .
there was no evidence of other differences in gut microbiota between groups .
these data , derived from this naturally - occurring canine clinical model , provide strong corroborative evidence that high abundance of prevotellaceae in the gut is associated with reduced risk for developing immune - mediated brain disease .

introduction disease in pet dogs treated by veterinarians forms a unique , frequently - overlooked , resource of biomedical translational data [ 1 ] .
there are many advantages of these diseases as models of their human equivalents .
first , they arise spontaneously , often through multifactorial etiologies similar to those that induce the parallel diseases in humans .
second , both pet dogs and humans share a common environment that may be a source of disease - causing risks .
third , diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions are broadly similar between humans and dogs with similar diseases .
within the field of neurology these features of similarity have been most extensively discussed in regard to spinal cord injury [ 2,3 ] .
in this study we investigate possible etiologies for another canine disease : meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin ( muo ) , which models many aspects of multiple sclerosis in people .
muo is an umbrella term used to summarize clinically - diagnosed immune - mediated inflammatory disease of the meninges , spinal cord and , especially , the brain of dogs [ 4 ] .
on histopathologic examination a variety of sub - types of muo are recognized , differentiated mainly by the predominance of white or grey matter involvement , the extent of necrosis and whether meninges are also inflamed [ 5,6 ] , but all sub - types show the common feature of inflammatory cell infiltrate .
in common with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) [ 7 ] , much effort has been directed toward searching for infectious causes for muo in dogs [ 8 ] , and has proved similarly unsuccessful .
traditionally , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( eae ) in rodents has been widely used as a model for investigating the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis [ 9 ] .
the self - directed immune response in eae can be initiated by injection of central nervous system ( cns ) - derived antigens into susceptible animals or by passive transfer of antibodies from affected animals [ 10,11 ] .
recent work has suggested that the self - directed immune response , which is dependent upon a suitable systemic immune environment , can in turn be modulated by components of the gut microbiome [ 12 ] .
thus , germ - free mice are resistant to development of eae , whereas those with wild - type gut microbiota remain susceptible [ 12,13 ] .
further support for this pathogenetic mechanism is provided by the changes in susceptibility to eae that can be elicited by using antibiotics [ 14 ] , oral immunization with vaccine strain of salmonella [ 15 ] , or probiotic mixtures [ 16 ] .
subsequent comparisons of the gut microbiome between ms patients and unaffected individuals have provided evidence that it may also play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ms [ 17,18 ] .
notably , an association has been made between development of ms and depleted populations of faecalibacterium prausnitzii , prevotella spp , or both [ 18 ] , which also supports a more widely held belief that these two bacterial types may be protective against development of self - directed immune responses [ 19 - 21 ] .
muo in dogs shows many histological and immunological similarities to both eae in rodents and ms in humans [ 22,23 ] , suggesting a common etiology and implying its value in interpretation of the potential importance of the gut microbiome in development of immune - mediated encephalomyelitis in humans. of further benefit is the low level of genetic diversity within defined dog breeds [ 24 ] , implying that genetic influences on susceptibility to this disease [ 25 - 28 ] can be controlled by experimental design .
in this study , we exploited the well - known breed , age and gender susceptibility [ 29 ] to design a case - control study in which to dissect the effects of gut microbial populations and other possible environmental triggers on development of muo in dogs .
we hypothesized that , in fecal samples obtained from dogs with muo , there would be a decreased abundance of f.prausnitzii and , or , prevotellacea , compared with that found in unaffected dogs .
methods materials and methods fecal samples were collected from dogs (' cases ') diagnosed with muo at the veterinary hospitals of iowa state university ( isu ) and texas a & m university ( tamu ) and stored in a - 80degreesc freezer for analysis at completion of case recruitment .
we also collected fecal samples from matched control dogs (' controls ') that were presented for diagnosis and treatment through the same veterinary school hospitals for other conditions .
cases typical cases of muo present with signs of brain dysfunction such as seizures or brainstem dysfunction ( often disorders of vestibular function ) , although signs of disease anywhere in the cns can be caused by muo .
diagnostic tests include magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scans and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) analysis .
important rule - outs include infectious causes of brain inflammation such as toxoplasma , canine distemper virus infection , neospora and , depending on geographical location , tick - borne diseases .
final confirmation of the diagnosis is achieved through post mortem examination but cases can usually be securely diagnosed through clinical tests and long - term response to therapy alone .
potential cases presented with various neurological signs relating to dysfunction of the brain ( we specifically excluded dogs that were suspected of having muo but had signs affecting the spinal cord or optic nerves alone ) , underwent routine mri scanning and csf analysis .
for inclusion as a case a dog had to show typical areas of diffuse hyperintensity on t2 - weighted mri scans ( fig 1 ) and increased cell counts (> 5 white cells per mul ) on csf analysis .
we also included any dogs that were definitively diagnosed at post mortem whether they fulfilled other clinical criteria or not .
dogs with evidence of gastrointestinal disease were specifically excluded , as were those that tested positive for any infectious disease .
any dog that had received oral antibiotics within 4 weeks of diagnosis , or that was diagnosed with cancer or immune - mediated disease affecting any part of the body , was also excluded .

this dog also exhibits ventricular asymmetry (' v ' indicates left ventricle ) , which is a common incidental finding in small breed dogs ( this was a pug ) .
after mri and csf had been obtained owners were asked for permission to take a fecal sample and for their assistance in completing the study record form to complete a short questionnaire ( see below ) .
this protocol was specifically reviewed and approved by the iowa state university institutional animal care and use committee ( log number 4 - 12 - 7347 - k ) .
controls these were dogs that presented to isu or tamu for investigation or treatment of other conditions but were of the same breed , gender and matched age .
in line with recommendations for case - control studies [ 30 ] , we specifically sought control animals from those presented to our veterinary university clinics because they were derived from the same population as the cases .
control dogs were subject to the same exclusions as cases , therefore dogs diagnosed with any gastro - intestinal disease , proven or suspected immune - mediated disease , cancer , or that had received systemic antibiotic therapy within 4 weeks were excluded .
owners of dogs that fulfilled these requirements ( identified through daily appointment records ) or that were of an age and breed likely to match in future with a case were approached to seek consent to obtain a fecal sample and complete the study record form , whether or not a matched case had previously been recruited .
fecal samples feces ( at least 30g ) were obtained from the rectum using a gloved finger and then stored in sterile containers in a - 80degreesc freezer until the end of the sample acquisition phase .
study record form a specifically - designed study record form recorded demographic data plus whether the dog was a case or control and the date of the most recent antecedent vaccination ( of any type ) .
vaccination of both cases and controls within the previous calendar month was recorded as a dichotomous variable .
the home environment in which the dog lived was categorized as rural , semi - rural ( small town ) or urban .
we also asked questions about diet in general terms , such as whether dry ( kibble ) , wet ( canned ) or home - cooked food was provided but did not request details .
any further follow - up information ( e.g. post - mortem report ) was added as free text .
gut microbiota analysis dna isolation : dna was extracted from the swabs with a mobio power soil dna isolation kit ( mobio laboratories , usa ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
sequencing of 16s rrna genes : the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified with primers 515f ( 5 ' - gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa - 3 ') and 806r ( 5 ' - ggactacvsgggtatctaat - 3 ') at the mr dna laboratory ( shallowater , tx , usa ) as previously described [ 31 ] .
the nextera ( r ) dna sample preparation kit including sequencing adapters and sample specific barcodes was used to prepare a dna library and sequenced at mr dna on an illumina miseq instrument .
the raw sequence data was screened , trimmed , filtered , denoised and barcodes and chimera sequences were depleted from the dataset using qiime v1.8 pipeline and uchime .
operational taxonomic units ( otus ) were assigned based on at least 97 % sequence similarity against the greengenes reference database .
sequences were rarefied to an even depth of 6,900 sequences per sample to account for unequal sequencing depth across samples .
observed species richness , chao 1 , and shannon indexes were determined using qiime .
the sequences were deposited in sra under accession number prjna319388 .
statistical analysis our study was designed to be analyzed using conditional logistic regression so as to take advantage of the case - control design , in which each case was matched with a single control of the same breed , gender and approximate age .
muo status ( yes or no ) was the dependent outcome variable .
the primary , pre - defined outcome measure - - based on the previous data on association in multiple sclerosis [ 18 ] - - was to test whether reduced abundance of f.prausnitzii and prevotellaceae was significantly associated with diagnosis of muo .
we also examined the association with two other putative risk factors for muo that might also have relevance for development of ms in people : vaccination status ( vaccinated within the previous month or not ) and environment ( in three graded categories ) .
analysis was conducted using stata 11.0 ( stata corp , college station , tx ) with p < 0.05 taken to indicate significance .
we also planned further exploratory comparison of the microbial populations between cases and controls using analysis of beta - diversity by unweighted unifrac distance metrics , similarly to a previously published report [ 31 ] .
statistical significance of the resulting distance metric was tested by analysis of similarities ( anosim ) using the qiime software .
there was no formal power calculation for this study , because we had little previous available information on which to base a sample size calculation , although the study by miyake et al ( 2014 ) [ 18 ] examined 20 human ms patients .
instead , we aimed to accumulate as many matched pairs as possible during the 2 - year period of study sponsorship ( american kennel club health foundation , grant # 01731 ) .
results samples with adequate documentation of all variables were collected from a total of 70 dogs , of which 39 were cases and 31 were controls .
as expected from previous studies [ 29 ] , the majority were small breed dogs (< 20kg bodyweight ) .
there were 20 matched pairs of dogs ( 40 dogs in total ) ; 5 pairs were male and 15 pairs were female ; this gender predominance is also similar to that reported in previous studies [ 29 ] .
the full breed list is : chihuahua ( n = 8 ) , maltese ( n = 6 ) , labrador ( n = 4 ) , pug ( n = 4 ) , shih - tzu ( n = 4 ) , then golden retriever , chesapeake bay retriever , weimeraner , dachshund , beagle , miniature pinscher and bichon frise ( each n = 2 ) .
cases were presented at the following periods in the year : 8 dogs in winter ( dec - feb ) ; 6 dogs in spring ( mar - may ) ; 3 dogs in summer ( jun - aug ) and 3 dogs in fall ( sep - nov ) .
pre - specified comparisons between cases and controls univariable analysis initially we examined the abundance of f.prausnitzii and prevotellaceae in cases and their matched controls , neither of which constituted normally - distributed data .
amongst all sampled dogs f. prausnitzii abundance ranged from 0 - 0.9 % of the total bacterial population and differed little between cases and controls ( wilcoxon paired signed ranks test , p = 0.198 ) .
in 9 of 21 cases and 5 of 21 controls no bacteria of this species were detected at all .
abundance of prevotellaceae ranged from 0.01 - 23.91 % across all sampled dogs but was significantly different between cases and controls ( wilcoxon paired signed ranks test , p = 0.003 ) ( fig 2 ) .
the data we recorded on diet proved to be insufficiently detailed to allow further analysis .
owners in both groups reported feeding similar diets in general terms : 17 / 21 cases and 19 / 21 controls were fed various brands of kibble food as their main , or only , diet .
however , most owners also indicated that there was variation in the daily diet and many dogs received variable amounts of table scraps and rewards .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0170589.g002 fig 2 dot plots illustrating relative abundance of f.prausnitzii ( a ) and prevotellaceae ( x103 ) ( b ) in cases and matched controls .
prevotellaceae abundance is shown on a log scale to improve detail ; this is not possible for f.prausnitzii because many animals had a zero score .
conditional logistic regression ( which takes advantage of pair - matching ) was used to examine the relationships between prevotellaceae and f.prausnitzii abundances and development of muo in more detail .
because the data populations were not normally - distributed and because we could not assume that relationships between bacterial abundance and development of muo were linear we divided the populations into tertiles ( i.e. low , medium and high abundance ) using an automatic function in stata .
this analysis revealed a tendency toward lower prevalence of muo in animals with higher abundance of f.prausnitzii , although this was not statistically significant in this population ( odds ratio [ or ] = 0.575 ; p = 0.192 ) .
in contrast there was a stronger , statistically - significant relationship of reduced likelihood of muo in dogs with higher abundance of prevotellaceae ( or = 0.303 ; p = 0.038 ) ( table 1 ) .
this was also reflected in the significant trend of decreasing odds of developing muo with increasing abundance of prevotellaceae ( chi2 = 6.89 ; p = 0.010 ) ( table 2 ) .

none of the unaffected control dogs had been vaccinated within the past month , whereas 5 / 20 cases had been , resulting in a statistically significant association ( fisher 's exact test , p = 0.047 ) .
living environment appeared to be weakly associated with development of muo ; overall the odds of developing muo were lower for dogs living in a rural environment that for those living in urban areas although not significant at the p < 0.05 level ( or = 2.810 ; p = 0.067 ; table 1 ) and this was also reflected in the significant trend of odds associated with increasingly more populated environments ( chi2 = 4.53 ; p = 0.033 ; table 3 ) .

when all three other variables were included together in multivariable conditional regression analysis there was considerable change in the association of diagnosis of muo with the dog 's living environment ( or = 10.936 ) , and moderate changes for association with f.prausnitzii ( or = 0.255 ) and with prevotellaceae ( or = 0.446 ) ( table 4 ) .
a series of subsequent exploratory analyses using stratification of exposure to both prevotellaceae and environmental categories , plus chi2 analysis of association between these variables , were impaired by null values in some categories .
nevertheless , inspection of the odds ratios ( and the instability of the figures for environment ) strongly suggests interaction amongst these variables .

nevertheless , our next step was preliminary exploratory analysis of the bacterial phyla abundances that were available from the sequencing studies .
similar studies have been conducted for human patients with ms [ 17,18 ] and we used a parallel methodology .
abundance of bacteria was recorded for each of 8 major phyla ( euryarchaeota , actinobacteria , bacteroidetes , deferribacteres , firmicutes , fusobacteria , proteobacteria , tenericutes ) .
abundance was recorded as zero in a substantial proportion (> 50 %) of all dogs in some categories ( euryarchaeota , deferribacteres , tenericutes ) leaving a total of 5 phyla for analysis of the relationship between abundance and diagnosis of muo .
for none of these phyla was there evidence of a statistical difference in abundance between cases and controls ( fig 3 ) and conditional logistic regression analysis of the matched - pair data using tertiles ( as described above for prevotellaceae and f.prausnitzii ) did not support an association between abundance of any of these bacterial phyla and development of muo ( table 5 ) .

alpha diversity as described by chao 1 , observed species ( species richness ) , and shannon diversity index were not significantly different between paired samples .
pcoa plots of unweighted unifrac distances ( fig 4 ) confirmed that there was not significant clustering between samples from case or control groups ( r - statistic = 0.054 ; anosim p = 0.15 ) .

discussion the analysis presented here supports an association between low prevotellaceae abundance and a diagnosis of muo in dogs , which also corroborates previous observations of an association between this bacterial group and diagnosis of ms in people [ 18 ] .
such corroboration , especially in a different species , is important because investigation of such a complicated system as the gut microbiome carries an inherently high risk of false discovery .
in this study , we specifically targeted only two bacterial populations in our primary pre - specified analysis implying that the risk of false discovery is low .
therefore , this evidence carries high value as corroboration of the importance of prevotellaceae in reducing risk of immune - mediated cns disease .
interestingly , low abundance of prevotellaceae has also been associated with parkinson 's disease in people [ 32 ] .
the rigid case - control design has enabled us to minimize the possible confounding factors of age , gender and genetic variability .
on the other hand , the possible association of low abundance of f.prausntizii with ms in people [ 17,18 ] has not been supported by our data .
this could simply be because of the relatively low power of our study , especially since many of the dogs had zero counts of this bacterium that may have confounded our ability to make associations .
nevertheless , our observations on matched pairs of dogs ( fig 1 ) would suggest that any effects must be relatively small since in many pairs the case had a higher abundance of f.prausnitzii than its matched control .
it is also possible that for some reason , such as diet , dogs in general , or dogs in this specific study , simply have low levels of f.prausnitzii and its association with immune - mediated disease in this species is not the same as in others .
lastly , in the study by canterel at el ( 2015 ) [ 17 ] the abundance of various bacterial groups , including faecalibacterium , was altered by vitamin d levels .
because dogs are not dependent on sunlight for production of vitamin d [ 33 ] , levels of this vitamin are likely adequate in dogs receiving a reputable manufacturer 's diet ( as all dogs in this study were ) and so the relationship between levels of this vitamin and abundance of this specific fecal bacterium may differ between the two species .
two further findings in this study may be useful in research into etiology of ms in humans .
first , we show the possibility that muo may , in some cases , be triggered by vaccination .
however , it is important that this finding be treated with caution : there were few dogs that had received vaccination and developed disease and so confidence in this result must be low .
nevertheless , the possibility of vaccine triggering ms or other cns demyelinating conditions has been previously studied in ms patients ; overall the conclusions have been that there is no evidence of increased risk [ 34,35 ] , although there is a suggestion that some individuals that are in sub - clinical stage of other demyelinating diseases may be triggered into disease by vaccination [ 35 ] .
our results are consistent with this explanation .
pet dogs can also have potential for helping to identify disease risk factors in the environment because they share living spaces with humans and so may have similar exposure patterns .
in this study , there is evidence that an urban environment is associated with increased risk of muo .
our study provides a little support for the notion that this risk is mediated via effects on the microbiome ( because there was weak evidence of interaction between environment and prevotellaceae abundance ) and so other mechanisms could be evoked .
in humans there is strong evidence that specific regions of the world carry risk for development of ms , in particular through linkage with vitamin d status [ 36 ] .
this would be an unlikely association in dogs because , as noted above , they do not manufacture vitamin d in the skin [ 33 ] ; instead , dogs may be able to provide evidence of more local environmental risk , such as the characteristics of a specific neighborhood that might play a role in susceptibility to immune - mediated cns diseases .
there is some previous evidence that urban living may be a risk factor for ms in people [ 37 ] , and this has been suggested to be because of increased hygiene .
it is possible that the same could apply to dogs living in urban environments ( since they have less exposure to wildlife , for instance ) but , alternatively , urban - living dogs may also have greater exposure to environmental toxins , such as organic solvents , which have been suggested as possible risks in human immune - mediated disease [ 38 ] .
on the whole , dogs are excellent sentinel species for environmental toxins because of their well - developed scavenging behavior .
finally , the association of high abundance of prevotellaceae with reduced likelihood of developing muo may have two general explanations .
as a ' fermenting ' group of bacteria , prevotellaceae produce butyrate , which has been identified as a specific inducer of treg cell differentiation [ 39 ] .
it is possible that this butyrate - producing metabolic profile may thus constitute the uniting mechanism of resistance to immune - mediated disease thought to be mediated by both prevotellaceae and f. prausnitzii [ 21 ] .
similarly , hormones produced by specific gut microbes could also directly influence the immune system [ 40 ] .
together these effects may modulate the changed intestinal permeability that has been detected in both ms patients [ 41 ] and rats with eae [ 42 ] .
on the other hand , it is also possible that high prevotellaceae abundance might result as a bystander effect of another interaction between the host ( immune system ) and the gut microbiome .
if this were true , a high population of prevotellaceae might simply be a biomarker of an immune system that is in a state that moderates inflammatory responses .
support for this notion is provided by their relatively low overall abundance : prevotellaceae were recorded in our study as a median of only ~ 0.2 % of the detected bacterial microbiota ; nevertheless , hormonal effects need not depend on high abundance .
what limitations might there be in the conclusions that can be reached from this study ?
first , because it was designed with the specific aim of exploring the possibility that reduced fecal bacterial population of one pre - specified species and one pre - specified family might be associated with development of this specific immune - mediated disease these results must be regarded as robust .
there is little risk of a false positive finding with this experimental design and , furthermore , the outcome largely corroborates previous evidence .
nevertheless , there are an almost unlimited number of unrecorded variables , such as specific dietary components , dog activity levels and gut permeability that might possibly have some influence on the development of muo and might have been overlooked in this study .
on the other hand , there is little reason to suppose that these factors would be systematically differently distributed between our case population and the controls , especially since we specifically selected our controls from animals presenting to our clinics for treatment .
further investigation in new sample populations is required to investigate all the possible interactions amongst gut microbiota , environment and other disease states .
finding different abundances of specific bacterial species between affected and unaffected groups in this study directs a spotlight at diet as a possible cause of these differences .
here we recorded only coarse information that proved impossible to analyze in a meaningful way since there was insufficient detail to be able to analyze the proportions of specific nutrients in any particular animal 's diet .
unfortunately , pet dog diets are often difficult to analyze because there is a great deal of variability in the way that owners feed dogs , both between individuals and between days .
further exploration of these dietary effects will require collaboration with a specialist nutritionist .
there is an almost infinite variety of environmental factors that could be involved in the risk of developing muo and it is not possible for all these to be investigated , or accounted for , in a single study .
for instance , there is some evidence that ingestion of non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) may alter not only gut permeability , but also may be associated with changes in gut microbiota [ 43 ] .
unfortunately , investigation of such effects is complicated because different nsaids appear to be associated with different gut microbial constituents and may also be affected by duration of therapy .
therefore , the possible effect of nsaid therapy , which was accounted for in this study as an unknown that would ' randomize out ' , provides an example of a factor that requires further investigation in the context of cns inflammatory disease .
on the other hand , in this study we did collect simple data on a small number of some possible explanatory variables , with the aim of providing some preliminary information on possible risk factors for development of muo in dogs and , by implication , possibly also for ms in humans .
the study design implies that the results of analysis of the association of these other factors ( apart from the targeted bacterial populations ) with development of muo must be regarded as tentative and will require further validation in repeated studies .
for instance , the apparent association of recent vaccination with development of muo is weak - - few dogs had been vaccinated in temporal proximity to disease onset and so the confidence intervals associated with this possible risk are wide - - implying low analytical power and low confidence in their repeatability .
furthermore , it is plausible that different vaccinations might differ in their effects .
the association of urban living with development of muo is more robust , especially since there is a strong trend of odds across the range of exposure ( table 4 ) and there is a previous suggestion of a link between urban living and development of ms in people [ 37 ] .
nevertheless , our environmental data are not highly detailed ( for instance we did not link zip code to population density ) and will therefore require verification in a new sample population .

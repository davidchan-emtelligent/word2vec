antioxidants diabetes lipid peroxidation s - allylcysteine 1 .
background diabetic mellitus ( dm ) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia which affects all the metabolic pathways ( 1 ) .
it is a systemic disease with relentless metabolic imbalances and pathological alterations in many tissues and premature mortality , costing for at least 10 % of total healthcare expenses in many countries ( 2 ) .
the present number of diabetics across the world exceeds 150 million , which has been predicted to rise to > 300 million by the year 2025 ( 2 ) , and it might be due to an increase in sedentary lifestyle , consumption of energy rich diet , and obesity ( 3 ) .
the occurrence of diabetes in urbanized countries is rapidly increasing , and this pandemic disease is one of the most persistent causes of death in developed countries .
according to recent studies in india , the number of diabetics wouldbe 84 - 224 million by the year 2025 and the most prevalence wouldbe among urban population ( 4 ) .
oxidative stress , the occurrence of oxidant factors plays a key role in the development of diabetes and its complications ( 5 ) .
persistent hyperglycemia can enhance the oxidative stress by increasing glucose auto - oxidation , nonenzymatic protein glycation , and activation of polyol pathway ( 6 ) .
it is suggested that the rise in free radical activity may play an imperative role in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation of cellular structures which are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetes .
in recent years , there has been increased interest in oxygen - reactive species generation and its role in the development of complications of diabetes .
recently , a growing concern has brought back to traditional and alternative medicines which replace the synthetic one .
results of the previous report had clearly stated that apart from traditional antidiabetic treatment , antioxidant therapy would be beneficial in diabetes ( 7 ) .
cytochrome p450 2e1 ( cyp2e1 ) , a source of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , metabolizes different endogenous compounds , viz , fatty acids , lipid hydroperoxides , and ketone bodies ( 8 ) .
ann et al .
( 9 ) reported that cyp2e1 is involved in the etiology and pathology of many diseases including diabetes ( 9 ) .
previous report has shown that the expression of cyp2e1 messenger ( m ) rna and protein is increased during diabetes ( 8 ) .
an increased cyp2e1 expression in various tissues of stz - induced diabetic rats including the liver has been reported recently ( 10 ). during diabetes , the elevated cyp2e1 level may be an important risk factor for oxidative stress ( 9 ) .
persistent hyperglycemia is always associated with increased oxidative stress ( 7 ) .
during the course of diabetes , autoxidation of glucose and declined antioxidant enzymes system seem to be relevant to the elevated oxidative stress ( 11 ) .
recent reports indicated that leptin and adiponectin were negatively modulated by oxidative stress ( 12 , 13 ) .
recently , plant based treatment has been thought to be effective for the prevention and control of various diseases including diabetes ( 14 ) .
garlic ( allium sativum , liliaceae ) is a rich source of bioactive compounds and is used in folk medicine for the treatment of various diseases .

discussion hyperglycemia induced by streptozocin in animals is considered to be a good model for the preface screening of drugs active against diabetes ( 32 ) .
beta - cells of pancreas are particularly liable to be damaged by stz which leads to hyperglycemic condition ( 33 ) .
in the present investigation , the diabetic rats were found to have higher glucose levels and lower level of insulin when compared to normal control rats. from the results of the present experiment , it was observed that the daily administration of sac during 45 days decreased the blood sugar in stz induced diabetic rats .
it is perhaps due to stimulation of insulin secretion from remnant pancreatic beta - cells , which in turn enhances glucose utilization by peripheral tissues of diabetic rats either by promoting glucose uptake and metabolism , or by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis ( 19 ) .
leptin and adiponectin , the chemical messengerssecreted by adipocytes , contribute to the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism ( 34 , 35 ) .
leptin acts to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure by activating specific hypothalamic receptors .
adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity by inspiring glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle ( 36 ) .
in the present study , the plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were found to be lowered in the diabetic control rats compared tothe control rats .
the results of our study are similar with the results of thule et al .
( 37 ) and kosova et al .
( 38 ) who found that plasma leptin and adiponectin were reduced in streptozocin - induced diabetic rats .
in contrast to our results , some authors reported that plasma leptin and adiponectin were increased in patients with type 1 diabetes ( 39 - 41 ) .
the reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. from these results , the decreased level of plasma leptin and adiponectin levels in insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus may well be caused by an insulin deficiency and / or increased lipolysis .
oral administration of sac to diabetic rats led to an increase in leptin and adiponectin levels .
these observations suggest that the increased plasma leptin and adiponectin levels after sac supplementation might be attributable to increased insulin level and decreased lipolysis ( 42 ) .
tbars assessment in plasma helps to assess the extent of tissue damage ( 43 ) .
in the present study , we found an increase in the levels of plasma hydroperoxide and tbars which is a key factor of lipid peroxidation.the major pathological outcome of membrane lipid peroxidation by free radical induction includes increased membrane rigidity , decreased cellular deformability , reduced erythrocyte survival , and lipid fluidity ( 44 , 45 ) .
tremendous increase in lipid peroxidation observed in diabetic rats is attributed to constant hyperglycemia which causes increased production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) .
this may be due to the oxidation of monosaccharide ( 46 ) which causes tissue damage in membranes ( 47 ) .
oral treatment with sac prevented the increased level of lipid peroxidation markers , which could be as a result of improved glycemic control .
vitamin c is a venerable water - soluble hydrophilic antioxidant which principally scavenges free radicals .
it disappears faster than other antioxidants on exposure to reactive oxygen species ( 48 ) .
vitamin c contributed up to 24 % of the total peroxyl radical - trapping antioxidant activity ( trap ) ( 49 ) .
we have noted a decreased level of plasma vitamin c in the diabetic rats .
this could be due to the increased consumption of vitamin c in the deactivation of the increased levels of reactive oxygen species or to the decreased gsh level , since the gsh is necessary for the recycling of vitamin c ( 50 ) .
administration of sac and gliclazide to diabetic rats tends to bring the vitamin c to near normal levels , which could be as a result of increased gsh level .
vitamin e , an imperative free radical scavenging chain - breaking antioxidant within biomembrane ( 51 ) interrupts the chain reactions of lipid peroxidation by reacting with lipid peroxyl radicals , thus defending the cell structures against damage ( 52 ) .
the amplified oxidative stress which accompanies a decrease in the level of antioxidants leads to decreased level of alpha - tocopherol in diabetics ( 53 ) .
treatment with sac and gliclazide brought vitamin e to near normal levels which could be as a result of decreased membrane damage .
glutathione ( gsh ) is a metabolic regulator and putative indicator of health .
gsh also functions as a free radical scavenger and in the repair of free radical caused biological damage ( 54 ) .
a marked depletion in the gsh content in plasma was observed in diabetic control rats .
reduced level of gsh in the circulation during diabetes represents its increased utilization due to oxidative stress ( 55 ) .
hence , drugs that prevent the generation of these oxygen free radicals or increase the free radical scavenging enzymes may be effective in stz induced diabetes .
furthermore , sac treatment showed a significant renovation in gsh content of diabetic rats which may be due to the antioxidant property of sac .
gpx plays a central role in the catabolism of h2o2 and the detoxification of endogenous metabolic peroxides and hydroperoxides which catalyzes gsh ( 56 ) .
the decreased activity of gpx in this study might be due to the lowered level of gsh ( 57 ) in diabetic state .
a marked increase in gpx was observed in diabetic rats treated with the sac .
this might reflect the antioxidant potency of sac which reduced glucose levels and prevented glycation and inactivation of gpx .
thus gpx activity was induced to scavenge free radicals in diabetic rats .
ceruloplasmin is a copper containing oxidase which inhibits lipid peroxidation by binding with the copper ( 58 ) .
during diabetes , the ceruloplasmin level is increased due to the generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide ( 59 ) .
the level of ceruloplasmin was significantly increased in diabetic rats when compared to control rats which may facilitate the scavenging action on peroxyl radicals ( 60 ) .
treatment with sac prevented the increased level of ceruloplasmin compared to diabetic control .
in sac treated diabetic rats , low plasma ceruloplasmin levels might be due to an increase in their utilization to neutralize free radicals .
sod , an essential defense enzyme catalyzed the dismutation of superoxide radicals ( 61 ) .
due to hyperglycemia , the autoxidation of glucose results in the formation of hydrogen peroxide which inactivates sod ( 62 ) .
therefore , the accumulation of h2o2 may be one of the explanations for decreased activity of sod in diabetic condition .
sod is accountable for the detoxification of deleterious oxygen radicals ( 63 ) .
the observed decrease in sod during diabetes could result from inactivation by h2o2 or by glycation of the enzyme , which have been reported to occur in diabetes ( 64 ) .
in this study , the oral supplementation of sac and gliclazide maintained the sod activities at near control level .
namely , our results indicated that the preventive effects of sac may be due to inhibition of lipid peroxidation and scavenging of free radicals by its antioxidant nature .
catalase is a haem containing ubiquitous enzyme which removes toxic free radicals in vivo .
cat reduces h2o2 produced by dismutation reaction and prevents generation of hydroxyl radicals ( 65 ) .
the present study revealed that cat activities were significantly inhibited in erythrocytes of diabetic group which could be due to increased oxygen metabolites causing a decrease in the activity of the antioxidant defense system .
further , it was suggested that decreased antioxidant enzyme activity in dm is due to nonenzymatic glycosylation of the enzymes ( 66 ) .
treatment with sac and gliclazide has reversed the cat activities , which could be as a result of decrease in the levels of lipid peroxidation and or decreasing utilization for scavenging free radicals .
stz intoxication alkylates dna and causes induction of cyp2e1 protein and mrna ( 67 ) .
incomplete reduction of oxygen due to leakage of electrons through the electron transport chain leads to the excessive production of ros catalyzed by cyp2e1 .
the elevated ros production , lipid peroxidation and the lowered antioxidant defense are common in diabetes ( 7 ) .
in the present study , increased liver cyp2e1 activity was observed in diabetic control rats .
sac supplementation leads to decreased blood glucose level and increased plasma insulin level in diabetic rats .
lower body glucose concentration ameliorated the induction of cyp2e1 and associated with liver injury ( 7 ) .
in conclusion , the present study demonstrated that sac administration significantly improved glycemic , antioxidant status and adipocytes hormones in diabetic rats by enhancing insulin .
in conclusion , our result confirmed the antidiabetic action of sac , and showed the favorable effect of sac on erythrocyte antioxidants defense system and adipocytes hormones in addition to its antidiabetic effect .

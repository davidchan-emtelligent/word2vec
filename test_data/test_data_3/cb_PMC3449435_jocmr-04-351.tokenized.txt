bleeding from ectopic varices is rare and accounts for only 1 % and 5 % of all variceal bleeding .
however , once the bleeding starts , it becomes difficult to control and is sometimes fatal .
we faced a 65 - year - old man with ruptured duodenal varices and injected n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate into the spurting duodenal varices .
as a result , oozing was successfully controlled .
subsequently , the patient remained hemodynamically stable , and no repeat - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate injection was needed .
he was finally discharged one week later and has been followed - up for the last one year with no signs and symptoms to suggest any recurrence of bleeding .
duodenum varice rupture introduction ectopic varices have been reported to develop in various organs such as duodenum , colon , gall bladder , uterus , vagina , urinary bladder , and abdominal stomas [ 1 - 7 ] .
although the recognition of varices at unusual sites has long been described in the literature , standard diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have not yet been established for intestinal varices , which are rarely formed on other parts of the digestive tract than the gastroesophageal region [ 8 ] .
several promising treatment have been reported , but bleeding ectopic varices are regarded as potentially life - threatening [ 9 ] .
we experienced ruptured duodenal varices which were successfully treated with n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate ( histoacryl ) injection .
case report a 65 - year - old man had a known history of liver cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis b infection .
on this admission , he initially presented at the emergency department with melena for the past two days and hypotension .
hemoglobin level had dropped from 13.9 g / dl three weeks ago to 10.2 g / dl. at gastroscopy , no bleeding esophageal varices were seen , and no fresh blood or old blood clots were observed in the stomach and duodenum .
however , active bleeding , shown in arterial phase , in the third part of duodenum was detected in following abdominopelvic ct examination ( fig. 1 ) .
finally , a bleeding duodenal varix at the third portion , approximately 1.5 cm in diameter , was found by using pediatric colonoscopy ( fig. 2a ) .
all 3 ml n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate ( histoacryl ) was injected to the oozing duodenal varix , and active bleeding was successfully controlled ( fig. 2b ) .
subsequently , the patient remained hemodynamically stable , and no repeat n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate injection was needed .
follow up ct , in pre - contrast phase , showed injected histoacryl eradicating the duodenal varix at the third portion of duodenum ( fig. 3 ) .
he was finally discharged one week later with a stable hemogloblin level of 12.5 g / dl. the patient has been followed - up for the last one year with no signs and symptoms to suggest any recurrence of bleeding .
figure 1 high attenuated lesion is observed at the third part of duodenum in the arterial phase of the abdominopelvic computed tomography scan ( arrows ) .
figure 2 a : emergent endoscopic findings of the distal third portion of duodenum using pediatric colonoscope demonstrate a blood - oozing erosion on the surface of large nodular duodenal varices ; b : mixture of n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate and lipiodol is being injected .
figure 3 computed tomography scan shows properly obliterated collateral vessels with n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate and lipiodol ( arrows ) .
discussion bleeding from ectopic varices is rare and accounts for only 1 % and 5 % of all variceal bleeding [ 1 ] .
however , once the bleeding starts , it becomes difficult to control and is sometimes fatal .
a surgical resection or interventional embolization of varices is sometimes useful when the varices are localized .
however , surgical options , such as a portosystemic shunt or variceal ligation , are limited to selected patients .
unfortunately , many patients are not good operative candidates for such treatment modalities .
the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( tips ) procedure is an effective modality in the therapy of cirrhotic patients with bleeding from ectopic varices unresponsive to conservative management [ 10 , 11 ] .
however , several data showed that tips frequently fail to eradicate gastric varices ; the reported success rate is only 50 % [ 12 ] .
moreover , there is recent evidence showing a higher re - bleeding rate after creation of a tips , compared to trans - catheter sclerotherapy [ 13 ] .
endoscopic procedures are relatively faster and easier than surgery or radiologic intervention .
among two major endoscopic management , endoscopic variceal ligation and endoscopic injection sclerotherapy , endoscopic variceal ligation is not entirely effective in blocking the flow of blood to the affected area and evl can cause ulcers [ 14 ] .
therefore , endoscopic injection sclerotherapy seems to be favored for ruptured duodenal varices [ 15 ] .
n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate injection completely blocks a blood supply to a relatively large area and causes less tissue damage than other agents .
in our case , n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate with lipiodol injection was useful in achieving hemostasis .
in conclusion , we experienced a rare case of a rupture of ectopic varices located on the third portion of the duodenum .
endoscopic injection sclerotherapy with n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate was proved to be very effective in treating ruptured duodenal varices .

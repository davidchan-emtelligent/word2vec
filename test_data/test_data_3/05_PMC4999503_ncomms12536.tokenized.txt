however , the mechanisms for number perception are still not clear ; some maintain that the system calculates numerosity via density estimates - - similar to those involved in texture - - while others maintain that more direct , dedicated mechanisms are involved .
here we show that provided that items are not packed too densely , human subjects are far more sensitive to numerosity than to either density or area .
in a two - dimensional space spanning density , area and numerosity , subjects spontaneously react with far greater sensitivity to changes in numerosity , than either area or density .
even in tasks where they were explicitly instructed to make density or area judgments , they responded spontaneously to number .
we conclude , that humans extract number information , directly and spontaneously , via dedicated mechanisms .
humans as well as many other species have the ability to perceive the number of items , numerosity , but the mechanism by which this is achieved is unclear .
here the authors provide strong evidence in support of a spontaneous perception of numerosity without reliance on density and area estimation .
perceiving the number of objects is a fundamental survival skill for many animal species12 .
humans are capable of estimating numerosity very early during development , probably even at birth3 .
precision for numerosity improves steadily with age up to about 30 years4 and , importantly , predicts mathematical proficiency567 .
but how humans and animals estimate numerosity remains an open question .
both animal891011 and human1213 research points to dedicated neural structures for numerosity perception , but it remains an open question as to whether observers estimate numerosity per se , or rather infer it from other visual quantities that covary with numerosity , such as density .
in part the debate has revolved around the whether numerosity estimation operates over unsegmented visual textures141516 or whether the scenes need first to be segmented into objects1718192021 .
there has been a good deal of evidence for both sides of the debate151622232425262728293031 , with no definitive resolution .
we have recently suggested that both number and texture - like mechanisms may operate , depending on the density of the displays32 .
at low to moderate densities , where the items can be segregated , there is clear evidence for numerosity mechanisms ; at higher densities , where the objects become crowded , texture - like mechanisms may be at work .
the evidence for the different mechanisms comes largely from different psychophysical laws operating at different densities , weber 's law at the moderate densities where the objects can be segregated , and a square root law at higher densities22 .
there is also a clear dependence of eccentricity , implicating crowding - like mechanisms33 .
but the basic question remains whether numerosity is sensed directly , via dedicated mechanism , or derived indirectly from density and area , as has been suggested16252731 .
to this end we created a two - dimensional ( 2d ) space representing density , area and numerosity , and examined which dimensions human observers were most sensitive .
the results show that at moderate densities , observers were far more sensitive to numerosity than to either density or area .
only at very high - dot densities did observers tend to use density and area information directly .
results the general procedure was to measure discrimination thresholds for stimuli that varied over two dimensions , area and density .
figure 1 shows an example of the stimulus space , on logarithmic axes , with the origin depicting the standard area and density of a particular condition , and the ticks on the axes showing octave changes ( doubling or halving of that dimension ) .
as numerosity is the product of area and density , it can be depicted in this logarithmic space as the + 45degrees diagonal .
we then measure discrimination thresholds in all directions within the space to determine the direction of maximum sensitivity , and relate that to the directions of area , density and number .
the logic is similar to that of measuring macadam ellipses in color - space34 .
indeed the thresholds of experiment 1 are well described by ellipses , with short radii corresponding to the most sensitive direction in this space .
discrimination boundaries in the area - density space the first experiment measured sensitivity in the area - density space with an assumption - free , odd - one - out task .
three stimuli were displayed : two identical standards ( 40 sq degs , and either 12 , 24 , 48 , 64 or 128 dots ) , and the oddball which differed from the standard , in a given direction and distance within the area / density space ( see ' methods' section for details ) .
subjects indicated which stimulus was different from the other two , without necessarily knowing in which dimension it differed .
figure 2a plots proportion correct responses ( pooled across the two subjects ) when the sample patches contained 24 dots , and the target patch varied in area and density around that value .
the data were well fit by 2d gaussian functions , whose per cent - correct contours describe ellipses .
these are clearly very elongated , and slanted orthogonal to the numerosity axis : this means that under these conditions , the most sensitive dimension is numerosity ( the least change was needed in that direction for the standard to be discriminated ) .
although subjects did not know which dimension had changed , they were far more sensitive to changes in numerosity than to either area or density alone , and spontaneously tended to use that information .
conversely , the poorest performance was when numerosity was kept constant , moving along the main diagonal , although the separate changes to area and density were just as great as when moving along the other diagonal .
to quantify the effect across numerosities we extracted from each map two indexes : the orientation of the short radius of the ellipse ( 0degrees is aligned with area , 45degrees with number , 90degrees with density ) and the ratio of the s.d. of the long - to short - radius .
figure 2b,c plot these for data averaged over two subjects , for numerosities ranging from 12 to 128 .
interestingly , for a large range of numerosities ( all but 128 ) , the discrimination ellipse is tilted close to 45degrees and with a high aspect ratio of about four , indicating that numerosity provides the most useful information for the discrimination task .
at the highest numerosity used , tilt remains around 45degrees , but the aspect ratio drops below two , suggesting that numerosity has a lesser advantage for dense stimuli .
explicit judgments of density , area and number the first experiment showed that without instructions , or information about what aspects of the stimuli are changing , subjects spontaneously use numerosity rather than either area or density , questioning the suggestion that area and density are spontaneously used for estimating numerosity .
in the second experiment we go further in explicitly asking subjects to make discriminations based on density , area or number ( in separate sessions ) .
in this task , we did not score the responses as correct or incorrect , but mapped the proportion ' more ' ( number , area or density ) on the area - density landscape , and fitted cumulative gaussian functions .
again , it is the orientation of these functions that indicates the most sensitive dimension .
figure 3 shows sample maps for the three tasks for a numerosity of 12 dots , averaged over subjects .
if subjects responded as instructed , correctly identifying changes in either number , area or density , the choice planes for the three maps should be aligned orthogonally to those dimensions , as shown in the insets : 45degrees for number , 90degrees for density and 0degrees for area .
surprisingly , however , this did not occur : both density and area judgments showed a strong spontaneous bias towards numerosity .
the three maps do not follow their individual ideal - observer predictions , but are all very similar to each other .
the numerosity map has a choice plane slanted at 38degrees , near the predicted 45degrees .
but the slant of density is 54degrees , nearer 45degrees than the predicted 90degrees , and that of area is 23degrees , about half way between the predictions for number ( 45degrees ) and area ( 0degrees ) .
figure 3d,e summarize the data of the discrimination by plotting the two parameters of the decision maps , orientation and width of the 2d psychometric functions , as a function of test numerosity .
the orientation of the maps of numerosity judgments is close to veridical across the range of numerosities .
however , area and density are both highly biased towards the number axis , indicating that even when asked to make density or area discriminations , judgments are highly biased towards number .
interestingly , at increasing numerosities , the preferred axes become more aligned with the real axes of their dimensions ( fig. 3d ) .
figure 3e shows how the weber fraction ( essentially the s.d. of the logarithmic cumulative gaussian function ) varies with numerosity. that for number is fairly flat , with a slope of only - 0.01 , while density decreases with a slope of - 0.36 , closer to a square root relationship ( slope of - 0.5 ) .
the slope of the regression for area was - 0.21 , between constant and square root .
this result reinforces previous studies showing that numerosity judgments tend to follow weber 's law , while density judgments are better described by a square root relationship3233 .
the green curve shows the predictions for numerosity ( orientation and weber fraction ) , if it were based on the product of density and area ( see ' methods' section for details of the predictions ) .
the simulations predict an orientation near veridical , as observed , but weber fractions far higher than those obtained , especially at low numerosities .
the simulations also predict a decrease in weber fraction with numerosity , while the data are in fact quite flat .
this clearly speaks against the idea that numerosity derives from area and density , at least for reasonably sparse stimuli .
figure 4 shows individual data for two base numerosities , plotting weber fractions within the area / density space ( large open symbols are group averages ) .
the green symbols show the predictions for numerosity based on the product of density and area .
for the higher numerosity ( n = 128 ) , the results are not too far from the predictions , although the predictions tend to be too biased towards the area axis ( because area thresholds were worse than density ) .
nevertheless , the results are not completely incompatible with the notion that number estimates may be derived from the product of area and density , as the mean thresholds lie very close to the predictions .
however , the data at more moderate densities ( n = 12 ) tell a completely different story .
here numerosity judgments clearly do not depend on density and area , as the thresholds are far lower than the prediction from the two components .
on the contrary , rather than numerosity being based on density , it would appear to be the other way round , that density judgments are based on number .
even area - - a completely different concept - - is strongly influenced by number .
in a pilot study we explored the possibility of constructing an arbitrary metric based on the ratio of density and area , which we termed ' clutter ' .
this was essentially an ' anti - numerosity ' task , where subjects had to respond more when the stimulus was dense and small , and less when sparse and large .
even experts - - including all three authors - - failed at this task , even after extensive training .
there was no systematic pattern of results , with individual subjects choosing different strategies , and the weber fractions very large .
even at high numbers the responses did not become close to veridical , suggesting that it is perceptually very difficult to blend area and density , unless the product is numerosity .
it appears that the concept of ' anti - numerosity ' does not exist .
discussion in this study we investigated what cues human subjects spontaneously use when judging numerosity , density and area , by varying simultaneously area and density over a wide 2d space .
the results show that at low to moderate densities , sensitivity is far higher to numerosity than to density or area .
when subjects did not know what aspects of the stimuli were changing ( odd - one - out task ) , they spontaneously based decisions on numerosity .
even when explicitly asked to base their decision of density , observers used numerosity rather than density for discriminations .
area discriminations were also strongly influenced by numerosity .
these data speak against the idea that numerosity is extracted from area and density , as sensitivity to numerosity was lower than to either area or density. and when asked to judge density , subjects used numerosity as a primary cue .
at high densities the situation changes : density and area seem to be sensed more directly , and numerosity thresholds are consistent with being calculated via density and area .
this agrees with previous work showing that texture mechanisms can come into play in numerosity judgments of dense stimuli32 , and also shows that the technique can , under these circumstances , reveal that numerosity can derive from density and area .
our data speak clearly to the important point in the dispute as to whether number and density share common resources1623242527293132 .
previous evidence has suggested that number judgments can be influenced by geometrical attributes : for instance , there is a mild positive influence of area25 ( that is , larger patches appear more numerous ) .
the current data agree with those observations as the plane for numerosity judgments is slightly slanted below 45 degrees ( average 38degrees ) indicating that number estimation is mildly influenced by area .
it has been argued that this influence parallels that of density , which is also strongly influenced by area25 .
our data confirm these previous observations but reveal the bigger picture , which is quite different : the influence of area on density in fact results from the density choice plane following the number axis .
our data also confirm that density judgments are particularly noisy at low numerosities and improve at higher numerosities , tending towards a square root law22 .
area judgments are also performed rather poorly at low numerosities .
as both area and density judgments are performed poorly , they would not make a very useful basis set from which to calculate numerosity , at least at low - mid densities ; on the contrary , it seems that information about number is used to aid area and density discriminations .
it may be argued that the low numerosity thresholds do not necessarily imply the existence of direct numerosity mechanisms , but that people are more practiced at making numerosity than density or area judgments , and can therefore do so with more precision .
we find this unlikely for several reasons .
first , numerosity thresholds at low densities were less than a quarter those of density and area , while learning seldom results in effect - sizes more than a factor of two35 .
second , as mentioned above , the advantage of numerosity over density is greatly reduced for dense stimuli , where it is almost consistent with the density - area model of numerosity : if it were simply the case that subjects were more accustomed to judging number than density , this should influence the results for dense stimuli as well .
however , observers were quite comfortable with the notion of estimating area and density , and did so very well under appropriate conditions .
finally , during the course of this experiment , all observers - - particularly the authors - - spent many hours training on density and area judgments ( far more than in the normal perceptual learning paradigms ) , and they showed very little improvement .
we therefore believe that the low thresholds reflect sensory rather than cognitive mechanisms .
furthermore , in a series of pilot data we attempted to document what happens if people are asked to mentally combine density and area : we asked them to respond to ' clutter ' an arbitrary , ' anti - numerosity ' dimension .
clutter is not a very intuitive concept , and indeed we found that this type of estimation was almost impossible for observers , even after extensive training .
after eight 50 - trial sessions of weber fractions remained very high , and the response criteria variable , with no measureable improvement .
this is interesting , as the converse judgment , which can also be considered as a pairing of density and area , is performed veridical , consistently and with low - weber fractions .
only at the very high numerosities was the pattern of results consistent with a combination of area and density .
in previous papers we have suggested that the cut - off between the two systems occurs where there was a transition from weber 's law to a square root law22. with equal area patches , cut - offs were 2 items / degree2 in fixation , which decreased to 0.8 and 0.4 items / degree2 at 5 and 15 degrees eccentricity33 .
however , that does not preclude the possibility that numerosity mechanisms extend further into the high - density range , with considerable overlap between mechanisms .
the current data uses a paradigm in which both area and density change , minimizing possible confounds , and shows that direct number estimation occurs even at 2 items / degree2 or more , even in the periphery .
the idea that number is derived from density and area may be only to explain those cases at high density .
our results provide strong evidence that number may be calculated by mechanisms that do not involve density or area. by analogy , we know that velocity can be described as the ratio of space and time , but there is no evidence that the visual system computes each independently and calculates the ratio ; on the contrary , there is very good evidence for neural mechanisms specialized for velocity36 .
indeed , the system seems to be capable of converting time to space via velocity , rather than the other way round3738 .
similarly , the fact that number can be described as the product of density and area does not mean that the system is obliged to calculate it that way , rather than by more direct means .
interestingly , a recent study by stoianov and zorzi30 has shown that encoding of number develop naturally during unsupervised learning of a hierarchical generative model of perception .
the training concerned only the efficient coding of the sensory data , yet numerosity selectivity emerged as a statistical property of the deepest layer of the model. that coding for number emerges naturally without supervision is consistent with it being a basic property of sensory systems , and that the neural structures subserving this task may be quite simple .
for example , dehaene and changeaux21 have demonstrated that a simple normalization stage with template filters can extract item identity , which can then be fed to a subsequent integrator to estimate numerosity .
one reason why understanding numerosity perception is important is its close relationship with mathematical abilities .
halberda et al.6 showed that numerosity discrimination predicts math performance in pre - school and school - aged children , confirmed by several other more recent studies ( for a recent meta - analysis39 - - but see also404142 ) .
interestingly , however , neither density nor area discriminations predict math performance , either in adults or children434445 .
this is consistent with the existence of independent mechanisms for estimating number , and potentially important in understanding the links between numerosity and mathematical abilities .
in summary , this study clearly shows that provided items are not packed too densely , estimating numerosity does not require separate estimates of density and area ; on the contrary , under many conditions estimating density and area rely on estimates of numerosity .
these results point to specialized mechanisms for estimating numerosity , mechanisms completely independent of those involved with density or other seemingly related attributes .
these mechanisms probably work at reasonably high levels , after objects have been segregated into ' countable ' quantities .
the visual brain has evolved to perceive and interact with a complex visual environment .
one strategy for dealing with the complexity is the evolution of brain modules that encode the most salient and invariable attributes of objects and scenes .
it is not really surprising that one of these emerging modules should comprise mechanisms that estimate effortless and rapidly the number of items of interest .
methods participants seven subjects with normal or corrected - to - normal vision participated in this study : 2 of the authors and 5 subjects naive to the goals of the study ( 3 men , 4 women , 26 - 38 years old , mean age 28 years ) .
only two of these participated in the first study , all in the second .
experimental procedures were approved by the regional ethics committee ( comitato etico pediatrico regionale - - azienda ospedaliero - universitaria meyer - - firenze ( fi ) and are in line with the declaration of helsinki ) .
stimuli stimuli employed throughout all the experiments were clouds of dots with base radius of 3.6 degrees displayed at 12degrees eccentricity ( see fig. 1 ) .
dots were light - or dark - grey ( weber contrast 0.4 ) , created by convolving a disc of diameter 20 ' with a gaussian of s.d .
7 ' .
the percentage of light to dark dots was drawn at random for each patch ranging from 20:80 to 80:20 to avoid subjects doing the tasks with either of the subclasses of dots .
patch configurations were calculated offline to meet two conditions : minimum allowed centre - to - centre dot distance was 20 ' , and aspect ratio of the patches had to be within 0.78:1 ( short to longest axis ) .
the standard patch could contain one of six different numerosities ( 12 , 24 , 32 , 48 , 64 , 128 ) , but always had a radius of 3.6 degrees ( area 40 sq deg. ) : density therefore ranged from 0.3 to 3.2 dots per deg2 .
stimuli were varied using the method of constant stimuli , changing area and density ( and consequently number ) around the standard for that condition ( see fig. 1 ) .
in experiment 1 ( odd - one - out ) area and density varied from - 1.5 to 1.5 octaves in steps of 0.25 octaves , with the constraint that when both area and density were changing the overall change could not exceed 1.5 octaves .
in experiment 2 ( explicit judgment ) area and density changed from - 0.75 to + 0.75 octaves in steps of 0.125 octaves with the caveat that when changing area and density simultaneously the change on each dimension could not exceed at 0.625 octaves .
experimental procedures in the first experiment , designed to measure unbiased thresholds in the area - density space , subjects chose the odd stimulus of three dot clouds , all presented simultaneously at 12degrees eccentricity at the vertices of a virtual equilateral triangle for 250 ms. two of the patches ( chosen at random ) had the same area and density , and comprised the standard .
the other ( the odd - one - out ) differed in either area or density , chosen from the constant stimuli described above .
subjects performed on average 5 sessions of 170 trials each , for a total of about 850 trials per numerosity .
in the second experiment , subjects were asked to make an explicit judgment : which of two stimuli had the higher area , density or number ( in separate sessions ) .
stimuli were presented 12degrees left and right of screen centre simultaneously for 250 ms. each subject completed on average 6 sessions of at least 80 trials for a total of 480 trials for each condition yielding a total of approximately 10,000 trials .
data analysis in the odd - one - out experiment , for each numerosity data were analysed by plotting per cent correct responses as a function of the area and density of the odd stimulus .
yield maps like those of fig. 2 , with the abscissa showing change in area and ordinate change in patch density .
as the axes are logarithmic , the forward diagonal represents numerosity ( area times density ) , and the other diagonal constant numerosity .
data were fitted with 2d elliptical gaussian functions : where x and y are obtained by clockwise rotation of the area and density space ( and ) .
the elliptical gaussian has five free parameters : orientation of short - radius , widths of the short and long radii and the position of the centre in the area and density space .
the orientation of the short radius is the axis of maximal sensitivity as subjects discriminate best when the odd stimulus varied in that direction .
the ratio between long and short radii is an index of selectivity of the sensitivity .
in the explicit judgment experiment , for each numerosity and task requirement we plotted the percentage of times the test patch was perceived as ' more ' as a function of area - and density - change .
again , this yields a 2d map of density change plotted against area .
both area and density employed in the analysis were calculated stimulus by stimulus via estimation of the surface covered by the convex hull of the dot cloud .
the subject response maps are then interpolated filling a space spanning from - 0.75 to 0.75 octaves and fit with a 2d psychometric cumulative gaussian function .
the fitted function was a one - dimension cumulative gaussian function operating on an arbitrary axis x obtained via rotation of the area - density space .
the function has three parameters : rotation angle , width and offset .
the width indicates the amount of change required to go from 50 to 84 % ' more ' responses .
for choice planes off the area or density axis , the width is expressed as the sum of the changes in area and density required to attain 84 % categorization .
predicting numerosity from area and density thresholds to simulate the noise performance of an observer that calculated number from density and area , we assumed that the log of number was obtained as a summation of log area and log density .
performing the simulation in the log of the physical quantities has the advantage that combination of area and density is a simple summation .
it can be easily demonstrated that when summing two variables the overall noise is and signal to noise is . for this reason the threshold lies along the vector composition of the two sources save for an improvement of a factor . to infer the noise in each judgment we projected the thresholds for area and density task onto their respective physical axis ( arrows in fig. 4 ) .

figure 1 area - density stimulus space .
( a ) schematic illustration of the 2d space describing the stimuli used in this study .
the origin is the ' standard ' stimulus for a specific condition , always of radius 3.6 degrees ( area 40 sq degrees ) , with 12 , 24 , 32 , 48 , 64 or 128 dots ( density ranged from 0.3 to 3.2 dots per deg2 ) .
the abscissa plots relative stimulus area , and the ordinate relative density .
the positive diagonal represents relative number .
lines orthogonal to this diagonal have constant number .
all axes are logarithmic : each tick shows an octave ( base - two logarithm ) interval , a doubling or halving of that quantity .
note this is a schematic illustration .
( b ) example of the actual stimuli for numerosities 12 , 24 , 48 and 128 .
figure 2 discrimination boundaries in area - density space .
( a ) 2d psychometric function for measuring thresholds in the area / density space with the ' odd - one - out ' task , for a standard of 24 dots .
per cent correct ( pooled across two subjects ) is plotted as a function of log area and log density ( see heat map at right ) .
the maps show interpolated responses .
the raw data were fit with a 2d gaussian varying between 100 and 33 % ( chance ) .
the dashed lines show the 50 and 75 % performance .
( b ) 2d psychometric function measured with a standard of 128 dots .
conventions as in a .
( c ) the orientation of the short radius ( maximal sensitivity ) of the best - fitting 2 - d gaussian , as a function of numerosity .
the orientation tended to + 45degrees at all numerosities , aligned with the number axis .
( d ) ratio of s.d. of the long to short radii , as a function of numerosity .
for low - to - moderate numerosities the oval was strongly elongated , by a factor of four .
even at the highest numerosity , the oval remained elongated orthogonal to the numerosity axis , with an aspect ratio of 1.7 .
figure 3 explicit number area and density judgments in area - density space .
( a ) 2d psychometric functions for explicit number comparisons ( which patch appeared more numerous ) for a standards 12 dots , plotting per cent ' more ' pooled across six subjects , as a function of log area and log density .
the maps are obtained by linear interpolation ( see heat map at right for values ) .
the raw data are fitted with a 2d cumulative gaussian error function , varying between 0 and 100 % .
the dashed lines show +/ - 1 s.d. ; weber fraction is the total change needed to attain 84 % correct responses .
the small insets at right show how an ideal observer would perform , responding correctly to the task .
however , the data for all three tasks tended to oriented near the numerosity axis , suggesting that numerosity was used for all tasks .
( b ) explicit density judgments : conventions as in a .
( c ) explicit area judgments : conventions as in a .
( d ) the orientation of the choice axes ( deviation from vertical ) , as a function of numerosity .
for the numerosity task ( blue symbols ) , the functions were oriented near + 45degrees at all numerosities ( orthogonal to the number axis ) , suggesting that numerosity provided the primary information for the task .
the functions for density ( red symbols ) were also oriented near + 45degrees at low numerosities , suggesting that density judgments also relied on numerosity .
area judgments ( black symbols ) were also strongly influenced by numerosity at low numerosities .
the green curves show the predictions for numerosity judgments , if they were based on the product of density and area .
( e ) weber fractions ( log ( change in area ) + log ( change in density ) at threshold ) , as a function of numerosity .
the lines are best - fitting linear regressions , with slopes of - 0.36 , - 0.21 and - 0.01 respectively for density ( red triangle ) , area ( black circle ) and number .
weber fractions for number remained constant over the range ( weber 's law ) , while density decreased with a slope near - 0.5 ( square root law ) .
area also decreased with numerosity .
the green curves show the predictions for numerosity judgments , if they were based on the product of density and area .
for high numerosities , the predictions are reasonable , but at low numerosities far too high .
figure 4 threshold changes for number density and area discrimination .
( a ) area and density thresholds ( changes required to attain 84 % consistent response ) for the density , area and number judgments ( respectively red , black and blue ) , for a base numerosity of 12 dots .
dashed lines orthogonal to the numerosity diagonal indicate regions of constant number .
small squares are individual data , large hollow squares ( means ) , error bars are s.e.m. arrows display projections on the physical axis of area and density thresholds on their respective axis .
green diamonds indicate the predicted thresholds for number if it were calculated from area and density ( clearly far higher than actually obtained ) .

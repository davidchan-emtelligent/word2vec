background oridonin , the major terpene found in rabdosia rubescens ( henmsl. ) hara , is widely used as a dietary supplement and therapeutic drug .
oridonin has been proven to possess good anti - tumour activity , but little is known about its effect on angiogenesis .
the aim of this study was to investigate the antiangiogenic effects of oridonin in vivo and in vitro and prove that oridonin anti - tumour activity is based on suppressing angiogenesis .
methods in vitro , the antiangiogenesis effect was studied by proliferation , apoptosis , migration , invasion , and tube formation experiments on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( huvecs ) .
in vivo , using the tg ( fli1 : gfp ) zebrafish model , the embryonic vasculogenesis and postnatal regeneration were evaluated .
the vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) signalling pathway gene expressions were assessed by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) .
furthermore , the inhibition effects on tumour growth and metastasis were observed using a xenograft zebrafish tumour model and xenograft nude mouse tumour model .
angiogenesis was assayed by immunostaining with cluster of differentiation 31 .
importantly , the proteins were identified as being differentially expressed in an in vivo model by two - dimensional electrophoresis - mass spectrometry ( 2d - ms ) and western blot ( wb ) .
results the results indicated that oridonin inhibited huvec proliferation , migration , invasion , and tube formation and induced cell apoptosis .
oridonin inhibited zebrafish angiogenesis during embryonic development and tail fin regeneration .
rt - pcr showed that oridonin decreased the vegfa , vegfr2 , and vegfr3 expressions in zebrafish , while the tp53 expression increased .
moreover , oridonin had strong effects on tumour growth and metastasis in vivo .
2d - ms identified a total of 50 proteins differentially expressed ( 17 up - expressed , 28 down - expressed ) .
lastly , wb showed that claudin 1 , claudin 4 , and claudin 7 were closely related to tumour growth and metastasis .
conclusion this study demonstrated that oridonin could inhibit tumour growth and metastasis , which mainly based on oridonin antiangiogenic effects .
claudin 1 , claudin 4 , and claudin 7 were the main contributors to the mechanism .

the identification of small molecules that block angiogenesis and are safe has been a challenge in drug development .
specific anti - angiogenic agents have arisen as an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of angiogenesis - dependent diseases , especially tumour metastasis [ 1 - 4 ] .
the vascular endothelial growth factors ( vegfs ) , especially vegf - a , are key angiogenic factors .
the vegf receptor vegfr2 is the primary receptor mediating the angiogenic activity of vegf through distinct signal transduction pathways [ 5 , 6 ] .
anti - angiogenic drugs , e.g. , bevacizumab ( avastin ( r )) , inhibit vegf signalling by blocking either vegf ligands or vegfrs .
however , therapy - associated problems and severe adverse events are desirable to be overcome [ 7 , 8 ] .
to exploit safer and efficient agents , researchers have investigated natural products .
in addition to their direct effect upon cancer cells , a number of herbal remedies have been identified to suppress angiogenesis and thereby reduce tumour growth .
certain chinese herbal medicines contain natural anti - angiogenic compounds that need to be proven effective and safe for human use [ 9 - 12 ] .
oridonin , an effective diterpenoid component , has been proven to possess anti - tumour activity [ 13 - 18 ] .
oridonin inhibits the formation of capillary - like networks , indicating that it exhibits anti - angiogenesis activity [ 19 ] .
dong et al. proved the oridonin inhibits tumour growth and metastasis through anti - angiogenesis by blocking the notch signalling [ 20 ] .
liu et al. indicated that the oridonin anti - tumour effect was mainly based on its anti - proliferation and anti - angiogenesis [ 18 ] .
however , the anti - tumour effect of oridonin based on its inhibition angiogenesis and its mechanism has still not been fully elucidated in vivo .
in the present study , we chose the tg ( fli1 : gfp ) zebrafish model , and investigated how oridonin inhibits angiogenesis .
the anti - tumour effect of oridonin in vivo was observed in a xenograft zebrafish tumour model and xenograft nude mouse tumour model .
importantly , 2d - ms , rt - pcr , and wb identified anti - tumour mechanisms based on the inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo .

the cells presented as circular , round or oval , with small nucleoli , nuclear fission , nuclear pulp ratio decrease , which prompted the cancer cells in the direction of high differentiation .
the control group cell density was larger , with a diffuse distribution of a disordered arrangement that did not form nests or an adenoid structure .
the cells were pleomorphic , round or oval , with a large nucleoplasm ratio , with deep nuclear staining deep , large and obvious nucleoli , and nuclear fission , which showed obvious necrosis .

further more , the wb results proved that the claudin 1 , claudin 4 , and claudin 7 proteins were closely related to the mechanism of tumour growth and metastasis ( fig. 15 ). fig. 15 claudin family genes and protein relative expressions upon exposure to various concentrations of oridonin for 7 d. a relative gene expression comparison ; b protein levels in mouse tumour tissue sections detected by wb ; c relative protein expression comparison .
the asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from the control group (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) discussion at present , many cancer cases and deaths can be prevented through reducing the prevalence of risk factors , while increasing the effectiveness of clinical care , particularly for disadvantaged populations .
we will facilitate the broader application of existing cancer control knowledge [ 25 , 26 ] .
angiogenesis is required for tumour growth and metastasis .
more than 90 % of deaths from solid tumours are attributable to tumour metastasis [ 27 ] .
substantial research has been devoted to determining the effect of angiogenesis on tumour development and progression , and the mechanism of action of angiogenesis inhibitors is different from that of traditional chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy , providing them with potential in cancer management [ 28 - 31 ] .
moreover , researchers have focused on the health benefits of natural products that influence some steps in cancer - induced angiogenesis , especially in traditional chinese medicine [ 32 - 34 ] .
identifying novel angiogenesis inhibitors can promote the discovery of new drugs for angiogenic diseases .
the in vitro experiments in the present study showed that oridonin induced huvec apoptosis , and inhibited the proliferation , migration , invasion , and tube formation .
the in vivo experiments demonstrated by vascular assays that oridonin inhibited angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos , suppressed the regenerated of the caudal fins of zebrafish larvae , and suppressed the regenerative angiogenesis of caudal fins in adult zebrafish .
these results were consistent with those of a previous study , which found that oridonin could inhibit the formation of capillary - like networks in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells [ 19 ] .
phenotypic changes in angiogenesis are always involved in angiogenesis - related signalling pathways .
vegf signalling is mainly mediated by vegfr2 , and blocking the activity of vegfr2 can limit angiogenesis [ 35 , 36 ] .
vegfa is a key angiogenic factor , and vegfr2 , is the primary receptor mediating the angiogenic activity [ 5 , 6 ] .
vegf signalling is a potential target of antiangiogenic therapy .
vegfr3 mainly participates in early blood vessels formation [ 37 ] .
tp53 is one of the important tumour suppressor genes , which can make a gene stable and regulate cell growth , differentiation , and aging .
tp53 is known as the " guardian gene " [ 38 , 39 ] .
therefore , our study at least partially elucidates the mechanism of the antiangiogenic activity of oridonin , which may be related to the down - regulation of vegfa , vegfr2 , and vegfr3 expression , while up - regulation the tp53 expression .
we chose the xenograft zebrafish tumour model and observed the oridonin activity on tumour metastasis .
the anti - tumour effect of oridonin was weaker than that of bevacizumab .
however , from the observations of the heartbeat , body weight and survival time , we demonstrated some advantages of oridonin in application .
moreover , 2d - ms identified a total of 50 proteins differentially expressed , of which 17 were up - expressed and 28 down - expressed .
moreover , among the 50 proteins , 12 proteins ( 3 up - expressed , 9 down - expressed ) are closely related to tumour growth and metastasis : 5 ' - nucleotidase domain - containing protein 3 , cathepsin , napor protein ( up - expressed ) ; high mobility group protein b2 , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4h isoform 2 /( eif4h ) , transcriptional activator protein pur - alpha , claudin - 4 , casein kinase ii alpha 1 subunit , cytochrome b - c1 complex subunit 2 , cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 , er membrane protein complex subunit 1 isoform x2 , and nuclear receptor coactivator 5 ( down - expressed ) .
in summary , these proteins can regulate the tumour cell proliferation , migration and growth by direct or indirect effects [ 40 - 49 ] .
we chose the xenograft tumour mouse model and observed the oridonin activity on tumour growth and metastasis .
the result verified the great anti - tumour effect of oridonin .
accordingly , the mice tumour tissue sections were subjected to he staining and cd31 fluorescent staining , which showed the oridonin anti - tumour activity based on the inhibitory effect of angiogenesis .
importantly , the claudin - 4 protein was focus of the research .
claudins are crucial structural and functional components of tight junctions , which are essential for holding endothelial and / or epithelial cells together .
claudin family proteins have a significant role in tumour growth , metastasis , and angiogenesis , and are highly expressed in many types of epithelial tumours [ 50 , 51 ] .
claudin 4 is a transmembrane protein , which is often restricted to tight junction structures and has been shown to provide a barrier to paracellular diffusion .
research suggested that claudin 4 plays an important role in tumour growth and malignancy via the control of cell proliferation , migration , apoptosis , and metastasis [ 52 - 54 ] .
significantly , claudin 4 expression may be useful to distinguish switch / sucrose non - fermentable complex - deficient undifferentiated carcinomas from sarcomas [ 55 ] .
finally , our research showed that claudin 1 , claudin 4 , and claudin 7 were closely related to tumour growth and metastasis .
claudin 1 , claudin 4 and claudin 7 are down - expressed .
claudin 1 and claudin 7 can be used in cancer diagnosis and treatment [ 56 ] .
claudin 4 has a correlation with tumour angiogenesis , and can be used as a treatment target protein , which was consistent with our research results [ 52 , 53 ] .
moreover , the research conformed that claudin 4 and vegfa , vegfr2 , vegfr3 , and tp53 were all contributed to the anti - tumour effect based on the inhibition of angiogenesis ( fig.16 ) .
a meta - analysis indicates that claudin - 4 over - expression is associated with progress of gastric cancer and poor survival in gastric cancer patients [ 57 ] .
aberrant claudin 4 expression plays an important role in the clinicopathological characteristics of gastric cancer [ 58 ] .
claudin 4 is thus a potent target for cancer therapy , and that an anti - claudin 4 antibody is a promising candidate anticancer agent [ 59 , 60 ]. fig. 16 the different targets and signaling pathways regulated by oridonin .
the pictorial summarized mechanism for inhibition of angiogenesis and anti - tumor effect by oridonin .
arrows indicate regulations by oridonin treatment in experimental results conclusion the present study has demonstrated that oridonin inhibited angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo .
further study indicated that the inhibited angiogenesis effect from oridonin might be based on the down - regulation of vegfa , vegfr2 , and vegfr3 , and the up - regulation of tp53 gene expression .
claudin 1 , claudin 4 , and claudin 7 were the main proteins contributing to the oridonin anti - tumour effect based on the inhibition of angiogenesis .

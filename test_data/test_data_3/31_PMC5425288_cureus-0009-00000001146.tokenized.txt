though pet / ct in this setting has been reported to have high negative predictive values (> 90 %) , positive predictive values have been reported at approximately 50 % , leading to high rates of false positivity ( fp ) and troubling management decisions for both patient and practitioner .
the objective of this study was to identify patient , disease , treatment and imaging factors that might be associated with a higher likelihood of fp on initial post - treatment pet / ct imaging for patients treated for hnc .
materials and methods a retrospective chart review was performed on 84 patients treated for hnc who received radiation therapy ( rt ) as part of their overall management from october 2005 to august 2013. of the patients screened , 19 were found to have mucosally based squamous cell carcinoma ( scc ) with positive initial post - treatment pet / ct studies ( 23 %) .
fisher 's exact test was used to analyze the association between categorical variables and fp , including patient 's gender , disease laterality , primary tumor site and stage , nodal and overall stage , high dose rt fraction size , number of rt fractions completed , total rt dose , biologically effective dose and timing of pet / ct acquisition .
wilcoxon rank - sum test was used to analyze the association between continuous variables and fp , including patient age , total elapsed days of rt , an amount of infused fluorodeoxyglucose 18f - fdg , pre - pet / ct serum glucose levels , and maximum standardized uptake value suvmax .
statistically significant findings were those that were deemed p < 0.05 .
results among patients with positive initial post - treatment pet / ct scans for treated hnc , there was a lower proportion of higher primary disease stage associated with fp versus true positivity ( t - stage 3 - 4 : 20 vs 78 % , respectively , p = 0.023 ) .
we also discovered that 50 % of patients that underwent confirmation for fp findings suffered serious complications as a direct consequence of invasive exploratory procedures .
conclusions although pet / ct is known for its exceptional negative predictive value (> 90 %) in the post - treatment setting for hnc , high rates of fp remains a clinical challenge .
our study suggests that tumor stage ( t - stage ) may impact fp rates in positive initial post - treatment pet / ct scans .
we recommend careful multidisciplinary discussion regarding positive pet / ct studies in the post - treatment setting for hnc , particularly if invasive intervention is considered .

introduction it is estimated that over 48,000 new cases of head and neck cancer ( hnc ) were diagnosed in the united states ( us ) in 2016 [ 1 ] .
patients with hnc commonly present with locally advanced disease , requiring a multidisciplinary approach for optimal outcomes , with radiation therapy ( rt ) delivered either in the post - operative [ 2 ] or definitive setting [ 3 ] .
despite improvements in therapy , loco - regional failures ( lrf ) remain a substantial problem and often lead to cancer - related death [ 4 ] .
although options for the persistent or recurrent disease are limited and associated with low success rates [ 5 ] , early detection of lrf has been shown to improve the ability for salvage [ 6 ] .
imaging is often acquired during the post - treatment assessment period and findings suggestive of lrf can be very clear and corroborated with gross disease found on physical and / or endoscopic examination .
biopsy should be obtained in these settings for histologic confirmation prior to further management .
at other times , positive findings on post - treatment imaging may be less clear for lrf , particularly when highly sensitive imaging is used and non - descript post - treatment changes , including inflammation and fibrosis , may confound the diagnosis .
deciding upon invasive confirmatory procedures for positive findings , in these more ambiguous scenarios should be done with caution , as invasive procedures within irradiated fields are known to be associated with morbidities [ 7 - 8 ] .
positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( pet / ct ) , which offers improved accuracy of disease detection over conventional techniques of imaging [ 9 ] , is becoming increasingly utilized for hnc post - treatment surveillance [ 10 - 11 ] .
although negative predictive values ( npv ) greater than 90 % are consistently reported when pet / ct is utilized for post - treatment head and neck cancers ( hnc ) surveillance , positive predictive values ( ppv ) have been as low as 50 % , suggesting that false positives ( fp ) remain a challenge to physicians when management decisions are needed [ 12 - 13 ] .
therefore , we have performed a retrospective study to determine factors that are associated with false positivity in post - treatment pet / ct imaging .
materials and methods patients after approval by the university of arizona institutional review board ( 1300000696 ) , a retrospective chart review was performed on hnc patients treated from october 2005 to august 2013 who received rt as part of their overall management .
patients treated by multidisciplinary effort including surgical resection and / or systemic therapy were included .
we included only patients diagnosed with mucosal squamous cell carcinoma ( scc ) and excluded any patients presenting with distant metastatic disease .
patients were not required to have an initial diagnostic pre - treatment pet / ct but were required to have had pet / ct imaging as part of their post - treatment assessment. from a total of 84 patients with hnc screened , 73 were discovered to have scc histology , and 71 patients with the mucosal - based disease. from those remaining patients , 19 were found with positive findings in the irradiated head and neck region on initial post - treatment pet / ct scans .
treatment planning simulation procedure was performed with a head , neck , and shoulder thermoplastic mask type - s head , neck & shoulder perforated mask ( civco medical solutions , coralville , ia , united states ) with the patient 's head cradled within a resting device ( timo headrest , civco medical solutions , coralville , ia , united states ) .
ct simulation imaging was acquired with a philips brilliance big bore scanner ( andover , massachusetts , united states ) in 3 mm slices from skull vertex to mid - thorax without and / or with the administration of isovue contrast ( bracco imaging , monroe township , new jersey , united states ) based on appropriate kidney function .
all patients were treated with external beam radiation therapy ( ebrt ) with 3d conformal or intensity - modulated radiotherapy ( imrt ) technique .
patients were treated with either sequential or simultaneous integrated boost technique for differential dosing to high , intermediate , and low - risk regions depending on findings at the time of diagnosis if treated definitively or upon pathologic evaluation in the post - operative setting .
for patients treated in the definitive setting , gross tumor volume ( gtv ) was delineated with the assistance of diagnostic imaging .
a 5 mm uniform margin was then applied to the gtv utilizing the treatment planning software auto - expansion tool to create a clinical target volume ( ctv ) to account for the microscopic spread .
the ctv was edited from normal anatomic boundaries and an additional margin of 3 - 5 mm was added for the planned target volume ( ptv ) to account for daily set - up uncertainty and physiologic motion .
intermediate - and low - risk neck ptvs were also created based on the primary site of origin and its potential pattern of lymphatic failure based on previous publications [ 14 - 15 ] .
normal tissues were contoured including optic nerves and chiasm , brainstem with 3 mm expansion , bilateral cochleas , spinal cord with 5 mm expansion , bilateral parotid glands , lips , oral cavity , mandible , superior constrictor muscles , larynx , esophagus , and bilateral brachial plexus .
during the planning process , a d95 target coverage was applied for each ptv per international commission on radiation units and measurements ( icru 62 ) recommendations and normal tissues were constrained according to well - accepted guidelines [ 16 ] .
a similar process for treatment planning except for gtv was undertaken in the post - operative setting , though areas of resected gross disease constituted the highest risk ptv , which was delineated after careful review of pre - surgical imaging , operative and pathologic reports .
radiation therapy seventeen patients were treated with definitive intent rt and two patients were treated post - operatively .
all patients were treated with once daily high - dose rt fraction sizes between 1.8 gy to 2.12 gy , except one patient who was treated with definitive intent rt utilizing 1.25 gy twice daily fractionation .
the median duration of rt for patients treated in the definitive and post - operative setting was 51 elapsed days ( range : 39 - 67 days ) and 54.5 elapsed days ( range : 54 - 55 days ) respectively .
the median number of treatment fractions delivered for patients in the definitive and post - operative setting was 35 ( range : 33 - 61 ) and 35 ( range : 33 - 37 ) , respectively .
patients who were treated with definitive intent received a median dose of 70 gy ( range : 66 - 76.25 gy ) to the planning target volume ( ptv ) encompassing gross disease , while post - operative patients received a median dose of 66.3 gy ( range : 66 - 66.6 gy ) to the ptv region encompassing previously resected gross disease .
rt doses were then converted into bed3 and bed10 with the following equation : bedx = nd ( 1 + d / alpha / beta ) ; where x = three or 10 , n = total number of fractions delivered , d = fractional rt dose in gy , and alpha / beta = three or 10 , respectively .
the median bed3 for patients who received rt in the definitive setting was 117 gy ( range : 108 - 127 gy ) , and for post - operative patients , the median bed3 was 108 gy ( range : 107 - 110 gy ) .
the median bed10 for patients who received rt in the definitive setting was 84 gy ( range : 79 - 91 gy ) , and for post - operative patients , the median bed10 was 79 gy. post - treatment pet / ct assessment prior to november 2010 , 13 patients were referred to outside institutions for post - treatment pet / ct imaging .
the remaining six patients underwent pet / ct scanning at our institution utilizing a standardized protocol .
pet / ct scans were obtained following four - six hours of fasting after serum glucose levels were found to be < 175 mg / dl. sixty +/ - 10 minutes following iv administration of 18f - fdg at 0.1 mci / kg , sequential pet and ct imaging was performed with an integrated general electric ( ge ) discovery 690 pet / ct scanner ( little chalfont , united kingdom ) with a time of flight algorithm from skull vertex to mid - thigh .
helical ct imaging was taken with 120 kvp , 1.5 mm collimation and 0.94 pitch parameters .
images were then interpreted by a board - certified nuclear medicine physician using software with fusion capability ( mirada medical , denver , colorado , united states ) .
positive findings in post - treatment pet / ct scans were defined as those with standardized uptake value ( suv ) max > 2.0 within irradiated volumes of the head and neck with or without ct correlates .
positive findings were discussed within a multidisciplinary setting and recommendations for further workup included repeat serial imaging and clinical examination or histologic diagnosis with biopsy .
findings that were positive on post - treatment pet / ct that were eventually discovered negative for disease recurrence were considered fp. statistical methods categorical variables including patient gender , disease laterality , primary tumor site , primary tumor ( t ) stage , nodal ( n ) stage , overall stage , high dose rt fraction size , number of rt fractions completed , total rt dose , biologically effective dose ( bed ) 10 > 84 vs. <= 84 , bed3 > 110 vs. <= 110 , timing of pet / ct acquisition (> 90 vs. <= 90 days ) , and positive findings within or outside original areas of primary or nodal disease prior to treatment and their associations with fp findings on post - treatment pet / ct were evaluated using fisher 's exact tests .
continuous variables including patient age , total elapsed days of rt , amount of infused 18f - fdg ( mci ) , pre - pet / ct serum glucose ( mg / dl ) measurements and suvmax were analyzed for associations with fp using wilcoxon rank - sum tests .
statistically significant associations were reported with p - values < 0.05 .
no corrections were made for multiple comparisons .
all statistical analyses were performed using stata 14.1 ( statacorp , college station , texas , united states ) .
results patient and disease characteristics fifteen males and four females with a median age of 65 years ( range : 42 - 79 years ) with hnc of mucosal scc histology treated with rt as part of their overall management and with positive post - treatment pet / ct were analyzed .

fifty - three percent of patients were stage iva , followed by stage iii ( 21 %) , stage ivb ( 11 %) , stage ii ( 11 %) and stage i ( five percent ) .
sixty - three percent patients were treated with definitive intent rt concurrent with platinum - based chemotherapy .
median follow - up was 13 months ( range : four to 84 months ) and all patients received post - treatment pet / ct imaging .
post - treatment pet / ct findings all 19 patients received post - treatment pet / ct imaging .
the median time interval between the completion of rt and the initial post - treatment pet / ct scan for all patients was 95 days ( range : 28 - 711 days ) .
nine patients were confirmed to have lrf and therefore true positive ( tp ) findings on post - treatment pet / ct imaging .
the median time interval between completion of rt and post - treatment pet / ct scan for patients with tp was 95 days ( range : 65 - 711 days ) .
patients with tp were determined to have lrf by histologic confirmation ( five patients ) , serial clinical examination ( three patients ) , or repeat imaging ( one patient ) .
two of the nine patients with tp findings had ct correlates within the areas of elevated suv on pet , which corresponded to areas of known pre - treatment disease .
one patient with a tp post - treatment pet / ct , initially presented with a t3n0m0 , stage iii , right laryngeal scc ( figure 1 ) , had an incomplete response to definitive chemort and underwent salvage laryngectomy , but died of his disease shortly thereafter .

one patient was followed clinically without lrf , five were serially imaged with resolution of initially positive findings , and four underwent histologic confirmation with negative biopsies for lrf .
none of the 10 patients with fp findings had ct correlates in the areas of elevated suv .
two of the four patients with fp findings that underwent biopsy had a direct complication of the invasive diagnostic procedure , including one patient who suffered laryngeal edema after direct laryngoscopy requiring an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by permanent tracheostomy .
the other patient suffered post - biopsy hyoid osteomyelitis and despite a prolonged course of antibiotics , subsequently decompensated in speech and swallowing function ( figure 2 ) .

discussion pet / ct is an effective imaging modality for detecting disease in patients that have been previously treated for hnc [ 10 - 11 ] .
although pet / ct scanning is known to have an excellent negative predictive value ( npv ) for post - treatment hnc assessment , low ppv in the 50 % range leads to troubling fp findings , which are often difficult for practitioners to manage [ 12 - 13 ] .
in our small cohort of 19 patients with positive findings on initial post - treatment pet / ct , we found a ppv of 47 % , which is in keeping with that described in the literature .
when positive results on the initial post - treatment pet / ct are discovered with gross disease persistence or recurrence found on clinical examination , there is a general consensus that prompt histologic confirmation that should be obtained by tissue biopsy , as early salvage therapy has been shown to improve patient outcomes [ 6 ] .
when positive findings on the initial post - treatment pet / ct are more equivocal or ambiguous ; however , the decision to biopsy for disease confirmation becomes less clear as the inherent risks associated with invasive diagnostic intervention may potentially outweigh its benefits [ 17 ] .
this is particularly true for tissue that is at increased risk for poor wound healing , necrosis or infection has given previous irradiation [ 7 - 8 ] .
in our study , 50 % of patients that underwent invasive confirmatory procedures for fp findings on initial post - treatment pet / ct suffered serious complications as a direct consequence of their tissue biopsy .
the objective of our study was to identify patient , disease , treatment , and imaging factors that might be associated with a higher likelihood of false positivity on initial post - treatment pet / ct scan for hnc patients .
to our knowledge , no other study to date has been published focusing on this particular phenomenon .
we found that among patients with fp versus tp findings on post - treatment pet / ct , there was a lower proportion of higher primary disease stage ( t - stage 3 - 4 : 20 vs 78 % , respectively , p = 0.023 ) .
it is well known that advanced t - stage is not only a prognostic factor but also predictive of lrf in patients treated for hnc [ 18 ] .
patients with lower primary disease stage ( t - stage 1 - 2 ) and positive post - treatment pet / ct scans may , therefore , be at higher risk for fp , because elevated suv in the irradiated regions may be associated with persistent inflammatory changes within the surrounding normal tissue and tumor bed rather than malignancy .
inflammation induced by rt is well described [ 19 - 20 ] , although factors affecting persistent 18f - fdg uptake and fp rates on post - treatment pet / ct scans are not well understood .
some have suggested that the timing of pet / ct acquisition post - treatment may play a role in inaccurate findings and that a minimum of three months should pass before surveillance imaging is pursued [ 21 - 25 ] .
our study showed that timing of pet / ct acquisition when categorically evaluated as taken before or after 90 days post - treatment was not associated with fp findings ( p = 0.170 ) .
other parameters we evaluated have previously been documented as having an rt dose relationship and increasing incidence with higher bed , including dermatitis and mucositis , which are thought to be immune / inflammatory modulated processes [ 26 - 27 ] .
in our study , larger than conventional fraction rt dose (> 2 gy ) , total rt dose (>= 70 gy ) , and higher beds did not show statistically significant associations with fp findings .
variable techniques in pet / ct acquisition and interpretation are known to exist across institutions which may impact the accuracy of post - treatment pet / ct imaging for treated hnc patients .
specific machine parameters such as scanner resolution and partial volume effects , in addition to patient pre - pet / ct serum glucose measurements , amount of 18f - fdg activity injected , lean body mass or body surface area , timing from injection of 18f - fdg tracer to image acquisition , 18f - fdg tumor and tissue metabolism kinetics and region of interest demarcation , among other factors are thought to effect post - treatment pet / ct interpretation [ 28 ] .
our analysis showed that there were no significant differences in pre - pet / ct serum glucose , an amount of 18f - fdg activity injected , and suvmax between patients found with fp versus tp on post - treatment pet / ct imaging .
a substantial proportion of the patients treated for hnc suffers heightened anxiety during the surveillance period after curative management [ 29 - 30 ] .
it is not surprising that if a positive finding is discovered on post - treatment pet / ct imaging , both physician and patient may become distressed .
multidisciplinary discussion , however , should be held on whether invasive intervention should be pursued as the first approach for narrowing the diagnosis , as our data and others have shown 50 % ppv in these circumstances .
one might consider instead , other methods of imaging including diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , dynamic contrast - enhanced mri , or evaluation of metabolic kinetics of post - treatment pet / ct. our analysis is limited by its retrospective nature and the small number of positive post - treatment pet / ct events .
out of a total of 84 patients with hnc initially screened from our institution , only 19 were found to have mucosally - based scc with positive post - treatment pet / ct studies ( 23 %) .
additionally , some of our post - treatment pet / ct studies were performed at outside facilities , due to lack of pet / ct capability at our institution prior to november 2010 .
as a result , unfortunately , pet / ct technique parameters other than pre - pet / ct serum glucose , an amount of 18f - fdg activity injected and suvmax were not available for evaluation in patients scanned out the outside facilities .
conclusions although pet / ct is increasingly utilized for post - treatment hnc assessment with excellent reported npvs in the literature (> 90 %) , ppvs associated with post - treatment pet / ct scanning for this population of patients is dismal at approximately 50 % , which results in high rates of fp findings , as shown in this study .
after curative management of hnc , a positive finding on initial post - treatment imaging is disconcerting for both patient and practitioners alike .
options for further management are wide ranging and could include invasive salvage or diagnostic interventions , which may lead to complications that were resultant to interventions performed unnecessarily .
fifty percent of patients in our study who were found with fp post - treatment pet / ct scans that underwent invasive procedures suffered significant morbidity .
therefore , we sought to find factors that might be associated with increased fp rates on post - treatment pet / ct for treated hnc , in order to provide guidance to practitioners found in this quandary .
based on our results we found an association with the lower t - stage disease with increasing fp on initial post - treatment pet / ct scans for treated hnc .

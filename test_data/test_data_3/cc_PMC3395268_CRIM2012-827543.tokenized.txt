microangiopathic antiphospholipid - associated syndromes ( mapss ) are reported as encompassing several conditions mainly affecting the microvasculature of selected organs : the liver in hellp syndrome ( hemolysis , elevated liver enzymes , and low platelet ) ; kidney , brain , and skin in ttp ( thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ) .
it is predominant in patients with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome ( aps ) .
a recent report suggests that aps is not only a thrombotic disease but also associated with microangiopathic features , and it can explain the greater prevalence of hellp syndrome in these patients .
we here report a case of maps during pregnancy associated with systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) in early second trimester .
1. introduction obstetrical complications in revised classification criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome ( aps ) include three or more unexplained spontaneous abortions before 10 weeks of gestation , intrauterine fetal death , and one or more premature births of a morphologically normal neonate before 34 weeks of gestation with continuous antiphospholipid ( apl ) antibodies present in plasma [ 1 ] .
aps is clearly related to maternal morbidity , and it is known to be a major cause of fetal loss due to a thrombotic tendency leading to placental infarction during pregnancy [ 2 ] .
a recent report suggests that aps is not only a thrombotic disease but also associated with microangiopathic features , and it can explain the greater prevalence of hellp ( hemolysis , elevated liver enzymes , and low platelet count ) syndrome in these patients [ 3 ] .
hepatic infarction , retinal vascular occlusions , and deep venous thrombosis ( dvt ) have now been reported in patients with hellp syndrome [ 4 ] .
microangiopathic antiphospholipid - associated syndromes ( mapss ) are proposed as encompassing several conditions mainly affecting the microvasculature of selected organs : the liver in hellp syndrome ; kidney , brain , and skin in ttp ( thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ) and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) [ 5 ] .
among hellp cases diagnosed antepartum , 90 % are in the third trimester and the syndrome rarely occurs before 27 weeks of gestation [ 6 ] .
however , it is wellknown that several patients with aps suffer hellp syndrome at very early onset despite low - dose aspirin and heparin combined therapy [ 7 ] .
we here report a case of maps during pregnancy associated with systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) in early second trimester .
2. case report a 39 - year - old japanese woman with a history of one miscarriage at 6 weeks' gestation had become pregnant under anticoagulation treatment of 2500 u danaparoid sodium because of her osteoporosis and osteonecrosis of femoral head and 100 mg aspirin per day from 4 weeks' gestation at nagoya city university hospital .
she has had a 22 - year history of sle , which had been in remission for more than 4 years under a treatment of 5 mg prednisolone daily .
at this point , our case was not diagnosed with aps , because she suffered from only one miscarriage .
however , we planed to do anticoagulant treatment during pregnancy , because her lupus anticoagulant ( la ) [ 8 ] was ascertained to be strongly positive by diluted activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) methods and diluted russel 's viper venom time ( rvvt ) before pregnancy .
prednisolone therapy was interrupted before this pregnancy because the patient thought it affected infertility .
her edema and protein urea appeared at 17 weeks' gestation ( table 1 ) .
her blood pressure was 121 / 78 mmhg and laboratory studies showed anti - beta2 - glycoprotein i ( beta2gpi ) 9.4 u / ml ( normal range < 1.9 ) , aptt 30 % , la by aptt 30 seconds , la by rvvt 1.47 , and urinary protein 2.0 g / day at 17 weeks of gestation .
at 21 weeks of gestation , she had body edema and protein urea ( 8.1 g / 24 h ) .
laboratory studies were shown in table 1 .
at 21 weeks of gestation she was hospitalized because of severe edema and acute renal dysfunction , and treatment of 40 mg prednisolone daily started at 22 weeks of gestation .
she had developed epigastralgia and vomiting .
thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia together with liver and renal dysfunction and an elevated level of c - reactive protein were observed ( table 1 ) .
at 22 weeks and 6 days of gestation , emergency cesarean section was performed because of fetal distress with loss of variability and severe late deceleration , abnormal doppler flow velocimetry waveform analysis suggestive of fetal hypoxemia , and the hellp syndrome .
the baby was weighting 414 g , and the clinical manifestations were morphologically normal .
four days after birth the baby died of pulmonary hemorrhage .
placental infarction was pathologically found .
her laboratory examinations showed liver dysfunction , and the data from coagulation studies indicated the diagnostic criteria for dic .
intravascular infusion of nafamostat methylate together with antibiotics , gamma - globulin 15 g , and platelet transfusion gradually improved the clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities .
the patient had no fever or persistent epigastralgia .
her blood pressure was 140 / 92 mmhg and pulse was 118 per min under antihypertensive therapy .
her renal biopsy showed lupus nephritis ins / rps class iv with mesangial interposition , massive subendothelial , subepithelial and mesangial deposit , fibrinoid necrosis , karyorrhexis , swelling of endothelial cells , and foam cells .
the patient was diagnosed maps .
then multitarget therapy ( prednisolone , cyclosporine , and mizoribine ) was started .
presently , the patient is now being treated as an outpatient who is asymptomatic , while continuing treatment with cyclosporine a ( 75 mg / day ) , mizoribine ( 100 mg / day ) , and prednisolone ( 25 mg / day ) .
anticoagulation with warfarin ( 2 mg / day ) was started to a target international normalized ratio ( inr ) of 2 - 3 .
3. discussion maps have been reported as encompassing several conditions mainly affecting the microvasculature of selected organs : the liver in hellp syndrome , kidney , brain and skin in ttp and dic .
the present case had hellp syndrome , renal dysfunction , and dic .
several lines of evidence suggest that maps may be triggered , by mainly infections , trauma , surgery , anticoagulation withdrawal , malignancies , or lupus flare , or infrequently appear during pregnancy or puerperium [ 9 , 10 ] .
pauzner et al. reported the relationship between liver infarction in hellp syndrome and aps and indicated that hepatic infarction during pregnancy was almost always associated with aps [ 4 ] .
electronic microscope findings of her renal biopsy demonstrated evidence of microangiopathic , although we could not find liver infarction in the present case .
the term thrombotic microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia ( tmha ) was originally introduced in 1952 [ 11 ] .
tmha encompasses ttp and hemolytic - uremic syndrome ( hus ) .
espinosa et al. reviewed the association of apl and tmha comprehensively [ 12 ] .
simultaneous with the tmha and apl story came the association of patients with hellp syndrome and apl [ 13 ] .
however , in the hellp syndrome , hepatic infarctions are not uncommonly documented and are undoubtedly due to small vessel perturbation [ 13 ] .
in our present case of maps with the hellp syndrome , there were virtually no large vessel occlusions .
the aps has the multifactorial pathogenesis though the criteria include arterial , venous , or small vessel thrombosis [ 1 ] .
the first major player in maps might be the endothelial cells .
endothelial cell activation has been demonstrated in ttp , apl and hellp syndrome [ 14 - 17 ] .
the pathogenicity of some apl has been dramatically demonstrated in animal models [ 14 ] .
the many complex pathways were involved in intracellular signaling resulting in the conversion of cells , particularly endothelial , to a prothrombotic state [ 15 , 16 ] .
the influence of these antibodies on monocytes [ 18 ] , as well as on platelets antibodies is now also well described [ 19 ] .
the apl , are known to be heterogeneous in function and specificity and that more than one type may be present in any individual with aps .
it is clear that aps is a multiorgan - multisystem disease with multiple possible clinical manifestations .
the aspirin and heparin combined therapy is effective in 70 - 80 % of recurrent fetal loss patients with aps [ 20 ] .
our present case was treated with danaparoid instead of heparin to avoid osteoporosis because the patient experienced osteonecrosis of femoral head .
magnani hn reported an analysis of clinical outcomes of 91 pregnancies treated with danaparoid in 83 women with a history of thrombophilia and / or repeated pregnancy loss [ 21 ] .
the successful birth rate and adverse event profile indicated that danaparoid can be an effective and safe alternative antithrombotic in pregnancies complicated by intolerance or resistance to low molecular - weight heparins .
among hellp cases diagnosed antepartum , 90 % are in the third trimester , and the syndrome rarely occurs before 27 weeks of gestation [ 6 ] .
early onset of hellp syndrome and severe organ dysfunction are the characteristics of the treatment failure of obstetrical aps .
target therapy not for thrombosis but for microangiopathy is needed for patients with aps against anticoagulant therapy .

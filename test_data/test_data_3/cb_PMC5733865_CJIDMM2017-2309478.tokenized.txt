the development of effective innate and subsequent adaptive host immune responses is highly dependent on the production of proinflammatory cytokines that increase the activity of immune cells .
the key role in this process is played by inflammasomes , multimeric protein complexes serving as a platform for caspase - 1 , an enzyme responsible for proteolytic cleavage of il - 1beta and il - 18 precursors .
inflammasome activation , which triggers the multifaceted activity of these two proinflammatory cytokines , is a prerequisite for developing an efficient inflammatory response against pathogenic mycobacterium tuberculosis ( m.tb ) .
this review focuses on the role of nlrp3 and aim2 inflammasomes in m.tb - driven immunity .
national science centre2015 / 19 / n / nz6 / 013852016 / 21 / b / nz7 / 01771 1 .
introduction mycobacterium tuberculosis ( m.tb ) , the causative agent of tuberculosis ( tb ) , is a facultative intracellular bacterium that can survive and replicate within host macrophages [ 1 , 2 ]. by avoiding critical components of macrophage - killing repertoire such as phagosome - lysosome fusion , phagosome acidification , activity of lysosomal enzymes or reactive oxygen , and nitrogen intermediates , m.tb evades killing and eradication [ 3 ] .
in addition to phagocytic activity and ability to present antigens to t - cells , macrophages are key cells that regulate the antimycobacterial immune response via secreted cytokines .
the functional capacity of macrophages in fighting infection depends on the degree of their activation .
inactive macrophages have limited ability to inhibit the growth of ingested mycobacteria , thereby serving as a safe life niche .
after activation by interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) that is secreted by t - cells , macrophages acquire enhanced bactericidal strength enabling them to kill mycobacteria growing intracellularly [ 4 ] .
the ifn - gamma - driven antimicrobial properties of phagocytes are augmented by il - 18 and il - 1beta , two proinflammatory cytokines processed by caspase - 1 that are recruited to the inflammasomes , multiprotein platforms composed inter alia of intracellular sensors for pathogen - or host - derived molecules .
il - 18 , belonging to the il - 1 family , is produced by a wide range of immune and nonimmune cells [ 5 - 7 ] .
the il - 18 precursor ( pro - il - 18 ) is converted by caspase - 1 into an active molecule , which forms a signaling complex with il - 18r [ 8 , 9 ] .
the receptor is composed of two chains : alpha ( il - 18ra ) and beta ( il - 18rb ) .
il - 18rb is a signal transduction chain , essential for the formation of a high affinity complex and cell activation .
the primary role of il - 18 is to induce ifn - gamma production in cooperation with il - 12 or il - 15 , although immunological effects exerted by il - 18 are dependent on the cytokine microenvironment .
il - 18 is able to polarize t lymphocyte response towards th1 , induce t - cell proliferation , activate nk cells , enhance cd8 (+) t cytolytic activity , and augment , apart from ifn - gamma , the production of varied cytokines including tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) , interleukin - ( il - ) 4 , il - 5 , il - 13 , il - 17 , and granulocyte - macrophage colony stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) [ 8 , 10 , 11 ] .
thus , the multifaceted activity of il - 18 seems to play a prominent role in host defense against both extracellular and intracellular pathogens , including m.tb. however , an excessive il - 18 response might contribute to the induction of pathomechanisms leading to the damage of cells and tissues [ 12 , 13 ] .
therefore , the proinflammatory activity of il - 18 is balanced by a constitutively secreted il - 18 binding protein ( il - 18bp ) , whose binding to il - 18 decreases the production of ifn - gamma and other cytokines , thereby reducing the risk of immunopathology [ 14 ] .
the other inflammasome - dependent cytokine , il - 1beta , which is mainly produced by monocytes and macrophages , plays an important role in inflammation and host immune response by affecting the function of various cells , either alone or in combination with other cytokines [ 15 - 17 ] .
the activity of il - 1beta is tightly regulated at the levels of its transcription and release .
the production of il - 1beta is regulated by several proteins including pyrin , pi - 9 ( the caspase - 1 inhibitor proteinase inhibitor 9 ) , and some card - containing proteins , which interfere with the recruitment of caspase - 1 or directly neutralize its activity [ 18 ] .
the effects of il - 1beta are exerted via binding specific cell surface receptors - - il - 1ri and il - 1rii [ 19 ] .
as in the mature il - 18 form , active il - 1beta is created after the proteolytic cleavage of its precursor by inflammasome - dependent caspase - 1 .
mature il - 1beta plays important homeostatic functions in organisms and is implicated in the initiation of antimicrobial immunity via the induction of tnf - alpha and il - 6 release and polarization of th17 response , which improve protective mucosal host defense by the secretion of il - 17 and il - 22 [ 20 , 21 ] .
the proinflammatory role of il - 1beta in the resistance against m.tb has been confirmed by the observation that il - 1beta or il - 1r knockout mice were found to be more susceptible to tb showing high mortality and increased bacterial burden in the lungs [ 22 ] .
additionally , double - deficient il - 1alpha / beta mice had significantly larger granulomas , and their alveolar macrophages produced less nitric oxide than the cells from wild - type animals [ 23 ] .
2. inflammasomes - - mediators of inflammation inflammation is an evolutionarily conserved protective response to noxious stimuli mounted by the innate immune system of the host .
immune deficiencies leading to insufficient development of inflammation processes may result in severe and recurrent infections , although overly intense activation of the inflammation cascade may be a cause of chronic systemic inflammatory disorders [ 24 , 25 ] .
the development of innate immunity starts from the recognition of conservative antigenic structures called damps ( danger - associated molecular patterns ) and pamps ( pathogen - associated molecular patterns ) by pattern recognition receptors ( prrs ) presented on the surface of first - line defense immune cells - - macrophages and neutrophils .
activation of these receptors triggers a cascade of signals that results in the induction of multiple proinflammatory cytokines .
the final step of the activation is the production of oxygen and nitrogen radicals , essential elements of the intracellular killing system .
the secretion of these radicals is under strict control of a variety of monocyte / macrophage - derived cytokines such as il - 1beta and il - 18 .
the key role in this process is played by structures called inflammasomes , multimeric protein complexes that control many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. through their cooperation with prrs , inflammasomes activate host defense pathways resulting in clearance of various viral and bacterial infections , including those caused by mycobacteria .
they function as an activating scaffold for inflammatory caspases that play an essential role in the maturation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines as well as in pyroptosis , an inflammatory death of infected cells [ 26 , 27 ] .
caspases are produced as inactive proenzymes that dimerize and undergo cleavage to form active molecules .
assembly into dimers , facilitated by various adaptor proteins binding to specific regions of their precursor forms - - procaspases , is achieved through inflammasome formation [ 28 ] .
activated inflammatory caspases , typically caspase - 1 , lead to the generation of active il - 1beta , il - 18 , and il - 33 from their proprotein precursors .
the mature cytokines are engaged in the recruitment of immune cells to the sites of infection and enhancement of the host 's defensive responses against invading pathogens [ 26 ] .
the inflammasomes are activated by multiple recognition receptors , which determine their structure and function .
the canonical inflammasome sensors are nucleotide - binding domain - like ( nlr ) proteins and absent in melanoma 2 - like ( alr ) proteins and pyrin .
all of them have the ability to assemble inflammasomes and activate the inflammatory caspase - 1 .
the nlr family contains the nlrps ( or nalps ) and the ipaf ( ice - protease - activating factor ) subfamilies [ 29 , 30 ] .
each nlr molecule ( nlrp1 , nlrp3 , nlrp6 , nlrp7 , nlrp12 , or naip / nlrc4 ) recognizes specific ligands that activate the assembly of the inflammasome .
nlr proteins consist of the conserved nucleotide - binding and oligomerization domain ( nacht or nod ) , an n - terminal caspase recruitment domain ( card ) or pyrin domain ( pyd ) or baculovirus inhibitor repeat - ( bir - ) like domain , and c - terminal leucine rich repeats ( lrrs ) [ 26 , 31 - 35 ] .
lrrs are responsible for the recognition of pamps , while the nacht domain activates proinflammatory cytokine pathways via atp - dependent oligomerization [ 26 , 29 ] .
the nlrp1 inflammasome has a card that activates caspase - 1 [ 36 , 37 ] , and therefore the recruitment of asc is not required to interact directly with procaspase - 1 .
however , it has been shown that the participation of asc in the process enhanced the activation of the enzyme .
in contrast , nlrp3 contains no typical card domain that contributes to the activation of caspase - 1 through the interaction of the pyd domain of nlrp3 with asc [ 25 ] .
compared with nlrp1 and nlrp3 , the ipaf protein does not contain a pyd but instead has a card that interacts directly with procaspase - 1 without the need for asc [ 38 ] .
the members of the alr group ( known as the pyhin family ) are characterized by the presence of the pyrin domain ( pyd ) and one or two hematopoietic ifn - inducible nuclear antigens with 200 amino acid repeat ( hin - 200 ) domains [ 26 ] .
the pyd recruits proteins for the formation of inflammasomes , while the hin domain recognizes and binds to dna that can be found in the cytosol [ 26 ] .
the best - known alrs , absent in melanoma 2 ( aim2 ) and ifn - gamma inducible protein 16 ( ifi16 ) , function as intracellular immune sensors that detect microbial dna .
the pyhin proteins differ in their localization in the cell compartments ; aim2 can be found in the cytosol , whereas ifi16 is usually localized in the nucleus [ 39 ] .
pyrin , another canonical inflammasome - activating protein , is composed of an n - terminal pyd followed by two central b - box zinc finger and coiled - coil domains and in humans , a c - terminal b30.2 / rfp / spry domain [ 40 ] .
pyrin associates through a pyd - pyd interaction with asc protein , leading to its oligomerization that results in caspase - 1 activation and interleukin - 1beta processing [ 40 ] .
the activation of the pyrin inflammasome is induced by the inactivation of rhoa gtpase by bacterial toxins [ 26 , 41 ] .
the process of activation has been detected in both mice and humans , suggesting that the b30.2 / rfp / spry domain is not necessary for its initiation .
3. inflammasomes in mycobacterium tuberculosis infection the inflammasomes have been found to play important roles in host immunity against mycobacteria since it has been found that mice deficient in il - 18 , il - 1beta , or il - 1 receptor type i ( il - 1r1 ) are more susceptible to m.tb infection [ 42 - 46 ] .
two inflammasomes , containing nlrp3 and aim2 molecules as sensor proteins , were found to play a crucial role in m.tb - induced immunity ( figure 1 ) [ 20 , 47 , 48 ] .
the nlrp3 - containing inflammasome can be activated by a wide group of stimuli including whole mycobacterial cells , as well as viruses , fungi , environmental chemical irritants , and host - derived molecules such as extracellular atp , fibrillar amyloid - beta peptide , and hyaluronan [ 22 , 49 - 53 ] .
the nlrp3 inflammasome - activated responses result in the release of significant amounts of caspase - 1 , which leads to maturation and secretion of il - 1beta and il - 18 and activation of pyroptosis [ 26 ] .
the process of nlrp3 activation is triggered by at least two signals : ( 1 ) a priming signal eliciting the expression of nlrp3 , pro - il - 1beta , and pro - il - 18 genes after tlr stimulation and ( 2 ) an activation signal leading to the autocatalytic activation of procaspase - 1 and proteolytic cleavage of pro - il - 1beta and pro - il - 18 .
in most cell types , nlrp3 priming is a prerequisite for deubiquitination and assembly of the nlrp3 inflammasome .
relocalization of nlrp3 to the mitochondria is followed by the secretion of mitochondrial factors into the cytosol , potassium efflux through membrane ion channels , and release of cathepsin resulting in destabilization of lysosomal membranes .
apoptosis - associated speck - like protein ( asc ) plays an important role in the formation of an effective inflammasome .
asc recruits procaspase - 1 through its c - terminal caspase recruitment domain ( card ) and interacts with nlrp3 via its pyrin domain ( pyd ) , serving as a bridge between these two molecules .
the autocatalysis of procaspase - 1 results in its cleavage and transformation into active caspase - 1 , which in turn cleaves the precursors of two proinflammatory cytokines , il - 1beta and il - 18 , leading to their secretion into the cytoplasm or induction [ 24 , 25 , 48 , 54 , 55 ] .
however , the mechanism of triggering the nlrp3 inflammasome complex activation cascade is still a subject of debate , and at least three models for the process have been proposed .
the first suggestion is that the activation mechanism is associated with an efflux of potassium ions out of the cell and a reduction in their intracellular concentration .
such a model of activation occurs in monocytes / macrophages after stimulation with numerous stimuli including atp , nigericin , bacterial cells , or their components [ 56 , 57 ] .
recently , nek7 protein , a member of the family of nima - related kinases ( nek proteins ) , has been identified as an nlrp3 - binding protein that acts downstream of potassium efflux to regulate nlrp3 assembly and activation [ 58 ] .
he et al. demonstrated that in the absence of nek7 , caspase - 1 activation and il - 1beta release were abrogated in response to signals that activate nlrp3 [ 58 ] .
according to the second suggested mechanism , inflammasome activation is a result of lysosomal membrane damage and release of the phagosome content into cytosol [ 22 , 59 ] .
the third and most accepted model assumes that the induction of the nlrp3 inflammasome complex is caused by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 60 - 63 ] .
the common final step in all of these models is the release of cathepsins into the cytosol leading to the lysosomal destabilization and conversion of procaspase - 1 into a biologically active caspase - 1 form .
it should also be mentioned that formation of the nlrp3 inflammasome and cytokine release occur independently of transcriptional upregulation [ 64 ] .
juliana et al. showed that tlr4 signaling through myd88 nontranscriptionally primed the nlrp3 inflammasome by its deubiquitination .
the mechanism was dependent on mitochondria - derived reactive oxygen species and was involved in the secretion of cytokines , such as il - 18 , and other inflammatory mediators such as high - mobility group protein 1 ( hmgb1 ) [ 64 , 65 ] .
the aim2 ( absent in melanoma 2 ) receptor , possessing a c - terminal hin - 200 domain and an n - terminal pyrin domain ( pyd ) , triggers aim2 inflammasome activation , inflammatory cell death ( pyroptosis ) , and release of il - 1beta and il - 18 in response to cytosolic double - stranded ( ds ) dna [ 66 , 67 ] .
studies of gene - targeted aim2 - deficient mice have shown that aim2 inflammasomes play a role in host defense against viruses and intracellular bacterial pathogens such as listeriae and mycobacteria [ 68 - 70 ] .
aim2 inflammasomes can be activated by dna sequences having at least 80 base pairs in length in a sequence - independent manner [ 71 , 72 ] .
the hin - 200 and pyd domains take part in forming a complex , which is maintained in an inactive state during homeostasis [ 71 , 73 ] .
binding of dsdna to hin - 200 facilitates oligomerization of aim2 , and the resulting conformational change exposes the n - terminal pyd to allow the recruitment of the adaptor protein asc .
the card of asc binds the card of procaspase - 1 , that forms an active aim2 platform .
upon autoactivation , caspase - 1 directs maturation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines [ 48 , 55 , 66 , 68 , 74 ] .
the latest data suggest that nlrp3 - or asc - deficient animals are characterized by impaired inflammasome formation and increased susceptibility to tb [ 20 , 54 , 68 , 75 , 76 ] .
however , nlrp3 - / - and asc - / - mice produced il - 18 and il - 1beta levels comparable to those of wild - type mice , which suggests the involvement of inflammasome - independent pathways in the secretion of these cytokines [ 21 , 42 , 47 ] .
many reports have demonstrated that a wide range of microorganisms are able to inhibit inflammasome activation and function .
viruses and many bacterial pathogens develop several mechanisms of repression of inflammasome folding ; however , not all mechanisms are clearly understood .
yersinia enterocolitica produce yope and yopt proteins that supress caspase - 1 maturation , whereas yopk protein of y. pseudotuberculosis binds to the type iii secretion system , thereby preventing the recognition of the pathogen by host cell inflammasome .
pseudomonas aeruginosa mediates suppression of nlrc4 - inflammasome by secreting exou and exos effectors , whose mechanism of action still needs elucidation .
virulent m.tb can inhibit the formation of aim2 and nlrp3 inflammasomes both directly and indirectly , but the factors responsible for the inhibition have not been recognized thus far .
one of the likely mechanisms is the activity of zn - metalloprotease called zmp1 , which inhibits the activation of nlrp3 inflammasome and , as a consequence , leads to the reduction of caspase - 1 activity [ 77 - 79 ] .
master et al. showed that infection of mice macrophages with zmp1 - deleted m.tb induces activation of the inflammasome , resulting in enhanced maturation of phagosomes , increased il - 1beta secretion , and better m.tb clearance in lungs [ 79 ] .
it is probable that m.tb is able to restrain the activation of other inflammasome types , but evidence is needed to confirm this hypothesis .
in addition to the induction of inflammasome activation via prrs , m.tb antigens can modulate other innate immunity - associated functions .
one recently identified protein , tyrosine phosphatase ( ptp ) a , enters the nucleus of the host cells and regulates the transcription of many host genes involved in the mechanisms of innate immunity , cell proliferation , and migration [ 80 ] .
the enzyme is also able to dephosphorylate certain host proteins ( p - jnk , p - p38 , and p - vps33b ) , leading to inhibition of phagosome - lysosome fusion and blocking the acidification of phagosomes .
both activities are crucial for m.tb virulence in vivo through the promotion of m.tb's intracellular survival in macrophages [ 80 ] .
m.tb often escapes from the phagosome within a few days of the invasion of the host organism and creates difficulties in assessing the potential role of inflammasomes during the initial stages of mycobacterial infection .
moreover , the evaluation of il - 1beta and il - 18 produced as a result of inflammasome activation is inadequate in revealing the significance of formed multiprotein platforms in the course of developing infection .
the initiation of phagocytosis causes a decrease in the levels of potassium ions in macrophages , which have been found to be one of the crucial inflammasome activators during infections with m.tb and nontuberculous mycobacteria [ 81 ] .
other regulators such as thioredoxin - interacting proteins , activated by the increase in reactive oxygen species in cytosol , are thought to have minor effect on the formation of inflammasomes in m.tb infection [ 47 ] .
the signaling cascade can also be activated by the mycobacterial type vii secretion system ( esx - 1 ) , which is responsible for translocation of extracellular dna ( edna ) in cytosol and the production of ifn - beta .
many studies have demonstrated that , at the molecular level , ifn - beta regulates the aim2 inflammasome activity [ 82 , 83 ] .
some esx - 1 - deficient m. smegmatis mutants have been shown to possess limited capacity for aim2 inflammasome activation .
however , in contrast to nontuberculous mycobacteria ( ntm ) , m.tb mutants lacking esx - 1 system failed to inhibit aim2 formation , while the wild - type strain inhibited the inflammasome activation [ 47 , 84 ] .
the suggested mechanism of inhibition involves the ifn - beta - mediated induction of il - 10 , which in turn suppresses il - 1beta production [ 85 , 86 ] .
however , further investigation is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of m.tb - driven aim2 inhibition and its consequences for bacterial virulence. m. bovis bcg vaccine strain , which does not possess the esx - 1 system , poorly activates multiple nlr and inflammasome complex components including caspase - 1 [ 87 ] .
the bacilli repress the expression of thioredoxin - interacting protein ( txnip ) , an antioxidant inhibitor recruiting caspase - 1 to the nlrp3 inflammasome .
the inhibition of txnip by bcg limits nlrp3 activation and restrains pyroptosis following mycobacterial infection .
proinflammatory responses to bcg bacilli was found to be driven primarily through toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , since bcg does not activate expression of genes downstream of tlr / myd88 - and nod - 2 - driven nf - kappabeta and ap - 1 pathways .
however , bcg is still able to induce moderate il - 1beta secretion as measured by transcription of inflammasome network genes [ 87 , 88 ] .
understanding bcg - induced pathways of inflammasome activation can be helpful in improving the existing vaccine or developing new antituberculous vaccines .
the recombinant bcg deltaurec : : hly vaccine candidate ( vpm1002 ) has been shown to induce improved protection against tb over the parental bcg strain [ 4 ] .
saiga et al. demonstrated that vpm1002 activated the aim2 inflammasome and caspase - 1 through the ability of listeriolysin to perforate phagosome membranes , which is encoded by the hly gene integrated into bcg genome [ 4 ] .
the perforation facilitates the release of mycobacterial dna into the cytosol , in a way that is similar to the esx - 1 system of m.tb. mice vaccinated with vpm1002 showed increased production of il - 1beta and il - 18 as well as induction of the stimulator of ifn genes ( sting ) - dependent autophagy , which promotes delivery of bcg antigens to mhc molecules and improves their presentation to t - cells [ 4 ] .
apart from direct induction of proinflammatory cytokine secretion , the activated caspase - 1 triggers the pyroptotic death of infected cells .
the cytosolic protein gasdermin d ( gsdms ) is a key mediator of this process .
the cleavage of gsdmd by activated caspase - 1 results in the release of its n - terminal fragment ( gsdmd - nt ) , which forms pores in the plasma membrane of the infected cell leading to the elimination of the pathogen [ 26 , 89 - 91 ] .
the pores disrupt cell membrane integrity allowing water influx , cell swelling , and osmotic lysis together with an efflux of small molecules , including proinflammatory cytokines .
gsdmd - nt is able to kill both cell - free and intracellular microorganisms and can be thought as a new antibacterial agent .
however , it is still not known whether gsdmd - nt is able to permeabilize the membrane of the phagosomes and kill the bacteria hidden within these organelles .
so far , there is no evidence of such a function .
it is probable that the inhibition of bacterial growth is mediated by other caspase components .
using single - cell analysis , thurston et al. demonstrated that the replication of cytosolic salmonella typhimurium was inhibited independently or prior to the onset of cell death , suggesting that caspase - 1 and caspase - 11 might have additional functions in the elimination of cytosolic bacteria [ 92 ] .
4. therapeutics targeting inflammasome pathways biologic agents interfering with inflammasome activation may provide new means of therapeutical interventions for many diseases .
these agents may target either upstream processes of inflammasome regulation or downstream il - 1 signaling [ 41 ] .
inappropriate activity of inflammasomes has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of certain autoinflammatory skin disorders such as cryopyrin - associated periodic syndrome ( caps ) or familial mediterranean fever ( fmf ) as well as a number of chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis , gouty arthritis ( gout ) , atherosclerosis , type 2 diabetes , and obesity [ 29 , 93 , 94 ] .
moreover , mechanisms controlling the nlrp3 inflammasome arrangement have also been implicated in the development of lung , kidney , and liver diseases [ 95 - 97 ] .
colchicine , a drug used for treatment of gout , has been shown to inhibit macrophage nlrp3 inflammasome assembly and activation in vitro and in vivo [ 98 ] .
colchicine blocks monosodium urate crystal - induced nlrp3 inflammasome - driven caspase - 1 activation and il - 1beta processing and release , suppresses the expression of genes involved in cell regulation , and inhibits il - 1 - induced l - selectin expression on neutrophils [ 99 ] .
other therapeutics that target inflammasome - driven end products include vx - 765 ( inhibitor of caspase - 1 activation ) , anakinra ( recombinant form of il - 1 receptor antagonist ) , canakinumab ( monoclonal antibody against il - 1beta ) , rilonacept ( il - 1 inhibitor ) , il - 18 binding protein , and anti - il - 18 receptors antibodies [ 8 , 41 , 100 ] .
a number of new molecules have been identified as inhibitors of il - 1beta processing ( glyburide , parthenolide , crid3 , auranofin , isoliquiritigenin , beta - hydroxybutyrate , and mcc950 ) ; however , confirming their clinical utility will require additional time and research [ 24 ] .
5. conclusion inflammasomes have been implicated as specialized signaling platforms critical for the regulation of both innate immunity and inflammation .
m.tb has been shown to modulate the host innate immune response by delaying cell death systems of the host , thereby facilitating its own proliferation .
understanding the molecular mechanisms of inflammasome activation during intracellular pathogen infections such as with m.tb , and the evasive mechanisms employed by this evading pathogen , may lead to development of more potent therapies to combat the proliferation of m.tb. acknowledgments this work was supported by the national science centre grant nos .

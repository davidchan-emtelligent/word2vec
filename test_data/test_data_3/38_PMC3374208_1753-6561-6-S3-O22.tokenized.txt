we now appreciate that this pathway becomes deregulated in many human cancers and has an important role in the control of metabolism and aging .
we have identified two distinct mtor - containing proteins complexes , one of which regulates growth through s6k and another that regulates cell survival through akt .
these complexes , mtorc1 and mtorc2 , define both rapamycin - sensitive and insensitive branches of the mtor pathway .
i will discuss new results from our lab on the regulation and functions of the mtorc1 and mtorc2 pathways .

objective to identify the socio demographic , life style and foot examination related predictors of diabetic foot and leg ulcers with a view to develop a screening tool appropriate for the use in an outpatient setting .
research design and methods this cross sectional study included type 2 diabetes mellitus ( dm ) patients ; 88 subjects with leg and foot ulcers and 80 non ulcer controls .
socio demographic data and life style factors were documented .
foot was examined for skin changes and structural abnormalities .
distal peripheral neuropathy was assessed by pressure sense , vibration sense and joint position sense .
multivariate analysis by logistic regression was used to determine the significant predictors in screening for foot ulcers .
results education of grade 6 and below ( or - 1.41 , 95 % ci ; 1.03 - 4.68 ) , low income ( or - 23.3 , 95 % ci ; 1.5 - 34.0 ) , impaired vibration sense ( or - 24.79 , 95 % ci ; 9.3 - 66.2 ) , abnormal monofilament test on first ( or - 1.69 , 95 % ci ; 1.36 - 16.6 ) , third ( or - 3.4 , 95 % ci ; 1.1 - 10.6 ) and fifth ( or - 1.8 , 95 % ci ; 1.61 - 12.6 ) toes are found to be predictors of increased risk whereas incidental diagnosis of dm ( or - 0.03 , 95 % ci ; 0.003 - 0.28 ) , wearing covered shoes ( or - 0.003 , 95 % ci ; 0.00 - 0.28 ) , presence of normal skin color ( or - 0.01 , 95 % ci ; 0.001 - 0.14 ) and normal monofilament test on first metatarsal head ( or - 0.10 , 95 % ci ; 0.00 - 0.67 ) are protective factors for ulcers .
conclusions ten independent risk and protective factors identified in this study are proposed as a simple screening tool to predict the risk of developing leg and foot ulcers in patients with dm. the study was funded by the university of sri jayewardenepura - grant number asp / 06 / re / med / 2012 / 35 .

introduction diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , especially if uncontrolled , eventually leads to chronic complications with a significant proportion of patients having some complication even at the time of diagnosis [ 1 ] .
among the complications , diabetic ulcer disease has gained importance because of the socioeconomic burden it imposes on the patient , the patient 's family and on the health care system of the country .
in uk and usa the prevalence of foot ulceration due to diabetes has found to be 5 - 7 % [ 2 ]) and 6 % [ 3 ] respectively , whereas in the developing countries it has shown a higher percentage [ 4,5 ] .
in sri lanka , one third of type 2 diabetes patients have a risk of foot ulceration with some progressing to limb amputations [ 6 ] .
distal peripheral neuropathy ( dpn ) is reported to be an important cause of diabetic ulcer disease [ 7,8 ] .
although obesity , presence of hypertension , high serum cholesterol and alcohol consumption were identified as predictors of dpn in the developed region , in a national study including all provinces of sri lanka , these factor were not identified as predictors [ 9 ] .
in this , which studied 528 subjects , rural residence and low household monthly income (< sri lankan rupees ( lkr ) 12,000 ) revealed an association with dpn implying that the risk factors for foot ulcers in the developed world might be different to the asian and south asian region .
in the south asian region , poverty and poor educational level [ 8 ] contribute directly or indirectly to every health hazard .
it may be that factors like inappropriate foot wear , duration of diabetes and poor glyceamic control might be more important in this region .
the american diabetes association in its position statement - 2008 [ 10 ] recommends peripheral neuropathy screening at diagnosis of diabetes and at least annually thereafter , using simple clinical tests .
although dpn screening is a widely researched area , the findings show significant variation .
some authors have shown the effectiveness of single tests - assessment of the vibration sense [ 11 ] , vibration perception threshold [ 12 ] and the pressure sensation using the 5.7 / 10g semmes - weinstein ( sw ) monofilament test [ 13 ] , while others have shown the effectiveness of them when used in combination [ 14,15 ] .
sw monofilament test is shown to be a simple , valid clinical tool for detecting neuropathy but requires a consensus on the protocol to be used [ 16 ] as the number of sites tested by monofilament vary widely between one site [ 15 ] up to ten [ 17,18 ] .
however , none of these studies have shown these as predictors of foot ulcers , as diabetic ulcer disease seems to have a complicated aetiology , to which a number of structural , pathophysiological , behavioral and environmental factors contribute [ 19 ] .
longer duration of diabetes and poor level of education [ 8 ] , prolonged hyperglycemia [ 20 ] , inappropriate footwear [ 21 ] , walking barefoot [ 22 ] , weak pedal pulses [ 23 ] , skin changes of the foot [ 21 ] , presence of callus [ 24 ] , charcot deformity [ 25 ] and reduced ankle mobility [ 26 ] are some of the other common factors documented .
due to devastating impact diabetic ulcers pose on the quality of life of the patients and the health care costs of a country , it is crucial to identify the at risk group for occurrence of ulcers , give them appropriate health education and monitor them closely with a view to prevent ulcer formation .
therefore , the aim of this study is to identify the socio demographic , life style and foot examination related predictors with a view to develop a simple and cost effective screening tool which is appropriate to be practiced in the outpatient settings .
urgency of this task becomes imperative with the increasing prevalence of dm globally .
materials and methods ethics statement this study was approved by the ethics review committees of university of sri jayewardenepura and colombo south teaching hospital ( csth ) .
data were collected from type 2 dm subjects attending the out patient department of the csth , sri lanka .
eighty eight subjects with leg and foot ulcers and 80 non ulcer controls were studied .
previously diagnosed dm subjects were identified and the diagnosis was confirmed by medical records .
subjects consenting to the study were recruited on a consecutive basis .
the nature of the study was explained to the subjects prior to obtaining written informed consent .
subjects with leg and foot ulcers with an ulcer size not less than 2.5 cm2 , wagner scale two ( scale 2 = ulcers extending into tendon , bone , or capsule ) or three ( scale 3 = deep ulcer with osteomyelitis , or abscess leg or foot ulcers ) and ulcer duration more than one week and less than six months were included in the study group .
subjects with cognitive impairment were excluded from both the study and control groups .
data on socio demographic factors ( sex , age , education , household income ) and diabetic and life style factors ( duration of dm , mode of diagnosis , type of treatment , family history of dm , smoking , alcohol and type of footwear ) were collected by an interviewer administered questionnaire .
physical examination of the lower limb was performed .
foot was examined for skin changes ( dry / cracked skin , skin discoloration and callus ) , and structural abnormalities ( hammer toes , bunions and flat foot ) .
neuropathy assessment presence of dpn was assessed by testing the pressure sense , vibration sense and joint position sense .
all tests were demonstrated to the subjects prior to the assessment of sensory modalities and they were performed while the subjects closed their eyes .
vibration sense was assessed by applying a 128 - hz vibrated tuning fork over the halluces .
subjects were asked to say ' yes' every time they perceived vibrations .
if the subject was unable to perceive vibration sense while the examiner still perceives it , the test was recorded as abnormal .
test was repeated three times .
if the subject did not indicate the result correctly for 2 or more times the test was reported as impaired .
position sense was assessed by moving the great toe for 10degrees at inter phalangeal joint .
test was performed by flexing the great toe dorsally and ventrally while lightly grasping either sides with the thumb and the index finger of the investigator .
subjects were asked to indicate the position of the great toe as ' up ' or ' down ' .
if the subject was unable to indicate the direction of the great toe correctly , the test was recorded as abnormal .
test was repeated three times .
if the test was abnormal for 2 or more times , it was reported as impaired .
pressure sensation was assessed by applying the sw monofilament at ten sites ( 9 sites on the plantar surface of the foot ; first toe , third toe , fifth toe , first metatarsal head , third metatarsal head , fifth metatarsal head , medial mid foot , lateral mid foot and heel , and 1 site on the dorsal surface between the base of the first and the second toe ) .
monofilament was pressed perpendicularly to the test site till it buckled and the pressure was exerted for two seconds .
subjects were asked to say ' yes' every time they perceive the pressure sensation at each site and test was repeated three times .
at a given site , if the subject did not feel the sensation for 2 or more times the test was reported as abnormal .
the pressure sensation was considered impaired , if the test was abnormal at any one or more sites .
statistical analysis we compared differences of cases and controls using univariate analysis and calculated the odds ratios ( ors ) and 95 % cis for socio demographic factors , diabetes and life style factors and findings of foot examination .
then multivariate analysis by logistic regression was performed to find significant variables for the final model for screening for foot ulcers .
data analysis was performed using statistical package for social sciences ( spss ) software ( version 19 ) .
95 % confidence was used for the determination of significance of probabilities .
results socio demographic , life style and foot examination related factors were compared in subjects with leg and foot ulcers and non - ulcer controls .
in the univariate analysis , male sex , an education level of grade 6 and below , a monthly household income of lkr 50,000 and less were risk factors for foot ulcers in patients with dm ( table 1 ) .
a statistically significant increased risk was also observed for family history of dm and wearing slippers as opposed to sandals and covered shoes , whereas a decreased risk for foot ulcers was observed for diabetes diagnosed incidentally ( or - 0.25 , 95 % ci ; 0.11 - 0.59 ) ( table 2 ) .
no consistent significant trend was observed with either smoking or alcohol .
table 3 shows the outcome of the examination of the foot .
intact vibration sense , position sense and a normal pressure sensation indicated by overall monofilament test results were statistically significant protective factors for foot ulceration .
the presence of pressure sensation at first , third and fifth toes , first , third and fifth metatarsal heads , medial and lateral mid foot and dorsum was a protective factor for foot ulceration .
however , presence of normal monofilament test at heel was not noteworthy .

the objective of the heath care team should extend beyond treating the ulcers , and attempts should be taken to prevent ulcers in diabetic patients .
screening to identify factors which can accurately predict those who are at risk for foot ulceration is practical in an outpatient setting in a low resource country .
since most of these factors are modifiable , identification of these will allow prevention of ulcers in patients with dm. due to the rapid increase in prevalence of dm in sri lanka , the patient turnover at diabetic clinics has substantially increased over the past decade , and thus the detection of these factors should be by a simple , less time consuming tool which is preferebly suitable to be administered even by a paramedical personnel .
male sex was one potential risk factor identified in the univariate analysis and this finding is consistent with studies elsewhere [ 8 ] .
high prevalence of dm in men compared to women [ 27 ] and trauma prone occupations in males especially in low income groups may be contributing to this difference .
although the presence of a family history is a known etiological factor for dm , we did not find it as an independent risk factor for the development of diabetic ulcers .
ten factors were found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of ulcers in patients with diabetes in the multivariate analysis .
subjects with low level of education were found to have a higher risk of developing ulcers possibly due to the less likelihood of seeking treatment and the interest in life style adjustments .
in fact low level of education has been suggested for increasing prevalence of dm in the rural sector of sri lanka [ 28 ] , and dpn in uae [ 8 ] both contributing to foot ulceration .
a family monthly household income of less than lkr 15000 was another factor identified in this study which increases the risk of developing an ulcer ( or : 23.3 ; 95 % ci 1.5 - 34.0 ) .
this finding is supported by a national study showing that dpn is associated with residence in rural areas and with a low household income [ 9 ] suggesting that the extreme poor may be having less opportunity for health services .
although the association of the durations of dm and dpn were reported previously [ 8,29 - 32 ] , our findings are not in agreement probably because the true duration might be much longer than the duration calculated from the time of diagnosis .
however , we found that the diagnosis of dm being incidental as a protective factor against ulcer formation .
we also found that wearing slippers as opposed to sandals and covered shoes increases the risk of foot ulceration about 3 - 4 times .
this is supported by a previous finding suggesting the use of appropriate footwear and wearing them indoors as well as outdoors to prevent foot ulcers [ 22 ] .
in general examination of the foot , skin discoloration was found to be the only significant predictor of foot ulceration in our study population .
plantar callus [ 24 ] and hammer / claw toe deformity [ 25 ] were reported to be strong predictors of foot ulceration in previous studies investigating 63 and 749 dm patients respectively .
however , we did not find any association with these probably due to differences in walking habits of study populations .
although dpn is reported to be the predominant root cause of diabetic foot ulceration , the diagnosis is complicated and requires the assessment of multiple features [ 21 ] .
different symptom scores have being used extensively in previous studies [ 31 - 33 ] .
we did not advocate them because neuropathic sensory symptoms do not always accurately detect dpn in patients with type 2 dm [ 34 ] and sometimes they are subjective and correlate poorly with other tests [ 35 ] .
instead , our aim was to test for three sensory modalities using basic clinical skills and simple equipment with a view to find their suitability in identifying dm patients at risk for foot ulceration .
although impairment of all three sensations appeared to be significant risk factors for ulceration in the univariate analysis , only the impairment of vibration and pressure sensations were significant in the final model .
several previous reports have shown the value of using 128 - hz tuning fork alone [ 11 ] or in combination with 10g sw monofilament test [ 36 ] .
in relation to our findings , impaired vibration sense is a very strong predictor of diabetic ulceration ( or : 24.7 ; 95 % ci 9.3 - 66.2 ) .
the use of sw monofilament test is found to be an ideal , sensitive , easily learned , simple , inexpensive and less time consuming screening tool to assess dpn [ 17,36,37 ] .
although various combination of sites are suggested [ 17,18,37,38 ] , we found that the presence of an abnormal monofilament test on 1st , 3rd,and 5th toes significantly increases the ulcer risk by 1.69,3.4 and 1.8 fold respectively recommending these 3 out of 10 sites to be used in screening .
the finding of a normal monofilament test on the first metatarsal head strengthens the predictive value of the screening tool as it is found be an independent protective factor .
this is in agreement with the suggestion of including 1st metatarsal head as a common site of screening in previous studies [ 18,36 ] .
although nerve conduction studies are the gold standard to detect dpn , they are not cost effective to be used in a low resource country as ours and further , they are impractical in a primary care setting .
in summary , we have identified 10 independent risk and protective factors which can be used in a simple screening tool suitable for screening all dm patients to predict the risk of developing leg and foot ulcers .
however , the possibility that ulceration may have influenced the occurrence of some of the factors identified in the tool is a limitation which has to be resolved by a prospective study .
training the staff to administer the tool is suggested to minimize the inter - observer variability .
although glycaemic control is known to reduce the incidence of dpn , it was not considered due to practical limitations in outpatient settings .
future study is planned to validate this tool for our population .

this article provides a backgrounder on drug allergy and strategies for the diagnosis and management of some of the most common drug - induced allergic reactions , such allergies to penicillin , sulfonamides , cephalosporins , radiocontrast media , local anesthetics , general anesthetics , acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) and non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs .
introduction adverse drug reactions ( adrs ) are defined as any harmful or unintended reaction to a drug that occurs at doses used for prevention , diagnosis , or treatment [ 1 ] .
adrs are common in everyday clinical practice , affecting between 15 - 25 % of patients ; serious reactions occur in 7 - 13 % of patients [ 2,3 ] .
adrs are classified as either predictable reactions that may occur in anyone ( type a ) or unpredictable reactions that occur in only susceptible individuals ( type b ) ( see table 1 ) .
predictable reactions are the most common type of adr and are usually dose dependent and related to the known pharmacologic actions of the drug ( e.g. , side effects , overdose , drug interactions ) .
unpredictable reactions occur in approximately 20 - 25 % of patients who experience adrs ; these reactions are generally unrelated to the pharmacologic actions of the drug [ 1,4,5 ] .
table 1 classification of adverse drug reactions [ 1,4,5 ] type a : predictable type b : unpredictable * drug overdose * secondary drug effects * side effects * drug interactions * drug allergy : an immunologically mediated adr * pseudoallergic ( non - allergic ) : a reaction with the same clinical manifestations as an allergic reaction , but that lacks immunological specificity * drug intolerance : an undesirable pharmacologic effect that occurs at low and sometimes sub - therapeutic doses of the drug that are not caused by underlying abnormalities of metabolism or drug excretion * drug idiosyncrasy : an abnormal / unexpected effect , usually caused by underlying abnormalities of metabolism , excretion , or bioavailability adr : adverse drug reaction drug allergy is one type of unpredictable adr that encompasses a spectrum of immunologically - mediated hypersensitivity reactions with varying mechanisms and clinical presentations [ 1 ] .
it accounts for approximately 5 - 10 % of all adrs [ 6 ] .
pseudoallergic reactions ( also known as non - allergic or non - immune - mediated reactions ) represent another type of unpredictable adr .
these reactions are often indistinguishable from true immunologically mediated allergic reactions , but they lack immunological specificity .
drug allergy not only affects patient quality of life , but may also lead to delayed treatment , use of suboptimal alternate medications , unnecessary investigations and even death .
furthermore , the identification of drug allergy is challenging given the myriad of symptoms and clinical presentations associated with the condition .
therefore , if a drug - induced allergic disorder is suspected , consultation with an allergist experienced in the identification , diagnosis and management of drug allergy is recommended .
this article will provide an overview of the mechanisms and risk factors for drug allergy , as well as strategies for the diagnosis and appropriate management of some of the most common drug - induced allergic disorders .
mechanisms immune - mediated allergic reactions to drugs are classified according to gell and coombs' classification system , which describes the predominant immune mechanisms involved in these reactions .
this classification system includes : immediate - type reactions mediated by immunoglobulin e ( ige ) antibodies ( type i ) , cytotoxic reactions mediated by immunoglobulin g ( igg ) or immunoglobulin m ( igm ) antibodies ( type ii ) , immune - complex reactions ( type iii ) , and delayed - type hypersensitivity reactions mediated by cellular immune mechanisms , such as the recruitment and activation of t cells ( type iv ) [ 7 - 9 ] .
the mechanisms , clinical manifestations , and timing of these immune reactions are summarized in table 2 .

adapted from riedl et al. , 2003.6 unlike immune - mediated drug reactions , pseudoallergic reactions are not associated with the production of antibodies or sensitized t cells , but are often clinically indistinguishable from drug hypersensitivity reactions .
during these reactions , the drug has the ability , via its chemistry or pharmacology , to directly stimulate the release or activation of inflammatory mediators such as histamine ( from mast cells , basophils ) , prostaglandins , leukotrienes , or kinins .
non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , narcotics , and angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitors are common causes of these non - allergic reactions [ 5,10,11 ] .
risk factors factors associated with an increased risk of developing a drug allergy include age , gender , genetic polymorphisms , certain viral infections and drug - related factors ( e.g. , frequency of exposure , route of administration , molecular weight ) ( see table 3 ) .
drug allergy typically occurs in young and middle - aged adults , and is more common in women than men .
genetic polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen ( hla ; a gene product of the major histocompatibility complex ) as well as viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) and the epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) , have also been linked to an increased risk of developing immunologic reactions to drugs .
susceptibility to drug allergy is influenced by genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolism .
in addition , topical , intramuscular , and intravenous routes of administration are more likely to cause allergic drug reactions than oral administration ; while intravenous administration is associated with more severe reactions .
prolonged high doses or frequent doses are more likely to lead to hypersensitivity reactions than a large single dose .
furthermore , large macromolecular drugs ( e.g. , insulin or horse antisera ) or drugs that haptenate ( bind to tissue or blood proteins and elicit an immune response ) , such as penicillin , are also associated with a greater likelihood of causing hypersensitivity reactions .
although atopic patients do not have an increased risk for drug allergy , they are at increased risk for serious allergic reactions [ 4,6,12 - 15 ] .

depending on the history and physical examination results , diagnostic tests such as skin testing , graded challenges and induction of drug tolerance procedures may also be required .
[ 1,4,6,15 ] therefore , if drug allergy is suspected , evaluation by an allergist experienced in these diagnostic procedures is recommended .
history evaluation of the patient with a suspected drug allergy should include a detailed history of all prescription and nonprescription drugs taken by the patient , including dates of administration , drug formulation , dosage and route of administration , clinical symptoms and their timing and duration in relation to drug exposure ; as well as previous drug exposures and reactions [ 1,4,6,15 ] .
clinical presentation in addition to the detailed history , a careful physical examination can help to define possible mechanisms underlying the reaction and guide subsequent investigations and diagnostic testing .

the most common cutaneous manifestation is generalized exanthema ( also known as a maculopapular rash ) , which is characterized by raised , spotted lesions that appears within days to 3 weeks after drug exposure , originate on the trunk , and eventually spread to the limbs .
urticaria ( hives ) and angioedema ( swelling ) are also common , and can results from both ige - mediated and non - ige - mediated mechanisms .
the most severe forms of cutaneous drug reactions are stevens - johnson syndrome ( sjs ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( ten ) .
sjs begins with a maculopapular rash that often progresses to bullae , mucous membrane ulcerations , conjunctivitis , fever , sore throat and fatigue .
ten is a rare condition with similar characteristics to sjs , but it also causes large portions of the epidermis ( the skin 's outermost layer ) to detach from the layers below , leading to extensive skin sloughing and a scalded skin appearance .
given the severity of these conditions , drugs suspected of causing sjs and ten ( most commonly sulfonamides ) should be strictly avoided by the patient in the future [ 1 ] .
although skin reactions are the most common physical manifestation of drug - induced allergic reactions , many other organ systems may be involved , such as the renal , hepatic and hemolytic systems ( see table 4 ) .
multi - organ reactions may also occur and include anaphylaxis ( a serious systemic allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death ; see anaphylaxis article in this supplement ) , drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( dress ) syndrome , serum sickness , drug - induced lupus erythematosus ( dile ) and vasculitis ( a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by inflammatory destruction of blood vessels ) .
dress is a potentially life - threatening condition characterized by a widespread rash , fever , lymphadenopathy ( swollen / enlarged lymph nodes ) and hepatic dysfunction .
serum sickness is an immune - complex reaction that presents with fever , lymphadenopathy , arthralgia , and cutaneous lesions .
the typical symptoms of dile include sudden onset of fever and malaise ; myalgia , arthralgia , and arthritis may also occur several weeks after drug initiation .
in approximately 25 % of cases , the skin may also be affected [ 1,11 ] .
serum sickness and dile are usually self - limited , with symptoms resolving spontaneously within a few weeks after discontinuation of the offending drug .
however , the symptoms of dress may worsen or persist for weeks , or even months , following drug discontinuation [ 1,11 ] .
since the clinical manifestations of drug allergy are highly variable , it is important to exclude other conditions that may mimic drug - induced allergic reactions .
table 5 lists some of the conditions that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of drug allergy .
table 5 conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of drug allergy .

skin testing protocols are standardized for penicillin , and are also useful ( but rarely positive ) for local anesthetics , muscle relaxants , and very sensitive for high - molecular - weight protein substances , such as insulin or monoclonal antibodies .
positive skin tests to these drugs confirm the presence of antigen - specific ige and supports the diagnosis of a type i hypersensitivity reaction .
the negative predictive value of penicillin skin testing is high with appropriate reagents and , therefore , a negative test result is useful for ruling out penicillin allergy. with other agents ( except high molecular weight proteins ) , however , a negative skin test does not effectively rule out the presence of specific ige .
serum - specific ige tests are available for a limited number of drugs .
however , these tests are costly and generally less sensitive than skin tests .
furthermore , most of these in vitro tests are not adequately validated for drug allergy testing [ 1,15 ] .
patch testing involves placing potential allergens ( at non - irritant concentrations ) on the patient 's back for 48 hours under aluminum discs , and then assessing for reactions .
drug patch testing is useful for the diagnosis of various delayed ( type iv ) cutaneous reactions , particularly exanthemata , but is generally not helpful for the diagnosis of sjs or ten [ 1,10,11,15,16 ] .
the measurement of histamine and tryptase levels have proved useful in confirming acute ige - mediated reactions , particularly anaphylaxis ; however , negative results do not rule out acute allergic reactions .
a complete blood count can help diagnose hemolytic ( type ii ) drug - induced reactions , such as hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia , or neutropenia .
hemolytic anemia may also be confirmed with a positive direct and / or indirect coombs' test ( used to examine for the presence of antibodies on red blood cell membranes ) [ 1,11,15 ] .
recent studies have focused on the potential role of the basophil activation test ( the quantification of basophil activation by flow cytometry ) in the diagnosis of drug allergy , since basophils are involved in both immune - mediated and non - immune - mediated reactions .
although some evidence suggests that the test is useful for evaluating possible allergies to beta - lactam antibiotics , nsaids and muscle relaxants , further confirmatory studies are needed before it is widely accepted as a diagnostic tool [ 1,17,18 ] .
in cases where there is a definite medical need for a particular drug , but the clinical diagnosis of drug allergy remains uncertain despite thorough investigations , a procedure to induce temporary drug tolerance ( also referred to as drug desensitization ) or graded challenge testing ( also known as provocation testing ) may be considered .
induction of drug tolerance procedures temporarily modify a patient 's immunologic or non - immunologic response to a drug through the administration of incremental doses of the drug .
most regimens begin with a very dilute concentration of the drug , and the dose is doubled every 15 to 20 minutes , until a full therapeutic dose has been administered after 3 to 8 hours .
drug tolerance is usually maintained only as long as the drug is administered ; the procedure needs to be repeated in the future if the patient requires the drug again after finishing a prior therapeutic course .
unlike induction of drug tolerance procedures , graded challenge tests do not modify a patient 's immunologic or non - immunologic response to a given drug .
these tests are generally used to determine whether a patient will have an adverse reaction to a particular drug by administering sub - therapeutic doses over a period of time , while observing the patient for potential reactions .
they are not advised if the patient has experienced a previous life - threatening reaction to the drug in question .
drug tolerance - induction procedures and graded challenges are potentially harmful and should only be performed by experienced personnel in facilities with resuscitative equipment readily available [ 1,19 ] .
management of common drug allergies the most effective strategy for the management of drug allergy is avoidance or discontinuation of the offending drug .
when available , alternative medications with unrelated chemical structures should be substituted .
cross - reactivity among drugs should be taken into consideration when choosing alternative agents [ 1,11 ] .
additional therapy for drug hypersensitivity reactions is largely supportive and symptomatic .
for example , topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines may improve cutaneous symptoms .
in the event of anaphylaxis , the treatment of choice is epinephrine administered by intramuscular injection into the lateral thigh .
systemic corticosteroids may also be used to treat severe systemic reactions , but should never be given prior to or replace epinephrine in the treatment of anaphylaxis .
severe drug reactions , such as sjs and ten , are best treated in an intensive care or burn unit setting [ 1,11 ] .
strategies for the management of some of the most common drug allergies are discussed below .
penicillin penicillin is the most frequent drug allergy , affecting approximately 10 % of patients .
for patients with penicillin allergy , treatment is best limited to non - penicillin agents .
carbapenems ( e.g. , imipenem ) do not exhibit a significant degree of cross - reactivity with penicillin and may be administered as a graded challenge after prophylactic skin tests with the relevant carbapenem [ 20,21 ] .
monobactams , such as aztreonam , are generally well tolerated by patients with penicillin allergy , except if they had an allergic reaction to ceftazidime [ 22 - 24 ] .
second - or third - generation cephalosporins may also be considered since the degree of cross reactivity with these agents and penicillin has been shown to be lower than with first - generation agents ( see following cephalosporin section ) [ 1,25 ] .
ideally , management of the patient with penicillin allergy should include penicillin skin testing .
approximately 90 % of patients have negative penicillin skin test responses and can safely receive cephalosporins as well as other beta - lactam agents .
if a penicillin is deemed absolutely necessary in a penicillin - allergic patient , desensitization should be considered , and the procedure should only be performed under medical supervision in - hospital [ 1 ] .
sulfonamides sulfonamide antibiotics are another common cause of drug - induced allergic reactions , and are often associated with delayed cutaneous maculopapular eruptions , sjs and ten .
patients infected with hiv are at increased risk of developing cutaneous reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics , which is likely related to immunologic factors and frequent exposure to these antibiotics .
trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole ( tmp - smx ) is the drug of choice for the treatment of a number of hiv - associated infections and , therefore , many hiv - positive patients with a history of reacting to sulfonamides still require treatment with this antibiotic .
induction of drug tolerance procedures can be used to safely administer tmp - smx to hiv - positive patients with a history of reacting to the antibiotic .
since the chemical structure of non - antibiotic sulfonamides ( e.g. , thiazide diuretics , some nsaids and anticonvulsants ) varies from sulfonamide antibiotics , these agents are not expected to cross - react , and can generally be safely administered to patients with a history of allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics .
an exception is sulfasalazine which , by intestinal degradation becomes sulfapyridine , acquiring an aromatic immunogenic structure like sulfamethoxazole [ 1,26 - 28 ] .
cephalosporins the most common allergic reactions to cephalosporins are maculopapular rashes and drug fever ; urticaria is less common and anaphylaxis is rare [ 25 ] .
as mentioned earlier , positive skin tests to penicillin are associated with a higher likelihood of allergic reactions to first - generation cephalosporins .
in these patients , alternate agents should be considered .
in cephalosporin allergic subjects , there is limited cross reactivity on immunological testing between second - and third - generation cephalosporins and penicillins , especially amino - penicillins , but this has not necessarily indicated clinical reactivity [ 29 ] .
there is a role for skin testing with the proposed antibiotic to be used in therapy , and / or administration by graded challenge .
if skin testing is positive and no alternative drug exists , induction of drug tolerance procedures may be attempted [ 1,5 ] .
radiocontrast media radiocontrast media ( rcm ) are associated with both allergic and pseudoallergic reactions .
the incidence of reactions to rcm , including severe , life - threatening reactions , appears to be lower with non - ionic versus ionic agents .
pseudo / allergic reactions to rcm can usually be prevented through the use of pretreatment regimens that include oral corticosteroids and h1 - antihistamines .
low osmolarity agents should also be used in such circumstances [ 1,5 ] .
local anesthetics true allergic reactions to local anesthetics ( e.g. , novocaine , lidocaine ) are extremely rare ; reactions are usually due to other ingredients in the medication , such as preservatives or epinephrine .
however , if the reaction history is consistent with a possible immediate , ige - mediated ( type i ) reaction , skin testing followed by graded challenge tests using epinephrine - free , preservative - free local anesthetics may be utilized [ 1 ] .
general anesthetics although rare , anaphylaxis may occur in patients under general anesthesia .
the investigation of severe reactions during general anesthesia is particularly challenging given that the patient is often exposed to many co - administered drugs and agents .
reactions during general anesthesia are often due to neuromuscular blocking agents , but have also been associated with intravenous anesthetics ( e.g. , propofol , thiopentone , etomidate ) , antibiotics , nsaids and latex allergy .
there are no reported cases of allergy to inhaled anesthetics .
assessment by an allergist is important for confirming the clinical diagnosis of allergy to general anesthesia , identifying likely causative agents as well as alternative agents that may be used safely in the future [ 30 ] .
acetylsalicylic acid / nsaid reactions acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) and nsaids can cause both true allergic and pseudoallergic reactions , including exacerbations of underlying respiratory diseases , urticaria , angioedema , and anaphylaxis .
patients with underlying chronic respiratory diseases , such as asthma , rhinitis and sinusitis , may react to asa and nsaids that inhibit cyclooxygenase - 1 ( cox - 1 ) .
the management of these patients involves avoidance of aspirin and nsaids and aggressive treatment of the underlying respiratory disorder .
selective cox - 2 inhibitors almost never cause reactions , and can typically be taken safely by patients with asa / nsaid allergy .
an induction of drug tolerance procedure to aspirin ( also known as aspirin desensitization ) may also be considered [ 1 ] .
patients with chronic urticaria / angioedema generally tolerate cox - 2 inhibitors , but may experience exacerbations of urticaria / angioedema with nsaids that inhibit cox - 1 .
true allergic reactions to nsaids are usually drug specific and , therefore , patients experiencing these reactions are often able to tolerate other nsaids [ 1 ] .
prevention of future reactions prevention of future reactions is an essential part of patient management .
the patient should be provided with written information about which drugs to avoid ( including over - the - counter medications ) .
the drugs should be highlighted in the hospital notes and within electronic records ( where available ) , and the patient 's family physician should be informed of the drug allergy .
engraved allergy bracelets / necklaces , such as those provided by medic alert , should also be considered , particularly if the patient has a history of severe drug - induced allergic reactions [ 15 ] .
conclusions drug allergy is a common clinical problem ; assessment by an allergist is important for appropriate diagnosis and management of the condition .
diagnosis relies on a careful history and physical examination and , in some instances , skin testing , graded challenges and induction of drug tolerance procedures may be required .
the mainstay of treatment for drug allergy is avoidance of the offending drug .
when available , alternative medications with unrelated chemical structures should be substituted .
cross - reactivity among drugs should be taken into consideration when choosing alternative medications .
if a particular drug to which the patient is allergic is indicated and there is no suitable alternative , induction of drug tolerance procedures may be considered to induce temporary tolerance to the drug .

background people aging with hiv show variable health trajectories .
our objective was to identify longitudinal predictors of frailty severity and mortality among a group aging with hiv .
methods exploratory analyses employing a multistate transition model , with data from the prospective modena hiv metabolic clinic cohort study , based in northern italy , begun in 2004 .
participants were followed over four years from their first available visit .
we included all 963 participants ( mean age 46.8 +/ - 7.1 ; 29 % female ; 89 % undetectable hiv viral load ; median current cd4 count 549 , iqr 405 - 720 ; nadir cd4 count 180 , 81 - 280 ) with four - year data .
frailty was quantified using a 31 - item frailty index .
outcomes were frailty index score or mortality at four - year follow - up. candidate predictor variables were baseline frailty index score , demographic ( age , sex ) , hiv - disease related ( undetectable hiv viral load , current cd4 + t - cell count , nadir cd4 count , duration of hiv infection , and duration of antiretroviral therapy [ arv ] exposure ) , and behavioral factors ( smoking , injection drug use ( idu ) , and hepatitis c virus co - infection ) .
results four - year mortality was 3.0 % ( n = 29 ) .
in multivariable analyses , independent predictors of frailty index at follow - up were baseline frailty index ( rr 1.06 , 95 % ci 1.05 - 1.07 ) , female sex ( rr 0.93 , 95 % ci 0.87 - 0.98 ) , nadir cd4 cell count ( rr 0.96 , 95 % ci 0.93 - 0.99 ) , duration of hiv infection ( rr 1.06 , 95 % ci 1.01 - 1.12 ) , duration of arv exposure ( rr 1.08 , 95 % ci 1.02 - 1.14 ) , and smoking pack - years ( 1.03 , 1.01 - 1.05 ) .
independent predictors of mortality were baseline frailty index ( or 1.19 , 1.02 - 1.38 ) , current cd4 count ( 0.34 , 0.20 - 0.60 ) , and idu ( 2.89 , 1.30 - 6.42 ) .
conclusions demographic , hiv - disease related , and social and behavioral factors appear to confer risk for changes in frailty severity and mortality among people aging with hiv .

introduction in the era of effective antiretroviral therapy , the number of people aging with hiv is growing .
a product of this success , aging with hiv presents new challenges .
treated hiv infection is associated with an increased risk of many non - communicable health problems , including cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis , kidney disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cognitive and mobility impairment [ 1 - 3 ] .
these conditions span different physiological systems but are all strongly associated with advanced age , leading to the controversial idea that the aging process itself might be accelerated among people with hiv [ 4 ] .
potential contributing factors have been proposed , including chronic inflammation , long - term antiretroviral drug toxicity , and associated social and behavioral risk factors [ 2,5,6 ] .
understanding aging , and factors that might contribute to differences in the aging process , warrants looking beyond individual age - related diseases to the health of the whole person .
though health generally worsens and diseases accumulate with age , these processes are stochastic , inevitably leading to people of the same chronological age exhibiting differences in overall vulnerability [ 7,8 ] including some people who will improve over given , shorter - term intervals .
people who are more vulnerable than others of the same age are said to be frailer [ 9,10 ] .
in this way , frailty can be considered a model of biological ( as opposed to chronological ) aging [ 11,12 ] .
some factors associated with frailty at the same time - point have been identified among people aging with hiv , but few studies have assessed potential predictors of longitudinal changes in frailty severity [ 6,13,14 ] .
here , we applied a multistate transition model of changes in frailty severity over a fixed time interval , based on the frailty index , among a cohort people aging with hiv .
using longitudinal data over a four - year interval we sought to identify potential predictors of transitions in frailty severity , including demographic , hiv and treatment - related , and social and behavioral factors .
methods setting & sample this is an exploratory analysis of longitudinal data from the ongoing modena hiv metabolic clinic ( mhmc ) cohort study , which includes data from patients at the multidisciplinary hiv metabolic clinic at the university of modena and reggio emilia school of medicine in modena , italy .
the mhmc cohort was initiated in 2004 to assess metabolic changes among people with hiv aged 18 years and older [ 15 ] .
participants undergo an annual study assessment .
as this is a clinical study , participants' data are included in the clinical record , and vital status is updated regularly. of 2272 enrolled in the longitudinal study , all mhmc participants with four - year follow - up data from their first visit through july , 2014 were included .
frailty index frailty severity was measured using a frailty index , following the deficit accumulation approach [ 16 - 20 ] .
a person 's frailty index score is calculated as the proportion of deficits present out of all health variables considered .
( for example , if 40 health variables were available in a database , and a person had 8 health deficits present , their frailty index score would be 8 / 40 = 0.20 ) .
health variables ( including signs , symptoms , laboratory abnormalities , or self - reported health measures ) can be included in a frailty index if they meet some basic criteria : variables should characterize acquired health deficits that are generally age - associated , and as a group , should number at least around 30 and cover a range of physiologic systems [ 9,16,20,21 ] .
the frailty index is robust to the items included , so that in different settings it often incorporates different health variables , and does not require the use of the same variables in each index that is constructed .
if the above criteria are met , frailty indices exhibit consistent and reliable characteristics regardless of the individual health variables included - showing typical stochastic dynamics that arise from how deficits interact [ 7,8 ] .
frailty index values theoretically range from 0 to 1 , although mortality consistently approaches 100 % at values around 0.7 ( i.e. 2 / 3 of possible deficits ) [ 18,21 ] .
the frailty index approach has been applied among people as young as 15 years old [ 22 ] , and in multiple clinical populations including among people living with hiv [ 23 ] .
the frailty index approach has been compared favorably to other approaches for measuring frailty [ 24,25 ] , including among people living with hiv [ 26 ] .
in the present study , thirty - one health variables were selected from the mhmc electronic medical record and re - coded so that they represented the presence or absence of a health deficit ( table 1 ) .

demographic factors were age and sex .
hiv - related factors were current cd4 + t - cell count ( indicating the degree of immune recovery with antiretroviral [ arv ] treatment ) , nadir cd4 cell count ( indicating the severity of immune depletion before initiation of antiretroviral treatment ; low nadir cd4 count is associated with late presentation for care ) .
viral load , duration of hiv infection , and duration of arv exposure .
social / behavioral factors were pack - years smoking history , history of injection drug use , and hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) co - infection .
age was categorized by decade .
current and nadir cd4 cell counts were categorized into four clinically relevant groups (< 100 , 101 - 250 , 251 - 500 , and > 500 cells / mm3 ) .
viral load was categorized as detectable or undetectable (<= 40 copies / ml ) .
duration of hiv and arv were categorized by decade .
smoking history was categorized by decades of pack - years .
transition model probabilities of transitions in frailty severity with age can be summarized using a simple stochastic transition model based on the frailty index [ 21,27 - 30 ] .
although health generally worsens with age , the relationship between aging and health is dynamic and periodic improvement and stability in health are common [ 9,21,31 ] .
useful models of biological ageing allow for changes in health that include improvement , maintenance , deterioration , and death [ 32 ] .
covariate estimation allows quantification of other factors that might modify such transitions [ 27 ] .
while individual trajectories of health transitions can appear chaotic , they typically behave in an orderly fashion , and depend on the starting health state - here the number of deficits ( i.e. frailty index score ) that the person has at baseline .
specifically , as detailed previously [ 28 ] , the chance of going from any health state ( frailty index score at baseline ) to a future health state ( frailty index score at follow - up ) depends first on survival .
this is estimated as a logistic function among those who died .
the ambient risk of death is estimated by the chance of dying for the people with the fewest deficits at baseline , and the chance of dying increases with the more things people have wrong with them ( i.e. the higher their frailty index score ) .
for survivors , the probability of the follow - up health state ( frailty index score at follow - up ) follows a poisson distribution and therefore the contribution of multiple covariates can be estimated with a poission regression , based on the generalized linear model [ 27,28 ] .
analysis the primary outcomes were transitions in frailty severity and in mortality at four years .
the probability of transitions from any frailty index value ( number of health deficits out of 31 ) at baseline to any other value ( or death ) were assessed using a multistate transition model , described above [ 27 - 29 ] .
each covariate was first evaluated in univariate models , and covariates significantly associated with the outcomes were added into multivariable models .
significance was set at p < 0.05 .
analyses were performed using spss 21.0 ( ibm corp. , armonk , ny ) .

ethics committee approval the research ethics board of the university of modena and reggio emilia provided approval for the mhmc cohort study and all participants provided written consent .
results of the 2722 participants in the mhmc cohort , 963 had available frailty index scores at baseline and either died or were followed for four years and were included in this study .
participants were generally middle - aged , and just under a third were female ( table 2 ) .
participants generally had high current cd4 cell counts ( median 549 , interquartile range [ iqr ] 405 - 720 ) and undetectable hiv viral load .
median nadir cd4 was 180 ( iqr 81 - 280 ) .
fifty three percent of participants had a lower frailty index score after four years than at first study visit , while 18.5 % maintained the same frailty index score and 28.1 % worsened .

discussion we assessed four - year transitions in frailty severity and mortality among italians aging with hiv using a multistate modeling approach based on a frailty index , and identified predictors of frailty severity and of mortality .
many predictors were important , with baseline frailty index , sex , current and nadir cd4 cell count , duration of hiv infection , duration of hiv exposure , injection drug use , hcv co - infection and smoking history all associated with outcomes after four years .
frailty is a model of biological aging , and our findings suggest that biological aging is a multifactorial process among people living with hiv .
notably , many of these factors are not specific to hiv infection .
over half of the sample improved in frailty status over four years , and protective factors included female sex , higher current and nadir cd4 cell counts , and fewer smoking pack years .
some factors contributing to frailty might be meaningfully modifiable for individuals and for populations , including baseline frailty , immune status , and behavioral factors .
our findings should be interpreted with caution .
the mhmc cohort includes men and women living in northern italy who are generally middle - aged , and around a quarter of whom inject drugs , and our findings may not be generalizable to other settings or comparable to some previously published research .
for example , frailty has previously been assessed among people living with hiv within cohorts of men who have sex with men [ 33,34 ] and within cohorts of people who inject drugs [ 35,36 ] .
also , our analysis of morality predictors identified fewer and different factors compared to our analysis of frailty predictors , and included wider confidence intervals .
this may be due in part to the relatively few deaths over the follow - up period ( which is in turn reflective of the greatly increased life expectancy among people living with treated hiv today ) , and thereby likely reflects a lack of statistical power .
over longer follow - up further predictors of long - term mortality may be identified .
recent reviews have summarized what is known about frailty and age - related health conditions in people living with hiv [ 4 - 6,13,14,37 - 39 ] .
most studies use modified versions of the fried frailty phenotype instrument [ 13,40,41 ] , which classifies people as " frail " , " pre - frail " , or " robust "/" not frail " .
few previous studies have applied the frailty index approach in an hiv setting [ 23,26,42 ] .
as it grades degrees of frailty , the frailty index approach is suitable for investigating what can be subtle changes in how health changes as people age , a benefit that we have aimed to exploit here by situating aging with hiv in the context of aging as deficit accumulation .
in cross - sectional analyses , frailty has been associated with demographic , biological , and social factors , including older age , immune system dysfunction , duration of arv , medical comorbidities , lower education , and lower income [ 13 ] .
few longitudinal studies have assessed the progression of frailty among people with hiv [ 6,13,14 ] .
escota and colleagues assessed frailty status over time in the sun study using a modified version of fried frailty phenotype instrument [ 43 ] .
over a median follow - up of 12 months , the majority of participants who were " not frail " at baseline remained " not frail " at follow - up , while the majority of participants who were " frail " at baseline transitioned to " not frail " .
participants who remained " prefrail " or " frail " from baseline to follow - up more often had hcv co - infection , lower median hemoglobin , and higher veterans aging cohort study index scores [ 43 ] .
althoff and colleagues evaluated factors associated with transitioning from not frail to frail between study visits among hiv - positive men who have sex with men in the macs study [ 33 ] .
predictors of transitions included less than college education , having a history of aids , and having depressive symptoms , diabetes , or kidney disease .
our findings are consistent with this in that we found the progression of frailty to be multifactorial , including having a low nadir cd4 cell count ( or history of aids ) and hcv co - infection .
other measures of overall age - related health , associated with frailty , have been assessed in longitudinal studies which identify predictors of biological aging .
in the anrs co3 aquitaine cohort , richert and colleagues found that middle - aged adults with hiv experienced greater - than - expected declines in six - minute walk test time and five times sit - to - stand ( 5tsts ) test time [ 44 ] .
predictors of decline in 5tsts test time were history of idu , cerebral complications of hiv disease , and diabetes .
molsberry and colleagues assessed longitudinal trajectories of cognition in men with and without hiv in the macs study [ 45 ] .
they identified heterogeneity in cognitive aging , with a history of aids , hepatitis c virus infection , depression , and race all associated with premature cognitive aging .
our finding that duration of hiv disease and duration of arv exposure were independently associated with worse health transitions conflicts with a recent report finding no association between these factors and multiple age - related diseases [ 1 ] .
it is also complicated by the notion that earlier start of arv , often at higher cd4 counts , is associated with better health outcomes .
this is an important area for future research , if ongoing arv exposure could actually accelerate the aging process in some way .
this question of the independent contributions of nadir cd4 cell count and duration of arv is motivating further inquiry by our group .
a growing body of data from general population and non - hiv clinical settings suggests that the rate of aging is influenced by both extrinsic factors , which determine environmental insults , and intrinsic factors , which determine an organism 's ability to repair damage [ 27,29 ] .
this was confirmed among people with hiv in the present study , where we found that frailty severity , demographic factors , immune status , duration of hiv infection , duration of arv exposure , and behavioral factors were all predictive of transitions in health status and / or mortality .
the fact that health state transitions , measured by changes in frailty index over time , are multifactorial supports previous cross - sectional data [ 6,13 ] .
some of these factors are modifiable , suggesting future opportunities for interventions to prevent or delay the progression of frailty .
other factors may help illustrate the pathophysiology of aging and frailty in people living with hiv and aging in general .
for example , nadir cd4 + t - cell count is a predictor of health transitions , suggesting that lasting effects on the immune system from cd4 cell depletion may influence the rate of aging .
clinically , early detection of hiv and initiation of arv may prevent the lasting effects of immune depletion .
as the hiv - positive population continues to age , understanding of the aging process , risk for age - related diseases , geriatric syndromes , and frailty among people with hiv becomes even more important [ 39 ] .
higher rates of many different age - related comorbidities have been identified among people aging with hiv compared to general population rates [ 1 - 3,5 ] .
the available evidence suggests that the aging process might differ in some ways among people living with hiv , and might be modestly accelerated in general .
people aging with hiv represent a highly heterogeneous group in terms of health status and risk factors [ 39 ] .
exploration of the present model of biological aging in other datasets is needed , as well as further longitudinal studies of ageing and health among people with hiv .
further research is needed on the intersection between frailty , hiv , and related , acquired age - associated risk states , such as diabetes [ 46 ] , copd [ 47 ] , social isolation [ 48 ] , and food insecurity [ 49,50 ] .
we identified factors across multiple domains that were predictive of health transitions , and not all were specific to hiv infection .
trials to test interventions aimed at recognized risk factors are also needed .

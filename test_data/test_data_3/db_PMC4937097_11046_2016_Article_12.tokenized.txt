invasive aspergillosis ( ia ) is increasingly diagnosed in high - risk patients .
the lesions are usually located in the lungs and / or sinuses , and the fungus may spread haematogenously to different organs ; however , involvement of the heart during ia is very rare .
we describe a unique case of invasive aspergillosis of the heart septum and the lungs in the allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient .
keywords invasive aspergillosis heart lung stem cell transplantation amphotericin b issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media dordrecht 2016 introduction patients receiving chemo - and / or radiotherapy treated with glucocorticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are at high risk of systemic fungal infection [ 1 , 2 ] .
another high - risk group constitutes patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( aids ) , solid organ transplant ( sot ) recipients and with congenital immune deficiencies [ 1 ] .
at particularly high risk of systemic fungal infections , compared to other groups of patients , are patients hospitalised in haematological wards [ 3 ] .
risk factors for these infections are neutropaenia , particularly deep (< 500 neutrophils / mm3 ) and long lasting (> 7 days ) , and lymphopaenia , pertaining especially to cd4 + cells .
however , the highest risk of systemic fungal infections is reported in the recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplants [ 2 ] .
furthermore , graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd ) and its treatment with corticosteroids make these patients susceptible to fungal infections caused by moulds classified in the genus aspergillus or yeast - like fungi of candida spp .
[ 4 ] .
moreover , in the aspect of defective immune response , the chronic form of gvhd causes functional asplenia in these patients .
the most common aetiological factors of invasive fungal infection ( ifi ) remain candidaalbicans and aspergillus fumigatus [ 3 ] .
the broad use of fluconazole in prophylaxis of these infections caused an increase in isolation rates of candida non - albicans strains as well as a further increase in frequency of aspergillus spp. infections .
among patients with invasive aspergillosis with pneumonia and sinusitis , with subsequent haematogenous spread to other organs , mortality may reach 80 - 90 % [ 5 - 10 ] .
case report a 45 - year - old man was admitted as an emergency to the haematology ward because of fever , nausea , vomiting , diarrhoea and severe prostration , which have been lasting for several days .
the patient suffered from a mantle cell lymphoma and was in the 45th day after allogeneic transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells ( allohsct ) from a related donor , after myeloablative conditioning .
on physical examination tachycardia , hypotension , high levels of inflammatory markers and marked dehydration were detected .
laboratory tests showed acute renal insufficiency of complex aetiology : prerenal ( due to dehydration ) and intrinsic - - with the symptoms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ttp ) and kidney damage , which resulted from cyclosporine nephrotoxicity .
in histopathological examination of biopsy specimens obtained during sigmoidoscopy , acute graft - versus - host disease ( agvhd ) had been diagnosed .
during high - resolution computed tomography ( hr - ct ) scan of the chest , a typical radiological picture of pulmonary mycosis was detected .
galactomannan ( gm ) has been detected in the patient 's serum , while the test for the presence of gm in the bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) fluid was not done .
therapy with lipid complex amphotericin b was administered ( 5 mg / kg / day ) , and control examinations showed a slow regression of inflammatory lesions in the lungs .
due to a marked fur on oral mucous membranes , several mycological cultures were done , which yielded the growth of pichia kluyveri and candida albicans .
mycological cultures of bal and sputum were negative .
treatment with lipid complex amphotericin b was continued .
during subsequent weeks of hospitalisation , the patient was treated for hypogammaglobulinaemia , reactivation of cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) , epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) and adenovirus in peripheral blood , as well as for giardia lamblia infection of the gastrointestinal tract .
he was also diagnosed with papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland , for which strumectomy was performed .
two episodes of ileus were recorded during hospital stay .
during the patient 's hospitalisation , several evaluations of post - transplant chimerism were done .
results of all tests ( done on peripheral blood and on bone marrow samples taken > 100 days after allopbsct ) were normal .
myelogram of the trepanobiopsy specimen revealed dysmegakaryopoiesis ; however , phenotyping of the bone marrow cells did not show lymphoma relapse .
cytogenetic tests also did not show aberrations .
hr - ct scans of the chest , abdominal cavity and neck were performed in search for possible relapse of the basic disease .
a single enlarged ( dimension of 19 mm ) , probably reactive , lymph node was detected in the abdominal cavity .
due to episodes of septic shock , the patient was treated with antibiotics ( imipenem , colistin , linezolid , tigecycline ) , an antiviral agent ( acyclovir ) and a lipid complex of amphotericin b , as well as a granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( g - csf ) .
at that stage , laboratory tests showed increasing levels of inflammatory markers as well as increasing lactic acidosis and its respiratory compensation .
the patient required oxygen therapy .
pulmonary embolism was excluded during bedside echocardiography examination .
the lipid complex of amphotericin b was temporarily discontinued ( after 93 days of therapy ) in fear for development of acidosis as an unwanted effect of this antifungal agent ( renal canalicular and tubular acidosis ) .
furthermore , clinical symptoms of acute pancreatitis and a sudden increase in pancreatic enzyme levels had been recorded .
during subsequent days , the patient suffered from increasing shortness of breath ; however , in a chest x - ray examination neither obvious parenchymal lung lesions nor haemostasis in the pulmonary circulation had been detected .
after nephrological consultation of the patient , a dialysis catheter had been inserted into the femoral vein , and therefore , amphotericin b therapy was not continued .
due to an increasing metabolic acidosis ( ph 7.3 ) and lactate levels , symptoms of acute pancreatitis and persistent paralytic ileus , a ct scan of the abdominal cavity was performed to exclude mesenteric artery thrombosis and intestinal ischaemia as a possible cause of these abnormalities .
however , no mesenteric embolism or clear signs of acute pancreatitis were detected .
there were also no indications for surgical intervention .
the patient 's condition continued to deteriorate , and he was transferred to the intensive care unit ( icu ) .
on admission to the icu , his condition was severe , with borderline respiratory function .
his status of consciousness was assessed as score 14 of the glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) .
haemodialysis was performed ; however , despite intensive therapy , hypoglycaemia and acidosis were deepening and the patient died .
blood culture of a sample obtained just before his death had shown the presence of non - fermenting gram - negative rod brevundimonas nasdae .
no fungi were cultured .
an autopsy examination revealed marked hyperaemia and tissue oedema in both lungs , as well as irregular regions of increased consistency , particularly in the lower lobes of both lungs .
microscopically , the lesions had been described as organising abscesses with necrosis in the central zone and the presence of hyphae typical for aspergillus spp .
( fig. 1 ) .
in the interventricular septum of the heart , hypertrophy of single cardiomyocytes had been noted , as well as an abscess with aspergillus spp. hyphae present within the central necrosis zone ( figs. 2 , 3 , 4 ). fig. 1 lung : necrosis within the aspergillus spp. mycelium .

magnification x100 discussion in the described case , allogeneic transplantation of peripheral blood haematopoietic stem cells ( allopbhsct ) constituted a major risk factor for ifi caused by moulds classified in the genus aspergillus .
fungal lesions with hyphae characteristic for aspergillus spp. had been detected in anatomopathological investigations both in the heart and in the lungs , despite treatment of the patient with amphotericin b , according to the infectious diseases society of america ( idsa ) guidelines .
furthermore , after transplantation the patient suffered from gvhd .
this complication develops in 60 - 80 % of allohsct recipients .
it results from a reaction of allogeneic t lymphocytes , derived from the transplanted cells and directed against the recipient 's antigens .
a disease developing within 100 days after transplantation is called an acute gvhd .
in the case of allohsct , recipients remain in deep immunosuppression , which makes them prone to ifis , caused by yeast - like fungi of the genus candida , as well as by moulds aspergillus spp .
[ 4 ] .
the most common is invasive aspergillosis ( 3 - 14 %) .
the fungal spores of aspergillus are inhaled ; therefore , the most common clinical forms are infections of the respiratory tract and systemic infections , involving all types of organs , including the heart , although this location is very rare [ 11 - 14 ] .
invasive aspergillosis often begins with invasion of the blood vessels ; their obstruction caused by thrombus with mycelium , as well as with haemorrhagic infarctions , which are very characteristic for this type of infections [ 15 ] .
the infarction zone comprises ischaemic necrosis caused by blood vessel blockage .
hyphae of the mould are seen within the necrotic tissues .
haematogenous spread may involve the brain , heart , kidneys and gastrointestinal tract mucous membranes .
the presence of aspergillus hyphae in the tissue justifies the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis ; however , it is recommended to send such material also for mycological culture for species identification .
bapat and young [ 16 ] reported a case of fungal endocarditis in a 73 - year - old man , in whom this complication followed surgical replacement of the aortic valve and coronary artery bypass surgery ( table 1 ) .
a diagnosis of fungal endocarditis on clinical grounds alone is very difficult because of non - specific symptoms , such as fever ( 72 %) , embolic episodes ( 69 %) , new or changing heart murmurs ( 41 %) or sudden visual loss ( 13 %) [ 17 ] .
diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that blood cultures are usually negative [ 2 , 3 ] .
unfortunately , very often a diagnosis is made at post - mortem examination .
in the described case , a laboratory diagnosis was made on the basis of histopathological tests of the thrombus removed during embolectomy , as endocarditis may rarely cause emboli in the peripheral blood vessels .
to avoid a relapse of the fungal infection , it is recommended to perform surgery and administer long - term antifungal therapy with amphotericin b [ 16 ] .

[ 20 ] extensive cardiothoracic aspergillosis in a 47 - year - old man no risk factors for immunosuppression echocardiography , magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography : extensive infiltration of the atria and ventricles by the mediastinal lesion ; histopathological examination of the subcutaneous nodule on the chest revealed aspergillus granuloma ( growth of a. fumigatus in culture ) ; fine - needle aspiration cytology from the mediastinum revealed aspergillus granuloma ; no fungal mycelium was detected in the endomyocardial biopsy from the right atrial side of the atrial septum alvarez et al .
[ 18 ] described a case of a 12 - year - old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at haematological remission , hospitalised due to fever , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pains and pancytopaenia .
upon admission , a combined antimicrobial therapy with vancomycin , gentamycin and amphotericin b was started .
during echocardiography , masses had been noticed in the apex of the left ventricle of the heart .
she underwent surgery , and culture of clinical specimens revealed the growth of aspergillus terreus .
embolic infarctions of the spleen , liver and the kidneys were detected in ct. there were no symptoms or signs of relapse of endocarditis caused by aspergillus spp. ; however , 28 days after surgery she suffered from severe headaches and dizziness .
ct scan showed cerebral haemorrhage , which comprised the right temporal lobe of the brain .
the patient died the following day .
due to an increasing number of patients treated with immunosuppressive agents , as well as an increase in frequency of fungal infections caused by aspergillus strains , early diagnosis and proper antifungal therapy increase the chance for patients' survival .
however , in the described case the patient died despite rapid surgical intervention .
it is therefore important to stress that fungal endocarditis in patients with acute leukaemia may compromise their prognosis and decrease the rate of survival [ 18 ] .
abuzaid et al .
[ 19 ] published a case of a 64 - year - old woman admitted to an emergency ward due to acute respiratory failure , with several underlying diseases : diabetes , arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia .
severe mitral regurgitation was observed in echocardiography , and the patient was qualified for surgical valve replacement .
vancomycin and gentamycin were administered as empiric therapy .
several days later , aspergillosis of the heart was confirmed by the isolation of a strain of a. fumigatus from her heart valve removed during surgery and treatment was changed to intravenous voriconazole .
both rapid surgical intervention and proper antifungal therapy improve prognosis of patients with infective endocarditis caused by aspergillus spp. similarly , early administration of proper antifungal therapy and fast surgical intervention also improve the chance for survival of patients with invasive aspergillosis of the heart .
however , due to non - specific clinical symptoms ( fever , episodes of thrombosis , heart murmurs ) additional tests - - such as histopathology , echocardiography , mycological cultures and serological assays - - are useful [ 2 ] .
satish et al .
[ 20 ] described a case of cardiothoracic aspergillosis , although no fungal mycelium was detected in the heart .
we report a case of invasive aspergillosis located in the interventricular septum of the heart and in both lungs of an immunocompromised patient .
on histopathological examination , hyphae typical for aspergillus spp. were observed .
the patient died despite therapy with amphotericin b , according to the idsa guidelines .
recently it has been suggested that combination therapy with voriconazole and anidulafungin may improve the outcome of ia [ 21 ] .
it is known that strains of aspergillus spp. may form a biofilm , which might be disrupted by echinocandins , while azoles do not penetrate it. due to an increasing number of patients on immunosuppressive therapy and an increase in frequency of cases of invasive aspergillosis , in each case of probable infection of this aetiology , other tests ( such as histopathology , imaging , non - culture diagnostic assays ) - - apart from clinical signs and symptoms - - are recommended , as they may help with earlier diagnosis and improved survival of these patients [ 3 , 19 , 22 ] .

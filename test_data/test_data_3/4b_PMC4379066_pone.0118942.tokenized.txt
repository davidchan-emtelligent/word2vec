vinpocetine is a safe nootropic agent used for neurological and cerebrovascular diseases .
the anti - inflammatory activity of vinpocetine has been shown in cell based assays and animal models , leading to suggestions as to its utility in analgesia .
however , the mechanisms regarding its efficacy in inflammatory pain treatment are still not completely understood .
herein , the analgesic effect of vinpocetine and its anti - inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms were addressed in murine inflammatory pain models .
firstly , we investigated the protective effects of vinpocetine in overt pain - like behavior induced by acetic acid , phenyl - p - benzoquinone ( pbq ) and formalin .
the intraplantar injection of carrageenan was then used to induce inflammatory hyperalgesia .
mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated using the electronic von frey and the hot plate tests , respectively , with neutrophil recruitment to the paw assessed by a myeloperoxidase activity assay .
a number of factors were assessed , both peripherally and in the spinal cord , including : antioxidant capacity , reduced glutathione ( gsh ) levels , superoxide anion , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf - alpha ) and interleukin 1 beta ( il - 1beta ) levels , as well as nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kappab ) activation .
vinpocetine inhibited the overt pain - like behavior induced by acetic acid , pbq and formalin ( at both phases ) , as well as the carrageenan - induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and associated neutrophil recruitment .
both peripherally and in the spinal cord , vinpocetine also inhibited : antioxidant capacity and gsh depletion ; increased superoxide anion ; il - 1beta and tnf - alpha levels ; and nf - kappab activation .
as such , vinpocetine significantly reduces inflammatory pain by targeting oxidative stress , cytokine production and nf - kappab activation at both peripheral and spinal cord levels .

introduction modern lifestyle has raised life expectancy , but also increased the incidence of chronic diseases [ 1 ] , consequently increasing chronic pharmaceutical usage .
inflammation is a hallmark of many chronic diseases , with the long - term use of steroids and / or non - steroid anti - inflammatory drugs leading , in many instances , to hormonal side effects and gastric lesions [ 2,3 ] .
as such , the development of novel anti - inflammatory drugs and treatment approaches is urgently needed .
vinpocetine ( ethyl apovincamine - 22 - oate ) is a synthetic ethyl ester of the alkaloid apovincamine , which is isolated from the leaves of vinca minor , commonly known as the lesser periwinkle [ 4 ] .
vinpocetine has been used in the management of various cerebrovascular disorders , including cerebral infarction and residual cerebral hemorrhage [ 5 ] , as well as in the treatment of cognitive disorders [ 4 ] .
importantly , no significant vinpocetine side effects have been reported [ 6 ] , whilst its positive effects on cognition are even apparent in health volunteers [ 7 ] .
as well as being a phosphodiasterase - 1 inhibitor [ 8 ] , the emerging literature suggests that vinpocetine also has potent anti - inflammatory effects via phosphodiasterase - 1 - independent inhibition of nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kappab ) signaling and the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines , such as il - 1beta and tnf - alpha [ 9 ] .
moreover , it has been shown that vinpocetine inhibits neuronal reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production [ 10,11 ] , thereby decreasing oxidative stress [ 12 ] .
the pro - inflammatory cytokines tnf - alpha and il - 1beta , in conjunction with ros , such as the superoxide anion radical , are important peripheral and spinal hyperalgesic mediators and therefore represent relevant targets for analgesic drug development [ 13,14 ] .
an analgesic role for vinpocetine is supported by its clinical utility in a wide range of neuroinflammatory human diseases , including multiple sclerosis [ 15 ] , intracranial birth trauma - induced seizures [ 16 ] , and chronic brain ischemia [ 17 ] .
data pertinent to the analgesic effect of vinpocetine show that it inhibits neuronal tetrodotoxin - resistant nav1.8 sodium channel currents and sodium current - induced calcium influx [ 18,19 ] , with intraperitoneal ( i.p ) administration of vinpocetine reducing acetic acid - induced visceral nociception , which was potentiated by muscarinic , adrenergic or opioid receptor blockade and dependent on adenosine receptors [ 20 ] .
vinpocetine also inhibits formalin - induced paw flinching , accompanied by inhibition of c - fos expression in the ipsilateral dorsal horn , when perineurally administered [ 21 ] .
it has been also suggested that vinpocetine reduces neuropathic pain by blocking retrograde axoplasmic transport of nerve growth factor [ 21 ] .
however , the peripheral and spinal effects of vinpocetine in inflammatory hyperalgesia and its mechanisms of action require investigation .
given the above literature , the present study aimed to investigate the effects of orally administered vinpocetine in a murine inflammatory pain model .
in addition , we also assessed whether the analgesic effects of vinpocetine were related to peripheral and spinal inhibition of oxidative stress and cytokine production , as well as nf - kappab activity .
material and methods animals male swiss mice ( 25 - 30 g ) from the universidade estadual de londrina , londrina , parana , brazil , were used in this study .
mice were housed in standard clear plastic cages with free access to food and water with a light / dark cycle of 12 / 12h at a constant temperature of 21degreesc .
all behavioral testing was performed between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. in a temperature - controlled ( 21degreesc ) room .
animal care and handling procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the universidade estadual de londrina ( process number 13278.2011.3 ) .
all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used .
drugs and stimuli materials were obtained from the sources as follows : vinpocetine ( marjan industria & comercio ltda , sao paulo , brazil ) , carrageenan ( fmc corp , philadelphia , pa , united states ) , acetic acid and formaldehyde ( mallinckrodt baker , s.a. , mexico , mexico city ) , phenyl - p - benzoquinone ( sigma chemical company , st. louis , mo ) .
experimental procedures mice received per oral ( p.o. ) treatment with vinpocetine ( 1 , 3 , 10 , or 30 mg / kg ) 1 h before the inflammatory stimulus .
the dose of inflammatory stimuli was based on previous studies in our laboratory [ 22 - 25 ] .
the writhing response was evaluated during the 20 min after i.p. injection of phenyl - p - benzoquinone ( pbq ) ( 1890 mug / kg ) or acetic acid 0.6 % ( 10 ml / kg ) .
the number of formalin ( formalin 1.5 % , 25 mul / paw ) - induced flinches was evaluated during the 30 min after injection .
mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia was evaluated 1 - 9 h after carrageenan ( 100 mug , 25 mul , i.pl. ) , with neutrophil recruitment in paw skin indicated by myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) activity assay 9 h after carrageenan injection .
il - 1beta , tnf - alpha , total nf - kappab and phosphorylated nf - kappab levels were measured in the paw skin and spinal cord 3 h after carrageenan injection .
the experimenters evaluating the recorded responses were blind as to specific treatments being assessed .
writing response tests the pbq and acetic acid - induced writhing models were performed as previously described [ 25 ] .
pbq ( dmso 2 % , v / v in saline ) , acetic acid ( 0.6 % , v / v in saline ) or vehicle were injected into the peritoneal cavities of mice pre - treated with vinpocetine ( 1 - 30 mg / kg , p.o. ) .
the intensity of overt pain - like behavior is expressed as the cumulative number of writhings over 20 minutes after stimulus injection .
formalin test the number of paw flinches were determined between 0 - 30 minutes after 25 mul formalin i.pl. injection , as previously described [ 26 ] .
the period was divided into intervals of 5 minutes , and clearly demonstrated the presence of the first ( 0 - 5 min ) and second ( 15 - 30 min ) phase , which are characteristic of the test .
results are presented as the number of flinches in the first and second phases .
mechanical hyperalgesia test mechanical hyperalgesia was measured by an electronic version of von frey filaments [ 27 ] .
the test consisted of evoking a hind paw reflex with a hand - held force transducer ( electronic anesthesiometer ; insight , ribeirao preto , sp , brazil ) .
after the paw withdrawal , the intensity of the pressure was recorded automatically , with values being averaged across three measurements .
mice were tested before ( basal ) and after stimulus injection .
the results are expressed as delta ( delta ) withdrawal threshold ( in g ) , calculated by subtracting the basal mean measurements from the mean measurements obtained at 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , or 9 h after carrageenan i.pl. injection .
hot plate test mice were placed on a hot plate apparatus ( iitc life science inc. woodland hills , ca ) maintained at 55degreesc .
the reaction time was indicated by the time for the animal to jump or lick their paws .
a maximum latency ( cut - off ) was set at 30 s to avoid tissue damage [ 28 ] .
mpo activity myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) activity , an indicant of neutrophil recruitment to the paw skin , was evaluated by the mpo kinetic - colorimetric assay [ 29 ] .
samples were homogenized using a tissue - tearor ( biospec ) in ice - cold k2hpo4 buffer ( 400 mul , 50 mm , ph 6.0 ) containing htab ( 0.5 % weight / volume ) , and the homogenates were centrifuged ( 16100 g x 2 min x 4degreesc ) .

the absorbance was determined after 5 min at 450 nm ( multiskan go microplate spectrophotometer , thermo scientific , vantaa , finland ) .
the results of mpo activity are expressed as the number of neutrophils per mg of tissue by using a standard curve of neutrophils ( 196 - 400000 cells ) .
abts and frap assays the ability of samples to resist oxidative damage was determined by their free radical scavenging ( abts [ 2,2 ' - azinobis - 3 - ethylbenzothiazoline 6 - sulfonic acid ] assay ) and ferric reducing ( frap assay ) properties .
the tests were adapted to a 96 - well microplate format as previously described [ 30 ] .
plantar tissue samples were collected 3 h after carrageenan i.pl. injection ( 100 mug , 25 mul ) and homogenized immediately in ice - cold kcl buffer ( 500 mul , 1.15 % w / v ) .
the homogenates were centrifuged ( 200 g x 10 min x 4degreesc ) , and the supernatants were used in both assays .

after 6 min of incubation at 25degreesc , the absorbance was measured at 730 nm. for frap assay , the supernatants ( 10 mul ) were mixed with the freshly prepared frap reagent ( 150 mul ) .
the reaction mixture was incubated at 37degreesc for 30 min , and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm ( multiskan go thermo scientific ) .
the results of abts and frap assays were equated against a standard trolox curve ( 0.02 - 20 nmol ) .
gsh levels measurement samples of paw skin and spinal cord were collected and maintained at - 80degreesc for at least 48 h. the sample was homogenized with 200 mul of 0.02 m edta .
the homogenate was mixed with 25 mul of trichloroacetic acid 50 % and was homogenized three times over 15 min .

a standard gsh curve was formed .
the results are expressed as gsh per mg of protein [ 31 ] .
superoxide anion production the quantification of superoxide anion production in tissue homogenates ( 10 mg / ml in 1.15 % kcl ) was performed using the nitroblue tetrazolium ( nbt ) assay [ 32 ] .
briefly , 50 mul of the homogenate was incubated with 100 mul of nbt ( 1 mg / ml ) in 96 - well plates at 37degreesc for 1 h. the supernatant was then carefully removed and the reduced formazan solubilized by adding 120 mul of koh 2m and 140 mul of dmso .
the nbt reduction was measured at 600 nm ( multiskan go , thermo scientific ) .
the tissue weight was used for data normalization .
cytokine measurement paw skin and spinal cord ( l4 - l6 ) samples were homogenized in 500 mul of buffer containing protease inhibitors , with il - 1beta and tnf - alpha levels being determined as previously described by an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) using ebioscience kits [ 31 ] .
the results are expressed as picograms ( pg ) of cytokine / 100 mg of tissue .

discussion increased pain sensitivity is a common feature of the inflammatory response and occurs after tissue injury .
the peripheral sensitization is triggered by nf - kappab - related pro - inflammatory mediators , including the cytokines tnf - alpha and il - 1beta [ 14,33,34 ] , as well as ros such as the superoxide anion radical [ 35 ] .
in addition to their role in the inflammatory response , these mediators can act directly on their receptors or targets expressed by peripheral terminals of nociceptors to reduce pain thresholds , leading to inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia [ 36,37 ] .
moreover , they induce the recruitment of neutrophils , leading to the further enhancement of hyperalgesic mediators , such as prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) and the superoxide anion [ 33,35 ] .
consequently , inhibiting the production of such hyperalgesic mediators is an important pain control target [ 14,34 ] .
it is important to note that in a number of diseases inflammatory hyperalgesia is the major symptom responsible for reducing quality of life [ 38,39 ] , which is often further reduced by the side effects occurring from the chronic use of corticosteroids and non - steroid anti - inflammatory drugs [ 2,3 ] .
in this study , we described the anti - hyperalgesic effects of vinpocetine , showing that its mechanism of action targets peripheral and spinal cord oxidative stress , tnf - alpha , il - 1beta and nf - kappab activation .
vinpocetine is a safe nootropic agent that is widely used to improve memory and to treat neurological diseases .
vinpocetine has a low oral bioavailability , achieving about 0.7 % absorption in humans [ 40 ] , although its absorption may increase to 60 - 100 % in non - fasted individuals [ 41 ] .
radio - labeled vinpocetine ( 10 mg tablet ) administered orally to humans appears in the blood and brain shortly after administration and increases continuously for at least 120 and 100 min , respectively [ 40 ] .
these being the maximal periods investigated in each tissue .
[ 40 ] .
therefore , orally administrated vinpocetine is rapidly distributed throughout the entire body explaining its therapeutic use and commercialization .
preclinical studies using acetic acid - and formalin - induced overt pain - like behaviors shows vinpocetine to exert analgesic effects when administered via i.p or perineural routes , respectively [ 20,21 ] .
our results support such research , showing that vinpocetine exhibits analgesic effects in acetic acid - , pbq - and formalin - induced overt pain - like behaviors , even when administered orally , thereby confirming its applicability as an orally active analgesic in such models .
in fact , the potential therapeutic importance of vinpocetine has generated a large number of studies that have attempted to improve its absorption [ 42 ] , thereby allowing a reduced dose for therapeutic effect and / or increased efficacy .
importantly , these animal models , except the first phase of formalin test , depend on cytokine production to induce inflammation and pain [ 25,43 ] , suggesting that inflammatory pain attenuation by vinpocetine depends , at least in part , on decreasing the production of such mediators .
recent work shows vinpocetine to afford protection in numerous inflammatory conditions , including atherosclerosis [ 44,45 ] , lung inflammation [ 9 ] , macular degeneration [ 46 ] and cerebral ischemia - reperfusion injury [ 47 ] .
in these studies , the vinpocetine anti - inflammatory effect was at least partly driven by its attenuation of nf - kappab activity and its inflammatory products , such as tnf - alpha and il - 1beta .
carrageenan and lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) from gram - negative bacteria activate tlr4 / myd88 signaling , thereby triggering nf - kappab activation and the cytokines , including tnf - alpha and il - 1beta , which are responsible for pain and inflammation [ 48 - 50 ] .
targeting tlr4 / myd88 , nf - kappab , tnf - alpha and il - 1beta reduces carrageenan - and lps - induced hyperalgesia [ 14,33,51 ] .
therefore , we reason that the attenuation of nf - kappab activity , including by decreasing tnf - alpha and il - 1beta production , is an important determinant of vinpocetine 's analgesic effects .
nf - kappab heterodimer p50 / p65 activates the transcription of a large number of genes , many of which are key mediators of the inflammatory response [ 52 - 54 ] .
inhibiting nf - kappab signaling impairs neutrophil recruitment during acute inflammation by reducing the expression of nf - kappab target genes , including pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 55 - 57 ] .
tnf - alpha and il - 1beta are crucial mediators in the recruitment of neutrophils after tissue injury by directly chemoattracting neutrophils and activating resident inflammatory cells , which further amplifies the production of chemotactic molecules [ 56 - 59 ] .
neutrophils , in turn , play an important role in carrageenan - induced hyperalgesia as these cells provide an important source of the superoxide anion and other hyperalgesic mediators , such as pge2 [ 33,60,61 ] .
in this study , we found that vinpocetine reduced neutrophil recruitment , as assessed by mpo activity .
neutrophils produce large amounts of the superoxide anion , thereby contributing to many of the deleterious effects of inflammation , such as oxidative stress , tissue injury and hyperalgesia [ 33,60,61 ] .
in agreement with this , we showed vinpocetine to also inhibit the carrageenan - induced peripheral decrease in antioxidant capacity and gsh levels .
previous work , in a rat demyelination model , showed vinpocetine to reduce oxidative stress [ 12 ] , although , the association of oxidative stress with increased pro - inflammatory cytokines was not addressed in this study .
considering the dependency of carrageenan - induced hyperalgesia on not only tnf - alpha and il - 1beta production [ 33 ] , but also oxidative stress [ 35,62 ] , and the peripheral inhibition of these cytokines and oxidative stress by vinpocetine treatment reported here , our results serve to better integrate previous work that separately described the analgesic , anti - inflammatory and antioxidant effects of vinpocetine [ 9,11,12,20,21,45 - 47 ] .
inflammation - induced peripheral nociceptor sensitization leads to increases in nociceptor inputs and in nociceptive stimuli transmission .
this enhanced afferent activity , in turn , induces long - lasting increases in the excitability of spinal cord neurons and contributes to inflammatory pain hypersensitivity [ 63 ] .
this central sensitization shares some mechanisms with the peripheral sensitization process .
at the level of the spinal cord , as well as in dorsal root ganglion , glial cells act as sentinels of neuronal activity and damage .
glial cells produce inflammatory mediators in response to raised glutamate , as occurs during increased neurotransmission .
among these mediators , tnf - alpha , il - 1beta and the superoxide anion act synergistically to sensitize nociceptive neurons [ 63,64 ] .
in line with this , we found that vinpocetine also attenuated nf - kappab activation , as well as tnf - alpha , il - 1beta and oxidative stress at the spinal cord level , which may represent an important anti - hyperalgesic mechanism in the spinal cord .
in line with this hypothesis , vinpocetine can inhibit glutamate signaling [ 65 ] as well as the calcium and sodium channel - mediated release of glutamate from nerve endings [ 18,66 ] .
vinpocetine also affords neuroprotection by reducing nf - kappab expression , and il - 1beta and tnf - alpha production , by microglia cells [ 9,11,18 ] .
the central anti - inflammatory effect of vinpocetine was further shown by its decrease in hippocampal tnf - alpha and il - 1beta production in a preclinical study of the pro - convulsive agents , 4 - aminopyridine , pentylenetetrazole and pilocarpine , where vinpocetine inhibited cytokine production induced by increased neuronal activity [ 67 ] .
the antioxidant effects of vinpocetine described in cerebral isolated nerve endings are similar to those of alpha - tocopherol , a classical antioxidant [ 10 ] .
considering its high permeability through the blood - brain barrier [ 68 ] , it is possible that vinpocetine is acting at the spinal level to inhibit nf - kappab activation , pro - inflammatory mediator production and oxidative stress , thereby preventing the resulting central sensitization .
alternatively , given that peripheral carrageenan injection induces cx3cl1 production by neurons , which activates satellite glial cells to release tnf - alpha and il - beta around the dorsal root ganglion that contributes to nociceptor sensitization [ 69 ] , the peripheral inhibition of inflammation by vinpocetine may result in reduced activation ( oxidative stress , cytokine production , nf - kappab activation ) in the spinal cord .
additionally , vinpocetine has direct neuronal effects that could also reduce the nociceptive inputs , including blocking the retrograde axoplasmic transport of nerve growth factor , which is proposed as its analgesic mechanism of action in neuropathic pain [ 21 ] .
vinpocetine also blocks nav1.8 sodium currents [ 19,70 - 73 ] , being another means whereby it may act directly to inhibit nociceptor activation .
in fact , we observed that vinpocetine reduced the first phase ( 0 - 5 min ) of the formalin test , which is considered a neurogenic phase [ 43,74 ] , with the second phase depending on hyperalgesic inflammatory mediators .
one important step during inflammation - triggered hyperalgesia is increased intracellular calcium levels in nociceptors [ 75 ] , which vinpocetine may achieve by reducing sodium currents - induced intracellular calcium level increases , as shown by previous data in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells [ 76 ] .
moreover , systemic treatment with vinpocetine delays the reaction time of naive mice in the hot plate test [ 20 ] and reduces oxidative stress levels in rat brain [ 12 ] , suggesting that supraspinal mechanisms are also involved .
such data is in concordance with the more pronounced effects of vinpocetine to reduce thermal hyperalgesia , as reported here .
vinpocetine is also known as a phosphodiasterase - 1 ( pde - 1 ) inhibitor , which degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( camp ) [ 77 ] .
increasing cgmp levels is an analgesic mechanism of nitric oxide donors , as well as of analgesics in clinical use [ 78,79 ] .
tnf - alpha and il - 1beta induce pge2 production , which is ultimately responsible for nociceptor sensitization and hyperalgesia development in the carrageenan model [ 80,81 ] .
pge2 activates ep3 and ep4 receptors increasing camp and pka to induce hyperalgesia [ 82 ] .
moreover , pkcepsilon is also activated by increased camp levels in nociceptive neurons and contributes to the hyperalgesia induced [ 83 ] .
as such , increasing neuronal camp levels would not be likely to contribute to the analgesic effects of vinpocetine .
on the other hand , increasing camp in tissue resident cells such as macrophages can reduce inflammation by , for instance , inducing receptor shedding [ 84 ] and inhibiting cytokine production [ 85 ] .
additionally , it must be pointed out that vinpocetine also directly activates the large - conductance calcium - activated potassium channels ( bkca ) in neurons and neuroendocrine cells , which contribute to membrane hyperpolarization and thus also represents a possible analgesic mechanism of vinpocetine [ 86 ] .
as such , it remains to be determined as to the contribution of pde - 1 and bkca channels to the analgesic effect of vinpocetine .
it is noteworthy that vinpocetine inhibits tnf - alpha - and lps - induced inflammatory mediators and nf - kappab activation by targeting ikappab kinase ( ikk ) activity in a variety of cell lines , as well as in models of lung inflammation [ 9 ] .
in this same study , ic86340 , a highly selective pde - 1 inhibitor did not affect tnf - alpha - induced nf - kappab activation or ikk activity .
furthermore , tnf - alpha - induced ikk activity , ikappab phosphorilation and ikappab degradation were not affected by nifedipine ( ca2 + channel blocker ) , egta ( extracellular ca2 + chelator ) , 1,2 - bis ( o - aminophenoxy ) ethane - n,n,n ' , n ' - tetraacetic acid tetra ( acetoxymethyl ) ester ( bapta / am ; an intracellular ca2 + chelator ) and tetrotodotoxin ( na + channel inhibitor ) in rat vascular smooth muscle cells [ 9 ] .
additionally , although there is evidence that vinpocetine inhibits pde - 4 , it did not inhibit pde - 4 as effectively as rolipram , a classical pde - 4 inhibitor with anti - inflammatory effects [ 9,87 ] .
therefore , despite reports indicating that vinpocetine inhibits pde - 1 , pde - 4 , ca2 + and na + channels [ 18,19,37,66,71 - 73,88 ] , none of these mechanisms participated in the anti - inflammatory effects of vinpocetine that involve targeting ikk activity that consequently attenuates nf - kappab activity , suggesting that there may be other novel vinpocetine mechanism ( s ) of action [ 9 ] .
finally , it is important to highlight that vinpocetine exhibits gastric protective [ 89 ] and antidepressant [ 20,90 ] effects , suggesting that vinpocetine is a highly promising and safe candidate treatment for the clinical management of inflammation and pain , thereby improving patients' quality of life .
conclusions vinpocetine inhibited inflammatory pain by targeting nf - kappab activation and the nf - kappab - driven transcriptional consequences , including cytokine production and oxidative stress , both peripherally in the paw skin and centrally in the spinal cord .
therefore , given that vinpocetine is already in clinical use as a nootropic drug with a good safety profile , it will be important to further investigate its utility and mechanism ( s ) of action as an analgesic .

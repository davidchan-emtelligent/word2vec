the outcome of acupuncture on hypertension treatment is inconclusive .
this study aims to evaluate the influence of acupuncture on hypertension , based on findings from mechanistic studies over the course of decades particularly those conducted at the university of california , irvine .
low - current and low - frequency electroacupuncture ( ea ) at p5 - 6 ( overlying the median nerve ) and s36 - 37 ( overlying the deep peroneal nerve ) reduced high blood pressure in a subset of patients (~ 70 %) with mild - to - moderate hypertension , in a slow - onset ( 4 - 8 weeks ) but long - lasting ( 1 - 2 months ) manner .
ea inhibited cardiovascular sympathoexcitatory neurons through activation of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus , the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray in the midbrain and the nucleus raphe pallidus in the medulla , through inhibiting the activity of premotor sympathetic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla ( rvlm ) .
several neurotransmitters such as glutamate , acetylcholine , opioids , gaba , nociceptin , serotonin and endocannabinoids were involved in this ea - induced hypotensive response .
the long - lasting inhibition of hypertension induced by ea was related to opioids and gaba in the rvlm , neural circuitry between the arcuate and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray , and prolongation of the increase in preproenkephalin mrna levels and enkephalin levels in the rvlm and arcuate .
moreover , the long - lasting inhibition of sympathetic activity by ea was confirmed in ea - treated hypertensive patients with decreased levels of norepinephrine , renin and aldosterone .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background hypertension is the most common chronic disorder , affecting approximately one billion individuals worldwide [ 1 ] .
nearly one - third of the us adult population is hypertensive , and the lifetime risk of developing hypertension approaches 90 % [ 2 ] .
there are many antihypertensive medications , but these have adverse side effects .
drug therapy indiscriminately blocks many receptors that lead to a multiplicity of side effects [ 3 , 4 ] .
consequently , there is growing interest in alternative medical treatments such as acupuncture , which may complement , and offer a potential alternative to , pharmacological therapy [ 5 ] .
despite the increasing worldwide interest in acupuncture [ 6 , 7 ] , many western physicians are reluctant to recommend acupuncture , owing to its controversial mechanism of action in hypertension treatment and the unclear physiological mechanisms underlying its hypotensive effect [ 8 ] .
a number of clinical reports have suggested that acupuncture reduces blood pressure ( bp ) [ 9 - 18 ] .
however , in 2004 , the stop hypertension with acupuncture research program ( sharp ) trial concluded that acupuncture could not decrease bp [ 19 ] .
the acupuncture treatments used in that study included stimulation at many acupoints that have not been experimentally shown to be effective in reducing elevated bp in a standardized treatment group .
moreover , 24 - h measurement of systolic and diastolic bps with an ambulatory bp monitor was not performed .
recent reviews have concluded that acupuncture may lower bp in patients on antihypertensive medications , but that acupuncture alone does not decrease high bp [ 20 ] .
conversely , other clinical reports have shown that acupuncture can reduce bp [ 20 - 22 ] .
there are many weaknesses in these prior clinical studies , including small sample sizes , insufficient randomization , lack of adequate control groups [ 23 ] and the use of meridian and qi hypotheses in place of modern scientific principles [ 3 , 19 ] .
additionally , few studies monitored bp continuously ( 24 - h bp monitoring ) and , in most studies , the patients were on antihypertensive medications .
in some studies , the period of follow - up after acupuncture treatment was not long enough [ 24 ] .
thus , rigorously and properly designed clinical trials to evaluate the influence of acupuncture on hypertension are required .
this commentary will focus on issues that should be considered in a rigorous and properly designed clinical study .
( 1 ) does the study examine manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture ( ea ) ?
( 2 ) which effective and control acupoints should be used ?
( 3 ) what stimulation parameters should be studied ?
( 4 ) what is the best duration of treatment ?
( 5 ) for how long should we perform follow up after treatment ?
these aspects of acupuncture are important issues in determining the efficacy of acupuncture .
our findings to date show a significant bp - lowering effect of acupuncture .
we use standardized sets of acupuncture acupoints that have been shown to display specific underlying mechanisms to inhibit sympathetic activity and lower elevated bp [ 25 - 29 ]. by contrast , in studies that use many acupoints to treat symptoms related to hypertension - such as headache , dizziness , anxiety , constipation , insomnia , and lack of appetite , the outcomes and effects of treatment are more complicated .
therefore , efforts to treat hypertensive patients should be based on experimental laboratory findings .
acupoint specificity chinese medicine ( cm ) describes 12 bilateral and eight extra meridians that connect internal splanchnic organs to external regions on the extremities and body trunk in the theory of " meridians and collaterals " .
this theory suggests that meridians and collaterals are pathways for qi. according to modern scientific concepts , the meridian serves an integrative function through the sensory and ultimately the autonomic nervous systems and may also influence the endocrine and immune systems in cm [ 25 , 30 ] .
in modern medical concepts , the mode of action of acupuncture is influenced by central processing and integration of peripheral afferents originating from the splanchnic organs and somatic nerves ( see below ) [ 8 , 25 ] .
however , the mechanisms of action of acupuncture in the treatment of essential hypertension are not yet fully understood , and thus , require further investigation .
a number of scientists have doubted acupoint specificity because acupuncture releases opioids systemically , and these have the potential to exert widespread actions .
for example , acupoint specificity was shown with respect to stimulation of the visual cortex [ 31 ] .
however , this publication was later withdrawn [ 32 ] because the authors could not confirm acupuncture point specificity with regard to its analgesic effect .
to explore this concept , we examined the effectiveness of activating different acupuncture points on reflex - induced increases in bp by performing stimulation of visceral nerves in cats [ 33 ] .
stimulation of visceral sensory fibers activated sympathoexcitatory cardiovascular premotor sympathetic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla ( rvlm ) resulting in an increase in bp. we also evaluated acupoint specificity by performing extracellular recordings of neurons in the hypothalamus .
stimulation of various acupoints differentially activated arcuate neurons [ 32 ] .
the neurons in the arcuate receive more inputs from nerves underlying acupoints at p5 - 6 ( neiguan - jianshi , overlying the median nerve ) , s36 - 37 ( zusanli - shangjuxu , overlying the deep peroneal nerve ) , li4 - 11 ( hegu - quchi , overlying the branch of median nerve and deep radial nerve ) , h5 - 7 ( tongli - shenmen , overlying the ulnar nerve ) , and s2 - g2 ( sibai - tinghui , overlying the cranial nerves : the branch of the trigeminal nerve and the branch of the facial nerve ) than they do from nerves underlying acupoints at li6 - 7 ( pianli - wenliu , overlying the superficial radial nerve ) and g37 - 39 ( guanming - xuanzhong , overlying the superficial peroneal nerve ) .
conversely , we observed that ea at li6 - 7 ( pianli - wenliu ) and k1 - b 67 ( yongquan - zhiyin , superficial medial plantar and digital nerves ) does not influence elevated bp. however , ea at p5 - 6 , s36 - 37 , and li10 - 11 ( shousanli - quchi , overlying the deep radial nerve ) was most effective in its influence on cardiovascular function [ 8 , 34 ] .
ea at these acupoints and direct stimulation of deep or cutaneous nerves underneath these acupoints also produced similar point - specific results in models of gallbladder - evoked increased bp [ 26 ] .
therefore , we treated hypertensive patients with acupuncture at p5 - 6 + s36 - 37 as effective acupoints and at li6 - 7 + g37 - 39 as control acupoints .
manual acupuncture and electroacupuncture in the rat model of reflex - induced hypertension , ea and manual acupuncture ( ma ) matched for frequency induced similar cardiovascular responses [ 28 , 29 ] .
we have shown that ea at p5 - 6 , h5 - 7 ( overlying the ulnar nerve ) , or s36 - 37 with low current ( 2 ma ) and frequency ( 2 hz ) for 30 min inhibited the reflex increase in bp for 30 - 40 min .
manual acupuncture decreased elevated bp similarly , while sham acupuncture involving needle insertion without manipulation at p5 - 6 or li6 - 7 acupoints did not attenuate gastric distension - induced increases in bp. thus , sham acupuncture can serve as a control for ea studies [ 35 , 36 ] .
we use ea because it is a standardized treatment and induces less injury to the receptors and nerve endings underneath the acupoints .
stimulation parameters previous studies using compound action potential recording techniques have shown that finely myelinated fibers are the predominate afferents stimulated during low - current , low - frequency ea [ 25 , 37 ] .
however , using a single afferent recording technique , we showed that both myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers were activated during stimulation ( at p5 - 6 acupoints ) of the median nerve with very low current [ 26 ]. of the 62 fibers recorded , 37 % were unmyelinated ( c fibers <= 2.5 m / s ) and 63 % were myelinated ( adelta fibers > 2.5 m / s ) .
we used motor threshold as a guide to achieve similar stimulus intensities between animals used to examine the effects of ea [ 26 ] .
thus , both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers likely participate in the cardiovascular responses to acupuncture .
we also examined the importance of c fibers during ea using neonatal capsaicin - treated rats [ 38 ] depletion of substance p from unmyelinated afferent c - fibers reduced responsiveness to ea modulation of gastric distention - induced bp increases .
thus , inhibition of the cardiovascular excitatory reflex by ea at p5 - 6 requires , at least in part , input from unmyelinated c fibers .
we found that low - frequency and low - current ea optimally influenced reflex - induced hypertension [ 28 , 29 ] .
increasing ea stimulation frequency to 40 or 100 hz resulted in less , or even no , inhibition of the increase in bp. moreover , 100 - hz stimulation induced minimal input to premotor sympathetic neurons in the rvlm .
we observed a reciprocal relationship between the frequency of stimulation and ea - related afferent responses [ 28 ] .
therefore , when we treat hypertensive patients , we only use low - current , low - frequency ea. stimulation duration usually , optimal acupuncture therapeutic effects can be achieved following an average of 30 min of stimulation [ 27 , 39 - 41 ] .
in animal experiments , the effect of ea was maintained for about 1 h after the end of ea application [ 8 , 30 , 31 , 47 , 67 - 69 ] .
ea stimulation for 20 - 40 min activated long - loop pathways in the brain and induced the release of a number of neurotransmitters , including gamma - aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) , serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine , 5 - ht ) , acetylcholine , nociceptin , beta - endorphin , enkephalins , and endocannabinoids in the hypothalamus , midbrain and medulla [ 8 ] .
thus , a single application of approximately 30 min of ea is necessary to achieve prolonged and optimal modulation of cardiovascular function .
however , some acupuncturists and researchers applied acupuncture for brief periods only , often < 1 min , and observed decreases in bp and heart rate [ 29 ] .
in this regard , short - term somatic nerve stimulation induced the somatosensory reflex that influences bp and heart rate [ 42 ] .
the hemodynamic responses to these forms of stimulation operate via different mechanisms from those that underlie the effects of more prolonged stimulation. with brief stimulation , hemodynamic responses returned to normal within a few minutes [ 43 ] .
to observe a clinical effect in hypertensive patients , we apply weekly 30 - min ea for 8 weeks .
clinical studies studies in healthy subjects ea applied to healthy subjects at rest does not change bp or heart rate [ 40 ] , and ea inhibited exercise stress - induced increases in systolic and mean bps ( sbp and mbp ) as well as the double product ( sbp x heart rate , an index of myocardial oxygen demand ) [ 33 ] in ~ 70 % of healthy humans , without significant change of diastolic bp ( dbp ) .
in contrast , ea at control acupoints g37 - 39 did not significantly alter exercise stress - related increases in bp or the double product suggesting that ea at certain acupoints ( e.g. , p5 - 6 ) reduced sympathoexcitatory reflex - induced increases in bp. effects of ea on hypertensive patients the acupoints and parameters of ea that most effectively reduce sbp / dbp in patients with mild - to - moderate hypertension ( bp 140 - 180 / 90 - 110 mmhg ) were studied in a single - blinded randomized clinical trial [ 28 ] .
a group of 35 hypertensive patients without medication were given ea at p5 - 6 and s36 - 37 , once weekly for 30 min , for 8 weeks , and assessed with 24 - h ambulatory bp monitoring .
after 8 weeks of treatment , ~ 70 % of patients ( responders ) demonstrated significant reductions in peak and average sbp / 24 h. dbp / 24 h was also decreased .
heart rate was unchanged .
after termination of ea treatment , sbp remained reduced for 4 weeks , but after 8 weeks returned to near pretreatment levels .
about 30 % of patients did not respond to the ea treatment ( non - responders ) .
in 32 patients treated at control acupoints ( li6 - 7 + g37 - 39 ) , neither sbp / 24 h nor dbp / 24 h were reduced .
after 8 weeks of ea treatment , the changes in sbp ( p = 0.031 ) and dbp ( p = 0.031 ) were significantly different between the two groups ( student 's t test ) .
this beneficial effect of ea was slow in onset but long - lasting [ 41 ] .
our recent data also showed that ea weekly for 8 weeks decreased the plasma levels of catecholamine , renin and aldosterone in hypertensive patients who responded to ea treatment [ 28 ] .
these plasma hormones did not change in patients who did not respond well to the treatment [ 28 ] .
the mechanism of action of acupuncture is mainly related to the integrative function of the central nervous system at specific points in reducing elevated bp ; this function inhibits sympathetic activity and the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , and principally decreases sbp .
mechanisms of acupuncture : central nervous system and neurotransmitter studies the role of rvlm in the cardiovascular response to acupuncture the rvlm is a critical source of premotor sympathetic neurons that regulates sympathetic outflow to the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord [ 41 , 42 ] .
the rvlm was found to be indispensable for ea - mediated inhibition of defense reaction - induced elevations in bp during stimulation of hypothalamic or midbrain defense areas using morphological ( horseradish peroxidase ) and electrophysiological techniques .
iontophoresis of morphine inhibited the evoked excitation of rvlm premotor sympathetic neurons , while naloxone reversed ea - related inhibition of the activated neurons .
these authors '( dr. li 's group in shanghai ) data also suggested an opioid mechanism underlying the effects of acupuncture in the rvlm [ 44 - 46 ] .
acupuncture did not influence bp under normal physiological conditions , such as in normotensive subjects [ 34 ] .
as such , the mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture were examined under conditions of elevated sympathetic activity , such as brief and sustained hypertension [ 47 , 48 ] .
using in vivo experiments , various mechanisms of action of acupuncture were investigated revealing the following : ( 1 ) ea at select acupoints such as neiguan - jianshi along the pericardial meridian ( p5 - 6 ) reduces sympathoexcitatory - related increases in bp [ 26 , 49 ] ; ( 2 ) ea induces a beneficial effect by reversing demand - induced myocardial ischemia through its reduction of myocardial oxygen demand [ 26 ] ; ( 3 ) ea induces inhibition of evoked premotor sympathetic rvlm neuronal discharge [ 33 , 34 ] ; and ( 4 ) the long - lasting inhibitory effect of acupuncture persists during and after the application of ea for at least 1 h [ 50 ] .
microinjection or iontophoresis of naloxone or gabazine , an antagonist of gabaa receptors , into the rvlm , reduced the prolonged ea - mediated inhibition of reflex - induced neuronal activity and bp increases [ 34 , 50 ] .
ea specifically inhibited elevated bp and rvlm activity through activation of micro and delta opioid receptors , but not kappa opioid receptors in the rvlm [ 51 ] .
we also showed that low - frequency and low - intensity ea induced c - fos expression in enkephalinergic rvlm neurons [ 52 ] .
we have examined point specificity in rvlm neurons characterized as cardiovascular and sympathoexcitatory .
these rvlm neurons processed somatic input during acupuncture stimulation [ 33 , 36 , 45 ] at p5 - 6 and li4 - 11 acupoints , along the large intestine meridian , and provided more convergent afferent inputs to cardiovascular premotor sympathetic neurons in the rvlm than did cardiovascular inactive points ( li6 - 7 , g37 - 39 ) suggesting a point - specific integration in the central nervous system [ 33 ] .
hypothalamic and midbrain nuclei in the acupuncture response the hypothalamus and midbrain are involved in the action of ea in modulating elevated bp responses [ 46 , 53 ] .
the blockade of glutamatergic receptors in the arcuate nucleus reversed ea - induced inhibition of sympathoexcitatory responses , confirming the critical role of this nucleus in acupuncture [ 54 , 55 ] .
the neurons in the arcuate nucleus are rich in endorphins and project directly to the rvlm , suggesting they might activate micro - opioid receptors and consequently inhibited rvlm neurons [ 56 ] .
the beta - endorphinergic arcuate neurons might be involved in the inhibitory action of ea on cardiovascular excitatory responses [ 27 , 55 ] .
we also evaluated the role of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray ( vlpag ) and its interaction with the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus in ea - induced cardiovascular sympathoexcitatory responses [ 54 - 56 ] and whether excitatory projections from the arcuate to the vlpag and vice versa are essential for ea inhibition of sympathoexcitatory cardiovascular bp responses .
the neurons in the arcuate and vlpag with low spontaneous activity ( 4 - 5 impulse / s ) responded to both visceral and acupoint - somatic afferent stimulation [ 55 ] .
these neurons also responded to baroreceptor input and displayed frequency discharges correlated with the cardiac cycle , displaying strong cardiac rhythmicity .
these neurons showed gradation of responses to stimulation of different acupoints , providing a cellular basis for point - specific responses .
in this respect , evoked responses in both the arcuate and vlpag were the greatest during stimulation of the p5 - 6 , li4 - 11 , h5 - 7 , and s2 - g2 acupoints compared with the responses during stimulation of li6 - 7 and g37 - 39 .
these neurons responsive to ea enhanced evoked activity in the arcuate nucleus and vlpag .
phenotypical enkephalinergic cells in the vlpag , which are activated by ea , express c - fos [ 52 ] .
endorphinergic arcuate nucleus projections combined with enkephalinergic vlpag and reciprocal projections comprise , in part , the long - loop pathway that eventually inhibit rvlm neurons , and which is critical for the sympathoinhibition occurring during electroacupuncture [ 27 , 57 ] .
this long - loop pathway in ea inhibition involves a number of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters .
these neurotransmitters specific to cardiovascular nuclei include glutamate , acetylcholine in the arcuate nucleus , endocannabinoids and gaba ( gamma - aminobutyric acid ) in the vlpag , serotonin in the nucleus raphe obscurus and the nucleus raphe pallidus ( nrp ) , and opioids and gaba in the rvlm , among others [ 35 , 44 , 53 , 55 , 56 ] .
role of the spinal cord in the cardiovascular response to acupuncture reflex responses to activation of somatic and visceral afferents are integrated into cardiovascular supraspinal regions and the spinal cord .
the spinal cord relays outputs from the central nervous system to effector organs involved in cardiovascular reflex regulation [ 58 ] .
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord is a major center for ea - induced analgesia [ 59 ] .
the number of c - fos - immunoreactive neurons is increased by both low - and high - frequency ea at the zusanli ( s36 ) acupoint in the superficial laminae ( i and ii ) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord [ 59 ] .
moreover , opioid and nociceptin - like immunoreactivities are present in the spinal sympathetic nuclei ( intermediolateral column , iml ) [ 60 , 61 ] .
therefore , we investigated the spinal mechanism of action of ea in sympathoexcitatory cardiovascular responses .
nociceptin and opioids in the dorsal horn and iml of the spinal cord reduced the response to rvlm - induced sympathoexcitation or visceral induced reflex responses suggesting that these neurotransmitters acted on sympathetic outflow [ 62 ] .
this study also showed that nociceptin functions independently from opioids in mediating the effects of acupuncture .
descending pathways from the brain stem influenced the segmental processing of somatic inputs during ea [ 61 , 63 ] .
furthermore , stimulation of specific dermatomes with somatic nerve stimulation elicited excitatory and inhibitory responses in both iml and dorsal horn interneurons [ 64 ] .
these interneurons link in the spinal cord circuitry underlying autonomic control [ 65 ] .
opioids and nociceptin could be involved in the activity of interneurons in the spinal cord during the ea response .
long - lasting effect of acupuncture thirty minutes of ea application induced a significant and immediate post - stimulation short - term reduction in dbp [ 66 ] .
in a small study of 50 patients with essential hypertension , chiu et al .
[ 23 ] administered acupuncture for > 30 min , both sbp and dbp were lowered by 10 - 20 mmhg .
in conscious animals ( dogs and spontaneous hypertensive rats ) ea modulated bp for 1 - 12 h [ 67 - 69 ] .
ea - induced inhibition of the cardiovascular excitatory reflex response lasted between 1 and 6 h in anesthetized rabbits , rats , and cats [ 26 , 49 , 69 , 70 ] .
in anesthetized animals , ea inhibits sympathoexcitatory cardiovascular premotor rvlm neuronal activity for over 1 h after cessation of ea [ 34 , 45 ] .
the initial occlusive interaction of somatic and visceral convergent afferent input in rvlm is very short - lived , while prolonged stimulation of somatic afferents ( 30 min ea ) leads to long - lasting inhibition of visceral - evoked neuronal responses .
thus , inhibition of cardiovascular function by acupuncture is based on 30 min of somatic afferent - evoked rvlm activity influencing central regulation of sympathoexcitatory responses [ 34 ] .
neurotransmitter specificity this prolonged inhibition effect of ea on rvlm sympathetic premotor neuronal responses to excitatory visceral input involves specific neurotransmitters .
in particular , opioids and gaba but not nociceptin are important in the inhibition of rvlm sympathetic premotor neurons during this long - lasting ea effect [ 50 ] .
non - responsiveness to acupuncture treatment occurred in about 30 % of subjects , and an ea analgesic response occurred in about 70 % of patients [ 71 , 72 ] .
similar acupuncture effectiveness in terms of sympathoexcitatory cardiovascular responses [ 40 , 73 ] and effects on hypertension [ 41 ] were observed .
we investigated the neurotransmitter that antagonizes the actions of opioids , and found that , within the rvlm , cholecystokinin 8 reversed the effects of ea , while blockade of its receptor converted an ea non - responsive subject to an ea responder [ 73 ] .
neurotransmitter mechanisms might be involved in the effectiveness of acupuncture .
long - loop pathway the hypothalamus , midbrain and medulla participate in the prolonged action of acupuncture .
microinjection of kainic acid into the hypothalamic region blocked ea - mediated inhibition of reflex - induced hypertension [ 27 ] .
prolonged inhibition of rvlm neurons by ea requires an intact arcuate nucleus [ 27 , 55 ] .
reciprocal excitatory projections between the arcuate nucleus and the vlpag [ 74 ] prolonged ea - cardiovascular regulation for 30 - 60 min [ 8 ] .
meanwhile , projections from the vlpag to the nrp and then the rvlm contributed to the serotonin - induced inhibition of rvlm neurons [ 57 , 75 , 76 ] .
inhibition of sympathoexcitation with acupuncture is long - lasting and involves the arcuate nucleus , vlpag , nrp and rvlm , which are important sites of neurotransmitter opioid synthesis .
opioid mrna expression prolonged inhibition of bp increases lasts for several days in patients with mild - to - moderate hypertension .
in this respect , although limited in scope , studies have suggested that acupuncture may induce increased expression of mrnas for opioid precursors in the brain for a period of 24 - 72 h [ 77 , 78 ] .
recent data from our laboratory using real - time pcr demonstrated that the level of preproenkephalin in the rvlm is increased by 90 min after completion of a single 30 - min application of ea at p5 - 6 acupoints in rats [ 79 ] .
moreover , conscious rats treated with repeated ea express higher levels of preproenkephalin for > 24 h while the concentration of enkephalin in the rvlm is elevated for 48 h [ 80 ] .
the roles of opioid mrna expression and other neurotransmitter precursors , as well as the neurotransmitters released in the hypothalamus , midbrain , and other regions of the medulla , particularly in studies involving repetitive ea in sympathoexcitatory conditions , are worthy of further investigation .
endocrine and vascular actions of acupuncture a previous study showed that 8 weeks of ea treatment at 350 hz delayed development of hypertension and restored nitric oxide levels in the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats [ 81 ] .
additionally , prolonged intermittent stimulation for 2 h ea at s36 at 3 hz induced nnos expression in the gracile nucleus and medial nucleus tractus solitaries [ 82 ] , suggesting that nnos may participate in the effects of acupuncture on central cardiovascular regulation .
acupuncture reduces bp through a modulation of the endocrine system that includes decreases in plasma renin , angiotensin ii and aldosterone [ 14 , 17 , 23 ] , and increases in the excretion of sodium [ 83 ] .
our recent clinical data show that ea weekly for 8 weeks decreased plasma levels of catecholamine , renin , and aldosterone in hypertensive patients who responded to ea treatment , but not in ea non - responders .
thus , these preliminary data suggest that the long - lasting ea - induced inhibition of hypertension is related to the inhibition of sympathetic activity , in particular , renal sympathetic nerves .
the decreases in the release of renin , angiotensin , and aldosterone suggest an increase in the excretion of sodium and water that leads to a decrease in blood volume and reduced sbp .
additional studies are needed to confirm these findings .
limitations of this commentary this article discusses over 23 articles of meta - analyses and clinical studies that largely provide inconclusive findings .
the intention of this article is not to sum up all acupuncture studies , but to identify areas of concern and aspects that are important in determining the effectiveness of acupuncture to treat hypertension .
we have not investigated a priori how ea alters the renin - angiotensin and aldosterone systems in our experimental investigation .
our preliminary clinical data indicate that ea alters plasma hormones after 8 weeks with weekly treatment at p5 - 6 + s36 - 37 in mild - to - moderate hypertensive patients .
we also do not know if acupuncture alters parasympathetic activity in hypertensive subjects .
although our current ongoing clinical study showed that ea does not influence heart rate , we showed that ea increased parasympathetic activity during reflex responses .
moreover , in our clinical study , we only used p5 - 6 + s36 - 37 acupoints to treat hypertension .
we have not examined other acupoints used by other acupuncturists in treating symptoms related to hypertension .
acupoints such as li11 , li4 , and other acupoints located on the head also project to the arcuate nucleus and may inhibit sympathetic activity and reduce hypertension .
furthermore , questions remain around how frequently patients should be treated to gain the maximum effect of acupuncture .
thus , we do not know if ea could reduce high bp significantly faster if applied twice or more per week to hypertensive patients .
these issues require further study .
thus , although we have shown that ea modulates both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in inhibitory cardiovascular responses , it is unclear if acupuncture also alters both nervous systems in hypertensive subjects .
summary and prospects low - current and low - frequency ea at p5 - 6 and s36 - 37 reduced high blood pressure in a subset of patients ( about 70 %) with mild to moderate hypertension , and the effect showed a slow onset ( 4 - 8 weeks ) but was long - lasting ( 1 - 2 months ) .
ea inhibited cardiovascular sympathoexcitatory neurons through activation of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus , the vlpag in the midbrain and the nrp in the medulla , which in turn , inhibited the activity of premotor sympathetic neurons in the rvlm to reduce blood pressure .
the arcuate also projects to the rvlm and contains endorphin .
the neurotransmitters glutamate , acetylcholine , opioids , gaba , nociceptin , serotonin and endocannabinoids all participate in the ea hypotensive response , although their importance varies between nuclei .
the long - lasting inhibition of ea is related to opioids and gaba in the rvlm , neural circuitry between the arcuate and vlpag , and prolongation of the increase in preproenkephalin mrna and enkephalin expression in the rvlm and arcuate .
the inhibition of sympathetic activity , renin , angiotensin and aldosterone may also be quite important .
thus , a number of mechanisms underlying the long - lasting effect of ea on cardiovascular function have been suggested , but further investigation is warranted .
acupuncture modulated low blood pressure and heart rate and ea influenced both sympathoinhibitory and parasympathoexcitatory reflex responses [ 84 - 87 ] , suggesting that ea might restore the activity of the autonomic nervous system during suboptimal conditions .
the spinal cord circuitry controlling the cardiovascular visceral reflex responses during ea requires further elucidation .
conclusion the action of ea might be related to the activation of opioid system in the brain and inhibition of sympathetic activity and renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system .
future studies are required to improve our understanding of this mechanism .

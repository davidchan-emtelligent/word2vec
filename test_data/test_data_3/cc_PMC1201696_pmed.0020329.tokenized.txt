increased expression in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of capon in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder schizophrenia and bipolar disease are complex diseases , with multiple genes and environmental factors thought to be responsible for their manifestation .
many reports have implicated changes in certain regions of the human genome in schizophrenia .
an area on chromosome 1 has been associated with the disease in different studies and populations .
linda brzustowicz and colleagues had previously described association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) within a gene called capon ( for carboxyl - terminal pdz ligand of neuronal nitric oxide synthase ) with schizophrenia in a set of canadian families .
a separate study in a chinese population found an association between schizophrenia and a separate group of snps within capon .
capon is an attractive candidate for a " schizophrenia gene " : capon was first identified as a protein binding to neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nnos ) , and indirect evidence suggests that it might be linked to the regulation of glutamate neurotransmission .
however , so far , no coding sequence mutations in capon have been found in patients with schizophrenia .
brzustowicz and colleagues now report results from a study of capon expression in postmortem brain samples from patients with schizophrenia , from patients with bipolar disorder , and from control individuals without psychiatric illness .
initially screening a human fetal brain cdna library for potential alternative splice forms of capon , they found , in addition to the predicted full - length transcript , a shorter isoform that consists of the last two exons of the gene .
they also confirmed that both long and short versions of the protein are present in human brain .
( the short isoform would still be able to bind nnos and possibly disrupt its interaction with other proteins. ) the authors then examined capon mrna expression in postmortem brain samples from 35 patients with schizophrenia , from 35 patients with bipolar disorder , and from 35 controls .
they looked for transcripts encoding the long and short forms and also compared expression levels ( relative to beta - actin ) across the diagnostic groups .
in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( thought to be involved in schizophrenia and the only area for which samples were available ) , expression levels of the long isoform did not differ between patient and control samples .
however , the short isoform was expressed at higher levels in the patients with mental illness than in the controls .
they also analyzed dna from these individuals at three snps associated with schizophrenia and found , for each snp , that the group of individuals who carried one or two copies of the schizophrenia - associated allele had overall higher levels of the short form transcript than those homozygous for the non - associated capon allele .
they saw no differences in levels of the full - length transcript between the groups with different snp genotypes .
these are intriguing but preliminary results .
getting reliable results from studies on postmortem samples is extremely difficult because of numerous confounding factors .
brzustowicz and colleagues tried to control for some of them ( such as sex of the individual , substance abuse by the individual , and storage time of the sample ) , but others are impossible to determine or control for .
moreover , this particular collection of samples had only tissue from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex available for study .
sample preparation was geared toward high - quality rna for expression studies and not suitable for parallel protein analysis .
future studies , with at least some of them in animal models that allow controlled conditions and experimentation , will need to determine the functions of the long and short isoforms of capon and their interaction with other proteins involved in postsynaptic neurotransmission ( some of which have also been linked to schizophrenia ) , and elucidate a possible role for capon in psychiatric disorders .

urea is the degradation product of a wide range of nitrogen containing bio - molecules .
urea amidolyase ( ua ) catalyzes the conversion of urea to ammonium , the essential first step in utilizing urea as a nitrogen source .
it is widely distributed in fungi , bacteria and other microorganisms , and plays an important role in nitrogen recycling in the biosphere .
ua is composed of urea carboxylase ( uc ) and allophanate hydrolase ( ah ) domains , which catalyze sequential reactions .
in some organisms uc and ah are encoded by separated genes .
we present here structure of the kluyveromyces lactis ua ( klua ) .
the structure revealed that klua forms a compact homo - dimer with a molecular weight of 400 kda .
structure inspired biochemical experiments revealed the mechanism of its reaction intermediate translocation , and that the klua holo - enzyme formation is essential for its optimal activity .
interestingly , previous studies and ours suggest that uc and ah encoded by separated genes probably do not form a klua - like complex , consequently they might not catalyze the urea to ammonium conversion as efficiently .
biotin crystallography hydrolases nitrogen metabolism urea amidolyase introduction degradation of a wide range of nitrogen - containing bio - molecules generates urea .
mammals do not directly utilize urea , and excrete it into the environment .
in contrast , many plants , fungi and bacteria can utilize urea as a nitrogen source [ 1 - 3 ] .
they reintegrate its nitrogen into the biosphere , playing important roles in the nitrogen recycling within the biosphere .
the first step of their urea utilization is the conversion of urea to ammonium , which is catalyzed by two distinct enzymes , urease and urea amidolyase ( ua ) [ 4 ] .
ua is widely distributed in fungi , bacteria and other microorganisms [ 5,6 ] .
in many ua containing organisms the ni2 + - dependent urease is not found , neither is the ni / co co - transporter .
these organisms might have dropped all ni - dependent pathways during evolution , and have gained a selective advantage since ni2 + can be toxic if its cellular level is not tightly regulated [ 5 ] .
in addition to urea utilization , ua also plays important roles in a recently discovered eukaryotic pyrimidine nucleic acid precursor degradation pathway [ 7 ] , and the pathogenesis of human pathogens such as candida albicans [ 8 - 10 ] .
ua is composed of urea carboxylase ( uc ) and allophanate hydrolase ( ah ) domains .
uc converts urea to allophanate , and ah subsequently converts it to ammonium [ 11 ] .
uc belongs to the biotin - dependent carboxylase family .
biotin is covalently linked to its biotin - carboxyl carrier protein ( bccp ) domain .
its biotin carboxylase ( bc ) and carboxyltransferase ( ct ) domains catalyze sequential reactions in urea caboxylation [ 12,13 ] .
the ah domain is composed of n and c domains , which catalyze sequential reactions in the allophanate to ammonium conversion [ 14 ] ( figure 1a,b ) .
in some organisms , uc and ah are encoded by separated genes [ 5,6,15,16 ] .
phylogenetic analyses suggest that the ua gene is the result of a fusion event of ah and uc genes [ 6 ] .

( b ) reactions catalyzed by ua. structural characterizations of uc [ 17 ] and ah [ 14,18,19 ] have provided insights into their catalytic mechanism .
however , the architecture of the ua holo - enzyme is not clear , how uc and ah coordinate in the holo - enzyme is poorly understood .
we present here crystal structure of kluyveromyces lactis ua ( klua ) at 6.5 a resolution .
the structure revealed that klua forms a compact dimer with a molecular weight of 400 kda .
structure guided biochemical experiments provided insights into allophanate translocation between the uc and ah domains , and indicated that the klua holo - enzyme formation is required for its optimal activity .
previous studies and ours suggest that uc and ah encoded by separated genes probably do not form a klua - like complex .
consequently , they probably catalyze the urea to ammonium conversion less efficiently .
experimental procedures protein expression and purification the klua gene was amplified from the kluyveromyces lactis genome , and inserted into vector pet28a ( novagen ) .
to generate the kluadeltabccp construct , a stop codon was inserted after base pair 5223 .
this plasmid was transformed into escherichia coli bl21 ( de3 ) star cells , which were cultured in lb medium supplemented with 50 mg / l kanamycin , and induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl beta - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside when the optical density at 600 nm reaches 1.0 , at 16degreesc for 16 hours .
the kluadeltabccp protein was purified by nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid ( qiagen ) , anion - exchange ( hitrap q hp , ge healthcare ) and size exclusion columns ( sephacryl s300 hr , ge healthcare ) .
purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg / ml , in a buffer containing 20 mm tris / hcl ( ph 8.0 ) , 200 mm nacl , 2 mm dtt and 5 % glycerol , flash cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80degreesc .
the expression and purification of the full length klua , kluyveromyces lactis uc ( kluc ) and kluyveromyces lactis ah ( klah ) followed protocols reported previously [ 14,17 ] .
the klua mutants were generated with the quikchange kit ( agilent technologies ) and verified by dna sequencing .
the mutants were expressed and purified following the same protocol for the wild type protein .
crystallization and structure determination rod - shaped crystals were obtained with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method .
the crystallization experiments were conducted at 4degreesc , and the reservoir solution contains 0.1 m tris / hcl ( ph 7.5 ) , 0.2 m ammonium sulfate , 12 % peg 8000 , 2 % peg3350 .
before crystallization experiments the protein solution was supplemented with 0.5 mm urea , 0.5 mm adp and 0.5 mm sodium malonate ( ph 7.0 ) .
for data collection the crystals were equilibrated in the reservoir solution supplemented with 20 % glycerol , flash cooled and stored in liquid nitrogen .
diffraction data were collected at 100 k , on an adsc q315 charge - coupled device detector at the shanghai synchrotron radiation facility beamline bl17u , at a wavelength of 1.0391 a ( table 1 ) .
the data were processed with mosflm [ 20 ] and scaled with scala [ 21 ] .
the structure of kluadeltabccp was determined with molecular replacement with phaser [ 22 ] , using the structures of kluc ( pdb 3va7 ) and klah ( pdb 4iss ) as search models .
inspection and manipulation of the structure were carried out with coot [ 23 ] and o [ 24 ] .
structural refinement was carried out with phenix [ 25 ] .
mosflm , scala and phaser are programs in the ccp4 suite [ 26 ] .

following 15 minutes of incubation on ice , the samples were further diluted , applied onto glow - discharged , thin carbon - film covered copper grid ( 300 - mesh ) as 3 mul droplets .
the grids were blotted , stained with 1 % uranyl acetate for 30 seconds and observed with a fei g2 electron microscope operating at 200 kv. micrographs were recorded by so 163 films at a nominal magnification of 50000x , and scanned at 2000 dpi with a pixel size of 2.54 a .
4495 particles were manually selected using e2boxer.py [ 27 ] .
alignment and 2d classification were performed by relion [ 28 ] .
enzyme kinetic assays the ua activity was assayed by monitoring the production of ammonium , which is coupled to the nadh to nad conversion by glutamate dehydrogenase [ 29 ] .
the reaction mixture contained 100 mm tris / hcl ( ph 8.0 ) , 1 mum egta , 20 mm potassium chloride , 11 mm magnesium choloride , 5 mm atp , 12.5 mm sodium bicarbonate , 50 mm oxoglutarate , 0.3 mm nadh , 100 units / ml glutamate dehydrogenase , 0.15 mum klua or related proteins and variable concentrations of urea .
for reactions containing two proteins , 0.15 mum of each is used unless otherwise indicated .
the ah activity was assayed similarly .
the reaction mixture contained 100 mm tris / hcl ( ph8 . 0 ) , 1 mum egta , 20 mm potassium choloride , 6 mm magnesium choloride , 50 mm oxoglutarate , 0.3 mm nadh , 100 units / ml glutamate dehydrogenase , 0.05 mum klua or related proteins , and variable concentrations of potassium allophanate .
potassium allophanate was produced as described [ 16 ] .
analytical gel filtration analytical gel filtration experiments were performed on a superpose 6 hr column ( ge healthcare ) .
0.25 mg of protein samples was injected on the column , and eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm tris / hcl ( ph 8.0 ) and 200 mm nacl .
the column was calibrated with protein standards ( sigma - aldrich ) including carbonic anhydrase ( 29 kda ) , bovine serum albumin ( 66 kda ) , alcohol dehydrogenase ( 150 kda ) , beta - amylase ( 200 kda ) , apoferritin ( 443 kda ) and bovine thyroglobulin ( 669 kda ) .
results structure determination the full - length klua failed to crystallize .
we speculated that the mobility of the bccp domain prevented its crystallization , and hence removed it. this variant ( residues 1 - 1741 , kluadeltabccp ) crystallized with the vapor diffusion method .
despite extensive efforts , the best crystals only diffract to 6 - 7 a resolution at the shanghai synchrotron radiation facility .
they belong to space group p212121 and contain four copies of kluadeltabccp in the asymmetric unit .
the structure was determined with molecular replacement , using structures of kluc [ 17 ] and klah [ 14 ] as search models .
the 100 % sequence identity between the search models and the crystalized protein facilitated subsequent refinements .
the structure was refined to a resolution of 6.5 a , and agrees well with the crystallographic data , and expected geometric values ( table 1 ) .
at this resolution the structure did not reveal any significant differences between the structures of its uc and ah domains and the previously reported kluc and klah structures .
the linker between the ah and uc domains is not clearly defined in the electron density map .
however , in the crystal near each ah c - terminus only one uc n - terminus is found , indicating that they belong to the same polypeptide ( figure 2a ) .
the relative orientations of the ah and uc domains in the four kluadeltabccp protomers are very similar. with the ah domains aligned , the positions of the uc domains are related by rotations of 10degrees or less ( figure 2b ) .
there are few contacts between the uc and ah domains in the same polypeptide .

architecture of the klua holo - enzyme in the crystal the four kluadeltabccp polypeptides are organized into two very similar dimers .
the structure of the dimer resembles the letter ' m ' , with the ah domains at the center , sandwiched by the uc domains on both sides .
the two monomers are roughly related by a two - fold rotational symmetry ( figure 3a - c ) .
although the bccp domain is not present in the protein we crystallized , the structure of kluc [ 17 ] allowed us to model it onto the observed kluadeltabccp dimer .
this indicates that the bccp domains are located at opposite ends of the klua dimer ( figure 3a,b ) , which would allow it to move freely to deliver carboxyl - biotin between the bc and ct domains , consistent with its role in the catalysis .

( f ) size distribution of the observed particles .
the ratio of dimer and tetramer is calculated from a total of 613 particles in eight micrographs .
to confirm the physiological relevance of the observed dimer in the crystal , we characterized the architecture of full - length klua by negatively stained electron microscopy ( figure 3d ) .
images of mono - dispersed kiua particles were subjected to alignment and 2d classification .
the dimension and appearance of this average corresponds well to the distinctive , ' m ' - shaped projection of the dimeric kiuadeltabccp crystal structure .
however no density in the class averages could be reliably assigned to domain bccp , presumably due to its conformational flexibility ( figure 3e ) .
a small number of larger particles were also observed , and their sizes suggest that they correspond to a tetrameric form of klua .
these particles showed prominent structural variability , suggesting that they result from weak and non - specific association of the klua dimers .
the prevalence of the ' m ' - shaped particles observed in the electron microscopy visualization ( figure 3f ) suggests that full - length kiua in solution adopts a dimeric structure similar to that of kiuadeltabccp in the crystal .
interactions between the klua monomers in the klua dimer , the interactions between the monomers are located at two interfaces .
one is between the ah domains , which form a dimer identical with the isolated klah [ 14 ] ( figure 4a ) .
this interface is composed of highly conserved residues and buries 5000 a2 of surface area .
the other is between the uc ct domain and the ah n domain from the other polypeptide .
this interface is mainly contributed by helices alphah and alphai in the uc ct domain , and helix alpha3 in the ah n domain , burying 1000 a2 of surface area .
residues at this interface are not very conserved among ua from different species [ 14,17 ] ( figure 4b ) .

( d ) and ( e ) ah ( d ) and ua ( e ) activities of klua and its g559e / g572e mutant .
to probe the physiological relevance of the interface between the ah domains , we introduced the g559e / g572e mutation that renders the isolated klah monomeric [ 14 ] , and determined its effect on the klua holo - enzyme formation by analytical gel filtration experiments .
in these experiments , the full - length klua has an apparent molecular weight of 500 kda ( the molecular weight of the monomeric klua is 202 kda ) , and kluadeltabccp has an apparent molecular weight of 400 kda ( the molecular weight of the monomeric form is 190 kda , figure 4c ) , indicating that they both form homo - dimers .
in contrast , the g559e / g572e mutant appeared to be monomeric , with an apparent molecular weight of 310 kda .
therefore , the extensive interface between the ah domains is essential for the ua holo - enzyme assembly .
to assess the contribution of the uc - ah interface in the holo - enzyme formation , we tested whether isolated kluc and klah form a stable complex in solution .
kluc and klah are monomeric and dimeric in solution , respectively [ 14,17 ] .
they have similar molecular weights and elute at roughly the same volume in our analytical gel filtration experiments .
their mixture elutes at the same volume , indicating that they do not form a stable complex in solution ( figure 4c ) .
the relatively smaller uc - ah interface therefore does not play a major role in the ua holo - enzyme assembly .
in the isolated klah , the active sites are located near the dimer interface .
the extensive interactions at the dimer interface most likely stabilize the structure of the active sites .
consistent with this , the g559e / g572e mutation that renders the isolated klah monomeric severely inhibited its activity [ 14 ] .
the ah domains in klua form an identical dimer , and the g559e / g572e mutation that renders the enzyme monomeric also severely reduces its ah activity ( figure 4d and table 2 ) and its overall activity ( figure 4e and table 2 ) .
the interactions between the ah domains in the klua holo - enzyme probably also stabilize the active site structures of the ah domain , and is required for its optimal activity .

2 errors were obtained from fitting the experimental data to the michaelis - menten equation .
3 numbers in parentheses are ratios to the wild type values .
translocation of allophanate during the ua catalysis , allophanate is produced at the active site of the uc ct domain and is translocated to that of the ah n domain for subsequent reaction .
in the kluadeltabccp structure , these active sites are located more than 70 a apart .
a somewhat continuous positively charged surface patch connects these active sites in the same polypeptide ( figure 3c ) .
allophanate is negatively charged at physiological ph , and this prompted us to test if this patch mediates substrate channeling of allophanate within the same klua polypeptide , which can greatly reduce the transit time of reaction intermediates [ 30,31 ] .
if allophanate is channeled between active sites in the same klua polypeptide , only a klua polypeptide with intact uc and ah active sites can catalyze the urea to ammonium conversion .
otherwise , a ua polypeptide with defective uc activity can cooperate with one with defective ah activity for the catalysis .
to test if substrate channeling within the same klua polypeptide takes place , we mixed the k1605a and s177a mutants of klua at 1:1 molar ratio and tested if the mixture can catalyzes urea to ammonium conversion .
the conserved lys1605 side chain in the uc ct active site most likely serves as the essential general base for the ct reaction , and the k1605a mutation severely inhibited the activity of the isolated kluc [ 17 ] .
the conserved ser177 side chain hydroxyl in the ah n domain active site performs the initial nucleophilic attack on allophanate , and the s177a mutation inactivates the isolated klah [ 14 ] .
these mutations should inhibit the uc and ah activities of ua , respectively .
consistently , neither mutant was able to catalyze the urea to ammonium conversion efficiently ( figure 5a ) .
in contrast , their mixture was able to catalyze the urea to ammonium conversion as efficiently as the wild type klua ( figure 5a and table 2 ) .
therefore at least in our experiment setup , substrate channeling of allophanate within the same klua polypeptide does not play a major role .
figure 5 kinetic assays of klua and related proteins .
( a ) , ( b ) and ( d ) the ua activity of klua and related proteins / mixtures .
( c ) the ah activity of klah and full - length klua .
klua is dimeric in solution and substrate channeling of allophanate could take place between different polypeptides within the holo - enzyme .
if the dissociation and re - association of the klua dimer is rapid , mixing the k1605a and s177a mutants at 1:1 molar ratio will generate a k1605a / s177a hybrid dimer , constituting 50 % of the klua dimer population .
if allophanate is channeled between different polypeptides in the klua dimer , this is the only active dimer species , and it has to catalyze the urea to ammonium conversion twice as fast as the wild type klua to produce the effect we saw in figure 5a .
additional experiments ( see discussion ) indicate that it is not likely to be the case .
rather , figure 5a is consistent with a model that allophanate is translocated from the active site of uc ct domain to that of the ah n domain via diffusion through solvent .
the ua holo - enzyme catalyzes the urea to ammonium conversion more efficiently the klua holo - enzyme forms a tight complex .
although substrate channeling of allophanate is unlikely to take place within the klua holo - enzyme , we found that it catalyzes the urea to ammonium conversion more efficiently .
compared with the mixture of isolated kluc and klah , its catalysis is approximately 30 % faster ( figure 5b and table 2 ) .
we tested the possibility that this is due to enhanced ah or uc activities of the klua holo - enzyme .
to compare the activity of the ah domain in klua and the isolated klah , we compared the urea to ammonium conversion activity of two mixtures : one contains klua mutants s177a and k1605a , the other contains klua mutant s177a and isolated klah .
in both mixtures the same protein catalyzes the uc reaction ( klua mutant s177a ) .
in the first mixture the ah reaction is catalyzed by the ah domain in the klua k1605a holo - enzyme , whereas in the second it is catalyzed by the isolated klah .
the reaction catalyzed by the first mixture was approximately 30 % faster , indicating that the ah domain in the klua k1605a holo - enzyme is more active than the isolated klah ( figure 5b and table 2 ) .
measuring the ah activity of klua and isolated klah directly also indicates that the ah activity of klua is about 30 % stronger ( figure 5c and table 2 ) .
therefore the klua holo - enzyme enhances its ah activity .
we performed a similar experiment to compare the activities of isolated kluc and the uc domain in the klua holo - enzyme .
this experiment revealed that the urea to ammonium conversion activities of the kluc / klua k1605a and klua s177a / klua k1605a mixtures were roughly the same ( figure 5b and table 2 ) , suggesting that either the isolated kluc has the same activity as the uc domain in the klua s177a holo - enzyme , or the ah reaction is rate - limiting .
to test if the ah or the uc reaction is rate - limiting , we artificially increased the uc and ah activities by supplementing kluc and klah , respectively .
if one of these reactions is rate - limiting , increasing its activity should cause an increase in the overall ua reaction rate , whereas increasing the activity of the other should not have an effect .
the experiments revealed that increasing either the uc or the ah activities caused significant increases in the overall ua reaction rate ( figure 5d and table 2 ) , indicating that no rate - limiting step in the klua catalysis could be detected under the experimental conditions we used .
therefore , the activity of the isolated kluc is not significantly different from that of the uc domain in the klua s177a holo - enzyme .
assuming that the s177a mutation at the ah n domain active site does not affect the uc activity , these data indicate that the klua holo - enzyme formation does not affect its uc activity .
discussion our crystallographic and electron microscopic studies on klua provided a clear picture of its holo - enzyme architecture .
the formation of the dimeric klua holo - enzyme is mediated by extensive and conserved interactions between its ah domains , and relatively weaker , less conserved interactions between its uc and ah domains .
if there is no covalent linkage between the ah and uc domains , the latter is not strong enough to hold them to form a stable complex .
this suggests that ah and uc encoded by separated genes probably do not form a klua - like complex , consistent with studies on a number of such ah and uc proteins [ 16,18,32 ] .
although a continuous positively charged surface patch connects the active sites of the uc ct domain and the ah n domain in the same klua polypeptide , our data argue against a model that it mediates substrate channeling of allophanate .
instead , our data suggest that allophanate translocation is most likely via diffusion through solvent .
the klua k1605a / kluc mixture and the klua s177a / klah mixture can both catalyze the urea to ammonium conversion efficiently ( figure 5b ) .
in these mixtures the klua holo - enzyme lacks either the uc or the ah activity .
therefore translocation of allophanate within the klua holo - enzyme cannot sustain the ua catalysis , and the observed the ua activity is entirely contributed by allophanate translocation between klua and isolated kluc / klah , via diffusion through solvent .
in addition , supplementing klua with isolated kluc or klah can significantly increase the overall urea to ammonium conversion rate ( figure 5d ) , indicating that klua can take allophanate from solution ( produced by the isolated kluc ) and release it to solution ( to the isolated klah ) .
therefore , substrate channeling of allophanate within the same klua polypeptide or klua holo - enzyme is unlikely to play a role in the catalysis .
a recent study on the pseudomonas syringae uc and ah also ruled out the possibility that they form a transit complex to facilitate substrate channeling of allophanate during the catalysis [ 32 ] .
klua forms a tight complex .
our study indicates that it catalyzes the urea to ammonium conversion more efficiently , compared with the mixture of isolated kluc and klah .
subsequent analysis indicates that this is due to enhanced ah activity in the klua holo - enzyme , whereas the uc activity may not be affected by the holo - enzyme formation .
the enhancement of the ah activity might be partly contributed by the interactions between the ah and uc domains , which could stabilize the structure of the ah domain .
in addition , the positively charged surface patch on the uc domain near the ah n domain active site ( figure 3c ) might facilitate the recruitment of allophanate , and enhance the ah activity .
this suggests that the single - polypeptide form of ua is a more efficient nano - machine , compared with those composed of separated uc and ah proteins .
the ua gene is most likely the result of a fusion event of the ah and uc genes .
our data indicate that such fusion produces a more efficient ua , therefore might confer a selective advantage in evolution .
gene fusion is among the most commonly utilized means by nature to generate novel genes , and it has been suggested that fusion events do not occur randomly and confer selective advantage [ 33,34 ] .
our study on klua provides an interesting example in this regard .
the ah domain plays a central role in the klua holo - enzyme formation .
it is located at the center of the holo - enzyme and mediates most of the interactions between klua polypeptides .
its activity is enhanced by interactions with other domains in the holo - enzyme , which probably stabilizes its structure and / or facilitates its substrate recruitment .
in many microorganisms , ah ( also called atzf and trzf ) is involved in the cyanuric acid degradation pathway [ 35 - 37 ] , and forms a complex with atzd ( cyanuric acid amidohydrolase ) and atze ( biuret amidohydrolase ) , enzymes upstream in this pathway [ 19 ] .
it would be interesting to see what role it plays in the formation of this complex , and if its activity is enhanced by this complex .

pyrenophora tritici - repentis , the causal agent of tan spot disease of wheat , mediates disease by the production of host - selective toxins ( hst ) .
the known toxins are recognized in an ' inverse ' gene - for - gene manner , where each is perceived by the product of a unique locus in the host and recognition leads to disease susceptibility .
given the importance of hsts in disease development , we would predict that the loss of any of these major pathogenicity factors would result in reduced virulence and disease development .
however , after either deletion of the gene encoding the hst toxa or , reciprocally , heterologous expression of toxa in a race that does not normally produce the toxin followed by inoculation of toxa - sensitive and insensitive wheat cultivars , we demonstrate that toxa symptom development can be epistatic to other hst - induced symptoms .
toxa epistasis on certain toxa - sensitive wheat cultivars leads to genotype - specific increases in total leaf area affected by disease .
these data indicate a complex interplay between host responses to hsts in some genotypes and underscore the challenge of identifying additional hsts whose activity may be masked by other toxins .
also , through mycelial staining , we acquire preliminary evidence that toxa may provide additional benefits to fungal growth in planta in the absence of its cognate recognition partner in the host .

introduction host selective toxins ( hsts ) , a subset of effectors produced by some necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungi , are major pathogenicity factors that mediate the disease tan spot of wheat caused by pyrenophora tritici - repentis ( died. ) drechs .

tan spot has emerged as one of the most important wheat foliar diseases in several major wheat growing areas [ 5,6,7,8 ] .
the increase in disease incidence is thought to be due to the adoption of conservation tillage practices [ 9,10 ] and the acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of a potent hst , ptr toxa ( toxa ) [ 11 ] .
the importance of hsts in pathogenicity in the ptr - wheat pathosystem has been demonstrated by conversion of a nonpathogenic isolate to a pathogenic isolate through heterologous expression of genes that encode hsts [ 1,12 ] .
so far , there are two well - characterized proteinaceous hsts , toxa and toxb ( recently reviewed in : [ 1,3,4 ]) , and one partially - characterized , non - protein hst , toxc [ 13,14 ] .
toxa is a potent necrotizing toxin on toxa - sensitive cultivars [ 15,16,17 ] and isolates that produce toxa typically induce grey to tan necrotic lesions with dark centers that are sometimes associated with a chlorotic halo .
toxb and toxc production induces chlorosis on their respective sensitive hosts , with toxc - induced chlorosis spreading throughout the leaf [ 18 ] .
the presence of other uncharacterized hsts have been implied from inoculations on differentiating host genotypes [ 19,20 ] , genetic screening [ 21 ] , and partial purifications of components from crude culture filtrates [ 17,22 ] .
each of the currently identified races of the pathosystem ( except for the nonpathogenic race 4 ) are defined by the expression of the known hsts ( toxa , b , and c ) either singly or in all possible combinations [ 23 ] .
the ptr - wheat pathosystem has been described as an ' inverse ' gene - for - gene system where each individual toxin is recognized by the product of a single locus in a sensitive host and this recognition results in host susceptibility and disease [ 24,25 ] .
an excellent review on the genetics of tan spot resistance in wheat has recently been published by faris and colleagues [ 26 ] .
three independent loci in wheat have been identified that contribute to the recognition of each known hst , tsn1 for toxa , tsc2 for toxb , and tsc1 for toxc .
sensitivity to hsts is typically dominant , as in the case of toxa and toxb .
the interaction between tsc1 - toxc appears more complex and has been interpreted to range from recessive to dominant .
tsn1 , which thus far is the only locus well described [ 27 ] , encodes a protein similar to resistance ( r ) proteins that recognize ' avirulence ' effectors [ 28 ] .
typical avr - r gene interactions result in a ' resistance response ' that in many cases involves a hypersensitive cell death response ( hr ) [ 29,30 ] .
in these ' classical ' gene - for - gene interactions the hr is associated with disease resistance but in the r gene - like tsn1 - toxa interaction , the massive transcriptional re - programming , induction of defense responses , and cell death lead to disease susceptibility [ 31,32 ] .
in this manuscript , we describe the impact of loss of toxa on virulence of the ptr isolate bfp ( race 1 ) toward both toxa - sensitive and - insensitive host genotypes .
we selected bfp for this study as : 1 ) we have a well - assembled and annotated genome of this isolate [ 33 ] , 2 ) there are additional hsts produced by this isolate , i.e. the chlorosis - inducing toxin , toxc , and unnamed proteinaceous toxins , which have been phenotypically described and partially isolated and characterized , but are currently genotypically uncharacterized [ 13,17 ] , and 3 ) toxa is a major pathogenicity factor in this isolate and lack of toxa production should significantly impact virulence .
we found that expression of toxa could either positively or negatively impact symptom development dependent upon the toxa - sensitive host genotype .
in two toxa - sensitive genotypes , ' tam 105 ' and ' katepwa ' , symptoms induced by expression of toxa by bfp are epistatic to the effects of a spreading chlorosis - and additional necrosis - inducing hst .
we also found that heterologous expression of toxa in d308 , a toxc - producing ( race 3 ) ptr isolate , leads to epistasis of spreading chlorosis on toxa - sensitive genotypes as well as increased mycelial growth in a toxc - sensitive , toxa - insensitive host .
data described in this manuscript support the emerging hypothesis that hsts have an alternative function in the ptr - wheat pathosystem in the absence of their cognate host - recognition partner and , further , provide the first report of necrotrophic effector epistasis .
materials and methods plant material and fungal isolates the wheat cultivars used in this study include the toxa - sensitive cultivars ' tam 105 '[ 17 ] , ' glenlea ' and ' katepwa ' [ 34 ] , the tan spot resistant ( insensitive to all known toxins ) cultivar ' auburn ' [ 17 ] , and the toxc - sensitive cultivar , ' 6b365 ' [ 34 ] .
the p. tritici - repentis isolates used in this study were a race 1 and race 3 isolate , bfp [ 17 ] and d308 [ 35 ] , respectively .
bfp is a subculture derived from pt - 1c ; pt - 1c was obtained from w. bockus ( kansas state university , manhattan , u.s.a. ) and the isolate used for generation of the p. tritici - repentis reference genome [ 33 ] .
d308 was obtained from l. lamari .
toxa gene replacement , heterologous expression and transformation the genome sequence of bfp is available for download at the broad institute website ( http :// www.broadinstitute.org / annotation / genome / pyrenophora _ tritici _ repentis /) .
primers used for this study are presented in s1 table .
genomic sequence data ( supercontig 1.4 - 1447500 - 1450899 ) were used for construct and primer design to clone toxa 5 ' - and 3 ' - flanking regions .
these flanking regions were amplified in a mixture that contained 1.7 ng bfp gdna , 1x gotaq flexi buffer , 2mm mgcl2 , 0.2 mm dntp , 0.25 mm each primer , and 1u taq ( promega , madison , wi ) in a total reaction of 50 mul using the following parameters : 94degreesc 3 min , 29 cycles of 94degreesc 45 s , 58degreesc 30 s , 72degreesc 2 min , and a final extension at 72degreesc for 7 min .
the resulting fragments were cloned into pgem - teasy ( promega ) and identity confirmed by sequencing at the center for genome research & biocomputing , cgrb core facilities , oregon state university .
the 5 ' - flanking region was liberated by restriction digestion with apai and xhoi and subcloned into pct48 [ 12 ] cut with the same restriction enzymes , just upstream of the hygr cassette .
the 3 ' - flanking region was liberated by restriction digestion with smai and noti and cloned into the 5 ' - flanking : : hygr - containing construct cut with the same restriction enzymes just downstream of the hygr cassette to produce the plasmid pcvm167 .
pcvm167 was used as a template for pcr amplification of a single fragment or two fragments ( split marker ) that overlapped in the hph gene .
pcr amplification was performed as above with 1 ng of template dna .
for transformation purposes , pcr products were purified with a qiagen pcr purification kit ( valencia , ca ) .
similar pcr conditions were used for screening for homologous recombination and orientation .
protoplasts were prepared as in [ 12 ] with modifications .
one g of bfp mycelia was digested in a 25 ml flask overnight at 25degreesc , shaking at 60 rpm , in 9 ml osmoticum ( 100mm napo4 , ph 5.8 , 2m mgso4 ) containing 22.5 mg driselase ( interspex ) , 4.5 mg beta - glucuronidase ( 367,500 u / g ) ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) , and 45 mg lysing enzyme ( sigma - aldrich ) that had been filtered through a 45 mum filter .
protoplasts were filtered sequentially through 200 , 100 and 50 um nytex , collected by centrifugation , and resuspended at a concentration of 2 x 107 / ml stc ( 1.2 m sorbitol , 10 mm tris , ph 7.5 , 10 mm cacl2 ) : peg4000 ( 40 % polyethylene glycol ( 4000 ) , 50mm tris. ph 7.5 , 50 mm cacl2 ) : dmso ( 80:20:1 ) .
transformation was performed in 15 ml round - bottom tubes on ice by adding 200 mul of protoplasts , and rolling in 2 mul 50 mm spermidine , either 3.5 mug each split - marker or 5 mug full length pcr fragment , followed by an equal amount of stc .
after a 20 min incubation on ice , 200 mul , 200 mul and 800 mul of peg4000 where rolled into the protoplasts , with a 5 min incubation on ice after each addition .
after addition of 1 ml stc , the protoplasts were split into two 15 ml tubes , mixed gently with 10 ml of 46degreesc regeneration media ( 1.2 m sucrose , 0.1 % yeast extract , 0.1 % casein hydrosylate ( enzymatic ) , 1.5 % agar , ph 5.9 ) , and immediately poured into a petri dish .
solidified plates were incubated at 25degreesc for 2 days and then overlaid with 60 mug / ml hygromycin ( hyg ; research products international corporation , mount prospect , il ) in 1 % water agar .
five days post overlay , colonies were transferred to v8 - pda ( 15 % v8 juice , 10g potato dextrose agar , 3g caco3 , 10g bacto agar , in 1 liter ) amended with hyg at 150 mug / ml. preliminary screening for gene replacement was performed with the primers for chitin synthase and toxa as described in [ 21 ] .
transformants screened for the absence of toxa included all generated from the linear minimal element ( lme ) , six from the large linear fragment , and five from the split marker .
copy number was determined by qpcr of hyg with chitin synthase a ( csa , ptrg _ 02340 ) as the internal single copy gene standard .
primers were designed in primer3 ( http :// frodo.wi.mit.edu / primer3 /) and the primer sequences tested for possible secondary structure formation in beacondesigner ( premier biosoft ) .
the possibility of amplicon secondary structure was tested with idt scitools mfold .
primer efficiencies were 96 and 100 % for csa and hyg , respectively .
the 1 - 5 - 1 transformant was used to generate a standard curve of cq vs. input concentration for each amplicon .
quantitative pcr was performed with 10 ng of input gdna and iq sybrgreen supermix ( bio - rad , hercules , ca ) in the cfx96 realtime detection system .
data were analyzed with the cfx manager 2.1 software package .
d308 protoplasts were produced with two times the amount of enzymes used for bfp and with 5 h incubation .
protoplasts were transformed as above with pcr fragments generated with t3 and t7 primers from the plasmids pct48 and pct53 [ 12 ] as described above .
isolate growth comparison and plant inoculation for isolate growth comparisons , similar - sized plugs (# 2 cork borer ) from bfp , d308 , and their transformants were grown on v8 - pda for 6 days in the dark at 25degreesc .
plates were scanned on an epson expression 1600 scanner ( epson , long beach , ca ) at 600 dpi .
for colony size comparison , colony size was estimated by multiplication of the largest and smallest diameter of the colony and mean and standard error calculated for 8 replicates .
for inoculations , plugs of isolates were grown for 5 and 7 days for bfp and d308 ( and their transformants ) , respectively .
mycelia were flooded with water (~ 8 ml ) , matted with a bent glass rod , incubated 24 h in constant light at 25degreesc , transferred to 16degreesc , and incubated for 24 h in constant dark .
conidia were harvested by flooding the plate with sterile e - pure water + 0.01 % tween - 20 , allowed to settle at 4degreesc , the volume reduced to ~ 5 ml , and the concentration of conidia estimated by counting in a hemocytomer ( neubauer ) .
two week - old plants were inoculated with 3 x 103 conidia / ml tween water .
because of the different growth rates for bfp and d308 , leaves from plants inoculated with bfp and d308 ( and their transformants ) were harvested and scanned for documentation at 5 and 6 days , respectively .
inoculations were performed at least three times .
dna and protein isolation , protein gel electrophoresis and western blotting for genomic dna isolation , 50 ml of difco potato dextrose broth ( becton , dickinson , and co. , sparks , md ) was inoculated with 5 plugs of fungal mycelia , the culture grown for 3 days at room temperature with gentle shaking (~ 80 rpm ) , tissue harvested on miracloth , the mycelia lyophilized , and dna prepared with a fastdna spin kit ( mp biomedicals , santa ana , ca ) following manufacturer 's recommendations .
crude culture filtrates ( ccf ) containing secreted proteins were produced by inoculating 50 ml of modified fries media ( 15g sucrose , 5g nh4 tartrate , 1g nh4no3 , 1g kh2po4 , mgso4 . 7 h2o , 0.1g nacl , 0.1g cacl2 . 2h2o , 1g yeast extract in 1 liter ) with 5 plugs and incubating in the growth chamber for 10 - 12 days .
ccf was harvested through 4 layers of cheesecloth and stored at - 20degreesc in aliquots .
protein precipitation was performed as described in [ 12 ] .
proteins were separated on a 12 % sds - polyacrylamide gel using the buffer system described in [ 36 ] .
silver staining of gels was performed with the pierce silver stain kit ( thermo scientific , waltham , ma ) and western blotting was performed as described in [ 37 ] .
quantification of diseased leaf tissue leaves were scanned on an epson expression 1600 scanner at 600 dpi .
images were opened in adobe photoshop ( adobe , san jose , ca ) and an entire leaf was selected with the magic wand tool with tolerance set to 100 and anti - alias selected .
the total number of pixels in the leaf tissue was recorded .
for determining the amount of green and chlorotic tissue , the ink dropper tool was used to select either green or chorotic regions of a leaf and the color range tool was used to create a filter that represented the range of colors in each tissue type .
for each leaf analyzed , the color range tool was opened , the appropriate color range file loaded , and the number of pixels containing that color range was recorded .
the percent of each tissue type was calculated as ( number of colored pixels / number of total pixels ) x 100 .
the percent of necrotic tissue was calculated by subtracting the amount of percent of green and chorotic tissue from 100 % .
in planta mycelial staining leaf staining was based on the technique described in [ 38 ] with some modifications .
briefly , 1 ml 1m koh / 0.05 % silwet l - 77 ( lehle seeds , round rock , tx ) was added to a 1 cm leaf section , tubes placed in an autoclave , the cycle started until pressure ( 15 psi ) and temperature ( 121degreesc ) was reached , and then immediately slow exhausted .
the koh was removed to new tubes for chlorophyll quantity estimation ( see below ) and leaf slices washed gently with 50 mm tris ph 7.5 and equilibrated for 20 min in 10 ml 50 mm tris ph 7.5 .
buffer was removed and leaves stained overnight at room temperature in the dark with 250 mul 20 mug / ml wheat germ agglutinin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( wga - fitc ; sigma - aldrich ) .
after staining , a single leaf section was gently rinsed and floated into a glass petri dish that contained 50 mm tris , ph 7.5 .
the leaf section , which is very fragile at this stage , was transferred to a slide and drops of buffer added until the leaf uncurled , and then a coverslip was lightly pressed on top of the section to remove excess liquid .
leaves were imaged on a leica mzfliii ( bartles and stout , inc. , issaqua , wa ) fitted with a gfp filter ( excitation 470 / 40nm ; barrier 525 / 50nm ) .
six fluorescent and brightfield images were captured with a coolsnap - pro camera ( media cybernetics , rockville , md ) fitted to the stereoscope and imagepro plus software ( media cybernetics ) and images overlaid to create a montage that approximates the entire leaf section .
leaves were also visualized at high magnification both on the fluorescent stereoscope and on a compound fluorescent microscope to ensure the low magnification images accurately reflected all of the mycelia present .
at least three leaf sections from each isolate / cultivar combination where examined .
for chlorophyll estimation , the od654 of the koh solution that was removed from the leaf slices was measured with a beckman du640 spectrophotometer and total chlorophyll was estimated with the formula : mug / ml total chlorophyll = 25.7 x ( absorbance at 654 nm ) .
a minimum of three sections per isolate / cultivar combination were examined .
results toxa gene replacement in a p. tritici - repentis race 1 isolate the loss of a major pathogenicity factor should result in an isolate with diminished virulence .
to test this in ptr , we targeted the gene encoding the highly - active necrosis - inducing hst , toxa , for replacement .
we utilized the race 1 ( toxa - and toxc - expressing ) ptr isolate bfp , for which we have a reference genome , and tested several approaches for gene replacement by homologous recombination of a hygromycin resistance cassette ( hygr ) into the toxa - coding region .
the three approaches used included bfp protoplast transformation of : 1 ) a linear minimal element ( lme ) [ 39 ] that contained a 677 bp fragment of toxa fused to hygr , 2 ) a large linear fragment containing 5 ' and 3 ' flanking regions of toxa surrounding hygr , and 3 ) two fragments of the large linear fragment described above but overlapping by 176 bp in the hph gene , commonly referred to as the split - marker approach [ 40 ] .
after transformation , hyg - resistant transformants were selected on hyg - containing media .
we obtained 26 hygr colonies with the lme in a single transformation , and 23 large linear and 25 split - marker hygr colonies total in two transformations of each .
preliminary screening for the absence of toxa revealed that lme transformation had the lowest homologous recombination efficiency at 4 % , whereas the large linear and split - marker approaches were much more efficient at 40 and 60 % , respectively .
for the experiments described in this work , we utilized colonies generated by either the large linear or split - marker approach .
to prepare the large linear and split - marker fragments , ~ 1 kb of 5 ' - and 3 ' - flanking regions of toxa were first pcr amplified from bfp genomic dna ( gdna ) with primers 5'flank - f1 / r1 and 3'flank - f1 / r1 and cloned into a plasmid upstream and downstream of a hygr cassette ( fig 1a ) .
the large linear fragment was amplified from the template with plasmid - specific primers t3 / t7 and the split - marker fragments were amplified with tako - split f1 / r1 & f2 / r2 .
after transformation , selection on hyg - containing media , and confirmation of the absence of toxa , transformants were tested for whether the gene replacement construct was properly inserted into the toxa - containing genomic region ( fig 1b ) .
genomic dna of bfp and transformants was amplified with primers just outside of the putative homologous recombination region ( ta - replacement - f1 / r1 ) and separated by gel electrophoresis ( fig 1b , left panel ) .
if the fragments had undergone homologous recombination , the pcr amplification product should be 150 bp larger than the product from untransformed bfp .
all transformants tested had the larger band .
to insure proper orientation , gdna was amplified with primers that anneal to hph ( tako - split - f2 ) and the 3 ' flanking region ( ta - replacement - r1 ) , which should generate a ~ 2 - kb band only in the transformants ( fig 1b , right panel ) .
all of the transformants had the proper sized product and as expected , no product was amplified from untransformed bfp .
to confirm a single insertion , we used quantitative pcr and calculated the ratio of the concentration of hph and the single copy gene chitin synthase a ( csa ) , which should be approximately 1 if there is a single insertion ( fig 1c ) .
this process estimated zero copies of hph in untransformed bfp , two copies in 1 - 1 - 1 , and a single copy in the other three transformants , 1 - 5 - 1 , 1 - 5 - 11 , and 1 - 5 - 13 .
the two copies estimated for 1 - 1 - 1 is consistent with the increased quantity of the pcr amplification product seen when testing for gene replacement ( fig 1b , left panel ) .
we chose the toxa gene replacement isolates 1 - 5 - 1 and 1 - 5 - 11 for further characterization .
in the remainder of the text , we refer to these transgenic isolates as toxa knockouts , bfpdeltatoxa , or by their individual isolate name .

black arrowheads indicate the position of pcr primers used for cloning and positional screening and the numbers above the top schematic indicate primer sequence position on supercontig 1.4 .
genomic dna from bfp and transformants was ( b ) pcr amplified to test for toxa replacement ( left ) and proper orientation of the trpc : : hph replacement construct ( right ) and ( c ) , subjected to qpcr to predict the copy number of the trpc : : hph fragment by calculating the ratio of the concentration of hph to the concentration of the single copy gene chitin synthase a ( csa ) .
the molecular mass of standards in the molecular mass ladder ( m ) is indicated on the left of panel b. to determine if the loss of toxa or the acquisition of hygr altered the growth of isolates , we plated equal sized plugs of bfp , 1 - 5 - 1 , and 1 - 5 - 11 on v8 - pda and documented growth 6 days after plating ( fig 2a ) .
the two toxa knockouts grew at the same rate with the same symmetric radial growth pattern as the wild type isolate , bfp .
to confirm that replacement of toxa with hygr resulted in the lack of toxa production , we prepared crude culture filtrate ( ccf ) from each isolate , separated equal amounts of filtrate by sds - page , and detected proteins via silver stain ( fig 2b ) and toxa specifically by western blotting with anti - toxa antisera ( fig 2c ) .
the silver - stained gel showed a similar banding pattern for bfp and the toxa knockouts with the exception of a band in bfp ccf at ~ 13 kda ( fig 2b , arrowhead ) consistent with the known banding pattern of toxa [ 17 ] .
also , western blotting detected a ~ 13 - kda band only in ccf from bfp .
taken together , the sds - page results indicate that gene replacement of toxa in the knockout isolates resulted in the lack of toxa production .
to determine if the lack of toxa production impacts the production of the other known hst produced by bfp , toxc , we inoculated the toxa - insensitive , toxc - sensitive cultivar ' 6b365 ' and recorded symptom development 5 days post inoculation ( dpi ) .
all isolates conidiated similarly and induced dark brown lesions of varying sizes ( fig 2d ) .
additionally , all isolates induced similar levels of spreading chlorosis typical of toxc - induced symptoms .
this shows that the expression of toxa , or lack thereof , does not impact the expression of toxc , at least in this toxc - sensitive wheat cultivar .
collectively , these data indicate that except for the production of toxa , bfp and bfpdeltatoxa isolates behave similarly .

leaves were harvested 5 days post inoculation .
disease reaction and in planta mycelial growth of bfpdeltatoxa isolates we next tested whether disease development on toxa - sensitive and a resistant cultivar ( toxa - insensitive ) was impacted by toxa replacement ( fig 3 ) .
inoculation of the tan spot resistant cultivar , ' auburn ' , by bfp , 1 - 5 - 1 , and 1 - 5 - 11 resulted in a typical resistance reaction of a few small dark brown lesions with most of the leaf tissue remaining green ( fig 3a , left panel ) .
this is in contrast to the reaction of the toxa - sensitive cultivar ' tam 105 ' with bfp , which showed symptom development that included the typical toxa - induced tan - necrotic lesion with a dark center and green leaf tissue where the lesions did not coalesce ( fig 3a , right panel , top leaves ) .
inoculation of toxa - knockout isolates , 1 - 5 - 1 and 1 - 5 - 11 , on ' tam 105 ' induced similar - sized tan - necrotic lesions with darkened centers , but also resulted in a spreading chlorosis symptom not seen in inoculations of the toxa - expressing parent isolate , bfp ( fig 3a , right panel , middle and bottom leaves ). by quantifying the percentage of green , chlorotic , and necrotic tissue , we found that the amounts were similar in all of the ' auburn ' inoculations ; however , inoculation of toxa - knockout isolates on ' tam 105 ' resulted in less green tissue , more chlorotic tissue , and the same amount of necrotic tissue as bfp ( fig 3b ) .
therefore , inoculation of the toxa - knockout isolates on ' tam 105 ' actually resulted in greater leaf area affected by disease than inoculation of the toxa - expressing parent isolate bfp .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0123548.g003 fig 3 symptom development induced by bfp and bfpdeltatoxa isolates on toxa - sensitive and - insensitive cultivars .
the toxa - insensitive and - sensitive cultivars , ' auburn ' and ' tam 105 ' , respectively , were inoculated and the symptoms ( a ) monitored and ( b ) quantified ( chlorosis and necrosis ) .
bars represent means of values from three leaves per experiment from three independent experiments ( nine total ) , error bars represent standard error , and * indicates a statistical difference from bfp as measured by a student 's t - test ( p < 0.05 ) .
( c ) symptom development on two additional toxa - sensitive cultivars , ' katepwa ' and ' glenlea ' .
leaves were harvested 5 days post inoculation .
inoculation of bfp on the toxa - sensitive cultivar ' katepwa ' also resulted in the typical toxa - induced tan spot lesion ( fig 3c , left panel , top leaves ) ; however , inoculation of the toxa - knockout isolates produced lesions that contained small tan - necrotic centers surrounded by chlorosis , and spreading chlorosis throughout the leaf ( fig 3c , left panel , middle and bottom leaves ) , with the result of greater leaf area affected in toxa - knockout inoculations than in bfp inoculations .
in inoculations of a third toxa - sensitive cultivar , ' glenlea ' , again bfp induced typical tan - necrotic lesions , but the toxa - knockout isolates appear to be reduced in the amount of disease produced , with small dark brown necrotic lesions being the major symptom .
these data show that toxa symptom development may be epistatic to other symptoms in some cultivars .
on the toxa - sensitive cultivar ' tam 105 ' , toxa symptom expression was epistatic to the expression of symptoms induced by a toxin with similar necrosis - inducing activity as toxa and a spreading chlorosis toxin .
on ' katepwa ' , toxa - induced symptoms were epistatic to symptom expression caused by a toxin ( s ) that induces small necrotic lesions with associated chlorosis and spreading chlorosis .
' glenlea ' was the only toxa - sensitive cultivar in which toxa - induced epistasis was not apparent .
it is possible that the increase in chlorosis with toxa - knockout inoculations on ' tam 105 ' was due to either a diffusible factor or proliferation of mycelia .
to test this , we adapted the procedure of ayliffe and colleagues [ 38 ] to stain 1 cm leaf sections with fitc - labeled wheat germ agglutinin ( wga - fitc ) , which binds to chitin , and visualized the stained leaf sections with fluorescent microscopy ( fig 4 ) .
each stained section contained at least a single lesion ( fig 4 , leaf section ) .
estimation of total chlorophyll showed less chlorophyll in sections taken from leaves inoculated with toxa knockouts compared to the toxa - expressing parent isolate bfp ( fig 4 , chl. ) , consistent with the increase in spreading chlorosis in toxa knockout - inoculated leaves ( fig 3 ) .
mycelial staining was easily visualized in necrotic lesions only ( fig 4 , wga - fitc ) , and examination at higher magnifications confirmed that very little mycelial growth occurred outside of the large necrotic lesions ( fig 4 , wga - fitc , bottom row ) .
horizontal lines of fluorescence were associated with vascular tissue and a background haze of fluorescence was often associated with a lesion , but we considered this as non - wga - fitc - associated fluorescence .
these data suggest that the spreading chlorosis was not due to proliferation of mycelia but rather to a diffusible factor , possibly toxc .

heterologous expression of toxa in a p. tritici - repentis race 3 isolate as shown ( fig 2d ) , toxc induces spreading chlorosis on the toxc - sensitive cultivar ' 6b365 ' that is similar to the spreading chlorosis produced on ' tam 105 ' by bfpdeltatoxa isolates ( fig 3a ) .
however , to our knowledge it has not been shown that ' tam 105 ' is toxc - sensitive .
to test this , we inoculated ' tam 105 ' with the race 3 toxc - producing isolate , d308 .
d308 is a slower - growing isolate than bfp that sometimes grows abnormally without radial symmetry on v8 - pda plates ( 0 - 1 abnormal colonies / 5 total plates ) .
additionally , those colonies that grow abnormally do not conidiate as well as those with symmetric radial growth .
because of the reduced growth rate , we assessed symptom development at 6 dpi rather than 5 dpi as with bfp and its derived isolates .
d308 - induced symptoms on ' tam 105 ' included small light brown to tan necrotic lesions , some with chlorotic haloes , and spreading chlorosis ( fig 5a ) , consistent with ' tam 105 ' sensitivity to toxc .

we next sought to determine if toxa expression by d308 would inhibit the spreading chlorosis symptom on ' tam 105 ' as was observed for the toxa - and toxc - producing race 1 bfp isolate .
therefore , we transformed d308 protoplasts with a toxa - expression construct that includes hygr ( hygr : : toxa ) and a construct containing hygr alone as a control ( fig 5b ) and generated two control ( 48 - 1 and 2 ) and two toxa - transformed ( 53 - 1 and 2 ) hygr colonies in a single transformation .
all transformants grew similarly to d308 on v8 - pda with the exception of 53 - 1 , which grew more slowly and individual colonies more often had abnormal radial growth than the parent isolate ( 0 - 3 abnormal colonies / 5 total v8 - pda plates ; examples of colonial morphology presented in fig 5c ) .
to quantify differences in radial growth between d308 and 53 - 1 we compared colony size after 6 days of growth on v8 - pda ( d308 : 30.6 +/ - 0.3 and 32.6 +/ - 0.4 cm2 vs 53 - 1 : 26.9 +/ - 1.6 and 21.6 +/ - 1.8 cm2 ) and found that growth of 53 - 1 was always slower and more variable than d308 ( 88 and 66 % of d308 ). whether the more irregular growth pattern of 53 - 1 was due to the insertion position of the transforming construct or over - expression of hygr : : toxa was not determined .
to confirm expression of toxa by the hygr : : toxa transformed isolates , we prepared ccf from d308 , the control ( 48 - 1 and 2 ) and toxa - transformed ( 53 - 1 and 2 ) isolates , and bfp as a toxa - producing control , separated equal amounts of precipitated protein by sds - page , and detected proteins via silver stain and toxa specifically by western blotting with anti - toxa antisera .
the silver - stained gel showed only bfp and the toxa - transformed isolates , 53 - 1 and 53 - 2 , with a band at ~ 13 kda , consistent with toxa production ( fig 5d ) .
the amount of toxa produced in ccf by bfp and 53 - 2 was comparable , whereas more was produced by 53 - 1 .
these observations were confirmed by western blotting ( fig 5e ) .
we used d308 , the control transformant 48 - 1 , and the toxa transformant 53 - 2 for further testing , as 53 - 2 produced similar levels of toxa as the reference isolate bfp .
all isolates induce small dark brown lesions and similar levels of chlorosis on the toxc - sensitive cultivar ' 6b365 ' ( fig 5f ) .
disease reaction and in planta mycelial growth of toxa - transformed race 3 isolates inoculation of ' auburn ' with d308 and the d308 transformants 48 - 1 and 53 - 2 produced a typical resistance reaction ( fig 6a , left panel ) .
on ' tam 105 ' , spreading chlorosis was seen in inoculations of d308 and the hygr control , 48 - 1 , but not in inoculations of the toxa - expressing transformant , 53 - 2 , where the symptom was primarily necrotic lesions ( fig 6a , right panel ) .
inoculations of 53 - 1 on ' auburn ' and ' tam105 ' gave a similar phenotype to those of 53 - 2 on the same cultivars , but the necrotic lesions on ' tam105 ' were larger , perhaps due to increased toxa expression ( s1 fig ) .
quantification of the percent of green , chlorotic , and necrotic tissue shows that the toxa - expressing transformant , 53 - 2 , had more green and necrotic tissue , and less chlorotic tissue than d308 ( fig 6b ) , consistent with the toxa epistasis of toxc symptom development .
inoculation with d308 and 48 - 1 of the toxa - sensitive cultivar ' katepwa ' showed very little disease development , but with 53 - 2 showed typical tan necrosis lesions induced by toxa ( fig 6c ) .

( c ) symptom development on the toxa - sensitive cultivar , ' katepwa ' .
leaves were harvested 6 days post inoculation .
to determine if the spreading chlorosis seen in d308 and 48 - 1 inoculated ' tam 105 ' was due to a diffusible factor or mycelial growth as investigated in inoculations of the bfpdeltatoxa isolates , we stained leaf sections of inoculated ' tam 105 ' with wga - fitc ( fig 7a ) .
estimation of total chlorophyll present in each leaf section of ' tam 105 ' analyzed showed lower chlorophyll content in the d308 - and 48 - 1 - inoculated leaf sections compared with those of the toxa - transformed isolate , 53 - 2 ( fig 7a , chl. ) , consistent with the chlorotic symptoms induced by the non - toxa expressing isolates .
significant mycelial staining was visualized only in lesions ( fig 7 , wga - fitc ) , and examination at higher magnifications confirmed that very little mycelial growth occurred outside of the lesions ( fig 7a , wga - fitc , bottom row ) .
mycelial growth was much less in the d308 - and 48 - 1 - induced lesions when compared to the 53 - 2 - induced lesions .
in fact , some d308 and 48 - 1 lesions showed very little mycelial growth ( fig 7a , e.g. lesion 2 ) and an apparent lack of penetration ( fig 7a , e.g. lesion 4 ) .
as expected , expression of toxa by the toxa transformant , 53 - 2 , provided a benefit for mycelial growth in the toxa - sensitive ' tam 105 ' cultivar ( fig 7a , compare lesions 5 and 6 with 1 through 4 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0123548.g007 fig 7 mycelial growth in planta of d308 and d308 transformants .
isolates were inoculated on the toxa - and toxc - sensitive cultivars ( a ) ' tam 105 ' and ( b ) ' 6b365 ' , respectively .
one centimeter leaf sections harvested from inoculated leaves 6 days post inoculation were scanned ( leaf section ) , chlorophyll concentration estimated ( chl. ) , and mycelia stained with wga - fitc .
stained leaves were imaged with a fluorescent microscope and the whole leaf image is a montage of 6 separate panels that cover the entire 1 cm leaf section .
the bottom row represents increased magnification of the same size of select ( numbered ) lesions .
arrows point to multiple conidia .
given the above data , it seems likely that the spreading chlorosis in ' tam 105 ' inoculations with toxc - expressing isolates that lack toxa is due to toxc , and furthermore , that the chlorosis is due to toxc diffusion and not mycelial growth throughout the tissue .
to further evaluate this , we assessed mycelial growth in the toxc - sensitive cultivar ' 6b365 ' inoculated with d308 , the control transformant 48 - 1 , and the toxa - expressing transformant , 53 - 2 ( fig 7b ) , all of which induce similar levels of spreading chlorosis in ' 6b365 ' ( figs 5f and 7b ) .
all leaf sections examined had small to medium - sized dark brown lesions and significant spreading chlorosis ( fig 7b , leaf section ) as confirmed by the low chlorophyll content ( fig 7b , chl. ) .
mycelial growth was confined to lesions ( fig 7b , wga - fitc ) .
in some lesions , particularly in leaves inoculated with d308 and 48 - 1 , there was very little growth ( fig 7b , e.g. lesions 8 and 10 ) and the larger lesions that contained greater amounts of mycelia were often associated with multiple conidia ( fig 7b , arrows ) .
in contrast , greater mycelial growth was typically evident in 53 - 2 lesions , and these were not necessarily associated with multiple conidia ( fig 7b , e.g. lesion 11 ) .
thus , visual inspection of mycelial growth suggested that in ' 6b365 ' , 53 - 2 grows better than d308 and 48 - 1 .
discussion in this study , we utilize multiple methods for gene replacement in the genome of the tan spot pathogen , p. tritici - repentis ( fig 1 ) .
lme - mediated transformation produced many transformants , but only a small percentage of these were homologous integrants ; therefore , although this method is very efficient in the closely - related species alternaria brassicicola [ 39 ] , it does not appear to be optimal for ptr .
transformation with either large - linear or split - marker fragments produced a high percentage of gene - replacing recombinants .
in this study , the large - linear fragment approach appears to have resulted in at least one recombinant with multiple fragments inserted , which suggests that the split - marker approach may be best for this organism / genome .
a fusion pcr approach was also successfully used to generate a toxa replacement construct for transformation of an australian ptr field isolate , although a different antibiotic was used for selection [ 41 ] .
the ability to ' knockout ' single and ' silence ' multicopy genes [ 42,43 ] are important tools for studying tan spot as both single and multi - copy genes are known to impact virulence [ 44,45 ] and others are predicted to play a major role in disease establishment [ 33 ] .
gene replacement of toxa in the race 1 ptr isolate bfp resulted in no toxa production and did not affect isolate growth or toxc - induced spreading chlorosis in the toxc - sensitive cultivar ' 6b365 ' ( fig 2 ) .
current ( fig 3 ) and previous work [ 12 ] from our group has shown that inoculations of bfp on ' tam 105 ' produced only necrotic lesions , consistent with sensitivity to a necrosis - inducing toxin ([ 17 ] and ( fig 3 )) .
contrary to our expectations , in the absence of toxa expression by bfp , the amount of necrosis produced in inoculations of ' tam 105 ' was unchanged and the amount of total symptom development increased , with the appearance of spreading chlorosis ( fig 3 ) .
this indicates that expression / perception of the potent necrotizing toxin , toxa , prevents visualization of symptoms induced by a chlorosis - and additional necrosis - inducing toxin ( s ) .
in other words , toxa symptom development is epistatic in ' tam 105 ' .
the appearance of additional symptoms is likely due to the recognition of additional toxins produced by this isolate , which may include ( but may not be limited to ) two putative , uncharacterized necrosis - inducing toxins and toxc [ 17,33 ] .
although we cannot be certain that the spreading chlorosis observed in ' tam 105 ' is due to toxc , inoculation of ' tam 105 ' with another known toxc - producing isolate , d308 , also induced spreading chlorosis , which was repressed in toxa - expressing d308 transformants ( fig 5 ) .
taken together , these data suggest that expression of toxa can obscure the expression of symptoms induced by other toxins , at least in certain wheat genotypes .
epistasis by toxa appears to be cultivar dependent .
inoculations of bfp - toxa knockouts on the toxa - sensitive cultivar ' katepwa ' resulted in a previously undetectable spreading chlorosis and a reduced necrosis phenotype with extended chlorotic haloes ( fig 3 ) , showing epistasis of toxa to other toxins .
however , toxa epistasis is not apparent in inoculations of the cultivar ' glenlea ' , where in the absence of toxa , bfp induces only small necrotic lesions and disease severity is limited ( fig 3 ) .
moffat and colleagues [ 41 ] also inoculated race1deltatoxa isolates on ' katepwa ' and ' glenlea ' , with similar results , although the spreading chlorosis that we visualize in ' katewpa ' is not as evident and the extent of disease is reduced in their inoculations .
the difference in the appearance of the spreading chlorosis could be because the isolates used in the two studies differ , and therefore are likely to have different suites of hsts .
it is also possible that inoculation conditions and / or the way plants were incubated post inoculation may have contributed to this difference , as it is known that toxc - symptom development can be impacted by environmental conditions [ 26 ] and we have seen that it is highly dependent on the amount of light leaves are exposed to post - inoculation .
the detection of additional symptoms in the absence of toxa is consistent with evidence supporting the presence of additional toxins in race 1 isolates and their corresponding sensitivity loci in the host .
in support of this , ems - derived mutants of the toxa - sensitive wheat cultivar ' kulm ' that are no longer toxa - sensitive still develop necrotic lesions in response to a race 1 isolate , but in some inoculations these lesions are less delimited and more chlorotic [ 46 ] , similar to the necrotic / chlorotic lesions in inoculations with bfpdeltatoxa on ' katepwa ' .
what is very interesting in the light of findings reported here is that ' tam 105 ' as well as other wheat cultivars have been shown to exhibit both necrosis and spreading chlorosis symptoms in response to various ptr race 1 isolates [ 47,48 ] .
cultivar - dependent epistasis of toxa , and possibly other toxins , reveals an additional challenge in the identification of new hsts in the ptr - wheat pathosystem .
these challenges can be overcome with a greater understanding of the complement of hsts present in a global population , the ability to heterologously express toxins in tox - isolates , and screening of diverse host germplasm .
we propose several mechanisms that could explain toxa epistasis .
toxa expression could cause a reduction in the expression of genes responsible for toxc production .
while not testable until more is known about the genes required for toxc production , this is unlikely as toxc - associated symptom development occurs in the toxc sensitive cultivar ' 6b365 ' inoculated with isolates and transformants that make toxc regardless of whether or not they produce toxa ( figs 2 and 5 ) .
also , wheat cultivars exist that exhibit both toxc and toxa symptoms simultaneously [ 47 ] .
it is more likely that genotype - specific plant responses to toxa and possibly other , previously undetected toxins are responsible for this epistasis .
in sensitive leaves , toxa induces rapid transcriptional [ 31 ] , proteomic [ 49 ] , and metabolic changes [ 49,50 ] and leaf collapse and the onset of cell death occur within 14 h of treatment [ 32 ] .
this is more rapid than the appearance of toxc symptoms , which typically are not visible until 3 - 4 dpi ( data not shown ) .
rapid plant cell death could prevent diffusion of toxc or other , previously undetected toxic activities , for example by causing tissue desiccation or conversely , by signaling the fungus to stop production .
why this does not occur in the host genotypes that develop both necrosis and chlorosis in response to toxa - and toxc - expressing race 1 isolates is unclear , but suggests the possibility that the spreading chlorosis on these host is due to sensitivity to an as yet undescribed toxin .
another intriguing possibility is that triggering the r gene - like toxa - sensitivity gene tsn1 in some genotypes leads to suppression of other resistance - like gene responses that may be necessary for the expression of additional hst - induced symptoms .
this is not without precedence as it has been shown that interaction between the r gene i in solanum [ lycopersicon ] pimpinellifolium and avr1 in fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici suppresses disease resistance mediated by i - 2 and i - 3 [ 51 ] .
the ' suppression ' signal would have to be diffusible and / or systemic , as the development of spreading chlorosis occurs in areas where there is no mycelial growth ( figs 4 and 7 ) .
the presence of a systemic signal is consistent with the induction of diffusible metabolites by toxa in toxa - sensitive hosts [ 50 ] .
this current study also examines the association of symptom development and mycelial growth of ptr throughout whole leaf sections , unlike the many elegant studies that have examined at higher magnification the germination , penetration , and in planta colonization of ptr on both susceptible and resistant cultivars [ 35,52,53,54 ] .
in this current work we confirm that mycelial growth within the plant leaf is typically restricted to lesions during early stages of disease , even when spreading chlorosis has affected almost the entire leaf section ( figs 4 and 7 ) .
in inoculations of d308 and its transformants some conidia germinate , do not penetrate , yet still develop small brown lesions ( fig 7 ). whether non - penetrating mycelia or only those that have penetrated the leaf contribute to spreading chlorosis is not known .
as expected , toxa expression by d308 - toxa + results in an obvious increase in mycelial growth in the lesions produced on the toxa - sensitive cultivar ' tam 105 ' .
what was unexpected was that toxa expression by d308 appears to contribute to a slight increase in mycelial growth in the toxa - insensitive cultivar ' 6b365 ' ( fig 7 ) .
if so , this would indicate that toxa can act in a tsn1 - independent manner to provide an advantage to the fungus that allows for greater accumulation of mycelia .
additional studies as to whether such beneficial effects of toxa expression in toxa - insensitive hosts are a general phenomenon , or isolate dependent , wheat genotype dependent , or both are required to confirm these preliminary observations .
interestingly , though toxc causes extensive leaf damage , ptr isolates that express toxc alone are not commonly found in infected wheat fields ; rather , race 1 isolates that express both toxa and toxc are most commonly isolated [ 55,56,57,58,59 ] .
additional functions for hsts in the absence of a sensitivity locus in the plant seem likely .
for instance , our laboratory and others have shown that internal expression of toxa in monocot and dicot hosts can lead to cell death in the absence of tsn1 [ 60,61 ] .
additionally , it has been shown that transcript abundance of the hst toxb is positively correlated with the number and rate of production of appressoria on both sensitive and insensitive hosts [ 42,62 ] , suggesting a role for toxb in basic pathogen fitness .
also , recent work has indicated that necrotrophic pathogens must overcome plant defenses in order to establish infection [ 50 ] .
for example , the hst victorin can enhance virulence of a biotroph in the absence of recognition by its cognate r gene [ 63 ] .
the role of hsts in virulence in the absence of their cognate plant recognition partners , perhaps during an abbreviated biotrophic phase , has thus far been underexplored , and the ptr - wheat pathosystem provides a compelling model for this line of inquiry .

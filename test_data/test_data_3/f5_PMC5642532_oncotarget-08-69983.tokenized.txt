long intergenic non - protein coding rna , regulator of reprogramming ( linc - ror ) is an intergenic long non - coding rna ( lncrna ) previously shown to contribute to tumorigenesis in several malignancies .
however , little is known about whether linc - ror has a role in ovarian cancer progression .
in this study , we found that linc - ror expression was increased in high - grade ovarian serous cancer tissues compared with normal ovarian tissues or normal fallopian tube tissues .
furthermore , the level of linc - ror expression was associated with ovarian cancer international federation of gynecology and obstetrics stage and lymph node metastasis .
linc - ror promoted ovarian cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo , and contributed to cell migration and invasion .
linc - ror knockdown in ovarian cancer cell lines inhibited the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) program , which led to ovarian cancer cell metastasis through the repression of canonical wnt / beta - catenin signaling .
together , our results indicated that linc - ror induces emt in ovarian cancer cells and may be an important molecule in the invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer .
ovarian cancer long non - coding rna epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition invasion metastasis introduction ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among all gynecological malignancies .
compared with early ovarian cancer , patients who are diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer are more likely to have invasion and peritoneal metastasis to adjacent organs [ 1 , 2 ] .
high - grade ovarian serous cancer is a common type of ovarian cancer that is highly malignant and has an aggressive capacity ; most affected patients die from their metastases [ 3 ] .
therefore , the genes associated with invasion and metastasis in ovarian cancer , especially in high - grade ovarian serous cancer , and their modulatory mechanisms have become attractive topics in recent years .
previous studies have indicated that the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) is closely related to the invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer [ 4 ] .
the emt program provides the molecular basis for the invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumor cells , and is a critical event in the early stages of invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors [ 5 ] .
long non - coding rnas ( lncrnas ) are a new group of rnas that were recently discovered by the rapid development of sequencing techniques [ 6 ] .
lncrnas are over 200 nt in length , with no protein coding function , and are involved in transcriptional , post - transcriptional , and epigenetic gene regulation [ 7 - 9 ] .
recent studies revealed that lncrnas regulate diverse cellular processes including stem cell pluripotency , differentiation , tumorigenesis , apoptosis , and metastasis [ 10 - 14 ] .
many lncrnas , such as hotair , h19 , meg3 , and uca1 , have been recognized as key regulators of the occurrence and development of ovarian cancer [ 15 - 18 ] .
long intergenic non - protein coding rna , regulator of reprogramming ( linc - ror ) was first identified as a highly expressed transcript in induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells that is regulated by the key pluripotency factors oct4 , sox2 , and nanog [ 19 , 20 ] .
linc - ror has also been associated with tumorigenesis and emt in many malignancies including breast , liver , pancreatic , and colon cancers [ 21 - 24 ] .
however , the relationship between linc - ror and emt in ovarian cancer progression and metastasis remains unknown .
in this study , we assessed linc - ror expression in high - grade ovarian serous cancer tissues , normal ovarian tissues , and normal fallopian tube tissues , and further analyzed the relationship between the level of linc - ror expression and ovarian cancer international federation of gynecology and obstetrics ( figo ) stage and lymph node metastasis .
we then investigated the functions of linc - ror in ovarian cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo , and its roles in cell invasion and metastasis .
we demonstrate that the linc - ror - induced changes in emt in ovarian cancer cell lines are the result of alterations in the canonical wnt / beta - catenin signaling pathway .
this study explored a new regulatory mechanism for linc - ror in ovarian cancer invasion and metastasis , and provides new evidence for the therapeutic and prognostic value of linc - ror in ovarian cancer .
results linc - ror is up - regulated in human ovarian cancer tissues linc - ror mrna expression was assessed by quantitative real - time ( qrt ) - pcr and shown to be significantly higher in the 39 high - grade ovarian serous cancer tissue samples than in either the 20 normal ovarian tissue samples or the 20 normal fallopian tube tissue samples ( figure 1 , p < 0.01 ) .
table 1 shows the different levels of linc - ror expression in patients subdivided by figo phases .
linc - ror also showed a trend of increasing expression in patients with more advanced clinical phases of ovarian cancer ( p < 0.01 ) , while patients with lymph node metastases had higher linc - ror expression than those without ( p < 0.01 ) .
these results suggest that up - regulated linc - ror expression may be associated with ovarian carcinogenesis and tumor progression .
figure 1 linc - ror mrna expression by qrt - pcr in normal ovarian and fallopian tube tissues and high - grade ovarian serous cancer tissues the level of linc - ror expression in high - grade ovarian serous cancer tissues was significantly higher than in normal ovarian or normal fallopian tube tissues .

the levels of linc - ror expression after transfection were confirmed by qrt - pcr .
after sirna transfection , linc - ror expression was significantly lower in the si - linc - ror groups than in the si - nc group ( figure 2a , p < 0.05 ) ; linc - ror expression was significantly higher after transfecting the linc - ror expression plasmid than in cells transfected with empty vector ( figure 2b , p < 0.01 ) .
sirna - 1 had the best inhibitory effect on linc - ror expression , so we used it for subsequent experiments .

we then detected the proliferation rates of experimentally manipulated skov3 cells using the cck - 8 assay .
compared with the si - nc group , si - linc - ror - transfected cells showed significantly reduced proliferation rates ( figure 2c ) .
conversely , linc - ror overexpression significantly increased cell proliferation ( figure 2d ) .
similar results were obtained using a2780 cells ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
together , these results suggest that linc - ror may be an important regulator of proliferation in ovarian cancer cells in vitro .
linc - ror promotes migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cells we next investigated the biological effects of linc - ror on the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells .

moreover , transwell assays revealed that reducing linc - ror expression inhibited skov3 cell invasion ( figure 3c ) , while linc - ror overexpression remarkably stimulated invasion ( figure 3d ) .

ectopic linc - ror expression induces an emt program in skov3 cells to investigate the oncogenic role of linc - ror in ovarian cancer emt , we detected emt marker expression via western blotting .
levels of the epithelial marker e - cadherin were reduced in skov3 cells exogenously overexpressing linc - ror compared with cells transfected with empty vector .
accordingly , levels of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and the emt - associated proteins beta - catenin and c - myc were increased in linc - ror - overexpressing skov3 cells compared with cells carrying empty vector ( figure 4a ) .
conversely , e - cadherin expression was higher in linc - ror - silenced skov3 cells than in the control group , whereas vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc were prominently decreased in linc - ror - silenced skov3 cells compared with controls ( figure 4b ) .
these results suggest that linc - ror promotes emt in skov3 cells .
figure 4 linc - ror enhances emt in skov3 cells western blotting revealed decreased e - cadherin expression in linc - ror - overexpressing cells compared with cells in the empty vector group , whereas vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc were increased in the experimental group compared with controls ( a ) .
higher e - cadherin expression was detected in the sirna - 1 group compared with the nc group , whereas vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc were significantly decreased in the sirna - 1 group compared with the nc group ( b ) .

linc - ror promotes ovarian cancer tumor growth in vivo the emt process has been implicated in ovarian cancer metastasis .
to determine whether linc - ror could regulate tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer cells in vivo , we performed assays in immunodeficient mice .
skov3 - ror - lv , skov3 - ror - p , and control skov3 cells were inoculated to establish a subcutaneous xenograft model using nude mice .
compared with skov3 - ror - lv and control skov3 cells , mice inoculated with skov3 - ror - p cells formed larger xenograft tumors ( figure 5a - 5c ). by contrast , the skov3 - ror - lv cell group formed smaller tumors than the other groups .
assessment of linc - ror expression in xenograft tumors by qrt - pcr showed that it was clearly increased in skov3 - ror - p group tumors compared with other groups ( figure 5d ) .
this suggests that a high level of linc - ror can promote tumor growth .
consequently , the in vivo results indicate that linc - ror has a pivotal role in ovarian cancer tumor growth .
figure 5 linc - ror promotes tumor growth in nude mice ( a ) xenograft tumors were removed from nude mice and histological changes were shown ( x400 ) .
( b ) ror - p cell - derived xenograft tumors grew more quickly compared with ror - lv and control skov3 cell - derived tumors .
( c ) the mean weight of ror - p cell - derived xenograft tumors was significantly larger than ror - lv and control skov3 cell - derived tumors .
( d ) the expression level of linc - ror in samples of xenograft tumor .
linc - ror promotes emt by upregulating the wnt / beta - catenin pathway we have demonstrated that linc - ror overexpression or silencing changed the level of beta - catenin and c - myc expression ( figure 4 ) .
beta - catenin is a key protein in the canonical wnt / beta - catenin pathway and forms adherens junctions with e - cadherin ; c - myc is a wnt / beta - catenin pathway target gene .
we hypothesized that linc - ror may have triggered an emt program in ovarian cancer cells by upregulating wnt / beta - catenin signaling .
to independently determine the effect of wnt / beta - catenin signaling activation on skov3 cell proliferation and to determine the optimal licl ( a wnt / beta - catenin pathway activator ) dose to achieve this , we treated skov3 cells with different doses of licl for different lengths of time .
treatment with 24 - h 10 mm licl promoted more proliferation than the other tested doses and treatment times ( figure 6a ) .
therefore , we used 24 - h 10 mm licl in subsequent experiments .
e - cadherin was decreased and vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc were increased in 24 - h 10 mm licl - treated skov3 cells compared with untreated controls ( figure 6b ) .
linc - ror sirna was then transfected into the cells , and we subsequently detected increased e - cadherin and decreased vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc expression compared with the si - nc group ( figure 6c ) .
these results demonstrate that even when the wnt / beta - catenin pathway is exogenously activated by licl , silencing linc - ror expression can inhibit downstream effects of wnt / beta - catenin signaling .
therefore , we conclude that linc - ror promotes ovarian cancer emt at least in part by activating the wnt / beta - catenin pathway .
figure 6 linc - ror promotes emt in skov3 cells by activating the wnt / beta - catenin pathway skov3 cells were incubated with different concentrations of licl ( 0 , 10 , 20 , and 40 mm ) , and after 6 , 12 , and 24 h , the cck - 8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation .
cell proliferation was most strongly promoted by 10 mm licl treatment for 24 h ( a ) .
when treated with licl only , e - cadherin expression was decreased and vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc were increased compared with controls ( b ) .
when linc - ror was silenced following licl treatment , e - cadherin expression was increased and vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc were decreased compared with cells transfected with si - nc ( c ) .

discussion ovarian cancer is a malignant tumor that is dangerous to women 's health because it has the highest mortality rate among all malignancies of the female reproductive system .
one important reason for this is the strong invasive and metastatic abilities of ovarian cancer cells .
this study identified an oncogenic role for linc - ror in ovarian cancer development and metastasis .
our results indicated that linc - ror is highly expressed in high - grade ovarian serous cancer tissues , and that high linc - ror expression is associated with advanced figo stage and lymph node metastasis .
moreover , exogenously upregulating linc - ror expression in ovarian cancer cells promoted proliferation , migration , and invasion in vitro , and promoted tumor growth in immunodeficient mice in vivo .
we also discovered that linc - ror can induce emt to promote invasion and metastasis , and that the wnt / beta - catenin pathway may activate linc - ror - induced emt .
these results provide further evidence for the role of increased linc - ror expression in malignant ovarian cancer phenotypes .
linc - ror is a non - protein coding rna , approximately 2.6 kb in length that is located on chromosome 18q21.31 .
it was first identified in induced pluripotent stem cells , where it plays important roles in maintaining stem cell pluripotency [ 19 ] .
it was reported to mainly be expressed in the cytoplasm where it suppresses p53 translation through direct interaction with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein i in response to dna damage [ 25 ] .
in recent years , accumulating evidence has revealed that linc - ror is highly expressed in a variety of tumors , such as malignancies of the breast [ 21 ] , liver [ 22 ] , pancreas [ 23 ] and colon [ 24 ] .
high linc - ror expression is thought to enhance tumor growth , migration and invasion , promote emt , and / or influence the characteristics of cancer stem cells .
hou et al. found that linc - ror significantly enhanced the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells by acting as a molecular sponge for mir - 205 [ 21 ] .
additional studies have indicated that linc - ror regulates tumor stem cell differentiation , and promotes tumor cell proliferation , invasion and metastasis by regulating oct4 , sox2 , and nanog expression via interfering with micro rna - 145 [ 23 , 26 , 27 ] .
therefore , linc - ror appears to play a role in emt programs , which promotes the invasive and metastatic abilities of tumor cells .
other lncrnas have also been shown to be associated with ovarian cancer development and metastasis , including hotair , h19 , gas5 , and uca1 [ 15 - 18 ] ; however , to date , little was known about linc - ror in ovarian cancer .
we first examined linc - ror expression in samples of high - grade ovarian serous cancer tissue , normal ovarian tissue , and normal fallopian tube tissue .
linc - ror mrna was shown to be expressed at higher levels in high - grade ovarian serous cancer tissues than in normal ovarian or normal fallopian tube tissues .
analysis of suggested that patients with more advanced ovarian cancer ( those with an advanced figo stage ) have increased tumoral linc - ror expression ; furthermore , linc - ror expression was higher in ovarian cancer tissues from patients with than without lymph node metastases .
these results suggest that linc - ror may be associated with the development and metastasis of ovarian cancer .
to investigate the oncogenic role of linc - ror in ovarian cancer , we exogenously silenced or overexpressed linc - ror in ovarian cancer cells using sirna , or lentivirus and expression plasmids .
ectopically expressed linc - ror promoted proliferation in vitro and in vivo , contributed to cell migration and invasion , and inhibited the epithelial marker e - cadherin , while stimulating expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in an ovarian cancer cell line .
we also detected upregulated beta - catenin and c - myc in exogenously overexpressing linc - ror cells compared with control cells , providing further evidence that linc - ror induces emt in ovarian cancer cells .
these outcomes were reversed when linc - ror was silenced by sirna .
emt is one of the most important steps of tumor metastasis and plays a central role in tumor progression .
during this process , cells lose epithelial marker expression and instead express mesenchymal markers , which induces the loss of cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesion , and increases migratory , invasive , and stem cell properties [ 28 ] .
emt is essential for tumor invasion and metastasis , and embryonic development .
blechschmidt et al. found that e - cadherin and snail expression were negatively correlated in ovarian cancer .
the e - cadherin / snail ratio could therefore reflect the extent of malignancy for ovarian cancer because e - cadherin and snail expression is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis [ 29 ] .
gao et al. discovered that nac1 was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues , and that highly expressed nac1 decreases nuclear factor - kappab phosphorylation ( induced by the metastasis suppressor gene mkk4 ) and promotes twist expression , which then inhibits e - cadherin expression and induces emt in ovarian cancer cells ; in their experiments the invasive and metastatic abilities of ovarian cancer cells were accordingly enhanced [ 30 ] .
in our study , we found that linc - ror was associated with expression of the emt - associated markers e - cadherin , vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc in ovarian cancer cells .
therefore , linc - ror may be a key regulator of ovarian cancer emt and metastasis .
a variety of signaling pathways , including transforming growth factor - beta , mitogen - activated protein kinase , notch , and wnt , can trigger emt .
the canonical wnt / beta - catenin pathway has been proven to induce emt in ovarian cancer , breast cancer , and colon cancer cells [ 31 ] .
when the wnt / beta - catenin pathway is abnormally activated , adhesion between tumor cells is weakened , which induces emt and enhances the ability of tumor cells to invade and metastasize .
moreover , beta - catenin is a key protein in the wnt / beta - catenin pathway that forms adherens junctions together with e - cadherin [ 32 ] .
in our study , we found that beta - catenin expression was altered in response to experimental changes in linc - ror expression .
western blotting indicated that activation of the wnt / beta - catenin pathway led to a decrease in e - cadherin expression , and increased vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc expression .
however , following linc - ror silencing , e - cadherin was increased and vimentin , beta - catenin , and c - myc were decreased .
this demonstrates that even in a forced state of wnt / beta - catenin pathway activation , silencing linc - ror inhibits the downstream effects of wnt / beta - catenin signaling .
further experimentation confirmed that linc - ror triggered ovarian cancer cells to undergo emt through wnt / beta - catenin pathway activation .
thus , we conclude that linc - ror mediates the invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells at least in part by activating emt through wnt / beta - catenin signaling .
in conclusion , this study demonstrated that linc - ror is up - regulated in high - grade ovarian serous cancer tissues , where it promotes proliferation , invasion , and metastasis .
furthermore , we showed that linc - ror acts as a potential oncogene in ovarian cancer by initiating an emt program , and that the wnt / beta - catenin pathway may also be involved in this process .
these results suggest that linc - ror is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for ovarian cancer .

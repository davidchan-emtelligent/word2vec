trna - derived small rnas ( tdrs ) are a group of small , non - coding rnas derived from transfer rnas ( trnas ) .
they can be classified as trna halves and trna - derived small rna fragments ( trfs ) .
accumulating experimental evidence suggests their functional roles in cells and in various biological processes .
advances in next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) techniques allow a large amount of small rna deep - sequencing data to be generated .
to investigate tdrs from these data , software to identify tdrs and databases to retrieve or manage tdr data have been devised .
in this review , we summarized the tools and databases for tdr identification and collection , with the aim of helping researchers choose the best tools for their analysis and inspiring the invention or improvement of tools in the field .
next - generation sequencing trna - derived small rna trna halves trna - derived small rna fragments identification database 1 .
introduction the last decade witnessed the discovery of an enormous number of trna - derived small rnas ( tdrs ) in almost all branches of life [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 ] .
it has been suggested that these tdrs are not products of the random degradation of transfer rnas ( trnas ) , but are generated by precise processes .
accumulating experimental evidence suggests that they have important regulatory roles in translation , viral infections and tumor development [ 13,14,15,16,17,18 ] .
tdrs are classified as trna halves and trna - derived small rna fragments ( trfs ) .
trna halves are generated by a single cleavage at the anticodon of mature trnas , and their lengths range from 30 nt to 35 nt [ 1 ] .
the biogenesis of trna halves is mostly induced by stress , such as oxidative stress [ 1 ] .
trfs , however , are generated from both precursor ( pre - trnas ) and mature trnas through dicer - dependent or - independent processes , and are approximately 20 nt in size .
however , this classification of tdrs is not definite .
the features used to classify trna halves and tdrs are not unambiguous , and their functions and mechanisms overlap .
early studies investigated tdrs individually and revealed that they are highly expressed in cells [ 19 ] .
recently , deep sequencing tools have been developed to comprehensively detect tdrs in silico [ 20 ] .
the discovery of tdrs has raised the need for the storage and management of massive amounts of tdr data .
recent tdr identification tools and databases are mostly designed for eukaryotic cells .
consequently , in this review , we focus only on eukaryotic tdrs , and discuss the computational approaches and tools for identifying and managing the data for eukaryotic tdrs .
2. tdrs in eukaryotic cells , trna genes are transcribed by rna polymerase iii , and the resulting products ( precursor trnas or pre - trnas ) undergo further processing before maturation ( mature trnas ) .
these processes remove the 5 ' end ( 5 ' leader , by rnase p ) and the 3 ' end ( 3 ' trailer , by rnase z ) of pre - trnas and then add the 5 ' - cca - 3 ' ( cca ) trinucleotide to the 3 ' end of the trnas after cleavage .
the splicing of trna transcripts and the extensive chemical modification to generate non - canonical bases also occur with these processes [ 21,22,23 ] .
tdrs can be roughly classified as trna halves and trfs .
trna halves are formed by cleavage at the anticodon of mature trnas .
rny1p , a member of the rnase t2 family , and angiogenin , a member of the rnase a superfamily , are responsible for the cleavage to produce trna halves in yeast and mammalian cells , respectively [ 13,24,25 ] .
rny1p and angiogenin possess little substrate specificity .
rny1p is contained within the vacuole of the yeast cells and is released into the cytoplasm during stress - induced situations [ 26,27 ] .
angiogenin is secreted and endocytosed into the cytoplasm [ 28 ] .
typically , these enzymes are inhibited , and stress induces their release from the inhibitors [ 29 ] .
two groups of trna halves have been discovered , namely 5 ' halves and 3 ' halves [ 29 ] .
besides , sex hormone - dependent trna - derived rnas ( shot - rnas ) were found to be constitutively expressed in human breast and prostate cancers [ 17 ] .
they were considered trna halves , share counterparts of 5 ' and 3 ' halves , and possess biogenesis factors similar to those of trna halves .
however , the expression of shot - rnas is induced by sex hormones , and they are generated from trna species different from those of trna halves [ 17 ] .
diverse functional mechanisms of trna halves were suggested .
it has been shown that endogenous 5 ' trna halves inhibit translation through the displacement of elf4g / a ( eukaryotic translation initiation factors ) from the mrna transcripts [ 13,30 ] .
thompson and parker proposed four possible functional models of trna halves : the inhibition of translation through nicked trnas , the formation of a repression complex with other unknown proteins , guiding the inhibition of translation through their association with argonaute or piwi , and guiding the cleavage of mrnas via their interaction with the trna processing enzymes rnase z or rnase p [ 29 ] .
trfs , however , are produced from pre - trnas as well as mature trnas .
up until now , four types of trfs have been identified and characterized by their provenance on trnas : trf - 1s , trf - 5s , trf - 3s , and i - trfs .
trf - 1s result from the cleavage of 3 ' trailer fragments of precursor trnas by rnases , including dicer and rnase z [ 11,19,31 ] , and they usually begin exactly after the 3 ' - ends of mature trnas ( 5 ' - cca - 3 ' tails excluded ) and possess poly - us at their 3 ' - ends [ 19 ] .
trf - 5s are generated by cleavage in the d - loop of trnas by dicer , oftentimes with adenine as their 3 ' - ends [ 19,31 ] .
trf - 3s result from cleavage in the t - loop by dicer , angiogenin and other members of the rnase a superfamily and are fragments of the 3 ' end of mature trnas ( with cca at the 3 ' end ) ; the cleavage usually occurs between a / u and a / u near the 3 ' - end of the trnas [ 19,30,31 ] .
i - trfs are enriched within the internal regions of mature trnas , and they usually straddle the anticodon and begin right after the second or downstream nucleotide of the 5 ' - ends of trnas [ 32 ] .
recently , a previously undescribed 5 ' leader - exon trna fragment type was discovered to be associated with the loss of spinal motor neurons in clp1 - kinase dead mice [ 30,33 ] .
these fragments straddle the 5 ' leader sequence of pre - trnas and the 5 ' end of mature trnas .
the mechanism of the trf regulation of gene expression remains elusive .
trfs were shown to associate with argonautes similar to sirnas and mirnas and were thus assumed to silence gene expression [ 31,34 ] .
it has also been shown that the displacement of pro - oncogenic transcripts with trfs from the rna - binding protein ybx1 might account for the suppression of human breast cancer progression by the trfs [ 18 ] .
in addition , the trna 3 ' external transcribed spacers might be excised and function as a sponge to reduce noise in transcription [ 35 ] .
figure 1 shows the general pathways for tdr biogenesis .
the functions of tdrs are not well understood .
it was found that tdrs are correlated to the differentiation , development and metabolism of primitive eukaryotes [ 36,37 ] .
in the mouse , the mature sperm enrichment of tdrs was discovered , and the tdrs were thought to act as epigenetic factors or as regulators of endogenous retro - elements prior to implantation of the embryo [ 10,38,39 ] .
in humans , tdrs have been found in several human cancer cell lines , but their correlation to tumorigenesis and progression remains elusive [ 16,17,18,19,40,41,42 ] .
compared with those in animals , the tdrs in plants are less investigated .
tdrs were found to accumulate in the roots of arabidopsis thaliana or in the shoots of barley during phosphate deprivation [ 43,44 ] .
a more recent study revealed the existence of conserved tdrs in arabidopsis thaliana , oryza sativa and physcomitrella patens [ 45 ] .
3. identifying tdrs and managing tdr data research on tdrs requires tools that facilitate the identification or retrieval of information on trfs .
in general , studies on tdrs could be classified into three categories : identifying the tdrs ; analyzing tdr functions ; storing or managing and manipulating data .
computational approaches aimed at assisting researchers with these steps arose , and the following is a general review of the tools and databases for tdrs .
3.1 .
identifying tdrs in this review , three types of computational solutions to tdr identification will be summarized : general tools not specific to tdr identification in early studies , the command - line pipelines designed for tdr identification , and the integrated web server trf2cancer with user - friendly interfaces .
the main goal of small rna deep - sequencing data analysis is to find the source types of rnas and quantify their expression .
therefore , the mapping of reads is an important step .
early studies used blast [ 16,19,37,46,47 ] , bowtie / bowtie2 [ 48,49 ] , exonerate [ 40 ] , and the self - made string matching alignment algorithm to map small rnas from the ngs data and identify tdrs from them [ 50 ] .
recent studies began to raise concerns regarding the subtleties of mapping to the genome versus to the trna alone .
these concerns arose from the proposal of two different strategies to detect tdrs in 2015 : the strategy proposed by telonis et al. , and the tdrmapper developed by selitsky and sethupathy .
telonis et al. proposed to identify candidate trna - fragment reads by mapping them to the genome , whereas the tdrmapper maps the trimmed reads directly to trnas [ 32,50 ] .
telonis et al. mapped the reads to the whole genome and sought those reads with exact matches only to the trna sequences .
in particular , they allowed for only exact matches in mapping .
they claimed that with the limited lengths of tdrs and the sequence similarities among copies of trnas of the same anticodon , and even of different anticodons specifying the same amino acids , the allowance for mismatches might possibly confound the origins of tdrs. with regard to the requirements of exact matches , the three nucleotides immediately downstream of the 3 ' ends of trnas are replaced by cca prior to mapping , to reserve cca - trinucleotide - tail containing reads .
additionally , they permitted multiple hits on genomic trnas and retained the reads spanning exon - exon junctions but not those stepping partially on the introns .
in their study , they identified a fourth class of trfs , i - trfs , and encouraged scepticism to the rationality of mapping the reads to the trna space alone in trf identification .
however , this study did not provide off - the - shelf software [ 32 ] .
almost at the same time , selitsky and sethupathy released tdrmapper , a command - line tool for the identification , naming and quantification of tdrs [ 50 ]. of particular note is that tdrmapper adopted an " error type " hierarchical alignment scheme to handle possible mismatches attributed to chemical modifications .
in each step , tdrmapper takes the reads that were unmapped in the last step as inputs .
the inputs are then aligned with pre - trnas or trnas with some defined requirements , such as exact matches with mature or pre - trnas , as one to two mismatches or one to three base pair deletions with mature trnas .
the resulting mappable reads in each step are collected , annotated and quantified as candidate trfs .
the striking difference between the strategy of telonis et al. and tdrmapper is whether or not the reads are mapped to the reference genome .
in tdrmapper , the incomplete annotations of trna genes in the genome and the computational capacity are mentioned as reasons for not mapping to the genome .
specifically , reads mappable to both trnas and other regions in the genome are possibly indicative of new unannotated trna loci but are not reads derived from genomic templates other than trnas [ 50 ] .
in contrast , telonis et al. proposed that , due to trna lookalikes of nuclear and mitochondrial trnas and partial trna sequences , the reads mappable both to trnas and other known non - trna sequences should be excluded because their origins are dubious .
accounting for the number of loci in the genome with lengths and sequences similar to known trnas , the mapping to trnas alone would generate higher false positives and exaggerate the expression of certain trfs from given trnas [ 32,50 ] .
thus , all these controversies can be reduced to the balance between obtaining false positive and false negative results [ 51 ] .
tdrmapper aimed at identifying more potential trfs at the cost of increased false positives , whereas the telonis study aimed at providing more accurate trfs and excluded reads that were unlikely to derive from trnas .
to strike a balance between the total inclusion and total exclusion of dubious reads , we recently designed trf2cancer , an integrated web server for identifying trfs from small rna sequencing data and evaluating their expression in cancers [ 48 ] .
trf2cancer consists of trffinder ( trf identification from small rna deep - sequencing reads ) , trfincancer ( inspect expression of trfs across cancer types ) and trfbrowser ( origins and chemical modifications of trfs ) .
prior to mapping , trffinder maps the processed reads to the human genome and human transcript sequences to remove exogenous reads and reads other than trfs ( such as mrnas , mirnas , snornas , snrnas , rrnas and repeats ) .
this step helps to reduce the false positive results derived from non - trf reads .
trffinder then maps the reads to trna sequences to reduce false negative results .
to evaluate the enrichment of reads on trnas after mapping , a binomial test was introduced .
although mismatches and indels are allowed in mapping by making use of bowtie / bowtie2 , trffinder is cautious , and a scoring scheme was introduced .
in this scheme , reads with mismatches or indels are given lower scores than those with exact matches , and mismatches resulting from chemical modifications are thus distinguished by way of differing scores .
trffinder is the first web - based , user - friendly tool for the identification of trfs .
it strikes a balance between the total inclusion and total exclusion of dubious reads by giving reads of sceptical origins a lower score .
trffinder is designed specifically for identifying human trfs and their expression in multiple types of cancers .
at the current stage , it only provides the web - based version for researchers to upload their sequencing data to the server ; the command - line version is under development .
table 1 shows the comparison between the work of telonis et al. , tdrmapper and trffinder .
to conclude , identifying trfs from random degradation will remain a challenge .
in addition to probability - based methods for evaluating the enrichment of reads on the genome or trnas , machine - learning algorithms might prove promising .
in microrna identification , machine - learning - based methods have been adopted to identify micrornas based on known sequences and structural properties [ 52 ] .
in addition , the lengths or cleavage site preferences are features that might be used in machine - learning - based methods to identify tdrs .
3.2 .
databases of tdrs databases of trfs help researchers obtain trf sequences and evaluate expression counts in multiple experiments [ 47 ] .
however , only a limited number of trf databases are available in the field .
in this review , four databases are introduced : trfdb , trfincancer ( in the trf2cancer ) , mintbase , and the olvedy et al. repertoire of prostate cancer .
trfdb is a relational database of trfs and other trna - related rna fragments [ 47 ] .
trfdb contains trf records from eight species ranging from bacteria to human .
the database provides a uniform nomenclature and unique trf id for the trfs .
trfdb provides information on trf ( original organisms , type , source trnas , sequence ) and samples that contain the corresponding trf reads , with interfaces to the geo ( gene expression omnibus ) and sra ( sequence read archive ) database .
in addition , trfdb displays the distribution of reads on trna sequences .
to construct the database , trfdb mapped the reads from the geo / sra database to the trna sequences , and the reads that were enriched in the trna sequences were further mapped to the whole genomes to exclude those reads mappable to outside trnas .
the database contains trf records from eight species , and therefore , it is suitable for research on trf evolution or comparisons among species .
however , the database contains only records of trf - 5s , trf - 3s , trf - 1s ; it contains no records of i - trfs or other tdrs .
furthermore , all the records in the database are results of bioinformatic prediction and require further experimental validation .
trfincancer is a database for viewing the expression of trfs in multiple cancer types [ 48 ] .
in trfincancer , the trfs are predicted from tcga ( the cancer genome atlas ) data that contain the small rna deep - sequencing data of 32 human cancer types and subtypes .
the trfs are identified using the trffinder .
one feature of trfincancer is that users can determine the expression of trfs in 32 cancer types ; through comparisons of the expression in multiple cancers , researchers might be able to spot correlations between cancers and trf expression levels .
we hope that trfincancer can provide a starting point for functional studies of trfs and their correlation with cancers .
trfs can be generated from both nuclear trnas as well as mitochondrial trnas [ 53 ] .
mintbase is a database for trfs of mitochondrial and nuclear origin [ 54 ] .
in mintbase , users can access five types of tdrs : trf - 5s , trf - 3s , i - trfs , 5 ' - halves and 3 ' - halves of mitochondrial and nuclear origin .
different from the probability - based search methods used by trfdb , mintbase adopted the deterministic and exhaustive approach to search for all possible trf candidates and retain those fragments mappable exclusively to trnas .
in mintbase , two methods are provided to users to view trfs .
users can select and view trfs according to trf types , precursor trnas , and the precursor trna anticodon .
users can also search trfs by trna names , fragment sequence , and by fragment label ( defined by mintbase ) .
in addition to ordinary information on trfs ( i.e. , sequence information , expression information , parental trna information and genomic information ) , based on the results page returned by mintbase , users can view trfs by five so - termed " vistas " : genomic loci , rna molecule , trna alignment , expression and summary .
the two most striking features of mintbase are that ( 1 ) it provides all - inclusive information on exhaustive trf species of nuclear or mitochondrial origin and that ( 2 ) it provides interfaces for the submission of new trf records .
the ability to submit new records is important for updating a database .
currently , all the trf records in mintbase are produced from bioinformatic prediction and need to be validated by experiments in the future .
olvedy et al. designed a repertoire of trfs that focused exclusively on prostate cancer [ 55 ] .
in the study , they examined and identified differentially expressed trfs and their compositions in clinical prostate cancer samples representing different stages of the cancer .
they also quantified the expression of trfs across samples .
the study provides a comprehensive catalogue ( termed " database ") of trfs in different stages of prostate cancer ; however , it does not provide a user - friendly interface .
as mentioned , trfdb and mintbase contain almost all tdr records in a given species , but do not provide a more focused view of tdrs in certain diseases .
trfincancer offers options to view the expression of a given tdr across cancer types , which makes comparisons among cancers convenient ; however , it does not provide a general overview of all tdrs in a given disease .
the olvedy et al. repertoire , however , is helpful for users to view the expression of tdrs in a given disease , namely prostate cancer .
therefore , the olvedy et al. repertoire complemented by trfincancer might be helpful to researchers in that they offer a comprehensive view of tdr expression and their correlation to diseases .
a comparison between the databases is shown in table 2 .
4. perspectives tdrs are experiencing intense research , and their biological functions are gradually being revealed .
currently , off - the - shelf computational tools for identifying these small rnas and databases to manage their information are available .
however , as an integrated field of tdrs , many other areas of study are in need of tools for the analysis of tdrs .
three notable fields are the prediction of targets of tdrs , the study of their correlation to diseases , and the study of circulating tdrs .
currently , there are no tools for target prediction of tdrs .
in retrospect , clip - seq ( cross - linking and argonaute immunoprecipitation coupled with high - throughput sequencing ) can be used to search for microrna targets utilizing the microrna : mrna interaction mediated by argonaute ( ago ) proteins [ 56,57,58 ] , and databases for these data are present ( for instance , starbase [ 59,60 ]) .
similar techniques have been applied to study tdr : rna interactions ; for instance , meta - analysis of data generated by par - clip ( photoactivatable - ribonucleoside - enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation ) , clash ( crosslinking , ligation , and sequencing of hybrids ) and hits - clip ( high - throughput sequencing of rna isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation , also referred to as clip - seq ) revealed the trf association preferences for agos and mrnas [ 46,61 ] .
these are promising methods to unravel the interactive dynamics between tdrs and their target proteins or rnas .
tools to analyze and manage these data can facilitate the exploration of tdr biological functions by providing information on the targets of tdrs .
insufficient tools are in place for the study of the correlations between tdrs and diseases .
in retrospect , there are two dimensions in the study of correlations between tdrs and some given diseases .
the first dimension highlights that given a sample from a disease of interest , the expression of different tdrs in this sample is detected to assess the up - or down - regulation of tdrs and to determine their expression patterns [ 16,19,40,41,42 ] .
this dimension gives the overall patterns of tdr expression in the disease and offers some indications on the interactive dynamics between tdrs .
this dimension of study requires pipelines and databases that focus on the disease under study , and olvedy et al. ' s repertoire is one example of this type of database [ 55 ] .
the raw deep - sequencing data and analysis results provided by the tdr studies in different diseases , and the use of bioinformatic pipelines to predict tdrs from small rna deep - sequencing data from samples of different diseases , are resources to build this type of database .
the second dimension highlights the cross - comparison of tdr expression profiles in different types of diseases that can be used to study whether up - or down - regulation of the given tdrs is common to all related diseases or is unique to one specific case .
this dimension indicates the potential of tdrs as diagnostic biomarkers in disease detection .
one example of this type of database is trfincancer , which enables users to compare the expression of the tdr of interest in multiple cancers [ 48 ] .
the first dimension lacks databases or computational pipelines that focus on the diseases under study , and the second dimension requires more inclusive databases .
more work is required to tailor the pipelines or databases on the tdr for adequate study of diseases .
accumulating evidence suggests the presence of circulating , functional tdrs in mouse serum [ 62,63 ] , dairy cows [ 63,64 ] , and humans [ 25,63,65 ] .
the functions of circulating tdrs are not well characterized , and their potential as diagnostic biomarkers remains to be elucidated .
in view of this , the databases to collect tdrs from circulating small rna fragments from normal or disease samples , by bioinformatic prediction or collection of results from previous studies , might be helpful to the study of circulating tdrs .
in addition to new requirements from novel fields of study , several problems in the recent development of pipelines and databases remain .
to systematically study tdrs and facilitate communication in the literature , it is important to establish a standard nomenclature for tdrs .
however , the nomenclatures of tdrs are inconsistent among the different tools and different databases [ 48,50,53 ] .
the difficulties of establishing a standardized trf nomenclature lie in that only a small fraction of tdrs are validated by experiments .
in addition , the origin of tdrs cannot be deterministically traced to one particular precursor trna due to trna isotypes ; some common sequence motifs are shared among trnas with different anticodons coding for the same amino acid , and even allowing for one mismatch / insertion / deletion would probably confound the origin of tdrs .
thus , before establishing a uniform nomenclature for tdr , more research is needed to identify methods to trace tdrs back to their trna precursors .
chemical modifications on trnas affect the rt - pcr amplification of tdrs and thus the false positive rates of tools in the field .
extensive chemical modifications of the small rnas would abort the reverse transcription in rt - pcr and thus generate truncated reads whose 3 ' ends overlap exactly with these sites [ 66,67 ] .
additionally , reverse transcriptase might pause at the chemically modified sites , which would enhance the likelihood of inserting the wrong nucleotides at these sites .
therefore , chemical modifications of the trnas and the corresponding tdrs might lead to increased truncated reads and higher chances of mismatch .
however , recent computational tools to identify tdrs rarely take into account the effect of chemical modifications .
to reduce the effect of truncated reads on identification , in trffinder we discarded the prediction results of tdrs whose 3 ' ends overlap with the chemically modified sites [ 48 ] .
it is more difficult to address the problem of mismatch from chemical modifications .
trffinder introduces the scoring matrix to distinguish the sources of mismatches .
if the mismatches occur at the sites of chemical modification , 0.5 point per site is subtracted from the total score , and 1 point per site otherwise [ 48 ] .
telonis et al. prevented mismatch from mapping reads to the genome , indicating that even one mismatch might confound the origin of tdrs [ 32,50 ] .
this might introduce high false negative rates , since mismatches resulting from chemical modifications prevent the true tdr reads from mapping .
however , tdrmapper allowed mismatches according to a hierarchical alignment scheme , which might confound mismatches of different origins .
to address this contradiction , mismatches of different origins should be set apart , and in trffinder , a scoring scheme could help [ 48 ] .
there are also new sequencing methods to handle the effect of chemical modifications .
for instance , the alkb - facilitated rna methylation sequencing ( arm - seq ) method treats the samples with de - alkylating enzymes to remove methylations from trnas before rt - pcr [ 66 ] .
this way , the effect of chemical modifications can be eliminated at the beginning , and rt - pcr can provide more accurate reads representative of small rnas .
nowadays , computational tdr tools mainly focus on identification and databases .
the introduction of more reliable computational and statistical methods , or novel methods based on machine learning , is desired to accurately identify tdrs from small rna sequencing data .
besides , more specialized databases are also expected to satisfy the diverse requirements of the researchers .
in addition , new fields of study on tdrs are growing , while the tools are lacking in these fields .
so the development of novel computational methods for tdr research will be a challenging but fruitful endeavour .

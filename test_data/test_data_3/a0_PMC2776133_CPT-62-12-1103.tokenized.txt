background : due to the potential risk of iron supplementation in iron replete children , it is important to properly identify children who may require iron supplementation .
however , assessment of the iron status has proven to be difficult , especially in children living in areas with high infection pressure ( including malaria ) .
aims and methods : biochemical iron markers were compared to bone marrow iron findings in 381 malawian children with severe anaemia .
results : soluble transferrin receptor / log ferritin ( tfr - f index ) , using a cut - off of 5.6 , best predicted bone marrow iron stores deficiency ( sensitivity 74 % , specificity 73 % , accuracy 73 %) .
in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin or stfr as a stand - alone marker , the normal cut - off value needed to be increased by 810 % and 83 % respectively .
mean cell haemoglobin concentration ( mchc ) , using a cut - off of 32.1 g / dl , had a sensitivity of 67 % and specificity of 64 % for detecting iron stores deficiency .
conclusion : tfr - f index incorporated the high sensitivity of stfr , a proxy for cellular iron need , and the high specificity of ferritin , a proxy for iron stores .
in areas with a high infection pressure , the tfr - f index best predicted iron deficiency .
however , in settings where diagnostic tests are limited , mchc may be an acceptable alternative screening test .
the examination of stained aspirates of bone marrow for haemosiderin has been considered the " gold standard " as a method for evaluation of iron status.1 this technique is invasive and therefore not suitable for screening .
there are currently several laboratory assays available for assessing the iron status in children .
these are widely used in clinics and include ferritin , serum iron , serum transferrin , total iron binding capacity ( tibc ) and mean cell volume ( mcv ) .
however , these iron markers are considerably altered by inflammation , which limits their applicability , especially in areas with a high infection pressure .
surprisingly , it is still unclear to what extent adjustment of the recommended cut - off values for these iron markers is required in order to improve their diagnostic efficiency .
to date there are no studies which have validated these iron markers against the " gold standard " ( bone marrow iron content ) in children living in areas endemic for malaria and other common infective conditions .
in areas with a limited infection pressure , soluble transferrin receptor ( stfr ) has been shown to be a promising new tool for the diagnosis of deficiency of iron stores.2 due to a recent finding in tanzania of an increased mortality in iron replete children receiving iron supplementation , there is an urgent need to be able to target iron therapy and prophylaxis programmes on the children with proven iron deficiency.3 to be able to do this there is a need for non - invasive and sensitive tests that distinguish iron stores deficiency from functional iron deficiency which is associated with anaemia of inflammation .
we have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of various iron markers against bone marrow iron assessment in children residing in an area of high infection pressure .
methods this study formed part of a large case - control study investigating the aetiology of severe anaemia among malawian children described in detail elsewhere.4 in summary , the study was conducted between july 2002 and july 2004 in malaria endemic areas of blantyre and chikwawa .
children aged 6 - 59 months , presenting to hospital with severe anaemia ( hb < 5 g / dl ) were enrolled as cases .
written informed consent was obtained from the guardians of the children , and the study was approved by the ethics committees of the university of malawi and the liverpool school of tropical medicine , uk. clinical assessment and management children had a detailed medical examination performed before collecting a sample of venous blood .
under local anaesthesia , a bone marrow aspiration was performed from the anterior or posterior iliac crest .
all bone marrows were performed in the presence of the child 's guardian and she / he was allowed to withdraw consent at any time during the procedure .
all children received a blood transfusion and were managed according to standard hospital protocols.4 laboratory methods on recruitment , haematological indices ( including haemoglobin ( hb ) , mean cell volume ( mcv ) and mean cell haemoglobin concentration ( mchc )) were determined using the hemocue b - haemoglobin ( hemocue ab , angelholm , sweden ) and a coulter counter analyser ( beckman coulter , durban , south africa ) .
ferritin , serum iron and serum transferrin were also assayed ( roche diagnostics , switzerland ) .
stfr was measured using an enzyme immunoassay ( ramco laboratories , texas , usa ) .
blood was cultured for 5 and 56 days for the presence of routine pathogens and mycobacteria , respectively , using an automated bact / alert system ( biomerieux industry , missouri , usa ) .
definitions and cut - off values malaria was defined as presence of plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites in blood .
hiv testing was done using two rapid tests according to who guidelines and discordant results were resolved by pcr.5 internationally accepted cut - off values for biochemical iron markers used in this analysis were as follows : ferritin < 30 mug / l6 ; serum iron < 3.6 mumol / l ; serum transferrin > 3.6 g / l ; tibc > 72 mumol / l ( laboratory reference values ) ; transferrin saturation < 16 % 6 ; stfr > 8.3 mg / l ( test kit reference value ) ; mcv < 67 fl (< 2 years old ) and < 73 fl ( 2 - 5 years old ) ; mchc < 32 g / l.6 transferrin - ferritin ( tfr - f ) index was defined as [ stfr / log ferritin ]. 7 a tfr - f index value of > 5.6 ( using stfr of > 8.3 mg / l and ferritin of < 30 mug / l ) was used to define deficiency of iron stores.8 c - reactive protein ( crp ) of > 10 mg / ml was defined as increased.9 bone marrow aspirates were prepared and stained using a commercial kit and according to manufacturer guidelines ( hematognost fe , darmstadt , germany ) .
smears were graded for iron and defined as positive when the fragment iron was < 2.8 bone marrow iron assessment was used as the gold standard for diagnosis of iron stores deficiency .
statistical analysis for sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( ppv ) , negative predictive value ( npv ) and accuracy for individual iron markers was calculated using spss v.11.0 .
iron markers having either a sensitivity or specificity < 20 % were classified as poor predictors of iron stores deficiency and were dropped from further analysis .
for the remaining iron markers , receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) curves for identifying the optimal cut - offs for best identifying iron stores deficiency were constructed , and the corresponding areas under the curve ( aucroc ) for all the markers were compared .
a new cut - off for each iron marker which provided maximal sensitivity and specificity was determined from roc curves.10 ksp analysed the data but all others had access to the primary dataset .
results a total of 381 children were recruited with an average age of 1.7 years ( sd 1.1 ) ; 46.7 % ( 178 / 381 ) were male ( table 1 ) .
sixty per cent of severely anaemic children had malaria parasites in their blood ; crp was raised in 89 % .
ferritin levels were increased , with a mean concentration of 729.2 ( 1528.1 ) mug / l ( table 2 ) .
the proportions of children that were iron deficient ranged from 1 % using tibc to 97.5 % using serum transferrin .

table 3 shows sensitivity and specificity of various iron markers .
poor markers that were dropped from further analysis included serum transferrin , tibc and mcv , which had a sensitivity of 0 % , 0 % and 4 % (< 2 years ) and 17 % (<= 2 years ) , respectively .
ferritin , serum iron and transferrin saturation had a markedly lower sensitivity than specificity .
conversely , stfr had a high sensitivity of 90 % and low specificity of 37 % .
the accuracy of a marker was highest for ferritin ( 79 %) and lowest for stfr ( 49 %) .

roc curves for defining the optimal cut for the identification of deficiency of iron stores for ferritin , stfr , tfr - f index , and other iron markers were constructed ( fig 1 ) .
the area under the curve ( aucroc ) for each marker represented their performance ( table 4 ) .
ferritin , stfr , tfr - f index and mchc had significantly higher aucroc than 0.5 , where 0.5 signified an ineffective test .
serum iron and transferrin saturation were excluded from further analysis as they had non - significant aucroc ( 0.62 and 0.60 , respectively ) .

for the remaining iron markers , ferritin , stfr , tfr - f index and mchc , new cut - off levels , with an optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity , were determined from the roc curves .
table 5 shows the resultant sensitivity and specificity , and the percentage change from the original cut - off .
the ability of stfr or ferritin to predict iron stores deficiency ( accuracy ) was similar and above 75 % using the derived cut - offs of 273 mug / l and 15.2 mug / ml , respectively .
although the sensitivity and specificity for tfr - f index or mchc ( sensitivity 74 % , 67 % ; and specificity 73 % , 64 % , respectively ) were lower than those for ferritin and stfr , they required smaller changes from their original to new cut - off levels .

discussion in the present study , the diagnostic efficiency of stfr and a variety of more conventional laboratory tests for the identification of deficiency of iron stores or functional deficiency was evaluated .
the results suggested that serum transferrin , tibc and transferrin saturation were of limited value in diagnosis of deficiency of iron stores as their corresponding aucroc values did not provide acceptable sensitivity and specificity estimates .
most likely , this relates to the interference of inflammatory cytokines produced as part of the acute phase response during an infection.11 12 the bone marrow iron smear was used as the " gold standard " for the diagnosis of deficiency of iron stores .
it has generally been considered the most reliable diagnostic test , but has the limitations of being more invasive than peripheral blood iron markers.1 furthermore , incorrect assessment of iron stores in bone marrow aspirates has been described.13 ferritin has been widely used as an iron marker in individuals without inflammatory conditions.6 conversely , stfr is considered to reflect the degree of tissue iron need , and there is evidence that it is a good indicator of iron status when the iron stores are depleted.14 the reciprocal relationship between stfr and ferritin describes a perfect log - linear relationship over a wide range of normal and depleted iron stores states .
punnonen et al7 evaluated various possibilities of combinations of stfr and ferritin parameters , and concluded that use of the stfr / log ferritin ratio ( tfr - f index ) considerably improved diagnostic efficiency , even in settings with a high infection pressure .
in the present study , serum ferritin had a high specificity and stfr a high sensitivity , which is consistent with previous studies.15 changing the current conventional cut - off of tfr - f index ( 5.6 ) to its optimal cut - off ( according to the roc analysis ) of 5.3 has little effect on its diagnostic efficiency .
this is in contrast with ferritin and stfr which required a change of 810 % and 80 % , respectively , to achieve maximal sensitivity and specificity .
during a study in which healthy volunteers were serially phlebotomised to induce iron deficiency , mchc was found to be a sensitive early indicator of iron deficient erythropoiesis.16 17 in the present study , mchc had a relatively good diagnostic efficiency .
this is relatively good news since mchc can be measured using a coulter counter , which is relatively cheap and more widely available in resource - limited settings as compared with either ferritin or stfr .
results from the present study suggest that it is necessary to change the cut - off limit for ferritin from 30 to 273 mug / l in order to improve its diagnostic efficiency .
this proposed increase is consistent with other studies and probably reflects the effect of the acute phase response on ferritin levels.7 witte et al18 developed a nomogram describing the relationship between ferritin and crp or erythrocyte sedimentation rate , to detect or exclude iron deficiency in patients with anaemia of inflammation in order to minimise bone marrow examination .
unfortunately , when this nomogram , which corrected for the acute phase component of changes in ferritin , was applied in later studies , it performed poorly.19 results from the present study indicates that ferritin and stfr are relatively good markers for detecting iron stores deficiency provided that new cut - off values are applied .
combining these markers into the tfr - f index may prove to be a much better tool to detect iron deficiency in children in these high infection pressure areas .
the cut - off values for the tfr - f index are robust and do not need to be adjusted for inflammation .
our study is among the largest and most detailed investigations into assessment of the iron status in children in this setting and has generated a unique dataset .
however , the fact that we did not do a healthy population - based study , but focused on a subgroup of severely anaemic children , may limit generalisability of our findings , especially in view of the fact that these children also tend to have other inflammatory conditions that may affect interpretation of ferritin levels .
obvious ethical issues , of performing bone marrow investigations in mild and non - anaemic children , was the main reason for focusing on this study population .
however , these findings may be a starting point and may provide an improved knowledge of diagnostic criteria for iron status assessment that avoids the need to do a bone marrow aspiration , and be of value for determining therapeutic practice .
this is especially important taken the recent observations that iron supplementation to iron replete children may be fatal.3 take - home messages there is a need to properly diagnose true iron deficiency due to the probable increased risk of adverse effects associated with iron supplementation in iron replete individuals .
transferrin - ferritin index is probably the most useful and robust iron marker that best predicts bone marrow iron status .
mean cell haemoglobin concentration may be an acceptable alternative screening test in resource - poor settings .

smoked cigarette filters are the predominant coastal litter item ; 4.5 trillion are littered annually , presenting a source of bioplastic microfibres ( cellulose acetate ) and harmful toxicants to marine environments .
despite the human health risks associated with smoking , little is known of the hazards cigarette filters present to marine life .
here we studied the impacts of smoked cigarette filter toxicants and microfibres on the polychaete worm hediste diversicolor ( ragworm ) , a widespread inhabitant of coastal sediments .
ragworms exposed to smoked cigarette filter toxicants in seawater at concentrations 60 fold lower than those reported for urban run - off exhibited significantly longer burrowing times , > 30 % weight loss , and > 2 - fold increase in dna damage compared to ragworms maintained in control conditions .
in contrast , ragworms exposed to smoked cigarette filter microfibres in marine sediment showed no significant effects .
bioconcentration factors for nicotine were 500 fold higher from seawater than from sediment .
our results illustrate the vulnerability of organisms in the water column to smoking debris and associated toxicants , and highlight the risks posed by smoked cigarette filter debris to aquatic life .
marine debris is a global conservation issue1 .
semi - synthetic bioplastic ( rayon ) and plastic materials are widely reported in the marine environment2 .
environmental exposure causes these materials to degrade and fragment , resulting in micron - sized particles and fibres < 1 mm ( e.g. microplastics ) 3 .
fibres are the most frequently reported type of particulate debris , not just in coastal ecosystems , but in deep ocean sediments where recent estimates suggest over 2 billion rayon fibres km2 contaminate the seabed2 .
smoked cigarette filters - the predominant item reported globally in coastal litter surveys - present a substantial source of rayon microfibres ; each filter is comprised of > 15,000 cellulose acetate ( rayon ) fibres , 20 mum in diameter45 .
approximately 4.5 trillion smoked cigarette filters , equivalent to > 750,000 tonnes , are littered to the environment annually4 .
despite the anti - littering laws operative in many countries , enforcement at the individual - level is impractical and has proved ineffective in preventing this debris from accumulating in the environment4 .
smoked cigarette filters can cause harm in the marine environment in several ways .
they present a vector for the transport and introduction of toxicants , including heavy metals , nicotine and known carcinogens6 , to aquatic habitats .
exposure to such toxicants in seawater could occur following the dissolution of compounds from the bioplastic filter to the surrounding seawater ( leaching ) .
dietary exposure could occur through the ingestion of smoked cigarette filter microfibers due to filter degradation .
if ingested , there is potential for the transfer of adhered toxicants to tissues .
these bioplastic microfibres and their associated toxicants may persist in the marine environment and continue leaching chemicals for up to 10 years4 .
despite this , few studies have assessed their potential toxicity .
this is particularly important in coastal sediments , where smoked cigarette filters dominate litter78 .
sediment is a vital component of the marine environment , forming one the largest habitats on earth .
its diverse residents are fundamental to marine ecosystem function , impacting water column processes ; trophic transfer ; and global biogeochemical cycles9 .
polychaete worms are widespread and abundant inhabitants of coastal sediments , where they rework and irrigate sediment and form a key prey species for birds and fish1011 .
they adopt a range of feeding strategies , including surface deposit feeding1112 , and are thus vulnerable to smoked cigarette filter debris and toxicants via both oral and dermal exposure pathways .
for the first time we explore the impacts of smoked cigarette filter toxicants and microfibres on the polychaete worm hediste diversicolor ( ragworm ) .
we address the hypotheses that 1 ) exposure to toxicants desorbed from smoked cigarette filters affects the behaviour and physiology of ragworms , and that 2 ) smoked cigarette filter microfibres present a physical hazard and / or vector for these associated toxicants .
we measure this by quantifying the relative growth rate , burrowing time and level of dna damage in ragworms exposed to smoked cigarette filter toxicants in seawater or microfibres in sediment , in relation to the bioaccumulation of the biomarker nicotine and its metabolite cotinine .
results nicotine bioaccumulation nicotine and its metabolite cotinine were used as biomarkers of exposure to the toxicants associated with smoked cigarette filters ( from here on referred to as filters ) .
nicotine was detected in whole - ragworm tissue following all exposures ( see table 1 ) .
after 96 h , the greatest levels of nicotine were measured in ragworms exposed to the highest concentrations of both filter toxicants in seawater ( 119,654 ng g - 1 tissue , bioconcentration factor ( bcfaqu ) of 172.4 ) and microfibres in sediment ( 3,629 ng g - 1 tissue , bioconcentration factor ( bcfsed ) of 0.338 ) ( see table 1 and fig. 1c,d ) .
ragworms accumulated several orders of magnitude less nicotine following both short - and long - term ( 854 ng g - 1 tissue , bcfsed of 0.123 ) sediment exposures to filter microfibres than following exposure to filter toxicants in seawater ( fig. 1d and supplementary fig. 2a ) .
the average cigarette contains 0.8 - 1.9 mg of nicotine .
for comparison , this delivers a human dose when smoked of 10 - 30 mug kg - 1 based on an average adult weight of 68 kg , resulting in average peak plasma levels of 10 - 50 ng ml - 1 13 ( see table 2 ) .
nicotine metabolism the nicotine metabolite cotinine was detected in all ragworms following exposure to filter toxicants in seawater ( fig. 1c ) .
nicotine : cotinine ratios of worm tissues dramatically increased with filter concentration ; worms exposed to 8 filters l - 1 had the greatest ratio ( 792 , see table 1 ) .
following a 96 h sediment exposure to filter microfibres , cotinine was detected in ragworms exposed to 2 filters l - 1 and above ( fig. 1d ) .
the greatest nicotine : cotinine ratio was measured in ragworms exposed to 2 filters l - 1 ( 76.6 , table 1 ) .
after 28 d in sediment , cotinine was detected in ragworms exposed to 4 filters l - 1 and above ( see table 2 and supplementary fig. 2a ) .
the nicotine : cotinine ratio was 67.2 and 61 , for 4 and 8 filters l - 1 , respectively .
these are similar to the ratios observed in worms exposed to microfibres in sediment over 96 h. these ratios indicate a reduced bioavailability of nicotine via microfibres in the sediment in comparison to filter toxicants in seawater .
biological endpoints relative growth rate relative growth rate ( rgr ) was measured as a general health indicator .
a significant effect on rgr was observed in ragworms following exposure to filter toxicants in seawater ( one - way anova , p = 0.00005 , fig. 2a ) .
the lowest concentration to cause a significant effect ( loec ) on rgr was 8 filters l - 1 ( - 33 % mean weight +/ - 2 % s.e.m. ) .
following 96 h and 28 d sediment exposures to filter microfibres , no effect on the rgrs of ragworms was observed ( fig. 2b and supplementary fig. 2b , respectively ) .
burrowing activity given the neurotoxicity of nicotine13 , we selected burrowing time as a primary sublethal endpoint .
exposure to the two highest concentrations of filter toxicants in seawater ( 4 and 8 filters l - 1 ) inhibited the burrowing capacity of 100 % of individuals during the assay observation period ( fig. 2c ) .
the loec for the burrowing time of ragworms exposed to filter toxicants in seawater was 2 filters l - 1 ( kruskal wallis , p = 0.0001 ) .
following a 96 h sediment exposure to filter microfibres , the loec for burrowing time was 8 filters l - 1 ( one - way anova , p = 0.04 , fig. 2d ) .
post hoc analysis showed that this result was significant at a confidence level of 0.1 ( tukey hsd test , p = 0.07 ) .
the burrowing time of ragworms following 28 d sediment exposure to filter microfibres was not affected ( supplementary fig. 2c ) .
dna damage exposure to filter toxicants in seawater significantly affected the median , 75th , and 90th percentile tail moment ( tm , a measure of dna fragmentation , see methods ) of ragworms ( one - way anova , p = 0.016 , p = 0.003 , and p = 0.003 , respectively ) .
ragworms exposed to 8 filters l - 1 had significantly greater tms than those exposed to 0.5 , 2 , and 4 filters l - 1 ( fig. 2e , supplementary fig. 3a and d for 90th , median , and 75th percentiles , respectively ) .
the 75th and 90th percentile tail intensities ( ti , a measure of the relative fraction of dna , see methods ) were also significantly greater in ragworms exposed to 8 filters l - 1 than to ragworms exposed to 0.5 and 4 filters l - 1 ( kruskal wallis , p = 0.04 and p = 0.01 , respectively ; supplementary fig. 4a and d for 75th and 90th percentiles , respectively ) .
following 96 h and 28 d exposures to filter microfibres in sediment , there was no significant dna damage ( see fig. 2f , supplemetary fig. 3 and 4 b and e ; and supplementary fig. 2d and 3 and 4 c and f , for 96 h and 28 d , respectively ) .
discussion this is the first study to assess the impacts of smoked cigarette filter ( from here on referred to as filters ) debris on a marine invertebrate .
we found that exposure to leached filter toxicants in seawater at a concentration of >= 2 filters l - 1 ( 172 mug l - 1 nicotine ) significantly inhibited burrowing behaviour in a marine worm , whilst greater concentrations led to reduced growth rates and increased dna damage. of the few studies that have assessed the impacts of filter toxicants on aquatic species , water fleas and juvenile fish exhibited greater sensitivity than ragworms did in the present study1415 .
further investigation is therefore required to determine the impacts of filters on other biotic components of coastal and marine ecosystems .
ragworms accumulated considerably less nicotine - an established biomarker of exposure to the toxicants associated with smoking - following sediment exposure to filter microfibres than following exposure to filter toxicants in seawater .
notably , the nicotine dose delivered by just one filter l - 1 via seawater is around 98 times that delivered to a human via smoking ( table 1 ) .
since ragworms were not fed during exposure to filter toxicants in seawater , uptake is anticipated to primarily occur via the epidermis ( fig. 1a ) .
nicotine is unionized and bioavailable under alkaline conditions16 .
the alkalinity of the seawater in this study ( ph 8.06 mean +/ - 0.007 s.e.m. ) indicates over 70 % of nicotine was bioavailable , allowing for rapid systemic circulation16 .
sediment exposure to filter microfibres and associated toxicants occurs predominantly via indiscriminate surface - deposit feeding .
post - ingestion , up to 70 % of nicotine is metabolised before entering systemic circulation13 ( fig. 1b ) .
the ph of the sediment measured during low tide ( 7.5 mean +/ - 0.01 s.e.m. , n = 12 ) suggests that over 90 % of the nicotine is bioavailable in sediment exposures16 .
however , the moderately acidic gut conditions of ragworms could counter this17 .
these factors may explain the low concentration of nicotine detected in ragworms following sediment exposures .
additionally , ragworms are unlikely to encounter the entire sediment volume , thus contacting only a fraction of the contaminant .
the worms' mucus - lined burrow may also act as a physical barrier , limiting encounter rates with nicotine ( fig. 1b ) .
following 96 h exposure to filter toxicants in seawater , the nicotine : cotinine ratio of ragworm tissue dramatically increased with increasing filter concentration , suggesting metabolism becomes impaired .
nicotine metabolism is important in reducing toxicity : cotinine has a similar mechanism of action to nicotine , but binds to neuronal acetylcholine receptors with lower potency18 .
if ingested , there is potential for microplastic and bioplastic debris to transfer adhered pollutants , which can accumulate on their surface up to several orders of magnitude greater than the surrounding water column1920 .
whilst sediment exposure to filter microfibres limited nicotine bioaccumulation , other types of particulate debris have been shown to transport chemical contaminants to invertebrates : microscopic polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) transferred adhered triclosan and nonylphenol to the gut tissue of sediment - dwelling lugworms , at levels which caused biological harm21 .
moreover , simulated gut conditions elicited greater desorption rates of chemical contaminants from microscopic polyethylene and pvc than seawater22 .
these studies employed higher concentrations of particles than the current study .
using the biomarker nicotine , we have shown that filters can act as a vector for the transport and introduction of associated toxicants to seawater through leaching .
this may pose an ecological risk to species which could encounter and bioaccumulate these toxicants from the surrounding seawater .
however , the ingestion of filter microfibers within sediment by benthic species as a route of exposure to associated toxicants is considered a lower threat .
we show that exposure to filter toxicants in seawater has a significant negative effect on the rgr of ragworms .
similarly , the weight of earthworms was reduced by up to 40 % following exposure to the neurotoxic insecticide imidacloprid , which is chemically similar to nicotine2324 .
the authors postulated this was due to decreased feeding , reduced assimilation efficiency , or the up - regulation of an energetically costly detoxification mechanism .
similar modes of toxicity could have also occurred in the present study .
no effect on the rgrs of ragworms was observed following 96 h and 28 d sediment exposures to filter microfibres .
the low nutritional value of the cellulose acetate microfibres may be anticipated to reduce rgr .
female rats showed a 14 % reduction in growth following prolonged dietary exposure to high doses of cellulose acetate , linked to a nutritional reduction in the feed25 .
the polychaete worm arenicola marina suffered significant reductions in energy reserves following exposure to >= 1 % microscopic pvc by weight26 .
this was likely in - part due to a reduction in the nutritional quality of material consumed .
the current study employed lower concentrations of microplastics , resulting in a higher proportion of nutritious substrate .
we consider the chemical toxicity of leached nicotine and associated toxicants from filters to seawater to be of greater concern than the ingestion of low - nutritive filter microfibers for impacting growth rate .
exposure to filter toxicants in seawater at a concentration of >= 2 filters l - 1 significantly affected burrowing activity in ragworms .
the insecticide imidacloprid impaired burrowing behaviour in earthworms ; burrows were smaller in area and shallower than control groups following a 6 day exposure27 .
nicotine is neurotoxic , affecting the central and autonomic nervous system and neuromuscular junctions by agonistically binding to the nicotinic acetyl cholinergic receptors ( nachrs ) 1328 .
this opens ion channels , causing an influx of sodium or calcium ions , increasing the release of neurotransmitters .
prolonged stimulation of nachrs can lead to desensitization , impairing neurological function13 .
this may explain the inhibited burrowing capacity of ragworms in the current study .
the burrowing behaviour of worms is central to their role as ecosystem engineers , reworking and aerating sediment to allow other organisms to thrive11 .
nicotine exposure via filter debris presents a potential risk to ecosystem health through its detrimental effects on the burrowing behaviour of worms ; this is deserving of further assessment to determine the extent of the risk to the benthic community .
as sediment exposure to filter microfibres limited nicotine bioaccumulation , burrowing activity was minimally affected .
filter microfibres within sediment as a vector for nicotine are therefore anticipated to be less neurologically hazardous than filter toxicants in seawater .
an average increase in dna damage of 2 - to 3 - fold from control to treatment is considered biologically relevant29 .
a fold increase > 2 from control to treatment was observed in the median , 75th , and 90th tm percentiles ( fig. 2e , and supplementary fig. 3a and d , for median , 75th , and 90th percentiles , respectively ) and in 75th and 90th ti percentiles ( supplementary fig. 4a and d , respectively ) of ragworms exposed to filter toxicants in seawater .
thus , filter toxicants in seawater at a concentration of 8 filters l - 1 ( 694 ng ml - 1 ) caused biologically relevant dna damage , likely due to oxidative stress30 .
however , previous studies have highlighted a protective effect of nicotine on dna damage at low concentrations through radical scavenging31 .
ragworms exposed to filter toxicants in seawater at concentrations up to 4 filters l - 1 ( 235.5 ng ml - 1 ) exhibited significantly lower levels of dna damage than those exposed to 8 filters l - 1 .
this indicates that ragworms experienced the protective effect of low nicotine dosage .
at lower nicotine doses , the neurotoxicity of nicotine may be of greater concern than potential dna damaging effects .
in conclusion , filter toxicants in seawater caused adverse dose - dependent effects on behaviour and high concentrations of filter toxicants effected growth in ragworms , which were linked to nicotine bioconcentration .
the concentration of nicotine in the aquatic environment is variable ; up to 32 mug l - 1 in effluent and 11,400 mug l - 1 in urban run - off have been reported3233 .
it was recently estimated that one smoked cigarette filter could contaminate 1000 l of water at a concentration exceeding the predicted no effect concentration ( 24 mug l - 1 ) 33 .
reported urban run - off concentrations are over 60 times greater than the effective concentration of nicotine in the current study (>= 172 mug l - 1 / 2 filters l - 1 ) .
therefore aquatic species in proximity to urbanised areas are at risk of nicotine exposure via run - off contaminated with smoked cigarette filters and their leachates .
in comparison , sediment exposure to filter microfibres - an anticipated route of exposure for ragworms in the marine environment - limits the bioaccumulation and toxicity of nicotine .
up to 3.5 cigarette filters m - 2 has been reported on beaches34 .
particulate smoked cigarette filter debris is therefore predicted to be of lower risk than leachates .
however , it is unknown how the aging of filters and their microfibres would affect nicotine bioaccumulation and toxicity .
the quantification of filters in coastal environments as well as the role of aging on filter toxicity are areas deserving of further research .
the protection , conservation and restoration of marine ecosystems increasingly rely on international legislation to curb anthropogenic impacts .
recently , statutory frameworks such as the european union marine strategy framework directive ( msfd ) have for the first time stipulated that the properties and quantities of marine litter , including microplastics , should not cause harm to the marine environment ( descriptor 10 , msfd , 2008 / 56 / ec ) .
quantitative toxicological data is essential for supporting the implementation of such legislation ; our results provide a first step towards setting guidance limits to curb smoking - related bioplastic debris .
we encourage further research into the role of environmental and physiological ph , and different exposure pathways when considering the impacts of filter toxicants and bioplastic microfibers on biotic components of marine ecosystems .
research into the impacts of smoked cigarette filters on marine life is crucial for consolidating the evidence base for remedial policy4 .

exposures and biological endpoints animal husbandry the ragworm hediste diversicolor was hand collected from the exe estuary , devon , uk ( 50degrees66 " 76 n , - 3degrees44 " 40w ) between february to april 2014 .
stock worms were maintained collectively in 4 cm of natural sediment with overlying artificial seawater ( asw , salinity of 22 ) in a temperature - controlled room ( 12 degreesc , 12 h light : 12 h dark ) .
ragworms were acclimated for at least 1 week .
water changes were performed on alternate days .
in all exposures , only healthy , complete ragworms were used .
exposure to smoked cigarette filter toxicants in sediment to establish whether the toxicants associated with filters are harmful to ragworms , an initial aqueous exposure was performed following14 and15 .
to produce increasing doses of leachates based on a filter l - 1 concentration , a leachate stock was produced , also forming the highest concentration ( 8 filters l - 1 ) .
smoked filters were placed in artificial seawater ( salinity of 22 ) on an orbital shaker in a temperature - controlled room for 24 h. the leachates were then vacuum - filtered through whatman cellulose filter paper ( grade 1 ) to remove any particulates due to cigarette filter degradation .
the remaining test concentrations were made by performing 0.5x dilution series with the filtered leachate and artificial seawater , achieving final concentrations of 8 , 4 , 2 , 1 and 0.5 cigarette filters l - 1 .
subsamples of each stock concentration were kept at - 80 degreesc for chemical analysis .
three hundred ml aliquots of leachates were added to 400 ml glass beakers ( acid - washed , 13 % hno3 ) immediately before the addition of ragworms .
beakers were randomly allocated a position in a temperature - controlled room ( 12 degreesc ) .
each beaker contained a length of silicon tubing , providing refuge .
beakers were gently aerated and covered to minimise evaporation .
ragworms were weighed and individually transferred to a beaker ( n = 6 per treatment group ) .
observations were made daily .
following 48 h , a water change was performed using fresh leachate from which subsamples were again taken for chemical analysis .
water parameters ( salinity , ph , dissolved oxygen ) were monitored throughout the exposure period .
after 96 h , ragworms were removed from exposure .
exposure to smoked cigarette filter microfibres in sediment to determine whether particulate debris from filters can transfer toxicants at levels capable of causing harm , the impacts of filter microfibers on ragworms were assessed .
filters free of outer paper and excess tobacco were ground under liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar until a fine powder formed .
subsamples were suspended in deionised water and observed under a microscope fitted with a camera for size analysis .
individual microfibres were randomly sized using image analysis software .
microfibers ( mean length 120.6 +/ - 5.1 mum s.e.m. , median length 96.5 mum , supplementary fig. 1 ) were added to sediment in bulk by weights equivalent to the concentrations above ( number of filters l - 1 ) .
the sediment was manually homogenised .
subsamples of each sediment stock concentration were kept at - 80 degreesc for chemical analysis .
forty eight hours prior to exposures , 225 ml of test sediment was added to 400 ml acid - washed , glass beakers ( 4 cm depth ) .
beakers were randomly allocated a position in a temperature - controlled room ( 12 degreesc ) , covered and left to acclimate overnight .
twenty four hours prior to exposures , 150 ml of artificial seawater ( salinity of 22 ) was poured into beakers over a clean , stainless steel spoon .
gentle aeration was provided and beakers were left covered .
ragworms were weighed and individually transferred to a beaker ( n = 6 per treatment group ) .
observations were made daily and water parameters were monitored throughout the exposure period .
two exposures were conducted , lasting 96 h and 28 d. during the 96 h exposure , a water change was performed after 48 h using fresh asw .
after 96 h , ragworms were removed from the exposure .
during the 28 d exposure , water changes were performed every 72 h. ragworms were not fed during this time as it was assumed they were surface - deposit - feeding on the test sediment .
after 28 days , ragworms were removed from exposure .
following endpoint measurements , ragworms were individually maintained in seawater ( salinity of 22 ) to void gut content in preparation for chemical analyses .
after approximately 10 h , ragworms were snap - frozen and stored at - 80 degreesc until use .
relative growth rate in addition to pre - exposure wet weights , post - exposure weights were also recorded .
following sediment exposure , any external sediment was carefully rinsed from ragworms .
excess seawater was gently absorbed using a paper towel and ragworms were weighed to 0.01 g. burrowing activity individuals were transferred to 400 ml glass beakers containing 225 ml wet control sediment ( corresponding to approximately 4 cm depth ) .
their burrowing time into clean sediment - from the moment their anterior end touched the sediment to being completely burrowed - was recorded within a 1 h observation period .
the burrowing time of ragworms which did not burrow during this time was considered as 60 min .
comet assay dna damage - measured as single - strand breaks in individual cells ( comet assay ) - was quantified to assess potential carcinogenic and pro - oxidative effects , anticipated due to the constituent toxicants of smoked cigarettes .
the comet assay quantifies dna damage as tail intensity ( ti ) and tail moment ( tm ) for individual cells .
ti indicates the relative fraction of damaged dna .
tm is the product of ti and tail length ( the migratory distance of broken dna fragments from the nucleus of the cell ) , providing a descriptive assessment of dna damage35 .
ragworms were recovered from the burrowing assay and carefully rinsed .
a sample of coelomic fluid was withdrawn with a 1 ml syringe containing chilled pbs at a 1:1 ratio , fitted with a 23 gauge needle .
samples were taken from the posterior region , taking care to avoid the gut , and stored on ice until use .
one hundred mul of sample was used per individual .
coelomic fluid was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 3 min and the supernatant was discarded .
the cell concentrate was then suspended in 1 % low melting point agarose ( 37 degreesc ) and two aliquots were dropped onto a slide pre - coated with 1 % normal melting point agarose .
coverslips were placed on top of the sample and slides were left for 10 min at 4 degreesc .
once the gel was set , coverslips were carefully removed and the comet assay was conducted , following36 , modifying for alkaline conditions .
slides were placed in lysis solution for 1 hour , followed by 40 min denaturation in electrophoresis buffer ( ph 13 ) and then electrophoresis for 30 min ( 25 v , 300 ma ) .
the slides were then gently washed in neutralising buffer .
100 cells per slide ( 50 per gel ) were scored within 48 h using sybr safe staining and a fluorescent microscope ( 420 - 490 nm excitation filter and 520 nm emission filter ) equipped with kinetic comet software .
chemical analysis nicotine and its metabolite cotinine were used as biomarkers of exposure to the toxicants associated with filters .
frozen ragworm tissue was thoroughly homogenised under liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar .
for each exposure and concentration sub - aliquots of homogenised tissue from each individual were pooled .
chromatography and detection ( ms / ms ) parameters analysis was carried out on an acquity upc2 system with a quattro premier xe mass spectrometer ( msms ) as detector ( both from waters corp , milford usa ) .
see supplementary table 1 for details .
sample preparation water samples : five hundred mul samples of aqueous exposure media ( water ) were spiked with internal standard solution ( 25 mul of a solution containing 500 ng / ml nicotine - d4 and cotinine - d3 ) and then adjusted to ph 10 with ammonia .
liquid - liquid extraction was performed with 1 ml ethyl acetate .
the upper ( ethyl acetate ) phase was removed and analysed .
sediment samples : sub - samples ( 0.5 g ) were weighed into 10 ml glass test - tubes and spiked with internal standard solution ( 100 mul of a solution containing 500 ng / ml nicotine - d4 and cotinine - d3 ) together with 3 ml water ( 2 % ammonium hydroxide ) and 4 ml acetonitrile .
samples were then extracted and cleaned according to aoac method 2007.01 for pesticide residues in foods by acetonitrile extraction and partitioning with magnesium sulphate ( reference : available online at http :// www.eoma.aoac.org / methods / info.asp ? id = 48938 ) .
ragworm samples : fifty milligram ragworm samples were weighed into 2 ml tubes and spiked with internal standard solution ( 10 mul of a solution containing 500 ng / ml nicotine - d4 and cotinine - d3 ) together with 300 mul water ( 2 % ammonium hydroxide ) and 400 mul acetonitrile .
samples were then extracted and cleaned according to aoac method 2007.01 for pesticide residues in foods by acetonitrile extraction and partitioning with magnesium sulphate ( reference : available online at http :// www.eoma.aoac.org / methods / info.asp ? id = 48938 ) .
statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed in r37 .
to ensure correct specification of the models used ( analysis of variance ) , the distribution of residuals was monitored using the shapiro wilks test for normality and levene 's test for homogeneity of variance .
where data did not conform to model assumptions , a log10 ( x + 1 ) transformation was performed .
if this did not increase suitability , an equivalent non - parametric test was performed .
any change in the weight of ragworms during exposures was assessed using the method of38 .
first , relative growth rate ( rgr ) was calculated as in equation 1 : where fw = final weight and iw = initial weight .
the effect of treatment on rgr was then analysed using a one - way anova ( n = 6 ) .
any change in burrowing time due to exposure was determined using a one - way anova or kruskal wallis test where appropriate ( n = 6 ) .
a change in tail intensity ( ti ) and tail moment ( tm ) was analysed using the methods of293940 , whereby the statistical analysis is performed by animal ( as opposed to by gel or by cell ) using a summary statistic calculated by equation 2 : where x is substituted for the median , 75th , or 90th percentile based on recommendations by2940 .
the effect of treatment on ti and tm was then analysed using a one - way anova or kruskal wallis test ( n = 6 ) .
where a kruskal wallis was applied and a significant p - value obtained , post - hoc wilcoxon rank sum tests were used on pairwise permutations .
post - hoc analysis following a one - way anova was conducted using a tukey hsd test .
the lowest concentration which elicited a significantly different response compared to the control was identified as the lowest observed effect concentration ( loec ) , whilst the highest concentration which did not cause a significantly different response compared to the control was identified as the no observed effect concentration ( noec ) .
bioaccumulation bioconcentration factors ( bcfaqu and bcf sed ) - the level of accumulation of a chemical in an organism from seawater and sediment , respectively - were calculated .
this was quantified using the following calculation ( equation 3 ) : where cb = biota concentration and cm = medium ( leachate or sediment ) concentration .

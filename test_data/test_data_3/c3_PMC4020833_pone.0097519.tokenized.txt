the colony stimulating factor - 1 receptor ( csf - 1r ) and the stem cell factor receptor kit , type iii receptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) , are important mediators of signal transduction .
the normal functions of these receptors can be compromised by gain - of - function mutations associated with different physiopatological impacts .
whereas kit d816v / h mutation is a well - characterized oncogenic event and principal cause of systemic mastocytosis , the homologous csf - 1r d802v has not been identified in human cancers .
the kit d816v oncogenic mutation triggers resistance to the rtk inhibitor imatinib used as first line treatment against chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors .
csf - 1r is also sensitive to imatinib and this sensitivity is altered by mutation d802v .
previous in silico characterization of the d816v mutation in kit evidenced that the mutation caused a structure reorganization of the juxtamembrane region ( jmr ) and facilitated its departure from the kinase domain ( kd ) .
in this study , we showed that the equivalent csf - 1r d802v mutation does not promote such structural effects on the jmr despite of a reduction on some key h - bonds interactions controlling the jmr binding to the kd. in addition , this mutation disrupts the allosteric communication between two essential regulatory fragments of the receptors , the jmr and the a - loop .
nevertheless , the mutation - induced shift towards an active conformation observed in kit d816v is not observed in csf - 1r d802v .
the distinct impact of equivalent mutation in two homologous rtks could be associated with the sequence difference between both receptors in the native form , particularly in the jmr region .
a local mutation - induced perturbation on the a - loop structure observed in both receptors indicates the stabilization of an inactive non - inhibited form , which imatinib cannot bind .

introduction receptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) are cell - surface transmembrane receptors that possess a tightly regulated tyrosine kinase ( tk ) activity within their cytoplasmic domain [ 1 ] .
they act as sensors for extracellular ligands , the binding of which triggers receptor dimerization and activation of the kinase function , leading to the recruitment , phosphorylation and activation of multiple downstream signaling proteins , which ultimately govern the physiology of cells [ 2 ] .
based on their overall architecture and kinase domain ( kd ) sequence , rtks have been grouped into 20 subfamilies [ 3 ] .
the type iii rtk subfamily includes the stem cell factor ( scf ) receptor kit , the macrophage colony - stimulating factor - 1 ( csf - 1 ) receptor csf - 1r ( or fms ) , the platelet - derived growth factor alpha and beta ( pdgfr - alpha and pdgfr - beta ) and the fms - like tyrosine kinase 3 ( flt3 ) [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
as compared to kit , whose activating mutations are hallmarks of systemic mastocytosis [ 5 ] , and gastro - intestinal stromal tumors ( gists ) [ 6 ] , or to flt3 , whose activating mutations are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemias ( aml ) [ 7 ] , activating mutations in csf - 1r gene have been rarely detected in human tumors [ 8 ] .
nevertheless , csf - 1r is a therapeutic target in oncology , either to inhibit a paracrine loop that promotes tumor growth [ 9 ] or to re - educate tumor associated macrophages ( tams ) within tumor microenvironment [ 10 ] .
the receptor could be targeted also to prevent osteopenia in neurofibromatosis type - 1 [ 11 ] , whereas the diverse constitutive heterozygous mutations in csf - 1r that are responsible for an autosomal dominant neurological disorder called hdls ( hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids ) are loss of function mutations [ 12 ] .
the type iii rtks have a common architecture that includes extracellular immunoglobin ( ig ) - like domains to which polypeptide ligands bind , a single - pass transmembrane helix , an autoinhibitory juxtamembrane region ( jmr ) and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase ( tk ) domain including a kinase insert domain ( kid ) [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] of a variable length (~ 60 - 100 residues ) , and a carboxy - terminal tail [ 15 ] - [ 17 ] ( fig. s1 ) .
the tk domain has a bi - lobar structure , with an atp - binding cleft located between the n - and c - terminal lobes .
the n - lobe is composed of twisted five - stranded anti - parallel beta - sheet adjacent to an alpha - helix ( calpha - helix ) and the c - lobe shows predominantly alpha - helical structure ( fig. 1 ) .
the c - lobe contains an activation loop ( a - loop ) that begins with the highly conserved ' dfg ' motif composed of three amino acids - aspartic acid ( d ) , phenylalanine ( f ) , and glycine ( g ) .

structure of csf - 1r cytoplasmic region .
crystallographic structures of the native receptor ( a ) in the inactive ( 2ogv [ 22 ]) and ( b ) the active forms ( 3lcd [ 85 ] are presented as cartoon .
the different domains of csf - 1r and key structural fragments are highlighted in color .
the n - terminal proximal lobe ( n - lobe ) is in blue , the c - terminal distal lobe ( c - lobe ) is in green , the calpha - helix is in cyan , the activation loop ( a - loop ) is in red , the juxtamembrane region ( jmr ) is in orange .
the dfg motif ( asp796 , phe797 , gly798 ) and position of d802v mutation ( insert ) are represented in sticks. bottom .
the jmr sequence in rtks of iii family .
the sequence alignment shows a poor sequence conversation of the jmr among the receptors tk of type iii .
identical residues and similar residues are shown in red and in green , respectively .
the three strongly conserved tyrosine residues are contoured .
except csf - 1r , the other rtks from iii family possess a second functional phosphotyrosine ( green , contoured ) in jm - switch .
in the absence of ligand , the receptors are in dynamic equilibrium between two states : the inactive autoinhibited state that is highly dominant , and the active state [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
two crucial kinase regulatory segments , the a - loop and the jmr , undergo extensive conformational rearrangements during the activation / deactivation processes ( fig. 1 ) .
in the inactive auto - inhibited state of the receptor , the a - loop is adjacent to the active site and the dfg motif at its n - extremity adopts an " out " conformation , i.e. , its phenylalanine is flipped into the atp - binding site , thus preventing atp and mg2 + co - factor binding [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
this conformation is stabilized by the jmr that inserts itself directly into the kinase active site and impairs the arrangement of the a - loop in its active conformation .
the single tyrosine in the a - loop binds to the catalytic loop as a pseudo - substrate and contributes to keep the receptor in its inactive form .
upon activation , the jmr moves from its auto - inhibitory position to a completely solvent - exposed emplacement .
this is followed by a conformational swap of the a - loop from its inactive packed arrangement to an active extended conformation .
such large - scale conformational transition , together with a switch of the dfg motif to an " in " conformation allows atp entrance and binding in the catalytic site .
analysis of the crystallographic structures of kit , csf - 1r and flt3 in their inactive state [ 20 ] - [ 22 ] suggested a particular mechanism of auto - inhibition based on extensive interactions of the jmr with the tk domain .
the jmr is composed of three fragments : jm - binder ( jm - b ) , buried into the tk domain making direct contacts with the calpha - helix , the catalytic ( c - ) loop and the a - loop ; jm - switch ( jm - s ) that adopts a hairpin - like conformation positioned apart from the c - lobe and contains the tyrosine residues responsible for the conformational switch ; and jm - zipper ( jm - z ) , packed along the solvent - exposed face of the calpha - helix ( fig. 1 ) .
together , the jm - b and the jm - z block the calpha - helix , which also regulates the catalytic activity of the kinases [ 23 ] , and prevent the a - loop from adopting an active conformation , restricting the inter - lobe plasticity .
mutational hotspot regions in type iii rtks are mainly located in the jmr and the a - loop , although mutations have also been found in the extracellular and in the transmembrane regions [ 17 ] .
gain - of - function point mutations induce either tyrosine kinase constitutive ( i. e. , ligand - independent ) activation and / or resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors .
particularly , mutation of an aspartic residue in the a - loop , namely d835 ( v / y / h / v / e / n ) in flt3 , d816 ( v / h / n / y / e / i ) in kit , and d842v in pdgfralpha , is a typical example of mutation that confers a proliferative signal .
the kit d816v oncogenic mutation in addition triggers resistance to the rtk inhibitor imatinib [ 6 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
csf - 1r is also sensitive to imatinib and this sensitivity is altered by d802v mutation [ 26 ] .
these mutations reverse the conformational equilibrium of the kinase toward the active form , which compromises the efficacy of the inhibitors targeting inactivated form of the receptor [ 27 ] .
the physiological role of d802v mutation is not well - understood , the previous studies have shown that d802v mutation constitutively activates the receptor , transforming the haemopoietic cell line fdc - p1 yet prevented rat - 2 fibroblast transformation , apparently due to a higher rate of receptor degradation [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
considering the differential physiological effects induced by the equivalent mutation in the two receptors , a dissimilar role of the equivalent residue , d802 in csf - 1r and d816 in kit , in the activation mechanisms may be suggested .
csf - 1r and kit have considerable sequence identity ( 68 %) and their auto - inhibited states display great structural similarities ( rmsd is 1.14 a ) [ 22 ] .
unlike the other type iii rtk family members , the jm - s region of csf - 1r contains a unique conserved tyrosine ( y561 ) [ 30 ] ( fig. 1 ) , which is responsible for the receptor activation .
we have reported that kit d816v mutation , positioned in the a - loop , induced a long - range structural reorganization of the jmr , followed by its release from the kd in the absence of extracellular ligand binding [ 31 ] .
we have also evidenced that a communication route established between the distant a - loop and jmr in the native protein was disrupted in kit d816v mutant [ 32 ] .
in the present paper , we explore the impact of the equivalent mutation d802v on the structure , dynamics and stability of csf - 1r by all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , principal component analysis ( pca ) , normal modes analysis ( nma ) , binding free energy evaluation and inter - residue communication analysis .
the data produced for csf - 1r were carefully compared with those previously obtained for kit .
although d802v mutation in csf - 1r seems to have a more subtle impact on the receptor structure respectively to kit , it induces a loss of allosteric communication of the jm - b with the main regulatory fragments - the a - loop and the calpha - helix - similarly to kit .
nevertheless , a part of the jmr communication with the kd observed in the native receptor is preserved in csf - 1r mutant , and probably participates in controlling csf - 1r activation .
the mutation - induced disruption of a small 310 - helix in the a - loop and reorganization of the dfg motif conformation is consistent with the inactive non - autoinhibited conformation observed in both receptors .
the results of this study offer a plausible common mechanism , according to which the equivalent mutation may induce resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the inactive autoinhibited state of type iii rtks .
materials and methods bioinformatics and structure analysis secondary structure prediction the secondary structure prediction for the jmr residues was performed using six methods based on the protein primary sequence : gor4 [ 33 ] , an information theory - based method that uses probability parameters derived from empirical studies of crystallographic structures , taking into account not only the propensities of individual amino acids to form particular secondary structures , but also the conditional probability given that its immediate neighbors have already formed that structure .
jpred [ 34 ] uses the jnet [ 35 ] algorithm to make the prediction of the secondary structure and solvent accessibility by combining blast [ 36 ] , to search the protein sequence against sequences in the protein data bank ( pdb ) [ 37 ] and uniref90 [ 38 ] - in this case , only uniref90 database was used ; psi - blast [ 39 ] , to make an alignment ; hmmer [ 40 ] , to construct an hidden markov model profile based on the alignment ; and a position - specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) [ 41 ] , output from psi - blast .
sopma [ 42 ] makes the prediction of the secondary structure based on the homolog method of levin [ 43 ] .
the algorithm uses a database of 126 chains of non - homologous proteins to search against the user sequence .
scratch [ 44 ] combines machine learning methods , evolutionary information in the form of profiles , fragment libraries extracted from the pdb and energy functions to predict protein structural features and also tertiary structures , see the article for further information of the specific methods used by each predictor .
netsurfp [ 45 ] consists of two neural network ensembles used to predict the secondary structure and the relative surface accessibility of an amino acid .
psipred [ 46 ] incorporates two feed - forward neural networks which perform an analysis on output obtained from psi - blast .
finally , stride , a knowledge - based algorithm that assigns the secondary structure from atomic coordinates based on the combined use of hydrogen bond energy and statistically derived backbone torsional angle information [ 47 ] was used to predict the secondary structure of jmr in csf - 1r using the crystallographic structure ( 2ogv ) [ 22 ] as input .
vmd [ 48 ] and pymol [ 49 ] were used for visualization and the analysis graphics were drawn using grace ( http :// plasma - gate.weizmann.ac.il / grace /) .
electrostatic potential surface electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated on the crystal structures of csf - 1r ( pdb code : 20gv ) and kit ( pdb code : 1t45 ) using apbs at pdb2pqr web - based server ( http :// www.poissonboltzmann.org / pdb2pqr / d / web - servers ) .
molecular dynamics simulations preparation of initial coordinate files .
the crystallographic structure of the wild - type ( wt ) auto - inhibited form of csf - 1r cytoplasmic region ( pdb id : 2ogv ) [ 22 ] was retrieved from the protein data bank [ 37 ] .
all crystallographic water molecules were removed .
modeller 9v8 [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] was used to add missing atoms at some residues ( 543 - 545 , 606 - 607 , 620 - 621 , 623 , 625 , 677 , 741 , 812 , 814 and 918 ) .
in silico substitution of asp ( d ) to val ( v ) at position 802 was performed by modeller , using the wt structure as template , making them comparable starting models .
generated models of the native csf - 1r and its mutant d802v were referred to as csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu respectively .
set up of the systems .
the setup of the systems ( csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu ) was performed using amber force field , parameter set 99sb [ 52 ] inside gromacs package , version 4.5 [ 53 ] .
the molecules were centered in a cubic box with a 1.5 nm distance to the faces , under periodic boundary conditions and solvated with explicit tip3p model water molecules [ 54 ] .
cl - counter ions were added when necessary to neutralize the overall charge ( 3 for csf - 1rwt and 4 for csf - 1rmu ) .
the minimization procedure consisted of 2 steps : steepest descent energy minimization ( em ) with the solute atoms restrained ; ( ii ) em with all atoms free .
the equilibration procedure was performed on the solvent , keeping the solute heavy atoms restrained for 500 ps at 310 k and a constant volume ( canonical nvt ensemble ) .
production of trajectories .
two production runs of 50 ns were carried out for both receptors , csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
the temperatures of solute ( protein ) and solvent ( water and ions ) were separately coupled to the velocity rescale thermostat [ 55 ] at 310 k with relaxation time of 0.1 ps. the pressure was maintained at 1 atm by isotropic coordinate scaling with relaxation time of 1 ps using berendsen thermostat [ 56 ] .
a time step of 2 fs was used to integrate the equations of motion based on the leap - frog algorithm [ 57 ] .
the lennard - jones interactions were shifted to a cut - off 1.4 nm , and the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method [ 58 ] was used to treat long - range electrostatic interactions .
the neighbor list for the electrostatic interactions was updated every 5 steps , together with the pair list .
all bonds were constrained using the p - lincs algorithm [ 59 ] .
the settle algorithm [ 60 ] was used to constrain the geometry of the water molecules .
coordinates files were recorded every 1 ps. analysis of the trajectories .
the trajectories for each pair of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations were analyzed with tools included in the gromacs package .
when concatenating the md simulations replicas , the first 5 ns of each replica trajectory needed to achieve relaxation were not considered .
analyses were performed on the resulting merged trajectory of 90 ns for each protein or based on the 45 ns individual replicas .
we have also produced a 60 ns concatenated trajectory from the last 30 ns from each replica to be further used for idss calculations with moneta [ 32 ] .
a convergence analysis was performed on the merged trajectories using an ensemble - based approach [ 61 ] .
the algorithm makes use of the global calpha atoms rmsd to discriminate representative md conformations .
the procedure for each trajectory can be described as follows : ( i ) a set of reference structures are identified , ( ii ) the md conformational ensemble was clustered into corresponding reference groups .
each reference structure was first picked up at random and associated with a bin of conformations distant by less than an arbitrary cutoff r. then the merged trajectory was split in four halves ( two halves for each replica ) and conformations from each half were grouped based on their rmsd from each reference structure .
a good convergence quality was assessed when each reference group was populated by conformations from the four halves of the trajectory at equivalent levels , meaning that every reference structure is equivalently represented in both replicas of the trajectory .
geometrical measurements .
two characteristic distances were monitored every 10 ps over the md simulations of each model : ( i ) the distance d1 between the centroid ( c ) of the jm - b region ( residues 543 - 552 , c1 ) and the c of the remaining residues in the n - lobe ( 582 - 664 , c1 ') ; ( ii ) the distance d2 between the c of the jm - s ( residues 553 - 564 , c2 ) and the c - lobe ( residues 671 - 922 , c2 ') .
the hydrogen ( h - ) bond analyses were done with the program g _ hbond available in gromacs .
time occupancy of h - bonds stabilizing the jmr and the a - loop was recorded every 100 ps of simulation for each model of csf - 1r .
h - bonds ( d *** h - a ) where defined with a dha angle cutoff of 120degrees and a d *** a distance cutoff of 3.5 a ( d and a are donor and acceptor atoms ) .
secondary structure prevalence .
the secondary structure profile was calculated using the program do _ dssp available in gromacs .
the program makes use of dssp [ 62 ] .
the calculation was performed over the merged 90 ns trajectories for both forms of the receptor .
energy analysis the free energy of jmr or its segments ( ligand , l ) binding to kd ( receptor , r ) defined as ( 1 ) was computed over the merged trajectories and on the individual md simulations , considering only the last 30 ns from each replica for both csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
free energies were evaluated using the molecular mechanism generalized born surface area ( mmgbsa ) method , implemented in amber 12 [ 63 ] - [ 66 ] .
this method combines the molecular mechanical energies with the continuum solvent approaches .
the molecular mechanical energies represent the internal energy ( covalent bonds , angles and dihedral angels contributions ) , and contribution of van der waals and electrostatic interactions .
the electrostatic contribution to the solvation free energy is calculated by generalized born ( gb ) methods .
the non - polar contribution to the solvation free energy is determined with solvent - accessible - surface - area - dependent terms .
estimates of conformational entropies are calculated with the normal mode module from amber .
normal modes analysis normal modes ( nm ) analysis was performed using the diagonalization in a mixed basis ( dimb ) method [ 67 ] of the vibran module of charmm 35b3 [ 68 ] , [ 69 ] on md conformations from ( i ) csf - 1rwt taken at 1 526 , 49 390 , 66 530 and 81 680 ps , spanning both replicas contained in the 90 - ns merged trajectory , and ( ii ) csf - 1rmu mutant taken at 5 510 , 23 530 , 40 670 and 84 680 ps. the selected md conformations were found to be the most representative of the trajectories , according to the convergence analysis .
the first hydration shell ( 5 a ) around the md conformations was kept to help prevent the solvent - exposed regions of the protein from collapsing during the minimization procedure [ 70 ] .
during initial steepest descent energy minimization of the system , mass - weighted harmonic constraints of 250 kcal / mol / a2 were applied to the starting structure and reduced by a factor of 2 every 1000 minimization steps until they fell below a threshold value of 5 kcal / mol / a2 .
the constraints were then removed and the system was minimized by conjugate gradient and adopted - basis newton - raphson steps until the rms energy gradient fell below 10 - 5 kcal / mol / a2 .
normal modes were computed by diagonalizing the mass - weighted hessian matrix of the energy - minimized conformations and the 96 non - zero lowest - frequency modes were analyzed .
the degree of collectivity of the jmr motions in a given mode l was calculated as [ 71 ] , [ 72 ] : ( 2 ) where n = 663 is the number of atoms belonging to jmr .
the quantity alphai is defined as : ( 3 ) where xi , yi and zi are the components of mode l showing the three degrees of freedom of atom i and such that . the degree of collectivity is comprised between 0 and 1 .
a value of 1 / n indicates that only one atom is involved in the motion while a value close to 1 indicates high collectivity .
the resultant displacement , i.e. the norm of the resultant displacement vector , of any fragment of the protein was calculated as : ( 4 ) over the ensemble m of the m atoms belonging to the fragment - 172 for jm - switch and 181 for jm - zipper .
principal component analysis a principal component analysis ( pca ) was applied to each model to identify the main eigenvectors ( 3n directions ) along which the majority of the collective motions are defined .
the calculations were performed on the backbone atoms positions recorded every ps along the trajectories for each 45 ns simulation replica .
the 100 first modes of each trajectory were extracted .
the calculation was performed using the g _ covar module of gromacs package .
the overlap between the first 10 modes of each trajectory was calculated using the g _ anaeig module of gromacs package .
briefly , the method consists in overlapping the subspace spanned by m orthogonal vectors w1 ,... , wm with a reference subspace spanned by n orthonormal vectors v1 , ... , vn and it can be quantified as follows : ( 5 ) the overlap will increase with increasing m and will be 1 when set v is a subspace of set w. analysis of intramolecular communication modular network representations of csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu were built and visualized with moneta [ 32 ] , using the most advanced version [ 73 ] .
the principle of the moneta approach consists in building a modular network representation of the protein , composed of clusters of residues representing independent dynamic segments ( idss ) and chains of residues representing communication pathways ( cps ) .
the representation is derived from the protein topology and the inter - residue dynamical correlations calculated on a conformational ensemble obtained by md simulations .
cps were generated based on the communication propensities [ 81 ] between all protein residues .
idss and cps in csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu were determined using a protocol described in details in our previous work [ 32 ] .
idss were identified from local feature analysis ( lfa ) [ 74 ] based on pca .
pca calculations were performed for both models of the receptor , on the calpha atoms covariance matrices calculated on the concatenated 60 ns trajectory merged from the two 50 ns md replicas , considering only the last 30 ns of each simulation. from the 3n eigenvalues associated with the 3n eigenvectors , the first 17 and 19 eigenvectors were sufficient to describe 80 % of the total calpha atomic fluctuations on csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu , respectively .
these vectors were used to apply the lfa formalism as described in [ 32 ] .
a threshold value pcut was arbitrary chosen by the program to keep 1.0 % of all lfa cross - correlations above it. the value was set to 0.035 for the wt and 0.038 for the d802v csf - 1r .
distance matrices consisting of the average of the smallest distance between each residue pairs were computed using the g _ mdmat module of gromacs package , v.4.5.6 .
two residues were considered neighbors if the average smallest distance between them was lower than a given threshold dcut of 3.6 a. since we have observed a slightly different dynamical behavior in the two md simulation replicas , we have computed the cps on the individual md simulations , considering the last 30 ns only , in order to distinguish between the communication pathways of csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
one replica of each form of receptor was retained for the illustrations .
the cps definition was based on the concept of communication propensity described elsewhere [ 32 ] .
the cps are grown ensuring that the adjacent residues are connected by non - covalent interactions and that every residue in the cp is connected to any other point by a shorter commute time ( ct ) .
non - bonded interactions were recorded along the md simulations using ligplot [ 75 ] .
two residues were considered as interacting when they formed at least one non - bonded interaction for 50 % of the simulation time .
to discriminate between large and short cts , a threshold ctcut was chosen so that highly connected residues communicate efficiently with about 10 % of the total number of residues in the protein [ 76 ] .
the threshold values were set to 0.1 for both models .
statistical analyses were performed with the r software [ 77 ] ; visualization of the structure / interaction / communication characteristics / results are performed with pymol [ 49 ] incorporated in moneta [ 73 ] .
results and discussion models of the native cytoplasmic region of csf - 1r ( csf - 1r543 - 922 ) and its mutant d802v ( referred to as csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu respectively ) were generated from the crystallographic structure of the wild - type ( wt ) receptor in an auto - inhibited inactive state ( 2ogv ) [ 22 ] .
a similar kitwt and kitmu abbreviation was used for cross - receptor comparisons .
differential effects of csf - 1r d802v and kit d816v homologous mutations on receptor tertiary structure molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the generated models ( two 50 - ns trajectories for each form ) were carried out to investigate and compare the structure and internal dynamics of the two proteins , csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
the global dynamical behavior of the proteins was explored by measuring the root mean square deviations ( rmsds ) of backbone atoms with respect to the initial frame plotted versus simulation time and showed separately for n - and c - lobes , the jmr and the a - loop regions ( fig. 2a ) .
the four trajectories of csf - 1r ( two replicas for csf - 1rwt and two for csf - 1rmu ) displayed comparable conformational drifts , with rmsd mean values in the range 0.12 - 0.30 nm indicating a tolerable stability of the simulated systems after a 5 ns relaxation interval .
however , the rmsd profile of the a - loop region showed high deviation after 17 ns for one csf - 1rmu replica , with rmsd values up to ~ 0.26 nm , which was not observed in the other trajectories .
we observed a similar behavior for the a - loop in kit md simulations [ 31 ] , although the deviations were significantly larger than in csf - 1r .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0097519.g002 figure 2 md simulations of the csf - 1r cytoplasmic domain in the inactive state .
two forms of receptor , the native ( csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu ( d802v ) were simulated twice during 50 ns .
( a ) the root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) values were calculated for backbone atoms from trajectories 1 and 2 of md simulations of csf - 1rwt ( black and blue ) and csf - 1r mu ( red and orange ) .
rmsds ( in nm ) plotted versus simulation time ( ns ) and showed separately for n - and c - lobes , jmr and a - loop regions .
( b ) the root mean square fluctuations ( rmsf ) computed on the backbone atoms over the total production simulation time of csf - 1rmu ( red ) were compared to those in csf - 1rwt ( black ) .
the rmsfs of the a - loop is zoomed in the insert .
the average conformations for csf - 1rwt ( c ) and csf - 1rmu ( d ) are presented as tubes .
the size of the tube is proportional to the by - residue atomic fluctuations computed on the backbone atoms .
the high fluctuation region found in proteins , are specified by red color and numerated from 1 to 10 in b - d. the size of numbers in d is proportional to rmsfs .
the root mean square fluctuation ( rmsf ) values , describing atomic fluctuations averaged over the protein residues , ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 nm , and were overall quantitatively comparable between csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu ( fig. 2b ) .
projection of rmsf values on the tridimensional structure of csf - 1r ( fig. 2c ) revealed that the most flexible residues formed clusters located in the jmr , encompassing the most buried jm - b fragment ( residues 543 - 545 ) and part of the jm - s ( residues 556 - 560 ) , the a - loop , the kid , and the loop that connects beta3 - strand ( residues 620 - 625 ) and calpha - helix in the n - lobe .
the d802v mutation noticeably enhanced rmsf fluctuations in these regions ( fig. 2d ) .
a zooming on the a - loop rmsf values indicated the perturbation on the atomic coordinates observed in one of the md simulations of csf - 1rmu ( fig. 2b , insert ) .
systematic analysis of the md conformations indicated that the structure of csf - 1r cytoplasmic region was globally conserved over the simulation time in csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu and shows in general a similarity between these two forms ( fig. 3a ) .
nevertheless , a detailed inspection of the secondary structures showed different folding of the a - loop in the two proteins .
the crystallographic data of the native receptor ( pdb id : 2ogv ) [ 22 ] show that residue d802 is located in a short bend between two small 310 - helices formed by residues 798 - 800 ( h1 ) and 803 - 805 ( h2 ) .
over the md simulations of csf - 1rwt the structure of h1 region was mainly folded as a 310 - helix while the h2 region secondary structure type alternated between 310 - helix ( 5 %) , bend ( 20 %) , turn ( 30 %) and coil ( 45 %) ( fig. 3b , on the right ) .
in csf - 1rmu , the only secondary structure element retained over the simulations is the 310 - helix h1 positioned prior the d802v mutation site .
the second 310 - helix , h2 , which follows the mutated site , is disappeared , and the residues 803 - 805 adopt a turn conformation as was evidenced for most of the simulation time .

snapshots taken from the two md replicas at 15 , 25 , 35 and 50 ns for csf - 1rwt ( top ) and csf - 1rmu ( bottom ) were superimposed by pair .
superposed conformations were selected by rmsds clustering .

each secondary structure type is shown with lines of different colors : 310 helices ( in cyan ) , parallel beta - sheet ( in red ) , turn ( in orange ) , bend ( in blue ) and bridge ( green ) .
coiled structure is sown by dashed lines .
the d802v position is indicated as a red circle .
such disappearing of the well - ordered structural element , previously observed in kitwt , and the increased atomic fluctuations in the a - loop , results from the replacement of the negative capping aspartate by a hydrophobic valine , i.e. , the absence of the negatively charged side chain of aspartate disrupted a positive dipole moment formed by the small 310 - helix adjacent to the mutation , which is supposed to destabilize the inactive structure of the a - loop [ 78 ] .
a similar local structural effect was observed experimentally in kitd816h ( 3g0f ) [ 27 ] and predicted by in silico studies in kitd816v [ 31 ] and in kitd816h / n / y mutants ( our data submitted to publishing ) .
the disappearance of the h2 310 - helix changed the local h - bond network in the a - loop of csf - 1rmu ( data not shown ) as it was observed in kitmu .
whereas kit d816v / h / n / y mutations led systematically to a global structural reorganization of the jmr which adopts a well - shaped anti - parallel beta - sheet structure translated in the axial position respectively to the kd [ 31 ] , such a long - range effect , surprisingly , was not observed in csf - 1rmu .
the jmr structure and dynamics were strikingly similar in csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
the quantitative analysis of the secondary structure pattern over the md simulations revealed a retained secondary structure of the jmr in csf - 1rmu compared to csf - 1rwt ( fig. 3b ) .
moreover , despite a topical increase of the jm - b fluctuations in csf - 1rmu , the jmr position was rigorously maintained relative to the kd ( fig. 3a ) .
on the contrary to kitwt , the jmr of csf - 1rwt is already folded as a well - shaped anti - parallel beta - sheet , as evidenced in the crystallographic structure [ 22 ] .
altogether , kit d816v and the homologous csf - 1r d802v similarly affect the receptor structure alone at the proximity of the mutated residue , while the jmr structure is only altered in kit mutant .
such a difference , which can be related to the distinct sequence of these regions in the two receptors , may have functional consequences .
to explore the secondary structure profile of csf - 1r jmr ( residues 538 - 580 ) , we used six sequence - based secondary structure prediction methods and one structure knowledge - based method .
predictions indicated a relatively high probability of the polypeptide organization in well - folded structural elements , particularly beta - strands in the segments 551 - 555 and 563 - 564 linked by a random coil including 4 residues , probably stabilized as a turn ( fig. s2 ) .
this secondary structure prediction matches well with the jmr structure of the native receptor ( csf - 1rwt ) observed by x - ray crystallography and obtained by md simulations of csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
this observation prompts to hypothesize that either the jmr structure in csf - 1r does not depend on the kd - a behavior quite different from the allosterically regulated jmr folding in kit , - or d802 in csf - 1r and d816 in kit do not play a similar role in the activation mechanisms .
dynamic behavior of receptors to address the csf - 1r structural properties related to its functions , particularly to distinguish the receptor features associated to the activation mechanisms , we characterized the dynamical behavior of both proteins , csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
we used the large - amplitude collective motions that describe the protein functional dynamics [ 79 ] .
among these motions , the most probable ones , also known as the softest modes , are usually highly collective , i.e. , they drive the cooperative motions of entire domains / subunits .
here , we used the principal component analysis ( pca ) ( i ) to clarify the mutation effects in the context of collective motions between functional csf - 1r fragments in the cytoplasmic region , ( ii ) to compare the impact of mutation on dynamical features of csf - 1r and kit , and ( iii ) to connect motions with communications between spatially distant regulatory fragments , namely a - loop and jmr .
the most relevant movements of csf - 1r fragments were identified by emphasizing the amplitudes ( eigenvalues ) and directions ( eigenvectors ) of the protein motions dominating the residue pair covariance matrix calculated from the md ensemble .
the calculation was done for the individual md simulation trajectories of each model and the best overlap between csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu was used for illustration .
among the first 10 eigenvectors , which contribute the most to the total atomic fluctuations , the first two modes of csf - 1rmu display eigenvalues twice as big as those of csf - 1rwt ( fig. 4a ) .
the overlap between the eigenvectors showed a good agreement between csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu for modes 2 and 3 ( fig. 4b ) .
in both csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu , the 2nd mode was associated mainly with the displacement of the a - loop , the loop linking beta3 - strand and calpha - helix and the c - terminus .
mode 3 showed the concerted movements of the loops connecting the beta - sheet in the n - lobe and also movements in the proximity of the c - terminus , while we did not observed any movement in the kd correlated to the jmr motions in both receptors .
noticeably the observed jms motions in mode 3 depict " back - and - forward " movements in both models , which are not characteristic of jmr departure ( fig. 4c - d ) .

jmr is in blue , a - loop is in violet and the rest of protein is in grey .
normal modes analyses ( nma ) were carried out to further characterize the collective movements related to the jmr .
the choice of the initial csf - 1r conformations was based on a convergence analysis performed on the merged trajectories [ 61 ] .
the stability of the systems was described in terms of representative md conformations .
briefly , a set of reference structures were picked up randomly among the md conformational ensemble of the trajectories and reference groups were composed of conformations from the two replicas of each trajectory .
a good convergence quality can be assessed when each reference structure is more or less equally represented in both replicas .
a lone reference structure is defined as a reference structure that is not represented in one - half of the trajectory ( one empty reference group ) .
to ensure the robustness of the method , we performed the analyses using five different random seeds for the reference structure picking up. for each form of the receptors , the fourth run containing the set of conformations that was better represented among the different replicas was chosen .
the results of this analysis are summarized in table s1 and fig. s3 .
the computed degrees of collectivity of jmr atomic motions , kjmr , ranged from 1 / n ( only one atom among n is involved in the motion ) to 1 ( highly collective ) .
the mean kjmr value for csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu of 0.44 and 0.42 respectively , indicating a low and statistically identical degree of collectivity in both proteins denoting the absence of independent motions associated with the jmr .
the modes correlated to movements located at the jmr clearly indicated a great similarity between csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
altogether , the nm analysis confirmed the absence of jmr displacement from the kd in the mutated protein , evidenced by the pca .
coupling between jmr and kd in receptors in order to probe a possible coupling of the jmr with the kinase domain ( kd ) , we first characterized the relative position of these two receptor 's portions using two geometrical parameters , d1 and d2 , describing the distance between the centroids defined on jm - b and n - lobe , and jm - s and c - lobe , respectively ( fig. 5a ) .
monitoring of these distances over the md simulations indicated a very slight increase (~ 0.11 nm ) of d1 from the initial value observed in only one md trajectory of csf - 1rmu .
the d2 profiles of the two proteins blend into each other , demonstrating that jm - s and c - lobe retained their relative position in the mutated receptor .
secondly , we calculated the binding energy associated to the interaction between jmr and kd. the free energy of binding ( deltag ) computed over the individual md simulations by the mmgbsa method showed a tendency of jmr to display a lower affinity with the kd in csf - 1rmu than in csf - 1rwt ( fig. 5b ) , similarly to previous observations in kitmu [ 31 ] .
apparently , this difference was more pronounced in kit than in csf - 1r , indicating a stronger coupling of jmr and kd in csf - 1r .
such a coupling stabilizes the overall protein structure and dynamical behavior evidenced by the low amplitude of the motions / fluctuations of jmr .

we also used the md simulations data to calculate the occurrences of h - bonds involving key residues that maintain the inactive auto - inhibited form of csf - 1r [ 22 ] .
the h - bonds describing the contacts of the jmr and the a - loop residues with the residues from n - and c - lobes are summarized in table 1 and illustrated in fig. 6 . 10.1371 / journal.pone.0097519.g006 figure 6 h - bond patterns in csf - 1r stabilising the auto - inhibited inactive state of csf - 1rwtand the non - inhibited inactive state of csf - 1rmu .

occurrences showed a major difference are denoted by asterisk .
the relative position of jm - b and kd residues in csf - 1rmu appeared to be unfavorable to the h - bonds pattern ( fig. 6a ) .
the occurrence of key h - bonds contributing to jmr anchoring to the kd , and to a - loop maintenance in an inactive conformation , were dramatically reduced in csf - 1rmu ( table 1 ) .
the interaction between the jmr and the n - lobe , which is stabilized by an h - bond between y546 ( jm - b ) and e633 ( calpha - helix ) , was reduced by a factor of 4 in csf - 1rmu compared to csf - 1rwt .
the occurrence of two other h - bonds , k545 *** d625 and y546 *** e626 , was reduced by a factor 2 in csf - 1rmu compared to csf - 1rwt .
an alternative h - bond involving y546 and d625 was detected in csf - 1rmu , suggesting a partial compensatory effect .
conversely , the h - bonds between the jmr and the catalytic loop from the c - lobe in csf - 1rmu display none or only slight changes respectively to csf - 1rwt ( table 1 , fig. 6b ) .
this observation indicates the strong coupling between the jmr and the c - lobe in both forms of receptor and correlates well with the highly conserved position of jmr respectively to kinase domain in csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
in addition to y546 , w550 is a crucial jm - b anchoring residue [ 22 ] that helps to hinder the active conformation of the a - loop by occupying the position that f797 ( dfg motif ) would acquire in the active form [ 21 ] .
representative structures derived from md simulations showed a displacement of w550 side chain away from the atp - binding site in csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu , when compared to its position in the crystallographic structure ( fig. 6c ) .
remarkably , the dfg motif in csf - 1rmu shows a conformational change in respect to csf - 1rwt in the crystal and in the md conformations ( fig. 6d ) .
all residues of the dfg motif in csf - 1rmu are slightly displaced from their positions in csf - 1rwt , and f797 side chain is pointed away from the atp - binding site .
such position of f797 described as an " in " conformation the dfg motif that is specific for the inactive non - autoinhibited conformation of the receptor .
the highly conserved residue f797 , appears to serve as a conformational switch in the receptor .
the a - loop inactive conformation was also stabilized by interaction of y809 ( a - loop ) as a pseudo - substrate with the catalytic loop residue d778 ( c - lobe ) in csf - 1rwt through the h - bond y809 *** d778 , which is decreased by a factor of 2 in csf - 1rmu .
this destabilizing effect in mutant is compensated by h - bond r801 *** d778 , favored by the displacement of the r801 towards d778 ( fig. 6c , table 1 ) .
further , we compared the electrostatic potential surfaces of jmr and kinase domain in both receptors .
the calculations were performed by the adaptive poisson - boltzmann solver ( apbs ) software using the crystallographic structures describing the inactive auto - inhibited state of the native receptors , csf - 1r ( pdb id : 2ogv , [ 22 ] and kit 1t45 , [ 21 ]) receptors .
although their structure is very similar , the two receptors display important sequence divergence in jmr ( fig. 1 ) and kid .
the jmr sequence contains 50 residues in kit and 43 residues in csf1r , including 8 basic residues in csf1r versus 6 in kit ; the number of polar residues is more significant in csf1r ( 18 ) than in kit ( 15 ) ( fig. 7a ) .
these subtle differences alter significantly the electrostatic surface of both proteins .
particularly in csf - 1r , the charge complementarity between the jmr and the kd surfaces favors direct contacts between them ( fig. 7b ) .
such profile in kit shows relatively limited complementarity between the jmr and kd surfaces .
the different profiles of the electrostatic potential surfaces in the two receptors are derived from the different nature of the amino acids compositions of this region , principally in jmr .
the strong coulomb interactions and the relevant h - bonds occurrences between jmr and kinase domain in csf - 1r indicate the tight coupling of these functional domains .

communication pathways in receptors and they functional role the jmr coupling with kinase domain controls the receptor activation process .
it has been described previously that allosteric coupling can be mediated solely by transmitted changes in the protein dynamics / motions as a consequence of a re - distribution of the protein conformational populations [ 76 ] , [ 80 ] - [ 83 ] .
we recently developed a novel method , the modular network analysis ( moneta ) , designed for accurate characterization of communication pathways in a protein by exploring the inter - residues dynamical correlations computed from md trajectories and the intramolecular non - bonded interactions [ 32 ] .
such approach applied to kit put in evidence a well - established communication between the jmr and the a - loop tyrosine y823 in kitwt , manifested as an extended network of h - bonds linking these two remote regions , the jmr and the a - loop , through the catalytic loop .
d792 and y823 , linked in kitwt by a strong and stable h - bond , were identified as key residues in establishing of communication pathways .
destruction of this h - bond in kitmu interrupted the allosteric coupling between these receptor segments leading to the structural changes in the jmr of kitd816v .
a study of csf - 1r using moneta was performed to ( i ) analyze the communication pathways in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor , ( ii ) evaluate the role of residue d802 in communication pathways and finally ( iii ) assess the impact of the d802v mutation on the protein internal communication network .
identification of the protein regions representing the most striking local features of the two proteins' internal dynamics was carried out using a statistical technique known as local feature analysis ( lfa ) [ 74 ] adapted from image processing to proteins [ 84 ] .
this method identifies clusters of residues named independent dynamic segments ( idss ) that are formed around each seed and display concerted local atomic fluctuations and independent dynamical behavior [ 32 ] .
the number of pca modes retained for lfa was 17 in csf - 1rwt and 19 in csf - 1rmu , the number of idss identified by moneta being 8 in csf - 1rwt and 9 in csf - 1rmu , respectively .
the idss differences between the two receptors concern their feature , location , and size .
to optimize the comparative analysis , the distinct idss were referred to as si , where i = 1,2 ,... , n. idss common to the two forms of receptor are located in jm - b ( s1 , residues 543 - 546 ) , in jm - s ( s2 , residues 553 - 562 in csf - 1rwt and 554 - 562 in csf - 1rmu ) , in the solvent - exposed loop that connects beta2 and beta3 ( s3 , residues 602 - 611 ) in the n - lobe , in the pseudo - kid ( s4 , residues 678 - 692 ) , in the a - loop ( s5 , residues 810 - 817 in csf - 1rwt and 809 - 817 in csf - 1rmu ) , and in the c - terminal tail ( s6 , residues 914 - 922 ) ( fig. 8 a,b ) .
the two idss specifically observed in csf - 1rwt were found in the c - lobe ( s7 , residues 856 - 862 of the loop that connects halpha - and galpha - helices ; s8 , residues 867 - 874 in the g - helix ) .
the three idss specifically observed in csf - 1rmu were localized in the n - lobe ( s9 ' , residues 617 - 624 of the loop that connects beta3 and calpha - helix ; s10 ' , residues 654 - 659 in the loop linking beta4 and beta5 ) and in the a - loop ( s5 ' , residues 802 - 806 ) .
interestingly , the residues forming s9 ' in csf - 1rmu were also found in s1 , suggesting that the jm - b and the loop linking beta3 and calpha - helix were associated in an entire self - reliant ids ( not shown ) .
the other unexpected observations were the participation of d802v and y809 in s5 ' and s5 , respectively .

the key residues in the communication networks are labelled ( in csf - 1rwt ) and depicted as bulky circles .
using moneta , we identified only one ids in the n - lobe of csf - 1rwt and three in that of kitwt [ 32 ] , whereas idss in the jmr , the a - loop , the pseudo - kid , and the g - helix were identical in the two native receptors .
the impact of the equivalent mutation on the idss in the cytoplasmic region of the two receptors is dissimilar .
in csf - 1rmu three novel idss , s5 ' , s9 ' and s10 ' , are a consequence of increased concerted local motions of the a - loop and the loops linking beta3 with calpha - helix , and beta4 with beta5 ( fig. 2 ) .
in kitmu such motion increase was observed only at the a - loop ; the motions in two other loops were diminished respectively to kitwt [ 31 ] .
the two a - loop idss , s5 and s5 ' , separated in csf - 1rmu , were observed as superimposed and duplicated idss in kitmu [ 32 ] .
the two key residues , the point mutation and the a - loop tyrosine , are involved in idss ( s5 ' and s5 respectively ) in csf - 1rmu , while in kitmu , only the point mutation is located in ids .
further , we studied the inter - residue communications linking different idss .
to quantify the inter - residues communications , we computed the number of communication pathways ( cps ) for each protein .
in virtue of the strong influence of the dynamical behavior onto the communication pathways , the calculation of cps was performed based on the individual md simulations .
for instance , the communication network computed over the 60 ns concatenated trajectory contains 1692 and 1626 non - redundant paths in csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu respectively , indicating the mutation - induced diminishing of the communication network in the receptor ( table 2 ) .
nevertheless , the total number of cps can vary considerably among the different replicas for both forms .

we were interested to investigate if the mutation d802v would compromise the communication between the receptor fragments determined as crucial in the activation mechanisms .
therefore , we looked for the cps derived from the mutation site d ( v ) 802 , the a - loop tyrosine y809 and the cps that connect jmr residues to other functional tkd segments , such as the p - loop , the calpha - helix and the c - loop , all involved in the stabilization of the inactive auto - inhibited conformation of the jmr ( table 2 ) .
despite a variation of the number of paths and their communication profile among the two replicas for the same system , the data characterizing different forms of receptor indicate that the jmr communication , especially when involving the jm - b , is considerably affected in csf - 1rmu respective to csf - 1rwt .
these data suggests that a local perturbation on the a - loop affects the jm - b communication with the p - loop and the calpha - helix , although jmr residues maintained a strong communication with the c - lobe , through the c - loop .
the differences in communication are illustrated using replica md 2 for both csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
the communication pathways identified by moneta form either local small cp clusters or extended networks ( fig. 8 c - d ) .
in csf - 1rwt , d802 is involved only in a local cp protruded to m804 in the small 310 - helix h2 of a - loop , posterior to the mutation site .
y809 initiated short cps with other a - loop residues , particularly with s807 , l817 , p818 , v819 and w821 .
similarly , to kitwt , no direct cp between the jmr and the a - loop in csf - 1rwt was identified .
nevertheless , the side chain of y809 points toward the c - loop , probably as an effect of the h - bond y809 *** d778 , highly prevalent during the md simulations ( table 1 ) .
moreover , d778 in the c - loop is involved in a cp extended toward the jmr ( fig. 8 c ) .
consequently , this cp can transmit information from the jm - s residues forming ids s2 to the catalytic ( c - ) loop residue d778 , and further , through the h - bond y809 *** d778 , to the a - loop residues .
the jm - s residues are involved in distinct cp networks providing connection of the jmr to the other functionally crucial fragments of the kinase domain .
the well - established communication pathways formed by the jm - b residues ( y546 and v548 ) with the p - loop ( f593 ) and the calpha - helix ( residues 628 - 633 ) , the extended cps from the jmr residues reaching the c - loop , and the ealpha - falpha - and halpha - helices , constitute a developed multi - branched cp network capable to coordinate the movements of n - and c - lobes involved in csf - 1r activation mechanisms , i.e. post - translational modifications and catalytic functions .
interestingly , the cps of each alpha - helix , calpha , ealpha , falpha and halpha , are extended over the entire helix length , making a structurally preformed communication fiber .
a considerable part of this extended cp network is completely lost in md 2 from csf - 1rmu , i.e. , no cp was observed between the jm - b and the p - loop , the calpha - , or the halpha - helices .
nevertheless , a relatively extended cp network is still observed between the jmr and the c - loop and the ealpha - helix in csf - 1rmu ( fig.8 d ) .
this remaining network establishes communication between d778 and the jm - switch but do not extend to the a - loop .
indeed , the h - bond y809 *** d778 controlling such cp extension in csf - 1rwt , shows a two - fold diminished prevalence in csf - 1rmu .
we also evidenced that , in csf - 1r , communication pathways connect s1 ( jm - binder ) and s2 ( jm - switch ) mainly to the molecular fragments not manifesting the concerted local atomic fluctuations ( idss ) , except s5 formed by residues from the a - loop beta - sheets .
the links between residues belonging to idss and the other receptor fragments involved in cps are held by h - bonds ( table 1 ) .
in csf - 1rmu , the absence of h - bonds between the jm - b and the calpha - helix residues significantly altered cp profiles .
diminished occurrence of the h - bond y809 *** d778 provokes the cp interruption between v802 and y809 which in csf - 1rmu are involved in s5 and s5 ' idss respectively. by contrast , the conserved h - bond pattern between the jmr residues involved in s1 and s2 idss and the catalytic loop partially preserves the cp that links these idss with the c - lobe residues similarly to csf - 1rwt .
our analysis showed that despite a comparable pattern of cps between the jmr and the a - loop in csf - 1r and kit , their functional roles appear to be different .
the established cp between the a - loop and the jmr through the catalytic ( c - ) loop is crucial for maintaining the allosteric regulation of the kd in kit and its disruption in kitmu is a major contribution to its constitutive activation [ 32 ] .
another particularity of the csf - 1r communication pattern consists of the jmr communication with the glycine - rich p - loop and with the calpha - helix , not observed in kit ( fig. s4 ) .
mutual cps of the jm - b residues with the calpha - helix are extended over the entire helix length in the native protein , while few and relatively small cps are observed in kit .
to search the origin of such difference in the two structurally similar receptors from the same rtks family having a considerable sequence identity , we pointed to the structural features of these receptors .
comparative inspection of the n - terminal domain structure in both receptors evidenced that position of the p - loop and the calpha - helix is ( i ) equivalent in the inactive state of both receptors ; ( ii ) conserved over the inactive - to - active forms transition in csf - 1r ; and ( iii ) highly dissimilar in kit active and inactive forms ( fig. s5 ) .
indeed , the p - loop and the calpha - helix in the active state of kit are shifted respectively to their positions in the inactive autoinhibited state .
the relative position of the p - loop and the calpha - helix in the active and inactive forms , which is equivalent in csf - 1r and divergent kit , may reflect their different implication in the mechanisms regulating the activation of the two receptors .
this hypothesis is coherent with the different communication pathways observed in the inactive autoinhibited state of these receptors .
nevertheless , such hypothesis requires an advanced examination of the structural features of both receptors in the active state .
the crystallographic structure of csf - 1r active form ( pdb id : 3lcd , [ 85 ]) was stabilized by a co - crystallized kinase inhibitor , while kit active state structure ( pdb id : 1pkg , [ 86 ]) was reported with two phosphorylated tyrosine residues ( y568 and y570 ) and with adp bound in the active site .
these structural peculiarities suggest that displacement of the p - loop and the calpha - helix in kit active state may be induced by phosphorylation events .
another issue consists of the role of the allosteric communication between jmr and a - loop in csf - 1r .
we evidenced early that disruption of this communication in kit mutant provokes a structural reorganization in the jmr , distant by more than 15 a from the point mutation .
such important structural reorganization evidenced as a folding of the beta - sheet of the jmr in kitmu should induce a distinct adaptation of the phosphotyrosine - based sites which in turn may affect downstream signalling , which might not be the case in csf - 1rmu .
as we evidenced , in the native receptors , the jmr is more attached to the kinase domain in csf - 1r than in kit .
the strong complementarities of surfaces maintain the position of jmr relative to kinase domain over the md simulations in csf - 1rwt and csf - 1rmu .
however the atomic fluctuations of the jmr and of the calpha - helix , increased significantly in csf - 1rmu , suggest that the mutation - induced long - range effect is also present in csf - 1r but much more subtle than in kit .
manifestation of this mutation - induced allosteric effect was evidenced by moneta , revealing the disruption of communication between jmr and a - loop in csf - 1r , similarly to kit .
concluding remarks the conformational plasticity of rtks endows these receptors with a wide range of functions that must be tightly tuned .
gain - of - function mutations can alter this tight tuning at different levels , including ligand binding , receptor dimerization , kinase domain conformation transition , and post - translational modifications .
these mutations can also trigger cell resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib , as demonstrated for d816v in kit and d802v in csf - 1r [ 78 ] .
such mutations might be expected to promote constitutive activation of the receptor and tumor formation [ 87 ] .
actually , kit d816v gain - of - function mutation is a well - characterized oncogenic event and identified in more than 80 % of systemic mastocytosis , whereas the equivalent csf - 1r d802v mutation has not been found in human tumors [ 17 ]. by combining various methods ( md , pca , nma , moneta ) to analyze and compare the structure and molecular dynamics of the native and mutated kit and csf - 1r , the present study demonstrates that the two homologous mutations do not have the same consequences in terms of receptor conformation and dynamics , providing a plausible explanation for the differential incidence of these mutations in oncology .
the local impact of d802v mutation , which is a partial unfolding of the small 310 - helix at proximity of the mutation site in csf - 1r , is very similar to that observed in kit d816v [ 31 ] .
mutation - induced stabilization of the inactive non - autoinhibited conformation of both receptors , non - adapted for binding of inhibitors targeting the inactive autoinhibited state , may explain the resistance to these inhibitors .
the two mutations also disrupt the allosteric communication between two essential regulatory fragments of the receptor , the jmr and the a - loop .
nevertheless , the similarity is limited to only this effect .
the mutation - induced shift towards an active conformation observed in kit d816v is not observed in csf - 1r d802v .
this differential impact on the conformational dynamics of the receptor , which might be related to differences in the primary sequence between the two wild - type receptors , particularly in the jmr region , could explain why the csf - 1r d802v does not confer a competitive advantage to the cell , thus is not retained as a driver oncogenic event .
nevertheless , it will be of interest to follow the response to new drugs , including small molecule kinase inhibitors , currently developed to target csf - 1r in cancer in which the receptor is often over - expressed , either on tumor cells or in the microenvironment [ 88 ] .
also , it is important to watch over the appearance of mutations allowing target cells to escape to the inhibitory activity of these drugs .

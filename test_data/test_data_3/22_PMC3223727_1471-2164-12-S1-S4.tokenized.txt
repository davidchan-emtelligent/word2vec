background recent advances in the field of metabolic engineering have been expedited by the availability of genome sequences and metabolic modelling approaches .
the complete sequencing of the c. reinhardtii genome has made this unicellular alga a good candidate for metabolic engineering studies ; however , the annotation of the relevant genes has not been validated and the much - needed metabolic orfeome is currently unavailable .
we describe our efforts on the functional annotation of the orf models released by the joint genome institute ( jgi ) , prediction of their subcellular localizations , and experimental verification of their structural annotation at the genome scale .
results we assigned enzymatic functions to the translated jgi orf models of c. reinhardtii by reciprocal blast searches of the putative proteome against the uniprot and aracyc enzyme databases .
the best match for each translated orf was identified and the ec numbers were transferred onto the orf models .
enzymatic functional assignment was extended to the paralogs of the orfs by clustering orfs using blastclust .
in total , we assigned 911 enzymatic functions , including 886 ec numbers , to 1,427 transcripts .
we further annotated the enzymatic orfs by prediction of their subcellular localization .
the majority of the orfs are predicted to be compartmentalized in the cytosol and chloroplast .
we verified the structure of the metabolism - related orf models by reverse transcription - pcr of the functionally annotated orfs .
following amplification and cloning , we carried out 454flx and sanger sequencing of the orfs .
based on alignment of the 454flx reads to the orf predicted sequences , we obtained more than 90 % coverage for more than 80 % of the orfs .
in total , 1,087 orf models were verified by 454 and sanger sequencing methods .
we obtained expression evidence for 98 % of the metabolic orfs in the algal cells grown under constant light in the presence of acetate .
conclusions we functionally annotated approximately 1,400 jgi predicted metabolic orfs that can facilitate the reconstruction and refinement of a genome - scale metabolic network .
the unveiling of the metabolic potential of this organism , along with structural verification of the relevant orfs , facilitates the selection of metabolic engineering targets with applications in bioenergy and biopharmaceuticals .
the orf clones are a resource for downstream studies .
background recent advances in sequencing genomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes [ 1 ] and the explosion of the development and use of genome - scale metabolic network reconstructions [ 2 ] are expected to facilitate the selection of targets for metabolic engineering [ 3,4 ]] . the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been an attractive organism for exploration of metabolic engineering hypotheses due to its capability to flexibly regulate alternative biochemical pathways to produce biofuels [ 6 - 9 ] .
however , the optimal selection of the enzymatic targets has been so far hindered by the lack of a comprehensive knowledge of the encoded genes that carry out the metabolic activities of the organism .
although the released genome sequence of c. renihardtii by the joint genome institute ( jgi ) [ 10 ] provided the needed resource to predict nearly 17,000 genes in this organism , it alone does not reveal the underlying principles of metabolic network function , nor does it disclose the functions of the predicted " parts - list " of the organism .
to define genes and map their products to function , computational algorithms have been extensively applied to annotate the accumulated genomic data from many organisms including c. reinhartii [ 11,12 ] .
most of these approaches are unable to predict the transcript structures precisely and accurately in a uniform manner due to 1 ) the incompleteness of the est data , 2 ) the lack of comparative genomic information , particularly in less widely studied species , and 3 ) the complexity of the rules governing transcription initiation , termination and splicing events .
even for the well - studied nematode c. elegans , for which a high quality genome sequence has been available for over 10 years , inconsistencies still remain in defining the orf structures [ 13,14 ]] .
previous large - scale studies on c. reinhardtii , have included microarray [ 15,16 ]] , proteomics [ 17 ] , and , more recently , rnaseq experiments [ 18 ] which have provided valuable expression data based on earlier releases of jgi annotations .
currently , the jgi v4.0 predicted c. reinhardtii orfeome remains for the most part unverified ; therefore , the functional annotation and experimental structural verification of the encoded orfs are urgently needed prior to use in functional studies including metabolic engineering experiments .
we previously reported the functional annotation of the gene products involved in central metabolism of c. reinhardtii using jgi v3.0 gene models [ 19 ] in which we improved the existing functional and structural annotations of the orf models .
in the re - evaluation of the central metabolic orfs , for which the orfs are generally the best characterized in the proteome , we observed that as much as 10 % of the orfs were annotated with structuralerrors .
the errors included incorrect 5 ' or 3 ' boundary annotations , which we identified through race [ 19 ] .
in this study , we computationally assigned enzyme functions to the predicted and newly released jgi v4.0 protein - coding orf models and targeted the enzymatic orfeome for structural verification .
our results , in addition to structural verification , provide expression evidence for the enzymatic gene products , predict their subcellular localization , and identify the orf models that may need to be re - annotated .
results and discussion functional annotation of jgi v4.0 transcripts we used the new jgi " filtered transcript models " released through the jgi portal ( http :// genome.jgi - psf.org / chlre4 / chlre4.home.html ) for both functional assignments and structural annotation verifications .
enzymatic functional assignments to the c. reinhardtii orfs were made by associating enzyme commission ( ec ) numbers through reciprocal blast searches against the uniprot enzyme database [ 20 ] ( http :// www.uniprot.org / , with over 100,000 protein entries ) ( figure 1a ) supplemented with aracyc database entries [ 21 ] . the best match for each translated orf was identified ( with an e - value threshold of 10 - 3 ) and the ec number from the uniprot best match ( or enzyme annotation from aracyc ) was transferred on to the jgi predicted orf .
we extended the ec assignments to the respective paralogs of the orfs by clustering orfs for the jgi filtered models .
altogether , we were able to assign 886 ec numbers to 1,427 jgi orfs ( figure 1b , additional file 1 ) .
kegg currently provides 603 enzymatic annotations for the jgi v4.0 transcripts , of which there are 441 shared with our annotation .
theassignments given in this study provide an additional 445 ec numbers not present in kegg .
the list of the enzymatic jgi v4.0 gene models with their assigned ec numbers are provided in additional file 1 .
figure 1 functional annotation of c. reinhardtii jgi v4.0 translated orfs .
enzymatic functions were assigned to the jgi v4.0 translated orfs by comparing the sequences with the uniprot and aracyc enzyme databases .
the computational pipeline ( a ) entailed transfer of enzyme annotation to jgi orfs identified through reciprocal blast , then establishing paralog groups to extend enzyme annotation to paralogs .
our functional annotation identified 886 ec numbers , of which only ~ 50 % are currently annotated by kegg ( b ) .
in order to provide additional functional information , wolf psort [ 22 ] was implemented to assign subcellular localizations to each translated jgi v4.0 enzymatic orf .
wolf psort is a high - performance localization prediction algorithm evolved from psort [ 23 ] , psort ii [ 24 ] and ipsort [ 25 ] ; it combines localization features from these algorithms together with amino acid composition in a weighted k - nearest neighbors framework .
based on the cross - validation results , wolf psort makes reliable predictions for nucleus , mitochondria , cytosol , plasma membrane , extracellular and ( in plants ) chloroplast .
for other subcellular compartments , the performance is not as good , but still informative [ 22 ] . compared to other methods , wolf psort has been shown to have good performance for most subcellular localizations [ 26 ] .
importantly , predictions are not made on the basis of signal sequences that can introduce vulnerability to errors in sequence and / or annotations on the 5 ' end of the gene [ 27 ] .
furthermore , due to the unique phylogenetic position of c. reinhardtii and a lack of extensive go annotation , alternative methods such as multiloc2 [ 28 ] , which use go annotation for refinement of predictions , would not be applicable here .
the results ( additional file 2 ) are presented as the number of nearest neighbors in different subcellular compartments for each protein .
the default value for the total number of nearest neighbors ( i.e. , k ) is 32 .
even though c. reinhardtii is in the plant lineage , it has retained key animal genes [ 10 ] and is a unicellular organism that shares ancestry at the branching point of plants and animals .
we therefore performed two wolf psort runs in which c. reinhardtii was considered either as a plant or animal .
because c. reinhardtii is closer to plants than animals [ 10 ] , predictions made when considering it as a plant are likely to be more accurate .
however , because wolf psort uses homology to known proteins , and some c. reinhardtii proteins may be closer to those in animals than plants [ 10 ] , the predictions assuming an animal lineage provide alternative assignments , particularly for cases where ambiguous predictions are made for the proteins assuming plant origins .
to summarize the obtained results ( fig. 2 ) , we have binned the encoded proteins based on the assigned probability values for each protein , such that , if more than 50 % of the nearest neighbors of the protein belong to a given compartment , that protein is assigned to a single compartment as its primary localization site .
in cases where different localization predictions made based on animal and plant assumptions both meet an 85 % cutoff , we took the higher confidence prediction as the final localization assignment ( additional file 3 ) .
using this integration scheme , the largest compartment is the chloroplast when c. reinhardtii is considered a plant , and the second largest is the mitochondrion ( fig. 2c ) .
these localization predictions agree with the fact that these genes are all related to metabolism .
to verify the performance of our predictions , we manually curated a number of experimentally derived c. reinhardtii subcellular protein localizations recently reported by weinkoop et al. [ 29 ] .
due to the limited number of localizations that could be transferred to v4.0 annotations from this study , we were only able to evaluate 9 orfs in our set .
our predicted localizations of all 9 orfs agreed with the experimentally determined localizations .
although the number is too small for adequate statistical analysis , it still shows the high quality of the predictions .
figure 2 subcellular localization prediction of jgi v4.0 enzymes .
following enzyme classification assignments to jgi v4.0 translated orfs , subcellular localization of the proteins were predicted by wolf psort [ 22 ] as plant ( a ) or animal ( b ) proteins .
based on the obtained probability values , each protein was assigned a compartment when 50 % or higher percentage of the nearest neighbors for the protein belonged to a given compartment .
when the 50 % threshold is not reached , the protein , or its encoding orf are assigned to " other " category to designate multiple compartments or ambiguous predictions .
in ( c ) , the predictions made as animal and plant were consolidated into a single set by increasing the threshold to 85 % , then reporting the predicted assignment with the higher value .

experimental verification of c. reinhardtii enzymatic orfeome our ec annotation of the jgi v4.0 transcript models identified 1,427 predicted transcripts with putative enzymatic functions .
to experimentally verify structural annotation of the enzymatic orfs , we carried out targeted transcriptome sequencing experiments after we amplified the orfs by reverse transcription - pcr ( rt - pcr ) ( figure 3a ) .
the generated amplicons were sequenced using the 454flx platform before and after cloning of the amplicons into a gateway vector .
the sequences of the clones were further verified by conventional sanger sequencing .
figure 3 orf verification by rt - pcr followed by multiplex sequencing .
rna isolated from c. reinhardtii grown under a permissive condition ( continuous illumination and acetate as a source of carbon ) was reverse transcribed , then used as template for pcr in which orf - specific primers were used to amplify the jgi annotated orfs .
the amplicons were then sequenced directly using the 454flx platform , or cloned , then sequenced by 454 .
( a ) amplification of representative metabolic orfs are shown after electrophoresis ( 192 amplicons analyzed in two 96 well e - gels ) .
( b ) percent coverage of 1,427 enzymatic orf reference sequences by the obtained reads from 454 sequencing .
the 454 reads were aligned to the jgi orf reference sequences and percent coverage of the length of each reference sequence was determined ( 100 % denotes all bases of the reference sequences could be covered by one or more 454 read ) .
the entire lengths of 699 orfs were 100 % verified .
in order to perform the verification experiments , we grew c. reinhardtii under permissive condition by providing light , organic carbon sources and other nutrients ( methods ) .
total rna from cells undergoing exponential growth was isolated and reverse transcribed to serve as a template for amplification of the orfs for which we designed gateway - tailed primers .
following amplification , we carried out next generation sequencing ( using the 454flx platform ) of the amplicons .
the obtained 454 reads were then aligned to the jgi v4.0 orf reference sequences to assess annotation accuracy .
the aligned orfs were binned according to their percent coverage ; i.e. , based on the percentage of the entire length of the orf reference sequence that could be covered by the contigs assembled from the 454 reads .
for 78 % of the jgi v4.0 orf reference sequences , the 454 reads provided 95 - 100 % coverage ( fig. 3b ; additional file 1 ) , of this set approximately 92 % had a coverage rate of 99 - 100 % , demonstrating high verification rates .
approximately 10 % of the orf models showed coverage of 50 - 95 % .
the remaining 12 % were covered less than 50 % and of this set , 7 % of the orf models had less than 20 % of their length verified by 454 - reads .
as an alternative method of verifying the orfs , we end - sequenced the cloned pcr products by conventional high - throughput sanger sequencing. from 1,427 jgi v4.0 orfs tested , we were able to obtain 661 orf sequence tags ( osts ) that were aligned to the 5 ' end of the orf models , and 631 osts that could be aligned to the 3 ' ends .
altogether , 42 % ( 602 ) orfs had osts that verified both ends of the orf models .
we could assemble full - length contigs for 242 orfs ( additional file 1 ) .
overall , we obtained expression evidence for 1,401 of 1,427 orf models with assigned enzymatic functions based on targeted transcriptome sequencing results and sequencing of the clones , though clearly not all of these orf models can be considered verified .
we consider an orf model to be verified if 98 to 100 % of its reference sequence could be covered by 454 - reads , or if a full - length contig generated from sanger sequencing of an obtained clone completely matched the reference sequence .
for 73 % of the orf models , the 454 - reads give confirmation at the 98 - 100 % level .
sanger sequencing of the clones could verify an additional 36 orf models ( for which we could assemble contigs using 3 ' and 5 ' end reads ) .
these models can therefore be considered verified , though it should be noted that even 100 % coverage of an orf model does not exclude the possibility of the presence of exons that were not annotated .
the high coverage rates do , however , guarantee that the annotated exons are expressed .
furthermore , incomplete coverage by 454 - reads does not necessarily imply inaccurate annotation ; in some cases , less than 100 % coverage could be the result of low expression level of the transcript and consequently low sequencing depth .
we note that due to the amplification of the transcripts , the targeted transcriptome method that we have used is expected to normalize the abundance of the amplicons to a degree .
while end verification by sanger sequencing can confidently verify the 5 ' and 3 ' ends , this method provides no information on the internal exon structure of long orfs ( unless internal primer walking [ 30 ] is carried out ) .
we also find that the overall success rate of sequencing clones using the sanger method is significantly lower than the 454 sequencing of amplicons .
cloning bottlenecks , failure to generate contigs due to end reads not covering the internal segments , and random sequencing failures could be among the contributing factors .
direct sequencing of amplicons through 454 or other parallel sequencing methods clearly bypasses these limitations .
conclusions a central challenge in the post - genomic era is the mapping of the genotype - phenotype relationship .
for biochemical networks , the functional connections between genotype and phenotype are deciphered through the use of the available high - throughput experimental and computational platforms .
each technology can be used to generate a vast amount of data particular to some aspects of a given biochemical network .
ultimately the gathered data could be used to manipulate the biochemical systems for biotechnological and medical purposes .
however , such efforts rest upon the availability of accurate structural and functional annotations , as well as the availability of the biological resources , such as orf clones .
in this study , we have carried out both computational functional annotation and direct experimental verification of structural annotations of jgi v4.0 enzymatic orfs , which include both metabolic and non - metabolic enzymes .
we carried out targeted amplification of the orfs by rt - pcr and sequenced the products ( before and after the cloning ) to verify the orf structures .
the approach of using targeted amplification of orfs offers several advantages over other high - throughput approaches that are not targeted ; importantly , it establishes the cis - connectivity between the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the orf .
such cis - connectivity cannot be established from whole transcriptome sequencing , tiling array analysis or other high - throughput transcriptome survey methodologies ( e.g. , [ 18,31 - 34 ]) .
in addition , the generated amplicons can be cloned , as we have done so here , to provide reagents for downstream large - or small - scale experiments , which can be used to define genotype to phenotype maps as well as accomplishing bio - engineering tasks. with an ever - increasing number of organisms whose genome sequences are becoming available ( e.g. , the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum [ 35 ] , the algae ostreococcus sp .
[ 36 ] and volvox carteri [ 37 ]) , the need for structural and functional annotation and their verification is clear .
the approach and experiments carried out in this study can be readily extended to other species to facilitate functional annotation and structural verification of their gene models .
methods enzyme annotation of jgi v4 proteome we assigned enzyme classification ( ec ) to the translated jgi v4.0 filtered orf models ( chlre4 _ best _ transcripts and chlre4 _ best _ proteins ) using uniprot [ 20 ] and aracyc [ 21 ] enzyme protein sequences and their ec annotations as the basis .
the transfer of enzyme annotations to orf models involved two main steps : ( 1 ) carrying out and deciphering reciprocal best - hits , if any , for each of the translated jgi orf models to the uniprot and aracyc sequences , then transferring the ec from the best - hits uniprot / aracyc sequences to the corresponding orf models .
this transfer was done using blastp with an e - value threshold 0.001 [ 38,39 ]] ; ( 2 ) identification of paralogs , in the entire collection of translated jgi models , of already ec assigned translated orf models and then transferring their ec annotations to their paralogs as well .
this transfer was done using blastclust ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / ieb / toolbox / c _ doc / lxr / source / doc / blast / blastclust.html ) with a sequence identity cut - off of 35 % and length cut - off of 70 % .
blastclust can cluster protein sequences ( using blast ) systematically through pair wise alignments when statistically significant matches are found .
importantly , blastclust uses " single - linkage " clustering , which allows linkage of clusters through their " best matching " components .
this aspect of the algorithm allows for clustering of sequences , which otherwise may lie below a set similarity threshold among themselves , but are linked through a sequence that has an above threshold similarity .
subcellular localization predictions wolf psort [ 22 ] was used to assign subcellular localizations to each translated jgi v4.0 enzymatic orfs .
the output for each orf provides the number of nearest neighbors in different subcellular compartments for each protein .
the default value for total number of nearest neighbors ( i.e. , k ) is 32 .
for each protein , the result can be transformed into a probability model : where ci is the ith subcellular compartment ; n ( ci ) is the number of nearest neighbors the protein has for the ith subcellular compartment , and m is the total number of subcellular compartments predicted for the protein .
we carried out the localization assignments of c. reinhardtii orfs considering it as a plant and animal. c. reinhardtii strain and growth condition c. reinhardtii strain cc - 503 was used for our experiments. c. reinhardtii cells were grown in tris - acetate - phosphate ( tap ) medium containing 100 mg l - 1 carbamicillin without agitation , at room temperature ( 22 - 25 degreesc ) and under continuous illumination with cool white light at a photosynthetic photon flux of 60 mumol m - 2 s - 1 .
rna isolation and quality assessment total rna was isolated from c. reinhardtii cells grown in tap medium and under constant light .
cells from mid - log phase were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm ( 650g ) for 10 min .
total rna was isolated using trizol reagent ( invitrogen ) .
the quality of the isolated rna was improved by digesting the remainder of the cellular dna using 0.08 u microl - 1 rnase - free dnase i enzyme ( ambion ) .
the integrity and quality of the total rna was assessed by agilent 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent ) using rna pico 6000 kit and by following the manufacturer 's instruction .
the fraction of rna with rna integrity number ( rin ) of more than 7.5 was used for cdna synthesis .
the concentration of the rna was measured spectrophotometrically .
structural verification of the jgi v4.0 transcripts : reverse transcription - pcr of the metabolic orfs the annotated metabolic orfs were subjected to reverse transcription followed by pcr to verify their predicted sequences .
reverse transcription of rna was carried out using superscript iii reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen ) following the manufacturer 's instructions using random n6 and dt ( 16 ) ( ambion ) as universal primers .
the reaction mixture contained 1.2 m betaine ( sigma - aldrich ) to prevent premature terminations owing to the high g + c content of the c. renhardtii transcriptome .
the synthesized cdnas were used as templates in pcr reactions .
orf - specific primers tailed with gateway compatible sequences were designed automatically using the osp program [ 40 ] the forward primer starts from nucleotide a of the atg start codon and was flanked with the gateway b1.1 sequence at its 5 ' end .
the reverse primer starts from the codon immediately before the termination codon and carried the gateway b2.1 sequence at its 5 ' end .
all primers had a melting temperature ( tm ) between 55 degreesc and 65 degreesc .
kod hot start dna polymerase ( novagen ) catalyzed the amplification of ~ 1,430 orfs individually in separate 50 microl reaction mixtures containing 1.2 m betaine and 0.25 microg / microl cdna .
gateway cloning of the metabolic orfs , their transformation and amplicon generation for sequencing the generated amplicons were recombinationally cloned into the pdonr223 gateway vector to generate entry clones [ 41 ] .
the recombinational cloning was performed using bp clonase ( invitrogen ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
the entry clones were subsequently transformed into chemically competent e. coli dh5alpha .
the positive transformants were selected and grown in 96 - well format plates containing lb and 100 mg / l spectinomycin .
following growth in liquid media , the transformed bacteria were used as a source of template in pcr reactions containing 1.2 m betaine and kod hot start dna polymerase ( novagen ) to amplify the clones .
vector primers were used to generate the final dna templates for sequencing .
generation of orf sequence tags ( osts ) by sanger sequencing pcr products were sequenced bi - directionally using conventional automated cycle sequencing to generate orf sequence tags ( osts ) [ 42 ] .
sequencing was carried out by agencourt bioscience corp .
forward and reverse sequences were vector - clipped ( using cross _ match , http :// www.phrap.org / phredphrap / general.html ) , then assembled .
we used phrap ( http :// www.phrap.org /) to assemble the forward and reverse sequences .
both assembled contigs and singlets were aligned against the coding sequences ( cdss ) of corresponding predicted transcripts from c. reinhardtii assembly v4.0 ( http :// genome.jgi - psf.org / chlre4 / chlre4.home.html ) using muscle [ 43,44 ]] .
the alignment files were then used to verify the cdss of the predicted transcripts .
an orf model was considered verified if a contig could be assembled from both end reads and if the contig verifies the predicted sequence .
orf model verification by 454flx sequencing the generated orf amplicons were sequenced using the 454flx titanium sequencing system ( 454 life sciences corp. , roche ) .
for targeted transcriptome sequencing , the amplicons generated in rt - pcr reactions were pooled in equimolar ratios .
for verification of cloned orfs , the pcr products of the entry clones were pooled in equimolar quantities .
the resulting mixes were partially purified using qiagen minelute pcr purification kit following the manufacturer 's instruction .
five micrograms of dna from each sample was subjected to nebulization for 90 seconds under nitrogen gas pressure of 30 psi ( 2.1 bar ) .
after purification of the sheared dna using the minelute pcr purification kit , the dna fragments were size - selected using ampure beads ( agencourt ) .
dna fragments with the size range of 300 - 800 bp were end repaired and the adaptors were ligated to the ends .
after melting into single stranded dna molecules , the quality of the dna library was assessed on a bioanalyzer rna pico 6000 labchip ( agilent ) .
the resulting single stranded dna libraries were then purified and used to set up emulsion pcr reactions according to the manufacturer 's instruction ( 454 life sciences corp. , roche ) .
after the amplification step , the emulsions were chemically broken and the beads carrying the amplified dna library were recovered and enriched .
the sequencing was performed on the roche 454 genome sequencer instrument with the gs flx titanium sequencing kit xlr70 .
approximately 800,000 dna - carrying beads along with enzyme and packing beads were loaded onto a picotitreplate device .
the sequencing was operated and monitored for ~ 9 hrs during which 200 flow cycles were completed .
the generated data were processed using the gs flx data analysis software v2.3 .
the vector sequences and gateway tail sequences were trimmed from the raw reads and the reads shorter than 20 nt were filtered out .
the trimmed and filtered reads were aligned against jgi v4.0 reference sequences using the gs reference mapper application ( gsmapper v2.3 ) .
a minimum overlap length of 40 nt and minimum overlap identity of 90 % were used to align the reads against the jgi v4.0 reference sequences .
an orf model was called verified if more than 98 % of its entire length was covered by ( matched to ) the assembled contigs from the 454 reads .

graphene oxide ( go ) has become a well - established reinforcement for polymer - based nanocomposites .
it provides stronger interfacial interaction with the matrix when compared with that of graphene , but its intrinsic stiffness and strength are somewhat compromised because of the presence of functional groups damaging the graphene lattice and increasing its thickness , and its tendency to adopt a crumpled structure .
although the micromechanics of graphene reinforcement in nanocomposites has been studied widely , the corresponding micromechanics investigations on go have not been undertaken in such detail .
in this work , it is shown that the deformation micromechanics of go can be followed using raman spectroscopy and the observed behaviour can be analysed with continuum mechanics .
furthermore , it is shown that the reinforcement efficiency of go is independent of its number of layers and stacking configurations , indicating that it is not necessary to ensure a high degree of exfoliation of go in the polymer matrix .
it also demonstrates the possibility of increasing the concentration of go in nanocomposites without sacrificing mechanical reinforcement efficiency .

introduction graphene - related materials are promising candidates as reinforcements in polymer nanocomposites owing to their combination of high modulus and strength [ 1 ] .
additionally , their wide range of other impressive physical properties makes it possible to develop multifunctional nanocomposites [ 1,2 ] .
the deformation mechanics of pristine graphene has been extensively studied , both in the free - standing state [ 3 ] and during reinforcement in nanocomposites [ 1,4,5 ] .
in particular , it has been shown , by using the strain - sensitive shifts of the raman bands , that the deformation of graphene follows continuum mechanics developed for macroscale fillers [ 6 - 8 ] , and the interfacial shear stress with a polymer matrix is of the order of 2 mpa [ 5,9 ] .
however , graphene is hard to disperse homogeneously in a polymer matrix because of its tendency to agglomerate and the poor compatibility of its chemically inert surface with the matrix .
additionally , for multilayer graphene , its reinforcement efficiency reduces as a result of poor interlayer stress transfer [ 10,11 ] , which can further cause a loss of the bernal stacking in the multilayer graphene that is regained upon unloading [ 12 ] .
in contrast , the presence of functional groups on its derivative , graphene oxide ( go ) , give a good degree of matrix - reinforcement interaction leading to improved dispersion and stress transfer [ 13 ] .
however , the presence of the functional groups in the go both damages the graphene lattice and increases flake thickness , leading to a loss of intrinsic stiffness by a factor of approximately 4 [ 14 ] .
these competing factors strongly suggest that there may be an optimal degree of functionalization that gives sufficient matrix interaction without significantly reducing the stiffness .
the young modulus of monolayer go has been shown to be of the order of 250 gpa [ 14 ] .
a computer simulation estimated a maximum interfacial shear stress for a go nanocomposite to be more than 130 mpa at the edges of reduced go flakes with a size of approximately 30 mum [ 15 ] , significantly higher than the maximum interfacial shear stress for graphene [ 5,9 ] .
go - based paper has also been investigated and it displays a good layered structure that endows exceptionally high stiffness [ 13 ] .
although the deformation mechanisms of monolayer go and its impregnated papers have been studied extensively [ 13,16 - 19 ] , a comparison implies that the factors that affect the stiffness of go - based materials differ significantly with length scale [ 20 ] .
even more importantly , as an intermediate material between monolayer go and go paper , few - layer go ( number of layers less than 20 ) and multilayer go ( number of layers over 20 ) have been studied less extensively regarding their reinforcement of bulk nanocomposites .
in particular , the deformation / reinforcement mechanics of go with different number of layers has not been studied systematically .
this may be due to the difficulty in fabricating nanocomposites reinforced solely with mono - or few - layer go flakes .
in addition , it is also not easy to manipulate the complicated stacked go structure in micromechanical testing instruments .
despite these difficulties , few - layer go could , in fact , have even wider application : ( i ) it is easier to prepare than monolayer go and is thus more amenable to scale - up ; ( ii ) it is more likely to be present than monolayer go in some nanocomposite matrices , especially hydrophobic polymers , or even ceramics and metals ; and ( iii ) bulk nanocomposites based on stacked go have more practical applications than go paper .
in this work , the deformation mechanics of mono - , bi - to multilayer go structures with different stacking configurations have been studied .
the shift of the raman d band position ( omegad ) of go as a function of strain epsilon has been used to follow the deformation mechanics of monolayer go flakes to investigate the validity of continuum mechanics on the microscale .
based on the estimation of the effective young modulus of go [ 21 ] , its shift rate with strain ( domegad / depsilon ) is further used to compare the reinforcement efficiency of a series of different go flakes .
2. experimental ( a ) materials the graphite ( grade 2369 ) was supplied by graphexel ltd .
all other reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification .
( b ) preparation the go was prepared using the modified hummers method , and the details of preparation can be found elsewhere [ 21 - 23 ] .
after graphite was oxidized , the go was dispersed in water , diluted to less than 10 - 3 mg ml - 1 and deposited onto poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) beam followed by drying under ambient conditions .
prior to the go deposition , the pmma beams were treated using a uv - ozone plasma , facilitating the spreading of the go dispersion and also the adhesion of the go to the substrate .
( c ) characterization transmission mode fourier - transform infrared ( ftir ) spectrum was obtained from dried go powder mixed with kbr , using a nicolet 5700 spectrometer ( thermofisher scientific inc. ) .
x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was carried out on dried go powder using an x'pert dy609 x - ray diffractometer ( philips ) with a cu - kalpha radiation source ( lambda = 1.542 a ) .
atomic force microscope ( afm ) images were obtained using a dimension 3100 afm ( bruker ) in the tapping mode in conjunction with a ' tespa ' probe ( bruker ) .
raman spectra were obtained using renishaw 1000 / 2000 spectrometers and a horiba labram hr evolution spectrometer equipped with hene lasers ( lambda = 633 nm ) with laser spot sizes of around 1 - 2 mum .
the incident laser polarization was parallel to the strain , whereas the scattered radiation was randomly polarized .
the specimens were deformed in a four - point bending rig , and the strain was measured using a strain gauge placed close to the region being analysed [ 24 ] .
3. results and discussion ( a ) microstructure the ftir spectrum of the go is shown in figure 1a , where a number of absorption bands , corresponding to the presence of functional groups , can be observed .
for example , the band around 1710 cm - 1 can be attributed to the c = o stretching of the ketonic species , and the band around 1620 cm - 1 is assigned to alkene in the graphitic region .
the epoxy c - o - c bonds generate a band at around 1230 cm - 1 , whereas the band resulting from the c - oh stretching is located around 1070 cm - 1 [ 25 ] .
these functional groups were introduced after oxidation [ 26 ] and expand the interlayer separation , as confirmed using xrd ( figure 1b ) , where the characteristic peak for the go at 2theta = 10.5degrees corresponds to an interlayer spacing of 0.84 nm , in good agreement with the reported value [ 16 ] .
figure 1 .
( a ) ftir spectrum and ( b ) xrd pattern for the go powder .
( b ) deformation of monolayer graphene oxide as reported previously [ 1,4,5,9 ] , the deformation of graphene can be followed using raman spectroscopy .
the small spot size of the raman laser enables the spatial resolution of the measurement down to micrometre dimensions , thus revealing the local strain distribution accurately in individual flakes .
however , unlike the raman spectrum of graphene where the number of layers can be identified through a fingerprint spectrum [ 5,27 ] , the raman spectra of go are very similar , regardless of the number of layers .
this makes the analysis very difficult especially with go flakes on the top of a polymer substrate .
hence , afm was used here as a supplementary technique to find , identify and characterize the go flakes ( figure 2 ) .
it was carried out in tapping mode , so that no damage was induced in the structure of the go , as confirmed in s1 of the electronic supplementary material .
it can be seen that the go flake in figure 2 has a lateral dimension of over 15 mum , and the height profile obtained clearly shows it has a thickness of the order of 1 nm , demonstrating its monolayer nature ( figure 2 ) .

( b ) afm image of the go flake , where the black spot indicates where the deformation was monitored .
( c ) height profile along the red line in ( b ) , and the red lines in ( c ) are guides to the eyes showing the thickness of the flake .
a raman spectrum was then obtained from this typical monolayer go flake as shown in figure 3 .
the most prominent bands in the spectrum are the g band and d band .
the g band , located at approximately 1600 cm - 1 , is due to the doubly degenerate e2g vibrational mode at zone centre [ 27 ] .
the d band , centred at approximately 1330 cm - 1 , results from the a1g symmetry k point phonons [ 28 ] .
the small band around 1450 cm - 1 is from the pmma substrate .
the broadening of the d and g bands compared with those of graphene [ 27 ] is possibly due to the loss of lattice symmetry as a result of the breaking down of the sp2 carbon networks of pristine graphene by the strong oxidation [ 28,29 ] , implying a higher degree of disorder [ 30,31 ] .
this also explains the weaker signal and more scattered data points than those of graphene [ 1 ] , because the damaged graphene hexagonal lattice leads to a loss of the resonance raman scattering .
both d band and g band were fitted with a single lorentzian peak , as shown in figure 3 .
the value of the ratio of the intensity of the two bands , id / ig , can actually be used as a measure of the degree of disorder of go [ 30,32 ] .
it should be noted that a d '' band ( approx. 1520 cm - 1 ) also needs to be considered , with a gaussian function fitting needed to account for the broad shoulder between the d and g bands , which may be linked to the structural disorder of the go [ 33,34 ] .
even though another d ' band around 1620 cm - 1 is present [ 19,33 ] , the curve fitting employed is still thought to be a good first approximation considering the spectral resolution and disordered structure .
figure 3 .

another issue for concern is that go , being chemically different from graphene because of the functional groups [ 35 ] , may make it more vulnerable to damage under the raman laser beam , where it may tend to undergo , for example , heat reduction [ 36 ] or photoreduction [ 37 ] .
to avoid this , a laser with a relatively long wavelength ( lambda = 633 nm ) was used in this work because of the absorption peak of go in the higher energy region near approximately 250 nm [ 36 ] .
local laser heating was also avoided by using low laser power .
the lack of beam damage was indicated by the constant value of id / ig after four / five scans on both monolayer and bilayer go flakes ( electronic supplementary material , figure s2 ) [ 30,32 ] .
the go was then deformed stepwise and raman spectra were collected at each strain level .
the raman d band was used to follow the deformation of the go [ 37 ] .
this band was preferred to the normal raman bands used to follow deformation in graphene [ 38 ] , the two - dimensional band [ 32 ] which is weak and broadened in go and the g band [ 19 ] which is asymmetric .
the d band was used to monitor the deformation of a point in the central region of the flake ( figure 2 ) , where good stress transfer should take place [ 5 ] .
a clear downshift of omegad can be seen during deformation of the go to 1.0 % strain ( figure 4 ) , as a result of the elongation of the c - c bonds during deformation [ 8,39 ] .
the variation of omegad with strain determined at the point shown in figure 2 was used to follow the deformation of the go flake in situ ( figure 5 ) .
an approximately linear downshift with strain was observed as the go was deformed to 0.4 % strain , with a slope domegad / depsilon of - 14.9 cm - 1 /% .
this was the result of the elastic stress transfer from the substrate to the go. the slope domegad / depsilon decreases somewhat at a higher strain as can be seen in electronic supplementary material , figure s3 , perhaps indicating partial interfacial failure [ 5,9,40 ] , or a variation of gruneisen parameter with strain [ 41 ] .
figure 4 .

the black and red curves , respectively denote the curves fitted as shown in figure 3 .
figure 5 .
the raman d band position omegad as a function of strain of the go flake , measured at the point in figure 2. from the knowledge of the gruneisen parameter [ 8,39,42 ] , it has been demonstrated that , for an ideal graphene crystal , domegad / depsilon under uniaxial tensile strain should be related to it through a relation of the form [ 8,43 ] 3.1 where omega0d is omegad at zero strain , gammad is the gruneisen parameter for the d band and nu is the poisson ratio of the pmma substrate .
based on equation ( 3.1 ) , if a value of gammad = 3.55 is used [ 8 ] , and nu is taken as 0.35 for the pmma substrate [ 44 ] , the reference value of domegad / depsilon (( domegad / depsilon ) ref ) for supported graphene should be of the order of - 30 cm - 1 /%.[ 8 ] the value obtained here is just approximately half of that for graphene [ 8,43 ] , probably due to the structural distortion resulting from the sp3 hybridization of carbon atoms [ 45 ] and waviness or crumples [ 40 ] .
these factors could easily decrease the value of domegad / depsilon for go by a factor of 2 [ 46 ] and the value of domegad / depsilon determined here is in good agreement with the value estimated during the deformation of a variety of nanocomposites [ 47 ] .
( the value of domegad / depsilon in reference [ 47 ] was calculated for free - standing go excluding the effect of poisson ratio , while here it is for supported go. ) at higher strain levels ( electronic supplementary material , figure s3 ) , the value of domegad / depsilon decreases , corresponding to less - efficient interfacial stress transfer [ 5,9,40 ] , or a dependence of the gruneisen parameter on strain [ 41 ] .
this less - efficient stress transfer may be due to the intrinsically weak bonding between pmma and go [ 48 ] .
there is , however , still stress transfer taking place , probably due to the friction [ 9 ] as a result of the interaction between the functional groups and the substrate and also the rough morphology of the go surface [ 49 ] .
( c ) deformation mechanics of monolayer graphene oxide similar to our earlier studies on monolayer pristine graphene [ 1 ] , raman spectra were collected from different points going from the edge of the go flake to its central region , as indicated by the dashed white line in figure 2 .
this was done for different levels of strain applied to the pmma beam .
the linear fit in figure 5 can be used as a calibration to correlate omegad with local value of strain epsilon in the go flake [ 1,4,5,9 ] .
it can be seen in figure 6 that , before deformation , the strain distribution from the go flake edge to the centre was approximately 0 % .
when the pmma beam was deformed to 0.24 % and then to 0.40 % strain , the strain in the central region of the go flake increased uniformly , with the strain in the go being similar to that of the pmma beam , confirming good interfacial stress transfer from the substrate to the central region of the go flake , as has been found before for graphene [ 5,9 ] .
figure 6 .
the strain distribution of the go flake at a strain of ( a ) 0 % , ( b ) 0.24 % and ( c ) 0.40 % .
( online version in colour. ) there is , however , a major difference between the behaviour of go and graphene near the flake edge .
the deformation mechanics of graphene and go can be described using the well - known ' shear - lag ' theory ( s4 in electronic supplementary material ) .
however , in this work , within the scatter in the data , the strain distribution appears to be constant with position along the flake , whereas in the case of pristine graphene , the strain falls over several micrometres to zero near the edge of the flake due to shear lag effects , enabling the ' critical length ' of the graphene for good reinforcement to be determined [ 5,9,50 ] .
this could be partially due to the weak raman scattering from go , and also the difficulty to clearly identify the poorly resolved go edge under the optical microscope ( figure 2 ) .
it does , however , also suggest a shorter ' critical length ' compared with that of graphene .
another factor that needs to be taken into account is the spatial resolution of the raman laser ( 1 - 2 mum ) , which means that values of ' critical length ' around 1 mum will be difficult to measure [ 51 ] .
in any case , the data still clearly imply that the critical length for go is very short , hence in figure 6 only straight lines were drawn instead of curves derived from the ' shear - lag ' analysis , for simplicity .
this is a result of the presence of functional groups in the go , and thus implies that , in nanocomposites , the interaction formed between go and the polymer matrix especially when processed in situ , such as for epoxy resins , will lead to a stronger interface .
it also explains the higher measured values of strength and toughness of go nanocomposites than for nanocomposites reinforced with less functionalized graphene - based materials [ 52,53 ] .
further effort is still needed for a clearer identification of the strain distribution at the edge of a go flake .
( d ) deformation of few - layer graphene oxide it has been shown that in pristine graphene with no functional groups the reinforcement efficiency decreases as the number of layers increases [ 11 ] , as a result of the poor interlayer stress transfer [ 10 ] .
following the analysis on monolayer go , it was therefore instructive to compare its behaviour with that of go with different numbers of layers and stacking configurations .
model go configurations have also been fabricated on pmma beams with different number of go layers , ranging from mono - , bi - , tri - to multilayer ( denoted as xl , where x is the number of layers , for multilayers denoted as its thickness in nm , assuming for simplicity that the thickness of the go monolayers is approximately 1 nm ) , which were again identified using afm .
their corresponding values of domegad / depsilon are shown in figure 7 , and it is seen that , even though the number of layers varies , the value of domegad / depsilon does not change significantly .
figure 7 .
the raman d band shift rate domegad / depsilon ( left ) and eeffgo ( right ) of go flakes for different layer number / stacking configurations .
( online version in colour. ) as well as the number of layers , what is notable is the stacking configuration of the go flakes .
some of the go flakes display a stacked multilayer structure , whereas others have a re - stacked structure ( prefixed as rs before the thickness as in figure 7 ; for example , rs 1 + 3l means the re - stacked mono - and tri - layers ; the full definition is shown in s5 in the electronic supplementary material ) , formed probably during the deposition of the go on the pmma substrate .
regardless of this difference , however , the values of domegad / depsilon are still similar as highlighted with stars in figure 7 .
several of the re - stacked go flakes that were tested are shown in figure 8 , where it can be seen that they have re - stacked after being exfoliated .

( e ) reinforcement efficiency of graphene oxide it has been demonstrated previously that the value of domegad / depsilon can be used to estimate the effective young modulus of go ( eeffgo ) in nanocomposites [ 37 ] .
the average value of domegad / depsilon measured in this present study was approximately - 12.8 cm - 1 /% strain for monolayer go. the effective young modulus of go compared with pristine graphene can be calculated from the reduced value of domegad / depsilon due to lattice damage and the increase in thickness as a result of the oxidation of the go using the equation 3.2 where ( domegad / depsilon ) ref is the d - band shift rate for graphene ( approx. - 30 cm - 1 /%) , tgra is the thickness of graphene ( 0.34 nm ) , tgo is the thickness of go measured in this present study and egra is the young modulus of graphene .
this equation yields a value of eeffgo ~ 180 gpa for the go , in broad agreement with but slightly lower than the value reported for an indentation test on a go membrane [ 14 ] .
this slightly lower value might be the result of the lack of strong adhesion between the go flakes and the pmma substrate .
as the number of go layers increases , up to tens of layers , the eeffgo of go of n layers ( eeffgo ( n )) derived from the raman band shift data ( figure 7 ) still does not change significantly compared with the rapidly decreasing value for graphene [ 11 ] .
this phenomenon implies a similar stiffness of go , regardless of the number of layers .
it can be attributed to the good interlayer adhesion between the go flakes , at least up to the number of layers evaluated .
in order to study the interlayer stress transfer efficiency , a model originally developed for carbon nanotubes [ 54,55,56 ] and then for model graphene nanocomposites can be modified for this present study as [ 11 ] 3.3 where the eeffgo ( n ) values are calculated from equation ( 3.2 ) , and k is the interlayer stress transfer efficiency factor , ranging between 0 and 1 .
as all the go flakes will have the same contact with the pmma substrate , the value of eeffgo ( 1 ) is used as the reference in equation ( 3.3 ) , the k worked out only reflects the interlayer adhesion of go instead of the interface with pmma substrate .
the calculated eeffgo ( n )/ eeffgo ( 1 ) is plotted as a function of the number of go layers with a series of values of k in figure 9 , represented by the coloured lines .
in order to count the number of layers , the thickness of monolayer go was taken as 1 nm for simplicity .
in this situation , if k = 1 , eeffgo ( n )/ eeffgo ( 1 )= 1 , the stress can be transferred completely through the bottom layer to the top layer , thus the effective modulus of go would be identical , regardless of the number of layers .
for all the other values of k , the ratio of eeffgo ( n )/ eeffgo ( 1 ) decreases as the number of layers increases , in accordance with a gradual loss of the interlayer stress transfer from layer to layer .
particularly , for k = 0 , eeffgo ( n )/ eeffgo ( 1 )= 1 / n , only the bottom layer bears the load , and no stress transfer occurs to the upper layers , hence the effective modulus varies inversely with the number of layers ( cross - section area ) .
it can be seen in figure 9 that most of the data points , except two , obtained in this work fall around the line where k equals unity , suggesting almost complete interlayer stress transfer in the go flakes , regardless of the different number of layers and stacking configurations .
figure 9 .
values of as a function of thickness of the go flakes .
the interlayer stress transfer efficiency factor k is taken as different values as shown in coloured lines .
the shadowed regions represent a range of k values in the corresponding thickness range .
this behaviour of go is remarkably different from that of graphene [ 11 ] , for which its chemically inert surface makes interlayer sliding relatively easy , certainly in a multilayer graphene crystal [ 11,12 ] and probably also for restacked material .
in contrast , go behaves more like a ' solid ' material , where the layers are strongly bonded to each other and interlayer sliding is less likely to occur , at least in the thickness range studied in this work .
the finding here suggests a comparable young modulus of few - layer go to that of monolayer go. this is well supported by the previous conclusion that the young modulus of go membranes scales with their number of layers , when assuming a constant thickness .
if a thickness change is considered , it actually suggests the independence of the young modulus upon the number of go layers [ 14 ] .
this behaviour can be interpreted as being due to the hydrogen bonding controlled by the functional groups and also the water content [ 57 ] , which therefore leads to a strong interlayer adhesion [ 20 ] .
this also explains why the few - layer go fractures due to an intraplanar failure mechanism rather than a ' pull - out ' mechanism when subjected to deformation [ 20 ] .
nevertheless , as we found and also reported in the literature , this situation is probably valid only up to tens of nanometres [ 20 ] .
as the length scale increases to bulk materials such as go - impregnated papers , other effects such as defects and voids [ 58 ] , misorientation [ 47 ] and waviness [ 40 ] of the go will inevitably become dominant and will affect mechanical properties , whereby ' interplanar ' failure mechanisms start to appear [ 20,58 ] .
hence , a dependence of the young modulus of go paper upon its thickness has been found on the macroscopic scale [ 58 ] .
in our samples , the go forms after being oxidized and further separates in aqueous solution [ 26,59 ] .
the remaining 2.2 wt % sulfur ( as measured in elemental analysis ) or water [ 35 ] can result in cross - link bonding between neighbouring go layers that prevents them being separated even after oxidation [ 26,59 ] .
this is similar to the previous microscopic observation that two functionalized go flakes with identical geometries stick together even after oxidation [ 59 ] .
this is evidenced by the constant measured value of domegad / depsilon , which would otherwise be expected to vary depending on the number of layers , as for graphene [ 11 ] , where only the weak van der waals forces act [ 10,11,12 ] , when it had not been completely exfoliated .
even after the go flakes were separated in water , the strong interlayer adhesion can be recovered after re - stacking .
this is also the result of the water molecules being introduced during sample preparation that help to re - interconnect the separate go flakes , giving interlayer adhesion comparable to that of the non - exfoliated counterparts .
these features of stacked and re - stacked go flakes can be instructive for their use in go - based nanocomposites .
first , because of the strong interlayer adhesion , it is thought that there is less need to ensure a complete exfoliation of go ( less than 40 layers should suffice ) .
as it is the go flakes with large lateral dimensions that take longer times to be fully exfoliated [ 26 ] , this removes the necessity for complete exfoliation , allowing the moderate treatment , which in return avoids the damage of the lateral flake dimension , thus giving better reinforcement [ 5,60 ] .
second , the strong interlayer adhesion recovered after re - stacking justifies the use of nanocomposites with high go loadings without sacrificing the potential loss of mechanical performance due to go re - aggregation [ 48 ] .
it is expected that an even better interlayer adhesion might be obtained through further functionalization of go [ 52,57 ] .
4. conclusion this work has presented a method to monitor the deformation mechanics of go with different number of layers and stacking configurations using raman spectroscopy .
the stress / strain - sensitive raman d band was used , and the measured value of the shift of the position of the raman d band with strain , domegad / depsilon , has been used to map the deformation of a monolayer go flake , so that the strain distribution of the go flake could be revealed .
additionally , the measured value of domegad / depsilon has also been used to estimate the effective young modulus eeffgo of go flakes with different thickness .
it is found to be almost constant , regardless of the number of layers or the stacking / re - stacking configuration .
this was attributed to the good interlayer stress transfer provided by hydrogen bonding between the layers .
it suggests that there is no need to exfoliate the go completely when preparing nanocomposites .
this also has the advantage of enabling flakes with relatively large lateral dimension to be prepared which will still have a significant positive impact on the reinforcement .
furthermore , it shows the possibility of preparing go - based nanocomposites with a reasonably high go content , without sacrificing mechanical performance due to re - aggregation effects .

to complete the duplication of large genomes efficiently , mechanisms have evolved that coordinate dna unwinding with dna synthesis and provide quality control measures prior to cell division .
minichromosome maintenance protein 10 ( mcm10 ) is a conserved component of the eukaryotic replisome that contributes to this process in multiple ways .
mcm10 promotes the initiation of dna replication through direct interactions with the cell division cycle 45 ( cdc45 ) - minichromosome maintenance complex proteins 2 - 7 ( mcm2 - 7 ) - go - ichi - ni - san gins complex proteins , as well as single - and double - stranded dna .
after origin firing , mcm10 controls replication fork stability to support elongation , primarily facilitating okazaki fragment synthesis through recruitment of dna polymerase - alpha and proliferating cell nuclear antigen .
based on its multivalent properties , mcm10 serves as an essential scaffold to promote dna replication and guard against replication stress .
under pathological conditions , mcm10 is often dysregulated .
genetic amplification and / or overexpression of mcm10 are common in cancer , and can serve as a strong prognostic marker of poor survival .
these findings are compatible with a heightened requirement for mcm10 in transformed cells to overcome limitations for dna replication dictated by altered cell cycle control .
in this review , we highlight advances in our understanding of when , where and how mcm10 functions within the replisome to protect against barriers that cause incomplete replication .
cmg helicase dna replication genome stability mcm10 origin activation replication initiation replication elongation 1 .
efficient replication of large eukaryotic genomes at a speed of 1.5 kb per minute , it would take approximately 60 days to duplicate one copy of the human genome if a single , unidirectional fork replicated each chromosome .
to rapidly generate a complete copy of the genome , replication is initiated from numerous origins distributed across each chromosome where the number of initiation sites appears to be related to genome size [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ] .
in budding yeast , ~ 400 replication origins are activated to copy a genome of ~ 1.2 x 107 bp , whereas the significantly larger human genome contains ~ 5 x 104 origins to duplicate a genome of 3 x 109 bp [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ] .
importantly , the number of origins licensed for replication initiation exceeds the number utilized during a normal s - phase [ 8,9,10 ] .
these unfired or " dormant " origins serve as backup sites for initiation in the event of replication stress to ensure that dna replication can be completed [ 11,12 ] .
interestingly , the average distance between replication origins is only moderately increased in humans in comparison to yeast , as both are in the range of 30 - 60 kb [ 6,13,14,15,16 ] .
however , the maximum region replicated by a single origin , or replicon , in humans ( up to ~ 5 mb ) is orders of magnitude larger than in yeast ( up to 60 kb ) [ 6,13,14,15,16 ] .
therefore , different challenges exist in lower and higher eukaryotes to warrant replication fidelity and maintain genome integrity .
in all eukaryotes , replication begins with the loading of the catalytic core of the replicative helicase , which is composed of the minichromosome maintenance complex proteins 2 - 7 ( mcm2 - 7 ) .
unlike in eukaryotic viruses , helicase loading and activation are temporally separated into two distinct stages .
the first step , origin licensing , occurs via loading of mcm2 - 7 double hexamers onto double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) [ 17,18,19,20 ] .
this is achieved during late mitosis and g1 - phase through the coordinated action of the origin recognition complex ( orc ) , cell division cycle 6 protein ( cdc6 ) , and cdc10 - dependent transcript 1 ( cdt1 ) to complete assembly of the pre - replication complex ( pre - rc ) [ 19,20,21,22 ] .
once a sufficiently high number of replication origins have been licensed [ 23 ] , cells prohibit formation of additional pre - rcs and commit to the second stage of dna replication , origin firing and dna synthesis [ 18,24,25,26 ] .
to this end , the helicase co - factors cell division cycle 45 ( cdc45 ) and go - ichi - ni - san ( gins ) are recruited to chromatin [ 18,24,25,26,27,28 ] .
finally , to initiate dna synthesis , cdc45 - mcm2 - 7 - gins ( cmg ) helicase dimers are activated and physically separate to proceed in a bidirectional manner [ 18,24,25,26 ] .
minichromosome maintenance protein 10 ( mcm10 ) participates in this activation process and remains physically attached to the mcm2 - 7 complex throughout dna replication [ 29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37 ] .
in this review , we focus on mcm10 and how it ensures timely and accurate completion of dna replication .
2. discovery and biochemical characterization of mcm10 mcm10 is an evolutionarily conserved component of the eukaryotic replication machinery [ 38,39 ] .
the mcm10 gene was identified in two independent genetic screens in saccharomyces cerevisiae .
initially uncovered over 30 years ago as a temperature sensitive allele of dna43 defective in both entry and completion of s - phase [ 40,41 ] , a second screen revealed additional mcm10 / dna43 mutants that were unable to maintain minichromosomes [ 42,43 ] .
investigations in many eukaryotic model organisms including fission yeast ( schizosaccharomyces pombe ) , nematodes ( caenorhabditis elegans ) , fruit flies ( drosophila melanogaster ) , frogs ( xenopus laevis ) , zebrafish ( danio rerio ) , mice ( mus musculus ) , and humans ( homo sapiens ) have revealed mcm10 homologs [ 31,44,45,46,47 ] .
much of the core replication machinery , including mcm10 , is also conserved in plants [ 48 ] .
curiously , drosophila but not human mcm10 was able to functionally complement a mcm10 mutant in budding yeast [ 35,45,46 ] .
these observations imply that despite its conserved structure and role in dna replication , it is important to determine organism specific details of mcm10 function .
finally , mcm10 homologs have not been found in bacteria or archaea , showing that mcm10 is unique within eukaryotic genomes [ 38,39,49,50,51 ] .
despite the lack of catalytic domains indicative of enzymatic function , mcm10 associates with replication origins , facilitates their activation and becomes part of the replisome [ 30,35,37,52,53,54 ] .
several studies have identified structural motifs in mcm10 that associate with linear single - stranded ( ss - ) and dsdna , as well as more complex topological structures [ 33,51,55,56,57 ] .
furthermore , distinct regions direct interactions between mcm10 and several replication factors , including the mcm2 - 7 complex [ 32,34,43,45,58,59,60 ] , cdc45 [ 45,55,61 ] , dna polymerase alpha ( pol - alpha ) [ 30,57,62,63,64,65 ] , orc [ 45,46,58,66 ] , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) [ 67 ] , chromosome transmission fidelity 4 ( ctf4 ) [ 65,68 ] and recq like helicase 4 ( recql4 ) [ 69 ] .
these data support a model in which mcm10 coordinates helicase activity with dna synthesis through interactions with different protein complexes at the replication fork [ 39,50,51 ] .
below , we review the current understanding of mcm10 's functional domains that facilitate these interactions .
biochemical analyses and sequence alignment of mcm10 homologs have revealed three major structural regions .
referred to as the n - terminal ( ntd ) , internal ( id ) and c - terminal domains ( ctd ) , each contains distinct functional regions involved in dna binding and / or protein - protein contacts ( figure 1 ) [ 38,39,51 ] .
the id is the most highly conserved region of mcm10 and mediates both protein - dna and protein - protein interactions ( figure 1 and figure 2 ) .
dna binding occurs via two motifs : a canonical oligonucleotide / oligosaccharide - binding fold ( ob - fold ) and a single ccch zinc - finger ( znf1 ) ( figure 1 and figure 2 ) [ 57,62,63,70 ] .
unlike other proteins carrying these motifs , the mcm10 ob - fold and znf1 are in a unique configuration and form a continuous interaction surface [ 57 ] , capable of binding ss - and dsdna [ 33,51,57,70,71,72 ] .
mcm10 does not have a preference for particular dna sequences or topological structures , but its affinity for ssdna is higher than for dsdna [ 33,51,55,56,57 ] .
in addition to dna binding motifs , the id contains specific sites that contact pol - alpha , pcna and mcm2 - 7 ( figure 1 ) [ 30,43,45,46,51,57,58,59,60,63,67,70 ] .
association with pol - alpha occurs via a hydrophobic patch termed the heat shock protein 10 ( hsp10 ) - like domain [ 30,57,63,70 ] , whereas pcna binds to a noncanonical pcna interacting peptide ( pip ) box , qxxm / i / lxxf / yf / y ( figure 2 ) [ 39,67 ] .
notably , the putative pcna interaction motif in higher eukaryotes bears close resemblance to the qlslf consensus binding site for the prokaryotic beta - clamp , which functions similarly to pcna in promoting polymerase processivity [ 39,50,73 ] .
both the hsp10 - like domain and pip box lie within the ob - fold on perpendicular beta - strands ( figure 1 ) , suggesting that pol - alpha and pcna compete with each other .
however , pol - alpha can be easily displaced by ssdna [ 57 ] .
the ntd is common among mcm10 proteins from yeast to humans , but is not essential and less well conserved than the central id ( figure 1 and figure 3 ) [ 74,75 ] .
functionally , the ntd contributes to self - oligomerization and partner protein interaction [ 39,50 ] .
homocomplex formation of xenopus and human mcm10 clearly depends on the ntd [ 55,72,75 ] .
a conserved coiled - coil ( cc ) domain within the ntd mediates dimer and trimer formation of purified xenopus mcm10 ( figure 1 and figure 3 ) [ 51,75 ] .
human mcm10 was proposed to form trimers or a hexameric ring , with the latter reinforced by electron microscopy reconstructions and model fitting based on the archaeal mcm helicase and simian virus 40 large t - antigen [ 55,72 ] .
however , the electron density map of the high - resolution crystal structure of xenopus mcm10 is not fully compatible with ring formation , leaving the true nature of the mcm10 homo - oligomer open for further exploration [ 38,55,70,72 ] .
furthermore , current data lack insight regarding how a hexameric mcm10 ring would be loaded onto dna .
these discrepancies notwithstanding , oligomerization of mcm10 agrees with the characterization of s. cerevisiae mcm10 complexes that associate with dna [ 30,56 ] .
the stoichiometry of dna binding by mcm10 is 1:1 on dsdna , but 3:1 on ssdna [ 56 ] , suggesting that oligomerization may be triggered by dna unwinding .
mcm10 oligomerization would thus present an elegant solution to the problem that ssdna evicts pol - alpha from the ob - fold [ 57 ] .
finally , the ntd promotes resistance to replication stress , as failure to oligomerize dramatically increases sensitivity to hydroxyurea in checkpoint deficient cells [ 74 ] .
independent of its role in oligomerization , the first 150 amino acids of the ntd interact with mitosis entry checkpoint 3 ( mec3 ) , a component of the yeast radiation sensitive 9 ( rad9 ) , hydroxyurea sensitive 1 ( hus1 ) , radiation sensitive 1 ( rad1 ) checkpoint clamp referred to as 9 - 1 - 1 [ 74 ] .
it appears that mcm10 promotes resistance to uv irradiation in budding yeast through direct binding of the 9 - 1 - 1 clamp , whereby it might stabilize stalled replication forks [ 74 ] .
the mcm10 ctd , although not present in unicellular eukaryotes , is conserved among metazoan species from nematodes to humans ( figure 1 and figure 4 ) .
the ctd contains a winged helix domain ( wh ) and two zinc chelating motifs , a ccch zinc - finger ( znf2 ) and a cccc zinc - ribbon ( znr ) ( figure 1 and figure 4 ) .
znf2 is required for the ctd to bind dna , but the function of the znr has not been clearly defined , although it shares homology with the znrs found in archaeal and vertebrate mcm proteins [ 39,51,55,57,76 ] .
mutation of the znr disrupts archaeal double hexamer formation , whereas alteration of the znr in budding yeast mcms reduces viability [ 76,77,78,79 ] , suggesting that it may mediate protein - protein interactions important for proper helicase function .
recent analysis of drosophila mcm10 demonstrated that the ctd directs interaction with heterochromatin protein 1a ( hp1a ) in vitro , a finding that is further supported by in situ proximity ligation [ 80 ] .
this interaction is deemed important for cell cycle regulation and cell differentiation [ 80 ] .
furthermore , the ctd of human mcm10 is necessary for nuclear localization although a bona fide nls has not been defined [ 81 ] .
interestingly , the budding yeast c - terminus carries two bipartite nuclear localization signals ( nlss ) that are each sufficient for directing mcm10 to the nucleus ( figure 1 ) , however , a homologous region is not present in metazoan mcm10 [ 82 ] .
recent work from two independent groups has also mapped the major mcm2 - 7 interaction surface , via mcm2 and mcm6 , to a portion of mcm10 's c - terminus in budding yeast .
again , this particular region is not conserved in higher eukaryotes [ 32,34 ] .
functionally , the ctd is similar to the id , specifically in mediating interactions with dna and pol - alpha [ 51,55,62 ] .
the dna binding surfaces in the id and ctd can be utilized simultaneously , as xenopus mcm10 binds in vitro with approximately 100 - fold higher affinity than either domain individually [ 51 ] .
finally , dna binding of the id and ctd can be modulated by acetylation and this will be further discussed below [ 62 ] .
3. the multifaceted regulation of mcm10 function mcm10 is regulated via changes in expression , localization and post - translational modification .
the e2f / rb ( retinoblastoma ) pathway , which is central to normal cell cycle control and proliferation , regulates transcription of mcm10 in human hct116 cells [ 84,85 ] .
furthermore , an essential e3 ubiquitin ligase , retinoblastoma binding protein 6 ( rbbp6 ) , ubiquitinates and destabilizes the transcriptional repressor zinc finger and btb domain - containing protein 38 ( zbtb38 ) thereby relieving inhibition of mcm10 transcription [ 86,87 ] .
interestingly , rbbp6 ( also known as pact or p2p - r ) interacts with the critical cell cycle regulators rb and p53 to modulate cell cycle progression [ 86,88,89 ] .
furthermore , the zinc - finger transcription factor gata - binding factor 6 ( gata6 ) promotes mcm10 expression in highly proliferative mouse follicle progenitor cells by stimulating ectodysplasin - a receptor - associated adapter protein ( edaradd ) and nf - kappab signaling [ 90 ] .
mcm10 expression levels are also controlled by micrornas , such as mir - 215 , which directly regulates mcm as well as other cell cycle genes , including mcm3 and cdc25a [ 91,92 ] .
this suggests coordinated suppression of genes that promote proliferation .
finally , mcm10 expression is often increased in rapidly proliferating tumor cells ( discussed in more detail below ) , pointing to a potential role in not just facilitating but actively driving cell cycle progression .
in addition to controlling mcm10 expression , several post - translational modifications regulate mcm10 turnover or modulate the activity of functional domains .
cellular levels of human mcm10 increase as the cell cycle approaches the g1 / s boundary and decrease in late g2 / m - phase [ 93,94,95 ] .
in hela and u2os cell lines , mcm10 depletion during mitosis is proteasome dependent [ 93,95 ] .
the oscillation of mcm10 levels is similar to other cell cycle regulators whose degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway [ 96 ] .
mcm10 is a substrate of the cullin 4 ( cul4 ) , damaged dna binding 1 ( ddb1 ) , viral protein r binding protein ( vprbp ) e3 ubiquitin ligase ( table 1 ) [ 81,95,97,98 ] .
these observations are consistent with the role of the cullin - ring e3 ligase family in regulating multiple cell cycle and dna replication related proteins [ 99 ] .
although mcm10 contains substrate recognition motifs for the anaphase promoting complex / cyclosome ( apc / c ) , it is not an apc / c target [ 95 ] .
the described degradation mechanism is also activated in response to high doses of uv - radiation , likely to stall dna replication instantaneously [ 81 ] .
furthermore , in response to human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( hiv - 1 ) infection , viral protein r ( vpr ) enhances the proteasomal degradation of endogenous cul4 - ddb1 - vprbp substrates , including mcm10 , which causes g2 / m arrest [ 98 ] .
lastly , ubiquitination of mcm10 has also been observed in budding yeast , although this modification does not appear to drive protein degradation , but rather regulates mcm10 function during s - phase ( table 1 ) [ 67,100 ] .
besides ubiquitination , phosphorylation of mcm10 is also important for its functional regulation .
in hela cells , the phosphorylation of mcm10 is proposed to facilitate release from chromatin [ 93 ] .
subsequently , several high - throughput proteomics studies have identified a large number of putative phosphorylation sites on mcm10 [ 101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112 ] .
to date there has not been additional validation or functional characterization of these phosphorylation sites , although 23 have been reported in multiple datasets ( table 1 ) [ 101 ] .
interestingly , xenopus mcm10 is phosphorylated on various s - phase cyclin - dependent kinase ( s - cdk ) target sites [ 113 ]. of the seven sites identified ( table 1 ) , only serine 630 is conserved in other metazoa [ 113 ] .
recombinant xenopus s630a mutant protein that cannot be phosphorylated supports chromatin loading and bulk dna synthesis but significantly reduces replisome stability in vitro [ 113 ] .
decreased fork stability also leads to increased dna damage following treatment with the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin [ 113 ] .
the homologous site in human mcm10 ( s644 ) has been reported in the human phosphoproteome database , and warrants further investigation [ 101,102,106 ] .
future studies will be important to clarify our understanding of how phosphorylation may regulate mcm10 in different biological systems .
in addition to mcm10 regulation by phosphorylation and ubiquitination , acetylation modulates the dna binding properties of human mcm10 .
in vitro assays and in vivo analyses ( in hct116 cells ) provide evidence that the id and ctd of mcm10 can be acetylated by the p300 acetyltransferase at more than 20 lysines ( table 1 ) [ 62 ] .
sirtuin 1 ( sirt1 ) , a member of the sirtuin family of deacetylases and homolog of yeast sir2 , can deacetylate a subset of these residues [ 62 ] .
intriguingly , acetylation increases the dna binding affinity of the id but decreases affinity of the ctd in vitro [ 62 ] .
furthermore , the depletion of sirt1 leads to increased levels of total and chromatin - bound mcm10 , disruption of the replication program , dna damage and g2 / m arrest [ 62 ] .
taken together , these observations suggest that acetylation of mcm10 might regulate protein levels and dynamically controls the overlapping functions of the id and ctd in dna association or protein binding .
4. mcm10 is a central player in multiple steps of dna replication mcm10 is an essential regulator of dna replication initiation .
early evidence for this came from 2d gel analyses in yeast that reported decreased firing of two specific origins ( ori1 and ori121 ) in temperature - sensitive mcm10 - 1 mutants [ 43 ] .
in s. cerevisiae , mcm10 is loaded onto chromatin in g1 and remains bound during s - phase [ 30 ] .
one clear pre - requisite for mcm10 chromatin binding is pre - rc assembly , as association of mcm10 with origins of replication is dependent on the mcm2 - 7 complex [ 29,30,31,32,33,34 ] .
studies utilizing a mcm10 - degron system found that depletion during g1 - phase prevented a significant number of cells from initiating dna synthesis [ 30,114,115 ] .
building on these reports , the timing and mechanism of mcm10 's role in replication initiation remains a topic of active research .
at licensed origins , dna replication is initiated through a multi - step process .
helicase activation requires that the dbf4 - dependent kinase cdc7 ( ddk ) and s - cdk phosphorylate several targets [ 116,117,118,119 ] .
ddk - dependent phosphorylation of mcm2 - 7 initiates recruitment of synthetically lethal with dpb11 3 ( sld3 ) , its binding partner sld7 , and the helicase co - activator cdc45 [ 116,117,120,121 ] .
similarly , s - cdk - dependent phosphorylation of sld2 and sld3 initiates recruitment of helicase co - activator gins and the pre - loading complex ( pre - lc ) , consisting of sld2 , dna polymerase b ii 11 ( dpb11 ) and dna polymerase epsilon ( pol - epsilon ) [ 116,117,119,120,121 ] .
next , the origin is unwound to allow recruitment of pol - alpha / primase to ssdna [ 52,122,123 ] and as the cmg helicase progresses , it generates larger ssdna regions that are protected by the replication protein a ( rpa ) complex [ 24,124 ] .
dna synthesis begins with the production of rna - dna primers by pol - alpha / primase on both strands [ 122,123 ] and requires frequent re - priming for okazaki fragment synthesis [ 18,125,126 ] .
during replication elongation , these primers are extended on the leading strand by pol - epsilon and on the lagging strand by dna polymerase delta ( pol - delta ) [ 24,122,123 ] , in association with pcna , the trimeric replication clamp [ 24,127 ] .
the process of replication requires mcm10 at several steps , and three major functions have been proposed .
first , mcm10 is necessary for recruitment of gins and cdc45 to complete assembly of the cmg helicase .
second , following cmg assembly mcm10 is needed for activation of the helicase .
third , after origin unwinding mcm10 is required for polymerase loading to initiate dna synthesis .
the following paragraphs will evaluate these roles in more detail .
5. mcm10 promotes assembly of the replicative helicase investigations of mcm10 's role in cmg complex assembly have largely focused on stable association of cdc45 .
early studies in xenopus egg extracts reported that cdc45 binding was significantly reduced following depletion of mcm10 [ 31 ] .
a similar observation was made in fission yeast , as mcm10 degradation in vivo resulted in the loss of nuclear cdc45 following detergent wash [ 61,128 ] .
in agreement , stable association of the cmg complex was reduced and chromatin loading of cdc45 and sld5 were not detected following small interfering rna ( sirna ) knockdown of mcm10 , recql4 or ctf4 in hela cells [ 129 ] .
these data imply that mcm10 might be integral for cmg assembly .
however , there is evidence that loss of mcm10 does not abolish cdc45 recruitment , as cmg formation in s - phase eventually recovers to wild type levels [ 33,61,128 ] .
taken together , these studies support the hypothesis that mcm10 deficiency delays recruitment and / or decreases stability of cdc45 interaction with the replicative helicase .
however , there are also several reports consistent with a model in which mcm10 is dispensable for cmg assembly .
two independent groups utilizing inducible mcm10 degradation in budding yeast found no effect on chromatin association of cdc45 [ 30,115 ] .
these data are in agreement with the finding that depletion of mcm10 from purified s - phase extracts does not reduce cdc45 recruitment [ 130 ] .
this also holds true in a reconstituted system with 16 purified yeast replication factors [ 131 ] .
delineating the timing of mcm10 loading with respect to ddk and s - cdk activities has provided additional insights regarding mcm10 's placement in cmg assembly .
after formation of the pre - rc , origin activation requires ddk phosphorylation of mcm2 - 7 , followed by s - cdk phosphorylation of sld2 and sld3 [ 130,132,133 ] .
experiments using whole cell extracts from yeast reported that the action of ddk followed by s - cdk was essential for mcm10 recruitment , as mcm10 was undetectable when s - cdk treatment was performed first [ 130 ] .
however , in a minimal in vitro system with purified proteins , cmg formation and dna synthesis occurred regardless of which kinase was added to the reaction first [ 131 ] .
it seems possible that s - cdk targets may become rapidly dephosphorylated by phosphatases present in the yeast extracts used by heller and colleagues [ 130 ] , and that therefore s - cdk activity is required immediately before mcm10 recruitment .
in fact , there is supporting evidence for this notion [ 131,134 ] .
overall , these studies agree that robust mcm10 recruitment occurs following kinase activated cmg assembly .
however , they are not in agreement with experiments in fission yeast that reported mcm10 - dependent stimulation of ddk activity , thereby placing mcm10 at the replisome early in cmg assembly [ 60 ] .
these latter findings are consistent with recent results in budding yeast in which cdc45 recruitment to dna is facilitated by ddk - dependent ( via phospho - sld3 ) and ddk - independent ( via mcm10 ) mechanisms [ 33 ] .
a possible solution to this apparent discrepancy is presented below .
studies by the diffley and lou laboratories investigating mcm10 recruitment to the cmg complex may provide the best compromise to reconcile the conflicting data discussed above [ 32,34 ] .
both reports highlight the requirement for the c - terminal ~ 100 amino acids of yeast mcm10 to directly bind to mcm2 - 7 double hexamers [ 32,34 ] .
this interaction permits both a low affinity " g1 - phase - like " and high affinity " s - phase - like " binding of mcm10 to mcm2 - 7 .
the " g1 - phase - like " binding seems consistent with mass spectrometry analysis of replication reactions that detect mcm10 on dna independently of ddk activity , but at levels 10 - 100 fold lower than other firing factors [ 134 ] .
therefore , mcm10 may initially associate with the pre - rc prior to cdc45 addition , and then bind more robustly at later stages of cmg assembly ( figure 5 ) [ 32,34 ] .
6. activation of the cmg helicase relies on mcm10 replication initiation begins with origin unwinding to generate ssdna that is encircled by one cmg helicase complex , which then translocates in 3 ' to 5 ' direction [ 18,24,39,135 ] .
early studies found that depletion of mcm10 from xenopus extracts resulted in the inability to unwind a double stranded plasmid and recruit rpa to chromatin [ 31 ] .
a similar deficiency in rpa recruitment was demonstrated following depletion of mcm10 in budding and fission yeast [ 33,114,115,136 ] .
as rpa is the major ssdna - binding complex in eukaryotes , this provides strong evidence that dsdna unwinding is impaired in the absence of mcm10 .
this is generally in agreement with the notion that mcm10 is one of the key origin " firing factors " identified via mass spectrometry in yeast replication complexes [ 134 ] .
importantly , in a reconstituted budding yeast replication system , mcm10 both promotes rpa loading and is essential for dna synthesis [ 131 ] .
two independent but not mutually exclusive mechanisms exist for mcm10 in cmg activation .
first , mcm10 may actively promote remodeling of the replicative helicase from a double to a single cmg complex .
observations that mcm10 stimulates ddk activity prior to cmg assembly ( discussed above ) and recruits replisome components required for initiation , such as the human sld2 homolog recql4 support this model [ 69,129,137,138,139 ] .
second , mcm10 may stabilize ssdna following dna unwinding prior to rpa association .
this idea is strengthened by numerous experimental observations .
mcm10 preferentially binds to ssdna rather than dsdna [ 51,55,56,57,71 ] , and the disruption of znf1 in fission yeast impaired rpa recruitment to replication origins [ 136 ] .
furthermore , analysis of a s. cerevisiae mcm10 mutant defective in dna binding showed significantly decreased rpa association at specific origin sequences , and a severe decline in viability [ 71 ] .
moreover , viability of this mcm10 mutant could not be enhanced by a mcm5 mutation ( mcm5bob - 1 ) that bypasses the requirement for ddk - dependent phosphorylation of mcm2 [ 140,141,142 ] .
these observations strongly support a critical role for mcm10 in stabilizing the replisome during origin firing through binding of newly exposed ssdna , rather than a stimulatory function in ddk - dependent mcm2 phosphorylation .
in this model , mcm10 holds on to ssdna first , but is later evicted by rpa , which protects longer regions of ssdna behind the progressing helicase .
this is also consistent with the fact that that rpa has an apparent 40 - fold higher affinity for ssdna than mcm10 [ 143 ] .
this mechanism would then allow mcm10 to remain anchored to the mcm2 - 7 complex and travel with the replisome [ 30,35,37,52,53 ] .
7. mcm10 - dependent polymerase loading unperturbed dna synthesis in eukaryotes relies on three dna polymerases .
the recruitment of pol - epsilon occurs prior to dna unwinding , via interactions with the gins complex , and is independent of mcm10 [ 130,144,145 ] .
however , mcm10 is an important player in polymerase loading during replication elongation .
experiments in budding and fission yeast , xenopus egg extracts and human cells all demonstrated that mcm10 facilitates chromatin loading of pol - alpha to initiate okazaki fragment synthesis [ 18,30,64,65,130,146 ] .
mcm10 likely works in concert with the cohesion factor ctf4 , which forms a homo - trimeric hub [ 29,65 ] , fitting with the fact that mcm10 forms a homo - trimeric scaffold [ 51,55,75 ] .
it should be noted , however , that budding yeast ctf4 is dispensable for dna replication in vivo and in vitro [ 131,147 ] , strongly arguing that in s. cerevisiae mcm10 is the critical connector between dna polymerization and helicase activities [ 30 ] .
furthermore , xenopus mcm10 interacts with acidic nucleoplasmic dna - binding protein 1 ( and - 1 )/ ctf4 to initiate dna replication [ 65 ] .
in human cells , recql4 promotes interactions between mcm10 and and - 1 / ctf4 consequently facilitating efficient dna replication [ 129,137,138 ] .
following pol - alpha loading , mcm10 directly interacts with the replication clamp pcna .
disruption of this interaction via a single amino acid substitution within mcm10 's pip - motif causes lethality in s. cerevisiae [ 67 ] .
this protein - protein interaction is dependent on diubiquitination of mcm10 , which is proposed to make the internally located pip motif accessible for pcna binding [ 67 ] .
interestingly , diubiquitination occurs during g1 / s - phase and disrupts mcm10 's interaction with pol - alpha [ 67 ] .
therefore , ubiquitination of mcm10 following primer synthesis by pol - alpha could function to recruit pcna and facilitate loading onto primed dna [ 39,50,67 ] .
interestingly , recruitment of the lagging strand polymerase pol - delta was reduced following mcm10 depletion in budding yeast [ 130 ] .
one explanation of these data is that without mcm10 - dependent generation of ssdna regions and recruitment of pol - alpha to initiate dna synthesis , pcna loading is decreased .
impaired pcna recruitment could diminish pol - delta association at the replication fork. whether the mcm10 - pcna interaction occurs in higher eukaryotes is currently unknown , although such an observation would strongly support a conserved role of mcm10 in elongation. of note , it was recently proposed that the pip boxes identified in several pcna interacting proteins may belong to a broader class of " pip - like " motifs that have the ability to bind multiple target proteins [ 148 ] .
in line with this idea , the yeast mcm10 pip motif is also important for direct binding to the mec3 subunit of the 9 - 1 - 1 checkpoint clamp [ 74 ] .
thus , mcm10 's direct interaction network that stabilizes the fork during normal dna synthesis and in response to replication stress could extend beyond factors currently identified .
8. replication fork progression and stability relies on mcm10 loss of mcm10 causes replication stress and increased dependence on pathways that maintain genome integrity [ 149,150,151,152,153 ] .
genetic analyses in yeast have demonstrated that mcm10 mutants rely on the checkpoint signaling factors mitosis entry checkpoint 1 ( mec1 ) and radiation sensitive 53 ( rad53 ) that are activated in response to rpa coated ssdna [ 39,50,66,149,150 ] .
under conditions of high replication stress , rad53 hyperactivation blocks s - phase progression [ 154,155 ] .
however , moderate chronic replication stress in mcm10 - 1 mutants under semi - permissive conditions only elicits low - level rad53 activity and allows the cell cycle to advance .
under these circumstances , underreplicated dna eventually triggers the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint ( sac ) [ 156,157 ] .
to evade sac activation when replication stress is tolerable , these cells rely on the e3 small ubiquitin - like modifier ( sumo ) ligase methyl methanesulfonate sensitivity 21 ( mms21 ) and the sumo - targeted ubiquitin ligase complex synthetic lethal of unknown ( x ) function 5 / 8 ( slx5 / 8 ) in order to progress through m - phase [ 157 ] .
overall , these studies suggest that moderate mcm10 deficiency in budding yeast primarily causes defects in replication fork progression .
indeed , experiments using mcm10 - 1 mutants found that the dna synthesis and growth defects at non - permissive temperatures could be alleviated by mutations in mcm2 [ 39,43,50,59,63,67,150 ] .
in addition , loss - of - function mutations in mcm5 and mcm7 also suppressed mcm10 - 1 mutant phenotypes [ 59 ] .
the simplest interpretation of these data is that mcm mutations disrupt helicase activity , slow fork progression and reduce ssdna accumulation , thus suppressing checkpoint activation in mcm10 mutants .
in metazoa , mcm10 is also important for replication fork progression and stability .
two independent sirna screens identified mcm10 as a potent suppressor of chromosome breaks and incomplete replication [ 6,152,153 ] .
knockdown experiments in hela cells revealed defects in dna synthesis that resulted in late s - phase arrest , suggesting that cells accumulate significant damage if replication proceeds with reduced mcm10 levels [ 158,159,160 ] .
recently , investigators have employed the dna fiber technique to assess replication dynamics and measure inter - origin distance ( iod ) as well as fork velocity .
interestingly , mcm10 depletion decreased fork velocity in u2os , but not in hct116 cells , during unperturbed cell cycle conditions [ 62,87 ] .
one explanation is that the intrinsically faster rate of synthesis in u2os cells causes an increased requirement for mcm10 to sustain fork speed .
surprisingly , both studies found that the iod was decreased following sirna knockdown of mcm10 , indicative of an actual increase in origin firing [ 62,87 ] .
moreover , a recent study using xenopus egg extracts also argued that mcm10 depletion primarily affected elongation and not replication initiation [ 113,161 ] .
in these studies , rpa loading occurred in the absence of more than 99 % of mcm10 and the efficiency of bulk dna synthesis only decreased by 20 % [ 113 ] .
consistent with a role in elongation , mcm10 depletion in this system impaired replisome stability , as levels of pcna , rpa , and several cmg components showed drastically reduced chromatin association [ 113,161 ] .
loss of replisome stability caused a markedly increased sensitivity to camptothecin and resulted in fork collapse and dsbs [ 113 ] .
several possibilities exist to reconcile these data with those that argue for an essential role in replication initiation .
for example , origin firing may require very small amounts of mcm10 .
in this scenario , even when mcm10 is undetectable by western blot enough may remain on chromatin to facilitate initiation .
alternatively , dormant or backup origins , the majority of which are not activated during a normal cell cycle , could bypass the requirement for mcm10 .
the ability of these origins to be activated via an alternative mechanism would support a role solely in replication elongation for mcm10 .
it is our opinion that this is unlikely , based on the in vitro reconstruction of origin firing with purified proteins [ 131 ] , but the issue is certainly a top priority to be resolved .
9. emerging connections between mcm10 and cancer development several studies have found mcm10 expression to be significantly upregulated in cancer cells [ 92,162,163,164,165,166 ] .
a comparison of mcm10 mrna levels in normal and tumor samples on the broad institute firebrowse gene expression viewer consistently shows higher abundance in cancer samples ( www.firebrowse.org ) .
oncogene driven overexpression of mcm10 was reported in a collection of neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines , as well as in ewing 's sarcoma tumor cells [ 162,163 ] .
interestingly , mcm10 overexpression increases with advancing tumor stage in cervical cancer [ 165 ] and correlates with the transition from confined to metastasized renal clear cell carcinoma [ 92 ] .
additional cell cycle related transcripts , including other mcm genes , are also upregulated in these cancer samples [ 92,162,163,164,165,166 ] , suggesting that enhanced mcm10 production may simply coincide with increased dna synthesis .
contrary to this idea , mcm10 has been proposed to be part of a group of high - priority genes that promote cell cycle related processes in cancer cells [ 167 ] .
moreover , a recent analysis of urothelial carcinomas found that the level of mcm10 expression , but not of other mcm genes , was a highly significant predictor of both disease - free and metastasis - free survival [ 166 ] .
in fact , increases in mcm10 expression could be detected prior to histological changes [ 166 ] .
since high gene expression and protein production strongly correlates with negative outcomes , the detection of mcm10 protein levels could be a valuable early indicator of progression in urothelial carcinomas [ 166 ] .
future investigations should determine whether early detection of increased mcm10 production has prognostic value in other cancer types .
in addition to transcriptional changes , analyses of cancer genomes have identified chromosomal amplifications , deletions and mutations in mcm10 [ 39,50,168,169,170 ] .
current data indicate that over half (~ 54 %) of the genetic alterations are amplifications , whereas ~ 35 % are mutations and only ~ 11 % are deletions [ 168,169 ] .
the majority of mutations identified to date are missense mutations ( 93 %) , with the remainder roughly split between splicing ( 3.7 %) and nonsense mutations ( 3.2 %) [ 168,169 ] .
notably , a higher number of mcm10 alterations have been identified in breast cancer samples than in other tumor types ( figure 6 ) [ 168,169 ] .
these alterations are generally mutually exclusive with changes in the breast cancer ( brca ) susceptibility genes brca1 , brca2 or partner and localizer of brca2 ( palb2 ) ( figure 6 ) [ 168,169 ] .
this trend was maintained in a similar analysis of the cancer cell line encyclopedia dataset ( figure 6 ) [ 168,169,171 ] .
these data suggest that alterations in two or more of these genes are not well tolerated .
experiments evaluating this hypothesis could prove valuable in the treatment of brca associated tumors .
taken together , these data clearly show that mcm10 is altered in cancer genomes .
what remains to be determined is whether these changes are causative or a consequence of oncogenesis , or whether mutations may simply be a byproduct of decreased genome stability seen in cancer cells .
given the elevated mcm10 levels [ 92,162,163,165,166 ] and frequency of genomic amplifications observed in cancer cells [ 168,169 ] , it seems reasonable to propose that during oncogenesis cells rely on increased mcm10 levels to ameliorate replication stress and drive cell cycle progression .
future evaluations of this hypothesis will be crucial to understanding mcm10 's contribution to cancer development .
however , this idea does not address the impact of gene deletions or loss - of - function mutations , such as truncations or amino acids substitutions that might disrupt important functional domains .
based on experimental observations , it seems possible that these genetic alterations could increase replication stress and dna damage .
thus , these lesions likely occur late in oncogenesis after cells have already deactivated pathways that induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to sources of genome instability .
extending data from yeast , it will be interesting to understand whether there is an increased requirement for ring finger protein 4 ( rnf4 ) , the human homolog of yeast slx5 / slx8 , [ 157,172 ] , in order to promote survival under moderate levels of replication stress .
10. conclusions in the several decades since mcm10 was first discovered , significant progress has been made in understanding its role in eukaryotic dna replication .
nevertheless , active research across many laboratories continues to provide mechanistic insights into how mcm10 stimulates replication initiation and promotes fork progression during elongation .
these important cellular functions , when compromised , contribute to human disease .
based on recent studies , future investigations into mcm10 's relationship with cancer development and progression could lead to discoveries with significant prognostic and even therapeutic value .

2004 25 1605 1612 10.1002 / jcc.20084 15264254 figure 1 the domain structure of minichromosome maintenance protein 10 ( mcm10 ) .
full - length mcm10 is depicted for homo sapiens ( 875 amino acids ( aa )) and saccharomyces cerevisiae ( 571 aa ) .
mcm10 functional domains and the amino acid regions they span depicted .
the n - terminal domain ( ntd ) contains a coiled - coil ( cc , orange ) motif responsible for mcm10 self - interaction .
the internal domain ( id ) mediates mcm10 interactions with proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) and dna polymerase - alpha ( pol - alpha ) through a pcna - interacting peptide ( pip ) box ( red ) and hsp10 - like domain ( purple ) , respectively .
these motifs reside in the oligonucleotide / oligosaccharide binding ( ob ) - fold ( light gray ) .
the ob - fold along with zinc - finger motif 1 ( znf1 , green ) serve as a dna - binding domain .
the c - terminal domain ( ctd ) is specific to metazoa and interacts with dna primarily through znf2 ( green ) .
the ctd also includes the zinc ribbon ( znr , blue ) and winged helix motif ( wh , dark gray ) ; however their functions are currently unknown .
a bipartite nuclear localization sequence ( nls ) has been identified in s. cerevisiae .
figure 2 evolutionary conservation of functional domains in the mcm10 id .
( a - d ) comparison of the amino acid sequences from homo sapiens , mus musculus , danio rerio , xenopus laevis , drosophila melanogaster , caenorhabditis elegans , saccharomyces pombe and saccharomyces cerevisiae of the ob - fold ( a ) , pip box ( b ) , hsp10 - like ( c ) and zinc - finger 1 ( d ) domains .
the full sequence alignment for the ob - fold is not shown due to size constraints , but can be found in warren et al. , [ 70 ] .
the percent conservation (% cons. ) , defined as the percentage of amino acid positions identical ( in red ) or strongly similar ( in blue ) to those of human mcm10 , is listed for each domain sequence .
the total region aligned for each sequence listed in gray .
( e ) the crystal structure of the xenopus mcm10 ( xmcm10 ) ob - fold ( gray ) , pip box ( red ) , hsp10 - like ( purple ) and zinc - finger 1 ( green ) domains is shown .
the structure was generated using pdb data file 3ebe and the chimera program ( http :// www.cgl.ucsf.edu / chimera ) [ 83 ] .

( a - c ) comparison of the amino acid sequences from h. sapiens , m. musculus , d. rerio , x. laevis , d. melanogaster and c. elegans of the winged helix ( a ) , zinc - finger 2 ( b ) and zinc - ribbon ( c ) .
the percent conservation (% cons. ) , defined as the percentage of amino acid positions identical ( in red ) or strongly similar ( in blue ) to those of human mcm10 , is listed for each domain sequence .
the total region aligned for each sequence listed in gray .
( d ) the crystal structure of the xenopus mcm10 ( xmcm10 ) zinc - finger 2 ( green ) and zinc - ribbon ( blue ) domains is shown .
the structure was generated using pdb data file 2kwq and the chimera program ( http :// www.cgl.ucsf.edu / chimera ) [ 83 ] .
figure 5 model of the association of mcm10 with the replisome in initiation and elongation .
( a ) a mcm2 - 7 double hexamer is loaded onto dsdna and represent a licensed replication origin .
( b ) mcm10 directly interacts with the mcm2 - 7 with low affinity in g1 - phase - like binding prior to cmg assembly .
( c ) high affinity binding of mcm10 to the mcm2 - 7 complex in s - phase like binding takes place with formation of the cmg complex .
( d ) following helicase activation , replication forks progress in opposite directions from each origin .
mcm10 binds and stabilizes ssdna ( right fork ) and is later replaced by rpa .
mcm10 loading of dna polymerase - alpha ( pol - alpha ) ( left fork ) is repeatedly needed to generate rna / dna primers ( black dna regions ) for okazaki fragment synthesis .
processive dna polymerization is executed by dna polymerase - epsilon ( pol - epsilon ) ( extending the blue leading strand ) and dna polymerase - delta ( pol - delta ) ( extending the red lagging strand ) .
figure 6 mcm10 alterations in human cancer samples and exclusivity with brca - associated mutations .
( a ) bar graph showing the number and class of alterations including amplifications ( red ) , deletions ( blue ) , mutations ( green ) or a combination ( gray ) of mcm10 identified in different cancer types by multiple groups .
the tissue / cell type and dataset for each column are listed on the x - axis .
only datasets with 5 or more mcm10 alterations are shown .
( b,c ) plots showing the overlap of genetic alterations including amplifications ( red ) , deletions ( blue ) and mutations ( green ) in mcm10 or breast cancer ( brca ) associated genes ( brca1 , brca2 , partner and localizer of brca2 ( palb2 )) in the breast invasive carcinoma dataset ( the cancer genome atlas [ tcga ]) ( b ) or the cancer cell line encyclopedia ( novartis / broad ) [ 171 ] .

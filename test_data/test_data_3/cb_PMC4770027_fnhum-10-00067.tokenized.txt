oxytocin neuropeptide consciousness self self - other perception in recent years , the study of self - consciousness from neuroscience and psychobiological perspectives has flourished rapidly .
the understanding of the brain areas involved in self - consciousness and the complex intertwining of self - consciousness levels has expanded greatly , and the awareness of neurotransmitter influence on self - consciousness has begun to emerge .
despite this , the neuropeptidergic influences on self - consciousness have been largely ignored however , recent studies of the neuropeptide oxytocin have yielded promising results that further our understanding of the psychobiological foundations of self - consciousness .
here , we argue that the oxytocinergic system plays a role in modulating several levels of self - consciousness , a conclusion that is usually underscored in interpretations of previous studies .
several studies indicate , that the neuropeptide oxytocin plays a central role in social cognition ( heinrichs and domes , 2008 ; heinrichs et al. , 2009 ) .
for example , oxytocin administration sharpens mind - reading skills ( domes et al. , 2007 ) , enhances understanding of other 's perspective ( ditzen et al. , 2009 ) , and modulates evaluation of other 's trustworthiness ( kosfeld et al. , 2005 ) .
the cognition of self and other are closely interrelated and partly share the same brain network .
for example , the medial prefrontal cortex is involved in other 's mental state and personality inference tasks ( mitchell et al. , 2002 , 2004 ) as well as in evaluation of one 's own personality traits ( johnson et al. , 2002 ). of note , oxytocin administration modulates the medial prefrontal cortex activity ( sripada et al. , 2013 ) .
the understanding of others' perspectives and empathic responses also relies on the ability to recognize self - other differences .
oxytocin administration mediates the activation of brain areas , e.g. , the posterior temporal sulcus ( pincus et al. , 2010 ; gordon et al. , 2013 ) , that are involved in mentalizing and processing self - other distinction ( decety and lamm , 2007 ) .
oxytocin is probably involved in both other - and self - related processing .
two fundamental issues regarding the oxytocinergic system and self - consciousness are of specific relevance .
first , oxytocin is synthesized in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus and processed to the posterior pituitary lobe , through axonal projections , for release into peripheral circulation .
in addition , dendrites release oxytocin into extracellular space , from where it diffuses to several distant areas in the brain .
oxytocin receptors have been found in several brain areas , including the periacqueductal gray , putamen , insula , amygdala , nucleus accumbens , and prefrontal cortex ( sofroniew , 1983 ; tribollet et al. , 1992 ; meyer - lindenberg et al. , 2011 ). of note , oxytocin diffuses from evolutionarily ancient areas primarily involved in arousal states and emotion expression to more recent distal brain areas involved in cognitively mediated processes .
the second relevant issue concerns the definition of self - consciousness .
there is still no consensus on what self - consciousness is or how it works .
over the past century , scholars from different disciplines and theoretical approaches have proposed several models of consciousness ( panksepp , 1998 ; damasio , 1999 ; gallagher , 2000 ; metzinger , 2003 ; morin , 2006 ; edelman et al. , 2011 ; vandekerckhove and panksepp , 2011 ) , which for the sake of brevity are not discussed here .
here , we focus on the most recent , prominent psychobiological and evolutionarily - based perspectives , that conceptualize consciousness levels as developing in a continuum throughout phylogenesis ( tulving , 1985 ; vandekerckhove and panksepp , 2009 , 2011 ) .
in this view , three interdependent levels of self - consciousness are identifiable : ( i ) the non - reflective , affectively rich anoetic ( unknowing ) consciousness , which is believed to involve the basal subcortical system , extending from brainstem to hypothalamus to central thalamic nuclei ; ( ii ) noetic ( knowing ) learning - based consciousness , which relies on activating the lower subcortical ganglia and upper limbic cortical midline structures ; and ( iii ) reflective , metacognitive autonoetic ( self - knowing ) consciousness , which represents a recent achievement of human evolution and relies on associative neocortical brain areas .
experiential anoetic consciousness occurs without the cognitively mediated self - observation of one 's own action .
it is conceptualized as direct , unreflective affective and sensorial - perceptual experience of the world and self ; it represents a primary form of first - person phenomenal " self - experience " and is rooted in the subcortical emotional systems that humans share with lower animals ( vandekerckhove and panksepp , 2009 ) .
although one 's attention is apparently toward the external environment rather than toward oneself , this basic level of consciousness still implies the presence of a minimal unifying implicit instance of self that enables the individual to perceive and to approach , or avoid , the surrounding environment , based on affective experience ( tulving , 1985 ; vogeley and fink , 2003 ; vandekerckhove and panksepp , 2009 ) .
cross - species studies suggest , that oxytocin influences anoetic consciousness .
specifically , oxytocin administration is associated with changes in affective experience and modulation of unreflective / instinctual proximity of the self toward unfamiliar others .
for example , oxytocin modulates social affiliation ( nelson and panksepp , 1998 ) , facilitates approach toward unfamiliar pups in female rats ( pedersen et al. , 1992 ) , enhances social motivation in adult male rats and mice ( lukas et al. , 2011 ) , reduces separation distress vocalizations in abruptly isolated rat pups ( insel and winslow , 1991 ) , enhances confidence behavior in chicks ( panksepp , 2009 ) , while facilitating partner - preference formation in voles ( insel and hulihan , 1995 ) .
given the limited self - reflective abilities in animals , these findings stress the role of oxytocin in influencing the unreflective anoetic form of consciousness and related instinctual emotional behaviors .
in humans , oxytocin administration facilitates the sensitivity and processing of explicit and masked emotional expressions ( leknes et al. , 2012 ; domes et al. , 2013 ; prehn et al. , 2013 ; kanat et al. , 2015 ) and words with evolutionarily self - relevant values ( heinrichs et al. , 2004 ; unkelbach et al. , 2008 ) , prior to their full cognitive evaluation .
presumably , oxytocin facilitates the processing of evolutionarily self - relevant social stimuli and regulates the approach to novel , self - unrelated social stimuli by increasing the salience of social stimuli ( prehn et al. , 2013 ) while reducing stress - reactivity ( heinrichs et al. , 2003 ) and promoting feelings of self - confidence ( colonnello and heinrichs , 2014 ) .
oxytocin administration likely affects noetic levels of self - consciousness .
this level of consciousness is rooted in lower anoetic levels and is associated with learning - based self - awareness and the recognition of oneself as " me ," that is , the object of one 's own observation and the perception of " me " as distinct from " other. " we found , that oxytocin influences implicit self - description : oxytocin administration facilitated the tendency to associate self - related words with positive adjectives in healthy men during an implicit association task ( colonnello and heinrichs , 2014 ) .
in addition , intranasal oxytocin administration sharpens explicit self - and other - recognition during the presentation of videos showing photos of one 's own face morphing into those of an unfamiliar individual , and vice versa .
specifically , participants who received intranasal administration of oxytocin were facilitated in the self - other distinction of one 's own and other 's facial features , regardless of the morphing direction .
this effect was associated with rating one 's own face and other 's faces as comparably pleasant , indicating the facilitation of acceptance of self and others ( colonnello et al. , 2013 ) .
oxytocin 's role in enhancing distinctions between self - and other - related stimuli is corroborated by a study on pain perception .
in this study , participants who received oxytocin exhibited different responses to visualizations of self - and other - directed painful stimulation .
they rated their imaginings of personally experienced pain as less stressful than their thoughts of pain experienced by others ( abu - akel et al. , 2015 ) , which suggests a link between oxytocin - induced dampening of stress reactivity , enhanced self - other distinction , and increased attention to others' needs .
the most complex level of self - consciousness , referred to as autonoetic comprises metacognitive tasks , reflection on oneself and one 's experience , and mental time traveling in one 's own past and future ( suddendorf and corballis , 1997 ; vandekerckhove and panksepp , 2009 ) .
empirical studies have indicated , that the oxytocin system modulates autonoetic self - consciousness .
as cardoso and colleagues demonstrated , increased levels of oxytocin facilitate the recollection of personal memories and positive social affiliation memories ( cardoso et al. , 2014 ) , as well as the tendency to rate oneself with positive personality traits in self - report questionnaires ( cardoso et al. , 2012 ) .
notably , oxytocin 's influences on autonoetic levels of consciousness are based on individual differences and attachment styles ( bartz et al. , 2011 ) .
future studies should investigate whether the effects of oxytocin on autobiographical memories and self - processing might also be linked to an increase in sensitivity toward one 's own attachment representations , regardless of their valence .
while the current sparse data converge in indicating that oxytocin is among the neuromodulators implicated in self - consciousness , it is worth stressing that this research area is still in its infancy and further studies are warranted .
but what specific research paradigms would deepen the understanding of oxytocin 's role in self - consciousness ?
which clinical conditions presenting changes in self - consciousness would benefit from integrating treatments with oxytocin administration ?
undoubtedly , the neuropeptide oxytocin is drawing clinicians' attention due to its effects on several aspects in the social domain .
as we previously proposed ( colonnello et al. , 2013 ; colonnello and heinrichs , 2014 ) , studies of oxytocin 's effects should consider changes not only in one 's perceptions of others but also in the processing of self - related information. from the evolutionary and neuroscience perspective , it is plausible that oxytocin affects self - relatedness processing thanks to involvement of the subcortical - cortical midline structures , ( northoff and panksepp , 2008 ) .
further , at a higher cognitive level , oxytocin likely influences self - and other - related cognition by modulating the brain network activity involved in the shared neural representations of others and self ( lombardo et al. , 2010 ) .
thus , oxytocin 's influences on several aspects of self - consciousness and on the interdependence between self - consciousness levels in clinical conditions characterized by alteration of self and other processing cry out for further research attention .
the current paucity of data on the oxytocin 's effects on noetic self - consciousness also encourages further investigation of its influences on self - other distinction. of note , self - recognition and the sense of self - ownership are among the mechanisms implicated in functional empathic responses .
thus , such investigations would be crucial to furthering our understanding of oxytocin 's role in the relationship between self - other distinction and the ability to shift from self - oriented to other - person - oriented perspectives , as well as its role in self - other distinction , and prosocial behavior , especially in light of the close link between interoception and empathy ( ernst et al. , 2013 ) .
in addition , it would be important to address questions regarding oxytocin 's effects on the noetic knowledge of self - agency ( i.e. , perception of being the author of one 's own actions ) that is likely to be altered in various clinical conditions ( belayachi and van der linden , 2010 ; synofzik et al. , 2010 ) .
the potential effects of oxytocin administration should also be studied in individuals with dysmorphic disorders and in patients with neuropsychological disorders displaying altered " noetic " explicit knowledge of their own body boundaries .
given that levels of self - consciousness unfold over development and that ontogenetic development recapitulates the phylogenetic development , elucidating oxytocin 's influences on the interdependence between self - consciousness levels would also be crucial .
because oxytocin plays a role in social bond formation and in regulating stress responses ( heinrichs et al. , 2003 ) and its influences on autonoetic levels vary as a function of prior attachment experiences ( bartz et al. , 2011 ) , the relation between early social environment , alterations in central oxytocin transmission , and development of noetic and autonoetic self - consciousness warrants extensive investigation through longitudinal studies .
finally , future studies should devote effort to addressing the potential therapeutic role of the oxytocin system ( heinrichs and domes , 2008 ; heinrichs et al. , 2009 ; meyer - lindenberg et al. , 2011 ). by buffering self - disclosure and " re - editing " of self - with - others experiences in psychotherapy , oxytocin administration may help create an affective psychobiological context for facilitating therapeutic changes .

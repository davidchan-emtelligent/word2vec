background microphthalmia with linear skin defects ( mls ) syndrome is a rare x - linked dominant male - lethal developmental disorder characterized by unilateral or bilateral microphthalmia and linear skin defects of the face and neck .
additional features affecting the eyes , heart , brain or genitourinary system can occur , corroborating the intra - and interfamilial phenotypic variability .
the majority of patients display monosomy of the xp22.2 region , where the holocytochrome c - type synthase ( hccs ) gene is located .
case presentation we describe a 15 - year - old - female affected by mls syndrome and autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) .
asd has not previously been reported as a component of mls .
our patient shows a large deletion of 12.9 mb , involving xp22.32 - p22.2 , which encompasses both the hccs gene and autism x - linked genes .
conclusion thus , patients with a large deletion at xp22 might display mls with asd , due to the deletion of contiguous genes , although the highly variable phenotype of these patients could be influenced by several genetic mechanisms , including different tissue - specific x - inactivation and somatic mosaicism .
mls syndrome autism spectrum disorder xp deletion x - inactivation phenotypic variability background first described in 1988 , the microphthalmia with linear skin defects ( mls ) syndrome ( omim 309801 ) is also known as midas ( microphthalmia , dermal aplasia , sclerocornea ) syndrome [ 1 ] , but the mls acronym is more appropriate since dermal aplasia has never been described in histologic samples [ 2 ] .
this rare x - linked dominant disease with male lethality in utero belongs to neurocutaneous development disorders , and is characterized by unilateral or bilateral microphthalmia as well as linear skin defects , along blaschko lines , limited to the face and neck .
most patients with mls display the classical phenotypic features ; however , a high intra - and interfamilial clinical variability exists , and additional features affecting the eyes , heart , brain and genitourinary system may be present [ 3 ] .
conventional and molecular cytogenetic studies of the majority of patients with mls syndrome have revealed segmental monosomy of the xp22 chromosomal region .
in particular , the mls critical region has been identified at 610 kb in xp22.2 , and includes the holocytochrome c - type synthase ( hccs ) gene , encoding the mitochondrial holocytochrome c - type synthase , that is the gene whose mutation is known to cause mls syndrome [ 4,5 ] .
wimplinger et al .
[ 5 ] detected that the final product of hcss activity is cytochrome c , which plays a key role in apoptosis .
therefore hccs mutations impair apoptosis , leading to an abnormal eye and brain embryonic development .
it has been also hypothesized that a disturbance of both the oxidative phosphorylation and the balance between apoptosis and necrosis , as well as tissue specific x - inactivation patterns , may contribute to the variable phenotype [ 5 ] .
here we report the first case of mls syndrome with associated asd features .
our patient shows a large deletion involving xpter - p22.2 .
the deletion encompasses both the hccs gene and several autism x - linked genes , suggesting that large xp deletions might be associated with both mls and asd , probably due to the deletion of contiguous genes .
however , several genetic mechanisms can influence the highly variable phenotype of this exceedingly rare disorder .
case presentation the proband , a 15 - year - old female , was born to a 28 year - old father and a 27 year - old mother .
her father and sister are phenotypically normal .
the mother presented a relatively short stature ( cm 160 ) , and corneal degeneration , diagnosed at birth , for which she underwent enucleation , and left eye prosthesis .
family history was remarkable for not otherwise specified anxiety disorders , and epilepsy in the maternal line .
an intrauterine growth restriction was revealed at the 22th gestational week .
she was born at 38 weeks gestation via emergency cesarean section , due to fetal distress .
birth weight was 2.530 gr ( 10th centile ) , length 47 cm ( 10 - 50th centile ) and head circumference 33 cm ( 10 - 50th centile ) .
the apgar scores were 7 and 8 .
immediately after birth , several life - threatening respiratory distress events occured , requiring patient intubation .
slight asymmetry of the cerebral ventricles with hyperechogenicity of the parenchyma on the superior - lateral horns of the lateral ventricles was detected at ultrasound examination of the brain .
the newborn female showed linear and erythematous skin lesions on the cheek , extending to the nose and chin .
ophthalmologic evaluation revealed leukoma cornea and microphthalmia of the right eye , and sclerocornea and anophthalmia of the left .
the clinical diagnosis of the mls syndrome was made .
motor development was slightly delayed : she walked independently at 2 years of age , as commonly observed in blind children , instead speech development was normal until 18 - 24 months of age ( she was able to speak simple sentences ) , after that she started to show echolalia and verbal stereotypy .
at the age of 30 months , a further deterioration of language and cognitive abilities occurred , with loss of previously acquired skills : expressive language was limited to two - three single words , and unintelligible verbalizations .
she gradually developed seriously impaired communication , socialization and cognition skills , as well as sleep disturbances ( difficulty falling asleep ) .
the patient was admitted to our department at the age of 15 years , due to progressive social avoidance and self - harm behaviors developing during the last year .
physical examination revealed skeletal abnormalities such as micromelia , lower limb asymmetry , left scoliosis and pes cavus bilaterally .
our patient had evident dysmorphic features , including microcephaly ( head circumference < 3rd centile ) , flattened occiput , hypotelorism , low setting ears , micrognathia , height and weight below the third percentile , and a broad based gait .
in addition , she showed areas of scar - like aplasia cutis following the blaschko lines along the cheek , nose and chin ( figure 1 ) .
neurologic examination showed diffuse hypotonia .
an ophthalmologic evaluation revealed right eye microphthalmia with opaque cornea and left eye anophthalmia ( with a prosthesis ) , with total blindness in the left eye , and perception of light in the right one .
figure 1 dysmorphic features in the patient .
physical examination revealed areas of scar - like aplasia cutis following the blaschko lines along the cheek , nose and chin .
cardiac and otorinolaringoiatric examinations were normal , as well as auditory brainstem responses and asleep electroencephalography .
brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a slight hyperintensity in the peritrigonal white matter bilaterally , probably due to neonatal distress .
routine blood tests , plasma amino acids , urine organic acids and lactate were unremarkable .
psychiatric and behavioral assessments , conducted by direct observation of the patient 's spontaneous behavior , revealed social withdrawal .
indeed , she preferred to be alone , she did not turn around if her name was called , and she did not respond to instructions and appeared distant when attempts were made to interact with her .
she showed limited emotional non - verbal contact and lacked social skills .
communication was limited to two - three single words and vocalizations such as vowel sounds or unintelligible verbalizations and failure to compensate through gesture .
she also showed stereotypic and repetitive motor mannerisms , many restricted , ritualistic and " sameness " behaviors ( e.g. , listening to the same music all the time ) , that were not due to visual impairment .
moreover , she displayed self - harm tendencies and restricted personal autonomy .
autistic features identified in our patient were not due to visual impairment and were confirmed by standardized rating scales including the childhood autistic rating scale ( cars ) , autism diagnostic interview - revised ( adi - r ) , vineland adaptive behavior scale .
indeed , on the cars she scored 44 points ( cut - off score 30 ) , reflecting severe autism .
the diagnosis was confirmed by the adi - r. the vineland adaptive behavior scale showed severe deficits in adaptive behaviors .
her cognitive abilities were not assessed using the standardized intelligence test because of the severe blindness .
however , empirical judgment suggested moderate intellectual disability .
a diagnosis of the mls syndrome with autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) and moderate intellectual disability was made , according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5th edition ( dsm - v ) criteria .
written informed consent was obtained from the parent of the patient .
genetic investigation genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood samples .
dna concentration was measured by fluorimeter ( amersham , piscataway , nj ) using the hoechst reagent and adjusted to 400 ng / ml.array - cgh analysis was performed using the cytochip oligo isca 4x44k ( techno genetics srl , italy ) .
this array is composed of 60 - mer oligonucleotides spaced at about 75 kb density across the genome .
labeling and hybridization were carried out following the manufacturer 's protocol .
slides were scanned on the innoscan 710 ( innopsys ) , and analyzed using the bluefuse multi v3.1 ( bluegnome ) .
the analysis revealed a terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome x , with a loss in copy number at the xp22.33p22.2 region [ chrx : 702 - 12,949,422 ( hg19 ) , size 12,948,721 bp ] ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 array cgh analysis with a genomic resolution of 75 kb showing a terminal microdeletion of about 12,9 mb into xp22.2 - pter region .
result of array cgh analysis were confirmed by fish .
bac probes rp11 - 509b6 , rp11 - 109p4 , and rp11 - 102 m2 ( bluegnome ) , mapping in the deleted region , produced hybridization signals only on the normal chromosome x. the same deletion was revealed in the patient 's mother , and confirmed by fish analysis which also excluded chromosomal mosaicism on interphase nuclei .
therefore the final karyotype of the patient was designed as ( iscn 2013 ) : 46,xx.arr xp22.33p22.2 ( 702 - 12,949,422 ) x1 mat .
x inactivation state was investigated using humara x - chromosome assay [ 6 ] .
x - chromosome inactivation was skewed , with preferential inactivation of the x chromosome carrying the terminal deletion ( ratio of 10 % to 90 % in the proband ; 15 % to 85 % in the mother ) .
conclusion in our patient , acgh analysis has revealed a large terminal deletion of 12,9 mb ( xp22.2 - - > xp22.33 ) , with proximal breakpoint at 12,949,422 .
the deletion was confirmed by fish ; an identical imbalance was present in the mother .
the deletion involves 52 omim genes , and is associated with several diseases .
in male patients , xp deletions result in a contiguous gene syndrome [ 7,8 ] , and become lethal in utero when extend beyond 9.7 mb from xpter [ 9 ] , or include some regions , i.e. the 610 kb minimal critical region for mls , with loss of the hcss gene [ 10 ] .
females with terminal xp deletions are characterized by a milder phenotype with highly variable clinical manifestations , depending on the size of the deletion as well as from other factors , such as tissue specific x - inactivation patterns and / or chromosomal mosaicism [ 4 ] .
considering our patient phenotype , we can attribute the proportionate short stature (< 3rd centile ) and the skeletal abnormalities to the loss of the shox gene , which is located in the telomeric portion of the pseudoautosomal region 1 ( par1 ) .
the gene is dose - dependent , and escape x inactivation whereby its loss may cause leri - weill syndrome or non syndromic short stature [ 11 ] .
in addition , in our case the loss of the xp22.2 region includes the genes mid1 , hccs , and arhgap6 , and is associated with mls [ 1 - 3 ] .
our patient shows mls major criteria ( right eye microphthalmia and left anophthalmia , areas of scar - like aplasia cutis along the cheek , nose and chin ) , and several minor criteria , namely right cornea leukoma , left sclerocornea , developmental delay , intellectual disability and dysmorphic features .
the mother , with the same deletion , shows a milder phenotype with left eye corneal degeneration as the only sign attributable to mls .
otherwise this is not surprising , being well known in literature the very high intra - and interfamilial variability of mls [ 3,4,12 ] .
several mechanism has been proposed .
in some family chromosomal mosaicism can account for the clinical variability [ 4 ] .
however in our case such mechanism has been excluded by fish analysis , and x - inactivation in blood cells does not explain the variable phenotype observed in the family .
therefore , according to literature , different tissue specific x - inactivation patterns seem the more plausible reason for the mild vs severe mother / daughter phenotype [ 13,14 ] .
finally , a further , more peculiar , part of our patient phenotype regards autistic behavioral features .
our patient fulfilled dsm - v criteria for asd on persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across contexts and repetitive patterns of behavior , interests , or activities .
while developmental delay and intellectual disability have been reported in a few patients , to the best of our knowledge asd has never previously been recognized in mls patients [ 3,15 ] .
differently large xp deletions seem associated with learning impairment and autistic tendencies , even if the published cases are very rare , and a detailed and thorough developmental assessment of asd has never been reported [ 10 ] .
in particular chocholska et al .
[ 13 ] described a family with an interstitial 7.7 mb xp22.2 - 22.3 deletion : the son ( iii / 2 ) showed autism and developmental delay .
hobson et al .
[ 10 ] reported a 20 - year - old female with a terminal xp deletion very similar to our case ( proximal breakpoint at 12,024,000 bp ) with short stature , mls , moderate learning difficulty associated with autistic traits ( obsessive behaviors , routines , lack of empathy ) .
furthermore autism , developmental delay , and dysmorphic features were present in a 10 - year - old patient with a de novo interstitial xp22 deletion extending from 5,005,810 to 10,556,218 bp [ 16 ] .
therefore we can affirm that xp22 region can play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of autism , based on the phenotype of the rare patients with large xp22 deletion as well as on the presence of several genes potentially associated with a behavioral phenotype that fits within the autism spectrum disorder , i.e. nlgn4x , vcx genes [ 10,13,16 - 18 ] .
nlgn proteins are postsynaptic adhesion proteins , expressed in brain , essential for synapse organization and function [ 19 ] .
mutations / haploinsufficiency of nlgn4x seem involved in the pathogenesis of asd [ 16,20 ] , but it 's not clear if such role regards a limited fraction (< 1 %) of asd patients or nlgn4x variants could account for a more relevant role in asd [ 21 ] .
vcx genes role in cognitive impairment has been demonstrated ; in addition these genes might contribute to the onset of neuropsychiatric illness , i.e. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ 16 ] .
considering all these evidences , we can assume that the presence of asd seems related to the loss of the xp22.32p22.31 region containing nlgn4x / vcx genes , and not to the more proximal mls critical region .
however further cases are needed to draw more definitive issues .
in conclusion , the description of our case lends further support to the notion that females with large deletions of xp or a 45,x constitution may be at increased risk of autism as the result of deletions of autism - linked genes [ 17 ] , indicating the need to carry out a detailed neuropsychological assessment in patients with mls to check for asd , especially when mls critical region haploinsufficiency occurs in the context of a large xp deletion .
in these cases a multi - disciplinary approach to the management of children with the mls syndrome is highly desirable .
moreover , genotype / phenotype correlation studies are needed to better characterize the contribution of the individual genes mapping in xp22 to the autistic spectrum disorders .

situs inversus is an uncommon anomaly with rare incidence .
some cases of situs inversus totalis have been described with different types of associations .
here we report a case of situs inversus with carcinoma of the gastric cardia .
situs inversus carcinoma of the gastric cardia case report background situs inversus is an uncommon anomaly with an incidence varying from 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 20,000 live births [ 1 ] , with a male : female ratio of 3:2 [ 2 ] .
situs inversus viscerum can be either total or partial .
total situs inversus can be called a mirror image dextrocardia , characterized by a heart and stomach at the right side of the midline while the liver and gall bladder are at the left side .
although this does not seem to affect normal health or life expectancy , situs inversus viscerum only does not affect the patient 's health when it is premalignant .
generally , this rare genetic anomaly is discovered or diagnosed incidentally during thoracic and abdominal imaging .
the exact etiology of situs inversus is still unknown , but an autosomal recessive inheritance mode has been speculated [ 3 ] .
some cases of situs inversus totalis have been described in previous studies [ 2,4 - 8 ] .
we here report a case of situs inversus with carcinoma of the gastric cardia .
case presentation a 52 - year - old male patient , who complained of a stomachache lasting over the last 5 months , along with the symptoms of fatigue and weight loss , was referred to our clinic .
an abnormal shadow in the cardia was recognized during routine x - ray examination and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination .
upon admission , a physical examination revealed a pulse rate of 100 beats per minute and blood pressure of 115 / 68 mmhg , while the liver , spleen , and tumor were not palpable in the physical examination .
results of chest x - ray imaging taken in an erect position showed dextrocardia , a fundic gas shadow on the right dome of the diaphragm , and a liver shadow at the left side .
nothing abnormal was found in the respiratory system .
the laboratory findings were hemoglobin 11 g / dl and white blood cells 6,500 / m3 .
dextrocardia was seen on the chest x - ray ( figure 1 ) , and a typical congenital dextrocardia was found on the electrocardiographic findings .
the endoscopic examination identified a tumor in the gastric cardia .
the pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated and partly poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma .
surgery was performed on 25 july 2011 , and macroscopic metastasis was found in lymph nodes 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 8a , and 8p ( for the numbering rules , see [ 9 ]) .
the operative procedure was billroth i reconstruction and proximal gastrectomy with d2 lymph node discectomy .
the macroscopic findings of the resected specimen showed irregularly shaped gastric cardia of 20 mm x 18 mm size .
the histological finding showed proliferation of moderately and poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma , positive lymph vessels , and venous invasion .
this was a type i adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction ( aeg ) [ 10 ] .
metastases were recognized in lymph nodes 1 , 3 , and 8p in the sentinel lymph node biopsy .
the patient 's postoperative course was uneventful ; on day 15 after surgery , the patient was discharged from the hospital and commenced chemotherapy .

discussion situs inversus is a positional anomaly that rotates the viscera of the internal abdomen , and it is a rare congenital anomaly with a population incidence of only 0.001 % to 0.01 % [ 11 ] .
it is suggested that the immobility of nodal cilia inhibits the flow of extra - embryonic fluid during the embryonic period , and this leads to the development of situs inversus [ 12 ] .
its transmission mode is autosomal recessive inheritance , but its precise genetic mechanism is still unidentified .
more than one genetic mutation including the gene mutations that cause ciliopathy and cystic renal diseases has been implicated in the etiopathogenesis .
various modalities can be used to diagnose situs inversus , such as electrocardiograms , radiographic studies , and computed tomography ( ct ) scans with oral and intravenous contrast , ultrasound , and barium studies [ 11,13 ] .
there have been isolated reports of situs inversus associated with peptic conditions [ 14 ] , ulcer perforation [ 15 ] , amoebic liver abscess [ 8 ] , acute cholecystitis [ 7,16 ] , cholelithiasis [ 6,17,18 ] , acute appendicitis [ 4,19 ] , and intestinal obstruction [ 20 ] .
the occurrence of carcinoma of the gastric cardia with situs inversus is very rare , and very few cases have been reported in the literature [ 5,21 - 24 ] .
there are no data on the relationship between gastric cancer and situs inversus totalis .
it is very important to carry out a careful and cautious assessment of abnormalities by preoperative examination , especially by laparoscopic procedures .
conclusion the occurrence of gastric cardia with situs inversus is very rare .
proximal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection ( d2 ) is the preferred operation for carcinoma of gastric cardia .
chemotherapy is essential for patients with lymph node metastasis .

mutations in methyl - cpg - binding protein 2 ( mecp2 ) gene have been shown to manifest in a neurodevelopmental disorder that is called rett syndrome .
a typical problem that occurs during development is a disturbance of breathing .
to address the role of inhibitory neurons , we generated a mouse line that restores mecp2 in inhibitory neurons in the brainstem by crossbreeding a mouse line that expresses the cre - recombinase ( cre ) in inhibitory neurons under the control of the glycine transporter 2 ( glyt2 , slc6a5 ) promotor ( glyt2 - cre ) with a mouse line that has a floxed - stop mutation of the mecp2 gene ( mecp2stop / y ) .
unrestrained whole - body - plethysmography at postnatal day p60 revealed a low respiratory rate and prolonged respiratory pauses in mecp2stop / y mice .
in contrast , glyt2 - cre positive mecp2stop / y mice ( cre + ; mecp2stop / y ) showed greatly improved respiration and were indistinguishable from wild type littermates .
these data support the concept that alterations in inhibitory neurons are important for the development of the respiratory phenotype in rett syndrome .
neurodevelopmental disorders autism spectrum inhibition deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft10.13039 / 501100001659hu797 / 8 - 1 introduction the neurodevelopmental disorder rett syndrome ( omim 312750 , rett , 1966 ) is caused by mutations in the gene for the methyl - cpg - binding protein 2 ( mecp2 ) .
although mecp2 is a x - chromosomal gene , rett syndrome usually describes the phenotype of girls with a heterozygous mutation that occurs at a prevalence of 1 / 10,000 - 1 / 15,000 female births .
rett syndrome is often inherited from maternal and paternal de novo germline mutations ( thomas , 1996 ; girard et al. , 2001 ) but also can be transmitted through generations if the x - chromosomal inactivation of the maternal mutation is skewed ( hoffbuhr et al. , 2001 ) .
after a latent period of approximately 1 - 3 years ( rett , 1966 ) girls develop a neurological phenotype that includes stereotypic hand movements , seizures , and typically also autonomic dysfunctions with breathing abnormalities as well as mental retardation with loss of language skills ( jellinger , 2003 ) .
the clinical spectrum in boys with mecp2 - mutations is more diverse , ranging from a classic form of the rett syndrome ( masuyama et al. , 2005 ) to severe cases of neonatal encephalopathy ( villard , 2007 ; reichow et al. , 2015 ) .
alterations of breathing are observed both in male and female patients with mecp2 - mutations .
the respiratory phenotype of female rett syndrome patients is characterized by periods of hyperventilation alternating with prolonged periods of breath - holdings causing intermittent hypoxia ( julu et al. , 2001 ) , which often resemble apneustic breathing ( kerr and julu , 1999 ) .
these disturbances of breathing are discussed as a main cause of sudden death ( kerr et al. , 1997 ) .
in contrast , the male phenotype often exhibits respiratory insufficiency soon after birth with hypoventilation and prolonged apneas ( geerdink et al. , 2002 ; kankirawatana et al. , 2006 ; schule et al. , 2008 ) .
there are many different mouse models available that resemble symptoms of the classical rett syndrome ( ricceri et al. , 2008 ) .
the male mecp2 - / y null mouse is often used as a model ( guy et al. , 2001 ) since it shows impaired locomotion including hind limb clasping and autonomic dysfunctions with respiratory abnormalities .
however , it becomes evident that the typical alteration of breathing in male mecp2 - deficient mice is rather hypoventilation that presents with a reduced respiratory rate and minute ventilation together with a high number of apneas ( viemari et al. , 2005 ; chao et al. , 2010 ; vogelgesang , 2013 ; wegener et al. , 2014 ) , but not apneustic breathing ( stettner et al. , 2007 ) .
these observations suggest that male mecp2 - deficient mice might be a good model for breathing phenotype of male patients .
nevertheless , both data from male mecp2 - deficient mice and heterozygous female mice point toward alterations in inhibitory neurons that are involved in disease progression .
for example , a knockout of the mecp2 gene in inhibitory neurons , using a viaat - specific expression of the cre - recombinase , has been shown to be sufficient for the generation of respiratory phenotype ( chao et al. , 1997 ) .
although viaat is known to be expressed both in gabaergic as well as in glycinergic neurons ( chaudhry et al. , 1998 ) , the phenotype of the viaat - cre induced mecp2 - ko was attributed to the loss of mecp2 in gabaergic neurons ( chao et al. , 1997 ) .
early changes of inhibitory synaptic transmission that are observed in mecp2 - / y mice at p7 were also effecting the gabaergic system ( medrihan et al. , 2008 ) .
since gaba / glycine co - transmission is common at p7 in the respiratory system ( rahman et al. , 2013 ) and viaat - levels in mecp2 - / y mice were also reduced ( medrihan et al. , 2008 ) , we assume that alteration of synaptic inhibition is one of the key failures during early development .
we therefore can hypothesize that breathing can be improved if mecp2 is introduced inhibitory neurons of the respiratory network .
the current experiments were designed to test if the breathing and / or the developmental progression of the disease is significantly improved by preventing the loss of mecp2 in inhibitory neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord , which are involved in the regulation of breathing ( richter and smith , 2014 ) .
to achieve this goal we used a mouse line allowing expression of the cre - recombinase in inhibitory neurons under control of the glyt2 - promotor ( ishihara et al. , 2010 ; rahman et al. , 2015 ) that was crossbred to a global knock - out of mecp2 , which has been achieved by a knock - in of a loxp - site flanked stop codon into the locus of the mecp2 gene ( mecp2stop / y mice ; guy et al. , 2007 ) .
we focused on changes of breathing , that are typically observed in the male mouse models of the rett syndrome , regardless whether mecp2 is knocked out in all cells ( guy et al. , 2001 ) or only in inhibitory neurons ( chao et al. , 2010 ) .
methods animals and genotyping animals were bred in the central animal facility of the university medical center of the georg - august university gottingen and treated in accordance with the german protection of animals act ( tierschg ) and with the guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals issued by the european communities council directive 2010 / 63 / eu. the file number of the lower saxony authorities ( nds .
landesamt fur verbraucherschutz und lebensmittelsicherheit , laves ) is 33.9 - 42502 - 04 - 15 / 1764 .
heterozygous female founder mice ( b6.129p2 - mecp2tm2bird / j ; mecp2stop / x ) were ordered from the jackson laboratory ( stock number : 006849 ) .
glyt2 - cre ( tg ( slc6a5 - icre ) 121veul ) mice were originally provided by volker eulenburg ( erlangen ) .
mating was always made from mecp2stop / x heterozygous female ( guy et al. , 2007 ) and glyt2 - cre positive male mice ( ishihara et al. , 2010 ) .
both lines were maintained on a c57 / b6 background .
after birth all offspring were raised by foster mice .
genotyping was performed using standard pcr technique described in the original publication of the glyt2 - cre mice ( ishihara et al. , 2010 ) or as provided by the jackson laboratory ( https :// www2.jax.org / protocolsdb / f ? p = 116:1:0 : : no :::) for the mecp2stop / x mice .
immunohistochemistry mice were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane ( 1 - chloro - 2,2,2 - trifluoroethyl - difluoromethylether , abbott , germany ) and perfused transcardially using 4 % paraformaldehyde ( pfa ) in phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) .
brains were removed and post - fixed in 4 % pfa in pbs for 24 h and stored in pbs until used for sectioning .
before sectioning , brains were equilibrated in hepes buffer ( 7.5 g nacl , 0.3 g kcl , 0.06 g kh2po4 , 0.13 g na2hpo4 , 2 g glucose , 2.4 ml 10 mm hepes , 0.1 g mgcl2 , 0.05 g mgso4 , 0.165 g cacl2 , ph 7.4 ) for 48 h , cryoprotected in 15 % sucrose in pbs for 24 h followed by equilibration in 30 % sucrose in pbs for 24 h at 4degreesc , and then frozen at - 80degreesc .
series of 30 - mum - thick brain sections ranging from cervical spinal cord to midbrain colliculi were cut using a freezing microtome ( frigocut , reichert - jung ) .
sections were stored in hepes buffer .
all buffers were supplemented with small amount sodium azide ( nan3 ) .
antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer ( 10 mm citric acid , 0.05 % tween20 , ph 6.0 ) at 80degreesc for 30 min .
sections were incubated in blocking buffer ( pbs , 0.1 % triton - x100 , 1 % tryptone / peptone ) for 60 min at rt to permeabilize and block non - specific binding .
primary antibody ( rabbit anti - mecp2 , cell signaling , cat. no .
3456s ) was diluted 1:400 in blocking buffer and incubated for 60 min at rt. after rinsing in buffer ( pbs , 0.05 % tween20 , 0.3 % triton x100 ) , sections were incubated for 1 h at rt in the dark with anti - rabbit atto647 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( sigma - aldrich , cat. no. 40839 ) diluted 1 : 400 in blocking buffer .
during washing , sections were counterstained with dapi and mounted onto microscope - slides and coverslipped with fluorescent mounting medium ( dako ) .
immunofluorescence was analyzed with an axio imager.z1 fluorescence microscope ( zeiss ) equipped with a mercury vapor short - arc lamp ( hbo100 , zeiss ) , filters for dapi ( ex .
335 - 383 nm , bs .
395 nm , em .

625 - 655 nm , bs .
660 nm , em .
665 - 715 nm ) and a digital camera ( axiocam mrm , zeiss ) .
images were taken at 10x magnification with zeiss zen2 software and imported into fiji / imagej , digitally adjusted if necessary for brightness and contrast , and assembled into plates using coreldraw software .
composite pictures were generated by the microsoft image composite editor ( ice ) software after background rolling ball subtraction ( fiji / imagej ) .
unrestrained whole - body - plethysmography to determine parameters of ventilation we used unrestrained whole - body - plethysmography .
mice were placed in an acrylic glass chamber that was connected to a differential low - pressure trd5700 pressure transducer ( buxco ) .
the second channel of the pressure transducer was connected to a reference chamber that was connected to room air through a fine - mesh screen .
warming of the inspired air and cooling during expiration results in pressure changes ( drorbaugh and fenn , 1955 ; bartlett and tenney , 1970 ) .
since the chamber allows air to pass in and out through a defined resistor ( a fine - mesh screen ) the pressure changes in the chamber represent air flow ( principle of a screen pneumotach ) .
the leak in the chamber introduced a time constant for the decay of pressure changes of 40 ms. a negative pressure bias flow of 1 l / min was introduced by a small animal bias flow generator ( dsi ) .
the bias flow was also used to calibrate the chamber .
data were acquired using a pc - computer running ponemah software ( dsi ) .
flow signals were exported to ascii and imported to labchart software ( adinstruments ) , band - pass filtered ( 0.5 - 20 hz ) offline .
mice were allowed to explore the chamber for 12 min to adapt to the new environment before the measurement was started .
for analysis of respiratory cycle length ( inspiratory peak to peak interval ) a period of 3 min was analyzed by the peak analysis module of labchat software .
breathing frequencies were calculated as the reciprocal of the averaged inspiratory interval .
peak to peak intervals that were longer than 1 s ( 0.75 s ) were counted during the 3 min period and were referred to as number of apneas > 1 s / 3 min (> 0.75 s / 3 min ) .
the coefficient of variation ( cv ) of the cycle period ( inspiratory interval ) and the irregularity score ( is = 100 * abs [( intn - intn - 1 )/ intn - 1 ]) of the interval were calculated to assess variability of breathing ( wegener et al. , 2014 ) .
when the mice were transferred from the plethysmography chamber back to the cage , they were grasped by the tail and kept in air for up to 20 s to test for hind limb clasping .
hind limbs clasping ( hlc ) was noted if both hind limbs were retracted toward the abdomen .
the numeric values ( shown in table 1 ) are % of animals showing hlc .
the operator was not blinded to the genotype .

results immunostaining for mecp2 expression in hindbrain in a first set of experiments we tested if excision of the stop - cassette in mecp2stop / y mice by the expression of cre - recombinase using glyt2 - cre mice was effective to allow expression of mecp2 in hindbrain neurons .
as shown in figure 1 , mecp2 expression was preserved in a subset of brainstem neurons of mecp2stop / y glyt2 - cre positive mice .
notably only a few neurons expressed mecp2 in the cortex and hippocampus .

respiratory phenotype is diminished if mecp2 - expression is preserved in glyt2 - cre mice mice were functionally analyzed in two groups ( table 1 ) .
the first group was tested at ~ 6 week ( p40 ) , when mecp2stop / y mice were reported to develop first symptoms ( guy et al. , 2007 ) .
at this earlier stage we did not observe any difference in the respiratory rate nor in the number of apneas , that are a typical problem of the phenotype ( wegener et al. , 2014 ) .
also no significant change in the motor system was observed and only one mecp2stop / y mouse at this age showed hind limb clasping ( table 1 ) .
at p40 the breathing frequency of freely moving wt mice was 405.9 +/ - 39.8 breaths per minute ( bpm ; mean +/ - sd ) in control ( cre + ; mecp2 +/ y ) mice 372.2 +/ - 78.9 bpm was recorded .
at this early stage , mecp2stop / y mice were indistinguishable from control mice .
they had a breathing rate of 354.2 +/ - 81.0 bpm ( p = 0.050 ) , while in mice , in which the stop - codon was removed in inhibitory neurons ( cre + ; mecp2stop / y ) , the rate was 320.6 +/ - 80.0 bpm .
at p60 a significant change in the breathing was observed in mecp2stop / y mice ( figure 2 ) .
while wt mice ( 388.7 +/ - 54.7 bpm ) and control mice ( 394.4 +/ - 60.8 bpm ) showed a regular breathing , mecp2stop / y mice had only 292.5 +/ - 104.7 bpm ( p = 0.030 vs. wt mice , p = 0.006 vs. control mice ) .
in contrast , the breathing rate of mice in which the mecp2 was restored in hindbrain inhibitory neurons ( cre + ; mecp2stop / y ) was indistinguishable from wt and control littermates ( 372.8 +/ - 68.0 bpm ; p = 0.873 vs. wt and p = 0.851 vs. control mice ) .
a significant number of pauses that were longer than 1 s was only observed in mecp2stop / y glyt2 - cre negative mice ( figure 2 ; table 1 ) .
although the motor phenotype was not completely developed at p60 , hind limb clasping was observed only in 44.4 % of mecp2stop / y mice but neither in control and wt mice nor glyt2 - cre positive mecp2stop / y mice ( table 1 ) .

survival is not improved although we observed a significant improvement of breathing at ages mecp2 - deficient mice start to deteriorate , we did not find an improvement of the overall survival in glyt2 - cre positive mecp2stop / y mice ( figure 3 ) , indicating that the obvious improvement of breathing is not preventing a further progression of the disease .
figure 3 kaplan - meier plot of survival for control mice ( glyt2 - cre ; blue ) , mecp2 - deficient mecp2stop / y mice ( red ) and mice , in which mecp2 was expressed in glyt2 - cre positive neurons ( cre + ; mecp2stop / y , green ) .
discussion our data support the concept that a mecp2 - deficiency in inhibitory neurons is a key factor in generation of the breathing phenotype in male mecp2 - deficient mice .
an early reintroduction of mecp2 in neurons , which express the glycine transporter 2 , improves ventilation and eliminates prolonged periods of apnea , which both are the typical signs in male mecp2 - deficient mice in vivo ( viemari et al. , 2005 ; chao et al. , 2010 ; wegener et al. , 2014 ) .
this observation is in line with the results from a conditional mecp2 knock out in gabaergic neurons ( chao et al. , 2010 ) .
although the respiratory phenotype was observed to start rather late in the viaat - cre mediated model - - the data shown by chao and colleagues were from postnatal week 32 - - the observed changes are typical for male mecp2 - deficient mice ( chao et al. , 2010 ) .
in our hands , mecp2stop / y mice developed first signs of altered breathing after p40 and hypoventilation became significantly different to control mice around p60 .
when the stop - codon was deleted by the cre - recombinase in glyt2 - cre positive neurons the development of this typical change in breathing were alleviated ( figure 2 ) indicating that expression of mecp2 in hindbrain inhibitory neurons is sufficient for preventing the development of the respiratory phenotype .
we assume that this rescue occurs in both type of inhibitory neurons in the respiratory network , since during embryonic development , glyt2 - cre is expressed not only in glycinergic neurons ( gomeza et al. , 2003b ) but also in gabaergic neurons ( rahman et al. , 2015 ) .
additional experiments are required to distinguish between the role of gabaergic and glycinergic neurons .
however , reasonable evidence points toward disturbances in the gabaergic system .
at first , 7 day old male mecp2 - deficient mice show early changes in gabaa - receptor expression and postsynaptic gaba currents in the pre - botzinger complex ( medrihan et al. , 2008 ) .
furthermore , substantial changes in gabaergic transmission in the kolliker - fuse region of the pons have been reported to contribute to the breathing phenotype in adult heterozygous females ( abdala et al. , 2016 ) .
on the other hand , pharmacological improvements of breathing phenotype can also be attributed to an improvement of gabaergic transmission ( abdala et al. , 2010 ; voituron and hilaire , 2011 ; bittolo et al. , 2016 ) .
moreover , it is reasonable to assume that any change of gabaergic transmission that affects breathing is located in the hindbrain since neither the conditional mecp2 knock out in parvalbumin - positive neurons ( he et al. , 2014 ; ito - ishida et al. , 2015 ) nor in somatostatin - positive neurons ( ito - ishida et al. , 2015 ) were able to mimic the breathing phenotype of the conditional viaat - dependent ( chao et al. , 2010 ) or constitutional mecp2 knock out in vivo ( viemari et al. , 2005 ) .
we cannot exclude that the repression of mecp2 in glyt2 - cre positive inhibitory neurons , which is supposed to start during embryonic development , is just delaying the onset of the respiratory phenotype by improving inhibitory neurotransmission without affecting the disturbance in glutamatergic neurons or glial cells .
it was recently shown ( garg et al. , 2015 ) that restoration of mecp2 in glutamatergic ( vglut - cre +/ - ) neurons significantly improved premature lethally of male mecp2 - deficient mice ( mecp2stop / y ) .
although no information is giving regarding the respiratory phenotype in that publication , their data favor a role of glutamatergic neurons in the disease progression .
interestingly , restoration of mecp2 in astrocytes also improved both breathing and lifespan ( lioy et al. , 2011 ) .
we can only speculate whether re - expression of mecp2 in astrocytes improved the breathing by effecting transport of the inhibitory neurotransmitters ( gomeza et al. , 2003a ; szoke et al. , 2006 ) and excitatory neurotransmitters ( schnell et al. , 2011 ) or whether other factors unrelated to synaptic transmission in the respiratory network are important .
outlook it has been suggested that hypoxia in younger mecp2 - deficient mice and the resulting oxidative stress is an important factor for the progression and pathogenesis of rett syndrome ( de felice et al. , 2009 , 2012 ) .
however , our data shine new light on this concept .
although breathing disturbances are strongly improved or at least delayed when mecp2 is preserved in inhibitory neurons , no prolongation of the life span was observed , suggesting that not the respiratory network failure but rather the loss of mecp2 in other brain region and especially in excitatory neurons is promoting the overall deterioration of mecp2 - deficent mice .

the mottling score , a perfusion parameter used for decades , has been proposed to correlate with septic shock survival [ 2 ] , and was tested in this study as a clinical tool in predicting mortality .
methods a prospective observational study was conducted , with patients consecutively admitted to a tertiary hospital icu in brasilia , brazil. from july 2011 to may 2012 , all patients diagnosed with septic shock were enrolled .
demographic data , diagnoses , shock origin and severity scores were recorded .
after initial resuscitation , the score was registered in the first 3 days by the same observer , considering the score on the lower limb without an arterial catheter , or the worst between the lower limbs , and the worst in the 3 days .
exclusion criteria were terminal illness with no intervention decision and incomplete data .
the scores are pooled in group 1 ( scores 0 and 1 ) , group 2 ( scores 2 and 3 ) and group 3 ( scores 4 and 5 ) to compare mortality .
statistical analysis was made using the chi - square test .
results one hundred and seventeen patients were analyzed ; 20 were excluded ( 18 terminal illness , two with incomplete data ) .
ninety - seven patients were included ; the mean age was 72.8 years , mean saps ii score was 46.8 ( sd +/ - 15.7 ) , mean apache ii score was 19.2 ( sd +/ - 8.1 ) ; mean norepinephrine dose was 1.25 mug / kg / minute ; mean length of stay in icu was 19.2 days ( 1 to 176 ) ; mottling score distribution was : score 0 : 41 patients ; score 1 : 33 patients ; score 2 : 14 patients ; score 3 : two patients ; score 4 : three patients ; score 5 : four patients .
the sepsis origin was as follows : 65 , pulmonary ( 67 %) ; 18 , abdominal ( 18.5 %) ; nine , urinary ( 9.5 %) ; two , osseous ( 2 %) ; one , mediastinal ; one , skin and soft tissue ; and one , central nervous system ( 1 % each ) .
comparing the mortality in groups 1 , 2 and 3 , we found a significant difference ( p = 0.042 ) , even greater when considering 28 - day mortality ( p = 0.004 ) .
the kaplan - meier survival method showed p = 0.000 .
conclusion the mottling score was an objective reproducible system to bedside use and a good predictor of septic shock mortality .

we investigated the involvement of calcium - dependent enzymes , protein kinase c ( pkc ) and calcium - calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) , in the signaling pathway triggered by the activation of presynaptic alpha7 - type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by exogenous choline , leading to downregulation of the evoked acetylcholine ( ach ) release in mouse motor synapses .
blockade of pkc with chelerythrine neither changed the evoked release of ach by itself nor prevented the inhibitory effect of choline .
the camkii blocker kn - 62 did not affect synaptic activity but fully prevented the choline - induced downregulation of ach release .
calcium - calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ii neuromuscular synapse alpha7 - nicotinic acetylcholine receptors choline introduction choline comes from the products of the hydrolysis of acetylcholine ( ach ) neurotransmitter by acetylcholinesterase in cholinergic synapses .
along with choline reuptake into the nerve terminals where it is recycled to synthesize ach , choline plays an important role in the auto - regulation of ach release by the feedback mechanism .
this mechanism is associated with the ability of choline to selectively activate presynaptic alpha7 - type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( alpha7 - nachr ) [ 1 ] .
these receptors are abundant in central and peripheral synapses .
alpha7 - nachr permit the influx of sodium and calcium ions into the cell upon activation by choline and other agonists , leading to membrane depolarization , and also trigger diverse intracellular signaling cascades with the involvement of enzymes and channels [ 2 ] .
in addition , it has been recently established that an alpha7 - nachr molecule contains an amino acid cluster that enables a functional interaction between alpha7 - nachr and g - proteins .
this broadens the potential functions of alpha7 - nachr both as rapidly desensitizing ionotropic receptors and as special metabotropic receptors that trigger long - term signaling with long - term effects [ 3 ] .
therefore , these ambiguous consequences of presynaptic alpha7 - nachr activation in various types of synapses pose an important challenge that remains poorly studied .
we have established recently that choline ( 0.1 mm ) downregulates the evoked ach release in mouse neuromuscular synapses via ca2 + - dependent ca2 + efflux from the store through ryanodine receptors and the activation of the sk - type kca channels of terminals , resulting in downregulation of ach release [ 4 ] .
meanwhile , it was unclear whether ca2 + - dependent enzymes , such as protein kinase c ( pkc ) and / or calcium - calmodulin - dependent protein kinase type ii ( camkii ) , are involved in this cascade .
therefore , the aim of this study was to assess the changes in choline - evoked ach release in mouse motor synapses , together with the blockade of calmodulin and ca2 + - dependent enzymes , protein kinase c ( pkc ) , and calcium - calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) .
materials and methods the experiments were conducted using isolated neuromuscular preparations from the diaphragm ( m. diaphragma - n. phrenicus ) of mature ( p30 ) male mice of the 129 / sv strain provided by the anokhin institute of normal physiology , russian academy of sciences ( moscow , russia ) .
a total of 16 mice were used .
the mice were euthanized by quick decapitation .
the mice were handled in accordance with directive 86 / 609 / eec that regulates the use of laboratory animals .
the procedure was approved by the bioethics commission of the department of biology , moscow state university .
all the experiments were conducted at room temperature of 20 - 22degreesc .
dissection of the neuromuscular preparation of the left half of the diaphragm with the phrenic nerve was performed according to the earlier described standard protocol [ 4 ] .
miniature endplate potentials ( mepps ) and multiquantal endplate potentials ( epps ) upon stimulation of the phrenic nerve were recorded using intracellular glass microelectrodes filled with 2.5 m kcl ( the resistance at the microelectrode tip was 15 - 20 momega ) .
first , mepps were recorded for 100 s , followed by recording of the epps in each synapse .
the phrenic nerve was then stimulated with short trains of stimuli ( 50 stimuli 0.1 ms long each , frequency of 50 hz ) .
signals were recorded using the neuroprobe amplifier model 1600 ( a - m systems ) and recorded using an l - card e - 154 analog - to - digital converter ( with powergraph interface ) into the pc hard drive .
the data were then processed using the minianalysis software ( synaptosoft ) .
controls included mepp and epp recordings from 5 or more different synapses ; next , the substances under study were added to the perfusion solution in a particular order .
the synaptic activity was registered during 1 - 1.5 h. at least 3 neuromuscular preparations were used in each experimental series .
choline , chelerythrine ( sigma , usa ) , w - 7 , kn - 62 ( enzo life sciences , usa ) were used .
the amplitude , time parameters of mepps and epps , the mepp frequency , and the quantal content of epps were estimated ( the latter was calculated as the ratio between the mean epp amplitude corrected for non - linear summation [ 5 ] and the mean mepp amplitude ) .
the statistical significance of the difference between the sample groups was assessed using the student 's t - test and mann - whitney test .
the significance level of the differences between two sample groups was 0.05 ( n is the number of synapses studied ) .
results and discussion similar to our previous study [ 4 ] , we used a 100 - mum choline concentration to assess the presynaptic action of choline .
this concentration is close to the choline concentration in the synaptic cleft during the hydrolysis of ach and slightly exceeds the ec50 for activating alpha7 - nachr [ 6 ] .
choline significantly changed neither the membrane potential of muscle fibers nor the spontaneous mepp frequency .
the mean amplitude of mepps in the presence of choline ( 1.08 +/ - 0.09 mv ( n = 17 )) also did not change significantly compared to that of the control ( 1.05 +/ - 0.08 mv ( n = 15 ) , p > 0.05 ) .
short rhythmic stimulus trains ( 50 hz , 1 s ) led to characteristic changes in the amplitude and quantal content of epps in the train .
the short - term facilitation of the synaptic transmission was followed by a depression in the form of a decreased amplitude of epps compared to the first epp in the train , continuing into a lower stable level of epps ( and the quantal content ) compared to the first epp ( fig. 1 ) .
when pauses ( at least 2 min long ) were made between stimulus trains , the patterns of repeated trains were steadily reproduced in an individual synapse or other tested synapses .
application of choline reduced the epp amplitude in the train because of the decay in the quantal content of epps .
the quantal content of epps in the train in the presence of choline decreased significantly to 64 - 71 % compared to the control ( p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , the general pattern of the train remained unchanged ( fig. 1 ) .
the amplitude and the quantal content of epps decreased within 10 - 15 min after the administration of choline and remained at a lower level over the whole period during which choline was applied ( for 45 - 60 min ) .
the effects of pkc chelerythrine blocker the application of pkc blocker chelerythrine on the muscle ( 4 mum ) for 30 - 40 min did not significantly change the behavior of the bursting synaptic activity : neither the quantal content of epps in the train nor the train pattern ( the initial facilitation , subsequent depression , and a plateau ) changed significantly in the presence of chelerythrine ( p > 0.05 ) .
in addition , chelerythrine had no impact on the inhibitory effects of choline in terms of the epps quantal content during bursting synaptic activity ( fig. 2a ) .
therefore , ( 1 ) the ca2 + - signals that enter the terminal upon choline - induced activation of alpha7 - nachr with subsequent release of the stored calcium and ( 2 ) the possible metabotropic signaling from alpha7 - nachr coupled with gq - protein shown on other study objects [ 3 ] both do not activate pkc , and , thus pkc is not involved in the downregulation of ach release in motor synapses .
this agrees with our data and published citations showing that in motor terminals , pkc activation can be triggered by a calcium influx into the nerve endings via other ca2 + - channels , more specifically , via l - type ca2 + - channels , and also lead to the facilitation of ach release [ 7 ] .
the effects of calmodulin blocker w - 7 next , we studied the effects of choline subsequent to a preliminary inhibition of the regulatory activity of calmodulin using the w - 7 calmodulin blocker ( 10 mum ) .
the w - 7 calmodulin blocker neither had a direct influence on synaptic transmission nor influenced significantly the downregulation effect of choline on the evoked ach release .
at the same time , choline - induced downregulation of ach release in the presence of the calmodulin blocker was weaker than when only choline was added ( fig. 2b ). fig. 1 downregulation of evoked ach release by exogenous choline ( 100 mum ) during rhythmic synaptic activity with a frequency of 50 hz ( 1 s ) : a - the averaged recordings of the first ( epp1 ) and last ( epp50 ) epps in the trains in the control ( black ) and in the presence of choline ( red ) .
b - changes in the quantal content of epps during short - term rhythmic trains with a frequency of 50 hz in the control and after the addition of choline ( 100 mum ) .
the y axis shows the quantal content of epps ; the x axis shows the number of epps in the short train .
* p < 0.05 with respect to the control values effects of camkii blocker kn - 62 in the final series of the experiments , we studied the possible activation and involvement of camkii in the inhibitory effects of choline .
kn - 62 ( 3 mum ) , a selective camkii blocker , was used .
neither statistically significant increments in the mepp amplitude nor changes in the quantal content of epps in short trains were revealed during kn - 62 solution perfusion of neuromuscular preparations for 30 - 40 min .
thus , the amplitude of mepps was 0.91 +/ - 0.05 mv ( n = 20 ) in the control ; it was 0.85 +/ - 0.04 mv ( n = 23 , p > 0.05 ) in the presence of kn - 62 and was 0.83 +/ - 0.6 mv ( n = 25 ) in the presence of choline and kn - 62 .
however , in motor synapses when choline was added in the presence of preapplied kn - 62 , there was no significant decline in the amplitude and the quantal content of epps in a train compared to the control ( fig. 3 ). fig. 2 changes in the quantal content during short - term rhythmic trains of epps with a frequency of 50 hz : a - in the control , after chelerythrine ( 4 mum ) was applied and after choline ( 100 mum ) was added in the presence of preapplied chelerythrine .
b - in the control ( n = 17 ) , after application of w - 7 ( 10 mum ) ( n = 15 ) and when choline ( 100 mum ) was added in the presence of pre - applied w - 7 ( n = 18 ) .
the y axis shows the quantal content of epps ; the x axis shows the epp number in a short train .
* p < 0.05 with respect to the control values we had previously revealed a choline - induced downregulation of ach release triggered by the activation of presynaptic alpha7 - nachr , which suggests that activation of camkii can be involved in the downreg ulation of neurotransmitter release , along with other processes [ 4 ]. fig. 3 changes in the quantal content during short - term rhythmic trains of epps with a frequency of 50 hz in the control , after kn - 62 ( 3 mum ) was applied and when choline ( 100 mum ) was added in the presence of pre - applied kn - 62 .
the y axis shows the quantal content of epps , and the x axis shows the epp number in a short train external calcium influx [ 8 ] and intracellular calcium efflux [ 9 ] have been shown to activate presynaptic camkii in the terminals of central and peripheral synapses , and possible downregulating and upregulating influences of camkii activation on transmitter and cotransmitter release have been revealed [ 9 , 10 ] .
a modulation of the evoked transmitter release occurs upon the activation of alpha7 - nachr by either endogenous or exogenous choline in cns synapses .
the generation of a calcium signal was recently described in response to the influence of choline on presynaptic alpha7 - nachr in hippocampal synapses ; the calcium signals increased the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials , but the effects did not cause camkii activation and persisted in the presence of the kn - 62 blocker [ 11 ] .
we had first shown previously that in mouse peripheral synapses , the choline - induced activation of alpha7 - nachr downregulates the evoked ach transmitter release and that this downregulation can be fully prevented by the blocking of ryanodine receptors or sk - channels [ 4 ] .
this study is an important supplementation to these concepts .
camkii was also found to participate in the auto - regulation of ach release that occurs with the involvement of choline and alpha7 - nachr. with the revealed role of camkii in the auto - regulation of ach release , we can add this kinase to the already described list of enzymes that play different roles in the signal transmission following alpha7 - nachr activation in different types of cells [ 3 , 11 ] .
therefore , it is necessary to take into account the possibility of camkii activation when studying the role of alpha7 - nachr in the regulation of cellular processes .
we recently revealed camkii activation and its contribution to the enhancement of ach release during calcium influx via l - type calcium channels , and this has been so far the only example of camkii involvement in the functions of neuromuscular synapses in rodents [ 12 ] .
this study describes for the first time a fundamentally different way of camkii activation and participation in nerve end functions : i.e. , the activation of alpha7 - nachr is associated with the involvement of camkii in downregulating ach release .
the role of camkii molecules residing close to alpha7 - nachr and intraterminal calcium stores can be to enhance and prolong the calcium signal , coupled with the function of ryanodine receptors , which is necessary for the activation of sk - type potassium channels .
therefore , we have revealed for the first time a cascade of reactions in mouse motor nerve terminals that are triggered by a choline - induced activation of presynaptic alpha7 - nachr that downregulates ach release .
this cascade has been shown to rely on calcium release from stores , calcium - activated sk - type k + - channels , and the activity of the ca2 + - dependent enzyme camkii .

background nasal potential difference ( npd ) and intestinal current measurement ( icm ) are functional cftr tests that are used as adjunctive diagnostic tools for cystic fibrosis ( cf ) .
smoking has a systemic negative impact on cftr function .
a diagnostic comparison between npd and icm and the impact of smoking on both cftr tests has not been done .
methods the sweat chloride test , npd , and icm were performed in 18 patients with cf ( sweat chloride > 60 mmol / l ) , including 6 pancreatic sufficient ( ps ) patients , and 13 healthy controls , including 8 smokers .
the npd cftr response to cl - free and isoproterenol perfusion ( delta0cl - + iso ) was compared to the icm cftr response to forskolin / ibmx , carbachol , and histamine ( deltaisc , forskolin / ibmx + carbachol + histamine ) .
results the mean npd cftr response and icm cftr response between patients with cf and healthy controls was significantly different ( p < 0.001 ) , but not between patients with cf who were ps and those who were pancreatic insufficient ( pi ) .
smokers have a decreased cftr response measured by npd ( p = 0.049 ) .
for icm there is a trend towards decreased cftr response ( ns ) .
three healthy control smokers had npd responses within the cf - range .
in contrast to npd , there was no overlap of the icm response between patients with cf and controls .
conclusions icm is superior to npd in distinguishing between patients with cf who have a sweat chloride > 60 mmol / l and healthy controls , including smokers .
neither npd nor icm differentiated between patients with cf who were ps from those who were pi. smoking has a negative impact on cftr function in healthy controls measured by npd and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of npd , but not icm .

keywords ( 3 - 10 ) : cystic fibrosis nasal potential difference intestinal current measurement sweat chloride sweat test diagnosis smoking issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background cystic fibrosis ( cf ) is diagnosed based on a defined clinical phenotype and confirmation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( cftr ) dysfunction , commonly demonstrated by a sweat chloride value of >= 60 mmol / l and / or detection of two cf - causing mutations [ 1 , 2 ] .
a small but increasing number of patients present with clinical symptoms characteristic of cf , an intermediate ( 30 - 60 mmol / l ) or negative (<= 29 mml / l ) sweat test , and less than two cf - causing mutations [ 3 - 6 ] .
for these query cf patients , a specific and sensitive cftr functional test to exclude or confirm a cftr functional defect characteristic of cf is needed [ 1 , 6 ] .
cftr modulating and correcting drugs have improved cftr - function in cell cultures [ 7 ] .
to test their effect in cf - patients , especially those with rare mutations , cftr - functional tests with low variability and high reproducibility are needed [ 7 ] .
in addition to sweat testing , two additional cftr functional tests have been developed over the past 30 years ; nasal potential difference ( npd ) measurement [ 8 ] and intestinal current measurement ( icm ) [ 9 ] .
cftr function is measured in vivo in the respiratory epithelium by npd and ex vivo in superficial rectal biopsies by icm .
international standard operating procedures ( sops ) have been established for both tests [ 8 , 10 ] .
both tests block epithelial sodium channels by amiloride and stimulate camp - mediated cftr - mediated chloride transport in chloride - free solution and isoproterenol ( npd ) or forskolin and ibmx ( icm ) .
in addition , cholinergic chloride transport is tested by carbachol with icm .
the change after chloride - free and isoproterenol perfusion ( delta0cl - + iso ) with npd [ 8 ] and the sum of the responses after carbachol , forskolin / ibmx ([ 11 ]) plus histamine ( deltaisc , forskolin / ibmx + carbachol + histamine ) with icm [ 12 ] has been proposed to be the best parameter of cftr function .
both techniques can discriminate cf patients from healthy controls ( npd [ 13 , 14 ] ; icm [ 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 ]) , but comparative clinical trials are lacking .
smoking has a systemic negative impact on cftr - function [ 17 , 18 ] , but the impact on the diagnostic aspects of npd and icm have not been investigated .
we performed npd and icm measurement in cf - patients and healthy controls to determine ( 1 ) the ability of these measurements to differentiate cf patients from healthy controls , and ( 2 ) the influence of smoking on cftr function in healthy controls .
methods between october 2012 and february 2013 , 18 patients with cf and 13 healthy controls were recruited at the justus - liebig - university , giessen , germany .
for this study , the diagnosis of cf was based on at least one clinical manifestation of cf , sweat chloride >= 60 mmol / l and the presence of two cf - causing mutations [ 1 ] .
pancreatic sufficiency ( ps ) was defined as fecal elastase > 100 mug / g stool .
healthy controls had no clinical manifestation of cf and a sweat chloride value < 60 mmol / l ( non - cf ) .
smoking was defined as any active or passive exposure to tobacco smoke .
exclusion criteria were participation in another medical clinical trial during the past 30 days , acute respiratory symptoms , intake of ivacaftor , known hemorrhoids , or bleeding diathesis .
the ethics committee of the justus - liebig - universitat giessen approved the protocol ( az109 / 12 ) .
the study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
written informed consent was obtained from each participant aged 18 years and older .
for participants younger than 18 years of age , written informed consent was obtained from each participant 's parents or legal guardian , and age - appropriate consent was obtained from each participant .
the sweat test , npd , and icm were performed on the same day for each subject .
the sweat test was performed according to clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines [ 19 ] .
for sweat stimulation and collection , the macroduct ( r ) system ( wescor , inc. , logan , usa ) was used .
chloride was measured by chloride titration .
a sweat chloride level >= 60 mmol / l was interpreted as within the cf range , 30 - 60 mmol / l as equivocal , and <= 29 mmol as normal [ 1 ] .
npd was performed by one operator who was accredited by the cystic fibrosis foundations' ( cff ) therapeutic developments network ( tdn ) , and followed the cff tdn sop ( version : january 2009 ) [ 8 ] .
we used terbutaline as a substitute for isoproterenol in accordance with the sop .
the chloride - free and isoproterenol response ( delta0cl - + iso ) ( npd cftr response ) and the wilschanksi score ( defined as e ( response to chloride - free and isoproterenol / response to amiloride )) [ 20 ] representing the cftr response were calculated as the average or best result from both nostrils .
the delta0cl - + iso was interpreted as normal when < - 12 mv , as in the cf range when > - 7.7 mv , and as equivocal for results between - 12 and - 7.7 mv [ 6 ] .
the wilschanski score was interpreted as normal (< 0.65 ) , in the cf - range (> 0.70 ) , or equivocal ( 0.65 - 0.70 ) [ 20 ] .
if the mean delta0cl - + iso was > - 7.7 mv in healthy controls , the npd was repeated on a different day .
only the measurement with the highest delta0cl - + iso was reported .
if both measurements confirmed a delta0cl - + iso in the cf range , cftr genotyping ( sequencing and multiplex ligation - dependent probe amplification ) was offered as part of the participant 's clinical care and reported as part of the baseline data .
genotyping of all healthy controls was not ethically approved .
the icm followed the european cystic fibrosis society - therapeutic development network ( ecfs - tdn ) sop ( v2.7 ; oct 26 , 2011 ) , which is based on the rotterdam protocol .
the tissues sliders ( p2407c [ 1.5 mm diameter aperture slider ; area 0,018 cm2 ] or p2407b [ 1.2 mm diameter aperture slider ; area 0.011 cm2 ] ; physiologic instruments , san diego , usa ) were mounted without tissue in the chambers ( 4 - chamber system [ em - lvsys - 4 ; physiologic instrument , san diego , usa ]) , which were filled on both sides with 2 ml meyler buffer solution ( 10 mm hepes ; 0.3 mm na2hpo4 ; 0.4 mm nah2po4 ; 1.0 mm mgcl2 ; 1.3 mm cacl2 ; 4.7 mm kcl ; 128 mm nacl ; 20.2 mm nahco3 ; 10 mm d - glucose ; 0.01 mm indomethacin ; ph 7.4 ; osmolarity 300 mosm ) .
powerlab ( 4 / 30 ; adinstruments ltd. , dunedin , new zealand ) and labchart ( r ) software ( release 7.2 ; adinstruments ltd. , dunedin , new zealand ) were used for data acquisition .
a stable open potential difference ( pd ) was ensured and an input offset to 0 mv was performed .
fluid resistance compensation was performed by applying short current pulses ( 15 mua ) by the vcc mc4s multi - channel voltage current clamp ( physiologic instrument , san diego , usa ) and adjusting the fluid resistance .
for icm , at least 4 superficial rectal biopsies were obtained by suction biopsies ( aspiration biopsy instrument according to wilital ( ue7605 ) ; ulrich gmbh , ulm , germany ) without prior bowel preparation .
biopsies were immediately stored in ice - cold buffer solution ( dulbecco 's phosphate buffered saline and indomethacin , final concentration 10 mum ) and mounted on adequate tissue sliders .
after mounting the sliders in the heated and slightly sparged ( 95 % o2 / 5 % co2 ) 4 - chamber system , each basal resistance was measured by applying short current pulses ( 15 mua ) and registering the corresponding change in vt ( typical range 15 - 30 ohm x cm2 ) with the vcc mc4s multi - channel voltage current clamp ( physiologic instrument , san diego , usa ) .
after that the voltage was clamped at 0 mv and the raw short circuit current ( risc ) was recorded from then on. due to different sliders with different areas ( p2407c [ 1.5 mm diameter aperture slider ; area 0.018 cm2 ] or p2407b [ 1.2 mm diameter aperture slider ; area 0.011 cm2 ]) ; physiologic instruments , san diego , usa ) , the raw risc was converted to isc ( mua / cm2 ) .
after applying 100 mum carbachol ( which stimulates cholinergic cl - secretion by opening basolateral k + channels ) to the serosal compartment , an isc response was evoked for quality control of the biopsy .
after a 40 - min equilibration in meyler buffer , the basal isc was noted and 2 mul amiloride ( to block amiloride - sensitive sodium channels ) was added to the mucosal compartment .
after 5 min or when the isc was stable , 10 mum forskolin and 100 mum ibmx ( to stimulate camp - dependent cftr - cl - transport ) were added to the mucosal and serosal compartments ( deltaisc , forskolin / ibmx ) .
after a minimum of 10 min , 10 mum genisteine ( cftr - potentiator ) was added to both compartments .
after a minimum of 5 min , 100 mum carbachol was added to the serosal compartment ( deltaisc , carbachol ) .
after a minimum of 10 min , 200 mum 4,4 ' - diisothiocyano - 2,2 ' - stilbenedisulfonic acid ( dids ) ( blocking non - cftr - cl - channels ) was added to the mucosal compartment .
after 10 min , 500 mum histamine ( to stimulate ca2 + and proteinkinase c - mediated cftr cl - secretion ) was added to the serosal compartment ( deltaisc , histamine ) .
in the open circuit , the final transepithelial voltage and final resistance were measured by applying short current pulses as in the beginning .
preliminary data suggested that the average deltaisc , forskolin / ibmx + carbachol + histamine is the best diagnostic icm parameter for chloride secretory response ( icm cftr response ) , but reference ranges have not been established [ 10 ] .
data are presented as the mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) ( normally distributed variables ) , respective the median values , and 25th and 75th percentiles ( non - normally distributed variables ) .
group comparisons were performed using the student 's t test or mann - whitney u test for normally or non - normally distributed variables , respectively .
statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 .
all analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics 21 ( release 21 ; ibm , armonk , usa ) .
results our study included 18 patients with cf and 13 healthy controls with a median age of 20.5 and 25.0 years , respectively ( ns ) ( table 1 ) .
as consequence of our inclusion criteria , sweat chloride values distinguish patients with cf from healthy controls ( p < 0.001 ) .
although the mean sweat chloride differed between cf - ps and cf - pi patients ( p = 0.003 ) , an individual overlap occurs ( table 1 , figure 1 ) .
the mean npd cftr response significantly discriminated between cf patients and healthy controls ( p < 0.001 ) , but not between patients with cf who were ps versus pi ( table 1 ) .
four healthy controls had an average delta0cl - + iso of > - 7.7 mv. three out of four controls had a repeatable average npd cftr response in the cf - range for delta0cl - + iso > - 7.7 mv ( 23 % of all healthy controls ) ( figure 1 ) , and two additional controls when using the wilschanski score ( 15 % of all healthy controls ) ( figure 2 ) .
all these healthy controls were smokers .
cftr genotyping was offered to these three healthy controls as part of clinical routine and none had two cf - causing mutations ( table 1 ) .
for icm a median of 6 ( 5 - 7 ) rectal biopsies were sampled per patient without severe adverse events .
the mean icm cftr response was significantly different between cf patients and healthy controls ( p < 0.001 ) , but not between patients with cf who were ps versus those who were pi ( table 1 ) .
we could not detect any age - dependency of the response to isoproterenol / forskolin .
in contrast to npd , there was no overlap between cf - patients and controls ( figures 3 and 4 ) .
using the best instead of the average npd , the cftr response overlap did not change ( additional file 1 ) .
using the best instead of the average icm , the cftr response resulted in one overlap ( additional file 2 ) .

in healthy controls , smoking had no influence on sweat chloride ( ns ) , but decreased cftr function as measured by npd ( p = 0.049 ) ( table 2 and figure 5 ) , and resulted in intermediate or even abnormal npd results , but not icm or sweat chloride results .
there is a trend in icm measurements indicative that smoking might not only affect cftr in the respiratory tract , but also in the intestine ( table 2 and figure 6 ) .

discussion icm is superior to npd for distinguishing between cf patients with a sweat chloride > 60 mmol / l and healthy controls , including smokers .
neither npd nor icm differentiated patients with cf who were ps from those who were pi. smoking has a negative impact on cftr function in healthy controls measured by npd , and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of npd .
there is a trend in icm indicative that smoking might not only affect cftr in the respiratory tract , but also in the intestine , which has no impact on diagnostic interpretation .
npd has been used as a diagnostic test for cf since the late 1980s [ 14 , 21 , 22 ] .
studies have shown 94.8 - 100 % sensitivity and 96.5 - 100 % specificity of delta0cl - + iso for separating pi patients with cf from healthy controls [ 13 , 14 , 23 ] .
experience with a broader spectrum of patients with cf [ 24 , 25 ] and equivocal patients ( sweat chloride < 60 mmol / l and less than two cf - causing mutations ) [ 20 ] described a clinically relevant overlap for delta0cl - + iso .
even in f508del homozygous patients , a residual cftr npd response with [ 26 ] or without [ 27 , 28 ] an observed clinical difference has been described .
some centers introduced an intermediate category for delta0cl - + iso [ 6 ] , interpret the highest npd cftr response [ 29 ] , or use a composite score that includes sodium and chloride conductance [ 20 , 30 ] .
irrespective of the diagnostic criteria , our result showed a clinically relevant overlap between patients with cf and healthy controls .
a normal average npd cftr response excludes cf , but an abnormal average npd cftr response could occur in healthy controls , especially in smokers , and can lead to a false - positive diagnosis of cf. a repeated measurement of a pathologic npd response reduced the false - positive results in 1 out of 4 healthy controls in our cohort and should be recommended as a standard approach .
icm was developed as a research tool for cftr function in the 1990s [ 31 ] and has been used as a diagnostic test since the early 2000s [ 15 , 32 ] .
two different protocols are established ; the freiburg protocol [ 9 ] and the original [ 33 ] and adapted [ 34 ] rotterdam protocol .
we used the newest ecfs - icm - sop , which is an adapted rotterdam protocol .
the combination of camp - mediated cl - secretion , and the carbachol and histamine ( rotterdam protocol ) responses separate patients with cf from those without cf [ 11 , 12 , 34 ] , but not patients with cf who are ps from those who are pi [ 11 , 12 ] , which is in accordance with our results .
the 50 % loss of cftr protein in cf heterozygotes could not be detected by icm [ 35 ] independent of the protocol [ 15 , 32 ] .
for the rotterdam protocol , de jonge postulated that the icm response is not proportional to the cftr amount in the apical membrane of coloncytes except at a low level (< 10 - 15 %) and could therefore only detect an 80 - 85 % loss of cftr expression / function [ 32 ] .
therefore , mild mutations could result in a false - negative icm .
interestingly , derichs reported 8 patients with a sweat chloride > 60 mmol / l , fewer than two cf - causing mutations after sequencing , and a normal icm response who were judged as cf unlikely [ 12 ] .
our results with the new ecfs - icm sop confirm the high predictive value and practicability of this adapted icm rotterdam protocol .
our data suggest that npd is more likely to detect cftr dysfunction in healthy controls than the icm or sweat test .
this could be explained by tissue specific differences in cftr expression , alternative chloride channel expression , or extrinsic factors .
kalin et al. showed identical cftr expression in the respiratory and intestinal tract of f508del - homozygous patients and healthy controls [ 36 ] .
highly variable cftr expression in the nose [ 37 ] and colon [ 38 ] of f508del homozygous patients has been described , varying from 0 - 100 % [ 37 ] .
therefore , in the respiratory and intestinal tract , individual cftr expression seems to be more relevant than tissue specific expression .
alternative chloride channels could contribute to the chloride conductance , but have not been described in the distal colon [ 39 ] .
furthermore , previous infections [ 40 ] , milder trauma [ 14 ] , smoking [ 17 ] , increased paracellular permeability [ 41 ] , and decreased cftr expression [ 42 ] and cftr response [ 43 ]. with the exception of smoking , these extrinsic factors are relevant only for npd , but not for rectal biopsies [ 44 ] .
smoking causes a decreased npd response [ 17 ] , but although a decreased systemic cftr function mediated by acrolein [ 18 ] .
raju et al. demonstrated a 65 % decrease in the icm cftr response in healthy smokers compared with non - smokers [ 18 ] .
our results confirm these findings .
in contrast to npd , smoking did not influence the diagnostic cut - off for icm in our cohort .
therefore , icm seems to be a more robust diagnostic test than npd to distinguish primary from secondary cftr dysfunction .
this is important for the interpretation of npd as an adjunctive diagnostic test in patients with query - cf who are exposed to smoking .
limitations of our study include the small number of participants in each group , the lack of patients with cf with a sweat chloride value < 60 mmol / l , and patients with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens ( cbavd ) .
the strength of our study is the genotyping of healthy controls with an abnormal cftr npd response , and the use of standardized protocols for sweat testing , npd , and icm .
conclusions from our results , a normal average npd cftr response excludes cf , but an intermediate or abnormal npd cftr response could be detected in healthy controls .
npd should be judged carefully , especially in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and exposure to smoking .
icm combined with camp - mediated and cholinergic cl secretion seems to be a practicable diagnostic test with an increased specificity compared with npd .
discordant results of both cftr functional tests could be detected and challenge the diagnostic interpretation .
larger study groups that include smokers and patients with cbavd or cf with a sweat chloride between 30 - 60 mmol / l are needed to confirm our results .

methods : a population survey was conducted in tehran during 2012 , within which a total of 8626 participants were enrolled .
the cluster sampling was used to draw samples in 100 clusters with a pre - specified cluster size of 25 households per cluster .
data were collected on demographic features , accident and injury characteristics based on the international classification of diseases ( icd10 ) .
results : a total of 618 injuries per 3 months were reported , within which 597 cases ( 96.6 %) were unintentional injuries .
more than 82 % of all injuries were those caused by exposure to inanimate mechanical forces , traffic accidents , falls and burns .
above 80 % of the traffic injuries happened among men ( p < 0.001 ) .
about 43 % of the unintentional injuries were mild injuries.after the age of 40 , women , unlike men , had higher risks for being injured .
the estimated annual incidence rate for all types of injuries was 284.8 per 1000 ( 95 % ci : 275.4 - 294.4 ) and for unintentional injuries was 275.2 per 1000 .
conclusion : injuries are major health problems in tehran with a highly reported incidence .
the status is not substantially improved over the recent years which urges the need to be adequately and emergently addressed .
as the incidence rate was estimated based on participant recalls , the real incidence rate may even be higher than those reported in the current study .

introduction among the most challenging problems ahead of health policy makers and political leaders is decreasing the burden of injuries .
injuries often result in either death or a major deterioration of quality of life among the survivors .
a majority of this burden belongs to low and middle income countries ( lmics ) , despite its high priority for high income countries.1,2 compared to other injuries , road traffic injuries ( rtis ) are of higher importance in iran .
in this country , after ischemic heart diseases ( 9.1 %) and low back pain ( 9 %) , rtis ( 7.3 %) are considered as the third major contributor to disability adjusted life years ( dalys ) .
in iran , similar to the global status , rtis in both genders are the first cause of mortality among 15 - 49 years old population.3,4 regardless to the large similarity of lmics in injury burden , the magnitude and epidemiological characteristics of injuries in lmics are difficult to establish which may be due to the lack of valid and representative data.5,6 a majority of literature in the field of injuries in iran is originated from hospital based studies .
in order to capture the overall epidemiologic pattern of injuries there is a need for repeated population - based studies which are rarely available in iran and many lmics .
tehran is the capital of iran with a population more than 8.8 million .
tehran is the third largest city in the middle east , after cairo and istanbul .
the most recent population - based study in tehran was conducted in 2008.7 this study seemed to be the most recent comprehensive population - based general injury survey prior to the present study .
although several injury specific surveys have been conducted including a much recent work by the same authors.8 tehran municipality started tehran safe community program to evaluate the impact of its activities , to find a baseline survey and to map out the epidemiology of injuries in tehran metropolitan .
there is an urgent need for investigating the effectiveness of community - based interventions with the hope to conduct a baseline assessment of the prevalence of various injuries before interventions .
such assessments have not been seriously considered in safe community interventions in many lmics and iran,9,10 as well .
as , before the safe community movement in capital of iran , no comprehensive study was found in the literature to depict the epidemiological pattern of injuries in tehran , the current survey was conducted to explore descriptive epidemiology of injuries in tehran in 2012 and to report the recalled estimates of injury incidence rates .
materials and methods study population and sampling this cross - sectional population survey was conducted in tehran , during 6 months in 2012 .
the households who were willing to participate in the study were considered eligible to be enrolled in the survey .
cluster sampling was used to draw samples in 100 clusters of the households in tehran district with a pre - specified 25 households per cluster .
considering an average family size of 3.4 per household in tehran , a total of 8500 samples were assumed to be recruited .
the sample size was estimated based on : injury occurrence = 3 % , acceptable accuracy = 0.5 % , the confidence level = 95 % , design effect = 1.8 and a potential attrition rate = 5 % .
clusters were selected based on a probability proportional to size ( pps ) using the national census 2011 database .
the addresses for the selected households were extracted .
after determining the start point to initiate the survey in each cluster , consecutive households were enrolled following the right - hand rule to capture 25 residential locations .
no institutional participants were enrolled .
data collection data collection was conducted by trained interviewers most of whom had a bachelor degree .
prior to the beginning of survey , the interviewers participated in a training session to learn about the research plan and their duties throughout the survey .
the survey process was well described and the interviewers were supplied with the data collection package and the printed maps of the addresses .
in the session , the data collection tools were reviewed in detail and all possible questions were answered to remove ambiguities .
besides , they were provided with a 12 - page guideline providing full description of the questionnaires for their potential future referrals .
a supervisory team was also trained who participated both in the training session for the interviewers and in a separate training session for monitoring the data collection process .
then , a pilot interview was planned in a test location through which each interviewer interviewed two households .
a day later , they came back to a discussion room where they described their experiences and raised possible questions they might had .
this was planned to reduce the interrater variability of the assessments .
a questionnaire for interview was developed , evaluated and improved to be used as data collection tool in this survey .
this data collection tool was developed to collect the survey data elements recommended by the world health organization ( who ) guidelines for conducting community surveys on injuries and violence .
this questionnaire was developed according to the who framework for conducting community safety surveys .
the main data collected in this survey included demographic data , accident occurrence data and injury - related data such as injury mechanism , injured body organ , activity type while injured and injury place .
injury - related data were collected based on the classifications determined in the international classification of diseases ( icd10 ) .
the socioeconomic status was assessed as applying a valid and reliable instrument called the sesiran socioeconomic status tool.11,12 the total direct costs for medical care received by the injured participants were also recorded ( in iranian rials ) based on the patients' self - reports .
data were analyzed using stata version 13 statistical software package .
descriptive statistics such as frequencies and relative frequencies as well as means and standard deviations were reported .
results in the present study , a total of 2498 households out of 2500 pre - specified cases were investigated ( response rate = 99 %) .
a total of 8626 household members were surveyed .
the sample included 4359 ( 50.6 %) male and 4260 ( 49.4 %) female participants .
children comprised 5.7 % of the subjects followed by older adults , forming 8.9 % of all enrolled participants .
figure 1 presents age distribution among male and female respondents .
a total of 618 injuries per 3 months were reported , within which 597 ( 96.6 %) cases were unintentional injuries .
the annual generalized incidence rates for various sex - age groups are shown in figure 2 .
after the age of 40 , compared to other age groups , the women had higher risks to be injured and this risk was the highest after the age of 50 .
this trend , however , was slightly decreasing among men .
the estimated annual incidence rate for all type of injuries was 284.8 per 1000 ( 95 % ci : 275.4 - 294.4 ) .
the estimated annual incidence rate for unintentional injuries was 275.2 per 1000 ( 95 % ci : 265.8 - 284.6 ) .
more than 82 % of the injuries were caused by exposure to inanimate mechanical forces followed by traffic accidents , falls and burns .
a significant difference was observed in injury mechanisms by gender , in a way that above 80 % of the traffic injuries were happened among men ( p < 0.001 ) ( table 1 ) .
among unintentional injuries , the mild injuries comprised 43 % of the injuries followed by burns ( 14 %) , fractures ( 13 %) , open wounds ( 11.6 %) , and sprains , strains and subluxations ( 7.2 %) .
upper and lower limbs were the most common organs involved in the injuries ( figure 3 ) .
the accident economic loss was reported in iranian rials ( irrs ) .
mean and median costs were 13 622 030 and 3 500 000 irrs , respectively .
mean medical costs of the injuries was 8 605 767 irrs with a median cost of 1 000 000 irrs ( sd = 2 670 8870 irrs , iqr = 3 500 000 irrs ) .
the most common place of injuries in nearly half of the accidents was home , followed by roads ( 30 %) .
types of activities distribution at the time of accidents and the accidents' place are illustrated in table 2 .
about one - third ( 213 ) of the injured participants had received medical care for their injury .
during the first medical referral , 138 ( 64.5 %) cases referred to hospital , 27 ( 12.6 %) cases referred to medical clinics , 25 ( 11.7 %) cases referred to public health centers , 17 ( 7.9 %) cases referred to general practitioners and the remaining referred to the paces other than the formal health system , such as traditional care givers , bonesetters and pharmacists .
about 105 of the injured participants had a second medical referral , within which 94 % referred to hospitals , medical clinics and general practitioners .
forty - three subjects had a third referral , among which 80 % had hospital referrals .
the current life activities ( such as attending work , school and recreation activities ) of 26.9 % of the individuals were affected by the injury .
the injury led to losing job in 3 ( 1.4 %) subjects who were employed prior to their accident .
among 223 injured participants who were employed or were students , 59 ( 26.5 %) cases had at least one working day lost from their work or university .
mean and median days lost were 16.1 and 7 days , respectively ( sd = 22.9 : iqr = 17 ) .
the injury had caused total disability in one case and four other cases had permanent single organ disability .
only one mortality was reported who was a 71 - year - old man died in hospital after a traffic accident .
discussion a major portion of injuries in our study comprised the minor injuries .
this is quite reasonable due to the sensitivity of population - based surveys in mapping the epidemiology of injuries , even for minor injuries .
in a prior similar study conducted in tehran in 2007 to 2008 , similar proportion was observed for minor injuries.7,13 however , the rate of minor injuries had a higher proportion in the present study compared to those mentioned in previous studies .
in the present study in order to reduce the possibility of recall bias for minor injuries , we investigated the recall for injuries over 3 - month periods rather than the 12 - month recall as conducted in the earlier studies .
the best estimation , however , could be provided only in prospective data collection strategies .
a previous study on burn injuries with a prospective design over a 12 - month period showed that minor burns comprised 95 % of all burns,14 which was in contrast to those found in the studies conducted in clinical settings and even cross - sectional population surveys .
although minor injuries have a lower level of importance in terms of health outcome , the risk situation causing a minor injury may not be very different from that in a severe injury , in many instances .
in the present study , the incidence of injury in tehran was higher than the estimates reported earlier .
more than 82 % of all injuries were due to four main mechanisms : exposure to inanimate mechanical forces , traffic accidents , falls and burns .
although the overall pattern of the injuries were similar to those reported in 2008 , in our study exposure to inanimate mechanical forces were the leading cause of injuries which is contrary to the finding reported in 2008 , within which rtis were found to be the most common type of injury .
regardless the possibility of change in the patterns of injury occurrence , it is supposed that the difference between the findings in our study and those reported in 2008 may be due to the higher sensitivity of current study in detecting minor injuries , which may have a different pattern from severe injuries .
similarly , when comparing the incidence rates , the higher injury rates in the present study was mainly explained by higher sensitivity of current study in detecting minor injuries using a 3 - month recall versus 12 - month recall in previous studies which may claim bias towards underestimating the minor injuries .
however , a less likely assumption may be the increased rate of injury incidence which is not in line with the available evidence.15 age has always been a matter of interest in injury research such that some age groups contribute to majority of the injury burden .
for example traffic injuries were reported to be the leading cause of death in 15 - 29 years age group.16 - 18 moreover , the largest absolute increases in the global total rate of years of life with disabilities ( ylds ) were shown to lie between the ages of 40 and 69.19 in present study , women after the age of 40 were at higher risks of being injured .
this risk was the highest at the 50th decade of their age .
this trend however was slightly decreasing among men .
in a population survey in germany , it was similarly found that injury incidence rate in the adulthood was sharply decreasing by age among men but this rate for women was constant by their age .
the difference in the population pyramids should be taken into account when comparing the rates not standardized to a reference population.20 saadat et al also found a similar pattern for the injury incidence rate by age for men .
in their study , a very sharp increase was reported in the injury incidence rate at the seventh decade of age which could mostly be attributed to the imprecision , because only 11 people were injured in this age group with a substantially wide confidence interval of annual incidence rate.7 in an italian study that was based on emergency department data , both genders had similar distributions in injury incidence rate up to 41 - 50 years of age , followed by an increasing rate among women and a decreasing rate among men at the higher ages.21 although , the lower rates reported in high income countries may be explained by the real lower rates than those reported in iran , as a developing country , we believe in higher sensitivity of detecting injuries through shorter time recall period in tehran , except for the traffic injuries which is a real catastrophic event in iran.15,20 - 26 in the present study , the injuries caused by exposure to inanimate mechanical forces followed by traffic accidents , falls and burns comprised more than 82 % of all injuries .
home was the most common place of injury , except for rtis which are intrinsically known to be occurred in traffic environment .
this pattern was similar to many previous studies.7,8,27,28 home has the fame to be a safe haven by most people .
however , it can be a dangerous place where injuries are frequently occurred .
different injury prevention programs may be needed at homes which should be closely in accordance with evidence to improve the efficiency of home safety promotion programs.5,6 the present study was a population survey and showed that the incidence of injury in tehran was higher than the estimates driven from hospital - based studies .
contrary to the hospital - based studies , our study was conducted to assess the incidence rates of injuries regardless of their fatality or severity.29 because not all the injuries are admitted to hospitals , and some cases are referred to peripheral clinics and some cases even do not seek for medical services .
we concluded that injuries are major health problems in tehran with a highly reported incidence rate that is not substantially improved over the recent years when compared to the latest reliable findings .
as the incidence rate in the present study was based on participant recalls , the real incidence may even be more than those reported in the current study .
although the sudden nature of injuries makes it possible to assess the incidence of injuries through recall citations while conducting cross - sectional population - based surveys , this is always subject to underestimation of the incidence rate due to recall limitations .
such a limitation is not an exception to the current study .
in order to reduce this effect in the present study , the recall period was restricted to three months .
nevertheless , it should be taken into account that the real incidence rate could even be higher than the observed incidence .
as current study was not specifically developed for economic assessment purposes and the recorded costs were just based on self - reports , the results related to injury costs should be cautiously interpreted , especially taking into account that the potential underestimation of costs are more likely to occur .

background angiogenesis is a key process for tumor progression and a target for treatment .
however , the regulation of breast cancer angiogenesis and its relevance for clinical resistance to antiangiogenic drugs is still incompletely understood .
recent developments on the contribution of microrna to tumor angiogenesis and on the oncogenic effects of mir - 17 - 92 , a mirna cluster , point to their potential role on breast cancer angiogenesis .
the aim of this work was to establish the contribution of mir - 20a , a member of mir - 17 - 92 cluster , to tumor angiogenesis in patients with invasive breast carcinoma .
methods tube - formation in vitro assays with conditioned medium from mcf7 and mda - mb - 231 breast cancer cell lines were performed after transfection with mir - 20a and anti - mir20a .
for clinical validation of the experimental findings , we performed a retrospective analysis of a series of consecutive breast cancer patients ( n = 108 ) treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and with a full characterization of their vessel pattern and expression of angiogenic markers in pre - treatment biopsies .
expression of members of the cluster mir - 17 - 92 and of angiogenic markers was determined by rt - qpcr after rna purification from ffpe samples .
results in vitro angiogenesis assays with endothelial cells and conditioned media from breast cancer cell lines showed that transfection with anti - mir20a in mda - mb - 231 significantly decreased mean mesh size and total mesh area , while transfection with mir - 20a in mcf7 cells increased mean mesh size .
mir - 20a angiogenic effects were abrogated by treatment with aflibercept , a vegf trap .
these results were supported by clinical data showing that mir - 20a expression was higher in tumors with no estrogen receptor or with more extensive nodal involvement ( cn2 - 3 ) .
a higher mir - 20a expression was associated with higher mean vessel size ( p = 0.015 ) and with an angiogenic pattern consisting in larger vessels , higher vegfa expression and presence of glomeruloid microvascular proliferations ( p < 0.001 ) .
this association was independent of tumor subtype and vegfa expression .
conclusions transfection of breast cancer cells with mir - 20a induces vascular changes in endothelial tube - formation assays .
expression of mir - 20a in breast invasive carcinomas is associated with a distinctive angiogenic pattern consisting in large vessels , anomalous glomeruloid microvascular proliferations and high vegfa expression .
our results suggest a role for mir - 20a in the regulation of breast cancer angiogenesis , and raise the possibility of its use as an angiogenic biomarker .

introduction breast cancer is the main cause of cancer - related mortality among women from developed countries .
although its prognosis has improved in recent years , with five - year survival over 80 % , development of distant metastasis occurs in around 30 % of cases after treatment with surgery and adjuvant systemic therapy [ 1 ] .
new and improved treatments are now available for both early and metastatic breast cancer , but more active targeted therapies are still needed for women with breast cancer .
tumor angiogenesis , one of the hallmarks of cancer , is a key process for tumor progression and metastases .
a vast amount of clinical and experimental data has demonstrated the prognostic relevance and the biological implications of angiogenic activation in breast cancer .
in particular , vegfa ( vascular and endothelial growth factor a ) has a key role in breast cancer progression , through its effects on tumor angiogenesis , and also through its autocrine functions in migration , invasion and survival of breast cancer cells [ 2 ] .
an association of vegfa expression with early recurrence and worse survival of breast cancer has been previously demonstrated , although current data do not support the use of vegfa levels as a biomarker for guiding antiangiogenic therapy [ 3,4 ] .
partly due to the lack of validated biomarkers , the true impact of therapeutic strategies targeting angiogenesis for breast cancer has been below the initial expectations [ 5,6 ] .
the introduction of antiangiogenic drugs in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting , corresponding to earlier stages of breast cancer , has also rendered poor results , although more studies are needed [ 7,8 ] .
additionally , modulation of tumor angiogenesis by conventional chemotherapy , with potential synergistic and antagonistic effects , further confounds the interpretation of clinical results .
in fact , others and we have demonstrated that chemotherapy exerts variable changes in tumor vascular network , which are clearly related neither to pathologic response nor to patients outcome [ 9 - 11 ] .
a major problem for understanding the limited antiangiogenic effects of antiangiogenic therapy for breast cancer is the lack of validated predictive biomarkers .
besides the highly variable results with circulating biomarkers , the impact of angiogenesis - targeted drugs and chemotherapy on the usual markers of angiogenesis , such as microvessel density ( mvd ) or vascular endothelial growth factor a ( vegfa ) expression has been inconsistent in the clinical setting [ 12,13 ] .
some translational studies suggest that vascular characteristics , related to vessel size and morphology , are associated with prognostic differences in breast cancer .
specifically , a higher vascular size and complexity , experimentally linked to thrombospondin and vegfa changes , seem to confer a worse prognosis in breast cancer , as others and we have shown before [ 9,14 ] .
in particular , we have previously characterized a bad - prognosis vegfa - related angiogenic profile characterized by a higher mean vascular size ( mvs ) and by the presence of glomeruloid microvascular proliferation ( gmp ) , but without increased microvascular density ( mvd ) .
this vascular profile is associated to high expression of vegfa [ 9 ] .
the regulation of angiogenesis in breast cancer depends , as in other malignant neoplasms , on a complex network of interactions between stromal and tumor cells , which modifies endothelial cell function and the levels of pro - and anti - angiogenic factors in the tumor microenvironment .
in the current active search for unveiling angiogenesis mechanisms , recent data support the potential role of microrna in the regulation of tumor angiogenic balance [ 15,16 ] .
microrna are short rna chains that regulate gene expression either by inhibition or degradation of mrna or by direct interference with protein translation .
several mirna are able to target pro - angiogenic or anti - angiogenic mediators both in the tumor and endothelial cells , as well as in other cells of the peritumoral stroma .
in particular , the cluster mir - 17 - 92 , also known as oncomir - 1 for its oncogenic effects , is expressed in breast cancer , with a higher expression in hormone receptor ( er ) negative tumors .
the highly conserved polycistronic cluster mir - 17 - 92 includes six different mature mirnas ( mir - 17 , mir - 18a , mir - 19a , mir - 19b , mir - 20a and mir - 92a ) , and there are also two paralog clusters ( mir - 106b - 363 and mir - 106b - 25 ) .
according to seed sequences , three families have been defined : mir - 17 ( mir - 17 , mir - 20a , mir - 18a ) , mir - 19 ( mir - 19a and mir - 19b ) and mir - 92 .
the expression of mir - 17 - 92 depends , at least partially , on oncogenes myc and kras , and is also related to estrogen receptor ( er ) pathway in breast carcinomas .
some members of the cluster induce pro - angiogenic effects , while other mirnas may show different actions , probably depending of the cell context , but experimental data in lymphoma [ 17 ] and other tumors support a predominantly pro - angiogenic effect [ 18,19 ] .
several validated targets ( thbs1 or thrombospondin 1 , vegfa , timp ) are relevant for the vascular effects of the cluster .
indirect effects through modulation of coagulation factors , such as tissue factor , or through inhibition of tfg - beta signaling [ 19,20 ] , might also impact on tumor angiogenesis .
conversely , vegfa may upregulate mir - 17 - 92 expression in endothelial cells thereby mediating postnatal angiogenesis [ 21 ] .
a recent work on mir - 17 - 92 has also demonstrated its role in endothelial proliferation and sprouting in the context of vegf - dependent tumor angiogenesis .
these experimental data point to the potential value of mir - 17 - 92 as a target for blocking vegfa - stimulated tumor angiogenesis [ 22 ] .
however , no clinical or experimental studies are available addressing the relevance of mir - 17 - 92 for breast cancer angiogenesis , which is highly dependent on vegf stimulation .
the aim of our work was to determine the contribution of mir - 20 , a member of mir - 17 - 92 cluster , to breast cancer angiogenesis , first analyzing the angiogenic effects of its expression on breast cancer cell lines , and second determining its association with the angiogenic characteristics of a clinical series of breast carcinomas .
patients and methods patients and treatment we analyzed a group of consecutive breast cancer patients ( n = 108 ) previously included in a study of angiogenesis in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting , for whom a full characterization of vessel profile ( microvascular density [ mvd ] , mean vessel size [ mvs ] , glomeruloid microvascular proliferation [ gmp ]) and angiogenic markers expression ( vegfa , pdgfa , thbs1 , hif1a ) was available ( n = 86 ) [ 9 ] .
all patients had a histological diagnosis of breast cancer and had been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( most of them sequential anthracyclines and taxanes ) at the hospital general universitario morales meseguer , spain .
the study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of helsinki .
all patients gave written informed consent .
this specific study was approved by the institutional review board of hospital morales meseguer ( comite etico y de investigacion clinica del hospital g. universitario morales meseguer ) , with internal code of approval : estu - 23 / 12 .
histological studies assessment of vascular profile was performed in 4 mum full - section pre - treatment core - biopsies , previously stained with an anti - cd34 antibody ( clone qbend - 10 ; m7165 ; dako , glostrup , denmark ) , as previously reported .
after automatized digital scanning ( leica scn400f ) , three to five 100x digital pictures were independently obtained by two of the authors .
computerized image analysis based on imagej software ( nih ) was used to determine microvessel density ( normalized to a 0.20 mm field ) and mean vessel size ( vessel area per vessel ; mum2 ) .
manual quantification of glomerular vascular proliferation ( gmp ) was also performed ; the presence of at least one gmp was used as a criterion to define a case as gmp + .
rna purification and rt - qpcr total rna from ffpe pre - treatment biopsies was extracted using rneasy ffpe kit ( qiagen , germantown , md , usa ) according to supplier instructions .
total rna from cultured cells was purified using rnazol reagent ( mrc , cincinnati , oh , usa ) and direct - zol rna miniprep kit ( zymo research , irvine , ca , usa ) .
rt - qpcr for all microrna and for mrna ( with pre - amplification ) was performed using taqman gene expression assays ( fisher scientific , madrid , spain ) in a lightcycler 480 ( r ) real - time pcr system .
expression studies for transfected cell lines were performed 48 hours after transfection .
relative expression was calculated as 2deltact using u6 snrna and actb as endogenous controls for microrna and mrna respectively .
to determine vegf effect on mir - 20a expression by luminal breast cancer cells , mcf7 cells were grown in absence or presence of recombinant human vegf ( fisher scientific , madrid , spain ) at low and high concentrations ( 0.5 ng / ml and 10 ng / ml ) over 24 or 48 hours .
after incubation , cells were washed twice with pbs and lysed with rnazol ( mrc , cincinnati , oh , usa ) .
rna was extracted and mir - 20a expression was evaluated as previously described .
mirna transfections mcf7 ( atcc : htb - 22 ) and mda - mb - 231 ( atcc : crm - htb - 26 ) were provided by servicio de apoyo a la investigacion ( sai , universidad de murcia ) , and maintained in dmem - glutamax 1 g / l glucose , 10 % fbs ( gibco , madrid , spain ) .
cell line authentication testing was determined in our lab by analysis of the atcc recommended str loci ( th01 , tpox , vwa , csf1po , d16s539 , d7s820 , d13s317 and d5s818 plus amelogenin ) .
mir - 20a transient transfections were performed using siport neofx transfection agent ( invitrogen , barcelona , spain ) and mirvana ( tm ) mirna mimics ( life technologies ) or mircury lna ( tm ) microrna inhibitors ( exiqon , vedbaek , denmark ) according to manufacturer 's instructions in 6 - well culture plates .
each experiment was repeated three times with at least three replicates for each condition .
in vitro angiogenesis assays for culture medium preparation , after 24 hours of transient transfection in 6 - well plates ( 200,000 cells per well ) , cells were washed twice with pbs and then 3 ml of fresh medium ( dmem 1g / l glucose , 1 % non - essential aminoacids , 1 % pyruvate , without serum and without phenol red ) was added .
after 24 hours of cell growing , conditioned medium was collected , centrifuged at 200g for 5 minutes , and then concentrated 10x using vivaspin 20 ( 10,000 mwco ) concentrators ( sartorius , madrid , spain ) , 0.22 mum filtered and stored at - 80degreesc until use .
for all in vitro angiogenesis assays , fetal bovine serum was absent of cell culture medium .
for angiogenesis assays , 5.000 ea.hy926 endothelial cells and 100 mul conditioned medium from either mcf7 or mda - mb - 231 transfected with mir - 20a mimic / silencer and controls ( negative control transfected cells ) was added ( 8 replicates per condition ) to 96 - well plates containing bd matrigel ( tm ) basement membrane matrix not reduced in growth factors ( becton dickinson , madrid , spain ) .
after 24 hours of incubation with serum - free medium , the length and characteristics of vessel - like tubes , including the number of nodes or branchpoints , were measured by image analysis with angiogenesis analyzer plugin for imagej [ 23 ] .
each experiment was repeated three times .
for evaluating mir - 20a effect on angiogenesis in a vegf - rich or vegf - free environment , conditioned medium from mcf7 was incubated with 500 mug / ml aflibercept ( zaltrap , barcelona , spain ) or pbs control for 1 hour at 37degreesc and then in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed as previously described .
evaluation of endothelial cell proliferation after 24 hours growing in conditioned medium ( without fetal bovine serum ) from mcf7 cells was assayed by xtt cell proliferation kit ii ( roche , madrid , spain ) in 96 - well plates ( five well per condition ) in a biotek synergy ht reader .
the conditions assayed were : conditioned medium from mcf7 previously transfected with mir - 20a or scrambled control ( 50 nm each ) +/ - aflibercept ( 500 mug / ml ) ( sanofi - aventis , spain ) .
electrophoresis and western blotting after cell lysis using ripa buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitors ( thermo - fisher ) protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay .
sds - page was carried out with 25 mug of whole protein lysates per well in a bio - rad electrophoresis system .
transference was performed using amersham te 77 pwr for one hour .
western - blot was performed using 5 % milk in pbst as blocking agent and vegfa (# ab46154 , abcam , cambridge , uk ) and beta - actin (# a5441 ; sigma - aldrich , madrid , spain ) primary antibodies .
pvdf membranes were revealed with amersham ( tm ) ecl ( tm ) prime in imagequant las4000 ( ge - healthcare , murcia , spain ) .
statistical analyses and external validation of results statistical analysis was performed with spss 21.0 software ( spss , inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
non - parametric tests ( u mann - whitney or kruskal - wallis ) were used for comparison of quantitative variables between groups , and chi - squared test for comparison of proportions .
the association between continuous variables was tested with the spearman rank - correlation coefficient .
to evaluate the contribution of mir - 20a to a high - risk angiogenic profile , we built multivariate logistic regression models including vegfa expression and triple - negative subtype as covariates .
survival analysis with kaplan - meier method and log - rank test was performed to evaluate the impact of mirna expression on overall ( os ) and disease - free survival ( dfs ) .
all test were two - sided and a p value <= 0.05 was considered as statistically significant .
external validation of angiogenesis markers and mirna expression correlation and of associations between mirna expression and clinical characteristics was based on the analysis of breast cancer public database from tcga ( the cancer genome atlas ) [ 24 ] .
results in vitro effects of mir - 20a on breast cancer angiogenesis to explore the in vitro angiogenic effects of mir - 20a in breast cancer cells we first analyzed the baseline expression of mir - 20a and angiogenic factors in mcf7 and mda - mb - 231 breast cancer cell lines , representing luminal and basal - like breast cancer subtypes .
we found a significantly higher expression of mir - 20a , vegfa and thbs1 in mda - mb - 231 cells ( s1 table ) .
tube formation assay performed with conditioned media from mda - mb - 231 and mcf7 showed differences in capillary - like structure formation by ea.hy926 endothelial cells : total tube length was slightly smaller ( p = 0.001 ) ( fig 1a ) and mean mesh size was higher ( p = 0.005 ) ( fig 1c ) for mda - mb - 231 than for mcf7 , while no significant differences were found for total mesh area ( fig 1b ) .
these data , taken together with the higher levels of expression of angiogenic factors , are consistent with a different angiogenic potential of mda - mb - 231 , a triple negative breast cancer cell line , able to form larger vascular meshes .

( b ) no significant differences in total mesh area .
( c ) significantly larger mesh size ( p = 0.005 ) induced by conditioned media from mda - mb - 231 breast carcinoma cells .
all experiments were repeated three times ( with eight biological replicates per condition ) .
units of length ( tubule length and mesh size ) and area ( total mesh area ) correspond to x104 pixels .
in order to determine the contribution of mir - 20a to breast cancer angiogenesis , transfection of mda - mb - 231 and mcf7 with mir - 20a mimic and anti - mir - 20a was performed and conditioned media from transfected cell lines was used for tube formation assays with ea.hy926 endothelial cells .
as shown in fig 2 and table 1 , the effects of mir - 20a were different in both cell lines : for mcf7 cells , with a low baseline expression of mir - 20a , mir - 20a mimic increased some angiogenic variables , while in mda - mb - 231 , with a high baseline expression of mir - 20a , angiogenic changes were induced by anti - mir - 20a .
total mesh area was modified by mir - 20a - mimic neither in mcf7 nor in mda - mb - 231 ( fig 2a ) , while antimir - 20a decreased total mesh area in mda - mb - 231 cells ( p = 0.001 ) ( fig 2b ) .
modifications of mean mesh size were observed both after transfection of mcf7 with mir - 20a - mimic , with a significant increase ( p = 0.046 )( fig 2c ) , and after using anti - mir - 20a in mda - mb - 231 cells , with a significant decrease of mesh size ( p = 0.005 ) ( fig 2d ) .
total tube length was not modified by mir - 20a - mimic ( fig 2e ) , and we only observed a slight increase with anti - mir - 20a in mda - mb - 231 breast cancer cells ( p = 0.049 ) ( fig 2f ) .
finally , the analysis of branching points ( number of nodes ) did not show any difference for mda - mb - 231 cells , while a borderline significant increase of them was observed after treatment with conditioned media from mcf7 cells transfected with anti - mir - 20a ( table 1 ) .
the overexpression of mir - 20a in mcf7 breast cancer cells did not change the mrna expression of vegfa ( p = 0.20 ) or other angiogenic factors , such as pdgfa ( p = 0.83 ) or ctgf ( p = 0.83 ) ( s2 table ) .
also , no mir - 20 related changes in protein expression of vegfa were observed ( s1 fig ) .
transfection of mir - 20a mimic did not significantly change the expression of other members of the cluster mir - 17 - 92 , except for a mild increase in mir - 17 expression ( s3 table ) .
in summary , mir - 20a seems to modify the morphology of the vascular - like network , inducing a significant increase in the mean size of the meshes , but either without or with only slight changes in the total tube length and without changes in the expression of vegfa or other angiogenic factors .

to further understand the relationship between vegfa levels and mir - 20a angiogenic effects , we performed additional experiments analyzing the potential modification of mir - 20a expression by exposure to vegfa .
as shown in fig 3 , treatment of mcf7 cells with vegfa at low and high concentrations ( 0.5 and 10 ng / ml ) did not modify mir - 20a expression , thereby suggesting that mir - 20a expression is not related to vefga levels in the tumor environment .
additionally , to determine whether vegfa was essential for the mir - 20a angiogenic effect , angiogenesis assays were performed with conditioned media from mcf7 cells transfected with mir - 20a and treated with or without aflibercept , a vefg - trap with antiangiogenic effects [ 25 ] .
as shown in s2 fig no pro - angiogenic effect of mir - 20a was observed in the presence of aflibercept , suggesting that mir - 20a angiogenic effects are vegfa - dependent .
finally , we evaluated endothelial cells proliferation in the same experimental model : a slight decrease of endothelial proliferation was observed when conditioned medium obtained from mcf7 cells transfected with mir - 20a , while no significant changes in proliferation of endothelial cells were observed in the presence of aflibercept , thereby supporting the relevance of vegfa exposure for mir - 20a effects on endothelium ( s3 fig ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0194638.g003 fig 3 effect of vegfa exposure on mir - 20a expression by mcf7 cells .
no significant change of mcf7 mir - 20a expression ( relative to snu6 expression ) after exposure to low ( 0.5 ng / ml ) or high ( 10 ng / ml ) recombinant human vegfa concentrations ( 24 and 48 hours ) .
association of mir - 20a expression with clinical characteristics and angiogenic marker expression in public databases we analyzed the association between mir - 20a expression and clinical characteristics of breast cancer using the tcga breast cancer database ( s4 table ) .
a significantly higher expression of mir - 20a was found in estrogen receptor - negative tumors , and particularly in basal - like molecular subtype .
the expression of mir - 20a was also higher in luminal b tumors than in luminal a and her2 - enriched subtypes .
although no previous data are available on the association of mir - 17 - 92 expression and the vascular profile of breast carcinoma , the tcga database was also used to explore the associations between mir - 20a and the expression of angiogenic markers ( s5 table ) .
a significant direct association was found for vegfa and hif1a , while a negative significant correlation was found for thbs1 , ctgf and pdgfa .
expression of mir - 20a in breast cancer and its association with clinical and pathological characteristics in order to clinically confirm the relevance of mir - 20a for breast cancer angiogenesis , its expression was examined in pre - treatment paraffin - embedded core biopsies from a series of breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( s1 dataset ) .
the characterization of the angiogenic profile in patients of this group with enough available tissue ( n = 86 ) has been previously described [ 9 ] .
the expression of mir - 20a was significantly higher in tumors with no expression of hormone receptors ( hr ) , in triple negative breast cancer and in those cases with more extensive nodal involvement ( cn2 - 3 ) ( table 2 ) .
histological grade 3 was also associated with higher mir - 20a expression .
expression levels , however , were not different among subgroups of patients defined by her2 overexpression , or by clinical or pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( table 2 ) .
no association was found between mir - 20a expression and dfs ( log - rank test ; p = 0.62 ) or os ( log - rank test ; p = 0.78 ) .
these findings were in agreement with those obtained from tcga .

breast carcinomas with high ( over the median ) mean vessel size showed a higher expression of mir - 20a ( u mann - whitney ; p = 0.013 ) ( fig 4a ) .
the analysis of the expression of other members of the cluster mir - 17 - 92 in the same biopsies showed a high degree of correlation between them and with mir - 20a ( p < 0.0001 in all cases ) ( s6 table ) .
however , no association of mvs with other members of mir - 17 - 92 cluster was found ( s7 table ) .
in order to further understand the basis for the association of mir - 20a expression with mvs , we analyzed the correlations between mir - 20a expression and the angiogenic biomarkers profile of breast cancer .
we observed a significant correlation of its expression with vegfa tumor levels ( p = 0.004 ; correlation coefficient [ cc ] : 0.346 ) .
the expression of pdgfa was inversely correlated with mir - 20a , while no differences were observed for thbs1 , hif1 and ctgf ( table 3 ) .
thus , a higher mir - 20a expression was associated with a distinct angiogenic profile characterized by a high vessel size pattern and high vegfa expression .

breast tumors with this angiogenic profile ( approximately , 28 % of all cases ) showed a particularly high expression of vegfa [ 9 ] and mir - 20a ( p < 0.0001 ) ( fig 4b ) ( s8 table ) .
this association did not seem to be derived only from the correlation between vegfa and mir - 20a expression , since mir - 20a expression was an independent factor for its occurrence in a multivariate logistic regression model including vegfa expression and breast cancer subtype ( s9 table ) .
discussion we here show that the expression of mir - 20a , a member of the mir - 17 - 92 cluster , is associated with the angiogenic profile of breast cancer .
in vitro data using conditioned media from breast cancer cell lines transfected with mir - 20a suggest that mir - 20a induces an increased vascular mesh size .
the analysis of a clinical series consistently shows that a higher mir - 20a expression is associated with a vascular pattern consisting in larger vessels and complex vascular structures ( glomeruloid microvascular proliferations ) , together with high vegfa expression .
our results for the in vitro tube formation assay showing a significant increase in the mean size of the endothelial meshes , together with slight changes in the number of branching nodes and in endothelial proliferation , suggest that mir - 20a modifies the characteristics of the vascular - like network and might contribute to the development of an abnormal angiogenic pattern in breast carcinomas .
although mir - 20a expression was also associated with a distinct angiogenic pattern and an increased vascular size in pre - treatment biopsies , our in vitro findings are not exactly parallel to histological data since no change was observed in vascular density .
previous data on mir - 17 - 92 cluster regulation suggest that angiogenic modulation occur in the context of a high vegf environment .
the transcriptional control of mir - 17 - 92 in endothelial cells seems to be vegf - dependent [ 22 ] , and in a mouse model with endothelial mir - 17 - 92 deletion , the participation of the cluster mir - 17 - 92 in vegf - dependent tumor angiogenesis was demonstrated .
although our model is focused in the effects of mir - 20a expression on tumor cells , and not on endothelial cells , we found that mir - 20a modifies neither vascular density nor expression of angiogenic factors , similarly to the results obtained after transfection of the whole cluster mir - 17 - 92 [ 21,22 ] .
however , the effects of mir - 17 - 92 on breast carcinoma biology are pleiotropic [ 26 ] and might also include indirect effects on angiogenesis or metastatic potential [ 27 ] , potentially related to extracellular matrix changes [ 28 ] , complex modulation of er pathways [ 29 ] or regulation of tumor - suppressor genes [ 30,31 ] .
additionally , previous reports have shown different effects of mir - 17 / 20 on endothelial cells when analyzed either in vitro or in vivo and a predominantly antiangiogenic effect in colorectal cancer [ 32,33 ] , which suggest that angiogenesis regulation by mir - 17 - 92 is both microenvironment - and cell type - dependent .
interestingly , our data show that vegf levels do not modify the expression of mir - 20a and , at the same time , that treatment with a vegfa trap inhibits the angiogenesis induced by luminal breast cancer cells transfected with mir - 20a .
additionally , the mild decrease of endothelial proliferation induced by overexpression of mir - 20a in tumor cells was not observed in the presence of aflibercept .
taken together , these findings are consistent with the notion that mir - 20a - related modulation of breast cancer angiogenesis is dependent on vegfa .
our clinical data further support the experimental results .
we found higher levels of mir - 20a in er negative tumors , and especially in triple negative breast cancer , in agreement with previous analysis of mirna expression profiles in this subtype [ 34 ] , for which mir - 17 - 92 expression has been proposed as a distinctive characteristic [ 35 ] .
the association of mir - 20a expression with grade 3 and especially with higher nodal involvement has not been shown previously [ 36 ] , but is also consistent with our analysis of tcga public database .
the higher expression of mir - 20a in mda - mb - 231 ( triple negative ) when compared with mcf7 ( luminal ) cell line also reflects the clinical results and has been previously reported [ 37 ] .
as far as we know , no previous work has analyzed the correlation of mir - 17 - 92 expression with the vascular pattern in breast carcinomas .
our finding of the association between mir - 20a expression and a high risk vascular profile defined by larger size vessels and by the presence of gmp is thus a novel finding , which warrants further study of mir - 20a angiogenic effects on breast cancer .
clinical and experimental data suggest that these effects occur in the context of a high vegfa - tumor microenvironment [ 38 ] .
the induction by mir - 20a of an abnormal vascular maturation characterized by higher size vessels might be also prognostically relevant [ 9,14 ] .
these results do not seem to be merely explained by the association with the triple negative subtype , since mir - 20a expression was still an independent factor for the occurrence of this vascular profile in the multivariate analysis , and only one in four of our patients had a triple negative breast cancer .
our experimental results in mcf7 cells might suggest the involvement of mir - 20a in luminal breast cancer angiogenesis , although the correlation of clinical and in vitro data is incomplete and the level of mir - 20a is usually low in this tumor subtype .
our work has several limitations , the main one being the small sample size .
although experimental results are globally consistent with clinical and pathological data , the effects were moderate and further mechanistic insights might also be obtained with a more comprehensive analysis of angiogenic markers and endothelial changes ( apoptosis , proliferation , migration ) or with in vivo experiments focusing on the angiogenic effects of mir - 20a .
also , part of our findings , such as the increased microvessel size , might be caused by changes in pericyte coverage [ 39 ] , a possibility that was not addressed in this study .
additionally , our in vitro experimental model allows neither the understanding of the physiological consequences of a high vascular size nor an evaluation of other angiogenic mechanisms mediated by tumor microenvironment .
however , these findings , if confirmed , raise the possibility for the development of angiogenesis - related mirnas as surrogate biomarkers of a vegf - dependent high - risk angiogenic profile .
in particular , circulating mirna or mirna determined in other body fluids are easily determined and might be used to prognostically stratify breast cancer patients [ 40 ] or as screening tools for selection of patients for trials with anti - angiogenic drugs [ 41 ] .
in fact , other members of the cluster mir - 17 - 92 have been included in a breast cancer diagnostic signature of circulating mirna [ 42 ] , although no data are available regarding its association with tumor angiogenesis .
additionally , the data showing an almost complete abrogation of vessel formation by aflibercept in the experimental model of mcf7 cells transfected with mir - 20a might suggest the potential value of high mir - 20a expression as a marker of sensitivity to antiangiogenic strategies , which warrants further studies to evaluate its predictive value .
conclusions expression of mir - 20a , a member of the mir - 17 - 92 cluster , in breast cancer cells induces the development of an abnormal vascular mesh .
in agreement with experimental data , its expression in invasive breast carcinomas is associated with a vegf - related high - risk angiogenic profile characterized by larger vessels and glomeruloid microvascular proliferations .
further clinical and experimental validation of these findings might be relevant for the use of mir - 20a as a biomarker for selection of antiangiogenic treatments for breast cancer and as a potential new angiogenic target .

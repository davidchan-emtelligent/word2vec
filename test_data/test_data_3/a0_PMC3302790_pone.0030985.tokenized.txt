the c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) - inhibiting peptide d - jnki - 1 , syn .
xg - 102 was tested for its therapeutic potential in acute inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) in mice .
rectal instillation of the chemical irritant trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( tnbs ) provoked a dramatic acute inflammation in the colon of 7 - 9 weeks old mice .
coincident subcutaneous application of 100 microg / kg xg - 102 significantly reduced the loss of body weight , rectal bleeding and diarrhoea .
after 72 h , the end of the study , the colon was removed and immuno - histochemically analysed .
xg - 102 significantly reduced ( i ) pathological changes such as ulceration or crypt deformation , ( ii ) immune cell pathology such as infiltration and presence of cd3 - and cd68 - positive cells , ( iii ) the production of tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha in colon tissue cultures from tnbs - treated mice , ( iv ) expression of bim , bax , fasl , p53 , and activation of caspase 3 , ( v ) complexation of jnk2 and bim , and ( vi ) expression and activation of the jnk substrate and transcription factor c - jun .
a single application of subcutaneous xg - 102 was at least as effective or even better depending on the outcome parameter as the daily oral application of sulfasalazine used for treatment of ibd .
the successful and substantial reduction of the severe , tnbs - evoked intestinal damages and clinical symptoms render the jnk - inhibiting peptide xg - 102 a powerful therapeutic principle of ibd .
introduction modulators of immune cells or immune responses belong to the most intensively studied and most promising drugs .
this holds also true for the common diseases with inflammatory and / or auto - immune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis , asthma , multiple sclerosis , cancer or inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) .
the pathogenetic development of ibd is characterized by three causative areas such as ( i ) genetic susceptibility for mutations of proteins facilitating the access of microbes to the epithelium and underlying layers , ( ii ) luminal antigenic provocation from endogenous microbes or food allergens and ( iii ) environmental triggers ( reviewed by [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ]) .
many of these changes or risk factors are linked to the signalling pathways regulating both the innate and adaptive immune system .
as a consequence , experimental strategies and present - day medical therapies aim at the control of immune reactions and t cell responses e.g. by aminosalicylates , corticosteroids , immunosuppressants and immunomodulators including tnf - alpha - blockers [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
the jnk , a group of mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapk ) family members , are crucial mediators of various pathological signalling pathways underlying ibd .
jnk activity , which is increased in ibd patients [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , sensitizes epithelial cells against bacterial components and cytokines [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
among numerous pathological alterations , jnks are also involved in the maturation and function of t cells , the production of cytokines and the tnf - alpha - induced expression of e - selectin on endothelial cells , which is critical for leukocyte adhesion and infiltration .
moreover , jnk act as transducers of endoplasmatic reticulum ( er ) stress [ 3 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
therefore , inhibition of jnks emerges as a promising therapeutic principle in various inflammatory diseases including ibd [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] and was previously shown to counteract colorectal tumorigenesis [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] that occurs in the cause of chronic ibd .
so far , the development of anti - jnk therapies was limited due to the lack of appropriate inhibitors with high specificity and cell - permeability .
the tat - fused jnk - inhibiting peptide xg - 102 ( d - jnki - 1 ) meets both criteria and is a substantial advancement [ 25 ] .
as demonstrated in several preclinical studies , xg - 102 and similar peptidergic jnk - inhibitor could improve the outcome in several degenerative processes like hearing loss [ 26 ] , cerebral ischemia [ 27 ] , haemorrhage [ 28 ] , retinal neovascularisation and retinal exitotoxicity [ 29 ] , metabolic syndromes including diabetes [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , as well as atherosclerosis [ 32 ] ( reviewed by [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ]) .
in clinical studies , xg - 102 demonstrated therapeutic effectiveness in traumatic hearing loss [ 36 ] and uveitis [ 37 ] .
in the present study , we investigated for the first time the therapeutic potential of the jnk - inhibiting peptide xg - 102 to counteract the pathological features provoked by tnbs , an acute model of ibd with predominant t helper 1 ( th1 ) - mediated immune response [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
the single subcutaneous application of 100 microg / kg xg - 102 powerfully reduced the pronounced clinical , histological and immunological alterations and lesions following acute tnbs colitis in mice .
the therapeutic effectiveness of a single xg - 102 application was at least as potent as the repetitively applied standard competitor and clinical drug sulfasalazine .
results disease activity index ( dai ) normal mice normal mice gained per average 1.7 % on average of their body weight within 72 h , the hemoccult of all normal mice was negative and dai did not surpass 1.3 ( fig. 1 ) .

* , ** , *** = p < 0.05 , p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 for all groups compared with tnbs group .
tnbs after tnbs instillation , weight loss started rapidly .
within 24 h , animals lost 10.5 % per average of their body weight and after 72 h , the end of the observation period , weight loss was still 9.3 % compared to the body weight before the tnbs administration .
tnbs provoked severe diarrhoea with blood .
the initial hemoccult score was 2.5 on average after 24 h and declined to 1.1 after 72 h. the dai reflected these changes with a maximum of 7.8 after 24 h , and it was still elevated with 5.1 after 72 h ( fig. 1 ) .
subcutanous xg - 102 the sc. injection of xg - 102 significantly and dose - dependently attenuated the clinical parameters .
one hundred microg / kg xg - 102 sc. most effectively reduced weight loss and the animals almost completely regained their initial body weight .
moreover , the hemoccult score was significantly ( p < 0.05 , data not shown ) attenuated after 24 h and was almost normal after 72 h. in consequence , xg - 102 dose - dependently diminished the composed dai by more than 50 % ( p < 0.01 ) at 100 microg / kg after 24 and 48 h ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
for sc. application of 50 microg / kg xg - 102 scores were all consistently better compared to solvent treatment , but did not reach significance .
10 microg / kg sc. xg - 102 was not effective ( data no shown ) .
oral sulfasalazine daily 10 mg / kg sulfasalazine was as effective for the reductions of weight loss and dai as single sc .

gross pathology and histological analysis ( h & e stain ) macroscopical inspection of the colon immediately after the animals' death , showed a strong hyperemia , necrosis , and inflammation after tnbs administration .
it was obvious that 100 sc. xg - 102 or 10 mg / kg po. sulfasalazine attenuated these features .
tissue damage normal mice healthy mice displayed regular crypts with goblet cells ; lymphocytes in the lamina propria were rarely detectable .
occasional lymphoid nodules were identified in the submucosa .
inflammatory infiltrates were absent .
normal crypts were linked with the underlying lamina muscularis .
tnbs the tnbs administration caused a severe transmural inflammation characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cell ( fig. 2 ) .
the inflammation was accompanied by multifocal dropouts of entire crypts and severe ulcerations , loss of goblet cells , and fibrosis .
as a further characteristic change of the acute inflammation , the submucosa was enlarged by a pronounced oedema .
the maximum of pathological alterations was found in the distal part of the colon , but was also present in the medial part ( fig. 2 ) .

for the tissue damage score ( hatched bars ) , the scores of ulcer , crypts and submucosa were summed - up for each individual animal , and the mean +/ - sem was calculated for each group .
the mean +/ - sem of the infiltration score ( grey bar ) is separately shown .
*** , ** = p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 for all groups compared with tnbs group .
xg - 102 subcutaneous application of 100 microg / kg xg - 102 significantly reduced the parameters of inflammation and tissue destruction .
the total score of the three histological parameters was significantly attenuated by sc. xg - 102 equally in the distal colon ( p < 0.01 ) and medial colon ( p < 0.001 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
xg - 102 almost completely restored the histological appearance of the mucosa compared with the tnbs group .
sulfasalazine sulfasalazine reduced the h & e parameters in the distal and medial colon ( fig. 2 ) , but did not reach significance .
infiltration of immune cells besides the severe tissue damage , tnbs caused a massive infiltration of immune cells in the distal colon and to a lesser extent in the medial part .
the infiltration comprised the invasion of macrophages , lymphocytes and leukocytes ( fig. 2 ) .
only 100 microg / kg xg - 102 sc. significantly ( p < 0.01 ) lowered the infiltration score in both the distal and medial colon .
the decrease following sulfasalazine did not reach significance ( fig. 2 ) .
cd3 and cd68 immunofluorescence normal mice and tnbs in normal animals , only few cd3 - and cd68 - positive cells were detectable ( fig. 3 , 4 ) .
tnbs evoked a dramatic infiltration of cd3 - and cd68 - positive cells in the lamina propria , submucosa and epithelium ( fig. 3 , 4 ) .

xg - 102 single subcutaneous application of 100 microg / kg xg - 102 significantly ( p < 0.05 ) diminished the numbers of cd3 - and cd68 - positive cells in the distal colon ( fig. 3 ) .
the cd3 / cd68 - signals were attenuated in all layers of the distal colon , i.e. epithelium , lamina propria and submucosa ( fig. 4 ) .
in the medial colon , the reduction of cd3 - positive cells reached almost significance .
production of tnf - alpha tnf - alpha release was measured in organic colon cultures 24 h after the removal of the colon .
tnbs provoked a dramatic rise in tnf - alpha concentration to 261 +/ - 47 pg / ml compared to normal mice ( 67 +/ - 20 pg / ml ) .
treatment with xg - 102 ( 100 microg / kg sc. ) significantly ( p < 0.01 ) reduced the tnf - alpha production ( 89 +/ - 6 pg / ml ) to concentration levels of normal mice ( fig. 5 ) .

markers of apoptosis inflammation in the gut causes apoptotic cell death in intestinal mucosa [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 40 ] .
to investigate the potential of xg - 102 to attenuate tnbs - induced apoptosis , western blot analysis of apoptotic proteins were performed with lysates from colon tissue 12 h , 24 h and 72 h after tnbs application .
the levels of cleaved i.e. activated caspase - 3 activity were substantially enhanced after 24 h compared to normal mice ( fig. 6a ) .
xg - 102 ( 100 microg / kg sc. ) almost completely abrogated the signal of caspase - 3 activity , whereas the presence of total uncleaved caspase - 3 remained unchanged ( fig. 6a ) .
immunoreactivity of cleaved caspase - 3 was localized in the deranged epithelium ( data not shown ) .
protein expression of bax and bim , regulators of programmed cell death , were increased with maximal levels after 12 h and 24 h , respectively ( fig. 6b ) .
xg - 102 lowered these expressions at all time points investigated ( fig. 6b ) .
similarly , xg - 102 attenuated the expression levels of fasl and p 53 ( fig. 6c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0030985.g006 figure 6 apoptosis .
western blot analysis of ( a ) caspase - 3 and cleaved caspase - 3 , ( b ) bax and bim , and ( c ) fasl and p53 from colon extracts of untreated controls ( co ) 12 h , 24 h and 72 h following trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( tnbs ) administration without or with xg - 102 ( 100 microg / kg sc. ) .
these blots are representative of 3 independent experiments .
the activation of bim depends on its physical interaction with jnk [ 41 ] but this issue has not been addressed so far in intestinal tissues .
here we provide evidence that both , jnk1 and jnk2 can be seen in bim positive protein complexes , but it is jnk2 only that is increased in this protein pool from whole cell lysates ( fig. 7 ) .
xg - 102 does not only prevent this up regulation but almost completely abolishes the bim - jnk2 signal .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0030985.g007 figure 7 jnk2 - bim co - precipitation .
jnk1 and jnk2 immunoprecipitates ( ip ) from colon tissue homogenates were analyzed by western blotting with an anti - bim antibody .
pounceau staining demonstrated equal loading ( data not shown ) .
summarizing these data that jnk are strong inducers of tnbs - induced apoptosis .
the jnk inhibitor xg - 102 substantially reduces various apoptotic features .
expression and activation of c - jun finally , the expression of c - jun and its n - terminal phosphorylation exclusively catalyzed by jnks , were determined either in whole cell extracts by western blotting ( fig. 8 ) or immunohistochemistry .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0030985.g008 figure 8 c - jun and phospho - c - jun .
western blot analysis of c - jun and phospho - c - jun in colon homogenates from untreated controls ( co ) and 12 h or 24 h following trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( tnbs ) administration without or with xg - 102 ( 100 microg / kg sc. ) .
these blots are representative of 3 independent experiments .
expression of c - jun was maximal until 12 h and declined to control levels after 24 h ( fig. 8 ) .
phosphorylation of c - jun revealed a similar time course .
single application of xg - 102 ( 100 microg / kg sc. ) attenuated both the expression and activation of c - jun ( fig. 8 ) , and this attenuation can be considered as indirect proof of inhibition of jnk by xg - 102 .
activation of jnk reached its maximum after 3 h and strongly decreased after 12 h ; these changes were not affected by xg - 102 ( data not shown ) .
in the colon of normal mice , only a restricted number of scattered cells were immunoreactive for c - jun and immunoreactive phospho - c - jun was absent. between 3 h and 12 h after tnbs , the expression of c - jun increased in the crypts , intestinal wall and infiltrating immune cells , confirming the results from western blotting ( data not shown ) .
the nuclear immunoreactivity of phosphorylated c - jun was predominantly localized in the damaged epithelium .
the intensity of phospho - c - jun immunoreactivity in infiltrated inflammatory cells correlated with the extent of inflammation .
these p - c - jun signals were substantially attenuated within 12 h following xg - 102 ( 100 microg / kg sc . )
( immunohistochemical data not shown ) .
thus , the jnk signalling pathway is rapidly activated during early ibd development following local tnbs and reduced by the jnk inhibitor peptide xg - 102 .
discussion the present study has addressed for the first time the effect of the peptidergic and highly specific jnk inhibitor xg - 102 on tnbs - induced acute colon inflammation , a disease model which shares pathophysiological properties of crohn 's disease [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
the basic and strong pro - inflammatory actions of jnks and the potent anti - inflammatory effects of jnk - inhibitors [ 33 ] raised the question of the protection of inflamed colon tissue by xg - 102 .
results indicate that the jnk inhibitor xg - 102 protects against characteristic pathological features of tnbs - triggered colon inflammation .
the effect of a single application of xg - 102 was at least as pronounced or even better as the daily oral gavage of sulfasalazine , a standard drug for experimental and of clinical treatment inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibd ) [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
dose - dependently , xg - 102 significantly reduced the clinical parameters ( body weight , blood in stool , stool consistency ) , ulceration , crypt deformations , immune cell infiltration , production of tnf - alpha , cleavage of caspase - 3 , expression of bax , bim , fasl and p53 , the complexation of jnk2 with bim and finally , expression and activation of c - jun .
normalization of clinical features a single tnbs instillation induces transient clinical changes ( summarized by the disease activity score index , dai ) which return to normal pre - experimental values between 4 and 7 days .
in order to detect the protective effects by xg - 102 , we terminated the experiments after 72 h , i.e. before normalization of dai components .
in our hands , maximal weight loss reached 14 % on average after tnbs , an extent similar to other reports [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
the action of xg - 102 was rather fast , since it significantly attenuated jnk activity and weight loss already after 12 h. in addition , xg - 102 confers a long - lasting action at least for 72 h , when the clinical parameters of dai had returned to pre - experimental values .
the re - gain of body weight could be merely due to an improved drinking response , but the normalization of hemoccult and stool consistency indicates a true limitation of the inflammatory process .
morphological alterations the pathogenetic mechanism of tnbs - induced colitis , a delayed - type hypersensitivity response to the hapten - modified self antigens [ 43 ] , [ 46 ] , comprises the destruction of epithelial cells and infiltration of lymphocytes , which in turn stimulates a regional inflammation through production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators [ 19 ] .
the histological examination of the colon from tnbs - treated mice showed a dramatic inflammation with parameters of immune cell infiltration and ulcerative tissue destruction after 72 h. the jnk inhibitor xg - 102 most effectively reduced this pathological histopathology and almost normalized the colon tissue .
this is in line with recent studies using different inhibitors of the jnk pathway such as sb203580 or sp600125 [ 9 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 46 ] or molecules interacting with mapk like curcumin [ 47 ] .
for the most part , these inhibitors have been tested in studies of either dextran sulphate sodium - induced ( dss ) colitis or hapten - induced colitis ( tnbs ) in mice or rats , to study their capacities to prevent mucosal inflammation rather than their capacities to reverse established inflammation , a more stringent test .
inflammation and immune cell infiltration xg - 102 counteracted the infiltration of immune cells as shown for cd 3 - and cd68 - positive cells .
cd3 is an antigen and part of the t cell receptor ( tcr ) complex on mature t lymphocytes , and cd68 marks macrophages .
this is perfect in line with data from human specimen from ibd patients [ 20 ] .
the immuno - modulating actions by inhibition of jnk is a common finding in various models of experimental inflammation e.g. animal models for arthritis , pulmonary inflammation , atherosclerosis and other immune challenging procedures ( reviewed by [ 33 ] , [ 35 ]) .
apoptotic and inflammatory features activation of caspase - 3 is the central event of the major type of cellular apoptosis , and in many cases , it occurs downstream of jnk activation ( reviewed by [ 48 ]) .
the almost complete disappearance of cleaved , i.e. activated caspase - 3 following xg - 102 might be consequence of attenuated bax or bim expression as well as the decrease of jnk2 : bim - complex .
jnk2 , but not jnk1 , was found as the jnk isoform responsible for osmotic stress [ 49 ] .
features of apoptosis have been regularly described following ibd pathologies including tnbs [ 39 ] .
the same is true for the production and / or release of tnf - alpha and the expression of its receptors [ 11 ] .
very recently , lamina propria macrophages were identified as a source of tnf - alpha [ 50 ] .
together with other cytokines , tnf - alpha holds a central position within immune cell activation and tissue destruction , and the application of tnf - alpha - antibodies and other antagonistic molecules [ 51 ] is a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of colitis ulcerosa and / or crohn 's disease ( reviewed by [ 7 ]) .
however , tnf - alpha antibody therapy keeps not more than 50 % in remission after one year [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] .
xg - 102 normalizes the enhanced production of tnf - alpha in colon tissue cultures .
jnks are important mediators of tnf - alpha signaling [ 55 ] .
mechanisms of xg - 102 actions ibd pathologies rapidly enhance the activation of jnk and its transcriptional effector substrate c - jun in animals and humans , and link the jnk pathway with the initiation and development of intestinal or gastric inflammation including human ibd [ 9 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 56 ] .
moreover , a correlation has been proposed between the site of jnk activity and loss of responsiveness to steroids [ 57 ] .
xg - 102 blocks the catalytic action of jnk , but not its activation , by inhibition of jnk scaffold formation [ 27 ] , [ 58 ] .
therefore , the analysis of phosphorylated jnk is inappropriate to visualize the functional level of xg - 102 .
moreover , antagonisation of jnk activity including inhibitors of the atp - binding site such as sp600125 increase the level of phosphorylated jnk and their upstream kinases [ 59 ] most likely by failure of negative feed back .
the rapid and effective inhibition of jnk by xg - 102 , i.e. simultaneous but not pre - emptive application with the tnbs provocation , might explain the effectiveness of xg - 102 .
in previous studies with experimental colitis or specimen from patients , inhibition of jnk was followed by down - regulation of c - jun phosphorylation [ 9 ] and ap - 1 target genes such as cyclo - oxygenases , mcp - 1 , icam - 1 or release of cytokines [ 9 ] , [ 20 ] ( reviewed by [ 21 ] .
attenuation of activated ap - 1 transcription factor c - jun was seen in experimentally of tnbs and dss colitis [ 40 ] , [ 57 ] .
in our hands , xg - 102 attenuates the expression of c - jun and to a similar extent its n - terminal phosphorylation which is exclusively catalyzed by jnks .
the recent claim that jnk are not part of the ibd pathology merely derives from a missing rise in jnk expression [ 60 ] .
previous observations have already reported on persistent jnk expression with strong rise of its phosphorylation i.e. after cerebral ischemia [ 61 ] .
jnk are mainly regulated by post - translational modifications and more importantly , by stimulus - specific distribution of jnk isoform within various cellular compartments [ 61 ] , [ 62 ] , [ 63 ] .
the mechanisms of xg - 102 are not yet fully understood .
beyond inhibition of jnk functions , it seems to interfere with further pathological processes such as autophagy [ 64 ] .
the principle of jnk inhibition by peptidergic block of the interaction domain offers the putative advantage to target only jnk signalosoms formed under pathological conditions ( discussed [ 65 ] .
the variation of the length of tat - sequence and d / l - stereometry enables efficient variations of half life .
moreover , the exclusive specificity of jnk is in striking contrast with the pronounced inhibition of many other kinases by inhibitors of the atp - domain [ 66 ] .
the putative use of xg - 102 for clinical therapy is tested in clinical studies e.g. of traumatic hearing loss [ 67 ] and uveitis ([ 37 ]) at present .
in pre - clinical animal experiments , xg - 102 and a similar peptidergic jnk - inhibitor conferred promising beneficial effects in models for cerebral ischemia ([ 27 ] , [ 68 ] , [ 69 ]) , diabetes ([ 30 ] , [ 70 ]) , atherosclerosis ([ 32 ]) or lung inflammation ( reviewed by [ 33 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 71 ]) .
conclusion and outlook the single application of the jnk inhibitory peptide xg - 102 ( syn .
d - jnk1 - i ) confers a rapid and lasting anti - inflammatory effectiveness in experimental colitis provoked by the strong immunotoxin tnbs .
the therapeutic effect does not require a pre - emptive application nor any latency time .
the effects of xg - 102 cover a wide range of immunopathological features such as normalization of tissue destruction , loss of body weight and hemorrhage , cytokine production , apoptosis or immune cell invasion .
xg - 102 does not directly interfere with the newly identified pathogenic molecules such as nod2 , atg16l1 or th17 - lymphocytes [ 5 ] .
since ibd pathologies are complex multifactorial processes , xg - 102 offers the advantage to block a central converging point for several immunopathological signal cascades .
materials and methods ethics statement female balb / c mice , 7 to 10 weeks old with 16 - 23 g body weight ( charles river laboratories , sulzfeld , germany ) , were kept in polycarbonate cages in temperature - controlled rooms with 12 h light / dark cycle and access ad libitum to water and standard rodent food before and during the study .
the mice were randomized into groups up to 8 animals .
clinical investigations and all immuno - histological scorings were performed in a double blinded fashion .
this study was carried out in strict accordance with the approval of the ministerium fuer landwirtschaft und naturschutz of schleswig - holstein ( v 312 - 72241.121 - 22 , 60 - 6 / 08 and 74 - 6 / 09 ) and was in agreement with the guidelines for the proper use of animals in biomedical research .
induction of colitis by tnbs th 1 - mediated colitis was induced via rectal instillation of the haptenating agent tnbs ( 2,4,6 - tnbs ; sigma - aldrich , munich , germany ) .
2 mg tnbs were dissolved in 47.5 % ethanol and applied in a final volume of 150 microl per animal .
a 3.5 - f - catheter was carefully inserted approximately 4 cm into the rectum under short anaesthesia of co2 .
mice were carefully held in a vertical position for 1 min after the tnbs administration to ensure distribution of tnbs within the colon and caecum .
at the end of all experiments , i.e. between 3 and 72 h after tnbs instillation , the mice were killed by co2 overdose .
administration of the test compounds xg - 102 ( also termed d - jnki - 1 ) was synthesized and delivered by xigen pharm .
( epalinges , swiss ) .
xg - 102 was dissolved in 0.9 % nacl solution for subcutaneous ( sc. ) application .
xg - 102 was tested as 10 , 50 and 100 microg / kg for sc. application .
xg - 102 was given as single dose immediately before tnbs administration .
in the tnbs group , the solvent only was injected sc. immediately before rectal tnbs administration .
as positive control , 10 mg / kg sulfasalazine ( sigma - aldrich , munich , germany ) was daily applied per os ( po ) by gavage , the first dose immediately before tnbs instillation .
normal animals served as healthy controls .
quantification of disease activity disease activity index ( dai ) comprising body weight , stool consistency and rectal bleeding was determined daily between 8 and 10 am as described in detail elsewhere [ 72 ] .
the scores from these three parameters were summed - up as dai ranging from 0 ( healthy ) to 12 ( maximal severity of colitis ) .
macroscopical inspectation and histological analysis of the colon ( h & e stain ) after sacrifice , the colon was quickly removed , gently rinsed with saline solution and the macroscopically visible damage of the colon was assessed .
the colon was cut in three parts and tissues were fixed in 4 % formalin , embedded in paraffin and cut into 0.5 microm thick sections .
sections were deparaffinized with xylene , rehydrated through graded concentrations of ethanol and stained with hematoxylin ( roth , karlsruhe , germany ) and eosin ( merck , darmstadt , germany ) ( h & e ) using routine techniques .
four to six colon rings from medial and distal colon segment were used for histological examination .
again , histological scoring was performed in a double - blinded manner by two investigators .
h & e - scores were determined for 100 microg / kg xg - 102 sc. only , and not for the other xg - 102 concentrations .
the inflammation score was 1 , presence of occasional inflammatory cells in the lamina propria ; 2 , confluence of inflammatory cells extending into the submucosa ; 3 , transmural extension of the immune cell infiltration .
the tissue damage score ( ranging from 0 to 9 ) was composed by the three parameters thickness of submucosa , structure of crypts and erosion / ulcer ( each ranging 0 - 3 ) .

slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature ( rt ) with the primary antibody against cd3 ( 1:50 ; rabbit ; abcam , cambridge , usa ) and cd68 ( 1:50 ; rat ; hycult biotechnology , beutelsbach , germany ) .
after washing three times with phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) , slides were incubated for 45 min at rt with carbocyanine ( cy3 ) - or fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) - labelled secondary antibody ( 1:200 ; jackson immuno research lab. , suffolk , uk ) .
finally , nuclei were counterstained with finally , nuclei were counterstained with 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( sigma - aldrich , munich , germany ). the total number of cells and cd3 - or cd68 - positive cells were counted in four random sight fields ( roi 600x600 pixels ) comprising the mucosa and submucosa each from distal and medial colon segment .
the percentages of positive immune cells from the total cell population per vision were calculated .
fluorescence was detected by an axiophot microscope ( lsm510 ; zeiss , jena , germany ) with appropriate filter systems .
production of tnf - alpha the production of tnf - alpha was investigated in every second animal ( total n = 16 ) .
a 1 - cm - segment of the transversal colon was removed , cut open longitudinally , and washed in pbs ( containing penicillin and streptomycin ) .
the fragment was placed , and incubated in 24 flat - bottom well culture plates containing 1 ml of fresh rpmi 1640 medium ( paa , colbe , germany ; supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin ) at 37degreesc for 24 h. tnf - alpha was quantified using commercially available enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) kits ( cytoset kit ; bio - source international , camarillo , usa ) according to manufacturers' protocols .
preparation of soluble cell lysates after sacrifice of the animals , the colon tissue was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80degreesc .
thereafter , the tissue was homogenized in 0.2 - 0.4 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) , 8 mm mgcl2 , 0.5 mm edta , 5 mm egta , 250 mm nacl , 0.01 mg / ml pepstatin , 0.01 mg / ml leupeptin , 0.01 mg / ml aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride ( sigma chemical , st. louis , usa ) .
the lysates were frozen and thawed three times and incubated on ice for 30 min .
after sonication for 10 s , the tissue samples were centrifuged at 15,000x g for 15 min at 4degreesc .
protein concentrations were determined using dye reagent , a variant of bradford 's colorimetric assay ( roth , karlsruhe , germany ) .

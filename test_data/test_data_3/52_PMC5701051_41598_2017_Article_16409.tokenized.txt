m ( iv ) - incorporated zeolites have recently aroused wide interest due to outstanding catalytic effects while their active sites remain largely elusive .
here periodic density functional theory calculations are conducted finding that active sites are determined jointly by identity of m ( iv ) ions , topology of zeolites , type of framework species and choice of t sites .
all m2 ( iv ) active sites in bea zeolites are penta - coordinated with chemisorption of one water while subsequent water molecules that form only h - bonds promote chemisorption of the first water , especially the second water possessing comparable or even higher adsorption strengths as the first water ; ti ( iv ) and ge ( iv ) active sites at the intersection remain penta - coordinated and sn ( iv ) and zr ( iv ) active sites prefer to hexa - coordination although potentially expanded to hepta - coordination .
different from other zeolites , ti ( iv ) active sites in fer zeolites are hexa - coordinated as sn ( iv ) active sites , due to the promoting effect of the first water .
lewis acidic defects expand ti ( iv ) active sites to hexa - coordination while inhibit the formation of hepta - coordinated sn ( iv ) species .
two forms of brphinsted acidic defects exist for sn ( iv ) sites instead of only one for ti ( iv ) sites , and all m ( iv ) brphinsted acidic defects , regardless of different acidic forms and m ( iv ) ions , can chemisorb only one water .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction in the past few decades , m ( iv ) - incorporated zeolites have gained enough attention1 - 3 .
the discovery of titanium silicate - 1 ( ts - 1 ) in 19834 has been regarded as a milestone in heterogeneous catalysis5 and other ti ( iv ) - containing zeolites such as ti - mww , ssz - 24 and ti - utl were subsequently developed that also exhibit satisfying catalytic effects for a wide spectrum of substrates6 - 10 .
corma , prech and their collaborators11,12 reported that sn - bea zeolite is an efficient catalyst for the baeyer - villiger oxidation reactions .
as a matter of fact , sn - and zr - bea zeolites are also known to exhibit superior catalytic performances for the transformation of cellulosic biomass to downstream chemicals and fuels3,13 - 15 .
albeit less used for catalytic applications , ge ( iv ) ions introduced into the framework of zeolites have the directing effect that results in the formation of itq - 24 , icp - 2 and other new structures , and the ador ( assembly - disassembly - organization - reassembly ) mechanism was posed for the synthesis processes16,17 .
isolated and well - defined m ( iv ) sites have been acknowledged as the active sites of m ( iv ) - incorporated zeolites1 - 3,5,13 - 15,18 - 20 .
as testified by density functional and two - layer oniom calculations , m ( iv ) ions exhibit outstanding adsorption performances for a variety of probe molecules such as h2o , nh3 and amino acids21 - 40 .
the ti - peroxo species in ts - 1 zeolite produced from the interaction of ti ( iv ) sites and h2o2 are the active sites for alkene epoxidation41 - 57 , and wells et al.48 demonstrated that ti ( iv ) sites adjacent to si vacancies [( osio3 ) 3tioh ] are more reactive ; that is , the epoxidation processes are significantly accelerated by defects .
the two ti ( iv ) species [ i.e. , ti ( osio3 ) 4 and ( osio3 ) 3tioh ] were identified in ts - 1 zeolite49,50 and sn ( iv ) analogues were proposed for sn - bea zeolite51 - 53 .
defects in sn - bea zeolite were reported to play a significant promoting effect during the transformation of cellulosic biomass54 - 60 .
active sites are one of the central topics for adsorption and catalysis , while a number of key issues remain enigmatic for m ( iv ) - incorporated zeolites ; e.g. , we are not clear which causes the differences of active sites in sn - bea and ts - 1 zeolites , topology of zeolites or identity of m ( iv ) ions .
the active sites of sn - bea zeolite were assigned to be octahedral sn ( iv ) species composed by tetrahedral sn ( iv ) sites and two water molecules61 , while the ti ( iv ) active sites in ts - 1 zeolite prefer to being five - coordinated upon water adsorption62 .
in this work , periodic density functional theory ( p - dft ) calculations were conducted to have a comprehensive understanding of m ( iv ) active sites and their coordination numbers in m ( iv ) - incorporated zeolites , considering the effects such as topology of zeolites ( bea , fer , cha ) , identity of m ( iv ) ions ( m = sn , ti , zr , ge ) , type of framework species ( m p , m l , m b , see fig. 1 ) and choice of crystallographically distinct t sites : ( 1 ) m2 ( iv ) active sites in bea zeolites containing the various m ( iv ) ions ( m = sn , ti , zr , ge ) .
the second water that forms only h - bonds promotes chemisorption of the first water and has comparable or even larger adsorption energies ; ( 2 ) m9 ( iv ) and m6 ( iv ) active sites in bea zeolites , where sn ( iv ) and zr ( iv ) active sites are hexa - coordinated while ti ( iv ) and ge ( iv ) active sites remain penta - coordinated ; ( 3 ) m ( iv ) - bea zeolites with adsorption of three and four water molecules .
the third water at m2 ( iv ) sites continues to promote chemisorption of the first water while subsequent adsorption may play an adverse effect .
sn ( iv ) and zr ( iv ) active sites are potentially expanded to hepta - coordination ; ( 4 ) m ( iv ) - cha and m ( iv ) - fer zeolites .
different from other zeolites , ti ( iv ) active sites in fer zeolites prefer to being hexa - coordinated as sn ( iv ) active sites ; ( 5 ) lewis acidic defects in m ( iv ) - bea zeolites , which produce significantly beneficial effects for water adsorption .
the coordination number of ti ( iv ) sites is expanded to six while the hepta - coordinated sn ( iv ) species is inhibited ; ( 6 ) brphinsted acidic defects , which promote chemisorption for the first water while prevents the second water from chemisorption .
a second form of brphinsted acidic defects with higher stability was detected in sn - bea zeolite that shows distinct adsorption properties .
results obtained thus far are beneficial to understand the structural , adsorption and coordination aspects of m ( iv ) - incorporated zeolites and to decipher the active sites that are critical to adsorption and catalytic processes .

computational details models atomic coordinates of zeolites were downloaded from the international zeolite association ( iza ) website63 .
the periodic models of m ( iv ) - bea , m ( iv ) - fer and m ( iv ) - cha zeolites as used previously39 were displayed in fig. 2 , wherein m ( iv ) - fer and m ( iv ) - cha consist of two and four unit cells along the c ( 1 x 1 x 2 ) and a x b ( 1 x 2 x 2 ) lattice vectors , respectively .
different from cha and fer zeolites where all t sites are indistinguishable ( referred to as t1 ) , bea possesses nine crystallographically distinct t sites , and as recommended elsewhere28 - 30,33,35,38,39,53 - 61 , t2 site that is the most energetically favorable and t9 and t6 sites that are situated at the intersection of two channels were investigated .

lewis and brphinsted acidic defects in m ( iv ) - incorporated zeolites were given in figs 1 and 3 .
lewis acidic defects ( m l ) were constructed by removing a neighboring si atom as well as its first - shell three si atoms26,34,48 - 50,55 , while brphinsted acidic defects ( m b ) were created with the formation of the = m ( oh ) 2si = linkage31,53,58,64 .

methods the perdew , burke and ernzrhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional65,66 supplemented with the damped c6 dispersion term67 ( referred to as dft - d2 , implemented in the vasp software ) was used .
the standard paw ( projected augmented wave ) psuedopotentials were used for all elements , while m ( iv ) ions are exceptions that were handled by the highest electronic paw pseudopotentials ( sn _ d for sn , ti _ pv for ti , zr _ sv for zr and ge _ d for ge ) , in that their semi - core s , p or d states should be regarded as valence electrons33,37,39,55,68 .
the energy cutoff was 400.0 ev , and the brillouin zone sampling was restricted to gamma - point .
structural optimizations finished when the forces on each atom are below 0.05 ev a - 1 .

noting that the e ad2 calculations were based on the lower - energy mzeo - h2o configurations ( e.g. , sn9 p b rather than sn9 p a due to the larger e ad1 value and higher stability , see table 1 ) .

results and discussion as illustrated in fig. 4 , water can approach some t sites of zeolites via different directions that are represented by " a " , " b " and " c " .
nomenclature of adsorption configurations includes such information as m ( iv ) species ( m p , m l , m b , see fig. 1 ) , number of t sites ( 1 ~ 9 ) and direction of water adsorption ( a , b , c ) ; e.g. , m9 p ab ( fig. 5 ) in bea zeolite stands for the adsorption configuration where two water molecules approach the perfectly tetrahedral m9 ( iv ) site via " a " and " b " directions ( m = sn , ti , zr , ge ) .
adsorption configurations where water is assumed to form h - bonds with other water molecules and framework - o atoms ( referred to as of ) are suffixed by hi ( i = 1 , 2 , ...) , see m2 p h1 in fig. 5 for instance .
figure 4 ( a ) two and ( b ) potential directions present for water molecules to approach the m ( iv ) sites within zeolites .
different directions are referred to as " a " , " b " and " c " that are colored in semitransparent pink , yellow and green , respectively .
figure 5 local configurations of water adsorption at defect - free m2 ( iv ) , m9 ( iv ) and m6 ( iv ) sites of bea zeolites , where m = sn , ti , zr , ge .
ow2 in m2 p h1 refers to the water molecule that is stabilized mainly by h - bonds .
m ( iv ) 2 sites in defect - free bea zeolite the local adsorption configurations of water at defect - free m2 ( iv ) - bea zeolites are shown in fig. 5 ( m2 p a ) , and the m - owa distances and adsorption energies ( e ad1 ) are given in table 1 .
the m - owa distances are 2.356 , 2.365 , 2.542 and 2.425 a respectively for m = ti , sn , ge and zr , in line with previous reports21 - 23,25 - 38 and indicative of chemisorption .
although with a smaller radius than sn ( iv ) ( 0.53 a vs. 0.71 a ) , ge ( iv ) corresponds to larger m - owa distances suggesting inferior interactions .
the adsorption energies of water ( e ad1 ) are calculated at - 44.9 , - 64.4 , - 27.9 and - 64.8 kj / mol respectively for m = ti , sn , ge and zr , and the interaction strengths within ge2 ( iv ) - bea zeolite are almost at the level of all - siliceous zeolite ( - 20.3 kj / mol ) .
the adsorption performances of m ( iv ) - bea zeolites are in line with their catalytic effects ( zr =~ sn > ti > ge ) 2,3,13 - 15 , including the results of two - dimensional zeolites available69 .
the thermodynamic changes for the hydrolysis of m - o bonds fall within the range of 63.8 ~ 73.9 kj / mol , which are obviously lower than that of all - siliceous zeolite ( 106.2 kj / mol ) and indicate the less stability and more likelihood of forming defects due to m ( iv ) incorporation .
m ( iv ) 2 sites are situated at the straight channel of bea zeolite and it is assumed that only one water can be chemisorbed , as testified by adsorption of the second water that forms h - bonds with the first water and of atoms , see m2 p h1 in fig. 5. accordingly , all m ( iv ) 2 active sites are penta - coordinated with adsorption of one water .
strong h - bonds are constructed between two adsorbed water molecules and the owah *** ow2 distances are 1.684 , 1.607 , 1.664 and 1.658 a respectively for m = ti , sn , ge and zr. the second water is further stabilized by three h - bonds with of atoms ; e.g. , the ow2h *** of h - bonds in sn2 p h1 are 2.005 , 2.327 and 2.765 a. interestingly , its presence promotes the interaction of m2 ( iv ) sites with the first water , since the m - owa distances are respectively 2.255 , 2.267 , 2.212 and 2.352 a for m = ti , sn , ge and zr and all are shorter than those of m2 p a ( table 1 ) .
as a synergy of the two effects , the adsorption energies of the second water in m2 p h1 ( e ad2 ) are substantial and amount to - 58.6 , - 67.1 , - 53.0 and - 62.1 kj / mol respectively for m = ti , sn , ge and zr , which are comparable to , if not larger than , the e ad1 values of m2 p a where water is chemisorbed ; in addition , the e ad2 values are close for all m ( iv ) ions and are not so dependent on the identify of m ( iv ) ions as those of chemisorbed water ( e ad1 ) .
m ( iv ) 9 and m ( iv ) 6 sites in defect - free bea zeolite m ( iv ) 9 sites in bea zeolite are at the intersection of two channels and can be approached by water via either " a " or " b " direction , see figs 4 and 5 ( m9 p a and m9 p b ) 33 .
for a specific m ( iv ) ion , the m - owa and m - owb distances are close to each other suggesting comparable interactions from two directions , as corroborated by the calculated adsorption energies ( e ad1 , table 1 ) .
when two water molecules via " a " and " b " directions approach the m9 ( iv ) sites of m9 ( iv ) - bea zeolites at the same time , both of them construct direct bonds with sn9 ( iv ) and zr9 ( iv ) sites while only one remains chemisorbed for ti9 ( iv ) and ge9 ( iv ) sites , see fig. 5 ( sn9 p ab and ti9 p ab ). that is , the coordination numbers of sn9 ( iv ) , zr9 ( iv ) and ti9 ( iv ) , ge9 ( iv ) active sites are expanded respectively to six and five , in line with the results of dynamic nuclear polarization surface enhanced nmr spectra of sn - bea zeolite and ( resonant ) valence - to - core x - ray emission spectra of ts - 1 zeolite61,62 .
the adsorption energies of the second water ( e ad2 ) in m9 p ab are calculated to be - 19.0 , - 42.6 , - 20.5 and - 61.0 kj / mol respectively for m = ti , sn , ge and zr , consistent with the changing trends of m - ow distances ( table 1 ) .
owing to competition of two chemisorbed water , the e ad2 values in sn9 p ab and zr9 p ab reduce to some extent as compared to the e ad1 values , while the e ad2 value of ti9 p ab due to mainly h - bonding interactions descends substantially and is close to those of all - siliceous zeolite ( table 1 ) .
m ( iv ) 6 sites at the intersection of bea zeolite are also investigated that substantialize the results of m9 ( iv ) sites : sn6 ( iv ) and ti6 ( iv ) sites can chemisorb at most two and one water molecules , respectively , see their local structures in fig. 5 ( sn6 p ab and ti6 p ab ) and geometric and energetic data in table 1. that is , sn6 ( iv ) active sites adopt the octahedral geometry with adsorption of two water molecules while ti6 ( iv ) active sites are penta - coordinated with adsorption of one water .
adsorption with more water molecules figure 6 depicts the local configurations of sn2 ( iv ) - bea zeolite adsorbed with three ( sn2 p h2 ) and four ( sn2 p h3 ) water molecules .
in sn2 p h2 , the second and third water molecules are located at either side of the chemisorbed one and their chemical environments resemble each other .
the owah *** ow3 and three ow3h *** of h - bonds are 1.603 a and 2.134 , 2.163 , 2.961 a , respectively .
the sn2 - owa distance in sn2 p h2 equals 2.186 a and is further shortened than in sn2 p h1 ( 2.267 a ) ; nonetheless , e ad3 ( - 64.2 kj / mol ) decreases slightly as compared to e ad2 , due to the inferior h - bonding interactions as reflected by their distances .
the e ad4 value ( - 33.5 kj / mol ) of sn2 p h3 shows considerable reductions albeit the fourth water also constructs h - bonds with the chemisorbed water , due to the obviously weaker h - bonding interactions ; e.g. , the ow4h *** owa distance equals 1.971 a and is apparently longer than those of the second and third water molecules .
subsequent adsorption constructs the second , third and higher - order water shells around the chemisorbed one , which will not be discussed here .
figure 6 local adsorption configurations for three and four water molecules within defect - free sn2 ( iv ) - bea zeolite .
ow3 and ow4 refer to the water molecules that are stabilized mainly by h - bonds .
h - bonded adsorption configurations of sn9 ( iv ) site are shown in fig. 7 ( sn9 p h1 and sn9 p h2 ) that resemble the condition of sn2 ( iv ) site .
the third water in sn9 h1 rather than in sn9 h2 is more stabilized by h - bonds , and the owah *** ow3 and owbh *** ow3 distances are optimized at 1.677 and 2.151 a , respectively .
the third water in sn9 h1 facilitates the chemisorption of associated water ( sn9 - owa : 2.289 a in sn9 h1 vs. 2.402 a in sn9 p ab ) while in sn9 p h2 plays an adverse effect for the chemisorption of associated water ( sn9 - owb : 2.425 a in sn9 p h2 vs. 2.354 a in sn9 p ab ) .
as a result , the adsorption energies of the third water ( e ad3 ) differ markedly for sn9 p h1 and sn9 p h2 that amount to - 61.2 and - 26.9 kj / mol , respectively .
it is interesting to find that three water molecules can also be simultaneously chemisorbed at sn9 ( iv ) site with elongated sn - ow distances ( 2.665 , 2.558 and 2.409 a ) 70 , see sn9 p abi in fig. 7 and table 2 .
however , the e ad3 value of sn9 p abi equals - 26.6 kj / mol and is apparently less than that of sn9 h1. that is , the coordination number of sn9 ( iv ) site in bea zeolite should predominate as six although potentially expanded to seven .
parallel p - dft calculations are conducted for zr9 ( iv ) - bea zeolite and it indicates that its coordination number can also be expanded to seven with the zr - ow distances of 2.518 , 2.518 and 2.454 a ( table 2 ) .
the e ad3 difference of zr9 p abi vs. zr9 p h1 ( - 36.5 vs. - 59.8 kj / mol ) is less than that of sn9 p abi vs. sn9 p h1 , suggesting that zr9 ( iv ) - bea zeolite has a greater possibility of developing the hepta - coordination mode .

defect - free cha and fer zeolites figure 8 and table 3 indicate that water can approach m ( iv ) sites of cha zeolite from three different directions (" a " , " b " and " c " as shown in fig. 4 ) .
each direction in sn ( iv ) - cha zeolite results in the formation of direct sn - ow bonds ( sn - owa : 2.492 a ; sn - owb : 2.395 a ; sn - owc : 2.443 a ) while only two directions in ti ( iv ) - cha zeolite can be chemisorbed with water ( ti - owa : 2.905 a ; ti - owb : 2.371 a ; ti - owc : 2.414 a ) 21 - 23,25 - 28,31 - 33 , where the ti - owa distance is apparently longer .
the adsorption energies of three directions ( e ad1 ) differ remarkably and are maximal for m1 p b with the values being - 72.3 and - 57.1 kj / mol for m = sn and ti , respectively ( table 3 ) .
for adsorption of two water molecules in sn ( iv ) - cha zeolite , sn1 p ab remains hexa - coordinated ( sn - ow : 2.457 and 2.261 a ) while sn1 p ac ( sn - ow : 2.565 and 3.033 a ) and sn1 p bc ( sn - ow : 2.307 and 3.524 a ) transform to penta - coordination .
instead , all adsorption configurations of ti ( iv ) - cha zeolite are presented as penta - coordination including the one corresponding to sn1 p ab ( i.e. , ti1 p ab with ti - ow distances of 3.699 and 2.347 a ) .
chemisorption of three water molecules in sn ( iv ) - cha zeolite seems impossible , see the optimized structure ( sn1 p abc ) in fig. 8. in consequence , sn ( iv ) and ti ( iv ) active sites of cha zeolites are respectively hexa - and penta - coordinated that resemble the condition of bea zeolites .

water can be chemisorbed at the m ( iv ) sites of fer zeolite from two different directions referred to as " a " and " b " , and the sn - owa , ti - owa , sn - owb and ti - owb distances in sn1 p a , ti1 p a , sn1 p b and ti1 p b are respectively 2.398 , 2.392 , 2.398 and 2.449 a. chemisorption of two water molecules is viable in sn ( iv ) - fer zeolite as in sn ( iv ) - bea and sn ( iv ) - cha zeolites ( sn - ow : 2.379 and 2.392 a ) , implying that chemisorption of the first water facilitates the interaction of the second water as verified subsequently .
it is surprising to find that two water molecules can be chemisorbed at the ti ( iv ) sites of fer zeolite , and the ti - owa and ti - owb distances in ti1 p ab are 2.365 and 2.419 a that are also shorter than those adsorbed with one water ( table 3 ) .
accordingly , both sn ( iv ) and ti ( iv ) active sites in fer zeolites adopt the octahedral geometry with adsorption of two water molecules .
as indicated in table 3 , the adsorption energies of the second water ( e ad2 ) are comparable to those of the first water ( e ad1 ) from the same direction ( e.g. , " b " direction for ti1 p ab and ti1 p b ) .

chemisorption of the second water causes the omegamin and psimin values to again get close to each other and reduce pronouncedly due to the formation of octahedral geometry61 , see the omegamin and psimin values for sn9 ( iv ) sites of bea zeolite in table 4 .
in m ( iv ) - fer zeolites , however , both omegamin and psimin decline due to adsorption of the first water although to an apparently less extent for the other direction with no water ( table 4 ) , and the smaller dihedral of the other direction indicates that adsorption of the first water facilitates the accessibility of the second water towards m ( iv ) sites , which is distinct from the condition of other zeolites .
it thus deciphers why two water molecules can be chemisorbed at ti ( iv ) sites of fer rather than other zeolites .

lewis acidic defects defects have been implicated to be critical for catalytic reactions54 - 60 , and is this effect associated , at least in part , with alteration of the active sites ?
the adsorption configurations of water at m9 ( iv ) lewis acidic defects ( m9 l ) of bea zeolites are shown in fig. 10. water can approach m9 ( iv ) lewis acidic defects from " a " and " b " directions as in the condition of perfectly tetrahedral sites ( m9 p ) while interactions are reinforced ( table 5 ) ; e.g. , the adsorption energies ( e ad1 ) are - 85.1 and - 89.1 kj / mol respectively for sn9 l a and sn9 l b and surpass those of sn9 p a and sn9 p b ( table 1 ) 49,55 .
more significant promotion effects of lewis acidic defects are detected during adsorption of the second water : the e ad2 value in sn9 l ab equals - 78.6 kj / mol and is even larger than the e ad1 values of perfectly tetrahedral sites .
two water molecules can be chemisorbed at ti9 ( iv ) lewis acidic defects ( ti - ow distances of ti9 l ab : 2.278 and 2.233 a ) , and the e ad2 value ( - 55.0 kj / mol ) surpasses the e ad1 values of perfectly tetrahedral ti9 ( iv ) sites ( table 1 ) , which agree with the results of sn9 ( iv ) lewis acidic defects .
the adsorption configurations of three water molecules at sn9 ( iv ) lewis acidic defects ( fig. 11 ) are close to those of perfectly tetrahedral sites , and the e ad3 values are calculated at - 16.6 and - 66.0 kj / mol for sn9 l abi and sn9 l h1 , respectively ( table 2 ) .
accordingly , lewis acidic defects inhibit somewhat the formation of hepta - coordinated sn9 ( iv ) species ( chemisorption of three water molecules is also tried for ti9 ( iv ) lewis acidic defects , while only two water molecules remain bonded and the third water forms h - bonds with other water molecules and of atoms , see fig. 11 ( ti9labi )) .

in ti9 l abi , three water molecules are assumed to form direct bonds as in sn9 l abi .
table 6 lists the root - mean - square deviations ( rmsd ) of local m ( iv ) sites during water adsorption .
for each m ( iv ) site , rmsds generally increase with the number of chemisorbed water molecules , implying larger structural perturbations ; in addition , at a specific chemisorbed water content , lewis acidic defects always result in obviously higher rmsds than corresponding perfectly tetrahedral sites ; e.g. , the rmsds are calculated to be 0.20 and 0.24 a in sn9 p a and sn9 p ab while are enlarged to 0.34 and 0.47 a in sn9 l a and sn9 l ab , respectively .
accordingly , the more structural flexibility of lewis acidic defects facilitates the interaction with water and allows the formation of hexa - coordinated ti ( iv ) species in bea zeolite .

brphinsted acidic defects the adsorption configurations of nh3 at defect m9 b of bea zeolite with the = m ( oh ) 2si = linkage ( figs 1 and 3 ) are given in fig. 12. defect m9 b in bea zeolite transfers the proton to nh3 automatically forming nh4 + and thus shows brphinsted acidity , which are in line with the results of m ( iv ) - incorporated mfi zeolites32,64 .
the bridging hydroxyls of defect m b significantly accelerate the isomerization reaction of glucose to fructose58 .
figure 13 depicts the adsorption configurations of water at m9 ( iv ) brphinsted acidic defects of bea zeolites , with structural parameters and adsorption energies ( e adn ) being listed in table 7 .
the m - ob and si - ob distances are altered but not markedly during water adsorption .
the si - ob distances are obviously elongated than in perfectly tetrahedral si ( iv ) sites ( ca .
1.62 a ) while m ( iv ) sites remain tightly bonded with two bridging ob atoms .
sn9 b a is an exception where the si - ob2 bond is ruptured and the sn - ob distances reduce considerably .
the m - ow distances in m9 b b are shorter than in perfectly tetrahedral m ( iv ) sites and hence interactions with water are enhanced as verified by adsorption energies ( e.g. , e ad1 = - 91.3 kj / mol for sn9 b b vs. - 74.2 kj / mol for sn9 p b ) .
formation of brphinsted acidic defects ( m b ) facilitates the accessibility of water to m ( iv ) sites as reflected by the significantly smaller dihedrals than in perfectly tetrahedral sites : the of3ob1ob2m dihedrals ( fig. 3 ) are 10.06degrees and 10.78degrees respectively for sn9 b and ti9 b. however , limited space is available for the second water and as a result , water from " a " direction forms only h - bonds instead of being chemisorbed : the ob1hb1 *** owa and owah *** of h - bonds are respectively 1.499 and 1.918 , 2.836 , 2.670 a in sn9 b a while 1.662 and 2.139 , 2.573 a in ti9 b a , and stronger ob1hb1 *** owa h - bond in sn9 b a results from higher brphinsted acidity32 that agrees with larger ob1 - hb1 distances ( 1.053 vs. 1.011 a ) .
the e ad1 values are - 101.3 and - 69.2 kj / mol respectively for sn9 b a and ti9 b a , and structural distortions in sn9 b a may facilitate the interactions as testified subsequently .
for both sn9 b ab and ti9 b ab , one water is chemisorbed while the other is h - bonded .

both sn9 b ' ab and sn9 b ' ba are adsorption configurations with two water molecules while the chemisorbed water are from the " a " and " b " directions , respectively .

bthe adsorption energy based on sn9 b a is calculated to be - 78.5 kj / mol .
cdata for sn9 b'ba are given in brackets .
dthe adsorption energies of the second water ( e ad2 ) in sn9 b'ab and sn9 b ' ba are calculated on basis of sn9 b'a and sn9 b'b , respectively .
the si - ob2 bond in sn9 b a is broken , and such defect referred to as sn9 b ' also exists in sn ( iv ) - bea zeolite .
in addition , sn9 b ' is more stable than sn9 b and their energy difference equals - 22.8 kj / mol ; however , ti9 b ' is non - existent and spontaneously transforms to ti9 b. the ob2hb2 group in sn9 b ' is flexible and allows water chemisorption from either " a " or " b " direction , see sn9 b ' a and sn9 b ' b in fig. 13. chemisorption of water from " b " direction causes structural reconstruction to resemble sn9 b b. the adsorption energies ( e ad1 ) in sn9 b ' a and sn9 b ' b are respectively - 8.5 and - 68.5 kj / mol , and the particularly small value in sn9 b ' a is caused by the serious structural distortion in order to accommodate the chemisorbed water .
accordingly , water from " a " direction of sn9 b ' should be preferentially the h - bonded adsorption configuration ( i.e. , sn9 b a ) , and the e ad1 value calculated this way amounts to - 78.5 kj / mol ( table 7 ) .
similar to the condition of sn9 b , only one water can be chemisorbed at sn9 b ' , see fig. 13 ( sn9 b ' ab and sn9 b ' ba where water is chemisorbed from " a " " b " directions , respectively ) .
accordingly , m ( iv ) brphinsted acidic defects , for both acidic forms and different m ( iv ) ions , result in only the hexa - coordination mode with chemisorption of one water .
conclusions periodic density functional theory ( p - dft ) calculations have been used to comprehensively investigate the active sites of m ( iv ) - incorporated zeolites , considering the identity of m ( iv ) ions , topology of zeolites , type of framework species and choice of t sites. with regard to defect - free bea zeolites , all m ( iv ) active sites are penta - coordinated with chemisorption of one water when situated at the straight channel while divergences arise when situated at the intersection : sn ( iv ) and zr ( iv ) active sites predominate as hexa - coordination while ti ( iv ) and ge ( iv ) active sites remain penta - coordinated ; in addition , it is surprising to find that sn ( iv ) and zr ( iv ) are potentially expanded to hepta - coordination although with relatively small probabilities .
for m2 ( iv ) sites , the second and third water molecules form strong h - bonds with chemisorbed water and framework - o atoms and promote the interaction of chemisorbed water .
the adsorption energies of the second water , irrelevant of the identity of m ( iv ) ions , are comparable to , if not larger than , those of chemisorbed water , while those of the third and fourth water molecules , especially the latter , show reduction .
results of cha zeolites , where water can approach m ( iv ) sites from three directions , are similar to those of bea zeolites : sn ( iv ) active sites are hexa - coordinated while ti ( iv ) active sites are penta - coordinated .
sn ( iv ) active sites in fer zeolite adopt the hexa - coordination mode as in the condition of other zeolites , while it is surprising to find that ti ( iv ) active sites are also presented as hexa - coordination .
chemisorption of the first water at m ( iv ) sites of fer zeolites facilitates the interaction with the second water , as verified by the dihedral analyses .
owing to enhanced structural flexibility , lewis acidic defects reinforce the adsorption of water and the promoting effects are more obvious during chemisorption of the second water ; in addition , ti ( iv ) lewis acidic defects can be expanded to hexa - coordination , while hepta - coordinated sn9 ( iv ) species is somewhat inhibited .
m ( iv ) brphinsted acidic defects also facilitate the interaction of the first water while present the second water from chemisorption .
a second form of brphinsted acidic defects that has higher stability exists in sn ( iv ) - rather than ti ( iv ) - bea zeolites .
two forms of sn ( iv ) brphinsted acidic defects show divergent adsorption properties and can be inter - converted during water adsorption .
despite that , all m ( iv ) brphinsted acidic defects are hexa - coordinated , irrespective of different m ( iv ) ions or acidic forms , due to limited space available for the second water .

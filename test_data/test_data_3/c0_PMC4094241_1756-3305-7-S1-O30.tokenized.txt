after the emergence of west nile virus ( wnv ) in 2008 , entomological studies were implemented .
here we describe how entomological data were managed to optimize surveillance and control of mosquito - borne pathogens .
cdc - co2 traps were used ( may - october , 2009 - 2013 ) .
in one site , captures with cdc and gravid traps were organized every 2hrs for 24hrs .
in other three sites pre - and post - disinfestation captures were done .
the mosquitoes were screened by rt - pcr for flaviviridae and a sub - sample for bunyaviridae .
host preference of culex pipiens was assessed by pcr blood meal analysis .
mapping , modelling and spatial analyses were done using entomological data to identify correlations with climate , landscape , animal and human infections .
more than 700,000 mosquitoes were collected , with cx.pipiens the most abundant ( 80 %) and the only vector of wnv and usuv .
tahyna virus was isolated once in ochlerotatus caspius .
cx.pipiens fed preferentially on birds ( 76 %) , mainly blackbird , sparrow , magpie and collared dove , but not on humans .
diel activity showed that cx.pipiens changed its host searching activity according to the season and defined the favorite period for oviposition .
the success of disinfestation measures in reducing cx.pipiens density varied according to the methods used .
the contribution of density - dependence in regulating vector population growth resulted greater than any environmental factor on its own .
overall the most significant predictors of cx.pipiens dynamics included length of daylight , population density and temperature in the 15 days prior to sampling .
precipitation , number of rainy days and humidity had limited importance .
linear models detected significant relationships between wnv in humans and mosquitoes .
spatial analysis detected clusters of wnv occurrences for all the hosts , identifying an area where to focus surveillance and promptly detect wnv re - activation .
in long term studies the mosquito species composition , seasonality , distribution , abundance and pathogen rate of infections were assessed .
the blood - meal analyses indicated possible bird targets for surveillance .
the control of the efficacy of disinfestations highlighted the need for harmonic guidelines .
modelling indicated the need to incorporate density dependence in combination with key environmental factors for robust prediction of cx.pipiens population expansion , helping to identify when and where an increase in vector population size and wnv transmission risk should be expected .
the results stressed also the necessity to improve the density and the frequency of mosquito captures .

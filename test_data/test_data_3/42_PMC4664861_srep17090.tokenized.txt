many perennial crops including hop ( humulus lupulus ) are routinely plagued by t. urticae infestations .
hop is a specialty crop in pacific northwest states , where 99 % of all u.s. hops are produced .
to suppress t. urticae , growers often apply various acaricides .
unfortunately t. urticae has been documented to quickly develop resistance to these acaricides which directly cause control failures .
here , we investigated resistance ratios and distribution of multiple resistance - associated mutations in field collected t. urticae samples compared with a susceptible population .
our research revealed that a mutation in the cytochrome b gene ( g126s ) in 35 % tested t. urticae populations and a mutation in the voltage - gated sodium channel gene ( f1538i ) in 66.7 % populations may contribute resistance to bifenazate and bifenthrin , respectively .
no mutations were detected in glutamate - gated chloride channel subunits tested , suggesting target site insensitivity may not be important in our hop t. urticae resistance to abamectin .
however , p450 - mediated detoxification was observed and is a putative mechanism for abamectin resistance .
molecular mechanisms of t. urticae chemical adaptation in hopyards is imperative new information that will help growers develop effective and sustainable management strategies .
as a flavoring and stability ingredient in beer , hop ( humulus lupulus ) is an economically important crop in the pacific northwest ( pnw ) of the united states .
the u.s. hop industry is concentrated in the three pnw states , washington , oregon , and idaho , which represent over 99 % of the nation's1 and 30 % of the world's2 hop acreage in 2013 .
the preliminary production of the u.s. hops crop was valued at $ 249 million in 20131 .
hop is a dioeciously perennial specialty crop that is planted in female monoculture3 .
hops bloom in the pnw initiated by long days , and un - pollinated flowers develop into cones that ripen between mid - august to mid - september .
the commercial products from hops are resin and hop oil extracted from the lupulin gland of the hop cone4 .
in the state of washington hops are only grown commercially in the yakima valley including three distinct growing areas : the moxee valley , the yakama indian reservation , and the lower yakima valley .
each of these areas are within a 50 - mile radius ( 80 kilometers ) of each other in shrub - steppe habitats characterized by low annual winter precipitation and hot dry summers .
climate , experienced growers , established infrastructure , and modern drip irrigation techniques enhance optimal hop production in the yakima valley and make it among the most productive hop growing regions in the world5 .
in 2013 , washington growers produced 79 % of the u.s. hops crop1 .
integrated pest management strategies have been developed to optimize production of high - quality hops6 .
to date , several plant pathogens and arthropods have been reported as pests of hops in the pnw6 .
among these , tetranychus urticae is the most serious and prevalent arthropod pest in warmer dry climates67 and efficient control of this pest is a priority for the hop industry .
in most situations , hops growers apply various acaricides to suppress t. urticae populations .
grower records indicate that up to nine pesticides were used over the course of the hop growing seasons each year in 2012 and 20138 .
these pesticides include several classes of acaricides with different modes of action .
unfortunately t. urticae has been documented to quickly develop tolerance and resistance to these acaricides , which has been linked to control failures6 .
the accelerated development of resistance in t. urticae is not only due to the extensive exposure to acaricides , but is also exacerbated by the biology of t. urticae , including an extremely short life span with relatively high fecundity , and arrhenotokous reproduction910 .
as its name implies , t. urticae is able to produce webs from silk glands located at each palp11 .
the webbings made by t. urticae may work as a shelter to avoid pesticide exposure and protect it from other life - threatening conditions including wind , rain , and natural enemies12 .
moreover , t. urticae undergoes diapause in soil , tree bark , ground cover and dried leaves when decreasing temperature , photoperiod , and decline in the quality of food supply occur due to plant senescence13 .
diapause facilitates t. urticae adaptation to the agroecosystem and offers a refuge to escape pesticide exposure .
indeed , the two - spotted spider mite has been reported to be the world 's most resistant arthropod ; this species has been found to be resistant to 94 unique insecticide / acaricide active ingredients in 468 documented cases worldwide1415 .
the mechanisms of pesticide resistance exhibited by arthropods typically evolve along several trajectories , including behavioral avoidance16 , decreased cuticular penetration17 , enhanced sequestration or metabolic detoxification18 , and target site insensitivity192021 .
among these , target site insensitivity to acaricides in t. urticae have been investigated extensively2223 .
for example , several mutations in the acetylcholinesterase ( ache ) gene have been documented in organophosphate resistant t. urticae strains from europe and korea2425 .
two mutations were identified in the glutamate - gated chloride channel ( glucl ) genes that are correlated with abamectin resistance in t. urticae populations2326 .
studies reported that resistance to bifenazate commonly used for t. urticae control was tightly linked to multiple mutations at the quinol oxidation ( qo ) site of mitochondrial cytochrome b ( cytb ) 2728 .
pyrethroid resistance in t. urticae has been associated with several amino acid substitutions in the voltage - gated sodium channel ( vgsc ) gene2930 .
additionally , recent studies revealed that a mutation on the chitin synthase gene may contribute to resistance to etoxazole31 , hexythiazox , and clofentezine32 in t. urticae .
in order to design the most effective and sustainable t. urticae management strategy , our long - term goals include revealing the mechanisms underlying the chemical adaptation of t. urticae in the field .
we initially calculated the baseline concentration response curves of t. urticae population susceptible to three acaricides : abamectin , bifenazate , and bifenthrin .
we chose these three compounds because they are currently the most commonly used acaricides for t. urticae control in hopyards according to the spray records we investigated ( fig. 1 ) .
recently , field control failures with these acaricides have been observed in the yakima valley of washington state8 .
we collected 31 t. urticae field populations from hopyards in the yakima valley during summer 2013 ( fig. 2 ) and evaluated the acaricide resistance levels in most of these populations compared with a susceptible strain .
we also investigated the distribution pattern of resistance - associated target site mutations in these field collected t. urticae populations .
finally , the relative expressions of several detoxification - related p450 genes in field t. urticae populations were compared with that of the susceptible population .
results baseline toxicity of the lab susceptible population to establish baseline levels of susceptibility and discriminating concentrations for three acaricides , their toxicity was first evaluated in the susceptible t. urticae population .
all acaricides tested caused 100 % mortality of spider mites at concentrations equivalent to the field rates of 23 mg a.i. / l ( abamectin ) , 899 mg a.i. / l ( bifenazate ) and 120 mg a.i. / l ( bifenthrin ) .
probit analysis showed that the dose responses of susceptible t. urticae to these three acaricides are significantly lower than field rates ( table 1 ) .
acaricide resistance levels in field populations the toxicities of abamectin and bifenazate were assessed for t. urticae populations collected from 13 and 12 hopyards , respectively ( tables 2 and 3 ) .
in the bioassays with abamectin , the lc50s ranged from 1.36 to 26.05 mg a.i. / l and the resistant ratios ( rrs ) compared with the susceptible strain varied from 5.96 to 114.25 ( table 2 ) .
low resistance levels ( rr < 10 ) were observed in 10.5 % of the surveyed populations , 10.5 % had high resistance ( rr > 100 ) , and the majority of the surveyed populations ( 79 %) exhibited moderate resistance ( rr = 10 - 100 ) to abamectin ( fig. 3a ) .
the rr of the t. urticae population in the organic hopyard ( granger 2 ) compared with the susceptible population was 11.23 , which is the 3rd lowest resistance among surveyed populations and the highest level of mortality ( 100 %) at the field rate .
samples collected from the granger 4 hopyard showed the lowest resistance ratio ( rr = 5.96 ) compared with the susceptible population .
there were three 1st year ( baby ) hopyards ( prosser 3 , 4 , and 5 ) surveyed in 2013 .
the rrs of samples collected from these baby hopyards ranged from 21.80 to 114.25 , exhibiting a moderate to high degree of resistance ( table 2 ) .
there were multiple collections from certain hopyards ( prosser 2 , 3 and 4 ) during the course of summer 2013 .
specifically , six collections were taken from the prosser 2 hopyard starting from middle of june till just prior to harvest in late august during which abamectin was applied twice10 .
the rr increased 6 - fold from the middle of july to mid - august ( table 2 ) .
the rrs in samples collected from prosser 3 and 4 increased 1.7 - fold and 2.3 - fold in four and five weeks , respectively .
the highest resistance level to abamectin was recorded at the prosser 4 ( rr = 114.25 ) ( table 2 ) .
in the bioassays with bifenazate , the lc50s ranged from 3.93 to 78.97 mg a.i. / l and the rrs varied from 4.79 to 96.30 ( table 3 ) .
populations exhibiting low resistance levels ( rr < 10 ) accounted for 37.5 % of the populations surveyed , and 62.5 % of the populations exhibited moderate resistance ( rr = 10 - 100 ) to bifenazate ( fig. 3b ) .
the lowest rr to bifenazate , 4.79 , was recorded from the samples collected from the organic hopyard ( granger 2 ) .
the rrs of samples collected from the 1st year hopyards showed low to moderate level of resistance ( table 3 ) .
the highest rr to bifenazate was observed in the sample collected from granger 3 ( rr = 96.30 ) ( table 3 ) .
due to the limited number of collected t. urticae individuals in four populations , only the discriminating dose of bifenazate was evaluated ( table 3 ) .
evaluation of target site mutations the occurrence of 16 mutations in four target genes , glucl1 and glucl3 ( target of abamectin ; fig. s1 ) , cytb ( target of bifenazate ; fig. s2 ) , and vgsc ( target of bifenthrin ; fig. s3 ) , was examined in t. urticae field populations by direct sequencing of pcr products. by visual examination of sequencing chromatographs at the mutation sites , we could identify samples that contained wild - type , resistant , or both alleles .
the combination of mutations in field t. urticae populations collected from pnw hopyards exhibited a unique pattern ( table 4 ) .
only two mutations , g126s and f1538i , in cytb and domain iii of vgsc , respectively , were identified ( table 4 ) .
there were no mutations observed in glucl1 , glucl3 , and other region of cytb and vgsc .
no mutations observed in glutamate - gated chloride channel genes inhibitory glutamate - gated chloride channels ( glucls ) , members of the cys - loop ligand - gated ion channel ( cyslgic ) superfamily , are extrajunctional or postsynaptic receptors found in muscle or neural ganglion of most protostome phyla including chelicerates such as t. urticae2333 .
the genome of t. urticae contains six orthologous glucl genes23 .
previous studies revealed that two mutations in two different glucl channel subunits , glucl1 and glucl3 , were related to abamectin resistance in t. urticae2326 .
thus we designed primers to sequence the fragments containing these two mutations ( fig. s1 ) from susceptible and all hop field populations of t. urticae .
surprisingly , there were no mutations identified from the samples tested ( table 4 ) , suggesting target site insensitivity - mediated resistance is not the mechanism leading to the abamectin resistance that we observed in t. urticae field populations .
identification of mutations in the cytb gene recent studies suggested that bifenazate resistance was closely correlated with mutation ( s ) in the mitochondrial cytb27 .
a combination of at least two cd1 helix mutations in the qo pocket ( g126s and i136t or g126s and s141f ) and one mutation in the ef helix of qo pocket ( p262t ) were linked with a high level of bifenazate resistance in t. urticae .
we sequenced an 828 bp fragment of the t. urticae cytb gene , which included the g126 , i136 , s141 , d161 and p262 sites ( fig. s2 ) that have been demonstrated to confer bifenazate resistance in t. urticae27 .
one amino acid substitution , g126s , was detected in t. urticae field populations .
35 % of field samples field samples contained only the resistant allele , 20 % contained both alleles ( g / s ) and 15 % only the susceptible allele ( g ) ( table 4 ; fig. 4a ) .
since the g126s mutation alone only causes low to moderate bifenazate resistance27 , this result is consistent with the bifenazate resistance phenotype observed ( table 3 ) .
identification of mutations in the voltage - gated sodium channel gene the voltage - gated sodium channel ( vgsc ) is an integral transmembrane protein that is responsible for the rapidly rising phase of action potentials on the neuronal membranes .
due to its essential role in electrical signaling , vgsc is the target of several neurotoxins , including pyrethroids and ddt34 .
many amino acid substitutions associated with pyrethroid resistance in arthropods are located in transmembrane segments 4 - 6 of domain ii ( iis4 - iis6 ) including m918 ( super kdr ) , l925 , t929 , l932 , v1010 , l1014 ( kdr ) , and l102430343536 .
one mutation within the intracellular inter linker connecting domains ii and iii ( a1215d ) and one mutation in domain iii ( f1538i ) were detected in a highly bifenthrin resistant t. urticae strain from greece29 .
thus we amplified three fragments of the vgsc from the domain ii , ii - iii inter linker , and domain iii regions ( fig. s3 ) .
we identified only one amino acid substitution , f1538i .
it was observed in 16 out of 24 field samples tested ( 66.7 %) , 12 of which contained both alleles ( f / i ) and 4 of which were only contained the isoleucine substitution ( i ) ( table 4 ; fig. 4b ) .
cytochrome p450 - mediated metabolic detoxification besides target site insensitivity , cytochrome p450 - mediated detoxification had been shown to be one of the most important mechanisms in acaricide resistance of t. urticae373839 .
the genome of t. urticae contains 86 p450 genes .
we examined the relative expression of three p450s , cyp385c4 , cyp389a1 , and cyp392d8 , belonging to the cyp3 , cyp4 , and cyp2 clans , respectively .
we chose these three p450s because they have been shown to exhibit more than two - fold up regulation after switching host plants and their expression patterns have been linked to acaricide resistance in t. urticae9 .
the expressions of these three p450s in five field populations from five major locations were compared with their expressions in the susceptible population .
as shown in fig. 5 , cyp385c4 had significantly higher expression in all five field populations .
however , this increase in expression was not large ( less than two - fold ) .
cyp389a1 only showed significantly higher expression in the prosser 2 population .
the expression of cyp392d8 was strikingly higher in all five field populations , exhibiting levels 5 to 40 - fold higher than the susceptible strain .
it indicates that cyp392d8 may play an important role in acaricide resistance of t. urticae populations in hopyards .
discussion due to a very short residual effectiveness , abamectin has become the predominant acaricide applied to control t. urticae outbreaks in august as the hops near harvest .
annually , approximately 98 % of the hop acreage in washington is treated with abamectin at least once and 80 % is treated at least three times .
the widespread use of abamectin on hops raises the distinct possibility of control failure as a result of resistance. from sampling the same hopyard over multiple time points in the same season , we found increasing levels of abamectin resistance , suggesting selection pressure from abamectin applications was driving increasing resistance .
for instance , multiple collections in the prosser 2 hopyard showed that the rr to abamectin increased 6 - fold from the middle of july to mid - august ( table 2 ) .
the highest lc50s to abamectin were recorded in the moxee 1 and prosser 4 t. urticae populations ( table 2 ) .
however , moxee 1 had only two acaricide applications during 20138 .
the possibility for the reported highest abamectin resistance ratio in moxee 1 could be the entire application history of abamectin in this field that remains unknown .
there may have been high abamectin selective pressure over multiple overwintering populations in this field prior to 2013 .
the high level of abamectin resistance in the prosser 4 population was also unexpected because this sample was collected from the 1st year baby hopyard8 .
prior to planting hops , the crop planted in prosser 4 was concord grapes .
a recent study reported infestation of t. urticae in grape yards and high abamectin resistance in 45 % t. urticae populations from these grape yards in brazil40 .
nevertheless , our previous investigation suggested that t. urticae is not a pest of grape yards in washington state41 and thus we do not expect the fields have been extensively sprayed with abamectin .
however , bradenburg and kennedy42 reported that wind dispersal was a key factor causing the infestations of t. urticae from corn fields to surrounding crops .
thus , the resistant t. urticae populations we detected may have been transported from adjacent crops to the 1st year hopyard through wind dispersal .
glucls together with gamma - aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) - gated channels and histamine - gated chloride channels ( hiscls ) are known targets of the macrocyclic lactones , the avermectins ( including abamectin ) and ivermectins26334344 .
the point mutation g323d in glucl1 was tightly linked to a moderate abamectin resistance ( 17.9 - fold ) in the abar strain26 .
two point mutations , g323d and g326e , in glucl1 and glucl3 , respectively , were identified in a > 2,000 - fold abamectin resistant strain23 .
however , there was no mutation on glucl subunits detected in any hop samples ( table 4 ) , suggesting target site insensitivity is not likely the mechanism involved in resistance to abamectin in t. urticae field populations .
our results are comparable with a study by khajehali et al.45 which found no glucl mutations in 15 t. urticae strains collected from rose greenhouses in the netherlands , although 10 of those strains displayed abamectin resistance .
many recent studies also suggested that abamectin target site mutations are not especially common in t. urticae populations worldwide .
for example , the g326e was detected in only seven out of 51 t. urticae populations sampled from 27 countries and five continents46 .
the g323d mutation was only found in two greek samples in the same survey46 .
in another study with 25 korean t. urticae populations , only one field - collected t. urticae sample contains g323d mutation47 .
previous synergism tests and transcriptomic data indicated that additional mechanisms such as enhanced metabolic detoxification by cytochrome p450s may be implicated in the abamectin resistance phenotype374849 .
a genome microarray analysis revealed several cytochrome p450 genes were up - regulated in an abamectin resistant strain49 .
further evidence confirmed the function of one of these p450s , cyp392a16 , in metabolizing abamectin50 .
unfortunately , this study was published after the completion of our study , and we did not have enough sample material remaining to test for expression of this gene .
however , of the three p450s we did examine in our study , one clan 2 p450 , cyp392d8 , showed constitutive over - expression in all five field collected samples compared to the susceptible population , indicating its potential function in abamectin resistance ( fig. 5 ) .
bifenazate is a hydrazine carbazate acaricide that was discovered in 1990 by uniroyal chemical and first registered in the state of washington in 2002851 .
because of the quick knockdown and long residual effects on many economically important phytophagous mite species and low toxicity on predatory mites and beneficial insects , bifenazate is widely used as a selective acaricide to control t. urticae in hopyards .
our bioassay data demonstrated that the majority of field t. urticae populations ( 62.5 %) in hopyards exhibit moderate levels of resistance to bifenazate ( fig. 3b ) .
our target site mutation screening revealed that a mutation g126s on cytb gene occurs in 35 % of t. urticae populations ( fig. 4a ) .
it should be noted that g126s ( gga to aga ) is the same mutation as described in previous studies2728 .
g126s is the most common substitution on cytb gene of t. urticae that was identified in several bifenazate resistant populations2227284546 .
previous studies showed that mutations on the g137 site in saccharomyces cerevisiae ( equivalent to g126 in t. urticae ) contributed to respiratory - deficiency through affecting stability of fes5253 .
however , the g126 mutation alone only confers low to moderate level of resistance to bifenazate28 .
in our results , the g126s mutation was observed in populations of granger 4 , moxee 1 & 2 , and prosser 1 , 4 & 5 , which all demonstrated low to moderate level of bifenazate resistance ( rr = 8.37 - 23.02 or mortalities at discriminating dose ranged from 90 % to 100 %) ( table 3 ) , suggesting the resistance phenotypes of these samples are consistent with their genotypes .
other mutations or mutation combinations on cytb gene such as p262t , g126s with i136t / s141f that are responsible for high bifenazate resistance with rr > 27782728 were not detected in any of our samples .
bifenthrin , a pyrethroid , has been introduced for t. urticae control in hopyards since it was registered in 199351 .
because of their safety , longevity of residual activity and low cost , pyrethroids are extensively used for pest control , with about a 20 % insecticide market share23 .
unfortunately , ubiquitous resistance to pyrethroids had been broadly reported in various insect populations1920343654 .
in t. urticae , two mutations , f1538i in domain iiis6 and a1215d within the intracellular inter linker connecting domains ii and iii were linked with high bifenthrin resistance in a greek population29 .
the function of the f1538i mutation in pyrethroid resistance has been confirmed345556 while the function of a1215d is still unknown .
another substitution , l1024v in domain iis6 was reported to play an important role in the fenpropathrin resistance of t. urticae from korea30 .
pyrethroids are not used very often in the hopyards in pnw since they are linked with subsequent t. urticae outbreaks .
therefore we omitted the toxicity evaluation of field collected t. urticae samples .
however , based on our record of acaricide sprays in hopyards , bifenthrin is still used in august as the hops near harvest8 ( fig. 1 ) .
our dna diagnostic results demonstrated that a mutation in the vgsc gene ( f1538i ) was observed in 66.7 % t. urticae populations ( fig. 4b ) .
particularly , f1538i was fixed in four samples collected from grandview and prosser 4 & 5 , three of which were collected in late august or september ( table 4 ) .
additionally , esterase - mediated metabolic detoxification had also been proposed to confer resistance to pyrethroids in t. urticae575859 .
this result suggests that developing of pyrethroid resistance in hopyards should be of concern .
in summary , t. urticae populations in hopyards exhibit a low to moderate level of acaricide resistance .
the mechanisms of acaricide resistance in t. urticae are likely mediated by a number of different pathways : not only target site insensitivities but also enhanced metabolic detoxification .
it is a common phenomenon that multiple genes or mechanisms confer resistance simultaneously to a certain pesticide18206061626364 .
therefore , we plan a genome - wide investigation to identify a more complete set of candidate resistance genes from t. urticae populations of hopyards .
our data also suggests that acaricide spray history , neighboring plants , and time of the season are important factors in correctly diagnosing acaricide resistance in t. urticae .
developing a baseline effective dose for commonly used acaricides and screening local t. urticae populations with resistance - associated molecular markers would be a proactive approach toward t. urticae resistance management .
our study reveals a unique phenotypic and genotypic pattern underpinning the chemical adaptation of t. urticae in hop fields which will be of assistance in developing diagnostic tools for integrated t. urticae management .
methods mite samples the susceptible acaricide naive t. urticae strain ( ss ) was originally collected from weeds in montana in 1995 and reared under laboratory conditions without exposure to any pesticides8 .
this population was reared on 2 - week - old lima bean plants ( phaseolus lunatus l. ) at 28 +/ - 2 degreesc , 70 +/ - 5 rh and a photoperiod of 16:8 ( l : d ) h in an isolated walk - in growth chamber at the irrigated agricultural research and extension center ( iarec ) in prosser , wa. bean plants were grown from seeds ( buckeye seed supply , canton , oh ) with medium grade vermiculite ( therm - o - rock west inc. ) soaking in water in the greenhouse .
new , healthy , lima bean plants were provided for t. urticae and plants were replaced every seven days .
to prevent mite migration , the colonies were maintained in 27 - l plastic tubs filled with soapy water huffaker moats8 .
thirty - one field t. urticae populations were collected from commercial hopyards located within the yakima valley of washington state from june to september in 2013 .
there were five major locations : one sample was collected in grandview , wa ( 46degrees15'13 '' n 119degrees54'36 '' w ) , eight in granger , wa ( 46degrees20'40 '' n 120degrees11'29 '' w ) , four in mabton , wa ( 46degrees12'42 '' n 119degrees59'47 '' w ) , two in moxee , wa ( 46degrees33'23 '' n 120degrees23'14 '' w ) , and 16 in prosser , wa ( 46degrees12'25 '' n 119degrees45'56 '' w ) ( fig. 2 ; tables 2 , 3 , 4 , , , , , , , ) .
the samples collected from the same location at different times were treated as different populations .
mite - infested hop leaves were stored in a plastic bag and transported to the lab in a cooling box within a few hours of collection .
spider mites were identified under a dissecting scope according to morphological characteristics13 .
approximately 50 - 100 adults were stored in 95 % ethanol for genomic dna extraction .
about 300 adult t. urticae from each of five major locations listed in table 4 were also stored in rnalater ( r ) ( sigma - aldrich , saint louis , mo ) for rna extraction .
remaining mites were used for bioassays directly .
because three samples had a low number of mites ( table 4 ) , we reared them on lima bean plants in an isolated walk - in growth chamber for one month to increase population size before sampling them for dna extraction and bioassays .
bioassays and data analysis leaf disc bioassays were used to estimate the lc50 ( lethal concentration required to kill 50 % of the individuals in a population ) of abamectin and bifenazate for lab susceptible and field spider mite populations .
the method followed that of knight et al.65 .
briefly , ten female adult spider mites were placed on the back of a bean leaf disc ( 2 cm diameter ) with a fine brush .
two leaf discs were arranged on water - saturated cotton ( 4 cm x 4 cm ) in a single petri dish ( 9 cm diameter , 1.5 cm height ; alkali scientific , pompano beach , fl ) .
the water - saturated cotton was pushed up against the perimeter of the leaf disc to prevent mites from walking off the disc65 .
two commercially formulated acaricides for leaf disc bioassay are epi - mek ( r ) 0.15 ec ( 2 % a.i. abamectin , syngenta crop protection ) and acramite ( r ) 50ws ( 50 % a.i. bifenazate , chemtura agro solutions ) .
the recommended field concentrations for these two acaricides are 23 mg a.i. / l and 899 mg a.i. / l , respectively .
the field rate solutions were prepared in the lab using commercial formulated acaricides and distilled water .
these solutions were serially diluted in distilled water for 4 - 7 concentrations ranged from 0.1 - 67 mg a.i. / l and 0.44 - 889 mg a.i. / l for epi - mek ( r ) and acramite ( r ) , respectively .
the sticky tape method was used to estimate the lc50 to bifenthrin for the lab susceptible strain because pyrethroids are shown to have repellent effects on mites66 .
in this method , ten female adult spider mites were placed dorsal side down on a strip of double - sided sticky scotch ( r ) tape ( 3cm x 1.2 cm ) stuck on a glass slide ( 7.5 cm x 2.5 cm ) .
the commercially formulated bifenthrin was bifenture ( r ) ec , a pyrethroid provided by united phosphorus ( 25.1 % a.i. bifenthrin ) .
these bifenthrin solutions were serially diluted in distilled water for 4 - 7 concentrations ranged from 6 - 120 mg a.i. / l. leaf discs or glass slides were treated topically with 2 ml of acaricide solutions with a potter spray tower ( burkard manufacturing , richmansworth , herts , uk ) 67 .
the tower was calibrated to deliver 1.1 kg / cm2 which allowed 2.0 +/ - 0.1 mg / cm2 spray fluid .
each bioassay consisted of 4 - 7 acaricide concentrations with 4 - 6 replicates for each concentration .
the spider mites exposed to distilled water in the potter spray tower were used as the non - treated control .
the treated leaf discs or glass slides were maintained at 25 +/ - 2 degreesc and a photoperiod of 16:8 ( l : d ) h after the initiation of the bioassay .
mortality was evaluated after 24 h. mortality was assessed by gently touching each individual spider mite with a fine camel hair paint brush under a dissecting stereomicroscope .
the individuals with no response were counted as dead .
the few moribund individuals that were not able to maintain balance and show uncoordinated twitching were also recorded as dead .
the slope , intercept , and lc50 ( corrected against the untreated control ) were evaluated with abbott 's formula68 calculated by log - dose probit analysis ( polo probit 2014 ) .
the statistical analysis of lc50 values was based on non - overlapping 95 % ci. resistance ratios ( rrs ) were calculated through dividing lc50 values of field samples by the lc50 value of the lab susceptible population .
resistance - associated amino acid substitution screening genomic dna was extracted using a dneasy blood & tissue kit ( qiagen ) from 10 adult mites for each population .
the dna was stored at - 20 degreesc till use .
the genomic dna was used as a template for pcr performed in a peltier - effect thermal cycler ( mj research , inc. , canada ) .
primers for pcr amplification of regions with resistance - associated point mutations are listed in table s1 .
pcr was performed using phusion high - fidelity dna polymerase ( thermo scientific , pittsburgh , pa ) under the following cycling parameters : 95 degreesc for 3 min 50 s , 35 cycles of 94 degreesc for 35 s , 55 degreesc for 35 s , and 72 degreesc for 3 min , with final extension for 10 min at 72 degreesc .
pcr products were purified using dna clean & concentrator ( zymo research , irvine , ca ) following the manufacturer 's protocol .
the purified dna from each individual was directly sequenced using primers described above ( table s1 ) for pcr amplification .
each individual pcr product was sequenced using abi bigdye terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) on an abi 3730 at the center for reproductive biology molecular biology and genomics core facility at washington state university .
the obtained sequences were analyzed with bioedit 7.0.1 software ( ibis biosciences , carlsbad , ca ) .
the occurrence of mutations was evaluated according to the inspection of sequencing chromatographs , as containing one or both alleles .
each sample was sequenced three times with independently prepared genomic dnas .
rna extraction , cdna synthesis and qrt - pcr total rna from 100 spider mites per population was extracted using trizol reagent ( invitrogen ) following manufacturer 's protocol .
the quality of total rna was checked by gel electrophoresis and spectrometry analyses .
the total rna was treated with dnase i ( ambion inc. , austin , tx ) to remove contaminating dna .
dnase i treated total rna was used as a template for cdna synthesizes by m - mlv reverse transcriptase ( promega , madison , wi ) .
qrt - pcr was performed using a cfx96 ( tm ) real - time pcr detection system ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca ) .
each qrt - pcr reaction ( 10 mul final volume ) contained 5 mul iq ( tm ) sybr green supermix ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca ) , 1.0 mul of cdna , 3.6 mul ddh2o , and 0.4 mul forward and reverse gene specific primers ( table s4 , stock 10 mum ) .
an initial incubation of 95 degreesc for 3 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 degreesc for 10 s , 55 degreesc for 60 s settings were used .
the qrt - pcr for each sample was conducted with two technique replicates and three biological replicates .
the no - template control and internal controls were included in each plate .
actin and rp49 were used as reference genes for internal controls49 .
relative expression levels for target genes , in relation to two reference genes , actin and rp49 were calculated by the 2 - incrementincrementct method69 .
both the pcr efficiency and r2 ( correlation coefficient ) value were taken into consideration in estimating relative quantities .
pcr efficiency between 95 % and 105 % and r2 value > 0.99 for each gene were considered as qualified for further analysis .

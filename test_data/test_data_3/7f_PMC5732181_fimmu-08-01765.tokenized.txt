b7 - h4 , one of the co - stimulatory molecules of the b7 family , has been shown to play an important role in negatively regulating the adaptive immune response by inhibiting the proliferation , activation , and cytokine production of t cells .
in this study , we investigate the role of b7 - h4 in development of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) .
we investigated a murine model of sle using transfer of bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( bmdcs ) that were incubated with activated syngeneic lymphocyte - derived dna .
the recipient mouse produced anti - ds - dna antibodies as well as displayed splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy as shown by significantly increased weights , and the kidneys showed lupus - like pathological changes include urine protein and glomerulonephritis with hyperplasia in glomeruli and increased mesangial cells and vasculitis with perivascular cell infiltration , glomerular deposition of igg and complement c3 .
we showed that b7 - h4 deficiency in bmdcs could cause greater production of anti - ds - dna antibodies in transferred mice , and the lymph tissue swelling and the kidney lesions were also exacerbated with b7 - h4 deficiency .
treatment with a b7 - h4 antagonist antibody also aggravated the lupus model .
conversely , b7 - h4 ig alleviated the lupus manifestations .
therefore , we conclude that b7 - h4 is a negative check point for the development of sle in this murine model .
these results suggest that this approach may have a clinical potential in treating human sle .
b7 - h4 dendritic cell autoimmunity systemic lupus erythematosus cd4 + t - cell introduction systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that mainly affects women in their childbearing years ( 1 ) .
it is characterized by increased production of autoantibodies against nuclear and / or cytoplasmic antigens , immune complex deposition in the microvasculature of various organs , complement activation and integration , leukocyte infiltration in multiple organs , and various types of tissue damage ( 2 - 4 ) .
immune complex accumulation in the kidney triggers a series of events that result in kidney inflammation and injury , and lupus nephritis is one of the most severe disease complications .
approximately 50 - 80 % of lupus patients suffer from lupus nephritis and it is associated with sle mortality ( 5 - 7 ) .
the etiology of sle is not well understood , but it links to genetic susceptibility , hormonal modulation , and environmental factors and the guts microbe associated with diets ( 8 ) , as well as to the most important immune disorders ( 9 ) .
both b and t lymphocytes participate in lupus pathogenesis ( 10 - 12 ) .
available treatments for sle are generally effective in many patients , but it remains a disease without a cure and the treatments have significant side effects ( 13 - 17 ) .
biological and immunotherapies for sle , such as those targeting b cells ( 18 ) , regulatory t cells ( 19 , 20 ) , and cytokines are available and others are in development .
the strain of c57bl / 6 ( b6 ) mice bearing the homozygous fas - lpr / lpr mutation ( b6 - lpr / lpr ) is an extensively studied murine model for sle , in which mutation of the fas apoptotic gene leads to a spontaneous autoimmune disorder that displayed similar with human sle syndrome ( 21 - 23 ) .
studies in this mouse strain recapitulate many aspects of human sle such as anti - chromatin , anti - dna , and anti - igg serum autoantibodies as well as a polyclonal increase in total immunoglobulins ( 24 ) .
disease severity in lpr mice is highly dependent on genetic background .
for example , mrl - lpr / lpr mice produce high levels of igg autoantibodies to dna and develop a severe glomerulonephritis due to deposition of immune complexes , while b6 - lpr / lpr mice produce low levels of autoantibodies with much milder immunopathology than mrl - lpr / lpr mice ( 21 , 25 ) .
while this lupus murine strain displayed genetic mutation thus have certain differences with human sle , xiong and his colleagues have developed a model in which subcutaneous immunized syngeneic activated lymphocyte - derived dna ( ald - dna ) to the syngeneic balb / c mice could function as an autoantigen to induce a sle syndrome , ald - dna is a kind of pathologic dna produced from con - a - induced apoptotic lymphocytes .
it could be recognized by the antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) and then activates the immune system , while the uald - dna ( unactivated lymphocyte - derived dna ) gained from the normal lymphocytes is unable to activate immune system and induce the sle syndrome ( 26 - 28 ) .
this lupus model can be induced in any strain of mice without genetic manipulation .
however , they have subcutaneously immunized mice with ald - dna combined with adjuvant , raising a concern that the cell type responsible for ald - dna effects is not defined .
it has been well known that co - stimulatory pathways affect the development and progression of autoimmunity .
the b7 family , one of most the important co - stimulatory molecular families , consists of many members that display different functions in the immune system ( 29 ) .
previous studies have found that the b7 - h1 / pd - 1 molecular pathway plays a critical role in negatively regulating mog - induced eae ( 30 ) and ctla - 4ig controlled murine lupus nephritis ( 31 ) .
b7 - h4 ( b7s1 ) is another member of the b7 family , which was discovered in a human expressed sequence tagged database ( 32 ) .
the mrna encoding b7 - h4 is widely expressed in human and murine peripheral tissues , including kidney , liver , lung , spleen , thymus , and placenta ( 32 , 33 ). by contrast , the expression of b7 - h4 cell surface protein is limited , and it is not detectable in most human and murine tissues , except in normal human epithelial cells of the female genital tract , kidney , lung , and pancreas ( 34 ) .
moreover , b7 - h4 is detected widely in tumor tissues like renal cell carcinoma , lung cancer , ovarian cancer , melanoma , breast cancer , gastric cancer , pancreatic cancer , and liver cancer ( 35 - 42 ) .
b7 - h4 expression can be induced by il - 6 and il - 10 on monocytes , macrophages , and myeloid dendritic cells ( dcs ) , while gm - csf and il - 4 can decrease b7 - h4 expression by these cells ( 38 , 43 , 44 ) .
the receptor for b7 - h4 is yet unknown .
b - and t - lymphocyte attenuator was initially thought to be the receptor for b7 - h4 ( 36 ) , but further studies showed that this is not correct ( 45 - 47 ) .
the role of b7 - h4 in the inhibition of immune responses has been shown in various in vitro systems ( 32 , 33 , 48 , 49 ) , and the suppressive function of b7 - h4 in vivo is also well - studied ( 38 , 50 - 52 ) .
blockade of b7 - h4 by a specific monoclonal antibody was shown to promote t cell responses in the presence of antigen stimulation in vivo ( 53 ) , supporting a role for endogenous b7 - h4 in suppression of the t cell response .
however , a subsequent study using b7 - h4 knockout ( b7 - h4 - ko ) mice revealed that b7 - h4 is not a general inhibitor for t cell responses .
b7 - h4 - deficient mice in a balb / c background mounted slightly enhanced t - helper type 1t cell responses and displayed mildly lowered parasite burdens upon leishmania infection compared to wild - type mice , suggesting a b7 - h4 has an inhibitory , albeit mild , effect on th1 responses ( 54 ) .
others have also reported that the soluble b7 - h4 in serum of lupus nephritis patients was strongly associated with serum creatinine levels ( 55 ) , suggesting a possible correction between sle and b7 - h4 signal pathway .
on a c57bl / 6 genetic background , b7 - h4 - ko mice did not show any signs of autoimmunity or disruption of immune cell homeostasis .
b7 - h4 - ko mice display normal numbers and ratios of t cells , b cells , nk cells , and nkt cells and macrophages in flow cytometry analysis .
in addition to t cells , b7 - h4 has been shown to suppress proliferation of neutrophil progenitors , which play a profound role in controlling infection by listeria monocytogenes ( 56 ) .
upregulation of b7 - h4 on apcs by il - 10 secreted by tregs has been proposed as a potential inhibitory mechanism of regulatory t cells ( 44 ) .
b7 - h4 ig also can alleviate the disease of cia ( 53 ) and moderate mog ( 35 - 55 )/ cfa - induced eae in c57bl / 6 mice ( 57 ) .
however , the role of b7 - h4 in sle has not been thoroughly investigated .
in this study , we raised a new method of inducing the mice sle model , by transferring bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( bmdcs ) that incubated with ald - dna to mice through tail vein , and using this model explored the potential role of b7 - h4 in sle disease progression by blocking or increasing b7 - h4 expression .
the results demonstrate that the deficiency of b7 - h4 in dcs in murine sle exacerbated the disease and further , that the exacerbation is dependent on cd4 + t cells .
conversely , increasing b7 - h4 in the lupus mice model ameliorated the disease .
these findings imply that targeting b7 - h4 could be a novel strategy for the treatment of patients with sle and other autoimmune diseases .

results bmdcs incubated with ald - dna can induce an sle syndrome in mice xiong and his colleagues had previously demonstrated that subcutaneous immunization of mice with activated syngeneic lymphocyte - derived dna ( ald - dna ) could successfully induce murine sle syndromes manifested by high levels of anti - ds - dna antibody ( 26 , 28 , 59 ) .
we confirmed that after subcutaneous immunization with ald - dna ( figure s1a in supplementary material ) , the mice displayed high levels of anti - dsdna antibodies in the 2 weeks after immunization , and the kidney showed glomerulonephritis at 20 weeks after immunization ( figure s1b in supplementary material ) .
as we know that dcs are professional apc and the dcs expressing tlrs richly , for which is mainly recognized pathologic dnas and presenting to immune system ( 60 ) .
there are many lines of evidence to indicate that dcs play a critical role in the development of sle ( 61 - 71 ) .
to confirm the hypothesis that the ald - dna induced sle syndrome was mediated by dcs , bmdcs incubated with ald - dna ( bmdcs - ald - dna ) were transferred to normal female c57bl / 6 ( b6 ) mice .
the transferred bmdcs - ald - dna successfully induced the sle - like syndrome in these transferred mice ( ald - dna lupus model ) .
the serum levels of anti - ds - dna abs were higher in mice that received bmdcs - ald - dna than in mice receiving ald - dna subcutaneous immunization which is lupus model positive control , while the mice that received pbs or bmdcs alone were unable to generate autoantibodies ( figure 1a ) .
on week 6 after the bmdcs - ald - dna transfer , the lupus mice appeared urine protein ( figure 1b ) .
interestingly , we found the ald - dna directly transferred to the mice systemic vascular circulation through tail vein could not induce anti - dsdna antibody production ( figure s1c in supplementary material ) .
this might be due to the fact that ald - dna is a big molecular substance that caused immunotolerance and soon be metabolized .
the bmdcs - uald - dna , a dna derived from bmdcs that had been incubated with unactivated lymphocytes , was unable to induce the anti - dsdna antibody after transfer , being consistent with previous report that normal dna was unable to induce mice sle syndrome ( figure s1d in supplementary material ) ( 26 - 28 ) .
moreover , the macrophage cells ( p388d1 ) incubated with ald - dna and transferred to isogenic mice failed to induce autoantibody production like bmdcs do ( figure s1e in supplementary material ) .
we found that after the bmdcs were incubated with ald - dna , the bmdcs displayed analogous changes in the cells when incubated with lps or tlr9 ligand cpg ( figure s1f in supplementary material ) .
these data showed that dcs are able to combine ald - dna and they together induced autoantibodies in mice .
the mice that received bmdcs - ald - dna developed splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy as shown by significantly increased weights compared to the control group on week 20 after the bmdcs - ald - dna transferred ( figure 1c ) , and the total numbers of splenocytes and total t or b cells and nk cells showed differences in the bmdcs - ald - dna transferred mice compared to control mice ( figure s1g in supplementary material ) .
moreover , the bmdcs - ald - dna induced mice displayed glomerulonephritis with hyperplasia in glomeruli and increased mesangial cells compared with control mice ( figure 1d ) , the kidney from the model mice also appeared vasculitis with perivascular cell infiltration , glomerular deposition of igg ( figure 1e ) , and complement c3 ( figure 1f ). by contrast , control group mice had no kidney pathology .
in addition , the lupus - like syndrome is dose dependent with bmdcs - ald - dna transferred to mice demonstrated by sera anti - ds dna abs levels and the size changes of spleens and lymph nodes ( figures s1h,i in supplementary material ) .
above results demonstrate that ald - dna could induced the murine sle syndrome through bmdcs , and the severity of lupus is positively correlated with the numbers of bmdcs - ald - dna transferred .

b7 - h4 deficient in dcs exacerbated the bmdcs - ald - dna lupus model depends on cd4 + t cells the bmdcs - ald - dna lupus model provides an ideal tool to study the effect of co - stimulatory molecules expressed on dcs and receptors on t cells in lupus .
to test the hypothesis that b7 - h4 plays a negative role in lupus pathogenesis and development , we transferred bmdcs isolated from b7 - h4 - ko or wild - type mice into normal recipient mice .
we observed that the levels of anti - ds - dna antibodies were higher in mice receiving b7 - h4 - ko bmdcs - ald - dna than in mice that received wide - type normal bmdcs - ald - dna ( figure 2a ) .
nonetheless , the b7 - h4 - ko bmdcs free of ald - dna transferred to mice failed to induce anti - dsdna antibody ( figure s2a in supplementary material ) .

the mice were sacrificed on week 20 after the wt or the b7 - h4 - ko bmdcs - ald - dna transferred to get the spleens and the kidneys .
( f ) total igg against ds - dna in sera on week 4 of the lupus mice that depleted the cd4 + t cells with gk1.5 in advance before transferred bmdcs , the gk1.5 antibody was given to lupus mice 2 weeks before the bmdcs transferred till to week 4 post the bmdcs transferred .

scale bar : 100 microm .
accordingly , b7 - h4 - ko - bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus mice displayed more splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy ( figure 2b ) , as well as kidney lesions with the deposition of immunoglobulin and complement c3 ( figures 2c - e ) .
it has been suggested that cd4 + t cells play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of lupus ( 72 - 76 ) .
xiong 's studies also verified that the production of anti - ds - dna abs in the ald - dna lupus model was dependent on cd4 + t cells ( 77 ) .
we examined the components of the inflammatory cells in the lupus mice and found that the percentages of cd4 + t , il - 2 + , il - 17 + cells in peripheral blood were significantly higher in b7 - h4 - ko bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus mice than that in wt bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus mice ( figure s2b in supplementary material ) .
conversely , the anti - inflammation cells cd4 + foxp3 + treg cells ( figure s2c in supplementary material ) were significantly lower in b7 - h4 - ko bmdcs - induced lupus mice compared to control mice ; thus , these results show that the lack of b7 - h4 on dcs has changed the balance between t effector and treg cells in this model .
given that pro - inflammatory cytokines are crucial in lupus pathogenesis ( 78 , 79 ) , we also measured the cytokine production level in vitro that wt or b7 - h4 - ko bmdcs incubated with ald - dna and then co - cultured with wild - type normal cd4 + cells supernatants used a cytokine test kit named cba ( bd ) .
we observed that co - cultured cells displayed higher levels of secreted cytokines ( il - 2 , il - 17 , il - 6 , tnf - alpha , and ifn - gamma ) in b7 - h4 - ko bmdcs compared with wt bmdcs ( figure s2d in supplementary material ) , although the co - cultured cell proliferation showed no differences between two groups ( figure s2e in supplementary material ) .
the cytokines in the sera from the wt bmdcs - ald - dna or b7 - h4 - ko bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus mice also showed the comparable differences ( figure s2f in supplementary material ) .
since exacerbation of the lupus syndrome in the b7 - h4 - deficient bmdcs - ald - dna induced model can be abolished by cd4 + t cell depletion in vivo ( figure 2f ) , thus this suggests that the b7 - h4 signal mainly affects cd4 + t cell function to affect lupus disease manifestations .
these data also implicate endogenous b7 - h4 as a checkpoint molecule in suppressing ald - dna - induced lupus model .
b7 - h4 antagonist antibody treatment increased disease manifestations in the bmdcs - ald - dna lupus model to further validate the role of b7 - h4 in lupus pathogenesis , we then tested effects of b7 - h4 antibody named 6h3 on lupus development and progression in this induced lupus model .
6h3 bound to b7 - h4 transfected on 293t cells ( figure s3a in supplementary material ) .
we revealed that 6h3 infusion significantly increased the levels of the anti - ds - dna antibodies in mice receiving bmdcs - ald - dna ( figure 3a ) .
the spleen and lymph nodes from the lupus mice with 6h3 treatment were also larger than those of the groups treated with control mig ( figure 3b ) .
the total numbers of splenocytes show parallel differences , as well as the t , b , and dc subsets in the spleens were shown differences between the 6h3 treatment and control group ( figure s3b in supplementary material ) .
the cd4 + t cells and il - 2 + cd4 + t cells ratio were significantly higher in the 6h3 group while the cd4 + foxp3 + t cells decreased in the 6h3 treatment compared to control group ( figure s3c in supplementary material ) .
the kidney lesion ( figure 3c ) as well as the deposition of immunoglobulin ( figure 3d ; figure s3d in supplementary material ) and complement c3 ( figure 3e ) were more evident in 6h3 treatment group than in mig treatment group .
the proliferation of lupus mice splenocytes was significantly higher in 6h3 treatment than in control mig treatment mice in vitro ( figure 3f ) .
the effect of 6h3 in the bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus model was diminished by cd4 + t cell depletion ( figure 3g ) , in accordance with b7 - h4 - ko - bmdcs - ald - dna - induced sever lupus mice syndrome dependent on cd4 + t cells ( figure 2f ) .
these data provide further evidence that b7 - h4 deficiency could reinforce the bmdcs - ald - dna lupus model and the exacerbation dependent on cd4 + t cells .

the mice were sacrificed to get the spleens , lymph nodes , and kidneys on week 20 after the bmdcs transferred .

suppression of bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus model by b7 - h4ig while our data show that b7 - h4 deficiency or b7 - h4 antagonist antibody 6h3 could aggravate the bmdcs - ald - dna lupus model , a potential approach to inhibit the progression of lupus is by regulating b7 - h4 expression in the form of an agonist of the unknown receptor ( 53 ) .
liu and his colleagues reported that hydrodynamic tail vein injection of targeted dna plasmid in the mouse resulted in specific plasmid protein overexpression ( 80 ) .
we adopted this method and hydrodynamically injected b7 - h4igv plasmid via tail vein to the mouse ( c57bl / 6 or balb / c background ) and tested the b7 - h4 confusion protein expression in serum .
as shown in figure s4a in supplementary material , the b7 - h4ig was expressed in a concentration peak 24 h post injection and disappeared at around 120 h post injection .
the bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus model mice were injected with b7 - h4igv plasmid or control flag plasmid at 2 days and 5 days after bmdcs - ald - dna transfers .
unlike the control flag group , b7 - h4ig treatment markedly suppressed the production of total igg of anti - ds - dna antibodies , and the suppression effect appeared on normal wild - type c57bl / 6 mice ( figure 4a ) or balb / c mice ( figure s4b in supplementary material ) or b7 - h4 - ko mice ( figure s4c in supplementary material ) .
moreover , we revealed that b7 - h4 ig treatment also neutralized the differences in the autoantibody levels in the b7 - h4ko bmdcs - ald - dna and bmdcs - ald - dna induced autoantibodies ( figure s4d in supplementary material ) .
kryczek and his colleagues have previously found that b7 - h4 expression could be increased on dcs by rmil - 10 ( 44 ) .
as shown in figure s4e in supplementary material , b7 - h4 mrna expression level was relatively increased in bmdcs as rmil - 10 was present .
the bmdcs - ald - dna that treated with rmil - 10 induced lower anti - ds - dna antibody level compared with the bmdcs - ald - dna group without rmil - 10 treatment ( figure 4b ) .
meanwhile , the b7 - h4ig treated lupus mice displayed relatively mild splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy compared to mice treated with control flag ig ( figure 4c ) .
the pro - inflammatory cell infiltrate tended to be lower in b7 - h4ig mice compared with control flag ig mice , while the regulatory cd4 + foxp3 + t cells were increased in the mice treated with b7 - h4ig ( figure s4f in supplementary material ) .
in vitro , splenocytes proliferation from ald - dna stimulation of the bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus model was lower in b7 - h4ig present compared with the control flag present ( figure 4d ) .
the renal lesion in these mice was milder with b7 - h4ig treatment compared with control flag group ( figures 4e - g ) .
thus , our data have demonstrated that b7 - h4ig treatment alleviates the severity of bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus - like syndrome , and it might potentially be clinically valuable in treating sle .

b7 - h4 - deficient c57bl / 6 - lpr / lpr mice developed exacerbation of lupus we also used the b6 - lpr / lpr strain that is considered as a commonly used mouse model for sle to validate the effect of b7 - h4 on lupus disease .
the b6 - lpr mice were back crossed with b7 - h4 - ko mice to produce b7 - h4 - ko lpr mice .
consistently , increased anti - ds - dna ab production was observed in h4 - lpr mice ( b7 - h4 - ko lpr mice ) compared to b6 - lpr mice ( figure 5a ) .
moreover , the autoantibodies appeared significantly earlier in h4 - lpr mice than in control mice .
the h4 - lpr mice developed greater splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy with significantly increased organ weights compared to b6 - lpr mice ( figure 5b ) .
accordingly , the total number of splenocytes from h4 - lpr mice was much more than from b6 - lpr ( figure s5a in supplementary material ) .
increased inflammation cell subsets in h4 - lpr mice were also observed compared to b6 - lpr mice , the percentages of cd3 + cd4 + t cells , cd3 + cd4 - cd8 - t cells , cd19 + b cells , nk1.1 + nk cells , and cd3 + nk1.1 + nkt cells in peripheral blood were significantly higher in h4 - lpr mice than in b6 - lpr mice ( figure s5b in supplementary material ) , similarly , the follicular helper cell ( tfh ) showed significantly greater in the h4 - lpr mice spleen compared to control ( figure s5c in supplementary material ) .
conversely , the cd4 + foxp3 + treg cells in the peripheral blood were significantly lower in h4 - lpr mice than in b6 - lpr mice ( figure s5c in supplementary material ) .
the h4 - lpr mice also developed more severe glomerulonephritis with hyperplasia in glomeruli and increased mesangial cells than b6 - lpr mice at ages of 30 weeks ( figure 5c ) .
furthermore , the h4 - lpr mice displayed vasculitis with perivascular cell infiltration , glomerular deposition of igg ( figure 5d ) and complement c3 ( figure 5e ) , by contrast , b6 - lpr mice had minor kidney lesion pathology .
in addition , the b7 - h4 antibody , 6h3 treatment increased the anti - ds - dna antibodies b6 - lpr mice ( figure 5f ) , while this antibody did not change the anti - ds - dna ab levels in normal c57bl / 6 mice ( figure s5d in supplementary material ) .
these data provide evidence that the b7 - h4 signal also affects disease development in b6 - lpr mice , it is furthermore indicated the role of b7 - h4 in sle .

discussion previous studies have demonstrated that activated syngeneic lymphocyte - derived dna ( ald - dna ) , a kind of pathologic nucleic acid that is hypomethylation separate from apoptotic lymphocytes , subcutaneous immunization can cause a lupus - like syndrome including autoantibodies and characteristic kidney lesions ( 26 , 59 , 81 ) .
given that the professional apc , dcs play critical roles in the development of lupus ( 61 - 66 ) , we hypothesized that ald - dna induced sle syndrome was primarily mediated by dcs .
to test this hypothesis , we transferred bmdcs incubated with ald - dna ( bmdcs - ald - dna ) to c57bl / 6 ( b6 ) mice and found that high titers of anti - ds - dna antibodies developed , and the mice displayed the splenomegaly and kidney lesion that is similarly to lupus syndromes .
interestingly , the macrophage cannot induce lupus - like syndrome in the same manner , it is likely that tlr9 signal plays an important role in the ald - dna induced the activation of immune system and lupus model ( 59 ) , since previous study has revealed that tlr9 is not expressed on macrophage ( 60 ) .
thus , we have improved the induced lupus model that could be useful in studying the pathogenesis of lupus .
the data presented in this paper are also the first demonstration of the role of b7 - h4 in regulating the development of murine ald - dna induced sle .
using different strategies including b7 - h4 - deficient dcs , b7 - h4 antagonist antibody 6h3 or b7 - h4 confusion protein , we have demonstrated that b7 - h4 expressed on dc could bind to its unidentified receptor on t cells to deliver a negative signal to suppress immune responses .
as b7 - h4 - deficient mice do not show autoimmunity ( 56 ) , b7 - h4 signal deficiency markedly accelerates the development of lupus in a dc - induced lupus model , suggesting that the b7 - h4 signal is crucial in the pathogenic condition and alleviates the bmdcs - ald - dna induced lupus progression .
although the receptor for b7 - h4 is not yet identified , cd4 + t cells are crucial since the effect of b7 - h4 signal on lupus development is diminished by cd4 + cell deletion .
we developed the idea that b7 - h4 may work through delivering a sustained negative signal to its putative receptor on cd4 + t cells .
we also used the b6 - lpr mice to further validate that the effect on b7 - h4 on ald - dna induced lupus can be repeated in another commonly used model .
similarly , the blockade of the b7 - h4 signaling pathway exacerbated lupus diseases , further demonstrating that this pathway is a negative signal to control immune responses in lupus .
although the underlying mechanisms are not completely clear , the effect of b7 - h4 on t cell subset function is likely .
chen and his colleagues previously reported that b7 - h4 inhibits cell cycle progression from g0 to g1 in t cells upon t cell receptor engagement ( 32 ) .
thus , the delay of t cell activation and proliferation could contribute to suppressive effects on lupus symptoms .
we have observed that b7 - h4 - deficient b6 - lpr mice had significantly increased inflammation cellularity in spleen and peripheral blood , and the predominant cell types are cd3 + cd4 - cd8 - t cells that produce th1 and th17 like cytokines .
these so - called double negative t cells have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of the b6 - lpr phenotype ( 80 ) .
treg cells have been shown to suppress murine lupus - like syndromes and other autoimmune diseases ( 19 , 20 , 82 ) , and the relationship between co - stimulatory signals and treg subset development has been reported previously ( 83 ) .
our results showed that the cd4 + foxp3 + treg cells were decreased in b7 - h4 - ko dcs incubated with ald - dna - induced lupus mice and bmdcs - ald - dna mice treated with 6h3 , a b7 - h4 antibody .
additionally , treg cells were also decreased in h4 - lpr mice compared with the b6 - lpr mice .
it is likely that b7 - h4 expressed on dcs binds to unidentified receptor and then promotes the treg subset induction and function .
the lack of b7 - h4 could decrease treg cells and then contribute to the exacerbation of the lupus disease .
others have reported that the b7 - h4 ig improved the eae syndrome via il - 10 / tregs mechanisms ( 57 ) .
it warrants a further study whether the il - 10 also plays a role in b7 - h4 signal in lupus .
we also observed that the b7 - h4 pathway affects proliferation of the ald - dna induced t cells but not normal t cells ( figure s6 in supplementary material ) , so it is likely that the b7 - h4 pathway mainly affects the proliferation of t cells that have altered thresholds , particularly in an autoimmune disease condition .
taken together , our results suggest that b7 - h4 expressed on dcs plays an important role in negative regulation of autoimmunity in lupus mice through bonding the putative receptor on cd4 + t cells and influencing the regulatory t cells ( figure s7 in supplementary material ) .
targeting b7 - h4 may provide a potentially and clinically valuable approach to treating patients with sle and other autoimmune diseases .

figure s7 conclusion : there existed a cycle in lupus mice , dendritic cells ( dcs ) recognized the pathologic dna from the cell damage through the tlrs on the surface , then the dcs delivered the immuno - signals to cd4 + t cells , the cd4 + t cells then promoted the b cells to autoantibodies production or directly produced pathology and further caused cell damages and released auto - dnas on systemic circulation , thus these damages will cause the pathologic dnas releasing , and be recognized by dcs again .
b7 - h4 expressed on dcs and incorporation with his unknown receptor on cd4 + t cells , and then inhibited the cd4 + t cells function to alleviate systemic lupus erythematosus .

background in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae , as in every eukaryotic organism , the mrna 5 ' - untranslated region ( utr ) is important for translation initiation .
however , the patterns and mechanisms that determine the efficiency with which ribozomes bind mrna , the elongation of ribosomes through the 5 ' - utr , and the formation of a stable translation initiation complex are not clear .
genes that are highly expressed in s. cerevisiae seem to prefer a 5 ' - utr rich in adenine and poor in guanine , particularly in the kozak sequence , which occupies roughly the first six nucleotides upstream of the start codon .
results we measured the fluorescence produced by 58 synthetic versions of the s. cerevisiae minimal cyc1 promoter ( pcyc1min ) , each containing a different 5 ' - utr .
first , we replaced with adenine the last 15 nucleotides of the original pcyc1min 5 ' - utr - - a theoretically optimal configuration for high gene expression .
next , we carried out single and multiple point mutations on it. protein synthesis was highly affected by both single and multiple point mutations upstream of the kozak sequence .
rnafold simulations revealed that significant changes in the mrna secondary structures occur by mutating more than three adenines into guanines between positions - 15 and - 9 .
furthermore , the effect of point mutations turned out to be strongly context - dependent , indicating that adenines placed just upstream of the start codon do not per se guarantee an increase in gene expression , as previously suggested .
conclusions new synthetic eukaryotic promoters , which differ for their translation initiation rate , can be built by acting on the nucleotides upstream of the kozak sequence .
translation efficiency could , potentially , be influenced by another portion of the 5 ' - utr further upstream of the start codon .
a deeper understanding of the role of the 5 ' - utr in gene expression would improve criteria for choosing and using promoters inside yeast synthetic gene circuits .

these basic components are dna sequences associated with precise transcription or translation functions and are known as standard biological parts [ 1 ] .
bacterial parts are divided into four main groups : promoters , ribosome binding sites ( rbss ) , coding sequences ( cdss ) , and terminators .
promoters and terminators are , respectively , the start and stop signals for dna transcription into mrna .
the rbs is the entry point for the ribosomes into the mrna , i.e. the place where translation initiation takes place .
protein synthesis terminates when the ribosomes meet the stop codon at the end of the cds .
the main feature of the rbs is the shine - dalgarno sequence , located approximately 10 nucleotides upstream of the start codon .
its complementarity to a ribosomal region allows it to be recognized and bound by ribosomes .
the rbs has been widely studied and , remarkably , software has been developed to design regulated rbss with the aim of tuning gene expression [ 2 ] .
eukaryotic cells do not have a counterpart to the shine - dalgarno sequence and mature mrna is recognized by ribosomes because of the presence of the 5 ' cap .
although the mrna 5 ' untranslated region ( utr ) plays an important role in determining protein expression [ 3 - 5 ] , a eukaryotic standard biological part corresponding to it has never been defined and it is regarded simply as the end of the promoter sequence .
a feature specific to eukaryotic mrna is the kozak sequence [ 6 ] , which extends from approximately position - 6 to position + 6 , where + 1 is assigned to the adenine of the start codon ( throughout the present paper , all positions are given respective to the start codon ) .
the consensus kozak sequence varies across organisms in length and nucleotide composition ( see for instance [ 6 - 8 ]) .
however , point mutations in the kozak sequence affect transcription initiation both in higher [ 6 ] and lower [ 9 ] eukaryotes .
the consensus kozak sequence in yeast s. cerevisiae was identified by hamilton et al .
[ 8 ] , who analyzed the translation initiation site ( defined as the region between positions - 47 and + 50 ) of 99 genes and calculated the frequency at which each of the four nucleotides occupies any of these positions .
position occupancies were also calculated on the subset of highly expressed genes , a main reference point for our work in constructing synthetic 5 ' - utrs that enhance gene expression .
the portion of 5 ' - utrs made of 47 nucleotides , taken into account in [ 8 ] , was rich in adenine and poor in guanine .
the abundance of a single nucleotide ( adenine ) was explained as a means to avoid secondary structures in the leader sequence , which could prevent efficient gene expression .
however , this explanation is somewhat challenged by recent in vitro analysis showing a positive correlation between secondary structure in the s. cerevisiae 5 ' - utr and protein abundance [ 10 - 12 ] .
the optimal s. cerevisiae consensus kozak sequence ( i.e. arising from the group of highly expressed genes ) was determined as \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ \ left (\ mathrm { a }/\ mathrm { t }\ right )\ mathrm { a }\ left (\ mathrm { a }/\ mathrm { c }\ right )\ mathrm { a }\ left (\ mathrm { a }/\ mathrm { c }\ right )\ mathrm { a }\ mathbf { atg }\ mathrm { tc }\ left (\ mathrm { t }/\ mathrm { c }\ right )\ kern2.77626pt , $$\ end { document }( a / t ) a ( a / c ) a ( a / c ) aatgtc ( t / c ) , where adenine and thymine at position - 6 and adenine and cytosine at position - 4 showed the same frequency , whereas at position - 2 the frequency of adenine was higher than that of cytosine ( 50 % versus 33 %) .
interestingly , adenine was always present at position - 3 .
the triplet at positions - 2 to - 4 exhibits some analogies with the consensus kozak sequence in mammalian cells .
here , a cytosine can be found at positions - 4 and - 2 and a purine ( a or g ) is highly conserved at position - 3 .
following the analysis by hamilton and co - authors [ 8 ] , we can define those nucleotides whose frequency at a given position is > 50 % as strongly conserved .
accordingly , adenine is strongly conserved at positions - 1 , - 3 , - 5 , - 7 , and - 8. from position - 9 to - 15 , no nucleotide is strongly conserved .
in all these positions the most frequent nucleotide is adenine , apart from position - 14 where thymine prevails slightly ( 39 % thymine versus 33 % adenine ) .
at positions - 16 to - 20 adenine again becomes strongly conserved .
more upstream , short traits where adenine is strongly conserved interrupt longer regions where the frequency of no nucleotide reaches 51 % .
a different study on the effect of the 5 ' - utr on gene expression in s. cerevisiae was carried out by dvir et al .
[ 9 ] .
they generated a pool of 2041 distinct leader sequences by performing random mutations in the - 10 ...
- 1 region of the rpl8a gene ( the whole rpl8a 5 ' - utr is only 17 nucleotides long ) .
the rpl8a promoter was placed in front of a reporter protein and the influence of diverse 5 ' - utrs on gene expression was quantified by fluorescence measurements .
the data collected in that study showed that protein synthesis is highly influenced by the nucleotide at position - 3 : a purine ( principally adenine ) increases protein expression , whereas a pyrimidine lowers it. a further enhancement in gene expression arises when the purine at position - 3 is accompanied by other adenines at positions - 1 to - 4 .
moreover , an adenine at position - 1 is sufficient to increase protein expression no matter which nucleotide is present at position - 3 .
in contrast , a guanine at position - 2 and a cytosine at position - 1 have a negative impact on translation initiation .
cytosine is also moderately under - represented at position - 2 among the highly expressed rpl8a variants .
taking our cue from the works by hamilton et al .
[ 8 ] and dvir et al .
[ 9 ] , we carried out a detailed study on how synthetic 5 ' - utrs can alter gene expression in s. cerevisiae. by following an approach similar to that in [ 9 ] , we focused on a unique gene ( cyc1 ) and built 58 synthetic variants of the minimal cyc1 promoter ( pcyc1min ) via single and multiple point mutations between positions - 15 and - 1 .
the starting point of our work was , however , not the original cyc1 leader sequence but a synthetic one optimized for high gene expression , according to the results in [ 8 ] .
we fused each synthetic 5 ' - utr to the cds of a green fluorescent protein and quantified gene expression via facs experiments .
our results indicate clearly that nucleotides upstream of the kozak sequence ( positions - 9 to - 15 ) play an important role in protein synthesis .
above all , single point mutations , on an adenine background , tend to increase protein expression , whereas multiple mutations to guanine are negatively correlated to gene expression , even when followed by a kozak sequence containing only adenines .
the latter result is due to changes in the mrna secondary structure as indicated by the results of simulations with the software rnafold [ 13 , 14 ] .
our work paves the way for the characterization of eukaryotic promoters through their translational strength .
results and discussion we chose the 5 ' - utr of the well - studied s. cerevisiae cyc1 promoter [ 15 , 16 ] .
we fused pcyc1min ( starting at position - 143 ) to a yeast - enhanced green fluorescent protein ( yegfp ) [ 17 ] and the cyc1 terminator .
compared to the complete cyc1 promoter , pcyc1min contains two of the three tata boxes and no upstream activating sequences .
pcyc1min is a moderately weak promoter and , for this reason , appears to be an ideal candidate for detecting both positive and negative effects of point mutations in the leader sequence on the expression of the downstream reporter protein .
the cyc1 promoter 5 ' - utr is 71 nucleotides long .
in the following analysis , we refer to the portion of cyc1 5 ' - utr at position - 1 to - 8 as the extended kozak sequence and that at - 9 to - 15 as the upstream region .
in the extended kozak sequence adenine is strongly conserved in five positions , whereas in the upstream region no nucleotide is strongly conserved .
however , adenine is the most frequent at almost every site ( see background ) .
the extended kozak sequence the original cyc1 sequence from positions - 15 to - 1 is cacactaaattaata ( hereafter referred to as k 0 ) .
according to dvir et al .
[ 9 ] , the presence of an adenine at positions - 1 , - 3 , and - 4 , together with the absence of guanine at position - 2 , should make this leader sequence almost optimal for high expression .
however , thymine at position - 2 and cytosine at position - 13 have a frequency lower than 20 % and 10 % , respectively , among highly expressed s. cerevisiae genes [ 8 ] .
we built our first synthetic cyc1 leader sequence ( k 1 ) by placing an adenine at each position from - 1 to - 15 .
the fluorescence level associated with k 1 was 6.5 % higher than that measured with k 0 .
however , no statistically significant difference arose from the data gathered on these two leader sequences ( p - value = 0.13 ) .
we kept k 1 ( the optimized leader sequence ) as a template for our next synthetic constructs and built 57 more synthetic 5 ' - utrs by mutating single or multiple nucleotides in k 1 .
the first group of synthetic leader sequences was made by a single point mutation from position - 1 to position - 8 ( see table 1 ) .
hence , we modified the extended kozak sequence only , whereas the upstream region was kept in an optimized configuration for high gene expression with adenines at positions - 9 to - 15 .

k 0 represents the original cyc1 5 ' - utr terminal sequence the highest fluorescence was recorded for k 16 ( where a guanine substituted the adenine at position - 5 ) and the lowest by k 9 ( where a thymine replaced the adenine at position - 3 ) .
moreover , the fluorescence level of k 16 was statistically significantly different from that of k 0 and k 1 .
an enhancement in fluorescence due to a guanine at position - 5 was a surprising result because guanine is the least frequent nucleotide in yeast s. cerevisiae leader sequences .
moreover , no guanine was ever detected at this position among highly expressed genes [ 8 ] or provoked any fluorescence enhancement in the work by dvir et al .
[ 9 ] .
despite the absence of a statistically significant difference from k 1 , the only constructs other than k 16 that resulted in an increase of > 5 % on the fluorescence level of k 1 were k 3 , k 10 , and k 24 .
in particular , in k 3 , a thymine replaced an adenine at position - 1 , and in k 10 the adenine at position - 3 was mutated into a guanine .
as reported above , adenine at positions - 1 and - 3 should guarantee high gene expression .
nevertheless , on such an adenine background , less frequent nucleotides at positions - 1 or - 3 seem to be required to further enhance gene expression .
in contrast , a thymine instead of an adenine at position - 3 ( k 9 ) was the only mutation that induced a > 5 % reduction in k 1 fluorescence level .
this result is consistent with the observation in [ 9 ] that a thymine at position - 3 is abundant in poorly expressed genes ( fig. 1 a ). fig. 1 effect of point mutations in the extended kozak sequence on fluorescence expression .
fluorescence levels are plotted relative to k 1 ( a ) and k 0 ( b ) .
control corresponds to a yeast strain without the yegfp gene .
the nucleotide that replaced an adenine in k 1 and the position at which the mutation took place are given below the name of each synthetic leader sequence .
asterisks , p - value < 0.05 vs. k 1 ( a ) or k 0 ( b ) with respect to k 0 , all 25 new synthetic leader sequences contained between six and eight mutations .
apart from k 9 , all synthetic 5 ' - utrs showed a fluorescence level higher than that of k 0 , five of which were significantly higher .
these included positions - 1 , - 4 , and - 5 .
as already noted in the comparison with k 1 , an adenine just upstream of the start codon seemed to be of no particular advantage for gene expression .
here , a cytosine and a thymine ( k 2 and k 3 , respectively ) performed much better than an adenine .
however , with respect to k 0 , there were seven more point mutations upstream .
at position - 4 a thymine ( k 12 ) resulted in the highest fluorescence increment , whereas at position - 5 , both a cytosine ( k 14 ) and a guanine ( k 16 ) enhanced fluorescence to > 10 % above that of k 0 .
since k 0 has a thymine at positions - 2 , - 5 , and - 6 , each of the five synthetic 5 ' - utrs that showed statistically significant differences from k 0 were affected by a point mutation at two or more adjacent sites .
three more synthetic leader sequences ( k 10,k 17 , and k 24 ) caused a > 10 % increase in fluorescence compared to k 0 , though these differences were not significant ( p - value > 0.05 ) .
k 10 and k 17 also had double point mutations at adjacent sites ( fig. 1 b ) .
multiple mutations to guanine the analysis of our first 25 synthetic 5 ' - utr sequences gave the surprising result that a single point mutation to guanine - - which is essentially absent from the extended kozak sequence of highly expressed s. cerevisiae genes - - can enhance the fluorescence level of k 1 , a leader sequence optimized for gene expression .
moreover , five of our synthetic 5 ' - utrs unambiguously (> 9 %) increased the fluorescence level associated with pcyc1min .
according to our data , a single mutation to guanine can enhance gene expression .
however , two previous papers [ 18 , 19 ] reported that multiple guanines placed in front of a start codon would considerably reduce protein synthesis .
therefore , we assessed how multiple point mutations to guanine affected the translation efficiency of pcyc1min , to determine if they could be used to modulate gene expression .
according to [ 8 ] , among highly expressed s. cerevisiae genes , guanine is the least frequent nucleotide between positions - 1 and - 15 , with the exception of position - 7 , in which the least frequent nucleotide is cytosine .
we constructed a synthetic 5 ' - utr that reflects this sequence ( k 26 ; table 2 ) .
this shut down gene expression , as shown by the corresponding fluorescence level not being significantly different ( p - value = 0.21 ) from our negative control ( an s. cerevisiae strain that did not contain the yegfp gene ) .

k 0 is shown for comparison .
mfe , minimum free energy , computed in rnafold we tested whether multiple mutations to guanine ( cytosine at position - 7 ) would affect gene expression in a different way when they covered either the whole extended kozak sequence ( k 27 ) or the upstream region ( k 28 ) .
since mutations were made with respect to k 1 , all the non - mutated sites contained an adenine .
surprisingly , we found that the two configurations were equivalent for gene expression ( p - value > 0.40 ) and reduced k 1 fluorescence level by about half .
starting from k 27 , we replaced the guanine at positions - 1 ( k 29 ) , - 2 ( k 30 ) , and - 3 ( k 31 ) with an adenine to determine whether a single adenine at the three positions just upstream of the start codon would enhance fluorescence expression when the other sites of the extended kozak sequence were occupied either by a guanine or a cytosine .
at position - 1 an adenine showed no improvement on the fluorescence of k 27 .
interestingly , at positions - 2 and - 3 , an adenine caused a drop in gene expression to approximately 7 % of the k 1 fluorescence level .
these results demonstrate that an adenine per se cannot improve gene expression even when it occupies position - 3 or - 1 .
more generally , we can conclude that the effect on gene expression of a single point mutation in the leader sequence is strongly context - dependent .
finally , to understand better how important the upstream region is for gene expression , we progressively reduced the number of guanines from seven ( k 28 ) to one ( k 38 ) .
starting from position - 9 , we replaced a guanine with an adenine at each step and saw that the fluorescence level increased almost linearly with the number of adenines ( fig. 2 and additional file 1 ) .
the last sequence in which the fluorescence level was statistically significantly different from that of k 1 was k 36 , in which guanines were present at positions - 13 to - 15 .
a guanine alone at position - 15 or accompanied by another at position - 14 did not result in a significant difference in fluorescence level from that of k 1 .
therefore , even in the presence of an extended kozak sequence optimized for high gene expression , multiple mutations in the upstream region have evident repercussions on protein synthesis and can be used as a means of tuning protein abundance .
an explanation for this result is presented in the computational analysis section , below .
interestingly , four guanines intermixed with adenines ( k 33 ) in the upstream region reduced k 1 fluorescence to a smaller extent than four guanines in a row ( k 32 ) , providing further confirmation that the effect on gene expression of point mutations inside the 5 ' - utr is highly dependent on the nucleotidic context ( fig. 2 ; see additional file 1 for a comparison with k 0 fluorescence ). fig. 2 multiple point mutations to guanine .
the ratio between the fluorescence level of the synthetic 5 ' - utrs from k 26 to k 38 and that of k 1 are reported .
the number of adenines or guanines in the upstream region is given below the leader sequence name ( from k 27 to k 38 ) .
the subscripts - 1 , - 2 , and - 3 indicate that an adenine is present in the extended kozak sequence only at the corresponding position .
subscript i represents intermixed ( see main text ) .
asterisks , p - value < 0.05 vs. k 1 the upstream region the previous analysis confirmed that the effect on gene expression due to both single and multiple mutations within the 5 ' - utr is strongly context - dependent .
moreover , our data clearly showed that changes not only in the kozak sequence but also inside the upstream region markedly affect gene expression .
we therefore performed point mutations on k 1 between positions - 9 and - 15 ( table 3 ) to assess whether a single nucleotide different from adenine can change the translation rate when placed into the upstream region .

also reported are k 0 and k 38 , the latter initially used to study the effect of guanines in the upstream region all point mutations ( except the one in k 38 ) resulted in a fluorescence level higher than that associated with k 1 .
notably , in eight cases , the increase in fluorescence was statistically significant (> 10 % higher than k 1 fluorescence ) .
these eight mutations included four contiguous positions , from - 11 to - 14 .
none of these were taken into account in the reference work by dvir et al .
[ 9 ] .
at position - 11 , a guanine instead of an adenine ( k 47 ) enhanced fluorescence expression by > 15 % , whereas cytosine and thymine had no significant effects .
every mutation at position - 12 increased the fluorescence of k 1 .
the greatest change (> 15 %) was due to a guanine ( k 50 ) .
mutations at position - 13 also strongly enhanced k 1 fluorescence level .
two point mutations - - cytosine ( k 51 ) and guanine ( k 53 ) - - resulted in statistically significant differences in fluorescence from k 1 , whereas a thymine ( k 52 ) augmented k 1 fluorescence by about 14 % but this did not reach statistical significance .
it should be noted that among all our 58 synthetic 5 ' - utrs , k 51 had the highest fluorescence level - - almost 17 % higher than that of k 1 .
finally , two different point mutations at position - 14 led to an increase in fluorescence : a cytosine ( k 54 ) and a thymine ( k 55 ) ( fig. 3 ; see additional file 1 for a comparison with k 0 ). fig. 3 effect of point mutations in the upstream region on fluorescence relative to k 1 .
the nucleotide that replaced an adenine in k 1 and the position at which the mutation took place are given below the name of each synthetic leader sequence .
asterisks , p - value < 0.05 vs. k 1 together , the results of this last analysis of the upstream region underline another surprising result : single point mutations upstream of the kozak sequence , in particular at positions - 12 and - 13 , were those that most enhanced gene expression from a context rich in adenines .
computational analysis we carried out simulations with rnafold to investigate possible correlations between computed mrna secondary structures , together with their corresponding minimum free energies ( mfes ) , and measured fluorescence levels .
our analysis provides an explanation for the drop in fluorescence due to multiple mutations from adenine to guanine ( and cytosine ) in the - 15 ...
- 1 region .
in contrast , no plausible justification for the effects of single point mutations on translational efficiency emerged from simulations with rnafold .
as an input for rnafold , we used mrna sequences starting at the transcription start site of pcyc1min [ 16 ] and ending at the poly - a site of the cyc1 terminator [ 20 ] .
each sequence was 937 nucleotides long. from preliminary simulations , we observed that a poly - a chain with a variable length of 150 - 200 nucleotides had no significant effect on mrna folding .
all mrna secondary structures were calculated at 30 degreesc ( the temperature at which we grew s. cerevisiae cells for the facs experiments ) .
k 0 and k 1 have the same mfe : - 241.21 kcal / mol .
this is the highest - - and the most common - - within the collection of 59 sequences analyzed in this work ( see additional file 1 ) .
the mrna secondary structure corresponding to this mfe is characterized by the presence of a giant hairpin between positions - 40 and + 10 .
the hairpin loop goes from position - 31 to position + 1 and contains the whole 5 ' - utr portion we have targeted here .
the hairpin stem is made of nine base - pairs , of which only one gave a " mismatch " because of an adenine at position - 38 and + 8 ( see fig. 4 a ). fig. 4 mrna secondary structures .
a a giant hairpin is present in the mrna secondary structure corresponding to the mfe of both k 0 and k 1 .
the hairpin loop contains the - 15 ...
- 1 region .
the portion of the 5 ' - utr in our analysis is free from any pairing interactions in its wild - type configuration ( k 0 ) and in that theoretically optimized for high protein expression ( k 1 ) .
the loop of the giant hairpin is reduced in k 4 owing to the base - pairing interaction between the guanine at position - 1 and the cytosine at position - 31 .
in every mrna structure presented , a green arrow indicates position + 1 , and a red arrow indicates position - 15 .
b the disruption of the giant hairpin induces a decrease in the mfe of the mrna secondary structure .
k 26 and k 31 are associated with the lowest mfes computed in our analysis .
the two sequences contain multiple guanines in the extended kozak sequence involved in pairing interactions with the cds .
a similar pattern is also present in k 30 .
here , however , a second mini - loop around the start codon provokes an increase in mfe .
the mfe of k 26 is substantially lower than those of k 30 and k 31 because of the presence of another stem due to pairing interactions between the upstream region and the cyc1 terminator .
nevertheless , the fluorescence levels of k 30 and k 31 are only approximately 1.2 - fold higher than that of k 26 multiple mutations to guanines either in the upstream region or the extended kozak sequence originate base - pairing interactions between , at least , a portion of the - 15 ...
- 1 region and the cds ( yegfp ) or the cyc1 terminator .
as a consequence , the giant hairpin is destroyed and replaced by one or two stems that lower the mfe of the mrna secondary structure ( table 2 ) .
most of the mfe values smaller than - 241.21 kcal / mol were associated with fluorescence levels lower than that of k 1 ( fig. 5 ) .
this result is in agreement with the notion , supported also by [ 8 , 9 ] , that stable mrna secondary structures in the 5 ' - utr reduce protein expression .
however , the fluorescence levels we measured did not increase proportionally to increments in the mfe .
moreover , in two cases ( k 32 and k 36 ) rnafold predicted a giant hairpin in the mrna structure , whereas the fluorescence levels from our experiments were significantly lower than that of k 1 ( fig. 5 and additional file 1 ). fig. 5 low mfe values are associated with reduced fluorescence expression .

the corresponding mfe ( - 261.39 kcal / mol ) was the lowest within the ensemble of transcription units considered in this work .
no giant hairpin was present in the mfe mrna secondary structure as the - 15 ...
- 1 region was sequestered into two different stems .
the guanines between positions - 1 and - 6 were part of a long stem and paired with a hexamer at the beginning of the yegfp sequence ( positions + 33 to + 38 ) .
in contrast , positions - 9 to - 15 paired with a region of the cyc1 terminator , at positions + 750 to + 758 ( fig. 4 b ) .
a fluorescence level just above that of k 26 was registered for k 30 and k 31 .
both differed from k 26 for the upstream region ( made of seven adenines ) and the presence of an adenine in the extended kozak region ( at positions - 2 and - 3 , respectively ) .
similarly to k 26 , the first five nucleotides of the extended kozak region of k 30 and the first six of k 31 were sequestered into a stem with the cds .
however , differently from k 26 , the upstream regions of k 30 and k 31 were entirely free from any pairing interactions ( see fig. 4 b ) .
their mfes ( - 244.28 and - 247.26 kcal / mol , respectively ) were also significantly higher than that of k 26 .
these three sequences suggest that a condition for markedly lowering protein expression is to enclose the nucleotides at positions - 1 to - 5 in an mrna secondary structure .
moreover , not all of these nucleotides have to participate in base - pairing interactions .
indeed , a guanine at position - 1 ( k 30 ) or - 2 ( k 26 and k 31 ) is " free " and responsible for the presence of a mini - loop in the mrna structure .
however , this hypothesis is contradicted by k 29 .
the mfe of this sequence ( - 245.97 kcal / mol ) is comparable to that of k 30 and k 31 , and the corresponding mrna secondary structure is very similar to that of k 31 ( fig. 6 a ) .
nevertheless , the fluorescence level associated with k 29 was more than 6 - fold higher than that of k 31 and amounted to 45 % of that of k 1. fig. 6 mrna secondary structures .
a k 27 differs from k 29 only by a guanine instead of an adenine at position - 1 .
however , their mrna secondary structures are dissimilar .
in k 27 , the extended kozak sequence is involved in base - pairing interactions with the cyc1 terminator , whereas in k 29 the extended kozak sequence is locked into a stem with the cds .
the mfe associated with k 27 is lower than that of k 29 , but there is no difference between the fluorescence levels of the two sequences ( p - value = 0.20 ) .
b multiple guanines in the upstream region give rise to mrna structures characterized by base - pairing interactions between the 5 ' - utr and the cyc1 terminator .
k 28 and k 34 have six guanines in a stem with the cyc1 terminator , whereas k 35 has only 5 guanines in an analogous structure .
this causes an increase in mfe and consequently a higher fluorescence k 27 shared with k 29 - k 31 an upstream region made only of adenines .
however , unlike in these three sequences , the extended kozak sequence of k 27 did not contain any adenine .
the mfe of k 27 ( - 247.04 kcal / mol ) was comparable to that of k 29 - k 31 , but its corresponding mrna secondary structure had a different configuration .
indeed , all nucleotides of the extended kozak sequence ( with the exception of the cytosine at position - 7 ) were involved in base - pairing interaction not with the cds but with the cyc1 terminator ( positions + 755 to + 762 ; fig. 6 a ) .
the fluorescence level of k 27 was slightly higher than that of k 29 , i.e. almost 7 - fold greater than that of k 31 .
the five sequences considered so far ( k 26 , k 27 , k 29 - k 31 ) have in common an extended kozak region rich in guanine that was sequestered into a stem in the mfe mrna secondary structure .
in four cases , the extended kozak sequence paired ( partially ) with the cds , and in one case ( k 27 ) with the cyc1 terminator .
the mfe of k 26 was the lowest , as its upstream region was also sequestered into a stem .
the other four sequences showed very similar mfe values but rather different fluorescence levels .
the other group of sequences affected by multiple mutations with respect to k 1 had only adenines in the extended kozak sequence and a variable number of guanines in the upstream region .
k 28 , k 34 , and k 35 had , respectively , 7 , 6 , and 5 guanines in a row from position - 15 downstream .
although the mfe of k 35 was clearly higher than that of k 28 and k 34 ( table 2 ) , the three sequences gave rise to similar mrna structures where at least five guanines of the upstream region ( plus the first adenine downstream ) were locked into a stem due to base - pairing interactions with the cyc1 terminator ( see fig. 6 b ) .
interestingly , both the mfe and fluorescence level of k 28 were comparable to those of k 27 and k 29 .
hence , even if the kozak sequence was free of pairing interactions , the sequestering of the upstream region into a stem was enough to guarantee a clear drop in protein expression .
this is further confirmation of the role played by the nucleotides upstream of the kozak sequence in tuning protein expression .
a different mfe mrna secondary structure was obtained for k 33 ( four guanines , intermixed with adenines ) , in which half of the extended kozak sequence and almost the whole upstream region were involved in base - pairing interactions with the cds , giving rise to a long stem .
however , compared to k 35 , where only five nucleotides of the upstream region were locked into a stem with the cyc1 terminator , k 33 showed a higher mfe as well as a higher fluorescence level ( fig. 5 and additional file 1 ) .
finally , for k 32 , k 36 , and k 37 ( with four , three , and two guanines in the upstream region , respectively ) rnafold returned the same mfe as for k 1 .
the corresponding mrna secondary structures were all characterized by the presence of the the giant hairpin ( see additional file 1 ) .
compared to our experimental data , this result was plausible only for k 37 but in apparent disagreement with the measurements for k 32 and k 36 , whose fluorescence levels were significantly lower than that of k 1 ( fig. 5 ) .
in particular , the fluorescence of k 32 only corresponded to about 69 % of that of k 1 .
therefore , it can be argued that in vivo k 32 and k 1 share the same mfe and mrna secondary structure , as suggested by the in silico simulations .
in contrast to the multiple point mutations , of the single point mutations on k 1 , only k 4 caused a modification in the structure of the giant hairpin and a consequent decrease in the mfe .
k 4 carries a guanine at position - 1 that pairs with the cytosine at position - 31 such that the length of the loop is reduced from 32 to 29 nucleotides and the mfe is lowered to - 241.42 kcal / mol ( fig. 4 a ) .
according to our data , this minimal change has no effect on fluorescence expression .
all the other point mutations that induced a fluorescence level significantly higher than that of k 1 ( namely , k 16 , k 47 - k 51 , and k 53 - k 55 ) were characterized by the same mfe and corresponding mrna secondary structure as k 1 , according to the rnafold simulations .
conclusions to date , the role played by 5 ' - utr in eukaryotic cell transcription initiation has not been studied deeply nor clearly understood .
as for s. cerevisiae , two main works in the literature [ 8 , 9 ] showed that the 5 ' - utr is rich in adenine and poor in guanine , mainly in the proximity of the start codon .
the consensus kozak sequence , determined on highly expressed genes , shows a strongly conserved adenine ( frequency > 50 %) at positions - 1 , - 3 , and - 5 , whereas cytosines at positions - 2 and - 4 and a thymine at position - 6 are also strongly present .
adenines at positions - 3 and - 1 are suggested to be necessary for enhancing gene expression .
in contrast , two other works [ 18 , 19 ] showed that several adjacent guanines placed just upstream of the start codon induced a significant drop in protein synthesis .
we analyzed the 5 ' - utr of the constitutive s. cerevisiae cyc1 promoter .
we fused pcyc1min to a reporter protein and quantified the strength of 58 synthetic leader sequences using fluorescence measurements .
we took into account only the 15 nucleotides just upstream of the start codon .
in a previous report , dvir et al .
[ 9 ] examined positions - 1 to - 10 of a different s. cerevisiae gene , rpl8a .
our starting point was the construction of a synthetic 5 ' - utr where each position from - 1 to - 15 was taken by an adenine - - the nucleotide that seems the most favorable for high gene expression .
we called this sequence k 1. with respect to the original cyc1 5 ' - utr ( here termed k 0 ) , k 1 did not represent a significant improvement .
in contrast , a statistically significant enhancement in fluorescence was achieved by single point mutations in k 1 .
surprisingly , a cytosine and a thymine in position - 1 proved to be more efficient than an adenine , which disagrees with previous claims that an adenine at position - 1 is on its own sufficient for enhancing gene expression .
furthermore , point mutations at positions - 4 and - 5 also showed a statistically significant improvement with respect to the fluorescence of k 0 .
in particular , a guanine ( the least frequent nucleotide in s. cerevisiae leader sequences ) at position - 5 resulted in a statistically significant increase in fluorescence , even compared to k 1 .
hence , single point mutations on an adenine background seem to constitute a novel technique for improving translational strength .
we also studied the effects that multiple mutations to guanine can have on gene expression .
here , the starting point was a leader sequence containing the least frequent nucleotides in highly expressed s. cerevisiae genes [ 8 ] at positions - 1 to - 15 .
they were all guanines apart from a cytosine at position - 7 .
this sequence , here termed k 26 , switched off fluorescence expression. by mutating only the extended kozak sequence ( positions - 1 to - 8 ) or the upstream region ( positions - 9 to - 15 ) , we obtained almost identical results , namely about half of the fluorescence expressed by k 1 .
this was the first hint that mutations in the upstream region ( or , more generally , outside the kozak sequence ) can markedly affect gene expression .
furthermore , we showed that gene expression can be tuned just by varying the number of adjacent guanines in the upstream region while keeping the extended kozak sequence made of adenines only .
this represents another possible approach to engineering synthetic promoters that differ in their translational strength .
we also noticed that four guanines intermixed with adenines reduce translation initiation less than four guanines in a row .
this confirms that the effect of point mutations ( multiple or single ) on gene expression is highly context - dependent .
simulations with rnafold led to an explanation for the changes in fluorescence expression observed in the presence of multiple mutations from adenine to guanine ( and cytosine at position - 7 ) .
the k 1 mrna sequence folds into an mfe secondary structure characterized by a giant hairpin whose loop contains the entire - 15 ...
- 1 region .
therefore , in this configuration , both the extended kozak sequence and the upstream region are free from base - pairing interactions .
moreover , this mrna secondary structure returns the highest mfe among the 59 sequences analyzed in this work and seems to foster protein synthesis .
multiple mutations to guanine ( and cytosine ) cause either the extended kozak sequence or the upstream region to be locked into a stem due to base - pairing interactions with the cds or the cyc1 terminator .
as a result , the giant hairpin is destroyed , the mfe is lowered , and fluorescence expression is decreased to different extents .
although it was not possible to identify the precise relationship between mfes and fluorescence levels , our results mostly agree with the notion that stable mrna structures in the 5 ' - utr hinder protein expression .
finally , we carried out single point mutations on the sole upstream region of k 1 and determined whether positions " far " from the start codon played an important role in protein synthesis .
we found that eight sequences , with a single point mutation between positions - 11 and - 14 , produced significant increases in k 1 fluorescence level .
position - 12 turned out to be the most critical , because each mutation led to significantly greater fluorescence .
moreover , the highest increase in fluorescence - - from all 58 synthetic 5 ' - utrs - - was obtained by turning the adenine at position - 13 into a cytosine .
therefore , the leader configuration upstream of the kozak sequence has a marked influence on translation initiation .
as in the reference work by dvir et al .
[ 9 ] , the main limit in our analysis is that it was carried out on a single gene .
hence , the results shown here might be not completely valid for other s. cerevisiae genes .
on the whole , our work shows that 5 ' - utrs can be exploited to generate new libraries of synthetic s. cerevisiae promoters .
in particular , mutations on the 5 ' - utr should not be limited to the kozak sequence but they should also involve upstream non - conserved regions .
as in the cyc1 gene , these modifications might lead to very high increases ( or decreases ) in translation initiation .
however , further studies investigating entire 5 ' - utrs are advisable .
our simulations with rnafold showed how , at the mrna level , interactions between the promoter ( 5 ' - utr ) and either the cds or the terminator ( 3 ' - utr ) sequence influence gene expression considerably .
this notion should be taken into account to improve the modelling of basic modules for eukaryotic gene circuits ( as we previously described in [ 21 ]) .
our hope is that this work will emphasize the fact that part characterization - - a fundamental concept in synthetic biology - - is still far from being achieved and more basic experiments on standard biological parts ( and subparts ) are required for a comprehensive description of the basic components of synthetic gene circuits .
only with such accurate knowledge could synthetic biology be regarded as a proper engineering discipline .
methods plasmid construction backbones for all the plasmids used in this work were either the yeast integrative shuttle - vector prsii406 ( addgene - 35442 , a gift from steven haase ) [ 22 ] or the modified version pmm125 , where the bsai site in the ampicillin resistance gene and the bpii site in the ura3 marker were removed via silent mutations .
the minimal cyc1 promoter ( pcyc1min ) was extracted from the yeast s. cerevisiae genome ( strain fy1679 - 08a , see below ) following the procedure described in [ 23 ] .
every transcription unit expresses the yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein ( yegfp ) obtained from prs31 - glag [ 24 ] ( courtesy of the hasty lab , university of california , san diego , usa ) .
a slightly different version termed yegfpgg ( where the bsai site was removed through a silent mutation ) was used in the plasmids assembled using the golden gate method [ 25 ] .
the cyc1 terminator ( cyc1t ) [ 26 ] placed at the end of every transcription unit was obtained from prs403 - pgal1 - strongsc _ gfp ( addgene - 22316 , a gift from david bartel ) .
plasmids containing 5 ' - utr from k 0 to k 38 were constructed via isothermal assembly [ 27 ] .
those containing 5 ' - utr from k 39 to k 58 were assembled using the golden gate method [ 25 ] .
for this purpose , we built an acceptor vector ( pmm247 ) where 15 - nucleotide - long sequences could be inserted between two bsai cutting sites , namely taca ( i.e. position - 19 ...
- 16 of pcyc1min ) and atgt ( the first four nucleotides of yegfpgg ) .
short dna sequences containing k 39 to k 58 extended with the above bsai sites were prepared by comate bioscience co. , ltd .
( harbin , china ) .
to extract dna sequences from plasmids , we used touchdown pcr .
dna elution from agarose gel was carried out with the qiagen - 28604 dna elution kit .
isothermal assembly required 1 h at 50 degreesc .
for golden gate assembly , the insert ( k i sequences , i : 39 ,... , 58 ) and the pmm247 acceptor vector were combined in an equimolar ratio and mixed with a master mix ( 1 mu l bsai 20 units / mu l , neb - r0535s ; 2 mu l cutsmart buffer neb ; 1 mu l t4 ligase 400 units / mu l , neb - m0202s ; 2 mu l10 mm atp , sigma - aldrich - a7699 ) to a final 15 mu l volume .
the thermocycler program was set to three cycles of 10 min at 40 degreesc and another 10 min at 16 degreesc .
these cycles were followed by 10 min at 50 degreesc , 20 min at at 80 degreesc , and the final temperature was set to 16 degreesc. e. coli competent cells ( strain dh5 alpha , life technology , 18263 - 012 ) transformed with our plasmids ( 30 - s heatshock at 42 degreesc ) were grown overnight at 37 degreesc in lb ( luria - bertani ) broth or plates ( bacto tryptone 10 % , yeast extract 5 % , nacl 10 % , agar 15 % for the plates ) supplied with ampicillin .
plasmid extraction from bacterial cells was carried out using standard methods [ 28 ] .
all plasmids were sequenced ( sanger method ) to check the correctness of the new synthetic constructs .
yeast strain construction our synthetic plasmids were integrated into the genome of the yeast s. cerevisiae strain fy1679 - 08a ( mata ; ura3 - 52 ; leu2 delta1 ; trp1 delta63 ; his3 delta200 ; gal2 ) , euroscarf ( johann wolfgang goethe university , frankfurt , germany ) .
genomic integration was carried out as described in [ 29 ] .
about 5 mu g of plasmidic dna was linearized at the ura3 marker with the restriction enzyme stui ( neb - r0187s ) .
transformed cells were grown on plates containing synthetic selective medium ( sd - ura ; 2 % glucose , 2 % agar ) for about 36 h at 30 degreesc .
flow cytometry yeast cells were grown overnight in synthetic complete medium ( sdc ) at 30 degreesc .
they were diluted in the morning to approximately 1:100 and allowed to grow in sdc for up to 5 h longer , so that their optical density at 600 nm wavelength ( od 600 ) was always between 0.2 and 2.0 ( exponential phase ) .
fluorescence measurements were performed with a bd accuri c6 cytometer ( 488 nm laser , 533 / 30 filter ) .
the facs machine set - up was checked at the beginning and end of each experiment , using fluorescent beads ( alignflow , life technologies - a16500 ) .
reliable measurements were considered as only those where the relative difference between the initial and final values of the peaks of the beads was lower than 5 % .
data were analyzed with the flowcore r - bioconductor package [ 30 ] .
fluorescence levels were compared using welch 's two - sided t - test ( p - value < 0.05 was considered significant ) and were estimated as the mean values of at least three independent experiments ( carried out on different days and each with 30000 recorded samples ) .
standard deviations were calculated on these mean values .
the error on relative fluorescence values ( ratios ) was computed using the error propagation formula .

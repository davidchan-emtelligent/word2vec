the objective of this study was to assess the effects of whole grain tibetan hull - less barley on metabolic related syndrome induced by high - fat - sucrose diets in rats .
the diets were designed to reflect the dietary patterns of chinese individuals (> 30 % energy fat ) with refined wheat flour ( hfs - w ) or tibetan hull - less barley ( hfs - thb ) as the main carbohydrate sources .
rats fed hfs - w had increased body weight , abdominal fat deposition , liver weight , liver fat deposition , triglyceride ( tg ) , fasting blood glucose ( fbg ) , serum fasting insulin ( fins ) , and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) scores , and decreased low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) levels compared to rats fed a basal diet ( bd ) .
however , rats fed hfs - thb had reduced body weight gain , dyslipidemia , and insulin resistance .
these findings indicate that whole tibetan hull - less barley is a functional food that can reduce the prevalence of metabolic related syndrome induced by high - fat - sucrose diets .
tibetan hull - less barley ( thb ) whole grain metabolic related syndrome insulin resistance 1 .
introduction metabolic syndrome ( ms ) comprises a cluster of pathologies : abdominal obesity , hyperglycemia ( insulin resistance or impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes ) , dyslipidemia ( hypertriglyceridemia and / or low hdl - cholesterol ) , and hypertension [ 1 ] .
ms , which has become one of the major public - health problems worldwide , has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes [ 2 ] .
ms is related to lifestyle , particularly to unbalanced energy - rich diets .
epidemiological studies have shown a strong negative relationship between the consumption of whole grains and the risk of developing ms [ 3 ] .
in healthy middle - aged tehranian adults , a higher intake of whole grains is associated with a 25 % lower prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance [ 4 ] .
older adults with higher intakes of whole grain foods ( i.e. , 2.9 servings / day ) have a lower prevalence of ms ( or : 0.46 ; 95 % ci : 0.27 - 0.79 ) compared to subjects with lower whole grain intakes ( i.e. , < 1 serving / day ) [ 5 ] .
pereiar et al. reported that fasting insulin levels were 10 % lower with whole grain diets than with refined grain diets [ 6 ] .
based on these studies , the 2005 dietary guidelines for americans and healthy people 2010 has recommended the consumption of at least three servings of whole grains per day [ 7,8 ] .
tibetan hull - less barley ( thb ) has been a staple food crop in tibet for centuries .
thb accounts for > 97.7 % of the total tibetan barley varieties .
the crop is cold - and drought - tolerant and can be cultivated at high altitudes ; thb is the only crop that can be grown at > 4200 m in the tibetan plateau .
extreme geographical conditions such as intense uv radiation , seasonal drought , and hypoxia contribute to lower crop yield but with plenty of secondary metabolites , including benzoic , cinnmaic acid derivatives , proanthocyanidins , flavonols and amino compounds [ 9,10 ] .
our previous research [ 11 ] has demonstrated that total soluble phenolic compounds and total antioxidant capacity of thb in the outer layers are more than two - fold higher than that of tianjin hull - less barley ( a variety grown in the plain ) .
moreover , among 164 chinese barley cultivars , thb has the highest beta - glucan content ( approximately 8.62 %) [ 12 ] .
over the past decade , thb has received considerable attention due to its health benefits .
epidemiological studies have reported a lower prevalence of hyperlipidemia and diabetes with the consumption of thb [ 13 ] .
in a randomized double - blind trial , xiong et al .
[ 14 ] reported that the dietary intake of whole thb ( w - thb ) significantly reduced plasma cholesterol concentrations , serum triglyceride levels , and body weight in 227 dyslipidemic patients .
similarly , a recent study by li et al. reported that w - thb significantly decreased postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels in healthy adults [ 15 ] .
altogether , these studies strongly support the idea that increasing the consumption of w - thb might be a useful dietary approach to lowering the risk of developing ms. this study assessed the effects of w - thb in rats with ms. the main objectives of this study were to ( 1 ) investigate the effects of a hypo - caloric diet containing w - thb on rats with diet - induced ms and ( 2 ) evaluate whether ms is affected by whole grains , which contain nutrients and bioactive phytochemicals , but are highly caloric .
2. methods 2.1 .
animals a total of 40 male sprague - dawley rats ( 4 - 5 weeks of age ) weighing 170 - 210 g were obtained from zhejiang experimental animal center ( hangzhou , zhejiang , china ) .
the rats were housed ( five per cage ) in an air - conditioned room ( 23 +/ - 2 degreesc and 60 % +/ - 10 % relative humidity ) with 12 - h light and 12 - h dark cycles .
all experimental procedures were approved by the ethical committee for laboratory animals of zhejiang university .

histology of liver as shown in figure 2 , the examination of liver sections of hfs - w rats revealed the presence of a large number of circular lipid droplets .
these lipid droplets were significantly reduced in size and number in hfs - thb rats , which may suggest that w - thb effectively inhibits lipid accumulation in liver tissue .
however , it was not clear what the inclusions were .

in weeks 8 - 15 , fbg did not change in the three experiment groups ; however , fbg remained higher in hfs - w and hfs - thb than in bd. there were no significant differences between hfs - w and hfs - thb during the experiment ( p > 0.05 ) .
after week 8 , fins was higher in hfs - w and hfs - thb than in bd. at week 8 , fins of bd , hfs - w , and hfs - thb was 5.09 +/ - 0.95 miu / l , 8.13 +/ - 0.93 miu / l , and 7.04 +/ - 0.67 miu / l , respectively .
therefore , hfs - thb had a fins value that was 13.41 % lower than that of hfs - w. the three groups had higher fins at week 15 than at week 8 : fins of bd , hfs - w , and hfs - thb increased by 73.28 % , 73.31 % , and 59.38 % , respectively .
however , fins was significantly higher in the hfs - w and hfs - thb groups than in the bd group after 15 weeks .
fins of hfs - w and hfs - thb were 59.75 % and 27.21 % higher than that of bd ( 8.82 +/ - 1.32 miu / l ) , respectively .
in addition , fins of hfs - thb was significantly lower compared with that of hfs - w , which was reduced by approximately 20.37 % from a mean value of 14.09 +/ - 1.64 miu / l. overall , the changes in home - ir scores were similar to those of fins .

at the end of the 15 - week study , home - ir of bd , hfs - w , and hfs - thb was significantly higher than that at the beginning of this study , which indicated that insulin sensitivity was affected by rat growth .
the home - ir scores of bd , hfs - m , and hfs - thb at week 15 were approximately 0.83 , 2.57 , and 1.67 times higher than those at week 0 , respectively .
the home - ir scores of hfs - w and hfs - thb increased more than those of bd. moreover , at week 15 , the home - ir scores of hfs - w and hfs - thb were 0.98 and 0.52 times higher than those of bd , respectively .
however , the consumption of w - thb improved insulin sensitivity .
the home - ir scores of hfs - thb were 23.4 % lower than those of hfs - w ( p < 0.05 ) .
as shown in table 4 , once adjusted for body weight , the fasting insulin differed only at week 15 among the three groups .
further studies are necessary to clarify the relative contributions of weight gain to insulin secretion , insulin sensitivity , and the interaction between them .

4. discussion the results of this study revealed that the long - term consumption of w - thb could ameliorate metabolic related syndrome in rats fed high fat and sucrose diets .
animal models have been used to study metabolic related syndrome in humans ; several studies have focused on the effects of whole grains on the pathogenesis of metabolic related syndrome [ 3,16 ] .
the experimental design of these studies varied considerably contributing to different results .
some studies reported that whole grains improve fasting glucose levels , fasting and acute insulin concentrations , and glucose responses [ 17,18,19 ] .
however , other studies have failed to show any effect of whole grains on glucose metabolism [ 20,21 ] .
additionally , some studies reported decreased total cholesterol , ldl - c , and increased hdl - c from whole grain - rich diets [ 17,22 ] .
however , andersson et al .
[ 23 ] and brownlee et al. reported no significant effects of whole grains on lipid levels [ 20 ] .
in 2005 , the international diabetes federation ( idf ) outlined the clinical diagnosis criteria for ms : central obesity and any two of the following four factors , high tg levels , low hdl - c levels , high blood pressure , or high fasting plasma glucose [ 24 ] .
the sd rat model is commonly used to assess diet - induced metabolic related syndrome [ 25 ] .
the world health organization ( who ) recommends that fat intakes and refined carbohydrate intakes should be < 30 % and < 10 % , respectively , of the total calories .
in this study , a high - fat - sucrose diet with refined wheat flour had 21.5 % - 21.9 % protein , 35.3 % - 36.5 % fat , and 42.0 % - 42.7 % carbohydrates , which has a similar composition to that of chinese diets [ 26 ] .
the results revealed that high - fat - sucrose diets can induce abdominal obesity , dyslipidemia , hyperglycemia , and insulin resistance in rats , consistent with the results of previous studies [ 27,28 ] .
refined wheat flour is the starchy endosperm left after removing the pericarp seed coat , aleurone , and germ ( including large amounts of fiber , micronutrients , protein and phytochemicals ) .
the nutrient composition of refined wheat is different to that of the original whole grain seed [ 29 ] .
to the author 's knowledge , this is the first study that assessed the effects of w - thb on diet - induced metabolic related syndrome in an animal model .
the consumption of w - thb ameliorated the development of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance and was useful in weight control .
the hfs - w rats had higher body weight and visceral fat than the hfs - thb rats .
similar clinical findings have been found in obese men by koh - banerjee et al. , who reported that whole grains are more satiating than refined grains [ 30 ] .
additionally , w - thb reduced visceral fat .
it is noteworthy that , in the present study , w - thb significantly decreased the epididymal fat absolute weight of hfs - w rats by 37.98 % ; however , the perirenal fat absolute weight decreased by 18.20 % .
the reason for the different effects of w - thb on epididymal fat and perirenal fat is unknown .
lipid droplets represent an inert storage pool of tg [ 31 ] .
the high - fat - sucrose diet resulted in an accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes , which contributes to liver damage , such as non - alcoholic fatty liver disease .
the number of lipid droplets in the liver of hfs - thb rats was lower in comparison to that of hfs - w rats .
therefore , the consumption of w - thb might improve serum lipid profiles by suppressing the accumulation of body fat even with the consumption of high - fat diets .
adiposity and insulin resistance are hallmarks of ms ; the latter may be closely tied to low grade inflammatory responses to diet [ 32 ] .
the results of this study revealed that there were no differences in the glycemic parameters among groups after being fed for 4 weeks ; however , fbg , fins , and homa - ir of the hfs groups were higher compared to those of bd. the increase in fbg , fins , and homa - ir from week 0 to week 15 indicated that insulin sensitivity was progressively impaired by diet .
furthermore , this study revealed an improvement in insulin resistance ( lower homa - ir scores ) with the consumption of w - thb for 8 to 15 weeks .
the consumption of w - thb had beneficial effects on glucose and insulin responses .
the results are consistent with the findings obtained from animal and clinical trials , which revealed that the consumption of whole grains may protect against type 2 diabetes by improving glucose control and insulin sensitivity [ 6,33 ] .
hfs significantly increased hepatic glycogen levels .
in the liver , glucose is produced by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis .
free fatty acids increase gluconeogenesis and suppress glycogenolysis by activating glycogen synthase and inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase [ 34,35 ] .
on the other hand , hyperinsulinemia suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis to impair glucose storage in liver [ 36 ] .
previous studies have suggested that a compensatory reduction in glycogenolysis ameliorates the ffa - induced increase in gluconeogenesis from elevating hepatic glucose production .
this is defined as " hepatic autoregulation " [ 37 ] .
homa - ir scores revealed that the consumption of w - thb improved insulin sensitivity and reduced fins in the hfs - thb group relative to the hfs - w group .
this may be the reason responsible for the lower hepatic glycogen content in hfs - w rats .
the precise mechanisms by which w - thb improves metabolic related syndrome in rats were not explored in this study .
energy intake did not differ among the groups ; therefore , the reduced body weight gain in the hfs - thb group was not attributed to a reduced energy intake .
the effect of w - thb on diet - induced metabolic related syndrome might be attributed to the synergistic effects of its nutrients and bioactive compounds. from 164 barley cultivars originating in china , thb has the highest beta - glucan content [ 23 ] .
moreover , the beta - glucan content of major tibetan cultivars is higher than that of harrington , cdc richard , and cdc buck in canada and is significantly higher than that of wheat and rice [ 38 ] .
consumption of a diet high in beta - glucan ameliorates fatty liver and insulin resistance in mice fed high - fat diets .
the beta - glucan diet promoted hepatic insulin signaling by decreasing serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 , activating akt , and decreasing mrna levels of glucose - 6 - phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [ 39 ] .
researchers have reported that components of barley other than beta - glucan have beneficial effects on human health .
qian et al. treated hyperlipidemic sd rats with w - thb bran oil .
the bran oil group had significant reductions in tc , tg , and ldl - c and had a significant increase in hdl - c. bran oil has a high content of linoleic acid ( 75.08 % of the total fatty acids ) [ 40 ] .
linoleic acid and other n - 6 fatty acids decrease serum tc and ldl - c levels [ 41,42 ] .
additionally , w - thb has a number of protective compounds , i.e. , insoluble fiber , which increases transit time and fecal bulk ; zn , se , and nicotinic acid , which participate in hormonal activation and synthesis ; and polyphenols , which regulate gene expression [ 29 ] .
5. conclusions by replacing refined wheat flour in a high - fat - sucrose diet with w - thb , the prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome in rats decreased .
these findings indicate that w - thb improves metabolic syndrome induced by high - fat - sucrose diets .
however , the mechanisms by which w - thb affects the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome are unknown and require further investigation .

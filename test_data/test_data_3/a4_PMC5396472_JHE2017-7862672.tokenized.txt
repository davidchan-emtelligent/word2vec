reusing the data from healthcare information systems can effectively facilitate clinical trials ( cts ) .
how to select candidate patients eligible for ct recruitment criteria is a central task .
related work either depends on dba ( database administrator ) to convert the recruitment criteria to native sql queries or involves the data mapping between a standard ontology / information model and individual data source schema .
this paper proposes an alternative computer - aided ct recruitment paradigm , based on syntax translation between different dsls ( domain - specific languages ) .
in this paradigm , the ct recruitment criteria are first formally represented as production rules .
the referenced rule variables are all from the underlying database schema .
then the production rule is translated to an intermediate query - oriented dsl ( e.g. , linq ) .
finally , the intermediate dsl is directly mapped to native database queries ( e.g. , sql ) automated by orm ( object - relational mapping ) .

introduction clinical trials ( cts ) are the building blocks for evidence - based medicine ( ebm ) .
clinical trials are typically performed under the guidance of clinical trial protocols ( ctps ) , which are standardized guidelines for conducting ct. a ctp contains several components , including purpose , study design , recruitment criteria of subjects , treatment of subjects , assessment of efficacy , assessment of safety , adverse events , quality control and assurance , and ethics .
among them , " recruitment criteria " ( or " eligibility criteria ") is an essential step for conducting cts .
the recruitment criteria specify a set of common features that define the population subset of interest .
these features include age , gender , habit , diagnosis , stage of disease development , surgery history , and genetic data .
the recruitment criteria usually contain both " inclusion " and " exclusion " rules , which define required and unwanted features , respectively .
for certain cts , the criteria could be quite complex , making the patient enrollment very challenging. with the rapid development of healthcare it ( hit ) , electronic patient data acquired during the clinical care process offers a new approach to facilitate the recruitment procedure .
much work has been reported concerning the previously mentioned approach .
the traditional way of this approach usually relies on dba ( database administrator ) or clinical engineers .
the criteria are initially written in natural language form by ct protocol authors or clinical researchers .
then , the engineers translate the narrative criteria into native database query language , such as sql .
due to the professional barrier and possible ambiguity of natural language , such criteria translation can be inaccurate .
secondly , the involvement of engineers has increased both human resource and communication cost .
for these reasons , some researchers chose to develop computer - aided tools or clinical trial recruitment support systems ( ctrss ) to facilitate the recruitment procedure .
the following manuscript will introduce some of the related work .
2. related work european researchers built the transform query workbench tool [ 1 ] to author , store , and execute clinical data queries to identify potential subjects for clinical studies .
this tool can create recruitment criteria in computable representations .
then the criteria are translated into executable queries in institution - specific databases .
the query workbench tool uses the clinical data integration model ( cdim ) [ 2 ] as an intermediate standard ontology , so it can support queries across multiple heterogeneous data sources .
the uk cancergrid [ 3 ] project designs a widely accepted clinical trial model by controlled vocabulary and common data elements ( cdes ) .
based on this model , a cancer data query system has been developed which supports data sharing across cancergrid - compliant clinical trial boundaries .
penberthy et al .
[ 4 ] designed a ct matching system .
the system allows users to define the recruitment criteria through a form - based gui tool .
then the system will perform periodical automatic screening against patients in the information system .
matched subjects will be sent to researchers via emails .
the breastcancertrials.org [ 5 ] project creates a ct matching website whose targeting audience is patients .
it uses self - reported patient data collected by web - based forms to match against existing registered cancer cts and recommend patients with available cts .
patients can also redirect themselves to participating research sites .
breastcancertrials.org can increase patients' awareness to participate cancer cts , and can improve patient data usage among multiple ct research groups .
there are also several experimental researches that use more sophisticated methods , such as natural language processing ( nlp ) [ 6 ] and semantic web [ 7 ] , to facilitate the automatic extraction and comparison of recruitment criteria and patient data .
generally speaking , much research work focuses on querying across heterogeneous sources , and uses form - alike structured data entry ( sde ) techniques to author recruitment criteria .
these sde tools are usually designed according to some intermediate information model ( or ontology ) .
based on this model , the recruitment criteria and referenced data elements can be defined in formal representations , which have the unique advantage in data exchange and semantic interoperability .
however , this paradigm requires mapping between the intermediate model and individual databases when performing patient queries .
such mapping work can be quite knowledge - intensive and time - consuming , and due to information granularity and semantic differences , the mapping of certain data elements can be extremely difficult or even unsupported. with such concern , this paper tries an alternative method that uses direct syntax translation to avoid model mapping .
the following manuscript will introduce the method and a corresponding case study in detail .
3. method 3.1 .
knowledge representation of clinical trial recruitment criteria the first step of this study is the knowledge representation of recruitment criteria and relevant patient data .
an analysis on knowledge representation will help to determine whether a certain kind of information model or formal language has the ability to represent all related entities ( e.g. , concepts and rules ) in this domain .
following are two typical recruitment criteria used in clinical trials .
these two examples are related to retinopathy of prematurity ( rop ) , which is the target disease in our case study .
example 1 .
consider the following : [ aim of ct ] assess the anti - neovascularization activity of intravitreal bevacizumab , as determined by regression of neovascular vessels of retinopathy of prematurity ( rop ) , in neonates with acute stage 3 rop in zone i or posterior zone ii with plus disease .
[ recruitment criteria ] birth weight <= 1500 grams gestational age <= 30 weeks diagnosis = stage 3 rop in zone i or posterior zone ii drug use = bevacizumab ( avastin ( r )) without congenital systemic anomaly without congenital ocular abnormality .
example 2 .
consider the following : [ aim of ct ] assess pan - vegf ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) blockade for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity .
[ recruitment criteria ] gestational age <= 30 weeks gestational age <= 36 1 / 7 weeks diagnosis = type 1 pre - threshold rop no prior treatment without media opacity precluding fundus visualization without ocular or periocular infection ( s ) .
as seen from the examples , typical ct recruitment criteria consist of a set of medical concepts ( e.g. , birth weight , gestational age , and diagnosis ) and a rule condition composed of these concepts ( e.g. , birth weight <= 1500 grams && gestational age <= 30 weeks && ( diagnosis = stage 3 rop in zone i || diagnosis = posterior zone ii ) ) .
in this study , we chose the production rule as the knowledge representation for ct recruitment criteria .
in runtime , the data sources should feed the rule with actual patient data for succeeding query or reasoning .
3.2 .
patient query for ct recruitment by syntax translation clinical data can be conveyed in two styles .
one is natural language ( nl ) , which is extensively used by humans in daily life .
the other is formal language ( fl ) or domain - specific language ( dsl ) , which is usually designed for a specific purpose and contains a limited set of symbols and syntax .
typical fls / dsls include the arabic numbers and arithmetic symbols used in mathematics , the molecular formula in chemistry , and programming languages .
the data carried by nl are usually " unstructured " while the data conveyed by fl / dsl are mostly " structured. " though fl / dsl may lack expressiveness than nl , they are much more suitable for computers to parse and process .
the essence of patient query in ct recruitment is the translation of nl ( recruitment criteria from ctp or clinical researchers ) to fl / dsl ( e.g. , sql ) .
although there is related work that uses nlp techniques to facilitate the translation of nl to fl / dsl , there is a gap between research and real application .
nlp ( especially for chinese nl ) is still premature and many studies use the more reliable sde instead .
in these studies , the recruitment criteria are first authored in certain formal representation by sde .
next , the formally represented criteria need to be converted to database - specific queries ( e.g. , sql ) .
as mentioned before , many studies depend on a sharable model or ontology and have to handle the mapping between the sharable model and individual data sources .
such a mapping work can be a quite complicated , knowledge - intensive , and time - consuming task .
as an alternative , this paper proposed a method based on dsl syntax translation , other than ontology mapping .
our method directly uses the underlying database 's schema as a reference model for the sde tool and its generated production rules. that is , all rule variables in the sde tool come from data fields in the database schema .
for example , the sde tool outputs a production rule "[ birthweight ] < 1.0 && [ gestationalageinweeks ] < 30 " .
in this rule , the "[ birthweight ]" and "[ gestationalageinweeks ]" rule variables have corresponding " birthweight " and " gestationalageinweeks " data fields in the underlying database schema .
the next step is to convert such production rules to query - oriented dsl .
the query - oriented dsl is provided in many modern programming languages , such as java , c # , and vb.net .
take linq ( language - integrated query ) as an example .
in microsoft . net framework , linq is a language subset of c # and vb.net .
linq supports nearly 40 operators , including " select ," " from ," " in ," " where ," and " order by. " with linq , programmers can directly write sql - style c # or vb.net codes to query underlying data providers , such as orm ( object - relational mapping ) , odbc ( open database connect ) , or xml ( extensible markup language ) files .
because our case study is conducted in the context of microsoft.net framework and the sql server relational database , we will use linq for demonstration purposes .
for other technical platforms , there are also equivalent technologies , such as jinq , linq4j , and jaque , for the java platform .
after the production rule is converted to linq , linq to native - sql conversion is automatically supported by the orm provider , and no extra effort is required .
in the previously mentioned process , the production rule , linq , and sql are all strictly constrained fls / dsls , so the syntactic conversion between them is explicit and unambiguous .
in addition , these dsls all use the underlying database schema as the reference model , so there is no need for a complex concept mapping .
such concept mapping is a well - known issue in medical informatics , aka the " curly braces " problem [ 8 ] , which involves mapping external clinical data to rule variables in the rule expression .
figure 1 illustrates the comparison of different paradigms .
paradigm a depends on dba to translate clinicians' narrative recruitment criteria to native database queries .
as mentioned before , such manual translation can sometimes be inaccurate due to professional barrier and the ambiguous nature of nl. paradigm b uses sde to author formally represented criteria based on a sharable model .
the formally represented criteria are then translated to sql by underlying mappings between the sharable model and individual database .
paradigm c , which is proposed in this paper , also uses sde to author recruitment criteria in the form of the production rule , but does not involve any data mapping jobs .
in the following manuscript , we will introduce a case study to demonstrate our method and give more details on system implementation .
4. case study and system implementation 4.1 .
clinical settings the case study is conducted in shenzhen eye hospital , which is a 200 - bed class iii specialized hospital in china .
since 2013 , we have been developing a rop ( retinopathy of prematurity ) management system for the pediatric retinal surgery department .
rop , aka terry syndrome , is a common eye disease for prematurely born babies , especially those with low birth weight and early gestation age .
rop is related with disorganized growth of retinal blood vessels resulting in retinal scarring or detachment .
without early screening and timely intervention , rop can lead to severe visual impairments or even blindness .
rop has become a major reason for children blindness .
it is estimated that china has at least 0.2 million rop newborns each year .
rop has now become a nonneglectable problem in china , whereas rop - oriented information systems are scarce on the chinese market .
under this circumstance , we built this rop management system to help clinicians to manage rop screening information and track patient disease development .
the rop management system is also designed as a regional telemedicine system .
it covers not only the rop screening cases in shenzhen eye hospital , but also those from partner hospitals , such as shenzhen dapeng - district maternity hospital , meizhou people 's hospital ( guangdong province , china ) , and puning people 's hospital ( fujian province , china ) .
these partner hospitals can upload rop - related data ( e.g. , retcam imaging , newborn info ) to central data repository via the system .
then the rop medical team in shenzhen eye hospital will help to diagnose these cases .
until now , the system has enrolled more than 22,238 patient cases .
the demo version of the system is http :// ropd.brahma.pub. with the advent of " big data era ," how to effectively use the collected data has become a great concern for both clinicians and researchers .
supporting clinical trial ( ct ) is one of the typical applications of clinical data .
4.2 .
computer - aided ct recruitment based on paradigm c proposed in figure 1 , we developed a computer - aided ct recruitment module as a subsystem in the rop management system .
the kernel idea of this system is to reuse the patient data in the central data repository for clinical research purposes .
as mentioned before , the ct recruitment criteria vary from study to study .
to fulfill different requirements , we developed a versatile sde tool ( figure 2 ) by which clinicians can author customized search patterns .
the output of the sde tool are production rules , as the formal representation of ct recruitment criteria .
after the production rule is generated , it needs to be converted to native queries towards the underlying data repository .
figure 3 gives a concrete example of this conversion process .
in figure 3 , the production rule is first translated to linq lambda expressions ( the anonymous function inside the " where " clause ) .
then , the linq is automatically translated to a corresponding native sql query by orm .
it should be noted that both the linq and sql code snippets in figure 3 use only one entity set / data table : " integratedview. " in reality , patient - related data are often dispersed among multiple data tables .
for example , in our rop management system , there are " patient master table ," " patient visit table ," and " patient surgery table. " sometimes , users have to make joint queries between multiple tables .
in order to reduce complexity , we created a database view " integratedview " by joining existing tables .
although " integratedview " is a " virtual table ," it is a fully functioning searchable object just as physical tables are , and it is equally supported by orm .
such a view not only integrates data from multiple tables , but also reduces complexity by providing a unified logical schema .
this schema is referenced by all modules across the systems , including the following : ( 1 ) the data fields ( figure 2 ) used to compose production rules ; ( 2 ) the entity set (" domaindbcontext.integratedview ") and entity properties ( e.g. , " x.surgery ," " x.birthweight ") in linq ; and ( 3 ) and the final sql code transformed by orm .
based on the dsl - conversion process , the original ct recruitment criteria represented in production rule has been ultimately converted to a native sql statement on the underlying database .
the returned patients will be shown as an html table .
users can export the search result into excel or csv ( comma - separated value ) files .
they can also check each individual patient , and assign a specific " ct research tag " to this patient .
4.3 .
evaluation the ct recruitment system was first brought on line in august 2015 .
until now ( november 2016 ) , system logs show there have been 230 user queries .
although we have not yet conducted a large - scale scientific evaluation on the system , we have collected plenty of feedbacks from both end users and clinical engineers .
based on these feedbacks , several aspects of the system can be evaluated .
( 1 ) implementation cost .
as mentioned before , the criteria authoring sde tools used in many related works are based on a shared information model or ontology , and the mapping of the shared model to native database queries can be quite complicated and time consuming .
the method proposed in this paper does not use such an intermediate model , so the mapping effort is saved and the implementation cost is relatively low .
in addition , this method uses linq as an intermediate dsl .
because both linq and the recruitment criteria production rules are strictly constrained dsls , the conversion between them is unambiguous and easy to achieve .
what is more , linq can use orm as the data provider , so the conversion between linq and sql can be automated by orm .
( 2 ) dsl expression power .
in this study , the sde tool uses production rule to author ct recruitment criteria .
the expression power of the dsl determines how well the criteria can be represented and processed by the information system .
table 1 shows the operators and data types used in the production rule dsl .
although the dsl only supports a limited set of operators ( e.g. , it does not support assignment "=" and arithmetic operators "+ , - , * , /") , it has satisfied the ct recruitment requirements in 230 query tasks since its first deployment .
the expression power of this dsl lies in two aspects : ( 1 ) complex rules can be composed by the combination of fundamental primitives .
( 2 ) the wild card supported in this system effectively handles the free - text data fields .
in the production rule dsl , "%" represents any text and can be used to compose complicated literal patterns .
this wild card is natively supported by the underlying sql engine .
( 3 ) performance .
a quantitative evaluation of the system performance is carried out on a cloud - computing virtual machine ( cpu : dual core 2.39 ghz , ram : 4 gb , os : windows server 2012 r2 datacenter 64 - bit edition , db : sql server 2012 express ) .
the total consumed time of a ct recruitment query task contains 4 parts : ( 1 ) rule validation .
the system first checks whether the rule expression can be parsed as a well - structured tree ( using the antlr library ) .
( 2 ) dsl translation : " production rule - > linq - > sql . "
( 3 ) sql query : the query execution time by the underlying db server .
( 4 ) client processing : time consumed by the web browser , including ajax calls to the server side and html rendering ( show server - returned records in web page ) .
three ct recruitment rules in different complexity are tested .
as seen from table 2 , the most time - consuming parts are the sql query and client processing , while the rule validation and dsl translation cost little .
it can also been seen that as the rule complexity grows up , the consumed time of the dsl translation process and the underlying sql server does not scale up dramatically .
this shows that the computer - aided ct recruitment system has a good performance curve in regard to rule complexity .
( 4 ) rule variable extensibility .
after the first release of the ct recruitment system , one frequent request posed by end users is supporting more data fields ( rule variables ) .
in the beginning , we only provided a few basic data fields in the rule authoring tool , such as birthday , gestation age , birth weight , and diagnosis .
however , as users conduct more cts , they continually request to extend more data fields , such as family disease history , drug use during pregnancy , and cpap ( continuous positive airway pressure ) treatment .
to meet these frequent requests , we developed the rule authoring sde tool based on pure web - client technologies ( html and javascript ) , and the rule authoring tool is decoupled from server - side rule parsing and execution logics .
when needing to extend a new rule variable , clinical engineers only need to extend a few lines of html and javascript codes for the authoring tool .
because the rule variable name and data type are the same as the corresponding data field in the database , the recruitment criteria rule produced by the authoring tool can be directly parsed and executed by the successive modules without any further modification .
in this sense , the rule variable extensibility is quite satisfying and the system maintenance workload is greatly reduced .
( 5 ) query accuracy and recall rate .
accuracy and recall rate are the two common measures for assessing query systems .
for our system , we found that these two measures depend on how well the users write the rule expressions .
the system is just an " executor " of the search rule .
as there is no nlp or fuzzy - logic module in the system that could bring " uncertainty " or " ambiguity ," the system itself does not compromise the overall query accurate and recall rate. by the rule authoring tool , the users can constantly improve query accuracy and recall rate by routine techniques , such as joining multiple variable conditions , increasing or decreasing thresholds , and adding more logical branches .
5. conclusions and discussions the ct recruitment system has been used in shenzhen eye hospital for more than a year .
clinical evaluation and feedback has proven its usability .
the system is also well received by system developers and clinical engineers : the development and maintenance cost is significantly low , and the extensibility is also satisfying .
such positive reviews are mainly due to two features of the system .
( 1 ) the system directly uses the underlying database schema as a reference model for all related modules , such as the rule authoring tool , the intermediate linq code , and the final sql query .
in this way , the system complexity and data - mapping efforts are greatly reduced .
( 2 ) the system uses the query - oriented dsl ( e.g. , linq in c # and vb.net ; jinq , linq4j , and jaque in java ) as an intermediate formal language .
such dsl uses similar syntax as production rules and sql , and are supported by orm data providers .
in this way , the translation process from recruitment criteria to native database queries is greatly simplified .
compared to other related work , this study has several limitations and arguments .
( 1 ) data integration and knowledge sharing .
much existing related work focus on how to achieve data sharing and data query across heterogeneous clinical data sources .
the core method of these works is a common ontology or data model .
for each data source , a middleware or data mapping module is provided to map the individual database to the shared model .
the rule authoring tool also depends on the shared model , so the recruitment criteria are represented in a sharable computable form , and can be distributed as sharable knowledge assets .
on the other hand , because the rop management system in our case study already has a central data repository that collects and stores data from multiple hospitals ( in other words , the data integration work has been shifted down to the underlying data repository ) , we do not focus on the data integration issue from heterogeneous data sources .
our method does not need a shared ontology or data mapping middleware .
however , the disadvantage is also apparent : the recruitment criteria rules created by the authoring tool are tightly coupled with the local database schema .
in other words , the rules are " institution - specific " and are difficult to be distributed as sharable knowledge assets .
( 2 ) extending rule variables .
as mentioned before , the rule variables provided by the rule authoring sde tool come from the underlying database schema .
in this way , the rule variables referenced in the rule expression can be " recognized " and " processed " by all related modules in the system .
such a design incurred some argument : what if the user wants to add a medical concept / rule variable that does not exist in current database schema ?
we can analyze this argument in 3 cases : ( a ) the concept is a high - level or coarse - grained concept , compared to the data fields in the database .
for this case , the high - level concept can usually be composed by existing fine - grained items .
for example , a user wants to use a " most severe diagnosis " concept , and the database has " most severe diagnosis od " and " most severe diagnosis os " data fields ( od = right eye , os = left eye ) .
a criteria rule of "[ most severe diagnosis ] = rop _ stage4a " concept can be represented as "[ most severe diagnosis od ] = rop _ stage4a || [ most severe diagnosis os ] = rop _ stage4a " .
( b ) the concept is a low - level or fine - grained concept .
it is usually more difficult and complex to handle this case .
for example , the user wants to use " rop zone " and " rop stage " as rule variables , but the database only has a string - typed " diagnosis " data field .
a rule of "[ rop zone ] = 1 && [ rop stage ] = 3 " can be represented as "[ diagnosis ] = % zone1stage3 % || [ diagnosis ] = % stage 3 in zone 1 %" (% is a wild card ) .
however , due to the unconstraint nature of natural language , not all eligible patients can be covered by the previously mentioned rule , which will compromise the recall rate .
moreover , for many cases , it can even be impossible to compose an equal representation with coarse - grained data fields .
( c ) the concept is totally new to the current database .
for example , the user wants to do some genotype research , but there are no genetic data fields in the underlying database .
for these cases , the only solution in the context of our proposed method is to extend the database schema .
in summary , case ( a ) is well supported in the system , case ( b ) is partially supported , and case ( c ) is not supported .
for unsupported cases , the only feasible solution is to extend the database schema to add new data fields .
( 3 ) make use of unstructured clinical data .
in this case study , the data stored in the rop management system are mostly well formatted and structured .
however , some relevant patient information still remains in the non - structured form ( e.g. , scanned handwritten retcam report , and eye surgery record ) .
how to use these narrative data is a long - existing problem faced by clinical researchers , and the promising nlp technologies have always been a hot research area .
joint query on both structured and nonstructured data will be a meaningful research topic for our ct recruitment system .
another kind of important nonstructured data is medical imaging .
for rop , the retcam image is a very important evidence for diagnosis .
how to extract morphological or even physiological information from the retcam image is a challenging and meaningful task .
combining the imaging data will further improve the patient query result .

paradigm a depends on clinical engineers or dba to translate clinical researchers' natural language representation of recruitment criteria into database - specific query language , for example , sql .
paradigm b uses sde tools to author formally represented criteria based on a sharable model .
the criteria are then translated to sql by the underlying mapping between the sharable model and individual database .
paradigm c uses sde to author recruitment criteria in the form of the production rule , which is then translated into linq syntax .
linq to sql conversion is naturally supported by orm - like technologies .
dba = database administrator ; sde = structured data entry ; dsl = domain - specific language ; linq = language - integrated query ; sql = structured query language ; orm = object - relational mapping .

the left panel is a list of data fields that can be used as rule variables in the search patterns .
these data fields come from the database schema of the central data repository .
the right panel is a graphical rule editor .
it supports conditional predicates ( composed of rule variables and comparison operators , e.g. , [ birthweight ] <= 1.5 ) , logical operators ( and , or , and not ) , and parentheses ( specify precedence ) .
for each rule variable , the available comparison operators are strictly confined based on its data type .
if the variable is numeric or date type , allowed comparison operators will be ">= , <= , > , < , = , !=" .
if the variable is string type , the allowed comparison operator will be "=," and the rhs ( right - hand side ) constant can be a string literal with wild cards ("%") .
the sequence of rule components can be adjusted by drag and drop .
furthermore , the graphical editor can generate a rule expression into the textual editor .
the textual editor also allows the user to directly edit rule expression with autocomplete ( intellisense ) utilities .

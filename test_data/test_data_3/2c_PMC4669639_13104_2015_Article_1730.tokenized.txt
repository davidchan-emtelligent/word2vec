background we recently reported that one may be able to predict with high accuracy the chemical mechanism of an enzyme by employing a simple pattern recognition approach : a k nearest neighbour rule with k = 1 ( k1nn ) and 321 interpro sequence signatures as enzyme features .
the nearest - neighbour rule is known to be highly sensitive to errors in the training data , in particular when the available training dataset is small .
this was the case in our previous study , in which our dataset comprised 248 enzymes annotated against 71 enzymatic mechanism labels from the macie database .
in the current study , we have carefully re - analysed our dataset and prediction results to " explain " why a high variance k1nn rule exhibited such remarkable classification performance .
results we find that enzymes with different chemical mechanism labels in this dataset reside in barely overlapping subspaces in the feature space defined by the 321 features selected .
these features contain the appropriate information needed to accurately classify the enzymatic mechanisms , rendering our classification problem a basic look - up exercise .
this observation dovetails with the low misclassification rate we reported .
conclusion our results provide explanations for the " anomaly " - - a basic nearest - neighbour algorithm exhibiting remarkable prediction performance for enzymatic mechanism despite the fact that the feature space was large and sparse .
our results also dovetail well with another finding we reported , namely that interpro signatures are critical for accurate prediction of enzyme mechanism .
we also suggest simple rules that might enable one to inductively predict whether a novel enzyme possesses any of our 71 predefined mechanisms .
keywords enzyme mechanism interpro signatures nearest - neighbour issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 findings identification of unknown protein functions is essential for understanding biological processes and beyond [ 1 , 2 ] .
enzymes are proteins whose function is to catalyse chemical reactions in a living cell .
ascertaining enzymatic mechanisms can have important applications for pharmaceutical and industrial processes in which catalysts are involved [ 1 ] .
for example , identifying the catalytic mechanism ( s ) of an enzyme could lead to designing new biocatalysts that give significant cost savings over non - biological alternatives in sectors such as laundry , deodorants , foods and agriculture [ 1 ] .
unlike predicting enzymatic functions at the level of the chemical reaction performed [ 2 - 4 ] , the problem of predicting by which molecular mechanism a particular enzyme operates has not been well researched [ 1 ] .
two of us , de ferrari and mitchell , have recently looked into this question .
in that work , we utilised a pattern recognition approach to predict chemical mechanisms from enzyme sequences [ 1 ] - - to the best of our knowledge , that study was the first attempt to predict enzymatic mechanism in this way .
one notable aspect of that work was the excellent prediction success rate of over 96 % for 248 test enzymes - - albeit in a leave - one - out setting - - even though the training dataset was small and the simple k nearest neighbour rule with k = 1 ( k1nn ) [ 5 , 6 ] was the algorithm employed for pattern classification .
the k1nn rule is well known to be highly sensitive to errors in the training set [ 7 ] , in particular when the training dataset is small [ 7 - 9 ] .
for example , the number of training examples required for a k1nn rule to achieve high classification or prediction accuracy grows exponentially with the number of irrelevant features ( noise ) [ 7 , 9 ] .
in the light of the " anomaly " described above , we have re - analysed that mechanism dataset and our previous classification results - - mainly to understand and explain , if possible , the high prediction success rate achieved .
in the following section , we briefly describe our previous work .
the " results " section presents our new findings , and the final section gives our concluding remarks .
to our knowledge , our study was the first attempt at bulk prediction of enzymatic mechanism from protein sequence [ 1 ] .
the predictive model was an empirical and observational model [ 10 ] based on the concept of pattern classification .
formally , a pattern classification problem deals with the optimal assignment of an object to one of j predefined classes , categories or labels , \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ omega = \ left \{ {\ omega _{ 1 } ,\ omega _{ 2 } , \ ldots ,\ omega _{ j } } \ right \}$$\ end { document } omega = omega1,omega2 ,... , omegaj , whereby it is assumed that the object is adequately characterized by l features , xi with i = 1 , 2 , ... , l. typically , the object is represented by an l - dimensional vector x , whose elements ( x1 , x2 ... , xi ) are discriminatory features that ideally can identify the object with a low misclassification error rate .
in this regard , the classification task is equivalent to establishing a mapping 1 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ f :\ chi \ to \ omega $$\ end { document } f : chi - - > omegafrom the feature space chi into the class space omega , such that \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ x \ in \ chi $$\ end { document } xinchi is assigned to its appropriate class label \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ omega _{ j } \ in \ omega $$\ end { document } omegajinomega , where j = 1 , 2 , ... , j. each point in the class space has a corresponding region ( s ) or subspace ( s ) in the feature space defined by the l features .
in our previous study , the feature xi denotes absence ( 0 ) or presence ( 1 ) of an interpro signature for an enzyme sequence , i.e. , \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ x _{ i } = \{ 0,1 \}$$\ end { document } xi ={ 0,1 } .
in other words , chi was a binary feature space \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ chi = \ left \{ { 0,1 } \ right \}^{ l }$$\ end { document } chi = 0,1l .
the class space omega comprised j discrete points each representing one of the enzyme mechanism labels omegaj , extracted from version 3.0 of the macie ( mechanism , annotation and classification in enzymes ) database [ 11 - 13 ] .
the mapping algorithm was the simple k1nn classifier .
this algorithm can be basically viewed as a dictionary search [ 14 ]. that is to say , all the data points allotted for training are stored in a memory ( a dictionary in chi ) , and a test data point is classified to the class label or labels \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ omega _{ j }$$\ end { document } omegaj of the closest point in the dictionary , i.e. , in chi .
the specific implementation used in our calculations was mulan 's brknn algorithm [ 5 , 15 ] .
generally speaking , the integration process carried out by interpro 's curators removes many of the redundant signature matches that might otherwise occur .
this results in a relatively small number of interpro signatures being present for the typical sequence in this dataset .
thus , the squared nearest neighbour distance often takes small integer values , and it is common to find plural nearest neighbours an equal distance away .
in this case , the label ( or label set ) most common amongst the ring of nearest neighbours is assigned .
the mechanism dataset consists of 248 enzymes annotated against 71 macie labels , where each enzyme is represented by 321 interpro signatures - - i.e. , l and j are 321 and 71 , respectively .
we employed a leave - one - out validation scheme : 247 of the enzymes whose mechanisms were known were utilised as a " dictionary " and the mechanism ( s ) of the one remaining enzyme was predicted , this processes being repeated 248 times .
the simple pattern recognition approach yielded an excellent prediction success rate of over 96 % for the 248 test enzymes .
methods in the present work , we are not directly concerned with the question of defining enzyme mechanisms ; instead , we just use the mechanism dataset .
we focus on finding the reasons why the k1nn rule gave us such good classification results for this small dataset , its size being limited by the considerable experimental effort required to characterise enzyme mechanisms .
while directly visualising the 321 dimensional feature space \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ chi = \ left \{ { 0,1 } \ right \}^{ l = 321 }$$\ end { document } chi = 0,1l = 321 would be impossible , we were able to go through the dataset manually .
the mechanism dataset was represented by a 248 - by - 323 matrix whose rows were the 248 enzymes , and the first and last columns contained the enzyme names ( the enzyme sequence 's uniprot accession number ) and their associated mechanism class labels , respectively .
the remaining 321 columns denoted the 321 interpro signature features .
we systematically swapped the 321 columns containing the interpro signature features while keeping the rows and the first and last columns of the matrix fixed .
results after a number of iterations , we ended up with a block diagonal version of the original data matrix , see fig. 1. the figure , a heat map of the data matrix , seems to explain why k1nn yielded the excellent classification results [ 1 ] .
in the figure , the abscissa denotes interpro signatures , whereas the vertical axis represents the enzyme sequence 's uniprot accession number and the corresponding macie enzymatic mechanism labels of the form m0123 .
the colour yellow signifies that feature xi ( interpro signature ) is present for the enzyme , while the red colour indicates that feature xi is absent for the enzyme. fig. 1 heatmap of our data matrix .
the horizontal axis denotes interpro signatures , whereas the vertical axis represents the enzyme sequence 's uniprot accession number and the corresponding macie enzymatic mechanism labels of the form m0123 .
the yellow colour signifies that feature x i ( interpro signature ) is present for the enzyme , while the red colour indicates that x i is absent for this enzyme .
enzymes that possess the same macie mechanism label reside in a subspace of the feature space chi , which barely overlaps with other subspaces associated with other mechanisms .
the inset depicts the heatmap for the dataset matrix corresponding to the interpro signatures and names of enzymes with the macie enzymatic mechanism label m0218 according to fig. 1 , the 321 interpro signatures are highly discriminating features .
enzymes that possess the same enzymatic mechanism \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ omega _{ j }$$\ end { document } omegaj reside in a subspace ( region ) in \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ chi = \ left \{ { 0,1 } \ right \}^{ l = 321 }$$\ end { document } chi = 0,1l = 321 which barely overlaps with neighbouring regions .
the inset in fig. 1 depicts the heatmap of the portion of the dataset that corresponds to the enzymes ( and their interpro signature features ) that have macie enzymatic mechanism label m0218 , i.e. \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ omega _{ j } = m0218 $$\ end { document } omegaj = m0218 .
note that a subspace for a given mechanism can be a composite ( union ) of non - overlapping " sub - subspaces " .
the sharing of the m0218 label by two separate non - homologous sequences illustrates the presence of two distinct proteins , firstly pancreatic lipase and secondly colipase , in the reactive complex .
out of our 71 regions , only the two regions representing enzymes with macie mechanisms \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ omega _{ j = 30 } = m0348 $$\ end { document } omegaj = 30 = m0348 and \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ omega _{ j = 35 } = m0269 $$\ end { document } omegaj = 35 = m0269 completely overlap .
the same four interpro signature features represent the enzymes that show mechanisms m0348 and m0269 , highlighted in red in table 1 .

the two mechanism labels shown in italics are discussed in the main text we suggest that our block data - matrix could be employed as an enzymatic mechanism prediction tool - - a template against which to match novel enzymes to ascertain their potential enzymatic mechanisms in regard to the 71 mechanisms in the mechanism dataset .
in this work , our mechanism dataset was re - analysed to ascertain as to why a simple but high variance classifier yielded such excellent classification results .
we hope that we have provided a reasonable explanation ; the mechanism dataset matrix is block diagonal in the feature and class spaces .
in other words , the features ( almost ) uniquely codify the chemical mechanism of a given enzyme .
based on these observations , we have also made the suggestion that one might be able to utilise the dataset matrix as an enzymatic mechanism prediction tool .

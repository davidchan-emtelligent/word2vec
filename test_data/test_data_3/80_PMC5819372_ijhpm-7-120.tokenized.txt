http :// ijhpm.com background : the measurement of health benefits is a key issue in health economic evaluations .
there is very scarce empirical literature exploring the differences of using quality - adjusted life years ( qalys ) or disability - adjusted life years ( dalys ) as benefit metrics and their potential impact in decision - making .
methods : two previously published models delivering outputs in qalys , were adapted to estimate dalys : a markov model for human papilloma virus ( hpv ) vaccination , and a pneumococcal vaccination deterministic model ( pneumo ) .
argentina , chile , and the united kingdom studies were used , where local eq - 5d social value weights were available to provide local qaly weights .
a primary study with descriptive vignettes was done ( n = 73 ) to obtain eq - 5d data for all health states included in both models .
several scenario analyses were carried - out to evaluate the relative importance of using different metrics ( dalys or qalys ) to estimate health benefits on these economic evaluations .
results : qaly gains were larger than dalys avoided in all countries for hpv , leading to more favorable decisions using the former. with discounting and age - weighting - scenario with greatest differences in all countries - incremental dalys avoided represented the 75 % , 68 % , and 43 % of the qalys gained in argentina , chile , and united kingdom respectively .
differences using qalys or dalys were less consistent and sometimes in the opposite direction for pneumo .
these differences , similar to other widely used assumptions , could directly influence decision - making using usual gross domestic products ( gdps ) per capita per daly or qaly thresholds .
conclusion : we did not find evidence that contradicts current practice of many researchers and decision - makers of using qalys or dalys interchangeably .
differences attributed to the choice of metric could influence final decisions , but similarly to other frequently used assumptions .

doi : 10.15171 / ijhpm.2017.47 background the measurement of health benefits is a key issue in health economic evaluations and health policy , however the choice of the metric of measurement is not uniformly acknowledged .
traditional cost - benefit measurement , for example , requires that both costs and consequences are measured in terms of monetary value .
whilst the measurement of costs is relatively straightforward , there are differing opinions as to the mechanism for assigning a monetary value to health benefits - and indeed whether such an assignment is acceptable .
for the measurement of health benefit to have the greatest potential use in order to inform allocative efficiency decisions , it needs to be based on a generic system so that gains / losses can be compared across the widest possible range of therapeutic interventions .
in this context , measures of health or health assessment , and specially combined metrics that incorporate life expectancy and quality of life or disability have been widely adopted .
two main different generic paradigms have been proposed for setting healthcare priorities : quality - adjusted life years ( qalys ) based on the effect of interventions , and disability - adjusted life years ( dalys ) based on the burden of disease in a population .
these formal paradigms recall the assumptions implicitly made in the everyday delivering of , and hence rationing access to , healthcare .
nowadays , these two paradigms have emerged as the main contenders in informing national agencies and global decision - makers , although not without controversy and with the availability of other alternative potential metrics.1 due to the scarcity of empirical comparisons of economic evaluations using qalys or dalys , we undertook a comparative exploratory exercise based on recent economic evaluations our group was involved in. in order to have a broad scope , we included economic evaluations based on two models evaluating two vaccines ( human papilloma virus - hpv - and conjugated pneumococcal ) with researchers from the collaborative team .
methods two preventive models were selected in order to empirically address the effect of using daly and qaly - based methods to compute health benefits in economic evaluations : an hpv cohort based markov vaccination model,2 and a pneumococcal compartmental vaccination model.3 both models were developed in microsoft excel ( r ) , and originally used only qalys as the primary health benefit measure , incorporating qaly weights from international sources .
these models have been applied in different countries around the world.2,4,5 for the present study , we analyzed and compared model adaptations from argentina , chile , and the united kingdom because eq - 5d social value weights were available for these countries.6 - 8 this allowed to explore the impact of country - specific utility weights for qalys on results across countries .
in addition , models were reprogrammed in order to estimate both components required to estimate dalys : years of life with disability ( yld ) produced by the same conditions , as well as the years of life lost ( ylls ) by premature death .
see more details about model description in appendix 1 .
human papilloma virus vaccination model the hpv vaccination model is a markov model reflecting the natural history of oncogenic hpv infection , through 12 different health states .
the model follows a cohort of 11 - year old girls over lifetime under two different strategies : current pap screening program or current pap screening program plus bivalent hpv vaccination at 12 years old .
general description of the model and results for argentina , chile , and united kingdom has been published elsewhere.2,5 briefly , the model considers the epidemiology of hpv , the characteristics of the screening program , the treatment guidelines and the specific costs for each country .
in order to model the natural history of oncogenic hpv infection and cancer development , incidences of hpv infection for each country were modeled from local prevalence studies .
for all other state - transition probabilities , as local studies were not available , data from the united kingdom was used for all three countries .
finally , models were calibrated to country specific vital statistics in order to reproduce local epidemiology of hpv related diseases .
pneumococcal vaccination model the pneumococcal vaccination model is static , deterministic and age - compartmental.3 it considers the occurrence of four pneumococcal related diseases ( meningitis , bacteraemia , pneumonia and acute otitis media ) in a calendar year , across all age cohorts .
additionally , present value of future costs and disutilities related to events' sequelae that start in that year are incorporated .
the model is able to address the cost - effectiveness of the introduction of different pneumococcal vaccines ( synflorix ( r ) or prevnar ( r ) as compared to no vaccination ) in local vaccination programs .
in the present study we reprogrammed the model using synflorix ( r ) as an example .
estimating quality - adjusted life years for each health state in both models , descriptive vignettes based on the eq - 5d - 3l instrument were administered to a convenience sample of 73 healthy people in argentina who had completed their high school studies , in order to gather descriptive health state data .
more details of this sub - study were previously published.9 finally , as local social values are available in the three countries analyzed,6 - 8 these country specific eq - 5d weights were used in order to map the same mix of descriptive health states for each health state into local qaly weights .
pneumococcal vaccination model also contemplates including normative utilities by age , that is , the mean utility of spending a year alive for the general population .
normative utilities were obtained from local valuation studies and population surveys of argentina,6,10 chile ( v. zarate v , p. kind , personal communication , 2009 ) 8,11 and the united kingdom.11 in a scenario analysis we explored the impact of using qalys estimated without normative utilities .
calculating disability - adjusted life years by default , both models estimate qalys , so they were reprogrammed in order to include dalys .
to calculate dalys we employed individual equations for yll and yld published elsewhere.12 - 15 a population figure was obtained by multiplying each individual result by the incident cases , deaths or disability cases that were estimated by the models .
additional details about the daly calculations can be found in appendix 2 .
standard expectation of life for yll calculations were extracted from life - table west level 26.14 in an alternative scenario we used local life tables for each country .
disability weights were obtained from the 2004 update of the global burden of disease study12,16 for all the pneumococcal vaccination model states .
disability weights unavailable for the hpv vaccination model ( ie , all states except cancer related states ) , were obtained following the methodology described in a dutch study.15 this study transformed eq - 5d descriptive data to a disability weight using a multiple regression equation .
there was no need to estimate independently disease duration for estimating dalys ( ie , with dismod model ) as they were obtained by the markov models .
models analysis for the analysis , epidemiological parameters ( such as incidence , acute mortality , or transition between different states ) were kept as in the original published studies.2,3 the main difference in the base - case analysis from the original studies were : ( 1 ) that specific eq - 5d values using country specific value sets for health state were included ; and ( 2 ) models have been reprogrammed to estimate dalys alongside qalys based on gbd weights as described .
for both models we selected to report the analysis of the qaly vs. daly using a denominator of 100 000 subjects , though this was not always the denominator in the published studies .
first , we estimated the incremental benefit associated to each of the interventions , using both qalys gained and dalys avoided .
four scenarios to compare qaly with daly results were estimated : with and without a 3.5 % annual discount rate for both qalys and dalys , and with and without age weighting for dalys .
second , in order to compare the relative difference between qalys and dalys in each scenario , a dalys avoided / qalys gained percentage ratio was estimated .
so , a percentage ratio of 100 % means that benefits were exactly the same with both metrics , a percentage ratio greater than 100 % means that dalys avoided were greater than qalys gained , and a percentage ratio lower than 100 % means that qalys gained were greater .
third , we estimated the potential impact on decision - making of using these different metrics .
in order to achieve this , for each model and country , we estimated the maximum incremental costs per person receiving the intervention that would make the strategy be deemed very cost - effective or cost - effective .
though now controversial , for illustration on how a specific decision rule , using either qalys or dalys , could impact the study conclusions , we used the willingness to pay thresholds according to gross domestic product ( gdp ) per capita proposed by the world health organization ( who ). 17 according to this guidance , an intervention is very cost - effective if its incremental cost - effectiveness ratio ( icer ) is less or equal 1 gdp per capita per daly ; cost - effective if it ranges from > 1 and < equal 3 ; and not cost - effective if it is greater than three gdps per capita per daly .
though this rule was originally designed for dalys , more commonly used in lower and middle income country settings , it is often used interchangeably for qalys , used both in developed countries as well as in less developed ones .
gdps for each country were obtained from the international monetary fund and expressed in international dollars 2013,18 which represent a purchasing power adjusted value .
finally , in order to explore some potential factors that may influence these differences , we explored the impact of some model assumptions on several additional scenario analyses ( sensitivity analysis ) .
we explored replacing each countries eq - 5d based qaly weights by " 1 - daly 's disability weight " ; we varied influential parameters in the parent economic evaluation in the case of pneumococcal vaccine - those related to acute otitis media ; used of local life expectancies to estimate dalys ; and incorporated normative ( general population ) utilities to estimate qalys in the hpv vaccination model which were not incorporated in the base - case analyses ; and also tested a scenario where the demographic characteristics of the three countries population was standardized in order to explore whether demographic differences had an impact in the qaly vs. daly differences .
the alternative scenario results are not the focus of the main paper ; interested readers can see appendix 3 .
results human papilloma virus vaccination model table 1 shows qalys gained and dalys avoided comparing hpv vaccination against no intervention in the four base - case scenarios ( with and without discounting of both qalys and dalys ; and with and without dalys age - weighting ) .
in most of the analyses , qalys gains were larger than dalys avoided , which would lead to more favorable decisions regarding cost - effectiveness if qalys were used as the benefit metric .
differences were larger in the united kingdom and smaller in argentina .
the incorporation of discounting and dalys age weighting affected most markedly the estimation of dalys , increasing the difference with qalys in all countries , where incremental dalys avoided represented 75 % , 68 % , and 43 % of the qalys gained in argentina , chile , and the united kingdom respectively .
on the other hand , differences were smaller , and within +/ - 20 % range when no discounting nor age weighting were used .
in order to depict how these differences in the magnitude of benefit estimation if using qalys or dalys could have influenced decision - making , we show in figure 1 how a new intervention with a particular incremental cost would change the decision based on qalys or dalys , and using the 1 and 3 gdp thresholds for qalys or dalys in the four scenarios and the three countries .

abbreviations : qalys , quality - adjusted life years ; dalys , disability - adjusted life years ; gdp , gross domestic product ; hpv , human papilloma virus .
for instance , in the united kingdom ( with discounting and no age weights ) as qaly estimation results in more benefits , an incremental cost per vaccinated person up to $ 2036 would be considered cost - effective using a 3 gdp threshold ; while the same intervention would be considered cost - effective using dalys only if the incremental cost per person is $ 1124 or less .
this is another way of reflecting the 55 % percentage ratio shown in table 1 for this scenario .
in this case example , decisions were more likely to agree if discounting and age weighting are used , but this can depend on the value of the final incremental cost of the study , and thus the incremental cost - effectiveness ratio for each country in relation to the decision threshold .

a main scenarios for basal analysis ( with and without discounting ; with or without daly age - weighting ) .
pneumococcal vaccination model differences in incremental benefits using qalys gained or dalys saved show a different picture than in the hpv case study .
in this case qalys and dalys gains were similar , and sometimes greater using dalys , which would either not affect the decision or lead to more favourable decisions if dalys were used as the benefit metric .
table 2 shows incremental benefits in each country and scenario .
differences usually decreased when using discounting and no age weighting .
unlike the hpv case , in which differences were consistently larger in the united kingdom and smaller in argentina , there was no uniform pattern for all scenarios .
differences were larger in argentina in those scenarios with age weighting , and larger in the united kingdom in those scenarios without age weighting .

a main scenarios for basal analysis ( with and without discounting ; with or without daly age - weighting ) .
as an example , in the united kingdom , qaly - daly differences showed by the daly / qaly percentage ratio were lower when age weighting was used in order to estimate dalys avoided ( difference ranged from - 0.45 % - percentage ratio 99.55 % - [ with discount and age weighting ] to + 34.85 % [ with age weighting and no discount ]) .
the influence of these differences between qalys and dalys in decision - making was smaller than in the hpv case and is shown in figure 2 .

abbreviations : qalys , quality - adjusted life years ; dalys , disability - adjusted life years ; gdp , gross domestic product ; hpv , human papilloma virus .
similarly to figure 1 , figure 2 depicts the mean incremental cost of the strategy at which the decision would change .
differences were rather small ( within 5 %) in the scenario with discounting and age weighting in all countries .
in other scenarios , they were within +/ - 20 % , except in the united kingdom , where in the scenarios without age weighting dalys were about 30 % higher than qalys .
as an example , comparing conjugated pneumococcal vaccine strategy to no vaccination in argentina ( scenario without discounting and with age weighting ) an incremental cost of the intervention of $ 8.5 would make the intervention cost - effective if dalys are used , but cost - ineffective if qalys are used instead .
in order to contextualize the findings and gauge the relevance of the benefit metric used versus other related choices researchers have when performing economic evaluations , we evaluated how , with each methodological choice , always compared to a common strategy - a scenario with discounted qalys and normative utilities - the benefits can change .
a summary of the influence of the different choices for both disease cases is shown in table 3 , where we show , for each of the researchers potential structural / methodological choices ( columns ) how much the baseline benefit differences between qalys and dalys change .
table 3 impact of scenario choice on the estimation of the magnitude of benefit difference , expressed as the proportion of increase or decrease from a comparator scenario of using qalys with normative utilities and discounting of both qalys and dalys dalys ( no age weighting ) dalys ( with age weighting ) qalys ( no discount ) qalys ( non - normative utilities ) 1 - daly 's disability weight hpv argentina 20 % 3 % 341 % 31 % 7 % chile 15 % - 1 % 394 % 38 % - 5 % uk - 25 % - 48 % 439 % 56 % 0 % pneumococcal argentina - 1.1 % 4.4 % 139.0 % 6.0 % - 8.1 % chile 3.9 % - 0.2 % 122.6 % 13.4 % - 13.2 % uk 24.0 % - 0.3 % 47.6 % 17.9 % - 5.0 % abbreviations : qalys , quality - adjusted life years ; daly , disability - adjusted life year ; gdp , gross domestic product ; hpv , human papilloma virus .
as we can see , some of the assumptions can influence the results similarly or more than the choice of qalys or dalys as the benefit metric .
the largest differences were seen comparing to undiscounted results , which is not a practice currently recommended .
in the case of hpv , the inclusion or exclusion of normative utilities was one of the most influential parameters , even more influential than the choice of the benefit metric ( daly or qaly ) .
in the case of pneumococcal disease , methodological choices showed the impact of discounting , and a lower impact of not using normative utilities .
the other choices ( dalys with or without age weight , or using 1 - daly 's disability weight ) had an inconsistent and heterogeneous influence in the differences .
more details about the results for the alternative analyses can be seen in appendix 3 .
discussion there is no widespread agreement about the choice of the measure of health assessment in health economic evaluations , and there is also no consensus on using or not combined metrics - such as qalys or dalys .
germany , for example , favors natural units ( ie , mm hg for blood pressure reduction ) instead of using a combined metric that tries to incorporate healthy life and thus morbidity and mortality.19 at the global level , key players such as the who promotes the use of the dalys , mainly intended for evaluating and comparing disease burden across countries.16 in most jurisdictions where guidelines for economic evaluations are in place , qaly are usually preferred , though there is no consensus or empirical recommendations about whether one metric should be chosen over another.20,21 we can conceptualize this problem as one of structural uncertainty ; ie , the assumptions that we incorporate into the decision problem , and whether these assumptions influence results and decision - making .
this is only one component of global uncertainty , which also includes parameter uncertainty and heterogeneity.22 in the context of almost no literature empirically addressing this issue , we performed an exploratory case study analysis using two different models , that had been used in real studies , in order to address whether using qaly gained or daly avoided to estimate incremental health benefits could affect the final estimation of benefit impact , and consequently the cost - effectiveness estimation and the coverage decision when adopting widely used decision rules related to the per capita gdp per unit of benefit.17 in these two case studies , we did not find a systematic pattern regarding the magnitude and direction of the differences between dalys and qalys .
these differences were greater in the hpv case , and usually significantly smaller in the case of pneumococcal vaccine .
we found that the decisional impact was higher in the hpv than in the pneumococcal case ; and results were sensitive to discounting as well as age weighting of dalys .
though the latter is no longer recommended for dalys estimation for disease burden , discounting is a standard practice in economic evaluation.23 - 27 nevertheless , the magnitude of the structural uncertainty due to the metric choice was not necessarily greater than that due to other assumptions tested , usually based on explicit value choices and defended on normative or technical grounds .
this was especially true in the case of incorporating normative utilities , which significantly influence the amount of qalys gained , and thus the differences between qalys and dalys .
the results obtained using normative utilities to calculate qaly gains were significantly lower than using a utility of 1 for the general population .
one possible explanation for the differences observed between the case studies analyzed ( hpv model vs. pneumococcal model ) is that the pneumococcal model incorporates normative utilities in order to estimate qaly gains in people without pneumococcal disease ( therefore qaly gains are lower than if a utility = 1 is assumed for this healthy people ) .
since normative utilities are not considered in the hpv model in order to estimate qalys gained , differences using both metrics could be higher than those observed in the main analysis .
many studies evaluate and criticize the guiding principles of dalys or qalys , the influence of value choices , methodology , usefulness for developing countries , or arguments for their standardization .
nevertheless , we found no empirical studies that posed our study question .
one study in the tuberculosis field discusses the pros and cons of using dalys or qalys but makes no empirical comparison between the methods.28 airoldi and morton29 published a conceptual paper comparing the potential benefit of a healthcare intervention measured in terms of qalys vs. dalys .
there are many differences with our work , and is thus difficult to extrapolate findings between the two .
they isolate the effect of framing the problem from a health or a disability perspective ; did not use age - weighting function in calculating dalys , employed a common discounting methodology and the same set of quality of life and disability weights .
they found that the main difference between these measures is the use of life expectancy tables to determine the years of life lost component of dalys .
particularly , the use of a death - dependent reference age is problematic when the intention is to evaluate the impact of life saving interventions .
in these cases , some authors recommended the use of local period life expectancy tables for single - year interventions ' as long as the changes caused by the intervention do not change age - specific and overall life expectancies substantially. ' 30 using our results for the hpv vaccination model showed that dalys avoided were generally less than qalys gained ; just as airoldi and morton would predict for a life extending intervention .
on the other hand , with the model that evaluated the introduction of conjugated pneumococcal vaccination , another life extending intervention , we found the opposite ; that is , dalys avoided were generally more than qalys gained .
some limitations of our study should be noted .
results obtained from this exploratory study are difficult to extrapolate to other studies .
we evaluated only two preventive interventions .
as a case study , it was built on adapting previously used models , and not intended to generalize the findings to wider contexts .
also , there has been a recent update of disability weights for dalys.16 though the agreement between the newer and older disability weights set was high ( r = 0.70 ) and would not probably alter significantly our results , this is an issue worth exploring in future studies .
conclusion our study , which adapted two previously published models to report health benefits both in qalys and dalys , shows that the magnitude of benefit could be significantly different when using one or the other , and these differences did not systematically favoured one metric vs. the other .
the magnitude of this source of uncertainty was similar to that of other sources of uncertainty that could lead to different decisions about the cost - effectiveness of a health technology .
as an empirical methodological case study , we consider it more as hypothesis generating that an explanatory study .
we did not find evidence that contradicts current practice of many researchers and decision - makers of using and interpreting results of qaly or daly based studies interchangeably and thus with the same decision - making threshold .
a more generalizable analysis using specifically designed models could be necessary in order to be able to better understand the factors that explain the differences of using each metric .

this paper shows that the magnitude of health benefit estimated through qalys or dalys could be significantly different and potentially alter the study conclusions .
the magnitude of the uncertainty associated to the choice of metric was not greater to other common sources of uncertainty in economic evaluations ( ie , discounting , parameter or structural uncertainty ) .
implications for public in this paper we show that the choice of the measure of health benefit ( quality - adjusted life years [ qalys ] or disability - adjusted life years [ dalys ]) can potentially alter the results and conclusions of an economic evaluation to determine the cost - effectiveness of a health technology .
this finding , together with other sources of uncertainty should be taken into account when designing , performing or reporting this type of studies .

appendix 2 appendix 2 .
dalys estimation methods both models were reprogrammed in order to estimate dalys .
for calculating dalys we followed a standard methodology described to estimate both ylds and ylls.14 for ylds , we used the following equation : yld = d *(( k * c * er * a ( r + beta ) 2 )*( e - ( r + beta )*( l + a )*( - ( r + beta )*( l + a ) - 1 ) - e ( r + beta )* a *(( - ( r + beta )* a - 1 ))+( 1 - kr )*( 1 - e - r * l )) where k = age weighting modulation factor ( between 0 and 1 ) ; c = constant ( 0.1658 ) ; r = discount rate ; a = age of onset of disability ; beta = parameter of the age weighting function ( 0.04 ) ; l = duration of disability ; d = disability weight .
a correction of this equation has to be made in order to prevent error when r = 0 : yld = d *(( k * c * ebeta * abeta2 )*( e - beta * l *( - beta )*( l + a ) - 1 ) - ( - beta * a - 1 ))+( 1 - k )* l ) for ylls , we used the following equation : yll = ( k * c * er * a ( r + beta ) 2 )*( e - ( r + beta )*( le + a )*( - ( r + beta )*( le + a ) - 1 ) - e - ( r + beta )* a *( - ( r + beta )* a - 1 ))+( 1 - kr )*( 1 - e - r * le ) where k = age weighting modulation factor ( between 0 and 1 ) ; c = constant ( 0.1658 ) ; r = discount rate ; a = age of death ; beta = parameter of the age weighting function ( 0.04 ) ; le = standard expectation of life at age a. a correction of this equation has to be made in order to prevent error when r = 0 : yll = ( k * c * ebeta * abeta2 )*( e - beta * le *( - beta *( le + a ) - 1 ) - ( - beta * a - 1 ))+( 1 - k )* le in all cases , a beta value of 0.04 was used , according to fox - rushby.14 k and r values can be set as independent parameters in models .
two parameters are especially important in order to estimate ylds : duration of the condition , and disability weight associated .
for the hpv vaccination model , duration of each health state by age of onset for women with different participation on screening program ( regular , irregular or no participation ) was measured from the same in order to not include systematic differences with qalys estimation .
for dalys estimations , mean duration data was linked with the estimation cells , so this information is automatically taken from the performance of the model and was not considered as an input .
for the pneumococcal vaccination model duration of conditions that last less of 1 year was considered the same that the duration in the model , and were obtained from the health economic evaluation for the united kingdom .
in the other hand , conditions that last more than 1 year ( auditive and neurologic sequelae ) are assumed not to increase the probability of death and not to be reversible .
so duration is equal to life expectancy ( in each country ) at age of onset ( same assumption that in the health economic evaluation for the united kingdom ) .
the same assumption was used on qaly estimation .
standard methodology for dalys estimation requires using the same disability weight for each country .
the gbod project covers a wider range of conditions , and disability weights ( 2004 ) provided has been widely used.13 as some of the weights are not included in the gbod project , disability weights for stages of the hpv vaccination model were obtained using the same methodology described in the dutch study , involving the estimation of weights for 175 disease stages , sequelae and severity levels .
this method allows to estimate disability weights from eq - 5d descriptive states by mean of a regression model.16 eq5d descriptive states were obtained from the survey mentioned previously and already published.9 appendix 3 appendix 3 .
analyses of alternative scenarios in order to address the potential influence of local eq - 5d social values / tariffs in the base case differences we replaced the values for each country and using 1 - disability weight from gbd project as the quality of life weight .
in that way we used a same coefficient in all countries in order to estimate qalys gained , which is the complementary value of disability weights used for dalys estimation .
this change has a different effect on incremental utility differences using qalys gained and dalys avoided : an increase on daly / qaly percentage ratio of about 6 % in argentina , a decrease between 3 % and 5 % ( without and with discount respectively ) in chile , and a negligible change in the united kingdom .
this makes more similar the differences observed in argentina and chile , meaning that differences between these countries could be explained at least in part by using different eq - 5d tariffs .
table a4 shows the new qalys gained and dalys avoided estimations and figure a4 shows the effect on threshold analysis which was of the same magnitude as mentioned previously .
differences between qalys gained and dalys avoided were again lower when no discount ( in both qalys and dalys estimations ) and no age weighting ( in dalys estimation ) were applied .

this change decreased the expected qalys gained , increasing daly / qaly percentage ratio in all countries ( see table a5 ) .
this was translated in change in most of the cases , with thresholds analysis estimation for dalys higher than threshold analysis estimations for qalys ( see figure a5 ) .

pneumococcal vaccine additional scenarios similarly to the hpv model , different alternative scenarios were evaluated ( eq - 5d weights replaced by 1 - disability weight , in the alternative analysis in order to reduce between countries variability in qalys gained estimations .
new qalys gained estimations produced a difference in the daly / qaly percentage ratio in a range of - 1 % to + 16 % comparing against the base cases analysis .
table a6 shows new estimations using 1 - disability weights as eq - 5d qaly weights .
since these changes were small , lower differences on threshold analysis using both qalys gained and dalys avoided for chile and uk were still found when 3.5 % discount rate and age weighting were used ( see figure a6 ) .
for argentina , the lowest difference was found when 3.5 % discount rate without age weighting analysis was performed .

several alternative analyses were carried - out : excluding normative utilities from all models , using local life expectancies to dalys estimations , using a same population structure and excluding herd protection from the analysis .
as expected in the alternative analysis using normative utilities , qalys gained increased , reducing the daly / qaly percentage ratio in all countries ( see table a7 ) .
using of local life expectancies in each country produced a dalys avoided estimations reduction between - 8 % to - 1 % ( see table a8 ) .
using the same population structure to the other countries produced a change on daly / qaly percentage ratio ranged from - 1 % to + 11 % ( see table a9 ) .
finally , the without herd immunity analysis produced the bigger differences between countries related to changes on the daly / qaly percentage ratio .
meanwhile negligible changes were observed for argentina , daly / qaly percentage ratio was reduced for more than 50 % in some cases for uk ( see table a9 ) .
as exclusion of herd immunity of models reduced the effect of vaccination only to less of 10 years old populations , age range used for economic evaluations could explain ( at least in part ) differences between dalys and qalys .
decision impact analyses for these alternative scenarios are shown in the appendix , figures a7 to a12 .

changes in qalys gained and dalys avoided estimations , as well as daly / qaly percentage ratio and threshold analyses were negligible ( lower of 1 % for all countries ) , as compared against the base case analysis ( see tables a10 and a11 ) .

abstract we present here the first complete genomic sequence of arracacha virus a from a peruvian arracacha sample collected in 1975 and compare it with the genomes of other nepoviruses .
its rna1 and rna2 both had greatest amino acid identities with those of the subgroup a nepovirus melon mild mottle virus .
department for environment , food and rural affairs ( defra ) https :// doi.org / 10.13039 / 501100000277roger jonescover - datemay 2017 genome announcement in 1975 , during a virus survey of subsistence plantings containing crop mixtures at umari , huanuco department , in the peruvian andes , a virus was isolated from arracacha plants [ peruvian parsnip ( arracaccia xanthorhiza ) , family apiaceae ] showing pronounced leaf mosaic symptoms .
the virus was mechanically transmissible to 38 species from 10 plant families .
following characterization using electron microscopy , density centrifugation , and serology , it was identified as a member of the nepovirus genus and named arracacha virus a ( ava ) ( 1 , 2 ) .
in 1978 , ava - infected leaf samples were dried over calcium chloride in peru , sealed in glass vials , and sent to the united kingdom .
they currently form part of what is now called the fera plant virus collection .
in 2015 , total rna was extracted from the freeze - dried ava - infected leaf material using an rneasy kit ( qiagen , united kingdom ) , including the optional dnase treatment .
an indexed plant ribosome - subtracted sequencing library was then produced from the total rna using the scriptseq complete plant leaf kit ( illumina , usa ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the indexed library was then sequenced along with others on a miseq instrument ( illumina ) , using a 600 - cycle v3 kit .
the resulting 492,656 paired reads were trimmed on the 3 ' end to a quality score of 20 using sickle ( 3 ) , assembled using trinity ( 4 ) , and the resulting contigs compared to the genbank nr and nt databases using blast + ( 5 ) .
reads of viral origin were extracted using megann ( 6 ) .
two contigs of 7,411 and 3,852 nucleotides ( nt ) in length were assembled and shown by similarity to other nepoviruses to represent the rna1 and rna2 components of the ava genome , respectively .
the ava rna1 encoded a putative 266 - kda polyprotein with an amino acid identity resembling those of the subgroup a nepoviruses melon mild mottle virus ( 39 %) ( 7 ) and grapevine fanleaf virus ( 36 %) ( 8 ) .
the ava rna2 encoded a putative 127 - kda polyprotein with 32 % and 30 % amino acid identities to melon mild mottle virus and potato black ringspot virus ( 9 ) , another subgroup a nepovirus , respectively .
these findings , along with the absence of any significant homology between the 3 ' untranslated regions ( utrs ) of the rna1 and rna2 molecules confirm that ava belongs to subgroup a of the nepovirus genus .
accession number ( s ) .
the sequences were deposited in genbank under accession numbers ky569301 ( rna1 ) and ky569302 ( rna2 ) .

the study is aimed at i ) optimization of techniques for preparing microcapsules ; ii ) generation of multicellular tumor spheroids ( mts ) by culturing tumor cells in the microcapsules ; iii ) study of anticancer treatment effects for both photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) and anti - cancer drug screening .
the model allows to estimate drug doses or parameters for pdt in vitro before carrying out preclinical tests , and thereby to reduce a number and costs of experiments with animals commonly used .
materials and methods to form mts , tumor cell lines ( mouse melanoma cells m3 , human breast adenocarcinoma cells mcf - 7 , mouse myeloma sp2 / 0 cells , human ccrf - cem and cem / cl cell lines , hela ) were encapsulated in polyelectrolyte microcapsules ( 200 - 600 mum ) , and cultivated for 3 - 4 weeks [ 1 ] .
microcapsules were fabricated from alginate ( polyanion ) and various polycations , namely natural polymers ( modified chitosan , deae - dextran etc ) and novel smart co - polymers ( e.g. chitosan - graft - polyvinyl alcohol copolymers ) synthesized by a solid - state reactive blending technique [ 2 ] .
the copolymers were characterized by ftir , gpc and elemental analysis .
results mts based mcf - 7 cells were prepared and used to study effects of pdt .
to study the effect of irradiation parameters on cell viability , 2 photosensitizers ( ps ) , namely photosense and chlorine e6 were used .
phototoxicity of ps depended on ps concentration and light energy density in both monolayer culture ( mlc ) and mts .
study of cell morphology in mlc and mts before and after pdt revealed that light energy density increase within the range of 30 - 70 j / cm2 resulted in cell apoptosis .
however , cell survival in mts was much higher than this in the mlc .
mts were also used to test some antitumor therapeutics ( methotrexate , doxorubicin and their derivatives ) .
an enhanced cell resistance in mts compared to mlc both for normal and dox - resistant cells ( mcf - 7 , mcf - 7 / dxr , respectively ) were observed .
mts were also proposed to evaluate cytotoxicity not only of novel therapeutics but also nanosized drug delivery systems ( liposomes , micelles , nanoparticles and nanoemulsions ) .

background determining the presence and extent of co - morbidities is fundamental in assessing patients with chronic respiratory disease , where increased cardiovascular risk , presence of osteoporosis and low muscle mass have been recognised in several disease states .
we hypothesised that the systemic consequences are evident in a further group of subjects with copd due to alpha - 1 antitrypsin deficiency ( a1atd ) , yet are currently under - recognised .
methods we studied 19 patients with pizz a1atd copd and 20 age , sex and smoking matched controls , all subjects free from known cardiovascular disease .
they underwent spirometry , haemodynamic measurements including aortic pulse wave velocity ( apwv ) , an independent predictor or cardiovascular risk , dual energy x - ray absorptiometry to determine body composition and bone mineral density .
results the apwv was greater in patients : 9.9 ( 2.1 ) m / s than controls : 8.5 ( 1.6 ) m / s , p = 0.03 , despite similar mean arterial pressure ( map ) .
the strongest predictors of apwv were age , fev1 % predicted and map ( all p < 0.01 ) .
osteoporosis was present in 8 / 19 patients ( 2 / 20 controls ) and was previously unsuspected in 7 patients .
the fat free mass and bone mineral density were lower in patients than controls ( p < 0.001 ) .
conclusions patients with a1atd related copd have increased aortic stiffness suggesting increased risk of cardiovascular disease and evidence of occult musculoskeletal changes , all likely to contribute hugely to overall morbidity and mortality .
background the systemic manifestations in chronic respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) can be multiple and include a persistent systemic inflammatory state , excess cardiovascular disease , bone thinning and low skeletal muscle mass ; each associated with considerable morbidity and mortality [ 1 - 3 ] .
alpha - 1 antitrypsin deficiency ( a1atd ) is an established genetic risk factor estimated to occur in 1 - 2 % of patients with copd , though generally under - recognised and the co - morbidities in this condition have not explored [ 4 ] .
characterisation of the genetic and proteonomic basis of the a1atd status has supported the protease - antiprotease theory of lung injury , as abnormally low levels of alpha - 1 antitrypsin ( a1at ) leads to unopposed protease activity and destruction of the elastin matrix within the lung , resulting in emphysema .
in usual copd , the emphysematous extent has been related to the cardiovascular and bone alterations [ 5,6 ] .
in addition to its presence in the lungs , circulating a1at also binds to the endothelium [ 7 ] , has a protective role in limiting vascular damage and is involved in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cells and control of inflammatory pathways [ 8,9 ] .
low levels of a1at , leading to unopposed neutrophil elastase activity in the vasculature may result in the local degradation of elastin , with a resultant increased collagen deposition .
in the larger central arteries , the elastin : collagen balance is an important structural contribution in determining arterial stiffness , which is implicated in arteriosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular risk [ 10,11 ] .
the current literature on cardiovascular risk in the pizz a1atd is conflicting , largely due to small sized studies or sub - analysis of this homozygous state in larger studies [ 12 - 14 ] .
previously , we have demonstrated increased aortic stiffness , low bone mineral density ( bmd ) and low skeletal muscle mass in the presence of a heightened circulating inflammatory state in patients with usual copd [ 15,16 ] .
we hypothesised that these cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systemic co - morbidities would be present in the chronic respiratory disease a1atd and hence need to be identified .
materials and methods study subjects adult patients with pizz a1atd and confirmed airways obstruction or ct proven emphysema on the adapt ( antitrypsin deficiency assessment and programme for treatment ) register residing within a 1.5 hour commutable distance of the cardiff study centre , together with patients from respiratory out - patients clinics were invited .
patients were studied when clinically stable [ 15 ] .
sedentary control subjects , matched for age , sex , smoking and additionally free of respiratory disease were also recruited from the same region .
exclusion criteria for all subjects included malignancy , rheumatoid disease , diabetes mellitus , maintenance oral corticosteroids , active infection or other chronic inflammatory disease , weight losing drugs , known congestive heart failure , documented history of cardiovascular disease , solid organ transplantation , parallel participation in interventional study , pregnancy or breastfeeding .
all subjects gave written , informed consent and the study had south west wales research ethics committee approval ( 08 / wmw02 / 48 ) .
anthropometry , lung function and physical function height and weight ( seca , germany ) were determined barefoot and in lightweight indoor clothing and the body mass index ( bmi ) calculated .
a low bmi was defined as < 20 kg / m2 [ 15 ] .
all subjects performed spirometry : forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( fev1 ) , forced vital capacity ( fvc ) , and fev1 / fvc ratio , ( vitalograph ltd , bucks uk ) having withheld short - and long - acting bronchodilators for six and twelve hours respectively .
subjects underwent a six minute walk test ( 6mwd ) after all other assessments had been performed [ 17 ] .
all patients completed a st george respiratory questionnaire ( sgrq ) and all subjects completed a physical activity questionnaire relating to their last month 's activity [ 18,19 ] .
contemporaneous room air arterialised ear lobe gases were determined in the patients .
recent ( within 12 months ) post bronchodilator lung volumes and gas transfer data were obtained from patients' medical notes and , if not , were performed ( n = 3 ) .
cardiovascular measurements subjects were studied after an overnight fast and 6 hours after abstinence from caffeine , tobacco , and inhaled short - acting beta2 agonists and 12 hours following long - acting beta2 agonists , to ensure haemodynamic measures were made free of the acute effect of these agents [ 16 ] .
all tests were performed after ten minutes of supine rest .
peripheral blood pressure ( bp ) was measured in the dominant arm ( omron corporation , japan ) .
radial artery waveforms were recorded via a high fidelity micro manometer ( millar instruments , texas ) .
pulse wave analysis ( syphgmocor , atcor medical , australia ) was subsequently used to derive a heart rate adjusted augmentation index ( aix - 75 ) .
aortic ( carotid - femoral ) pulse wave velocity ( apwv ) was measured as previously described [ 10,16 ] .
traces were assessed by an independent reviewer , blinded to the subject status .
dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dxa ) whole body composition and bmd at the lumbar spine and hip ( and 3 hip subregions ) were determined , within 3 weeks of the main study visit , using hologic discovery ( hologic , ma )[ 15 ] .
the ffm , indicative of skeletal muscle mass was expressed as a height squared ratio to give an index : ffmi .
a low ffmi was defined as < lower 5th percentile for controls [ 15 ] .
upper limb ( both ) , lower limb ( both ) and trunk ffmi were calculated using anatomical markers [ 20 ] .
osteoporosis was defined as t score less than - 2.5 and osteopenia as t score less than - 1 but greater than - 2.5 [ 21 ] .
biochemistry , bone markers and inflammatory mediators an early morning , fasted venous blood sample was collected .
testosterone ( men only ) , thyroid function tests ( tft 's ) , parathyroid hormone ( pth ) and insulin were measured using immunoassay ( advia centaur ) .
25 - hydroxy ( oh ) - vitamin d was measured using direct competitive luminescence ( diasorin liason ) .
corrected calcium , creatinine , fasting glucose and lipids ( cholesterol , high density lipoprotein [ hdl ] , low density lipoprotein [ ldl ] and triglycerides ) were measured using two site immunoassay ( abbot diagnostics , berkshire ) .
il - 6 was measured using quantikine immunoassay ( r & d systems inc , mn , usa ) , as previously reported [ 15 ] .
data analysis data analysis was performed using the statistical package for the social sciences ( spss , chicago , il ) , version 12.0 .
log10 transformation was used where data was not normally distributed .
results are presented as arithmetic or geometric mean and standard deviation ( sd ) .
analyses included chi2 test , independent t test , pearson 's correlations , one - way analysis of variance with post hoc tukey analysis , and stepwise multiple regression analysis .
a p < 0.05 was considered significant .
sample size was based on our primary outcome of apwv , using data for patients with copd .
18 patients were required per group in order to detect a 15 % difference in apwv between groups , with a sd of 2 m / s , a significance of 0.05 and a power of 0.8 .
results subjects of the total 49 patients with pizz a1atd approached , 23 agreed to be contacted and fulfilled the initial screen of suitability , but three were subsequently excluded after further discussion : due to known ischaemic heart disease ( n = 2 ) and active hepatitis c infection ( n = 1 ). of the 20 patients recruited , one developed chest pains necessitating investigation prior to study commencement and he was excluded .
thus , 19 a1atd patients and 20 controls were studied .
patients and controls were similar in terms of age , sex , height and smoking pack year history , ( table 1 ). of the patients , four had never smoked and five smoked less than 10 pack years and one was a current smoker. of the control subjects , three had never smoked and eight smoked less than ten pack years and two were current smokers .

inhaled anticholinergics were prescribed to 16 patients .
three patients had a prior diagnosis of osteoporosis and were receiving bisphosphonate therapy .
there were four patients and three controls with a prior diagnosis of hypertension .
three patients and three controls had a prior history of hypercholesterolaemia .
the median ( range ) alpha 1 antitrypsin levels in patients was 3.1 ( 1.7 - 8.6 ) mumol / l pulmonary and physical function tests as expected , the patients had a lower fev1 , fvc and a shorter 6mwd than the controls , ( p < 0.001 ) , ( table 1 ) .
two patients had a resting pao2 on room air < 7.3 kpa .
cardiovascular data there was no difference in heart rate , peripheral or central systolic , diastolic bp or mean arterial pressure ( map ) between patients and controls , table 2 .
mean ( sd ) apwv was greater in patients : 9.9 ( 2.2 ) m / s than controls : 8.5 ( 1.6 ) m / s , p = 0.03 ) .
aix - 75 was not different , p = 0.33 , ( table 2 ) .
the apwv was greater in males than females overall , p < 0.001 as well as in each group .
we found increased apwv in patients with a1atd compared to controls by at least 0.7 m / s ( and upto 1.8 m / s ) for each decade in the overlapping age range , however small numbers per group preclude formal analysis to determine significance .
in all subjects , apwv was associated with age ( r = 0.56 , p < 0.001 ) and log10il - 6 ( r = 0.50 , p = 0.001 ) and was inversely related to fev1 % predicted ( r = - 0.43 , p = 0.006 ) , fvc % predicted ( r = - 0.42 , p = 0.007 ) and physical activity scores ( r = - 0.36 , p = 0.02 ) .

body composition the mean bmi was lower in patients than controls ( p = 0.001 ) ( table 1 ) , and 2 patients had a pathologically low bmi ( no controls ) .
the 2 patients with a low bmi also had low ffmi and 6 other patients had a low ffmi with normal bmi , indicating hidden ffm loss .
the ffmi was globally lower including upper limbs ( p = 0.01 ) , lower limbs ( p < 0.001 ) and trunk ( p = 0.001 ) of patients compared to controls .
in the whole study population , ffmi was related to fev1 % predicted ( r = 0.40 , p = 0.01 ) and 6mwd ( r = 0.46 , p = 0.003 ) .
bone mineral density and osteoporosis the bmd at the total hip site , all three hip sub - regions and the lumbar spine were all less in the patients than controls ( p < 0.001 ) , ( table 3 ) .
in all subjects , fev1 % predicted was related to total hip bmd ( r = 0.60 , p < 0.001 ) and lumbar spine ( r = 0.55 , p < 0.001 ) .
similarly , ffmi was related to the total hip bmd ( r = 0.67 , p < 0.001 ) and lumbar bmd ( r = 0.61 , p < 0.001 ) .
table 3 subject bone mineral density and profile controln = 20 patientn = 19 p value bmd hip ( g / cm2 ) 1.03 ( 0.20 ) 0.79 ( 0.12 ) < 0.001 bmd lumbar spine ( g / cm2 ) 1.12 ( 0.20 ) 0.88 ( 0.13 ) < 0.001 pth ( pmol / l ) 5.26 ( 1.88 ) 5.53 ( 2.00 ) 0.67 25 - oh vitamin d ( mug / l ) 18.0 ( 8.6 ) 19.5 ( 9.0 ) 0.62 all data represented as mean ( standard deviation ) unless otherwise indicated # geometric mean abbreviations bmd bone mineral density , pth parathyroid hormone 25 - oh 25 hydroxy multiple regression analyses with total bmd at either the lumbar spine or hip as the dependent variables and age , sex , fev1 % predicted , ffmi as independent variables were performed .
at both the hip and the lumbar spine , ffmi , ( adjusted r2 = 0.43 , p < 0.001 and r2 = 0.35 , p < 0.001 respectively ) was the only predictive variable .
there were eight patients and two controls with a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis at either site .
seven of the eight patients and both the controls were new diagnoses of osteoporosis and not previously clinically suspected , necessitating initiation of therapy .
two further patients on prior bisphosphonate therapy were no longer classified as osteoporotic on dxa scan , although still osteopenic .
in total , there were 8 a1atd patients and 4 controls who were osteopenic .
there was no difference in ffmi , fev1 % predicted , 6mwd and apwv between those patients with osteoporosis or not .
biochemistry and systemic inflammation in order to determine other factors that might influence osteoporosis , we explored tft 's , testosterone , 25 - oh vitamin d and pth levels .
no subject had abnormal tft 's and no male subject had low early morning testosterone levels (< 8.0 nmol / l ) , ( table 4 ) .

elevated pth levels ( all with normal calcium and creatinine levels ) were recorded in 9 patients and 10 of the controls. of these , elevated pth levels in conjunction with low 25 - oh vitamin d levels but normal calcium levels were seen in five patients and eight controls .
all patients with a1atd had normal liver function tests .
there were 7 patients and 7 controls with total fasting cholesterol > 6.2 mmol / l , and one patient had an impaired fasting glucose of > 6.0 mmol / l. circulating il - 6 was greater in patients : ( 3.24 ( 1.62 ) than controls : 2.18 ( 1.62 ) pg / ml , p = 0.016 ) .
discussion this study demonstrates , for the first time , that patients with copd due to alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency have increased aortic stiffness , as determined by apwv , compared to age and sex matched controls despite a similar risk profile including blood pressure , fasting lipids , glucose and a comparatively low smoking pack year exposure .
this indicates increased cardiovascular risk in this group of subjects with a1atd with established chronic lung disease that would not have been detected on standard peripheral sphygmomanometry .
in addition , patients with a1atd had lower bmd than matched controls with a significant proportion having a new diagnosis of osteoporosis despite none receiving maintenance oral corticosteroids .
patients had lower bmi and ffmi than controls with nearly half the patient group having skeletal muscle mass loss [ 15 ] .
the study has highlighted a number of potential mechanisms for these changes .
as in usual copd where systemic manifestations have been explored in more detail , it is possible that the heightened systemic inflammatory state , physical inactivity and impaired muscle function may have a role in the development of the systemic manifestations [ 15,16 ] .
however , in addition , the systemic protease - antiprotease imbalance , at the core of a1atd , is a possible central factor .
the increased systemic inflammatory state in the patients , when clinically stable and heightened at times of exacerbation may be a mechanism of the altered large artery haemodynamics [ 15,23 ] .
this relationship corresponds to the literature between systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk in both the general population and in patients with copd [ 16,24 ] .
inflammation is associated with endothelial dysfunction but may also promote arterial stiffness by direct effects on vessel architecture and vascular smooth muscle function [ 25 - 27 ] .
the association of a1at with inflammatory and coagulation pathways and the a1at link to hdl and its functional properties are interesting considerations suggesting a pleiotropic beneficial effect of a1at , which the deficient state exposes [ 8,9,28 ] .
importantly , the a1at deficiency may have a direct effect on the elastin of the larger arteries , leading to altered structure and function .
talmud et al. described a protective role for a1at in the progression of established coronary artery atherogenesis , based on angiography and the genotyping of 800 subjects in 2 clinical trials [ 13 ] .
indeed , aldonyte et al. demonstrated that a1at is taken up by pulmonary endothelial cells using in vitro porcine cultures and appears to have a protective role against cigarette smoke induced endothelial apoptosis [ 29 ] .
similarly , the transformational polymerisation of aat in a1atd subjects , present not just in hepatocytes but circulating and in the lung and systemic endothelium are pro - inflammatory and inactivate the protein as an inhibitor of proteases ( thereby reducing any anti - protease protection further ) and hence may be contributory to the altered haemodynamics [ 30,31 ] .
indeed , such a protease - antiprotease imbalance mechanism may account for the cross - sectional association of emphysema severity ( using ct ) with both low bmd and increased arterial stiffness in usual copd [ 5,6 ] .
however , in these copd studies , knowledge and quantification of protease - antiprotease activity and level are not described .
interestingly , mcallister et. al. reported that emphysema severity was an independent variable , over airways obstruction and the systemic inflammatory mediator crp , for brachial pwv in patients with usual copd [ 5 ] .
it is conceivable that a systemic proteolytic process is occurring in the emphysematous spectrum of copd including a1atd subjects affecting arterial wall structure ; however conclusive proof either way is beyond the scope of this study .
increased aortic distensibilty , a suboptimal measure of arterial stiffness , has been reported in a small number of male patients with a1atd but not the female subset where the authors sought to assess the risk of aortic aneurysms [ 12 ] .
the use of historical controls and the wide age range from early adulthood limits its interpretation .
meanwhile , other reports have postulated that a1atd may actually be associated with a reduced risk of ischaemic heart disease and lower bp , however subject numbers were low , especially of the homozygous pizz genotype , n = 6 [ 32 ] .
increased arterial stiffness , measured by apwv confers an increased and independent cardiovascular risk [ 10,11 ] .
this has been firmly established through a wealth of studies in both general populations and various at - risk disease groups [ 8 ] .
addressing central haemodynamic measurements have become key outcome measures in cardiovascular studies , as alterations in large artery haemodynamics may not be detected using only standard peripheral measurements [ 33,34 ] .
the clinical relevance of this increased cardiovascular risk is demonstrated by the high cardiovascular mortality seen in copd patients in general [ 3,35 ] .
patients with a1atd often present at a younger age than usual copd and indeed , here , the subjects were about 5 years younger than subjects in previously reported usual copd studies , which have previously excluded a1atd .
despite this younger age group , the patients with a1atd have striking systemic consequences and may well reflect an accelerated ageing process [ 36,37 ] .
the extent of these systemic consequences in usual copd has only recently been prioritised and we now highlight in a1atd .
optimisation of risk factors is imperative and exercise regimes or pulmonary rehabilitation may offer additional improvement in any functional alteration leading to arterial stiffness [ 38 ] .
the similar results for aix - 75 between the 2 groups are in keeping with the non - linear relationship with age of this measure , which plateaus over the age of 50 years and hence deemed less sensitive to change in this age group .
the mechanism of low bmd in these patients is similarly likely to be due to several mechanisms .
some patients had been exposed to short courses of oral corticosteroids although none were on maintenance therapy .
previously , we have reported a lower bmd occurs in patients with usual copd even if steroid naive suggesting other " copd related factors " are likely to be additional key factors [ 39 ] .
in this current study , vitamin d levels were low across both patients and controls suggesting it may play only a limited or no additional role .
to allow for seasonal variation in vitamin d , all subjects were studied during winter period .
like cardiovascular disease , a low bmd may be related to the circulating inflammation but additionally to deconditioning as evidenced by the low ffm , the shorter 6mwd and lower physical activity scores seen in these patients compared to controls .
interestingly , however , the ffmi was globally low throughout all the body regions and not confined to lower limbs .
previously we have reported that patients with usual copd with osteoporosis had elevated apwv [ 16 ] , however the current study was not powered for such an outcome and description of the co - morbidities was our primary aim .
limitations of study the study size is small due to difficulty in recruiting eligible pi zz a1atd patients within a commutable distance of the research centre .
the comprehensive exclusion criteria prevented other confounders , such as diabetes or known cardiovascular disease from exaggerating or affecting the primary aim of identifying the hidden co - morbidities .
collaboration with adapt ensured the sample size was sufficient to achieve our aims based on the power calculation .
a proportion were ex or current smokers , albeit more modest exposure than usual copd patients .
this is inevitable given smoking remains the trigger that precipitates the emphysematous change in a1atd and hence presentation to physicians .
emphysema index was not measured universally in subjects and hence not included .
the cross sectional nature of the study does not allow causal relationships between a1atd , arterial stiffness , low bmd and systemic inflammation to be inferred but does show relationships that would suggest that further longitudinal studies may be informative and highlights a priority for full assessment of the co - morbidities in patients with a1atd .
lastly , the presence of such extrapulmonary manifestations in patients with the heterozygote state remains to be explored and may indicate whether the presence of the z protein alone plays a role rather than the low a1at level .
in conclusion , patients with copd related to pizz a1atd had increased aortic stiffness compared with age and gender matched controls without chronic lung disease , despite the similar risk profiles such as smoking , blood pressure and lipid levels .
such patients also had a lower bmd with evidence of osteoporosis and a low skeletal muscle mass .
there is thus a priority to explore underlying mechanisms as to why patients copd due to a1atd are at risk of these systemic consequences , which are hugely under - recognised in clinical practice but contribute to morbidity and necessitate optimal management .

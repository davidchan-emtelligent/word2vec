background multimorbidity is common and associated with poor clinical outcomes and high health care costs .
administrative data are a promising tool for studying the epidemiology of multimorbidity .
our goal was to derive and apply a new scheme for using administrative data to identify the presence of chronic conditions and multimorbidity .
methods we identified validated algorithms that use icd - 9 cm / icd - 10 data to ascertain the presence or absence of 40 morbidities .
algorithms with both positive predictive value and sensitivity >= 70 % were graded as " high validity " ; those with positive predictive value >= 70 % and sensitivity < 70 % were graded as " moderate validity " .
to show proof of concept , we applied identified algorithms with high to moderate validity to inpatient and outpatient claims and utilization data from 574,409 people residing in edmonton , canada during the 2008 / 2009 fiscal year .
results of the 40 morbidities , we identified 30 that could be identified with high to moderate validity .
approximately one quarter of participants had identified multimorbidity ( 2 or more conditions ) , one quarter had a single identified morbidity and the remaining participants were not identified as having any of the 30 morbidities .
conclusions we identified a panel of 30 chronic conditions that can be identified from administrative data using validated algorithms , facilitating the study and surveillance of multimorbidity .
we encourage other groups to use this scheme , to facilitate comparisons between settings and jurisdictions .

keywords multimorbidity administrative data issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background management of chronic disease is the major challenge facing health systems worldwide [ 1 ] .
many people with chronic disease have multiple chronic conditions , which is termed multimorbidity [ 2 ] .
it is clear that multimorbidity is common and associated with worse clinical outcomes and higher health care costs , compared to good health or to the presence of a single chronic condition [ 3 - 6 ] .
however , there are key knowledge gaps concerning the basic epidemiology of multimorbidity [ 7 ] ; its clinical and economic consequences ; and how it contributes to disparities in health [ 8 ] .
this information is prerequisite to mitigating the impact of multimorbidity and chronic disease [ 9 ] .
multimorbidity has been identified as a key research priority by the public health agency of canada , and is crucial to inform programming and resource forecasting .
knowledge of secular changes in the incidence and prevalence of multimorbidity is required , and would be facilitated by methods for identifying the presence of multimorbidity using administrative data .
identifying morbidity using administrative data can be simple ( e.g. , based on a single hospitalization and using only a small number of codes ) or complex ( e.g. , including inpatient and outpatient encounters and long lists of codes ) .
once developed , algorithms may be validated against a suitable gold standard ( e.g. , chart reviews ; other previously validated algorithms ) .
previous work by barnett et al [ 3 ] identified 40 morbidities and were informed by a systematic review of multimorbidity measures [ 10 ] , the quality and outcomes framework of the uk general practice contract , and health service planning by nhs scotland .
however , these authors used administrative data sources that are unique to the united kingdom to identify the presence or absence of these conditions .
a corresponding scheme based on the more widely used icd - 9 cm / icd - 10 system is not available .
therefore , we first identified previously validated algorithms that use the icd - 9 cm / icd - 10 system for ascertaining the presence of chronic conditions using inpatient and outpatient claims and utilization data .
we then showed proof of concept for using administrative data to study multimorbidity , by applying these previously validated algorithms to a population of adults residing in edmonton , canada between april 2008 and march 2009 .
methods the institutional review boards at the university of alberta ( pro00038795 ) and the university of calgary ( e22590 ) approved the study .
morbidities we did a focused literature search for validated algorithms that use icd - 9 cm / icd - 10 codes in administrative data from inpatient and outpatient encounters to ascertain the presence or absence of the 40 morbidities identified by barnett et al [ 3 ] .
we searched medline using combinations of the following mesh subject headings together with the specific morbidity of interest : ' international classification of diseases ' , ' reproducibility of results ' , and ' sensitivity and specificity ' .
based on an a priori decision , we considered algorithms to be of high validity if they had both positive predictive value ( ppv ) and sensitivity >= 70 % as compared to an acceptable gold standard such as chart review .
we considered algorithms to be of moderate validity if they had ppv >= 70 % but sensitivity < 70 % .
the cut - off values for ppv and sensitivity were based on previous validation studies of administrative data [ 11 ] .
we did not consider negative predictive value or specificity , because these parameters are generally > 90 % in studies of chronic diseases among the general population [ 11,12 ] .
the definition of multimorbidity required the coexistence of two or more of the morbidities .
in a secondary analysis we used a more restrictive definition that required three or more morbidities to be present .
icd codes canadian hospital discharge abstract data are coded with icd - 10 ca , which essentially increases specificity compared to the icd - 10 system by adding more digits [ 11 ] .
all of the icd - 10 codes from the included algorithms are consistent with icd - 10 ca codes , and thus we used icd - 10 and icd - 10 ca codes interchangeably throughout this manuscript .
when icd - 10 codes were not given in the primary papers , we used the canadian institute for health information ( cihi ; www.cihi.ca ) conversion table to convert icd - 9 cm codes to icd - 10 codes .
many algorithms required multiple codes within a specified time period to determine incidence of morbidity ( table 1 ) .
in each case the index date for the disease was considered to be the date of the first code .
for example , in order to determine presence of asthma , we searched for icd - 9 cm 493 and icd - 10 j45 codes in hospitalizations and outpatient encounters .
we considered asthma to have developed at the first instance of a single hospitalization with either of these codes , or a single outpatient encounter followed by two further outpatient encounters with either of these codes within two years .
in either case , we considered the participant to have asthma for the duration of follow - up. table 1 administrative algorithms for 30 morbidities number and nature of claims required to substantiate the diagnosis morbidity algorithm hospitalizations claims accs years icd - 9 cm icd - 10 permanent citation alcohol misuse ^ 1 hospitalization or 2 claims in 2 years or less 1 2 . 2 265.2 , 291.1 - 291.3 , 291.5 - 291.9 , 303.0 , 303.9 , 305.0 , 357.5 , 425.5 , 535.3 , 571.0 - 571.3 , 980 , v11.3 e52 , f10 , g62.1 , i42.6,k29.2 , k70.0 , k70.3 , k70.9 , t51 , z50.2 , z71.4 , z72.1 y quan 2008 [ 11 ] , 2005 [ 17 ] asthma 1 hospitalization or 3 accs in 2 years or less 1 . 3 2 493 j45 y gershon 2009 [ 37 ] atrial fibrillation 1 hospitalization or 2 claims in 2 years or less 1 2 . 2 427.3 & i48.0 y alonso 2009 [ 38 ] cancer , lymphoma 1 hospitalization or 2 claims in 2 years or less 1 2 . 2 200 - 202 , 203.0 , 238.6 c81 - c85 , c88 , c90.0 , c90.2 , c96 n 5 y quan 2008 [ 11 ] , 2005 [ 17 ] cancer , metastatic 1 hospitalization or 2 claims in 2 years or less 1 2 . 2 196 - 199 c77 - c80 n 5 y quan 2008 [ 11 ] , 2005 [ 17 ] cancer , non - metastatic ( breast , cervical , colorectal , lung , prostate ) 1 hospitalization or 2 claims in 2 years or less 1 2 . 2 153 - 154 , 162 - 163 , 174 , 180 , 185 , 230.3 - 230.6 , 231.2 , 233.0 - 233.1 , 233.4 c18 - c21 , c33 - c34 , c38.4 , c45.0 , c46.71 , c50 , c53 , c61 , d01.0 - d01.3 , d02.2 , d05 - d06 , d07.5 n 5 y penberthy 2003 [ 39 ] chronic heart failure $^ 1 hospitalization or 2 claims in 2 years or less 1 2 . 2 398.91 , 402.01 , 402.11 , 402.91 , 404.01 , 404.03 , 404.11 , 404.13 , 404.91 , 404.93 , 425.4 - 425.9 , 428 i09.9 , i25.5 , i42.0 , i42.5 - i42.9 , i43 , i50 y quan 2008 [ 11 ] , 2005 [ 17 ] chronic kidney disease mean egfr < 60 ml / min * 1.73 m2 or mean albuminuria > 30 mg / g over 12 months . .

proof of concept we applied identified algorithms with high or moderate validity to a population - based administrative dataset from alberta health ( ah ; the provincial health ministry ) and alberta clinical laboratories .
details of this administrative dataset including claims , hospitalizations and ambulatory care classification system ( accs ) utilization are given in figure 1 and have been reported elsewhere [ 13 ] .
we assembled a cohort of adults aged >= 18 years who resided in the city of edmonton , alberta between april 2008 and march 2009 , and included all people registered with ah. all alberta residents are eligible for insurance coverage by ah , and > 99 % participate in this coverage .
the dataset included demographic information such as postal code of residence , laboratory data , and medication in those aged >= 65 years [ 13 ] .
we identified edmonton residents from the ah registry file using the community name variable from the statistics canada postal code 2008 conversion file [ 14 ] ( www.statcan.gc.ca ) .

to demonstrate proof of concept for applying these algorithms to a large administrative dataset , we presented a simple summary of the prevalence of morbidity and multimorbidity in the study population .
counts and percentages were presented along with a figure showing how the number of morbidities varies by age .
in sensitivity analyses , we presented the prevalence of morbidity as assessed by different sources of administrative data .
results algorithms we identified 16 morbidities for which the best identified algorithm was of high validity : asthma , atrial fibrillation , metastatic cancer , chronic heart failure , chronic kidney disease , chronic pain , cirrhosis , diabetes , hypertension , irritable bowel syndrome , multiple sclerosis , myocardial infarction , peripheral vascular disease , psoriasis , schizophrenia and severe constipation .
we identified an additional 14 morbidities ( including two algorithms for other types of cancer and one algorithm for another type of liver disease ) for which the best identified algorithm was of moderate validity : alcohol misuse , lymphoma , non - metastatic cancer ( breast , cervical , colorectal , lung , and prostate ) , chronic pulmonary disease , chronic viral hepatitis b , dementia , depression , epilepsy , hypothyroidism , inflammatory bowel disease , parkinson 's disease , peptic ulcer disease , rheumatoid arthritis , and stroke or transient ischemic attack .
we excluded the remaining morbidities for which no suitable algorithm could be identified ( additional file 1 table s1 ) .
thus we identified 30 conditions using administrative algorithms ( including icd - 9 cm and icd - 10 codes ) that are summarized in the table 1. of these 30 algorithms , half were validated for both icd - 9 cm and icd - 10 codes .
we identified all conditions exclusively using icd - 9 cm and icd - 10 data with the exception of chronic kidney disease , for which we used a validated algorithm applied to icd - 9 cm and icd - 10 data [ 15 ] and supplemented using serum creatinine and albuminuria data [ 16 ] .
we considered chronic kidney disease to be present if a participant met either the administrative or laboratory criteria .
in some cases , we made minor changes to the published algorithms to improve anticipated diagnostic performance , to increase consistency between algorithms used for the different conditions , and to include application to the outpatient setting .
first , the original publications by quan et al [ 11,17 ] required one hospitalization to identify the presence of a chronic condition ; based on input from the first author of that paper , we modified this algorithm to allow either one inpatient code or two outpatient codes within two years to define the presence of these conditions .
second , to improve mapping of icd - 9 codes from the original ( published ) algorithm into icd - 10 , we combined the ' highly likely ' and the ' likely ' codes from the original algorithm for chronic pain [ 18 ] .
third , for consistency , we modified algorithms that defined conditions as present if participants had two codes within any duration of follow - up ( no matter how long ) to require that the two codes occur within a three year period [ 19,20 ] .
fourth , we expanded the criteria for presence of atrial fibrillation , epilepsy , irritable bowel syndrome , and severe constipation to include two outpatient codes within two years for these conditions .
however , to ensure that secondary ( post - surgical ) bowel complications were not incorrectly classified as chronic bowel conditions , we excluded any hospitalization for surgery when assessing the presence or absence of these conditions [ 21 ] .
fifth , we expanded the criteria for presence of stroke or tia to include one outpatient code .
sixth , we reviewed all algorithms for overlapping codes ( situations where the same code was used to identify more than one condition ) , and modified the algorithms to avoid double - counting of morbidities ( see footnotes in the table 1 for specific details ) .
application of the algorithms to the edmonton cohort the study cohort included 574,409 participants ( figure 1 , table 2 ) .
almost two - thirds were less than 50 years of age .
ten percent were 70 years of age or older and the proportion of men and women was similar .
approximately half of all participants were not identified as having any of the 30 morbidities for which high or moderate validity algorithms existed .

bdemonstrates morbidities where prevalence was reduced > 50 % compared to all three sources .
the prevalence values in the first column and the bold prevalence values in the remaining columns are estimates from the final algorithms given in table 1 .
the bolded prevalence values indicate which administrative datasets were used in the final algorithms .
1values in brackets include laboratory data ( estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria ) as gold standard measures of kidney function the apparent prevalence of most morbidities was greatly reduced ( often by 50 % or more ) when we assessed their presence or absence using hospitalization data only ( table 2 ) .
the addition of accs data to hospitalization and claims data made little difference to prevalence estimates , with the possible exceptions of chronic pain , hepatitis b and cirrhosis ( the prevalences of which all changed by > 20 %) .
in most cases , the algorithms as originally validated resulted in a prevalence that was intermediate between the most inclusive approach ( using hospitalization , claims and accs data ) and the most restrictive approach ( using hospitalization data only ) .
as expected , adding gold standard laboratory data for kidney function ( egfr and albuminuria ) resulted in substantial increases in the apparent prevalence of chronic kidney disease as compared to administrative data alone , regardless of which administrative data sources were used .
figure 2 depicts the percentage of participants with multimorbidity by age group .
after hypertension ( a prevalence of 23 %) , 21 % had chronic kidney disease , 9 % had diabetes , and 9 % had depression .
figure 2 number of morbidities by age in edmonton , alberta during the april 2008 to march 2009 fiscal year .
discussion from a published list of chronic conditions [ 3 ] , we identified a total of 30 validated algorithms including 3 algorithms for different types of cancer and 2 algorithms for liver disease .
we applied the algorithms to icd codes from claims and utilization data , and identified the presence or absence of these conditions in a cohort of 574,409 adults residing in edmonton , alberta between april 2008 and march 2009 ( figure 1 ) .
the overall prevalence of multimorbidity in this cohort was 26 % , which is similar to the prevalence as reported in the barnett study [ 3 ] .
our findings demonstrate proof of concept for using administrative data as a surveillance tool for multimorbidity in settings with systems for reliably capturing population - based claims and utilization data .
multiple prior studies have ascertained the presence of various chronic conditions in the context of assessing multimorbidity [ 4,7,22 - 34 ] .
although there is no universally accepted definition of multimorbidity ( or a list of conditions that should be used to assess the presence of multimorbidity ) there appears to be consensus on several issues .
first , health conditions used to define multimorbidity should be chronic but not necessarily permanent .
second , two or more concomitant conditions should be required to identify a person as having multimorbidity .
third , an attempt should be made to standardize definitions across studies to facilitate comparisons between populations [ 7,9,34,35 ] .
at the same time , it is important that algorithms selected for use with administrative data should be validated against a gold standard - and demonstrate acceptable diagnostic properties so as to ensure reasonably accurate classification of individuals with respect to morbidity status .
we focused on validated algorithms with positive predictive value and sensitivity >= 70 % , compared to an acceptable gold standard such as chart review .
because we had access to laboratory data allowing a gold standard assessment of kidney function , we primarily assessed the presence of chronic kidney disease using estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) and albuminuria rather than administrative data .
to our knowledge , this is the most comprehensive panel of validated algorithms yet applied to administrative data for the study of multimorbidity .
other studies have used reasonable but unvalidated algorithms , a more limited list of candidate chronic conditions or both .
although there are undoubtedly other chronic conditions that could be identified using administrative data , we focused on those for which available algorithms appear to have adequate sensitivity as well as positive predictive value .
we will use the set of algorithms described herein as the foundation for a series of studies describing the epidemiology of multimorbidity in alberta , canada .
besides the various definitions of multimorbidity that they have used , existing studies in this area have several other limitations [ 36 ] .
first , population - based studies are rare ( especially in canadian settings ) ; most studies have captured patients followed by a particular centre and are vulnerable to referral bias .
second , most studies have been unable to assess the link between multimorbidity and clinical outcomes in subgroups defined by age , sex , or low socioeconomic status .
third , little is known about the relative frequency of individual chronic conditions within the multimorbidity syndrome - or about which clusters of conditions are most common and / or clinically significant .
fourth , studies examining the economic consequences of multimorbidity have typically used relatively unsophisticated methods and / or studied only select populations .
the scheme outlined in the current manuscript will allow our group to do future studies that close these knowledge gaps - informing policy and practice .
we are optimistic that the scheme will also be used by other researchers from other jurisdictions with similar datasets - facilitating comparisons between studies .
future studies should test the relative importance of the morbidities identified in the current manuscript , as well as considering other potentially important morbidities for inclusion .
limitations of the current approach include those common to all studies using administrative data .
for example , we do not have information on potential confounders related to lifestyle ( e.g. , diet , smoking , exercise ) or on measured blood pressure , which may be confounders when examining the association between multimorbidity and outcomes or costs .
however , this limitation would not be expected to affect feasibility of applying the algorithms or the prevalence estimates reported here .
second , identification of some of the chronic conditions we studied might have been enhanced by simultaneous consideration of medication data [ 3 ] .
we decided against including publicly funded medication data to define these conditions because medication coverage in alberta is limited to people aged >= 65 years ; those of lower ses ; or with high annual medication costs .
thus , using medication data to define conditions would have biased towards a higher incidence of multimorbidity in older , poorer and sicker participants .
we decided against restricting the cohort to people aged >= 65 years , because multimorbidity is relatively common in younger participants - and there might be important differences in the nature and implications of multimorbidity by age .
therefore , we will include all adult albertans in our forthcoming analyses .
third , since participants must use medical services to be diagnosed with chronic conditions , our findings underestimate the true population burden of multimorbidity - especially for conditions that are less likely to lead to hospitalization but which may still significantly impact quality of life and other important outcomes .
fourth , we did not identify appropriate algorithms for all of the 40 target conditions , possibly because our searches were not exhaustive , and other important conditions such as obesity were not considered in this study .
therefore , our results likely underestimate the true prevalence of multimorbidity .
finally , although we focused on validated algorithms , the diagnostic performance of algorithms may vary between settings , based on coding practices and the reliability of data capture - and we did not systematically evaluate the quality of the original studies .
therefore ( despite the lack of an a priori reason to suspect worse performance in our dataset ) , it is possible that some algorithms that were of high or moderate validity in other jurisdictions may perform less well when applied to alberta data , especially with the modifications as described herein .
conclusions in summary , we identified a panel of 30 chronic conditions that can be identified from administrative data using validated algorithms , facilitating the study and surveillance of multimorbidity .
we encourage other groups to use this scheme , to facilitate comparisons of data on multimorbidity between settings and jurisdictions .

phase iii studies have demonstrated the efficacy of folfoxiri regimens ( 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin , oxaliplatin , irinotecan ) with / without bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer ( mcrc ) .
capecitabine is an orally administered fluoropyrimidine that may be used instead of 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin .
we evaluated a triple - chemotherapy regimen of capecitabine , oxaliplatin , and irinotecan , plus bevacizumab in 53 patients with mcrc .
a phase i study identified the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan as 150 mg / m2 .
median follow - up in a subsequent phase ii study using this dose was 28 months ( 74 % progressed ) .
for all patients , a complete response was achieved in 4 % and a partial response in 60 % ; median progression - free survival ( pfs ) was 16 months and median overall survival ( os ) was 28 months .
median pfs was longer for patients with an early treatment response ( 28 vs. 9 months for others ; p = 0.024 ) , or early tumor shrinkage ( 25 vs. 9 months for others ; p = 0.006 ) , or for patients suitable for surgical removal of metastases with curative intent ( median not reached vs. 9 months for others ; p = 0.001 ) .
median os was longer for patients with early tumor shrinkage ( median not reached vs. 22 months for others ; p = 0.006 ) or surgery ( median not reached vs. 22 months for others , p = 0.002 ) .
k - ras mutations status did not influence pfs ( p = 0.88 ) or os ( p = 0.82 ) .
considerable grade 3 / 4 toxicity was encountered ( 36 % for diarrhea , 21 % for vomiting and 17 % for fatigue ) .
in conclusion , the 3 - weekly triple - chemotherapy regimen of capecitabine , oxaliplatin , and irinotecan , plus bevacizumab , was active in the first - line treatment of mcrc , although at the expense of a high level of toxicity .
bevacizumab capecitabine irinotecan metastatic colorectal cancer oxaliplatin introduction colorectal cancer ( crc ) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second most common in females ; more than 1.2 million new cases and 608,700 deaths have occurred worldwide in 2008 .
1 chemotherapy remains the primary therapeutic option for patients with metastatic crc ( mcrc ) .
combinations of fluoropyrimidines , irinotecan , and oxaliplatin have been shown to be effective in this setting , along with the more recent introduction of targeted chemotherapy with monoclonal antibodies against the vascular endothelial growth factor ( bevacizumab ) or the epidermal growth factor receptor ( cetuximab and panitumumab ) .
the addition of a targeted agent to first line chemotherapy has improved progression free survival ( pfs ) and overall survival ( os ) in randomized trials 2 - 6 and is now considered to represent the standard of care for mcrc .
phase iii trials have shown the folfoxiri ( 5 - flourouracil [ 5 - fu ]/ leucovorin , oxaliplatin , irinotecan ) to be superior to the folfiri ( 5 - fu / leucovorin , irinotecan ) regimen , in terms of improvements in response rate , pfs , and os , with or without addition of bevacizumab 7,8 .
this improved efficacy was at the expense of increased toxicity which was manageable , as the incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity did not exceed 20 % 7 - 9 .
nevertheless , infusional chemotherapy requires a central venous catheter with its associated complications , frequent hospital visits ( every 2 weeks ) and the need to carry a pump .
capecitabine , an oral fluoropyrimidine , was at least as active and effective as 5 - fu in the first - line treatment of mcrc in phase iii trials , with a superior safety profile 10 - 12 .
similarly , a combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin ( xelox or capox ) but not irinotecan ( xeliri / capiri ) was at least as effective as its infusional counterpart , folfox 13 - 19 .
it is therefore of interest to study the therapeutic profile of capecitabine within a triple - therapy regimen , with the addition of targeted chemotherapy in mcrc .
accordingly , we have evaluated the combination of capecitabine , oxaliplatin , and irinotecan with bevacizumab in the first - line management of mcrc in a phase i / ii trial .
materials and methods patients the study was conducted at a single institution .
patients eligible for inclusion in the study were men or women aged >= 18 years with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma presenting as unresectable metastatic or locally advanced disease ; eastern cooperative oncology group performance status ( ecog ps ) of 0 - 2 ; measurable disease as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist ) ; no previous chemotherapy or bevacizumab for metastatic disease ; and adequate hematological , renal , and hepatic function ( absolute neutrophil count >= 1.5 x 109 / l , platelet count >= 100 x 109 / l , normal serum creatinine , normal serum bilirubin , serum transaminases <= 2.5 times the upper limit of normal [ unl ; <= 5.0 times unl if elevated secondary to liver metastases ]) ; and urine dipstick for protinuria < 2 + .
patients who had received prior adjuvant 5 - fu or oxaliplatin chemotherapy were eligible if they had remained free of disease for at least 12 months after the completion of adjuvant therapy .
exclusion criteria included patients with known or suspected dihydropyrimidine deficiency ; the presence of central nervous system metastasis ; previous malignancy within the last 5 years ( except adequately treated nonmelanomatous skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer ) ; severe cardiovascular disease ; major bleeding disorder ; significant traumatic injury or major surgery within 28 days of starting therapy ; minor surgery within 7 days of starting therapy ; recent significant hemoptysis ; active uncontrolled infection ; uncontrolled hypertension ; pregnancy or breastfeeding ; any other serious medical condition ( in the judgment of the investigator ) ; treatment with other experimental drugs within 30 days of entry into the trial ; treatment with other anticancer therapy ; known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs ; any psychological , familial , geographic , or social circumstances which could impair the patient 's ability to participate in the trial and comply with follow - up , including legal incapacity .
treatment pretreatment baseline evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination , full blood count and chemistry profile including carcinoembryonic antigen , and a ct scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis .
the phase i trial was designed to find the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan , with a design based on the standard 3 - week xelox / capox regimen , in order to minimize the requirements for hospital attendance while maintaining efficacy .
all patients received oral capecitabine 1000 mg / m2 twice - daily on days 1 - 14 , with intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg / m2 , and bevacizumab 7.5 mg / kg body weight on day 1 .
the prespecified dose levels for irinotecan were 150 , 200 , and 250 mg / m2 , given intravenously on day one of each cycle .
the starting dose was based on previous clinical experience with the use of irinotecan within three - drug combinations , which involved administration of this agent at starting doses of 150 - 180 mg / m2 given every 2 weeks 20,21 .
accordingly , we adopted the dose of 150 mg / m2 as a starting dose to explore the maximum tolerated dose within the more standard three - weekly administration regimen employed here .
at least three patients were included sequentially in each dose level , and no intrapatient dose - escalation was allowed .
dose escalation was permitted if no dose limiting toxicity ( any grade 4 hematological toxicity and / or grade 3 or 4 nonhematological toxicity ) was encountered by the end of the first cycle .
if one of three patients experienced dose - limiting toxicity , three additional patients were enrolled at the same dose level .
the maximum tolerated dose was defined according to the occurrence of dose - limiting toxicity in least 2 / 3 or at least 4 / 6 patients .
the recommended dose for the phase ii study was the dose level immediately below the maximum tolerated dose .
additional patients were then enrolled to confirm the safety profile of the combination 22 .
treatment was administered every 21 days .
a total of 5 - 8 cycles of the four drug combination was planned , followed by maintenance capecitabine and bevacizumab at the same dose level until disease progression .
during either phase , the feasibility of surgical resection of metastatic sites was assessed every 2 months and strongly recommended when feasible .
treatment was withdrawn in the event of disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal of patient consent .
dose modification dose modifications were made according to the most serious toxicity observed during the previous cycle , graded according to the national cancer institute common terminology criteria ( version 3 ) 23 .
only the capecitabine dose was modified for hand - foot syndrome and mucositis , the capecitabine , and irinotecan doses could be modified for diarrhea , and the oxaliplatin was modified for neuropathy .
bevacizumab doses were not modified .
chemotherapy treatment was delayed until neutrophil count was >= 1.0 x 109 / l and platelet count was >= 100 x 109 / l prior to start of the next cycle .
patients were withdrawn from the trial if toxicity required treatment to be delayed by more than 2 weeks .
study endpoints the primary endpoint for the phase i study was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan .
primary outcomes for the phase ii study were the response rate and toxicity profile in patients with mcrc .
secondary endpoints were pfs and os. pfs was calculated from the day of treatment start to the first observation of disease progression or death from any cause .
os was calculated from the day of treatment start until death from any cause , censoring patients where necessary at the last date known to be alive .
evaluation of response assessment of response was done according to recist criteria , version 1.1 24 a ct scan or mri scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis were done after the second , fifth and eighth cycle of chemotherapy and then every 2 months .
this schedule facilitated detection of early tumor shrinkage after the first 6 weeks , followed by subsequent regular , two - monthly evaluation .
deepness of response ( dpr ) was defined as the percentage of tumor shrinkage observed ( if shrinkage occurred ) at the nadir ( best response ) using the longest diameter based on recist criteria 25 .
early tumor shrinkage was defined as >= 20 % decrease in the maximum tumor dimension by recist criteria at the time of first evaluation of response 26 .
follow - up and end of study visits all patients underwent measurement of complete blood count with differential , renal , and hepatic profile , carcino - emberyonic antigen ( cea ) , and urine for proteinuria on day one of each cycle .
blood count was also done on the day 10 - 14 for the first two cycles .
toxicity evaluation was recorded prior to starting treatment and on day 1 of each cycle of chemotherapy .
patients were followed up until the study was closed upon reaching the planned number of events .
statistics the number of patients to be recruited in the phase i trial was depended on the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan .
the number of patients for the phase ii trial followed a two - stage simon optima design to include the patient recruited in phase i. for a lower activity level of 40 % ( p0 = 0.40 , percentage of patients free of progression at 10 months in the null hypothesis ) and higher activity level of 60 % ( p1 = 0.60 , percentage of patients free of progression at 10 months in the alternative hypothesis ) , and with alpha and beta error of 0.05 and 0.20 , the phase i trial was planned to recruit 16 patients .
if fewer than seven patients achieved an objective response , the trial would close as the study treatment was not more effective than standard chemotherapy .
if more than seven patients in phase i achieved an objective response then a total of 46 patients would be recruited .
kaplan - meier survival curves were compared using log - rank tests .
statistical analyses were performed using spss version 17.0 ( ibm corporation , armonk , ny , usa ) .
the efficacy analysis was performed on the intention - to - treat population , which comprised all patients who received at least two cycles of study treatment .
ethics the study was carried out fully in accordance with the requirements of good clinical practice and the declaration of helsinki .
the protocol was approved by the ethics committees of our institution .
patients were informed of the investigational nature of the study and provided written informed consent before registration .
the trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( nct01311050 ) .
results patients fifty - four patients were entered into the phase i and phase ii studies between 24 january 2009 and 14 december 2011 .
one patient was found at a later stage to have a concurrent chaolangiocarcinoma , rather than metastatic colon cancer and was excluded from analyses other than the phase i toxicity evaluation .
all other analyses included the remaining 53 patients .
the study population was roughly equally divided between men and women ( table1 ) .
the majority of patients had ecog ps 2 , with tumors in the colon or rectosigmoid .
about half had undergone surgery , a minority had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy , but none had received radiotherapy .
similar numbers of patients had single or multiple metastases , most commonly in the liver .
wild - type k - ras or k - ras mutations were also found in similar numbers of patients .

maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan in the phase i study three patients were received irinotecan at a dose of 150 mg / m2 , of whom one developed grade 4 diarrhea and fatigue in cycle 2 .
three further patients received irinotecan 200 mg / m2 , of whom one developed grade 3 diarrhea and neutropenia and one developed grade 3 vomiting .
the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan was therefore 150 mg / m2 .
recruitment commenced for the phase ii trial using this dose level and an additional 47 patients were enrolled .
however , a high incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxicity ( mainly diarrhea ) led to a reduction in the capecitabine dose to 800 mg / m2 twice daily after 30 patients had been enrolled .
treatments a total of 230 cycles of treatment were administered , with a median of five cycles per patient ( range 1 - 8 ) .
six patients received only one cycle of chemotherapy , either due to withdrawal of consent or grade 4 toxicity .
thirty - four patients received the planned 5 - 8 cycles of induction triplet chemotherapy .
reasons for receipt of less than five cycles included toxicity in 11 patients , progression in four patients , withdrawn consent in three patients , and temporary loss of follow - up in a further patient .
the relative dose intensity was 92 % of that planned for irinotecan and oxaliplatin , and 79 % of that planned for capecitabine .
maintenance treatment with capecitabine and bevacizumab was administered to 32 patients ( 60 %) .
surgical resection of metastatic disease ( table2 ) was attempted with a curative intent in 13 patients ( 24.5 %) : four ( 7.5 %) had surgical resection of the primary tumor , three ( 11.3 %) had liver resection only , and six ( 11.3 %) underwent cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy .
radical ( r0 ) resection was achieved in 10 patients ( 18.9 %) with a pathological complete response ( pcr ) in two of these patients ( each had pcr of the primary tumor and of the metastasis in the liver or peritoneum ) .

efficacy of the 53 patients included in efficacy analyses , 45 were evaluable for response evaluation ( four patients withdrew consent , two were discontinued for grade 4 toxicity and two died ) .
two patients ( 4.4 %) had a complete response and 27 patients ( 60 %) had a partial response , for an overall response rate of 64.4 % .
stable disease was observed in 31.1 % and progressive disease in 4.4 % .
fifteen patients ( 33.3 %) achieved a response at the first evaluation ( early treatment response ) and 27 ( 60 %) achieved early tumor shrinkage .
the time to best response was 48 days ( range 18 - 1041 ) and the median dpr was 33 % ( range - 12 to 100 ) .
the median follow - up duration was 28 months ( range 1 - 50 ; 95 % ci 23 - 33 ) , at which time 39 patients ( 74 %) had progressed .
median pfs was 16 months and median os was 28 months in the overall population ( table3 , fig.1 ) .
median pfs was significantly longer in patients with early treatment response or early tumor shrinkage , or in subjects who underwent surgery with curative intent ( table3 , fig.2 ) .
os was significantly prolonged in subjects with early tumor shrinkage or surgical resection .

toxicity all 53 patients were evaluable for toxicity ( table4 ) .
diarrhea was the most common grade 3 / 4 toxicity was of diarrhea ( 36 %) , which was complicated by dehydration and renal impairment in one patient , and by neutropenia ( 32 %) , which was complicated by fever in nine patients .
other grade 3 / 4 adverse events were nausea / vomiting ( 21 %) , fatigue ( 17 %) , anemia ( 6 %) , thrombocytopenia ( 4 %) , and allergic reaction ( 4 %) .
grade 4 arterial thrombosis was reported in one patient who developed cerebrovascular thrombosis .

all deaths occurred outside our institution ; one developed fever at home and refused to go to a hospital , one death was secondary to cerebrovascular accident and one died from non - neutropenic septic shock .
there was no significant difference in toxicity between patients who received capecitabine at a dose of 1000 or 800 mg / m2 .
discussion the result of this trial are consistent with the results of previous randomized trials that demonstrated enhanced efficacy of the ripple - therapy regimens in mcrc 7,8 .
the response rate in our trial of 60 % is similar to the roughly 60 - 80 % response rates observed with other triple - therapy regimens 7,8,20,21,27,28 .
the pfs obtained in our regimen ( 16 months ) represents one of the best reported results so far in mcrc , although this did not translate to a similarly high os ( 28 months ) .
receipt of no more than five cycles by half of the patients and the high toxicity of the regimen may account for this finding .
we observed marked toxicity , with grade 3 and 4 diarrhea ( 35 %) requiring frequent dose reduction , especially of capecitabine , resulting in a low relative dose intensity for capecitabine of 79 % , although the dose reduction did not translate into a reduced frequency of grade 3 / 4 diarrhea .
febrile neutropenia was also common ( 17 %) , compared with other evaluations of triple regimens in mcrc 7,8,20,21,27,28 .
it is apparent that the planned dose intensity of both bi - weekly triplet regimens reported for capecitabine ( 5000 mg / m2 per week 20 and 7000 mg / m2 per week 21 ) was lower than in our trial , even after the capecitabine dose was reduced to 800 mg / m2 twice - daily ( 7466 mg / m2 per week ) .
this probably explains the difference in toxicity between our study and these earlier trials .
in addition , clinical experience in the middle east suggests that the tolerance of saudi patients to standard doses of capecitabine may be lower than that reported for western populations .
the toxicity encountered with our regimen might also be explained in part by 87 % of our patients having ps 1 - 2 .
nevertheless , other regimens combining capecitabine and irinotecan have yielded similar high rates of toxicity , with incidence rates for diarrhea approaching 40 % 18,19 .
these regimens maintained activity with decreased toxicity by lowering the doses of both irinotecan and capecitabine 29,30 .
we also demonstrated that the concept of early tumor shrinkage , reported previously , is not limited to anti - epidermal growth factor receptors ( egfr ) regimens 26,31,32 .
patients who achieved >= 20 % tumor shrinkage at the first evaluation ( after two cycles of induction therapy ) had improved pfs and os compared with patients who did not .
our study also confirmed the lack of influence of k - ras mutation status on prognosis in patients treated with a bevacizumab - containing triple - chemotherapy regimen , as reported elsewhere 27,33,34 .
it has been reported that surgery for resectable metastasis improves survival in patients with mcrc 35 - 37 , and our data provide further confirmation of this benefit .
in addition , our study confirms the high rate of r0 resection ( approaching 19 %) in patients treated with triple - chemotherapy regimens .
the high percentage of surgical resection confirms the feasibility of such procedures in patients receiving bevacizumab containing regimens .
the main limitations of our study were that it was a phase i / ii noncomparative trial , conducted at a single institution , and in a relatively small patient population .
on the other hand , our trial enrolled an unselected patient population who were similar to the patients we see in daily practice , as shown by the relatively high percentage of patients with ps 2 ( 20 %) and multiple organ involvement ( 58 %) .
in conclusion , the three weekly triple - chemotherapy regimen of capecitabine , oxaliplatin , and irinotecan , combined with bevacizumab , was active in the first line treatment of mcrc , although at the expense of a high level of toxicity .
we do not recommend further application of this regimen at the doses described above .
further evaluation of this regimen in a more selected group of patients with mcrc with better ps and an adjusted dose of capecitabine and irinotecan may yield lower toxicity while maintaining therapeutic activity .

malnutrition has been related to prolonged hospital stays , and to increases in readmission and mortality rates .
in the nourish ( nutrition effect on unplanned readmissions and survival in hospitalized patients ) study , administering a high protein oral nutritional supplement ( ons ) containing beta - hydroxy - beta - methylbutyrate ( hp - hmb ) to hospitalised older adult patients led to a significant improvement in survival compared with a placebo treatment .
the aim of this study was to determine whether hp - hmb would be cost - effective in spain .
we performed a cost - effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the spanish national health system using time horizons of 90 days , 180 days , 1 year , 2 years , 5 years and lifetime .
the difference in cost between patients treated with hp - hmb and placebo was euro332.75. with the 90 days time horizon , the difference in life years gained ( lyg ) between both groups was 0.0096 , resulting in an incremental cost - effectiveness ratio ( icer ) of euro34,700.62 / lyg. with time horizons of 180 days , 1 year , 2 years , 5 years and lifetime , the respective icers were euro13,711.68 , euro3377.96 , euro2253.32 , euro1127.34 and euro563.84 / lyg .
this analysis suggests that administering hp - hmb to older adult patients admitted to spanish hospitals during hospitalisation and after discharge could be a cost - effective intervention that would improve survival with a reduced marginal cost .
malnutrition oral nutritional supplement cost - effectiveness spain beta - hydroxy - beta - methylbutyrate nourish study 1 .
introduction malnutrition is a common condition in hospitalised patients .
observational studies carried out in spanish hospitals have estimated a prevalence of malnutrition of between 23 % and 70 % [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ] , depending on the population assessed and the screening and assessment tools used .
advanced age is a known risk factor for malnutrition [ 4 ] .
malnutrition has been related to an increased risk of postoperative infections and complications , extended stays in hospital and an increase in readmissions and mortality rates [ 8,9,10,11,12 ] .
this is accompanied by an increase in costs .
it has been estimated that , in spain , on average , malnutrition prolongs hospital stay by three days , with an overall annual cost of at least euro1143 billion [ 13 ] .
in systematic reviews , the use of high protein oral nutritional supplements ( ons ) has been linked to clinical , nutritional and functional improvements and significant reductions in the number of readmissions [ 14,15,16 ] .
more specifically , using high protein ons with beta - hydroxy - beta - methylbutyrate ( hp - hmb ) has been associated with improvements in muscle mass and function in adults both in hospital and community environments [ 16 ] .
however , evidence on the clinical benefits of nutritional supplements on mortality is limited [ 17 ] .
in the nutrition effect on unplanned readmissions and survival in hospitalized patients ( nourish ) study , the use of hp - hmb showed a decrease , compared with a placebo treatment , in mortality risk in the 90 - day post - discharge period ( 4.8 % vs. 9.7 % ; relative risk ( rr ) : 0.49 ; p = 0.018 ) in older adults (>= 65 years of age ) admitted to hospital for congestive heart failure ( chf ) , acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) , pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) [ 18 ] .
in the nourish study , all patients received standard nutritional care , regardless of whether they were in the intervention or control group .
administering hp - hmb also proved to be a cost - effective intervention in a study carried out in the usa , where incremental cost - effectiveness ratios ( icer ) were of us $ 33,818 per quality - adjusted life year ( qaly ) and $ 524 per year of life year gained ( lyg ) , respectively , using 90 - day and lifetime time horizons [ 19 ] .
the aim of this study is to determine whether administering hp - hmb would be cost - effective in patients admitted to spanish hospitals , using short , medium and long - term time horizons , applying the data from the nourish study to the spanish population .
2. patients and methods costs and effects of the nutritional intervention were assessed in a hypothetical cohort of patients with the baseline characteristics of the patients included in the nourish study [ 18 ] .
the mean age of the patients included in the nourish study was 78.1 in the control group and 77.7 in the hp - hmb group .
in the placebo group , 86.7 % of patients were mild - moderately malnourished ( sga b ) and 13.3 % were severely malnourished ( sga c ) ; whereas , in the hp - hmb group , the respective rates for mild - moderate and severe malnourishment were 87.9 % and 12.1 % , respectively .
the most frequent primary diagnosis was copd ( 34.1 % in the control group and 34.8 % in the hp - hmb group ) , followed by pneumonia ( 32.5 % and 30.4 %) , chf ( 25.3 % and 25.2 %) and ami ( 8.1 % and 9.6 %) [ 18 ] .
we carried out an incremental cost - effectiveness analysis to compare administering hp - hmb against not administering it , using life years gained ( lyg ) as the unit of effectiveness and replicating the methodology described by zhong et al .
[ 19 ] .
the cost - effectiveness analysis was carried out from the perspective of the spanish national health system ( sns ) using short ( 90 days post - discharge ) , medium ( 180 days , 1 year and 2 years post - discharge ) , and long - term ( 5 years post - discharge and lifetime ) time horizons .
this strategy , assumptions and data included in the analysis were validated by a panel of clinical experts .
2.1 .
method of estimating costs in estimating the costs , we included the costs resulting from nutritional intervention , from the index hospitalisation , from readmissions and from the use of other healthcare resources within the 90 days post - discharge ( including visits to the emergency room , visits to a specialist and to primary care centre / gp , or rehabilitation sessions ) .
all costs were expressed in euros ( year 2016 values ) .
the costs of the index hospitalisation and of readmissions were estimated based on the costs and mean length of hospital stays registered in the conjunto minimo basico de datos ( cmbd ) [ 20 ] .
the costs and mean length of stay for the index hospitalisations are shown in table 1 and table 2 .
the costs and mean length of readmissions are shown in table a1 ) .
in estimating the costs of other healthcare resources , the use of resources was determined based on frequencies observed in the nourish study and the unit costs for these resources were taken from the esalud database [ 21 ] .
the unit costs and use of resources used for the analysis are shown in table 1 and table 3 .
for patients treated with hp - hmb , the cost of nutritional intervention was estimated based on the manufacturer 's sale price ( pvl ) for one dose ( 220 ml ) of ensure plus advance ( r ) in spain ( euro3.828 ) and the number of doses per patient observed in the nourish study ( 94.19 doses / patient ) [ 18 ] .
the patients in the control group were considered to have an intervention cost of euro0 .
2.2 .
method of estimating effectiveness to estimate the lyg for the cost - effective analysis with a 90 - day time horizon , the survival outcomes observed after the first 90 - days post - discharge were taken from the nourish study [ 18 ] .
to estimate the lyg for analyses with time horizons over 90 days , we considered that survival after 90 days did not depend on the intervention received , and the mortality risk level for the general spanish population was applied , adjusted for sex and age [ 22 ] .
2.3 .
incremental cost - effectiveness analysis the icer was calculated as the ratio between the costs ( total of costs incurred during the index hospitalisation and during the 90 - days post - discharge ) and the lyg at various time horizons ( 90 days , 180 days , 12 months , 24 months , 5 years , and lifetime ) .
2.4 .
sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the cost - effectiveness assessments was carried out using the 90 - day and 180 - day time horizons .
in both cases , the effect of considering different treatment compliance rates (+/ - 10 % of the doses observed in the nourish study ) , different lengths of stay in hospital and readmissions (+/ - 10 % with respect to the values considered in the base case ) , different use of other resources (+/ - 10 % with respect to the values of the base case ) and the effect of considering only the difference in the cost due to the cost of the hp - hmb treatment ( namely , assuming the same use of healthcare resources in both groups ) , were assessed .
in addition , for the analyses carried out with time horizons of 90 days and 180 days , we estimated the effect on lyg considering the adjustment according to quality of life .
in this analysis , the same costs and estimations of lyg as for the incremental cost - effectiveness analysis were considered , and lyg were multiplied by a utility value between 0 and 1 ( death and perfect health , respectively ) to obtain estimated qaly and to estimate an incremental cost - effectiveness ratio .
to assess the effect of adjusting for lyg according to quality of life in the 90 - day time horizon , utilities were estimated using the results of the sf - 36 and eq - 5d questionnaires in the nourish study [ 19 ] .
for the estimation based on the sf - 36 questionnaire , we used the values observed in the nourish study .
for the estimation based on the eq - 5d questionnaire , we applied a correction factor to the values observed in the nourish study .
this factor was based on a comparison between the utility in the general population in the united states and the general population in spain , and was obtained following the methodology described by schousboe [ 23 ] .
in the 180 - day time horizon analysis , the same utility value was considered for all patients , regardless of whether they had received hp - hmb or not .
a utility value of 0.781 , equivalent to the eq - 5d health index for the general population in spain , in the age range between 75 and 84 years of age , was considered for both groups [ 24 ] .
3. results 3.1 .
cost analysis in patients who received hp - hmb , the total cost per patient was estimated at euro6705.56 , and for patients in the control group , the estimated cost was euro6372.82 per patient , as detailed in table 4 .
together , this is an estimated difference of euro332.75 per patient between the two groups , in favor of the control group .
the costs of intervention and the index hospitalisation were higher for the hp - hmb group than for the control group , whereas , the costs for readmissions and for the use of other healthcare resources in the 90 - day post - discharge period were higher in the control group ( table 4 ) .
the main causes of readmissions were chf , copd and aspiration pneumonia ( table a1 ) .
3.2 .
effectiveness in the 90 days post - discharge , the group treated with hp - hmb had a mortality rate of 4.8 % , which corresponds to a mean survival of 87.4 days ( 0.239 lyg ) , whereas the control group had a mortality rate of 9.7 % and a mean survival of 83.9 days ( 0.230 lyg ) .
the difference between both groups was 0.0096 lyg .
the estimations of lyg with the time horizons of 180 days , 1 year , 2 years , 5 years and lifetime are summarised in table 5 .
the differences between both groups varied between 0.024 lyg using the 180 - day time horizon and 0.590 lyg using the lifetime time horizon .
3.3 .
results of the cost - effectiveness analysis with a 90 - day time horizon in the base case analysis with a 90 - day time horizon , the incremental cost was euro332.75 , the incremental benefit was 0.0096 lyg and the icer was euro34,700.62 / lyg .
in the sensitivity analysis ( table 6 ) , the icer varied between euro30,941 / lyg and euro38,461 / lyg ; these values were obtained by considering , respectively , the use of a lower or higher number of doses than observed in the nourish study (+/ - 10 %) .
changes in the length of stay , the use of other resources and the unit costs had reduced impacts on the results of the analysis .
when considering the costs of hp - hmb alone , the icer was euro37,600.59 / lyg .
in the cost - utility analysis , when the utilities obtained from the sf - 36 questionnaire were considered , the estimated gains were 0.140 qaly for patients treated with hp - hmb and 0.129 qaly for patients not treated with this , resulting in a cost - utility ratio of euro30,249.61 / qaly .
however , when we considered the utilities taken from the eq - 5d questionnaire , we obtained a qaly of 0.147 for patients treated and 0.149 qaly for untreated patients in the control arm , and the nutritional intervention was a dominated option compared with the non - intervention .
3.4 .
analysis of cost - effectiveness with time horizons of over 90 days considering the incremental cost of euro332.75 , and considering the differences in lyg observed between both groups with the time horizons of 180 days , 1 year , 2 years , 5 years and lifetime , the respective icer were euro13,711.68 , euro3377.96 , euro2253.32 , euro1127.34 and euro563.84 / lyg ( table 5 ) .
in the sensitivity analysis of the analysis carried out with the 180 - day time horizon , the results varied between euro12,225.92 / lyg and euro15,197.44 / lyg ( table 6 ) , whereas , when we only considered the costs of the intervention , the icer was euro14,857.58 / lyg .
in the cost - utility analysis with the 180 - day time horizon , we observed a difference of 0.019 qaly between both groups , and the calculated cost was of euro17,557 / qaly .
4. discussion this is the first study that has assessed whether the use of ons is cost - effective in older adult patients admitted to spanish hospitals , during hospitalisation and 90 - days post - discharge .
the results obtained from our study are similar to those observed in a study carried out in the usa based on the results of the nourish [ 19 ] study and to those observed in other studies assessing the short - term cost - effectiveness of using ons [ 25,26 ] .
this study inherits some of the limitations of nourish study , such as its limited generalizability due to the inclusion of patients with a limited number of pathologies and its limited follow - up for clinical data ( of 90 days ) .
although the inputs from our study mostly correspond to the data collected as part of a clinical trial carried out in north american hospitals , the profile of the patients included in the nourish study are representative of those in an internal medicine unit in spain [ 7 ] ; therefore , to a certain extent , the results can be extrapolated to our environment .
not having data available on the use of resources for this type of patient in spanish hospitals is a limitation .
to mitigate this , we used data from the conjunto minimo basico de datos ( cmbd ) to estimate the length of hospital stays ( which in all cases were higher than those observed in the nourish study ) and we validated the use of other healthcare resources ( eliminating some of the resources used in the american study , such as admissions to long - stay facilities or to rehabilitation centers ) .
the effects of changing the length of stay and the use of resources were also assessed in the sensitivity analysis , in which modifications in the use of these resources did not have relevant impacts on the results .
as observed in the study published by zhong et al .
[ 19 ] , the difference in cost between both cohorts rests mainly with the cost of the treatment .
scenarios involving a 10 % increase or decrease in the number of doses compared with the base case were the ones with the greatest impact on the results , with differences of +/ - euro3700 / lyg compared with the base case using the 90 - day time horizon , and +/ - euro1500 / lyg using the 180 - day time horizon .
given that changes in adherence and compliance with the treatment could affect the validity of the results and the conclusions from this study , it would be appropriate to estimate these parameters in real clinical practice conditions .
this study shows that administering hp - hmb could be cost - effective for malnourished older adult patients admitted to spanish hospitals , particularly when considering medium and long - term time horizons , which would be the most suitable time horizons for recording the full - scale consequences resulting from this intervention , as recommended by the economic assessment guidelines [ 27 ] .
zhong et al .
[ 19 ] presented the results using two time horizons : 90 - days and lifetime .
we chose to present the results using different short , medium and long time horizons .
this has allowed us to verify that by extending the time horizon by just three months , in addition to the duration of the nourish study , the icer would be euro13,711.68 / lyg , a figure which would be below euro30,000 / lyg , a cost - effectiveness threshold commonly accepted in spain [ 28 ] .
using the lifetime horizon , the icer would be below euro600 / lyg , a similar result to that obtained by zhong et al .
[ 19 ] .
regarding the limitations of our study , in the estimates for medium and long - term survival , the likelihood of death after the 90 - day horizon was estimated using mortality rates for the general spanish population .
not having approximations of mortality rates for a population with features matching those of the clinical trial imposes a restriction .
however , considering that the spanish population aged >= 78 years of age ( mean age in the nourish study ) presents multiple comorbidities [ 18 ] , and that the majority of fatal events with causes linked to the index hospitalisation would have occurred during the first 90 days post - discharge ( and therefore were included in the analysis ) , we consider this is a reasonable approach .
another limitation is that we did not have the data that would allow us to estimate the use of resources beyond the 90 days outlined in the nourish study .
given that the costs derived from the use of healthcare resources during the 90 - days post - discharge ( readmissions and other resources ) were slightly higher in those patients belonging to the control group than in those in the hp - hmb group , it would be expected that these would continue to be somewhat higher in the control group than in the hp - hmb group , especially in the mid - term .
for this reason , to assume that , once past the 90 days , there were no differences in the use of resources between both groups , is a conservative assumption .
it should also be mentioned that the results of the nourish study showed uncertainty in assessing quality of life , since dissimilar results were observed when the sf - 36 and eq - 5d questionnaires were used .
in their base case analysis carried out at 90 days , zhong et al .
[ 19 ] calculated a cost - utility ratio considering the results from only the sf - 36 questionnaire , as they argued that the eq - 5d would not have sufficient granularity to assess quality of life changes for those patients included in the nourish study .
given the uncertainty regarding quality of life results , in our study , we chose to analyse the cost per lyg in the base case , and to assess the effect of potential adjustments depending on quality of life with both questionnaires in the sensitivity analysis .
in the analysis using a 90 - day time horizon , applying the utility obtained from the sf - 36 questionnaire gave an icer of around euro30,000 / qaly , whereas an adjustment based on the results from the eq - 5d resulted in the nutritional intervention being a dominated strategy .
in any case , the difference in qalys for patients receiving and not receiving hp - hmb was minimal , particularly when using the eq - 5d questionnaire ( 0.147 compared with 0.149 ) .
besides , because of the mortality advantage in patients treated with hp - hmb , the intervention would become cost - effective rather quickly , even when using eq - 5d data .
not having quality of life results beyond 90 days also constitutes a restriction .
assuming that quality of life would be similar in both cohorts , and applying a utility value of 0.781 to the lyg in the analysis carried out using the 180 - day time horizon , the intervention was still cost - effective , with an icer of less than euro20,000 / qaly .
even considering a scenario where the patient 's quality of life would be very much affected by their baseline comorbidities ( for example , assuming a utility value of 0.6 ) , the cost per qaly would still be below euro30,000 / qaly , with a value of euro22,853 / qaly .
despite the high prevalence of malnutrition , its clinical and financial consequences and recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of this condition in malnourished patients [ 29,30 ] , this is still an underdiagnosed and undertreated condition in spain .
observational studies carried out in spain have noted that only 5 % of hospital discharges recognise malnutrition as a diagnosis [ 6 ] , and only 25 % of malnourished patients receive any type of ons [ 5 ] .
therefore , it is necessary to implement measures to improve the diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition in specialised units .
in conclusion , the results of this analysis suggest that , for malnourished older adult patients admitted to spanish hospitals , administering hp - hmb during hospitalisation and in the 90 days post - discharge could be a cost - effective intervention that would improve survival with a reduced marginal cost .
these results should be confirmed in observational longitudinal studies .

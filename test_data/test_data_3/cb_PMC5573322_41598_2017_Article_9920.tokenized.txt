the fascinating interfacial transport properties at the laalo3 / srtio3 heterointerface have led to intense investigations of this oxide system .
exploiting the large dielectric constant of srtio3 at low temperatures , tunability in the interfacial conductivity over a wide range has been demonstrated using a back - gate device geometry .
in order to understand the effect of back - gating , it is crucial to assess the interface band structure and its evolution with external bias .
in this study , we report measurements of the gate - bias dependent interface band alignment , especially the confining potential profile , at the conducting laalo3 / srtio3 ( 001 ) heterointerface using soft and hard x - ray photoemission spectroscopy in conjunction with detailed model simulations .
depth - profiling analysis incorporating the electric field dependent dielectric constant in srtio3 reveals that a significant potential drop on the srtio3 side of the interface occurs within ~ 2 nm of the interface under negative gate - bias .
these results demonstrate gate control of the collapse of the dielectric permittivity at the interface , and explain the dramatic loss of electron mobility with back - gate depletion .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction since the discovery of a variety of interfacial electronic states between insulating and non - magnetic ( 001 ) - oriented laalo3 and srtio3 , such as high - mobility metallic states1 , superconductivity2 , 3 , and magnetism4 - 7 , the origin of these properties has been widely discussed8 , 9 .
given the robust insulating character of laalo3 , it is generally understood that the electron gas forms on the srtio3 side of the interface10 - 17 .
indeed , an in situ photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) study revealed downward band bending toward the interface in the srtio3 17 .
notable in this system is the dramatic tunability of the interfacial conductivity using external electric fields , attracting considerable attention for fundamental studies , as well as device applications18 , 19 .
the application of a back - gate voltage v g tunes multiple parameters in the system simultaneously , including the superconducting transition temperature , the carrier density , the hall mobility and the confining electric field3 , 18 , 20 - 23 .
in order to understand how these changes are inter - related , especially the dramatic loss of hall mobility with back - gate depletion20 , knowledge of the band alignment and potential profile changes with gating is essential .
in this study , we analyze the depth profile of the potential on the srtio3 side of laalo3 / srtio3 ( 001 ) heterojunctions using synchrotron radiation pes for various v g. a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig. 1. depth resolution was achieved by varying the energy of the synchrotron - radiation light source - both soft x - ray pes ( sx - pes ) and hard x - ray pes ( hax - pes ) were utilized - combined with precise tuning of the incident and emission angles24 .
analysis of the sx - pes and hax - pes core - level spectra with negative v g reveal an abrupt downward shift of the potential , narrowing the electron confinement to within ~ 2 nm of the laalo3 / srtio3 interface .
these results explain why back - gate depletion modulates the mobility far more strongly than the carrier density , and suggests this is a generic feature of nonlinear dielectrics that can be utilized in device structures .
figure 1 experimental setup for measurements of pes spectra for laalo3 / srtio3 heterostructures with applied electric field at the back of the srtio3 .
ground contact is made to the electron gas at the heterointerface using al wire bonding .
the photoelectron emission angle ( theta ) is defined as the angle from the surface normal .
results photoemission core - level spectroscopy of laalo3 / srtio3 the measured ti 2p core - level spectra of the laalo3 / srtio3 heterostructures at v g = 0 v and a bare srtio3 ( 001 ) substrate are shown in fig. 2. the characteristic probing depth lambda , based on the theoretical study of tanuma et al.25 , was tuned by changing the irradiation photon energy ( hnu ) and the photoelectron emission angle ( theta ) with respect to the surface normal .
hnu was 1.2 kev ( lambda = 2.0 nm for theta = 0 degree ) and 7.9 kev ( lambda = 10 nm for theta = 0 degree ) , theta was varied from 0 to 80 degrees ( also see fig. 1 ) .
the ti 2p core - level spectra from the laalo3 / srtio3 sample are shifted towards more positive relative binding energy from that of the bare srtio3 substrate with no observable ti3 + component , as previously found17 .
as the probing depth becomes shallower ( lambda < 10 nm ) , no significant peak shift or broadening characteristic to potential variation , was observed within the experimental resolution of 50 mev .
these results together with the gate - tunable transport properties20 imply that the potential profile varies on the scale of 10 nm or more in the srtio3 from the laalo3 / srtio3 heterointerface. by assuming that all carriers detected from hall effect under no applied bias ( n 2d ~ 2 x 1013 cm - 2 ) reside within 0.4 nm of srtio3 surface and fully contribute to the ti3 + signal , the estimated total volume of ti3 + is still below its practical detection limit of 2 ~ 3 at .
%. moreover , the possible carrier distribution , which is interrelated with the potential profile , experimentally prohibits the observation of any ti3 + states present .
figure 2 ti 2p core - level spectra of laalo3 / srtio3 heterostructures without bias gate voltage .
the relative binding energy is given with respect to the ti 2p core - level spectra of a bare srtio3 substrate as reference ( black line ) .
lambda is the probing depth controlled by photon energy and emission angle ; lambda = 1.6 and 10 nm are obtained by hax - pes ( hnu = 7.9 kev ) with theta = 80 and 0 degrees , respectively , while others ( lambda = 2.0 , 1.4 and 1.0 nm ) are sx - pes ( hnu = 1.2 kev ) results with varied angles at theta = 0 , 45 , and 60 degrees , respectively .
figure 3 show the measured ti 2p core - levels using ( a ) sx - pes and ( b ) hax - pes with - 100 v <= v g <= 100 v. for all v g , the gate leakage current through the srtio3 during the pes measurements was less than 10 na. the binding energy of the srtio3 core - level spectra were normalized to those of the laalo3 spectra , which minimizes possible artifacts from the pes measurements , such as fluctuations of the photon energy .
for negative v g , the ti 2p core - level first shifts to more positive relative binding energy from v g = 0 v before saturating at + 0.1 ~+ 0.2 ev in the case of sx - pes , while it remains unchanged for the hax - pes .
both sx - pes and hax - pes measurements show no ti 2p core - level shift for positive v g. similar results were also obtained in the sr 3d core - level measurements .
the change of the ti 2p core - level peak position are plotted as a function of v g in fig. 3 ( c ) and ( d ) , showing a total energy shift ~+ 0.15 ev for v g < 0 v for the sx - pes without any hysteresis .
figure 3 ti 2p core - level spectra of laalo3 / srtio3 heterostructures measured using ( a ) sx - pes ( hnu = 1.2 kev , theta = 0 degree ) and ( b ) hax - pes ( hnu = 7.9 kev , theta = 0 degree ) with applied gate voltage .
plots of relative binding energy ( b.e. ) shift between ( c ) ti 2p and la 4d core - level spectra ( filled circles ) , ti 2p and al 2p ( open triangles ) for sx - pes data , and ( d ) ti 2p and la 4d core level spectra ( filled circles ) from hax - pes data .
the error bars in ( c,d ) were obtained from the accuracy of the peak fitting .
the two sets of data points correspond to the forward and backward voltage sweeps to evaluate a possible hysteresis .
qualitatively we can examine these results by considering the simultaneous tuning of the sheet carrier density and the potential profile due to the application of negative v g. considering the srtio3 substrate as a capacitor dielectric between the back gate contact and the interface conducting layer , v g < 0 v corresponds to depletion of carriers at the interface resulting in a downward shift of the fermi energy ( e f ) towards the conduction band bottom .
at the same time however the band - bending is enhanced by the gating .
this shifts the center of the electron distribution closer to the interface .
for fixed sheet carrier density , n 2d , the increased confinement shifts e f upwards in energy , opposite to the effect of depletion .
since the sx - pes ti 2p core - level shifts to higher binding energy for v g < 0 v the band - bending induced upshift in e f is dominant .
indeed the dielectric constant of srtio3 at room temperature epsilon r ( t = 300 k )~ 350 , gives a total carrier density change of ~ 2 x 1010 cm - 2 for v g = - 50 v. this is just 0.14 % of the measured total hall sheet carrier density in this sample20 .
the magnitude of the energy shift clearly depends on the probing depth of the pes measurement compared to the characteristic length scale of the confinement potential narrowing .
hence the lack of an observable shift in the hax - pes data suggests that the most significant changes in the confining potential occur in the topmost layers of the srtio3 .
self - consistent simulation for the core - level spectra and potential profile in order to quantitatively analyze these scenarios , we simulated the potential profile in srtio3 as a function of the depth ( z ) from the interface based on a modified thomas - fermi screening model , using the pes data to constrain the results .
the scheme of self - consistent calculation is as follows : for a trial potential phi ( z ) , the carrier density profile n ( z ) is calculated using 1 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ n ( z )={\ int }_{{\ epsilon }= 0 }^{\ infty } d ({\ epsilon }) f ({\ epsilon }) d {\ epsilon },$$\ end { document } n ( z )= integralepsilon = 0infinityd ( epsilon ) f ( epsilon ) depsilon,where d (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ epsilon }$$\ end { document } epsilon ) is the density of states at electron energy \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ epsilon }$$\ end { document } epsilon from the conduction band minimum which is calculated via \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ d ({\ epsilon })={( 2 { m }^{\ ast }/{\ hslash }^{ 2 })}^{ 3 / 2 }{\ epsilon }{( z )}^{ 1 / 2 }/ 2 {\ pi }^{ 2 }$$\ end { document } d ( epsilon )=( 2m */ h2 ) 3 / 2epsilon ( z ) 1 / 2 / 2pi2 , where \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${ m }^{\ ast }$$\ end { document } m * is the effective mass of srtio3 , \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ hslash $$\ end { document } h is plank 's constant divided by 2pi , and \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\,{\ epsilon }( z )$$\ end { document } epsilon ( z ) is based on phi ( z ) 16 , and f (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ epsilon }$$\ end { document } epsilon ) is the fermi - dirac function .
following ref .
16 , we use the three - dimensional form of the density of states .
the potential is obtained by solving poisson 's equation 2 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ frac {\ partial }{\ partial z }({\ varepsilon }_{ 0 }{\ varepsilon }_{ r }({\ mathbb { e }})\ frac {\ partial {\ rm {\ phi }}( z )}{\ partial z })= - { e }_{ 0 } n ( z ).$$\ end { document } ddz ( epsilon0epsilonr ( e ) dphi ( z ) dz )= - e0n ( z ) .

here , we assumed other sources of charge , e.g. holes , extrinsic donors and acceptors , are negligible .
equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were solved self - consistently with a convergence criterion of 0.01 % throughout the whole depth region .
for each v g , the two boundary conditions used are phi ( z = 0 ) and \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ frac {\ partial {\ rm {\ phi }}( z )}{\ partial z }|\,$$\ end { document } dphi ( z ) dz | z = infinity .
the former is equal to the energy shift of the ti 2p core - level peak position in the sx - pes spectra at the appropriate v g 24 , and the latter is 0 v / m and 1 x 105 v / m , for v g = 0 and - 50 v respectively , given the 0.5 mm srtio3 substrate thickness .
in order to compare the experimentally obtained spectra with our model , we introduce an evaluation function known as the core - level intensity spectrum i ( e ) .
this is generally computed according to \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ i ( e )\ propto {\ sum }_{ z = 0 }^{\ infty }\ exp ( - z /\ lambda \,\ cos \,\ theta ) c [ e - { e }_{ 0 } - {\ rm {\ phi }}( z )],$$\ end { document } i ( e )~ sumz = 0infinityexp ( - z / lambdacostheta ) c [ e - e0 - phi ( z )] , where c ( e ) represents a core - level spectrum described by a voigt function peaked at e 0 , which in this case we set to zero as we are interested only in the relative change in the spectrum at different v g , not in the absolute value of e 0 24 .
the final best fit result is determined by minimizing the sum of the squares of the difference between the measured and calculated forms of the i ( e ) for both the sx - pes and hax - pes measurements .
the electric field (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e ) dependent local nonlinear permittivity of srtio3 , epsilon r (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e , z ) , must be considered as discussed in previous reports16 , 20 , 26 .
first we attempted to utilize the reported form of epsilon r (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e ) in our simulation ( fig. 4 ( c ) inset ) 27 .
however when n 2d was constrained to the measured value from hall effect20 , satisfactory agreement with the pes spectra was not possible .
even allowing n 2d to be a free parameter ( allowing for the possibility of localized charge not contributing to the hall measurement ) , no value could reasonably fit the spectra and other features such as the core - level shift in fig. 3 ( c ) ( see supplementary materials ) .
the key point is that the reported bulk form of epsilon r (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e ) did not accurately reproduce the nonlinearity of the dielectric permittivity inferred from the data .

as an alternative , we then assumed a smoothly varying dielectric constant as a function of distance from the interface epsilon r ( z ) for v g = 0 and - 50 v , based on a simple sigmoid function , which was used as a physically reasonable qualitative form .
the self - consistently solved potential and carrier density profiles are shown in fig. 4 ( a ) and ( b ) .
here the errors of the simulated parameters were estimated with a threshold of 3 % increase in the total squared error from the minimum value , except for the error in phi ( 0 ) which was directly taken from the experimental error in the pes spectra .
the comparison between the experimental spectra ( open symbols ) and the best - fit simulated spectra ( solid lines ) from the obtained potential profiles are shown in fig. 4 ( d ) and ( e ) .
good agreement is observed for both the sx - pes and hax - pes data .
the main panel of fig. 4 ( c ) shows the best fit epsilon r ( z ) for v g = 0 and - 50 v in these simulations , and the insets of fig. 4 ( c ) shows the extracted epsilon r (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e ). from these simulations , close to the interface , we find a relatively abrupt potential shift of ~ 0.15 ev inside the srtio3 for v g = - 50 v compared to v g = 0 v. as shown in the inset of fig. 4 ( a ) , the potential crosses e f around z = 6 nm and 2 nm for v g = 0 and - 50 v , the former is in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical estimates of the electron gas thickness being < 10 nm13 , 15 , 16 , 28 , 29 .
discussion experimentally a significant change of the potential around the interface occurred only for v g < 0 v , and not v g > 0 v. based on these calculation results , we can explain this asymmetry by considering the magnitude of \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e around z = 0 .
for v g = 0 v , \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e is not large enough to significantly reduce epsilon r , and positive v g only tends to decrease the interfacial electric field .
the resultant changes in the band - bending and position of e f are therefore relatively small and below the pes resolution .
this is in stark contrast to the case of v g < 0 v , where \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}( z = 0 )$$\ end { document } e ( z = 0 ) is large enough to reduce epsilon r , which self - consistently enhances the confinement leading to significant changes in the potential which are measurable by sx - pes .
quantitatively , the collapse of epsilon r with \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e obtained in the analysis above is more rapid than reported for non - doped srtio3 16 , 30 - 32 and nb doped srtio3 27 ; the latter being somewhat more strongly affected for a given \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e than the former one .
this has important implications for calculations of electron accumulation layers in any srtio3 - based heterostructure .
we note that our self - consistent approach is the same as the one of copie et al. , who utilized the literature form of epsilon r (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e ) 16 .
the epsilon r (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e ) relationship reported by yamamoto et al.27 has also been successfully used to model the depletion layer in metal / srtio3 schottky junctions33 .
an important difference between the schottky depletion layer and the laalo3 / srtio3 is the existence of free electrons in the latter , which can screen applied electric fields in addition to the lattice polarization which is the only possibility in the former .
indeed , a recent theoretical study has noted the interplay between electron density changes and lattice polarization34 .
in order to clarify these points , direct microscopic investigations of the lattice polarization with gate voltage are essential .
noting the large changes in potential over just a few lattice parameters , the failure of the prior experimental measurements of epsilon r (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e ) to capture our data likely reflect the need to explicitly consider epsilon r on short length scales , and include nonlocal effects35 , 36 .
in this sense , our model employing epsilon r ( z ) is one of the approximations implicitly incorporating the effect of k - dependence of epsilon r. despite the flexibility in the functional form of epsilon r , an abrupt drop in the potential at the interface is an essential feature required to reproduce our spectroscopic results .
finally we note the intriguing point that when the electric displacement field d (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e ) is calculated using the new functional form of epsilon r (\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e ) , \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mathbb { e }}$$\ end { document } e is multi - valued for 0.02 <= d <= 0.08 cm - 2 , as shown in fig. 4 ( f ) .
although the underlying physics and effects of such an electrostatic instability are currently not clear , it is possible that the presence of multiple metastable dielectric states in srtio3 close to the interface could induce local structural phase transitions37 and associated effects in resistive switching properties38 , in addition to creating an unstable potential profile at the interface .
the collapse of epsilon r around the interface , simultaneously enhancing the electron confinement and impurity scattering , especially at low temperatures , explains the substantial decrease in the mobility20 and enhanced localization37 that has been previously observed for back - gating .
the strong contrast with top - gating39 suggests that this nonlinear dielectric response provides new device switching approaches in oxide heterostructures .
methods the laalo3 / srtio3 was fabricated on tio2 - terminated srtio3 ( 001 ) substrates by pulsed laser deposition as described elsewhere20 .
during laalo3 depositions , the substrate was kept at a temperature of 800 degreesc , and the ambient oxygen pressure was maintained at 1 x 10 - 5 torr .
the laalo3 thickness is 10 unit cells (~ 4 nm ) , which is the identical sample used in our previous transport study using back - gate20 .
sx - pes and hax - pes synchrotron radiation measurements were carried out under applied v g at beamline bl2c of the photon factory , kek , japan and beamline bl47xu of spring - 8 , japan , respectively .
the sx - pes and hax - pes spectra were recorded using a scienta ses - 2002 electron energy analyzer , and a scienta r - 4000 electron energy analyzer , respectively .
all pes measurements were performed at room temperature .
a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig. 1. v g was applied from the back of the 0.5 mm thick srtio3 substrate during the pes measurements , with the laalo3 / srtio3 interface grounded using al wire bonding via a gold - coated copper plate .
the back of the srtio3 substrate was electrically contacted to this copper plate using silver epoxy .

apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) and apoe / amyloid - beta ( abeta ) transgenic ( tg ) mouse models are critical to understanding apoe - isoform effects on alzheimer 's disease risk .
compared to wild type , apoe - / - mice exhibit neuronal deficits , similar to apoe4 - tg compared to apoe3 - tg mice , providing a model for abeta - independent apoe effects on neurodegeneration .
to determine the effects of apoe on abeta - induced neuropathology , apoe - / - mice were crossed with abeta - tg mice , resulting in a significant delay in plaque deposition .
surprisingly , crossing human - apoe - tg mice with apoe - / - / abeta - tg mice further delayed plaque deposition , which eventually developed in apoe4 / abeta - tg mice prior to apoe3 / abeta - tg. one approach to address hapoe - induced temporal delay in abeta pathology is an additional insult , like head injury .
another is crossing human - apoe - tg mice with abeta - tg mice that have rapid - onset abeta pathology .
for example , because 5xfad mice develop plaques by 2 months , the prediction is that human - apoe / 5xfad - tg mice develop plaques around 6 months and 12 months before other human - apoe / abeta - tg mice .
thus , tractable models for human - apoe / abeta - tg mice continue to evolve .
1. introduction alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is the most common form of dementia and represents a serious economic and social burden worldwide .
the familial form of ad ( fad ) is caused by autosomal dominant mutations that increase levels of the 42 amino acid isoform of the amyloid - beta 42 ( abeta42 ) peptide [ 1 , 2 ] .
the primary genetic risk factor for ad is inheritance of the apoe4 gene for apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) , compared to apoe3 , with apoe2 reducing risk [ 3 - 5 ] .
the mechanism ( s ) by which apoe and abeta affect pathogenesis of the disease is unclear ( reviewed [ 3 - 5 ]) .
however , evidence suggests that apoe may isoform - specifically modulate abeta - induced neurotoxicity [ 4 , 5 ] .
to address potential mechanisms in vivo , several transgenic ( tg ) mouse models have been developed to assess the structural and functional interactions between apoe and abeta .
however , each of these models has potential drawbacks that affect the interpretation and physiological relevance of the results .
this paper will summarize the current models resulting from the introduction of human - apoe into abeta - tg mice .
the continued development and characterization of both apoe and apoe / abeta - tg mouse models is critical to understanding the apoe - isoform effects on ad pathology .
1.1 .
amyloid - beta traditional diagnosis of ad is based on pathology that includes extracellular amyloid plaques , composed primarily of abeta42 , intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles , hyperphosphorylated tau , neuroinflammation , and neuronal cell loss .
abeta is a 39 - 43 amino acid ( 4 kda ) peptide produced via sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein ( app ) by beta - secretase / bace followed by gamma - secretase ( composed of presenilins [ ps ] 1 and 2 ) , to produce abeta peptides primarily 40 and 42 amino acids in length .
genetic and experimental evidence indicates that abeta42 is the cause of ad pathogenesis [ 1 , 2 ] : ( 1 ) fad , although only 3 - 5 % of all ad cases is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in app , ps1 , or ps2 that increase levels of abeta42 or the abeta42 : 40 ratio ; ( 2 ) down syndrome is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 ( the location of the app gene ) , and is characterized by plaque deposition and dementia by the age 40 ; ( 3 ) abeta42 is neurotoxic in vitro and in vivo .
abeta , particularly the more toxic abeta42 , aggregates to form a variety of higher - order assemblies including oligomers , protofibrils , fibrils , and amyloid plaques [ 6 ] .
amyloid plaques themselves exist in different conformations including compact plaques ( composed of a dense thioflavin - s - ( thios - ) positive core ) , neuritic plaques ( identified as thios - positive plaques surrounded by a ring of dystrophic neurites ) , and diffuse plaques ( characterized by amorphous wisps of amyloid that lack a central core and are not neurotoxic ) [ 7 - 10 ] .
while total plaque burden does not directly correlate with dementia [ 11 ] , it is an indication of increased abeta42 levels , and compact or dense core plaques may be disease relevant [ 7 , 12 ] .
1.2 .
apoe apoe is the only apolipoprotein synthesized within the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) and is the primary apolipoprotein associated with lipoprotein particles in the central nervous system ( cns ) , as peripheral apoe is unable to cross the bbb or blood - cerebrospinal fluid barrier .
while the majority of apoe in the cns is secreted by glial cells , particularly astrocytes , neuronal production of apoe has been observed under specific pathological conditions [ 13 ] .
cns lipoproteins are critical for lipid homeostasis , particularly as cholesterol and phospholipids are required for neuronal growth , repair , and synaptogenesis ( reviewed [ 3 - 5 ]) .
in humans , three apoe polymorphic alleles exist ( apoe2 , apoe3 , and apoe4 ) which encode three protein isoforms ( apoe2 , apoe3 , and apoe4 ) .
although human - apoe ( h - apoe ) is a 299 amino acid protein , the three apoe - isoforms differ by a single amino acid substitution at residues 112 or 158 : apoe2 contains cys112,158 , apoe3 contains cys112arg118 , and apoe4 contains arg112,158 [ 5 ] .
in the general population , apoe3 is the most common allele ( 77 %) , followed by apoe4 ( 15 %) and apoe2 ( 8 %) .
in contrast , 40 % of ad patients express at least one apoe4 allele .
compared to apoe3 , inheritance of one or two copies of the apoe4 allele increases the risk for developing ad by 4 - and 12 - fold , whereas apoe2 decreases risk by 2 - and 4 - fold [ 5 , 14 ] .
amyloid plaque deposition is greatest in ad patients with an apoe4 allele ( s ) [ 14 ] .
in addition to ad , apoe4 is a risk factor for cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( caa ; amyloid deposition in blood vessels ) and impairs recovery from cerebral insults such as stroke , cerebral hemorrhage , and brain injury [ 4 ] .
while apoe knock - out mice ( apoe - / - ) and h - apoe - tg models demonstrate that apoe affects neuronal viability independent of abeta - induced neurotoxicity , the focus of this paper is on the synergism between the h - apoe isoforms and abeta on neuropathology .
to address the latter in vivo , apoe / abeta - tg models were subsequently developed to specifically address the isoform - specific effects of h - apoe on abeta deposition .
2. transgenic mice expressing human apoe ( table 1 ) several approaches have been used to make tg mouse models to assess the function of apoe .
apoe - / - tg - mice were initially used to help understand the role of apoe in the brain [ 15 , 16 ] although the homology between mouse ( m - ) and h - apoe is 70 % , and mice express only a single isoform , comparable to apoe4 at residues 112 and 158 [ 54 ] .
apoe - / - mice have been used as the background for several h - apoe - tg mouse lines .
heterologous promoters have been used to drive the expression of h - apoe in glia or neurons .
examples include glial fibrillar acidic protein ( gfap ; glial ) [ 22 , 55 - 57 ] , transferrin ( neuronal ) [ 58 ] , platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ; neuronal ) [ 59 ] , neuron - specific enolase ( nse ; neuronal ) [ 15 ] , and thymocyte differentiation antigen 1 ( thy1 ; neuronal ) [ 59 ] .
however , these models have limitations inherent in the use of a heterologous promoter and specific to apoe : ( 1 ) the expression of protein by a heterologous promoter is not regulated as it would be by the endogenous promoter ; ( 2 ) the inserted copy number of the transgene cannot be regulated by a traditional tg mouse approach ; ( 3 ) while the cell - specific expression of apoe in the brain is controversial [ 60 - 63 ] , the majority of evidence suggests that glia , not neurons , are the primary cell type to express apoe [ 13 , 64 - 67 ] ; ( 4 ) by using the m - apoe - / - background and inducing apoe expression via cns - specific promoters , lack of peripheral apoe becomes a variable of potential importance when interpreting results from these mice ; ( 5 ) evidence suggests that in both humans and apoe - tr mice , apoe4 levels are significantly lower than apoe2 or apoe3 [ 68 - 73 ] .
knock - in or targeted - replacement ( tr ) mice were developed that express h - apoe under the control of the endogenous mouse promoter and provide an alternative to heterologous expression of h - apoe .
in apoe - tr mice , the coding domain for each of the h - apoe isoforms replaces the coding domain for m - apoe .
thus , in apoe - tr mice , glial cells express h - apoe in a native conformation at physiologically regulated levels , and in the same temporal and spatial pattern as endogenous m - apoe .
thus , the interpretation of apoe isoform - specific results is determined by the nature of the apoe - tg mouse model .
as discussed , a number of apoe - tg mouse models have been developed with apoe expression under the control of different promoters [ 74 ] .
the general phenotypes of apoe - / - mice and three examples of the most widely studied apoe - tg mice ( gfap - apoe , nse - apoe , and apoe - tr ) are briefly discussed ( table 1 ) .
2.1 .
apoe - / - compared to wild type , apoe - / - mice have decreased excitatory transmission , spine density , and dendritic length [ 16 - 18 ] .
these changes may underlie behavioral deficits , as apoe - / - mice are cognitively impaired [ 15 , 19 , 20 ] .
however , lack of peripheral apoe can have profound effects on plasma lipid homeostasis , potentially leading to a number of confounding variables , including metabolic disease and increased risk for cardiovascular disease , compromising the ability to compensate for oxidative stress or inflammation , deficits that can effect the vasculature of the brain .
in addition , the relevance of these mice is unclear as there are no apoe - / - humans .
apoe - / - provides the background for a number of the h - apoe - tg mice .
2.2 .
gfap - apoe mice gfap is an intermediate filament protein , expressed at high levels by glia in the cns .
to target apoe expression to glia , mice expressing h - apoe under the control of the gfap promoter were crossed with apoe - / - mice [ 17 , 22 , 23 ] .
at the cellular level , gfap - apoe4 mice show increased ca1 cellular atrophy and decreased spine density compared to gfap - apoe3 mice [ 75 ] .
in addition , compared to gfap - apoe3 mice , gfap - apoe4 mice demonstrate impaired cognition and increased anxiety ; common symptoms in ad patients [ 17 , 23 , 24 ] .
interestingly , cognitive impairment is evident at an earlier age in female compared to male gfap - apoe4 mice [ 23 , 24 ] .
a limitation of this model is that the effect of apoe isoform on neuroinflammatory responses cannot be interpreted , as apoe is expressed under the control of a promoter that is induced by neuroinflammation .
2.3 .
neuronal apoe expression neuronal apoe expression remains controversial , although expression has been identified under conditions of stress [ 25 ] .
to investigate the role of neuronal expression , apoe - tg mice expressing h - apoe under the control of the nse promoter were crossed with apoe - / - mice [ 25 - 27 ] .
kainic acid was used to induce apoe expression in these mice and resulted in the protection of nse - apoe3 mice from age - and kainic acid - induced presynaptic and dendritic degeneration compared to nse - apoe4 mice [ 25 ] .
in addition , female nse - apoe4 mice demonstrate impaired cognition compared to female nse - apoe3 mice [ 25 ] .
in contrast , male nse - apoe4 mice do not exhibit cognitive deficits [ 15 ] .
thus , the effect of apoe4 on cognition may be modulated by gender .
this is similar to the early development of cognitive deficits in gfap - apoe4 .
2.4 .
apoe - tr to investigate the function ( s ) of apoe in a more physiologically relevant apoe - tg model , apoe - tr mice were developed to express each h - apoe isoform under the control of the endogenous m - apoe promoter [ 28 - 35 ] .
although apoe protein levels in brain homogenates of these mice were initially described as being similar for each h - apoe isoform [ 32 ] , subsequent analysis demonstrated that apoe4 levels are significantly lower in plasma , csf , and brain homogenates than apoe2 and apoe3 [ 28 , 30 ] , similar to the levels of apoe isoforms in humans [ 68 - 73 ] .
compared to apoe3 - tr mice , apoe4 - tr mice demonstrate decreased spine density and dendrite length , reduced excitatory transmission , and long - term potentiation ( table 1 ) .
again , similar to the cognitive deficits observed in female gfap - apoe4 mice and nse - apoe4 mice , female apoe4 - tr mice are cognitively impaired compared to female apoe3 - tr mice [ 31 , 32 ] .
however , male apoe3 - tr and apoe4 - tr mice are not significantly different .
interestingly , both apoe3 - and apoe4 - tr females are cognitively impaired when compared to apoe - isoform - matched males .
3. apoe in abeta transgenic models ( table 2 ) 3.1 .
abeta - tg although amyloid plaques are a hallmark of ad , the mechanisms underlying abeta - induced toxicity remain unknown .
to help determine the effects of abeta and amyloid deposition on neurotoxicity in vivo , abeta - tg mouse models have been produced that express human fad mutations .
these models include but are not limited to : pdapp ( appv717f ) , tg2576 ( appk670n , m671l ) , j9 ( ps1m146v,l286v , appv717f ) , as well as 5xfad ( appk670n , m671l,i716v,v717i , ps1m146v,l286v ) ( reviewed in [ 2 ]) .
these abeta - tg mice express either app mutations alone ( pdapp , tg2576 ) or in combination with ps mutations ( j9 , 5xfad ) .
plaque development generally begins at 6 months of age in these mice ( with the exception of 5xfad ) , and the onset of cognitive deficits is dependent on the model ( e.g. , pdapp at 6 months , tg2576 at 9 months ) .
because the appk670n , m671l mutation is linked primarily to caa , the tg2576 mice also develop abeta deposition around blood vessels , particularly leptomeningeal and cortical vessels .
however , one limitation of abeta - tg models is the relative lack of neuronal loss as observed in ad ( reviewed [ 76 ]) although there are some exceptions ( e.g. , 5xfad [ 49 ] , appslps1ki , and tba2 mice [ 76 ]) .
3.2 .
apoe - / - / abeta - tg initially , the effect of apoe on abeta deposition was investigated using apoe - / - crossed with abeta - tg mice ( table 2 ) .
specifically , apoe - / - mice were crossed with pdapp [ 77 - 79 ] or tg2576 mice [ 80 ] .
in both models , the absence of apoe significantly delayed thios - positive plaque deposition by 6 months and decreased abeta levels in the hippocampus and cortex , as measured biochemically from brain homogenates and by abeta immunoreactivity [ 42 , 77 ] ( table 2 ) .
apoe affects plaque deposition in a gene - dose - dependent manner , as plaque levels were intermediate in apoe +/ - / pdapp compared with apoe +/+/ pdapp and apoe - / - / pdapp mice [ 78 ] .
in addition , the abeta40 caa present in the tg2576 mice was absent in the apoe - / - / tg2576 mice [ 80 ] .
3.3 .
gfap - apoe / abeta - tg the initial studies demonstrating that the lack of m - apoe delayed plaque deposition in abeta - tg mice led to the question of what would be the effect of introducing h - apoe into apoe - / - / abeta - tg mice ( table 2 ) .
to initially address this issue , gfap - apoe mice was crossed with apoe - / - / pdapp mice [ 41 , 42 ] .
surprisingly , the introduction of h - apoe did not result in the expected reduction in the age of onset of abeta pathology , rather the presence of h - apoe further delayed abeta deposition .
amyloid accumulation is delayed from 6 to 12 months in apoe +/ - / pdapp mice , and to 15 months in gfap - apoe +/ - / pdapp mice ( table 2 ) .
once plaque pathology returned , the greatest plaque burden was found in gfap - apoe4 / pdapp mice , compared with gfap - apoe2 / pdapp and gfap - apoe3 / pdapp mice .
one potential confounding factor in these mice , as well as the nse - apoe mice described below , is the equal expression of the h - apoe isoforms , in contrast to human data where inheritance of an apoe4 allele results in lower apoe levels [ 68 , 69 , 73 ] .
3.4 .
neuronal apoe expression / abeta - tg to determine the effect of neuronal h - apoe expression on abeta pathology , nse - apoe were crossed with j9 mice ( ps1m146v,l286v , appv717f ) [ 81 ] .
similar to gfap - apoe / pdapp - tg mice , the introduction of h - apoe to j9 mice delayed plaque pathology from 8 to 19 months , with deposition greater in the nse - apoe4 / j9 than nse - apoe3 / j9 [ 26 ] .
3.5 .
apoe - tr / abeta - tg the physiologic advantages of using apoe - tr mice to study the function ( s ) of apoe in vivo led to the generation of apoe - tr / pdapp [ 30 ] and apoe - tr / tg2576 mice [ 47 ] ( table 2 ) .
the resulting data confirmed that h - apoe delayed plaque deposition .
in apoe - tr / pdapp mice , plaque deposition was delayed from 6 months to 18 months of age .
an apoe isoform - specific effect on abeta pathology was also observed , with thios staining , abeta immunoreactivity , and abeta levels in brain homogenates highest with apoe4 [ 30 ] .
in tg2576 mice , plaque deposition initiates at 9 months of age , while in apoe - tr / tg2576 mice there is minimal plaque staining at 15 months .
interestingly , at 15 months , the isoform effect in these mice is primarily on caa ( e4 > e3 ) , as amyloid deposition in the parenchyma is minimal [ 47 ] .
3.6 .
addressing h - apoe - induced delay in abeta pathology the major drawback to the apoe / abeta - tg crosses described thus far is the significant h - apoe - induced delay in abeta pathology .
for example , in apoe - tr / pdapp mice , plaque deposition is not identified until mice are >= 18 months of age ( table 2 ) .
this substantial delay precludes timely analyses of apoe isoform - specific effects on early aspects of abeta pathology .
one approach to address this temporal delay is to introduce an additional insult , such as traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) [ 82 ] , kainic acid [ 25 ] , nitric - oxide - synthase - 2 - ( nos2 - ) knock - out [ 83 ] , or by blocking abeta degradation via neprilysin inhibition [ 84 ] .
although no amyloid deposition is present in 12 - month - old gfap - apoe / pdapp mice , tbi at 9 months leads to amyloid deposition at 12 months [ 82 ] , which is greater with apoe4 compared to apoe3 .
kainic acid decreases synaptophysin and map - 2 staining in apoe - / - and nse - apoe tg mice , with the effect more pronounced with apoe4 than apoe3 .
nitric oxide , produced by inducible nos ( encoded for by the nos2 gene ) , is an important signaling and redox factor that plays a key role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration [ 83 ] .
nos2 - / - mice have been crossed with multiple abeta - tg mouse models , and results demonstrate increased tau phosphorylation and neuronal loss in nos2 - / - / abeta - tg mice [ 83 ] .
in the tg2576 / nos2 - / - mice , abeta deposition is higher compared to tg2576 mice .
inhibition of neprilysin , an enzyme that degrades extracellular abeta , with thiorphan , induces fibrillization and deposition of abeta and in wild - type mice .
thiorphan treatment of apoe - tr mice leads to aggregation of mouse abeta 1 week after treatment , with higher abeta deposition in apoe4 - tr compared to apoe3 - tr mice [ 84 , 85 ] .
thus , thiorphan treatment of h - apoe - abeta - tg mice represents a potential method of accelerating human abeta deposition .
an alternative method to address the h - apoe - induced temporal delay in abeta accumulation is to cross apoe - tr mice with abeta - tg mice that have rapid - onset abeta pathology , such as 5xfad [ 49 ] , 3xtr [ 86 , 87 ] , appslps1ki [ 88 ] , appps1 [ 89 ] , or tgcrnd [ 90 ] .
for example , because 5xfad mice develop plaques by 2 months , the prediction is that apoe - tr / 5xfad - tg mice develop plaques around 6 months and 12 months before other human - apoe / abeta - tg mice ( ladu lab , unpublished observations and [ 50 - 53 ]) .
the approaches described herein will lead to more tractable apoe / abeta - tg - models to assess the apoe isoform - specific effects on abeta pathology .
4. concluding remarks apoe is the greatest risk factor for ad. apoe - / - mice exhibit neuronal and cognitive deficits .
human apoe - tg mouse models demonstrate that , compared to apoe3 , apoe4 increases markers of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment .
initially , to determine the effect of apoe on abeta pathology , abeta - tg mice were crossed with apoe - / - mice , resulting in a significant delay in plaque deposition .
surprisingly , the introduction of h - apoe to several apoe - / - / abeta - tg mouse models further delayed plaque deposition .
this temporal delay restricts the usefulness of the current apoe / abeta - tg mice for investigating the process of abeta accumulation and the resulting neurotoxicity .
to accelerate abeta deposition , current apoe / abeta - tg models could be treated with an additional insult such as tbi , crossed with other tg models of neurodegeneration ( nos2 - / - ) , or treated with drugs that decrease abeta degradation .
alternatively , the development of abeta pathology could be accelerated by crossing abeta - tg models with a rapid onset of abeta pathology , such as 5xfad mice with apoe - tr mice .
transgenic models such as these provide tractable models for identifying biomarkers and the efficient initial validation of therapeutic targets .

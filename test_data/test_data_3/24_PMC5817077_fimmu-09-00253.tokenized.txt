type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) is a metabolic disease caused by the autoimmune destruction of insulin - producing beta - cells. with its incidence increasing worldwide , to find a safe approach to permanently cease autoimmunity and allow beta - cell recovery has become vital .
relying on the inherent ability of apoptotic cells to induce immunological tolerance , we demonstrated that liposomes mimicking apoptotic beta - cells arrested autoimmunity to beta - cells and prevented experimental t1d through tolerogenic dendritic cell ( dc ) generation .
these liposomes contained phosphatidylserine ( ps ) - - the main signal of the apoptotic cell membrane - - and beta - cell autoantigens .
to move toward a clinical application , ps - liposomes with optimum size and composition for phagocytosis were loaded with human insulin peptides and tested on dcs from patients with t1d and control age - related subjects .
ps accelerated phagocytosis of liposomes with a dynamic typical of apoptotic cell clearance , preserving dcs viability .
after ps - liposomes phagocytosis , the expression pattern of molecules involved in efferocytosis , antigen presentation , immunoregulation , and activation in dcs concurred with a tolerogenic functionality , both in patients and control subjects .
furthermore , dcs exposed to ps - liposomes displayed decreased ability to stimulate autologous t cell proliferation .
moreover , transcriptional changes in dcs from patients with t1d after ps - liposomes phagocytosis pointed to an immunoregulatory prolife .
bioinformatics analysis showed 233 differentially expressed genes .
genes involved in antigen presentation were downregulated , whereas genes pertaining to tolerogenic / anti - inflammatory pathways were mostly upregulated .
in conclusion , ps - liposomes phagocytosis mimics efferocytosis and leads to phenotypic and functional changes in human dcs , which are accountable for tolerance induction .
the herein reported results reinforce the potential of this novel immunotherapy to re - establish immunological tolerance , opening the door to new therapeutic approaches in the field of autoimmunity .
immunotherapy autoimmunity human type 1 diabetes liposomes tolerance dendritic cells introduction type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) mellitus is a metabolic disease caused by loss of tolerance to self and consequent autoimmune destruction of insulin - producing pancreatic beta - cells ( 1 ) .
when beta - cell mass decreases significantly , the individual 's endogenous production of insulin is no longer able to meet metabolic demands , leading to overt hyperglycemia .
upon diagnosis , patients with t1d require exogenous insulin administration , and although this treatment has allowed them to survive , long - term complications due to glycemic imbalances are bound to arise ( 2 , 3 ) .
t1d usually appears during childhood or adolescence , and its incidence is increasing an average of 4 % per year ( 4 ) .
despite knowing that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its development , triggering events remain elusive .
the autoimmune attack against beta - cells is led by a mild leukocytic infiltrate - - insulitis - - consisting of dendritic cells ( dcs ) , macrophages , t and b lymphocytes , and natural killer cells , which gradually advance through the islets ( 5 ) .
the first islet - infiltrating cells are dcs ( 6 ) , which orchestrate the loss of tolerance to beta - cell autoantigens , insulin being a key autoantigen in human t1d ( 7 ) .
the first step to revert t1d would be to arrest the pathological recognition of beta - cell autoantigens .
many immunotherapies have prevented and even reverted t1d in animal models ( 8 ) , but clinical trials have corroborated how challenging t1d prevention and reversion is , and most of them have been unsuccessful ( 9 ) .
in this scenario , the development of new therapies to halt autoimmunity in t1d has become an urgent biomedical matter .
an ideal immunotherapy should restore tolerance to beta - cells , avoiding systemic side effects , and allow islet regeneration .
one of the most efficient physiological mechanisms for inducing tolerance is apoptosis , a form of programmed cell death lacking inflammation .
the uptake of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes such as macrophages and immature dcs ( idcs ) is named efferocytosis ( 10 ) .
the exposure of " eat - me " signals on the apoptotic cell surface is what promotes their specific recognition and phagocytosis .
phosphatidylserine ( ps ) , a phospholipid usually kept in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane , is a relevant signal for efferocytosis .
this molecule is recognized by multiple distinct receptors on antigen presenting cells , including members of the tim family , stabilin - 2 , integrins , cd36 , cd68 , among others , as well as by soluble receptors that in turn bind to membrane receptors ( 11 ) .
after the capture , the apoptotic cell is processed , thus prompting the release of anti - inflammatory signals and presentation of autoantigens in a tolerogenic manner by dcs ( 12 ) .
failure of this mechanism , owing to an increase of apoptotic beta - cells or defects in efferocytosis , contributes to the loss of tolerance to self in the context of t1d ( 13 ) .
our group demonstrated that dcs acquired a tolerogenic phenotype and functionality after engulfment of apoptotic beta - cells , and that they prevented t1d when transferred to non - obese diabetic ( nod ) mice ( 14 , 15 ) .
however , since finding a substantial source of autologous apoptotic beta - cells for t1d immunotherapy would be impossible , we conceived an immunotherapy based on biomimicry that consisted of liposomes - - phospholipid bilayer vesicles - - displaying ps in their surface and containing autoantigenic peptides , thus resembling apoptotic cells .
indeed , apoptotic mimicry performed by ps - liposomes successfully restored tolerance to beta - cells in experimental autoimmune diabetes , preventing disease development and decreasing the severity of insulitis ( 16 ) .
moreover , by only replacing the autoantigenic peptide encapsulated within ps - liposomes , we confirmed the potential of this immunotherapy to prevent and ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , the experimental model of multiple sclerosis ( 17 ) .
in both cases , we demonstrated that phagocytosis of autoantigen - loaded ps - liposomes induced a tolerogenic phenotype and functionality in dcs , expansion of regulatory t cells and release of anti - inflammatory mediators that are responsible for arresting the autoimmune attack to target cells .
therefore , ps - liposomes could constitute a platform serving as a physiological and safe strategy to restore peripheral tolerance in antigen - specific autoimmune diseases .
liposomes , already used clinically as drugs deliverers for antitumor drugs and as vaccines ( 18 ) , have the advantage of being safe and biocompatible , customizable , easily large - scale produced , and standardizable .
aiming for the clinical potential of this strategy , we have encapsulated human insulin peptides to assess the effect of ps - liposomes in human dcs from patients with t1d and control subjects in vitro .
we herein report that ps - liposomes are efficiently captured by human dcs , thus eliciting transcriptomic , phenotypic , and functional changes that point to tolerogenic potential .
this immunotherapy constitutes a promising strategy to arrest autoimmune aggression in human t1d , benefiting from the co - delivery of tolerogenic signals and beta - cell autoantigens .
materials and methods patients patients with t1d ( n = 34 ) and control subjects ( n = 24 ) were included in this study .
all patients with diabetes fulfilled the classification criteria for t1d .
inclusion criteria were 18 - 55 years of age , a body mass index ( bmi ) between 18.5 and 30 kg / m2 and , for patients with t1d , an evolution of the disease longer than 6 months .
exclusion criteria were : being under immunosuppressive or anti - inflammatory treatment , or undergoing pregnancy or breastfeeding .
for the rna - sequencing ( rna - seq ) experiment , we selected 8 patients of the 34 that participated in the study , but bmi was limited to a maximum of 24.9 kg / m2 , duration of the disease was restricted to a maximum of 5 years ( in order to minimize the effect that long - term hyperglycemia could have on genetic and / or epigenetic profiles ) and the presence of other chronic diseases became an exclusion criterion .
all study participants gave informed consent , and the study was approved by the committee on the ethics of research of the germans trias i pujol research institute and hospital .
cell separation and generation of dcs peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) were obtained from 50 ml blood samples of control subjects and patients with t1d by means of ficoll paque ( ge healthcare , marlborough , ma , usa ) density gradient centrifugation .
monocytes were further magnetically isolated using the easysep human cd14 positive selection kit ( stemcell technologies , vancouver , bc , canada ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
once cd14 purity in the positively selected fraction was > 70 % , monocytes were cultured at a concentration of 106 cells / ml in x - vivo 15 media ( lonza , basel , switzerland ) , supplemented with 2 % male ab human serum ( biowest , nuaille , france ) , 100 iu / ml penicillin ( normon sa , madrid , spain ) , 100 mug / ml streptomycin ( laboratorio reig jofre , sant joan despi , spain ) , and 1,000 iu / ml il - 4 and 1,000 iu / ml gm - csf ( prospec , rehovot , israel ) to obtain monocyte - derived dcs .
after 6 days of culture , dc differentiation yield was assessed by cd11c - apc staining ( immunotools , friesoythe , germany ) and cell viability was determined by annexin v - pe ( immunotools ) and 7aad staining ( bd biosciences , san jose , ca , usa ) using flow cytometry ( facs canto ii , bd biosciences ) .
the negatively selected fraction of pbmcs was cryopreserved in fetal bovine serum ( thermofisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) with 10 % dimethylsulfoxide ( sigma - aldrich , saint louis , mo , usa ) and stored for later use .
peptide selection and preparation of liposomes thinking in a future clinical application of liposomes , the two chains of insulin were selected to be encapsulated separately in order to avoid possible biological effects of insulin .
a and b chains of insulin contain well - known beta - cell specific target epitopes in human t1d ( 19 ) .
peptide a corresponds to the whole human insulin a chain ( 21 aa , n - start - giveqcctsicslyqlenycn - c - end ) , and peptide b is the whole human insulin b chain ( 30 aa , n - start - fvnqhlcgshlvealylvcgergffytpkt - c - end ) ( genosphere biotechnologies , paris , france ) .
peptides were > 95 % pure and trifluoroacetic acid was removed .
liposomes consisted of 1,2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - l - serine ( sodium salt ) ( lipoid , steinhausen , switzerland ) , 1,2 - didodecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( lipoid ) , and cholesterol ( sigma - aldrich ) .
liposomes were prepared using the thin film hydration method from a lipid mixture of 1,2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - l - serine , 1,2 - didodecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine and cholesterol at 1:1:1.33 molar ratio , respectively , as described ( 20 ) .
liposomes without ps were generated as controls with 1,2 - didodecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine and cholesterol at 1:1 molar ratio .
all liposomes were produced under sterile conditions and at a final concentration of 30 mm. lipids were dissolved in chloroform and the solvent was removed by evaporation under vacuum and nitrogen .
the lipids were hydrated with the appropriate buffer ( phosphate buffered saline or 0.5 mg / ml solution of peptide a or peptide b ) and the liposomes obtained were homogenized to 1 mum by means of an extruder ( lipex biomembranes inc. , vancouver , bc , canada ) .
peptide encapsulation efficiencies were calculated according to the equation : encapsulation efficiency (%) = [( cpeptide,total - cpeptide,out )/ cpeptide,total ] x100 , where cpeptide,total is the initial peptide a or peptide b concentration and cpeptide,out is the concentration of non - encapsulated peptide .
to measure the cpeptide,out , liposome suspensions were centrifuged at 110,000 g at 10degreesc for 30 min .
the concentration of non - encapsulated peptide was assessed in supernatants by pierce bca protein assay kit ( thermofisher scientific ) .
in addition to ps - rich liposomes loaded with insulin peptides [ psa - liposomes ( n = 3 ) and psb - liposomes ( n = 3 ) encapsulating peptide a or peptide b , respectively ] , fluorescent - labeled liposomes with ps ( empty fluorescent ps - liposomes , n = 4 ) and without ps ( empty fluorescent pc - liposomes , n = 4 ) were also prepared using lipid - conjugated fluorescent dye oregon green 488 1,2 - dihexadecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) and following the aforementioned methodology .
particle size distributions and stability - - expressed as zeta potential ( zeta ) - - were measured by dynamic light scattering using malvern zetasizer ( malvern instruments , malvern , uk ) in undiluted samples .
liposome morphology and lamellarity were examined by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy ( cryo - tem ) in a jeol - jem 1400 microscope ( jeol ltd. , tokyo , japan ) .
phagocytosis assay to assess whether dcs were able to phagocyte liposomes , dcs were co - cultured with 100 mum of empty fluorescent ps - liposomes ( n = 5 for control subjects and n = 10 for patients with t1d ) or empty fluorescent pc - liposomes ( n = 6 for control subjects and n = 9 for patients with t1d ) at 37degreesc from 5 min to 24 h. as control , the same assay was performed at 4degreesc to confirm that liposomes were captured by an active mechanism of phagocytosis .
cells were extensively washed in cold phosphate buffered saline to remove all liposomes attached to the cell membrane .
liposome uptake was determined by flow cytometry ( facscanto ii , bd biosciences ) .
assessment of dcs phenotype after liposome uptake although insulin chains were encapsulated separately , dcs were stimulated by a mixture of psa - liposomes ( 50 %) and psb - liposomes ( 50 %) , in order to assess the effect of the whole insulin molecule as autoantigen .
thus , dcs from control subjects ( n >= 5 ) and patients with t1d ( n >= 8 ) were co - cultured with 1 mm of liposomes ( psab - dcs ) for 24 h in the presence of 20 mug / ml human insulin ( sigma - aldrich ) , and their viability and phenotype were analyzed by flow cytometry ( facscanto ii , bd biosciences ) .
the sample number stated ( n ) is referred to the minimum number of control subjects and patients included in each experiment .
as controls , dcs were either cultured with 20 mug / ml human insulin ( sigma - aldrich ) to obtain idcs or adding a cytokine cocktail ( cc ) consisting of tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) alpha ( 1,000 iu / ml , immunotools ) , il - 1beta ( 2,000 iu / ml , immunotools ) and prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 , 1 mum , cayman chemical , ann arbor , mi , usa ) for 24 h to obtain mature dcs ( mdc ) .
moreover , psab - dcs were cultured after phagocytosis with cc for 24 h in order to assess the response in front a pro - inflammatory stimulus ( mpsab - dcs ) .
phenotyping was performed as follows : dcs were stained with 7aad ( bd biosciences ) and monoclonal antibodies to cd11c - apc , cd25 - pe , cd86 - fitc , hla class i - fitc , hla class ii - fitc , cd14 - pe and cd40 - apc ( immunotools ) , cd36 - apccy7 , tim4 - apc , alphavbeta5 integrin - pe , cd54 - pecy7 , tlr2 - fitc , cxcr4 - apccy7 , ccr2 - apc , dc - sign - apc ( biolegend , san diego , ca , usa ) and ccr7 - pecy7 ( bd biosciences ) .
corresponding fluorescence minus one staining was used as control .
data were analyzed using flowjo software ( tree star inc. , ashland , or , usa ) .
t cell proliferation assays autologous t lymphocyte proliferation ( n = 12 for control subjects and n >= 12 for patients with t1d ) was assessed by exposing pbmcs to the different conditions of dcs used in this study .
briefly , pbmcs from the same donor were thawed and stained with 0.31 mum celltrace violet ( 21 ) ( thermofisher scientific ) according to manufacturer 's instructions .
the pbmcs were then co - cultured with idcs , psab - dcs , mpsab - dcs or mdcs at a 10:1 ratio ( 105 pbmcs : 104 dcs ) .
for each donor , 105 pbmcs were cultured in basal conditions as a negative control or with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( 50 ng / ml , sigma - aldrich ) and ionomycin ( 500 ng / ml , sigma - aldrich ) as a positive control .
after 6 days of co - culture , proliferation was assessed in the different t cell subsets with cd3 - pe , cd4 - apc and cd8 - fitc staining ( immunotools ) by flow cytometry ( facs lsr fortessa , bd biosciences ) .
data were analyzed using flowjo software ( tree star inc. ) .
cytokine production the human th1 / th2 / th17 kit ( cba system ; bd biosciences ) was used to assess cytokine production .
culture supernatants from dcs and from t cell proliferation assays ( n >= 3 for control subjects and n >= 3 for patients with t1d ) were collected and frozen at - 80degreesc until use .
il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 6 , ifn - gamma , tnf , il - 17a , and il - 10 were measured .
data were analyzed using cba software .
the production of human tgf - beta1 by dcs after psab - liposome uptake was determined by elisa ( ebioscience , san diego , ca , usa ) .
rna - seq of dcs before and after liposome phagocytosis dendritic cells obtained from patients with t1d ( n = 8 ) were cultured in basal conditions ( idcs ) or with 1 mm of psa - liposomes and psb - liposomes ( psab - dcs ) at 37degreesc for 4 h. cells were then harvested from culture wells using accutase ( ebioscience ) , and viability and dc purity were assessed with 7aad ( bd biosciences ) , annexin v - pe and cd11c - apc ( immunotools ) staining by flow cytometry ( facs canto ii , bd biosciences ) .
liposome capture control assays were performed for every sample ( see above phagocytosis assay section ) to confirm phagocytosis .
supernatant was removed and cell pellets were stored at - 80degreesc until use .
rna was extracted using rneasy micro kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) and following manufacturer 's instructions .
rna purity , integrity and concentration were determined by nanodrop ( nd - 1000 spectrophotometer , thermofisher scientific ) and 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies inc. , santa clara , ca , usa ) .
afterward , 1 mug of total rna was used to prepare rna libraries following the instructions of the nebnext ultra directional rna library prep kit ( new england biolabs , ipswich , ma , usa ) .
library quality controls were assessed using a tapestation 2200 ( agilent high sensitivity screen tape ) and a narrow distribution with a peak size of approximately 300 bp was observed in all cases .
libraries were quantified by qpcr using a qc kapa kit ( hoffman - laroche , basel , switzerland ) sequenced in a nextseq 500 genetic analyzer ( sbs - based sequencing technology , illumina , san diego , ca , usa ) in a run of 2 x 75 cycles and a high output sequencing mode .
twenty million reads were obtained and analyzed for each sample .
fastq files coming from illumina platform were merged and basic quality controls were performed with fastqc and prinseq tools .
paired - end ( forward - reverse ) sample merging was carried out with software clcbio genomics workbench ( r ) version 8.5 ( 22 ) , following the rna - seq analysis pipeline found in clcbio manuals .
read alignment and mapping steps to only gene regions were performed using clcbio software against the human genome ( homo sapiens grch38 assembly , at both gene - and transcript - level tracks ) .
the same software , with default options , was used to normalize counts by applying standard " reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped " method .
the remaining steps of the analysis were carried out with scripts and pipelines implemented with r software ( 23 ) .
the selection of differentially expressed genes ( degs ) was performed using the linear model approach implemented in the limma bioconductor package ( 24 ) , with previous log2 - transformation of the normalized data .
adjusted p values of <= 0.125 , taking into account multiple testing with the false discovery rate method , were considered significant .
therefore , genes with a p value < 0.0013 and log2 of fold change > 0.05 were considered upregulated , whereas those with log2 of fold change < 0.05 were considered downregulated .
experimental data have been uploaded into european nucleotide archive ( ebi , https :// www.ebi.ac.uk / ena ; accession number : prjeb22240 ) .
degs were categorized using ingenuity pathway analysis software ( qiagen ) , protein analysis through evolutionary relationships classification system ( 25 ) , reactome pathway database ( 26 ) and gene ontology biological process database ( 27 ) .
furthermore , r software ( 23 ) was used to generate a gene heatmap of degs .
quantitative rt - pcr to validate transcriptome results , dcs obtained from patients with t1d ( n >= 4 ) and control subjects ( n >= 3 ) were cultured and pelleted in three conditions : idcs , psab - dcs and mdcs .
rna was isolated using rneasy micro kit ( qiagen ) , and was reverse - transcribed with a high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit ( thermofisher scientific ) .
cdna synthesis reactions were carried out using random hexamers ( 0.5 mg / ml , biotools , valle de tobalina , madrid , spain ) and reverse transcriptase moloney - murine - leukemia - virus ( 200 u / ml , promega , madison , wi , usa ) .
quantitative rt - pcr assays were performed with taqman universal assay ( thermofisher scientific ) on a lightcycler ( r ) 480 ( roche , mannheim , germany ) using the following taqman assays : cyth4 ( hs01047905 _ m1 ) , gimap4 ( hs01032964 _ m1 ) , hpgd ( hs00960590 _ m1 ) , nfkb inhibitor alpha ( nfkbia ) ( hs00153283 _ m1 ) , plaur ( hs00958880 _ m1 ) , tnfaip3 ( hs00234713 _ m1 ) , tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14 ( tnfsf14 ) ( hs00542477 _ m1 ) , and vegfa ( hs00900055 _ m1 ) .
relative quantification was performed by normalizing the expression for each gene of interest to that of the housekeeping gene gapdh ( hs02758991 _ g1 ) , as described in the 2 - deltact method ( 28 ) .
statistical analysis the statistical analysis was performed using prism 7.0 software ( graphpad software inc. , san diego , ca , usa ) .
analysis of variance ( anova ) was used for comparisons with several factors .
for comparisons of unpaired data , a non - parametric mann - whitney test was used ; for paired comparisons , a non - parametric wilcoxon test was used .

ps - liposomes show multivesicular vesicle morphology and encapsulate insulin peptides liposomes were characterized in terms of diameter , polydispersity index ( pdi ) , surface charge ( zeta - potential ) and efficiency of peptide encapsulation ( table 4 ) .
all liposomes had a final lipid concentration of 30 mm. all liposomes were large to guarantee efficient phagocytosis , displaying a diameter superior to 690 nm. the presence of ps molecules in liposomes was confirmed by the negative charge measured at the liposome surface by zeta - potential ( - 38 mv ) .
regarding specific features of psa - liposomes ( n = 3 ) , the mean diameter was 690 +/ - 29 nm ( mean +/ - sd ) , the pdi was 0.40 +/ - 0.28 and the zeta - potential was - 38.57 +/ - 6.76 mv. the mean of peptide a ( human insulin a chain ) encapsulation efficiency was 39.74 +/ - 22.10 % .
as for psb - liposomes ( n = 3 ) , they had a mean diameter of 788 +/ - 264 nm , the pdi was 0.52 +/ - 0.42 and the zeta - potential was - 37.50 +/ - 7.16 mv , and the mean of peptide b ( human insulin b chain ) encapsulation efficiency was 93.19 +/ - 0.92 % .
differences in peptide encapsulation efficiency ( psa vs. psb ) are due to amino acid composition and different solubility of insulin chains a ( 21 aa ) and b ( 30 aa ) in phosphate buffered saline media .
b chain is more positively charged than a chain at neutral ph , resulting in a higher encapsulation efficiency in negatively charged liposomes .
psa - liposomes and psb - liposomes presented multivesicular vesicle morphology when cryo - tem analysis was performed ( figure 1 ) .

fluorescent - labeled ps - liposomes ( n = 4 ) showed a diameter of 836 +/ - 217 nm , a pdi of 0.32 +/ - 0.06 and a zeta - potential of - 38.90 +/ - 2.52 mv. their ps - free counterparts , fluorescent pc - liposomes ( n = 4 ) , had a diameter of 1665 +/ - 488 nm , a pdi of 0.32 +/ - 0.09 and a zeta - potential of - 7.60 +/ - 2.68 mv ( table 4 ) .
human dcs display optimal kinetics of ps - liposomes phagocytosis without affecting viability a time course analysis was performed to determine ps - liposomes uptake kinetics ( figure 2a , upper left panel ) .
the capture of empty fluorescent ps - liposomes by dcs was significantly higher at 37degreesc when compared to 4degreesc ( p < 0.001 ) , coming from either control subjects ( n = 5 ) or patients ( n = 10 ) .
this result is immunologically crucial and demonstrates that dcs engulf liposomes by an active mechanism of phagocytosis .
ps - liposomes uptake kinetics were identical between control subjects and patients with t1d .

results are mean +/ - sem .
comparisons between phagocytosis by control subjects dcs at 37 and 4degreesc showed significant differences [++++ p < 0.0001 , two - way analysis of variance ( anova )] ; also , significant differences were found when comparing phagocytosis in patients with t1d at 37 and 4degreesc (*** p < 0.001 , **** p < 0.0001 , two - way anova ) .

mdcs were induced by culture with cytokine cocktail .
to indirectly assess the role of ps in phagocytosis , the same analysis was performed replacing ps - liposomes with pc - liposomes ( figure 2a , lower left panel ) .
the percentages of empty pc - liposomes phagocytosis by dcs from control subjects ( n = 6 ) and patients ( n = 9 ) were significantly higher at 37degreesc when compared to 4degreesc starting at 2 h ( p < 0.0001 ) .
the kinetics of the capture did not differ between control subjects and patients .
when comparing uptake kinetics of ps - and pc - liposomes ( figure s1 in supplementary material ) , statistically significant differences were found , as expected .
the presence of ps significantly accelerated phagocytosis in the first 2 h of co - culture ( p < 0.05 ) both in control subjects and patients .
in preliminary experiments , each type of liposome was tested in several sizes ( diameter range 505 - 2,138 nm ) , and similar kinetics of capture were observed , independently of liposome size ( figure s2 in supplementary material ) , thus confirming that ps is the key factor in accelerating phagocytosis .
the viability of the different conditions of dcs ( idcs , psab - dcs , mpsab - dcs , and mdcs ) was assessed to determine liposome toxicity .
the mean viability for each condition was always > 90 % , both in dcs obtained from control subjects ( n >= 6 ) ( figure 2b , upper right panel ) , and patients with t1d ( n >= 6 ) ( figure 2b , lower right panel ) .
ps - liposomes uptake regulates the phenotypic maturation of human dcs changes in dcs phenotype were determined in control subjects ( n >= 5 ) and patients with t1d ( n >= 8 ) .
the membrane molecules assessed were : ps - receptors ( cd36 , tim4 , and alphavbeta5 integrin ) , antigen - presentation molecules ( hla - abc and hla - dr ) , adhesion molecules ( cd54 ) , costimulation molecules ( cd40 and cd86 ) , activation molecules ( cd25 ) , chemokine receptors ( ccr7 , ccr2 , and cxcr4 ) , and pattern recognition receptors ( tlr2 , cd14 , and dc - sign ) .

bars represent immature dcs ( idcs ) , idcs after the capture of psa - liposomes and psb - liposomes ( psab - dcs ) , mature psab - dcs ( mpsab - dcs ) , or mature dcs ( mdcs ) , 24 h after culture .
mdcs were induced by culture with cytokine cocktail .
data presented as mean +/ - sd of relative median of fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) , this being mfi of each culture condition referred to their respective mdcs control .
significant differences were found when comparing culture conditions in the same group of subjects (* p <= 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 , **** p < 0.0001 , wilcoxon test ) , and when comparing the same culture conditions between patients with t1d and control subjects (+ p < 0.05 , mann - whitney test ) .
ps - receptors cd36 , tim4 and alphavbeta5 integrin were expressed in idcs .
after liposome uptake , psab - dcs from patients decreased cd36 expression ( p < 0.05 ) and upregulated tim4 expression ( p < 0.05 ) in comparison to idcs , but psab - dcs presented a higher expression of cd36 and tim4 than mdcs from control subjects and patients ( p < 0.05 ) .
moreover , psab - dcs from patients had increased levels of tim4 in comparison to psab - dcs from control subjects ( p < 0.05 ) .
the expression of alphavbeta5 integrin was higher in psab - dcs than in mdcs in patients ( p < 0.05 ) .
as expected , cd36 and tim4 were downmodulated in mdcs ( p < 0.05 ) , and alphavbeta5 integrin showed the same tendency .
regarding hla molecules , hla - abc was expressed similarly in idcs and mdcs from both groups , and decreased in psab - dcs from patients after liposome capture ( p < 0.05 ) - - and control subjects displayed the same tendency .
concerning hla - dr , idcs showed a lower expression of this marker when compared to mdcs ( p < 0.001 ) .
after liposome phagocytosis ( psab - dcs ) , the low hla - dr levels were preserved .
as for the expression of adhesion molecule cd54 , it was lower in idcs from patients in comparison to mdcs ( p < 0.05 ) , and control subjects displayed the same tendency .
after liposome uptake , no changes in cd54 expression were observed in psab - dcs when compared to idcs , but mdcs displayed increased levels of cd54 in comparison to psab - dcs ( p < 0.05 ) .
the expression of cd54 was higher in mpsab - dcs exposed to a maturation stimulus despite the uptake of liposomes ( p < 0.05 ) .
expression of costimulatory molecules cd40 and cd86 was lower in idcs than in mdcs ( p < 0.01 ) .
liposome phagocytosis did not increase the expression of these molecules in psab - dcs .
moreover , psab - dcs presented lower levels of these markers when compared to mdcs ( p < 0.0001 ) , and even when exposed to pro - inflammatory stimulus ( mpsab - dcs ) in comparison to mdcs ( p < 0.05 ) .
regarding the expression of activation marker cd25 , it was lower in idcs when compared to mdcs ( p < 0.0001 ) .
upregulation of cd25 was observed after liposome uptake in psab - dcs from control subjects ( p < 0.01 ) , but remained unaltered in patients .
psab - dcs from both groups presented cd25 downmodulated when compared to mdcs ( p < 0.001 ) .
furthermore , dcs loaded with liposomes and exposed to pro - inflammatory stimulus ( mpsab - dcs ) displayed lower levels of cd25 than mdcs in patients with t1d ( p < 0.01 ) .
chemokine receptors ccr7 and ccr2 were expressed in idcs .
after liposome capture , the expression of both molecules increased in patients with t1d ( p < 0.05 ) .
ccr7 was upregulated in psab - dcs when compared to mdcs in patients ( p < 0.05 ) , and control subjects displayed the same tendency .
cxcr4 , overexpressed in mdcs in comparison to idcs ( p < 0.05 ) , was maintained low after liposome engulfment ( psab - dcs ) .
the expression of cxcr4 was higher in dcs exposed to a maturation stimulus despite the uptake of liposomes ( mpsab - dcs ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
pattern recognition receptors were assessed in dcs .
tlr2 expression was similar in all experimental conditions , despite showing a tendency to increase after liposome phagocytosis ( psab - dcs ) in patients .
cd14 was similarly expressed in idcs and mdcs , but liposome uptake and maturation stimulus induced downregulation of this marker ( p < 0.05 ) .
dc - sign , expressed in idcs , displayed a tendency to be downmodulated after liposome capture ( psab - dcs ) , especially in controls , which was more marked after a pro - inflammatory stimulus .
nonetheless , this marker showed a tendency to remain higher in psab - dcs than in mdcs in patients .
in terms of cytokine secretion by dcs from patients ( n >= 3 ) and control subjects ( n >= 3 ) ( figure 4 ) , il - 6 was released in low amounts after liposome phagocytosis and , as expected , its secretion increased after maturation stimulus .
tnf - alpha was not increased after liposome uptake and its secretion increased in pro - inflammatory conditions .
liposome engulfment maintained a high profile of tgf - beta1 secretion both in control subjects and patients , and tended to decrease in mpsab - dcs and mdcs , although non - significant .
regarding il - 10 production , psab - dcs displayed a tendency to increase the secretion , although non - statistically significant , in patients with t1d .
il - 2 , il - 17a , and ifn - gamma were not detected in any condition of the assay ( data below the detection limit ) .
il - 4 was not considered as it was used in culture media for dc differentiation .

bars represent immature dcs ( idcs ) , idcs after the capture of psa - liposomes and psb - liposomes ( psab - dcs ) , mature psab - dcs ( mpsab - dcs ) , or mature dcs ( mdcs ) .
mdcs were induced by culture with cytokine cocktail .
data presented as mean +/ - sd. significant differences were found when comparing the different conditions in the same group of subjects (* p < 0.05 , wilcoxon test ) , and differences were not found when comparing the same culture conditions between patients with t1d and control subjects ( mann - whitney test ) .
ps - liposomes uptake impairs dcs ability to stimulate autologous t cell proliferation dcs derived from patients with t1d ( n >= 12 ) and control subjects ( n = 12 ) induced similar levels of autologous t cell proliferation ( figure 5 ) .
as expected , cd4 + t cell proliferation induced by mdcs was higher than proliferation induced by idcs in both groups ( p < 0.01 ) .
cd8 + t cell proliferation induced by mdcs was higher than proliferation induced by idcs in control subjects ( p < 0.05 ) , but not in patients .
importantly , the capture of psab - liposomes by idcs did not increase autologous cd4 + and cd8 + t cell proliferation , both in patients and control subjects .
moreover , a significant decrease of cd8 + t cell proliferation induced by psab - dcs from patients was observed after liposome capture , when compared to idcs ( p < 0.01 ) .
this effect was reverted after dcs maturation .

data presented as mean +/ - sd. no differences were found when comparing the different conditions in the same group of subjects ( wilcoxon test ) , or when comparing the same culture conditions between patients with t1d and control subjects ( mann - whitney test ) .
in terms of cytokine production , pbmcs co - cultured with psab - dcs displayed a cytokine profile ( il - 6 and ifn - gamma ) similar to idcs ( figure 5 ) .
interestingly , pbmcs showed a tendency to increase ifn - gamma and il - 6 secretion when co - cultured with mpsab - dcs or mdcs , respectively , only in patients with t1d .
il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 10 , il - 17a , and tnf - alpha were not detected in any condition of the assay ( data below the detection limit ) .
transcriptional changes in dcs from patients with t1d after ps - liposomes phagocytosis point to an immunoregulatory prolife rna - seq analysis was performed in dcs from 8 patients with t1d ( table 2 ) in order to identify transcriptional changes after the capture of ps - liposomes .
phagocytosis was verified by flow cytometry using fluorescent liposomes .
after 4 h of co - culture , 73.88 +/ - 11.57 % ( mean +/ - sd ) of dcs were positive for fluorescent signal .
integrity of the isolated rna material was assessed for each sample , being optimal for rna - seq experiment : rin 9.0 +/ - 0.56 ( mean +/ - sd ) .
bioinformatics analysis of the rna - seq experiment revealed that only 233 of 22,711 genes detected were differentially expressed between idcs and psab - dcs ( p value < 0.0013 , adjusted p value < 0.1254 ). of these 233 genes , 203 ( 87.12 %) were downregulated and the remaining 30 ( 12.88 %) were upregulated , and 224 corresponded to protein - coding genes .
despite the heterogeneous basal transcriptomics of dcs from eight patients , gene expression was clearly altered toward a similar profile after ps - liposomes phagocytosis ( figure s3 in supplementary material ) .
we analyzed several categories and molecules related to dc function ( table s1 in supplementary material ) .
degs were mainly related to metabolism , gene expression , immunoregulation , signal transduction , molecule transport , post - translational protein modification , cytokine signaling , cell cycle , vesicle - mediated processes , dna replication and repair , antigen processing and presentation , apoptosis , and cytoskeleton organization ( table 5 ) .
due to the immunotherapeutic potential of ps - liposomes , degs involved in tolerance were analyzed in detail .
degs linked to the immune system were primarily downregulated and involved in antigen processing and presentation ( kbtbd6 , btk , cdc23 , ube2e3 , cd1d ) , regulation of the immune response ( dapp1 , gimap4 , slamf6 ) and cytokine signaling relevant in the interaction between t cells and dcs ( socs2 , tnfrsf11a ) .
however , although very few genes were upregulated after ps - liposomes phagocytosis , these were related to the prevention of dc maturation [ tnfsf14 , tnfaip3 , vegfa , shb , leukocyte associated immunoglobulin - like receptor 1 ( lair1 ) , nfkbia ] .
also , genes related to apoptosis were downregulated in dcs after liposome uptake ( blcap , pmp22 , lmnb1 ) .

as expected , gene expression analysis in dcs from 9 control subjects showed the same pattern .
regarding mdcs - - from 4 patients with t1d and 3 control subjects - - we observed a seemingly different gene expression pattern when compared to psab - dcs - - and with idcs .
genes upregulated by ps - liposomes , such as cyth4 and tnfsf14 , tended to be downregulated in mdcs ; other genes tended to be differentially expressed in mdcs ( nfkbia , plaur , tnfaip3 , gimap4 , vegfa , and hpgd ) in comparison to the other conditions .

discussion apoptosis is a key factor in the maintenance of immunological tolerance .
the uptake of apoptotic cells , through a process called efferocytosis , results in tolerogenic presentation of autoantigens inducing specific tolerance rather than autoimmunity ( 14 ) .
therefore , the inherent immunomodulatory properties of apoptotic cells can be useful to design innovative immunotherapies .
based on this tolerogenic potential of efferocytosis , we generated liposomes that mimic apoptotic beta - cells .
at present , liposomes are clinically used mainly as vehicles for drugs ( 29 - 31 ) , but they can be designed to modulate immune responses .
this liposome - based immunotherapy resembles apoptotic cells and acts through the immunosuppressive signal of ps ( 32 ) and tolerogenic autoantigen presentation .
these large ps - liposomes , after phagocytosis , are effective in restoring self - tolerance in experimental autoimmune diseases ( 16 , 17 ) by their interaction with dcs and the arrest of the autoimmune reaction .
to explore the clinical potential of this strategy , we have determined the effect of ps - liposomes loaded with human insulin peptides in dcs from patients with t1d .
this effect has been assessed in several aspects : phagocytosis , phenotypic changes , effect on t cell proliferation and cytokine profile .
regarding phagocytosis , lipid membrane composition is crucial for rapid engulfment by dcs , as demonstrated using ps - and pc - liposomes .
as expected , the presence of ps accelerated phagocytosis of liposomes both in control subjects and patients with a dynamic typical of apoptotic cell clearance .
ps - liposomes were more efficiently engulfed by dcs than the equivalent ones without ps in the first 2 h of co - culture , reaching plateau after 6 h. when encountering ps - liposomes , dcs are deceived into sensing that they are actual apoptotic cells that need to be rapidly efferocyted in order to avoid secondary necrosis that could contribute to autoimmunity ( 33 , 34 ) .
moreover , the preservation of dcs viability proved that ps - liposomes are not toxic , as reported for other types of liposomes ( 29 - 32 ) .
the second aspect was the assessment of dcs phenotype .
after liposome engulfment , psab - dcs maintained high levels of ps - receptors that mediate this uptake , when compared to mdcs , pointing to the preservation of phagocytosis ability in tolerogenic dcs ( toldcs ) .
interestingly , the upregulation of tim4 expression observed in psab - dcs from patients might contribute to a positive feedback of phagocytosis .
upon maturation , ps - receptors were downmodulated correlating with the phagocytic capacity of mdcs , as described ( 35 ) .
the expression pattern of molecules involved in antigen presentation ( hla , costimulatory and adhesion molecules ) in psab - dcs concurs with a tolerogenic function , both in patients and control subjects .
the expression of cd25 activation marker , linked to dcs activation and autoimmunity ( 36 , 37 ) , confirmed the intermediate activation status of psab - dcs after phagocytosis .
also , the chemokine receptors expression pattern supports dcs ability to drive their migration to secondary lymphoid tissues ( 38 , 39 ) , and moreover , the high ccr7 expression is associated with induction of tolerance after efferocytosis ( 40 ) .
additionally , the expression of pattern recognition receptors was not altered by liposomes , as described for human dcs ( 32 ) .
this phenotype is similar to the previously observed in mice ( 16 , 17 ). of note , rna - seq analysis reinforces these results .
furthermore , upon liposome capture , the immunomodulatory cytokine tgfbeta - 1 was secreted , a reported effect driven by ps ( 34 ) that could suppress dc maturation and define the t cell response afterward .
as expected , liposome capture did not induce il - 6 nor tnf - alpha secretion by dcs , but maturation did .
overall , the results point to the tolerogenic effect of these vesicles , which act on re - establishing self - tolerance .
we observed minor phenotypic differences between dcs from patients and control subjects , which could be due to epigenetic changes caused by autoimmunity and metabolic dysregulation ( 41 - 43 ) .
the third aspect was the analysis of autologous t cell proliferation induced by psab - dcs .
in agreement with dcs phenotype , t cell proliferation induced by psab - dcs was similar or even lower than the induced by idcs , both in patients and control subjects .
interestingly , in patients with t1d , there was a significant reduction in cd8 + t cell subset proliferation induced by toldcs when compared to idcs .
this effect could be related to a reduction of the t cell cytotoxic activity , the most important effector response in human t1d ( 44 , 45 ) .
in fact , after efferocytosis , dcs present apoptotic cell autoantigens to cognate t cells in the absence of costimulation , favoring tolerance to self ( 12 , 13 ) .
it is reasonable to think that liposomes mimicking apoptotic cells will cause a similar effect , additional studies using tetramers would be relevant to determine the antigen - specificity of the t cells involved in tolerance induction , even in pro - inflammatory conditions , in which t cells seem to proliferate more vigorously .
cytokines produced during the autologous t cell proliferation assay induced by psab - dcs discard a th1 and th17 profile , which could be detrimental in the induction of tolerance .
in fact , ifn - gamma , which is involved in a th1 response , and il - 6 secretion , which partially contributes to induce th17 response in t1d ( 46 ) , remain poorly secreted in co - cultures of pbmcs with psab - dcs .
interestingly , higher amounts of il - 6 and ifn - gamma tend to be produced by mdcs from patients with t1d when compared to controls .
this feature could reflect the ongoing autoimmune reaction , present in peripheral blood from patients ( 47 ) .
one of the obstacles of tolerogenic therapies in human disease is the heterogeneity of the ex vivo - generated toldcs , which vary depending on the source , the manufacturing protocols , and the timespan of the experiment .
work is in progress to define and standardize a set of phenotypical and functional characteristics of toldcs ( 48 ) .
to date , toldcs are accepted as maturation - reluctant cells with low expression of antigen - presenting and costimulatory molecules and a tolerogenic - skewed cytokine profile ( 49 ) .
in this sense , one of the advantages of direct administration of the liposomes reported herein would be the generation of toldcs in vivo , avoiding ex vivo cell manipulation .
our previous results in mice demonstrate this hypothesis ( 16 , 17 ) .
however , a global picture of changes induced by ps - liposomes phagocytosis would grant a better understanding of tolerogenicity .
to fully characterize the immunomodulatory effects of liposomes , transcriptomic analysis was performed in dcs .
eight patients with a short t1d duration were selected in order to minimize the influence of long - term hyperglycemia on immune response , as reported ( 41 - 43 ) .
rna - seq revealed a set of degs that avoid dcs maturation and contribute to tolerogenic antigen presentation .
one of the most hyperexpressed genes was the vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) a ( vegfa ) , involved in cytokine signaling after efferocytosis ( 50 ) , idcs recruitment and maturation inhibition ( 51 ) .
vegf increases the expression of the tnfsf14 gene ( 52 ) , also upregulated by ps - liposomes ( 53 ) .
in turn , tnfsf14 upregulates the production of tgf - beta by phagocytes ( 54 ) , and upon interacting with its ligand in t cells , tnfsf14 regulates t cell proliferation ( 55 ) , inducing local immunosuppression ( 56 ) .
supporting this fact , apoptotic cell clearance has been described to inhibit inflammation via tgf - beta and vegf production ( 34 ) .
additionally , vegfa enhances the expression of indoleamine 2,3 - dioxygenase ( ido ) ( 57 ) , which in turn codifies for an immunomodulatory enzyme expressed in toldcs ( 58 ) .
moreover , the hematopoietically expressed homeobox ( hhex ) gene , a repressor of vegf signaling ( 59 ) , is downregulated after ps - liposomes phagocytosis , whereas an inductor of vegf expression , activating transcription factor 4 ( atf4 ) ( 60 ) , is upregulated .
furthermore , the hyperexpressed sh2 domain containing adaptor protein b ( shb ) gene codifies for a protein that regulates vegf - dependent cellular migration ( 61 ) , th2 polarization and t regulatory cell induction ( 62 ) .
other upregulated tolerogenic genes , such as the tnf alpha induced protein 3 ( tnfaip3 ) and the lair1 , can inhibit dc maturation and their deficiency causes autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases ( 63 - 66 ) .
in the same way , the hyperexpression of the nfkbia gene would contribute to inhibit dc maturation and t cell activation ( 67 , 68 ) .
regarding cytokine signature , our results agree with those found in phenotypic and functional experiments .
a relevant cytokine for tolerance induction is tgf - beta1 , secreted after efferocytosis ( 69 ) .
after ps - liposomes capture , dcs showed a biological increase of tgf - beta1 transcription , although non - significant , probably due to the short timespan of the experiment ( 70 ) .
in fact , tgf - beta1 was found in culture supernatants 24 h after ps - liposomes phagocytosis .
also , the immunoregulatory interferon lambda receptor 1 ( ifnlr1 ) gene is one of the few overexpressed in dcs after ps - liposomes uptake .
this receptor induces toldcs that promote regulatory t cell expansion ( 71 ) .
unexpectedly , the tnf - encoding gene was upregulated in dcs after liposome phagocytosis , and the same tendency was observed in protein secretion .
nevertheless , this behavior was very different to that observed in mdcs , which secreted higher amounts of tnf .
the increase of tnf gene expression in our rna - seq agrees with the upregulation of tnfsf14 and tnfaip3 genes .
furthermore , a critical role for tnf has been reported in human toldcs in the induction of antigen - specific regulatory t cells ( 72 ) .
also , our previous results showed that murine toldcs upregulated tnf - gene expression after efferocytosis ( 14 ) .
overall , these results are consistent with the pleiotropic effects of tnf .
furthermore , in our previous research , pge2 was found to be crucial in tolerance induced by ps - liposomes in mice ( 16 ) .
strikingly , this pathway does not seem to be upregulated in human dcs , probably due to divergences between mice and men .
nevertheless , our data indirectly point to the involvement of the pge2 pathway in human dcs : first , the downregulation of the hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15 - ( nad ) ( hpgd ) gene , involved in pge2 degradation , and second , a biological upregulation ( although non - significant ) of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ( pparg ) , a gene induced by prostaglandins which is a negative regulator of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( 73 ) .
furthermore , pge2 has been described to stimulate the synthesis of vegf ( 74 ) .
in summary , comparative transcriptome studies identify the whole molecular features of toldcs rather than describe a simple state of maturation or lack thereof in terms of phenotype and function ( 75 ) .
further studies are required to find a common signature of tolerogenicity , a fact hindered by individual differences of human dcs and the heterogeneous results obtained with different agents used to promote toldcs .
our findings describe the specific gene signature of ps - liposomes - induced toldcs .
their genomic program , which drives a different functionality than those of idcs and mdcs , contributes to dissect the complexity of tolerance regulation .
perhaps not so peculiarly , most of the alterations found in dcs after ps - liposomes capture are also physiopathological strategies used by tumor cells to escape immune surveillance .
small vesicles rich in ps are released by tumor cells and act as immunosuppressive agents to inhibit tumor antigen - specific t cells ( 76 ) .
tumor cells can induce immunological tolerance using mechanisms characteristic of apoptotic cell clearance , and ps - liposomes seem to make use of the same pathways to achieve similar effects .
the use of ps - liposomes filled with autoantigens is an innovative strategy to arrest autoimmunity by restoring tolerance to self .
as a whole , our results support the tolerogenic behavior of dcs , induced by the phagocytosis of ps - liposomes , and suggest that , in the context of autoimmunity , they could act silencing potential autoreactive t cells .
this process could possibly be an active silencer , and not only a lack of maturation of dcs .
in summary , here we unveil a picture of efferocytosis mimicry that leads to phenotypic and functional changes in human dcs , accountable for tolerance induction .
the herein reported results reinforce the potential of this biocompatible immunotherapy to re - establish immunological tolerance , opening the door to new therapeutic approaches in the field of antigen - specific autoimmune disorders .

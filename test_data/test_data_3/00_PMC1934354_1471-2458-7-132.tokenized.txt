background socioeconomic status is a predictor not only of mortality , but also of cardiovascular risk and morbidity .
an ongoing debate in the field of social inequalities and health focuses on two questions : 1 ) is individual health status associated with individual income as well as with income inequality at the aggregate ( e. g. regional ) level ?
2 ) if there is such an association , does it operate via a psychosocial pathway ( e.g. stress ) or via a " neo - materialistic " pathway ( e.g. systematic under - investment in societal infrastructures ) ?
for the first time in germany , we here investigate the association between cardiovascular health status and income inequality at the area level , controlling for individual socio - economic status .
methods individual - level explanatory variables ( age , socio - economic status ) and outcome data ( body mass index , blood pressure , cholesterol level ) as well as the regional - level variable ( proportion of relative poverty ) were taken from the baseline survey of the german cardiovascular prevention study , a cross - sectional , community - based , multi - center intervention study , comprising six socio - economically diverse intervention regions , each with about 1800 participants aged 25 - 69 years .
multilevel modeling was used to examine the effects of individual and regional level variables .
results regional effects are small compared to individual effects for all risk factors analyzed .
most of the total variance is explained at the individual level .
only for diastolic blood pressure in men and for cholesterol in both men and women is a statistically significant effect visible at the regional level .
conclusion our analysis does not support the assumption that in germany cardiovascular risk factors were to a large extent associated with income inequality at regional level .
background it is well established that employment grade , educational level , and household income are important predictors of mortality [ 1 ] , cardiovascular risk factor levels and morbidity [ 2,3 ] .
the international research supports an inverse association between socioeconomic status and cardiovascular disease [ 4 - 6 ] .
more recently , the impact of socioeconomic factors throughout life course has been examined [ 7,8 ]. an ongoing debate in the field of inequality and health focuses on two as yet unproven extensions of this association , which can be phrased as research questions : 1. is individual health status associated with individual income and ( particularly ) with income inequality at aggregate ( e. g. regional ) level ?
[ 9 ] 2 .
if there is indeed an association between income inequality and health status , does it operate via a psychosocial pathway ( stress due to perceptions of relative disadvantage and the psychological consequences of inequality ) [ 9,10 ] ; or via a " neo - materialistic " pathway ( systematic under - investment across a wide range of societal infrastructures such as libraries , schools , hospitals ) ?
[ 11 ] evidence for an association between income inequality and mortality at regional level has mostly come from the us [ 12,13 ] .
no such association has been found in canada and in denmark [ 13,14 ] , and mackenbach ( 2002 ) considered the evidence to be " disappearing " and the us as " the exception " [ 15 ] .
the debate is not over yet .
the danish study [ 14 ] was restricted to the capital , copenhagen , a city that probably has better societal infrastructure than other parts of the country .
hence , the geographical unit used may have been too small [ 16 ] to conclude that there is no association between area income inequality and mortality in denmark .
moreover , in the scottish heart health study , a significant variance in mean levels of cardiovascular risk factors persisted at the district level [ 17 ] ; this again shows that factors related to area / place do influence health status .
a us study on cardiovascular disease risk factors found a contextual effect of income inequality for three of the four analyzed risk factors , notably among persons with low income [ 18 ] .
furthermore , in white americans an inverse association of socioeconomic status with cardiovascular mortality was reported [ 19 ] .
it has to be stated that , from a theoretical as well as from an empirical view , it is not clear which regional level is the most appropriate to analyze the question , but ".. .
ignoring the role of group - or - macro - level variables may lead to an incomplete understanding of the determinants of disease in individuals as well as in populations " [ 20 ] .
ecologic and multilevel studies as well as comparisons of well defined areas have been conducted to investigate area effects .
multilevel models negotiate the restrictions of ecological studies ( aggregate level ) .
area and individual level factors are analyzed simultaneously with the person as unit of analysis [ 21 ] .
most often , cross - sectional data are analyzed , providing a one - point measure of the association of interest .
this does not take into account area effects in early life as origin of disease .
for this purpose , a longitudinal study design ( birth cohorts , record linkage ) would be essential , focusing on the development of e.g. cardiovascular disease in later life .
the debate on income inequality and health should be pursued because of its obvious implications for public health policy .
findings could inform decisions as to the level at which interventions should be prioritized - at the individual level or at societal level .
more studies are needed from outside the us. studies should be designed so they allow adjusting for income ( or a proxy thereof , e. g. educational attainment ) at individual level .
alternatively , a regional deprivation score , e.g. the townsend score , can be used as a measure [ 22 ] .
health status could be measured in terms of cardiovascular risk factor levels instead of mortality ( requiring larger sample sizes / longer observation ) or self - reported health ( less reliable ) .
as the issue is to test hypotheses about different explanatory models , rather than to report on the present situation in a particular country , the data used for such analysis do not necessarily have to be recent .
we here investigate the association of cardiovascular health status with income inequality at area levels controlling for individual socio - economic status for germany .
admittedly , our data base does not allow for an investigation of the development of health inequalities during the past 25 years , such as has been influenced by reunification , migration of labor from east to west , ( temporary ) unemployment , flexible work arrangement , and fixed - term contracts , among others .
however , this is not the primary objective of this study .
methods appropriate individual - level exposure and outcome data are available from the baseline data set of the german cardiovascular prevention study ( dhp ; 1984 - 1986 ) , a cross - sectional , community - based , multi - center intervention study [ 23 ] .
it comprises data from six geographically defined , socio - economically diverse intervention regions , covering a total population of about 356,000 persons ( see figure 1 ) .
in each region , samples were drawn from registration offices , and about 1800 individuals aged 25 to 69 years possessing german citizenship were enrolled using a cluster sampling approach .
participation rates lay between 69.6 % and 82.5 % .
for data analysis , one of the regions was split into two , because it comprises two separate cities , bruchsal and mosbach , with possibly different levels of inequality and risk factors .
therefore , the following regions were available for modeling analyses : berlin - spandau , bremen north and west , bruchsal , karlsruhe , mosbach , stuttgart west and vaihingen and the district of traunstein .
regions differ considerably regarding gross value added per inhabitant , poverty rate and , to a lower degree , regarding unemployment ( table 1 ) .

during examination , two blood pressure readings were taken .
results from the second reading and fifth phase ( diastolic blood pressure ) were taken for modeling .
also , a blood sample was taken and total serum cholesterol in mmol / l was determined in one of two central laboratories with high standard of quality control .
the cholesterol measurement was converted in mg / dl using the factor 38.667 .
cholesterol was taken as an approximation to ldl blood levels due to the fact that laboratory tests on hdl / ldl were not available in 1218 of the participants , due to unsuccessful precipitations .
body height and weight were measured by medical staff .
the resulting body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated by the study group and is part of the data set .
level 1 variables ( individual level ) age ( in completed years , mean age : 45.6 years in men , 46.5 years in women ) and bmi ( as continuous variable , mean bmi : 26.3 kg / m2 in men , 25.5 kg / m2 in women ) were centered about the grand mean ( all values were converted so that the mean is 0 ) .
we applied the so called ' winkler - index ' to assess socioeconomic status ( ses ) .
this index is a three dimensional , additive , non - weighted social class index using education , occupation and household - income as indicators .
this index is based on a short version of the ' scheuch - index ' , one of the few indices of its kind that has been validated .
each indicator ranges in points from 1 to 7 , with 1 representing the lowest and 7 the highest status .
the winkler index can thus take values between 3 and 21 points [ 24 ] .
based on this score , 3 social classes with equally - sized ranges were defined .
lower ses ranges from 3 to 8 points , middle ses from 9 to 14 and upper ses from 15 to 21 points .
the simple three - class model has the advantage that semantics matches everyday life perception of social classification.the variable ' education ' was defined by highest academic / professional qualification .
monthly net household income with 11 categories served as basis for the ' income * variable and ' occupation ' comprised 20 categories , which were subsumed in 5 groups ( blue collar workers , self - employed persons including family workers , white collar workers , civil servants including professional soldiers and others [ 24 ] .
problems occur in assigning social class to the non - employed part of the german population ; hence , the occupation of the person with the main household salary was used to define socioeconomic status of each person in the household .
married women most often provide a smaller portion of the household salary [ 25 ] and their status then is defined by the occupational status of the husband .
for this reason , for women additional analyses were performed using the educational status - cut into 3 categories : lower , middle , upper ses - instead of the winkler index to examine the degree of disagreement between the household based ( husband based ) ses definition of the index and the individual based educational status .
the occupational status of pensioners was defined by the last occupational activity .
the variable ses was coded as dummy variable with lower ses as reference .
to measure status inconsistency , for all of the three ses - variables three categories were defined : category " low " comprising 1 and 2 points , category " medium " with 3 , 4 and 5 points and category " high " comprising 6 and 7 points .
if the ses of a person was classified by any combination of the categories " low " and " high " from ses indicators , this was considered as status inconsistency .
analyses were performed for both sexes separately .
level 2 variable ( regional level ) equivalence income was calculated on the basis of household income and number of persons in the respective household using the non - modified oecd - scale .
the first adult was weighted with a factor of 1.0 , additional adults with 0.7 .
children up to 18 years were weighted with 0.5 .
the equivalence income thus calculated for all regions was 1427 dm ( 729.6 euro ). a per - capita income of less than 713 dm ( 364.6 euro ) was considered as relative poverty , affecting between 5.6 % ( region 2 ) and 21.0 % ( region 3 ) of participants of both sexes .
this variable ( see table 2 ) was centered about the grand mean and assesses a change of 1 % in the proportion of relative poverty in the corresponding models .

in the baseline model , only the variable age was included .
in the full model , all additional variables according to the respective modeling were included ( see additional file 1 ) .
variables with alpha > 0,175 were removed stepwise as in a backward elimination ( this means that the respective variable with the highest p - value is removed from the model ) with the exception of the dummy variable ses , which was removed only when middle and upper ses did not fulfill the criterion ( lower ses is reference ) .
thus the p - value for eliminating variables is within the range of 0.15 to 0.20 , as recommended in hosmer & lemeshow for stepwise regression [ 26 ] , p108.baseline and final models are presented in tables 4 to 7 ( see additional files 2345 ) .
analysis of residuals was performed only when there was a significant regional level variance in the final model .
sensitivity analyses in a first step the base model ( age only ) was extended by including the aggregate level - variable ' relative poverty ' .
then the three components of the social class index ( educational level , income , profession ) were added and considered separately and in all combinations .
in a second step , the level 2 variable , ' relative poverty ' , defined by equivalence income was replaced with ' per - capita income ' and then with an aggregated ' household income ' - variable and ' unemployment - rate ' calculated by means of self - reported data of participants .
additionally , the ' gross value added per inhabitant ' from 1988 was taken as level 2 variable .
this value ranges from 26,500 dm in karlsruhe to 66,000 dm in stuttgart ( taken from an internal paper of the dhp - study group ) .
the german cardiovascular prevention study was approved by the responsible ethics commission .
results the total sample comprised n = 11,548 persons ( 5464 males , 6084 females ) .
528 cases ( 4.6 %) were deleted due to missing values .
the analysis of missing data showed an arbitrary missing pattern .
the maximum number of missing values was 361 for cholesterol ( both genders ) .
there is heterogeneity of mean cardiovascular risk factor levels at baseline [ 27 ] and also in terms of income inequality .
the prevalence of lower ses varies in men from 10.8 % in region 1 to 24.1 % in region 3 , and in women between 20.2 % in region 6 and 38.7 % in region 7 ( table 1 ) .
data was analyzed for status inconsistencies that might be masked using the winkler - index .
inconsistencies were found in 4,5 % of participants ( n = 494 ) .
they more often occur in females ( 5.2 % ; n = 299 ) than in males ( 3,7 % ; n = 195 ) .
as the results are only marginally affected , the respective data has not been removed .
table 3 ( see additional file 1 ) shows all variables that have been used for modeling and sensitivity analyses .
body mass index men in the final model , different fixed individual effects were analyzed .
the mean region - level score for men is 26.3 kg / m2 on condition that the remaining predictors in the models are 0 ( centered about grand mean ) and with lower ses as reference .
the model demonstrates that bmi increases with age ( an increase of one year in age is accompanied by an increase of 0.07 kg / m2 in bmi ) .
the association with higher socioeconomic status is inconsistent , as bmi increases in middle ses but decreases in upper ses .
the association of individual ses ( upper class ) with bmi level is statistically significant .
the level 2 variable ' relative poverty ' ( household income < 713 dm ) , describing the fixed regional effect , has been removed because of the pre - defined exclusion criterion ( p > 0.175 ) .
social inequality at aggregate level thus cannot explain differences of bmi in men .
results show a statistically significant association of individual ses ( upper class ) on bmi level .
examining random effects allows a comparison of individual and regional effects on total variance not explained by fixed effects : most of total variance occurred at the individual level ( estimates : 11.0 for individual vs. 0.17 for regional level ) .
regional level variance is small and not statistically significant .
the proportion of total variance explained at regional level is 1.5 % .
women for the final model , all variables fulfill the inclusion criterion ( p <= 0.175 ) .
the mean region - level score is 26.6 kg / m2 .
in women , bmi increases with age and decreases with higher socioeconomic status .
a weak association of poverty with bmi is found .
most of the proportion of total variance is explained by individual level variance .
regional level variance is small and not significant and explains only 0.7 % of total variance for the final model ( see additional file 2 ) .
systolic blood pressure in men , blood pressure increases with age and increasing bmi and decreases with higher socioeconomic status .
a statistically significant effect of individual ses on systolic blood pressure can be shown .
in women , high blood pressure increases with age and bmi level .
associations with ses groups are inconsistent ( see additional file 3 ) .
diastolic blood pressure for men , a small but statistically significant effect of inequality on the aggregate level ( variable " poverty ") was found ( see additional file 4 ) .
for women , results show an inverse association of diastolic blood pressure with ses .
residuals : comparing the regions residuals are the differences between observed values and values predicted by the model , calculated as ' observed - predicted ' .
residuals describe the variance not explained by the corresponding model .
analysis of residuals was performed only when there was a significant regional level variance in the final model .
this only applied to the final model on systolic blood pressure for women .
blood pressure values varies from + 4.5 mmhg in mosbach to - 5.7 mmhg in traunstein , when the mean systolic blood pressure of all regions was set to 0 ( see figure 2 ) .
in addition , differences can be observed for bremen (+ 3.4 mmhg ) and stuttgart ( - 1.6 mmhg ) .
all other regions lie close to the average .
figure 2 residuals from multivariate models , systolic blood pressure , women .
serum cholesterol men the variable poverty shows a statistically significant association with cholesterol level ( see additional file 5 ) .
an increase of 1 % in the proportion of poverty results in a decrease of cholesterol by - 0.58 mg / dl. women a significant association of poverty with cholesterol level was found .
effects of ses are moving in opposite directions .
the effect of bmi is small but significant .
to avoid possible over - adjustment , additional analyses were performed without the bmi variable .
results do not differ in a noteworthy manner .
educational status ( women ) bmi while estimates for middle ses ( est. - 1.49 ; p < 0.001 ) and upper ses ( est .
- 3.01 ; p < 0.001 ) differ from the model using the winkler index , the area level variable is not affected by the use of the educational status .
systolic blood pressure again estimates for ses differ : middle ses ( est. : 1.06 ; p < 0.001 ) and upper ses ( est. - 1.56 ; p < 0.001 ) .
the level 2 variable has been removed as in the original model .
sensitivity analyses to test the sensitivity of the results towards modeling assumptions , different models for the variables bmi and diastolic blood pressure were performed .
the results of the level 2 variable ' relative poverty ' do not change in any model ( see additional file 6 ) .
thus , a possible composite effect seems to be very small in both models .
removing the level 2 variable from corresponding models does not affect the level 1 variables in any appreciable way .
in a second step , the level 2 variable ' relative poverty ' defined by equivalence income was replaced with other variables .
comparing the level 2 variables , results are rather similar , with the exception of the unemployment - rate and the gross value added per inhabitant ( see additional file 7 ) .
discussion health inequalities have been studied in germany for some time , and the results are very clear : morbidity and mortality increase strongly with decreasing socio - economic status [ 28 ] .
these observations are very similar to those in other western european countries [ 29 ] .
little information is available concerning the regional aspects of health inequalities , i.e. the differences in morbidity and mortality between regions characterized by indicators of socio - economic status .
also , to date no regional deprivation score has been developed .
there is a long tradition of using these scores , mainly in the uk. well known are , for example , the townsend score , the carstairs index , the jarman score , the breadline score , and the index of multiple deprivation [ 30 - 33 ] .
in the uk , the health care system is largely organized on the regional level ; this is why these deprivation scores carry very practical importance .
lynch and colleagues [ 34 ] reviewed 98 aggregate and multilevel studies examining associations of income inequality with health .
for the us , a robust association was found between income inequalities and health outcomes in aggregated data at the state level .
in multilevel studies , results are most consistent at the state level , while results at other levels are inconsistent .
for other countries , both aggregated and multilevel studies suggest a small or no effect , except in the united kingdom .
additionally , time trends in income inequality and mortality show little congruence at the national level in the us [ 35 ] .
multilevel analyses are rarely conducted in germany .
to date , there seems to be just one published study ; and it is difficult to access for the international audience , as it is published in german [ 36 ] .
the analyses are based on interviews with about 400 adults from 38 city districts in cologne .
the results show that morbidity is lower in the upper status districts , and that much of this difference is explained by individual social status .
just about 5 % of the variance is explained by regional effects ; this effect is statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) , but still rather small .
in our study , potential effects of inequality at regional level on the cardiovascular risk factors - bmi , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , as well as serum cholesterol - were analyzed using mixed models .
the level 1 variables , age , ses , body mass index , and high serum cholesterol , respectively , and the level 2 variable , poverty , were included as explanatory variables .
the effects of area on each risk factor were examined separately .
all analyses were performed separately for males and females .
the analysis addresses directly the question as to whether there is evidence for an association between income inequality and risk factor level at area level .
fixed effects show an increase of the respective risk factor level with age for all models .
also , the body mass index is significantly associated with risk factor levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum cholesterol .
an association of socioeconomic status with risk factors has been found in most models .
ses has no significant effect on cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure in men .
the level 2 variable , poverty , has been removed from 2 of the 8 models .
a statistically significant association has been found with diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol in men , and with cholesterol in women , indicating that regional inequality ( poverty ) as explanatory variable plays a role regarding risk factor levels .
a weak association has been found for systolic blood pressure in men and bmi and diastolic blood pressure in women .
gini coefficients ( sas code by philip n. cohen [ 37 ]) calculated on the basis of the income variable with 7 categories showed differences between regions too small to test the hypothesis .
consequently , regional differences in risk factor levels cannot be explained by income distribution as measured with this coefficient .
instead , the variable ' relative poverty ' has been defined to describe inequality at regional level.analysis of residuals ( systolic blood pressure in women ) shows that " healthy " and " unhealthy " regions can be identified .
the region of traunstein can be defined as a " healthy " region and moosbach as the " un - healthiest " region in this study , if the effects in the corresponding model ( figure 2 ) are considered .
it has to be pointed out , however , that these differences between regions are based on other effects than relative poverty .
the finding that individual socio - economic status is more relevant to health inequalities than regional differences of per - capita income points to the fact that these two levels of stress have different impacts on health : individual - level stressors influence the health status of the individuals exposed to these stressors very directly .
ecological - level stressors could add an extra burden on health , but the effect of this extra burden is much more indirect .
future studies should aim at analyzing the interactions between these different stressors in more detail .
weaknesses of this study : the results are based on the baseline data of 6 intervention regions of a nation - wide cross - sectional health survey conducted during the mid - 1980s .
besides methodological restrictions due to the study design ( cross - sectional ) , the age of the data does not allow to draw conclusions with regard to the current situation in germany .
this situation has changed considerably due to the reunification and the migration of labor from east to west and as a consequence of aging populations in many regions of the east .
the steep rise in unemployment , flexible work arrangements , and fixed - term contracts during the past few years are other important changes potentially affecting the health status of the population .
the present study used predefined intervention regions for analysis .
hence , a definition of smaller or larger regional units was not feasible .
using the winkler index to define ses might bias the information on social status .
reasons are status inconsistencies and the inclusion of unemployed persons - reasons that are especially relevant to women .
in the latter case , the position of the husband in the occupational system has been used to define one of the three indicators of the index .
hence , additional analyses were performed omitting inconsistent data and with educational status as alternative indicator of ses .
comparisons show that the winkler index bias results only marginally when inconsistent data are not removed .
another point in coding the index might be an object of discussion : the use of the occupational status of the person earning the main household salary .
thus the status of unemployed married women , but also of married women in part - time or comparably low paid full time employment , is partially defined by the status of their husbands .
this approach can bias results .
the corresponding analysis in women showed stronger differences , using educational status instead of the index , but again results changed only to a small degree.strengths of this study : data for the mid - 1980s is available only from few statistical departments of the german federal states .
therefore the german cardiovascular prevention study is an important data base to describe population health in the 1980s .
the results of this paper can serve as a basis to analyze the temporal changes in germany over the past 25 years .
data of the german cardiovascular prevention study allow for an analysis of individual and geographical variations in cardiovascular risk factors as predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .
the intervention regions examined are characterized by differences in the size of cities , in the proportion of blue collar workers , in average income , etc .
as a whole , however , the pooled intervention regions are similar in characteristics to former west germany .
using data from the time before re - unification means that we do not have to deal with major changes in economic situation , and possibly cardiovascular risk profiles , within a very short time period .
excluding non - german residents avoids bias , as migrants often " bring along " lower cardiovascular risk factor levels from their countries of origin [ 38 ] .
conclusion during the mid - 1980s , regional effects of social inequality on cardiovascular health played a minor role in germany compared to individual effects .
the fact that individual measures of cardiovascular risk factors are largely explained by individual measures of social status stress the importance of interventions focusing on persons with low socio - economic status .
it is important to point out , though , that regions characterized by high income inequalities show an increased risk of high blood pressure and high levels of total serum cholesterol .
these regional effects are hard to detect , and they are rather small , but they still give some support to the hypothesis that income inequality is a risk factor in its own right .

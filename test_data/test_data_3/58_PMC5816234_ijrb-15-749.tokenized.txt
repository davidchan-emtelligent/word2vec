background : infertility is described as not receiving pregnancy despite unprotected and regular sexual intercourse in a 1 yr period .
it is detected by 15 % of the couples .
male and female factor in the etiology may be detected in similar rates .
objective : the present study aims to investigate ion channel gene expression in semen samples of infertile male compared with fertile men .
materials and methods : a total of 150 men who applied to the urology clinic due to infertility were divided into five equal groups : asthenozoospermia , oligozoospermia , oligoasthenoteratozoospermia , teratozoospermia , and normozoospermia ( control ) .
all paticipants were evaluated with cation channel spermia ( catsper ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , proton voltage gated ion channel1 ( hv1 ) , potassium channel subfamily u1 ( kcnu1 ) , and transmembrane protein ( tmem16a ) gene expression in semen samples .
results : " catsper1 , 4 , hv1 , kcnu1 , and tmem16a gene expression were detected higher in the oligozoospermia group compared to the controls .
catsper1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , kcnu1 , and tmem16a gene expression in the asthenozoospermia group and catsper1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , kcnu1 , and tmem16a gene expression in the teratozoospermia group were detected lower compared to the controls .
catsper1 , 4 , hv1 , and tmem16a gen expression were higher in the oligoasthenoteratozoospermia men than the controls while catsper3 gen expression was detected as lower. " conclusion : it was detected that these ion channels have an effect on sperm progressive motility and morphology .
it may be considered that mutations in these ion channels may result in infertility .
key words infertility male genes ion channels sperm introduction the etiology of infertility remains still unclear by more than 50 % of the couples wishing to achieve pregnancy ( 1 ) .
elements , such as zinc , magnesium , copper , chlorine , potassium and calcium , are important for the maintenance of normal spermatogenesis , sperm maturation , dna metabolism and repair and gene expression in germ cells ( 2 ) .
spermatozoa mainly perform the transport of na + , k + , cl - and ca + 2 ions through voltage gated and ligand gated ion channels .
recent investigations in knockout mouse models have identified many ion channel genes involved in spermatogenesis , and their mechanisms of action are currently being clarified .
however , some of these findings have been directly applicable to humans because phenotype in mice does not always have direct counterparts in humans ( 1 , 3 ) .
after ejaculation of the sperm cells into the female reproductive tract , the sperm cells enter a different micromilieu where ion concentrations , ph and osmotic pressures are changed ( 4 ). by the adaptation period , the sperm cells get involved in processes like capacitation , acrosome reaction and fertilization , where normal function of ca + 2 , k + , cl - , gamma - amino butyric acid and ion channels is required ( 5 ) .
the major ion channels which may be found in the sperm cell are cation channel spermia ( catsper ) , potassium channel subfamily u1 ( kcnu1 ) , proton voltage - gated ion channel1 ( hv1 ) , transmembrane protein ( tmem16 ) .
catsper 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 are weakly voltage dependent and ph sensitive ion channels .
they are permeable for ca2 + ions and demonstrate sperm specific features .
it was demonstrated that the localization of the catsper ion channels are at the main part of the sperm flagellum .
these ion channels are necessary for progressive sperm motility , sperm decomposition in the female reproductive tract , oocyte penetration and fertilization ( 3 ) .
human spermatozoa are immotile in the male reproductive system and get activated by entering the female reproductive tract .
alcalization of the sperm cytoplasm is necessary for this activation process .
the hv1 which is also located at the main part of the sperm 's flagellum like catsper plays a role by the induction of the intracellular alcalization and the activation of the spermatozoa .
the hv1 also helps activation of catsperion channels .
slo3 / kcnu1 is potassium voltage - gated ion channel and is also located in the main part of the sperm 's flagellum .
it was reported that slo3 is sensitive to both ph and the voltage level , plays a role by sperm capacitation and / or acrosome reaction and a mutation in the gene coding this ion channel may result in defective sperm activation and fertility .
slo3 is shown to facilitate the potassium ions to move out of the sperm cell and to decrease the membrane voltage into more negative values .
slo3 has a vital function in the acquisition of normal morphology and sperm motility ( 1 ) .
tmem16 is a calcium activated chloride channel and is located in the head part of the spermatozoa , it is thought to have a role by induced acrosome reaction ( 6 ) .
in this study catsper1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , kcnu1 , hv1 , and tmem16 ion channel expressions were studied in infertile men with oligoasthenospermia , isolated asthenozoospermia , teratozoospermia , and oligozoospermia in comparison with fertile individuals with normal sperm parameters .

discussion we have detected statistically significant differences in the ion channel gene expressions by impaired progressive motility and morphology patients compared to the control.the incidence of male factor is reported as 30 % by the etiology of infertility ( 9 ) .
even by normal sperm parameters the etiology of infertility remains still unclear by more than 50 % of the couples wishing to achieve pregnancy and this phenomenon is called idiopathic infertility ( 1 ) .
ion channels are one of the new research topics and are considered to have an important role in the etiology of idiopathic infertility ( 10 ) .
it has been shown that loss of function in the ion channels may impair sperm physiology by causing abnormal capacitation , loss of hyperactivation and impaired acrosome reaction ( 1 ) .
even by the presence of complete normal sperm parameters , fertilization may fail .
for this reason , it is of big importance to understand the ion channel functions on the sperm cell because it may lead to develop new treatment strategies for idiopathic infertility .
catsper is a sperm - specific , weak voltage - dependent calcium selective channel and is ph sensitive .
it acts by the control of the positive loaded calcium ions into the sperm cell and is necessary for sperm hyperactivation and fertilization .
it was shown that catsper ion channels are located on the main part of flagellum by rat and human .
catsper is a heterotetrameric calcium channel and is consisted of 4 different pore forming alfa subunits ; catsper 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 3 auxiliary subunits called catsper beta ( beta ) , catsper gamma ( gamma ) and catsper delta ( delta ) ( 3 ) .
ren and his colleagues have shown the necessity of catsper presence for normal sperm motility and oocyte penetration .
in studies consisting of catsper - / - transgenic and normal rats it was detected that catsper - / - sperm revealed weak vitality , decreased motility and curling in the tail part .
studies performing computer - assisted sperm analysis have shown impairment in the forward progressive motility and decrease in swimming speed by catsper - / - sperm ( 11 ) .
in another study , fertilisation capacity of catsper - / - was evaluated in - vitro and it was shown that catsper - / - sperm were not able to fertilize the oocyte while normal sperm cells revealed a fertilisation rate of 81 % .
it is reported that some catsper - / - sperm were able to adhere but not penetrate to the oocyte and the study has also shown that fertilisation occurs in oocytes with enzymatically removed zona pellucida by both catsper +/+ and catsper - / - rat sperm which may confirm strongly that catsper is necessary for penetration ( 1 ) .
in a study of tamburrino et al , it was reported that catsper1 gene expression was decreased in spermatozoa from asthenospermic patients .
the study also showed a decrease in progressive motility and acrosome reaction ( 12 ) .
another study revealed that catsper1 - / - and catsper2 - / - spermia are not able for hyperactivation during capacitation process ( 3 ) .
avenarius and colleagues have found a correlation between catsper1 and catsper2 mutation and asthenoteratospermia ( 14 ) .
in a study of bhilawadikar and colleagues , it was shown that catsper2 expression was decreased by asthenozoospermic patients ( 15 ) .
hildebrand and colleagues have detected that by the absence of catsper2 expression sperm malformation was present by 88 % while short sperm head and curling flagellum was present by 30 % which they were correlated with the decrease in sperm motility ( 16 ) .
jin and colleagues have stated that catsper3 - / - and catsper4 - / - male rats were infertile even they were showing normal mating attitude .
in their study , they have shown that catsper3 - / - and catsper4 - / - rats were infertile despite their normal sperm count and motility .
the same study has reported that hyperactivation during capacitation was observed 30 min after incubation at room temperature by normal spermatozoa but first motility was detected at 2 hr after incubation by catsper3 - / - ve catsper4 - / - sperm cell .
this result supported that functional catsper3 and catsper4 may be necessary for hyperactivation of sperm during capacitation ( 17 ). by scanning of current literature only one study about catsper ion channels in human was found .
this study reported a correlation between catsper1 mutation and idiopathic asthenospermia ( 10 ) .
in our study we have reported a decrease in catsper1 and catsper2 gene expression by asthenozoospermia and teratozoospermia groups .
the gene expression of catsper1 revealed an increase by oligozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia groups where as catsper2 gene expression revealed no significant change by oligozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia groups .
the study also revealed that presence of catsper1 and catsper2 gene expression may be positively correlated with hyperactive motility and morphology .
catsper3 gene expression has shown a decrease in the asthenozoospermia , teratozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia groups compared to the control but no significant change in the oligozoospermia group .
catsper3 ion channel was also positively associated with hyperactive motility and morphology .
in our study we detected a decrease of catsper4 gene expression in asthenozoospermia and teratozoospermia group and an increase in the oligozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia groups .
our study also revealed a relation between catsper4 and hyperactive motility and morphology in a positive way .
in the light of all these data revealed in our study we consider that catsper ion channels may play an important role in the sperm physiology .
in this study , we have detected a significant increase of hv1 gene expression in the oligozoospermia and oligoasthenozoospermia groups , an insignificant decrease in the asthenozoospermia group and no significant change in the teratozoospermia group compared to the control .
as we have mentioned in the introduction part , human spermatozoa are activated by alcalization of the sperm cytoplasm and the hv1 gene is responsible for the induction of the intracellular alcalization by extracellular proton transfer and the activation of the spermatozoa .
hv1 also activates the catsper ion channels and plays a role by sperm hyperactivity .
since hv1 gene may not be found by rats , there is no sufficient data about detailed function of this gene but according to the known mechanisms regarding the function , we can predict that a potential hv1 ion channel mutation may result in infertility in human ( 18 ) .
slo3 / kcnu1 is a potassium voltage - gated ion channel and is specific to the testicular tissue regarding some studies made by rats .
slo3 / kcnu1 is localized on the main part of the sperm 's flagellum ( 1 ) .
ksper / slo3 is considered as responsible for the potassium transfer and ph depended potassium conductivity in rat sperm cell .
a physiologic ionic gradients of sperm with normal type ksp is slo3 is hyperpolarized , while slo3 / kcnu1 - / - sperm is depolarized ( 19 ) .
santi and colleagues have stated that slo3 can only be found by mammals and is specific for testis .
in this study , they used slo3 / kcnu1 knock - out rats and showed a deficit in ph sensitive potassium flow by testicular sperm cell where no fertilization was observed after mating of these mutant homozygote male rats with healthy female rats .
studies revealed that slo3 / kcnq1 ion channels are the main responsible ion channels for hyperpolarization during capacitation and no other ion channel may substitute them .
it has also shown that mutant sperm cells are depolarized after capacitation .
slo3 / kcnu1 mutant sperm cells may reach an acrosome reaction after termination of hyperpolarization but could not achieve the zona pellucida penetration .
the osmotic milieu is also an important issue for the sperm flow towards the oocyte .
potassium and slo3 / kcnu1 ion channels play a role in this osmotic volume regulation. by osmotic volume dysregulation , the sperm cell swells and morphological changes occur .
these changes may prevent the sperm cell to adhere to the oocyte and result in infertility ( 20 ) .
in our study , we detected an increase of slo3 / kcnu1 gene expression in the oligozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia groups and a decrease in the asthenozoospermia group compared with the control .
no significant change was observed in the teratozoospermia group regarding the slo3 / kcnu1 gene expression .
slo3 / kcnu1 gene expression decreased in the oligozoospermia , asthenozoospermia and teratozoospermia groups compared to the control but no significant change was observed in the oligoasthenoteratozoospermia group .
regarding these data , we can say that slo3 / kcnq1 gene expression may be specifically effective by progressive motility of the sperm cell .
tmem16a is a calcium - activated chloride channel located in the head part of the human sperm cell .
the role of tmem16a in the sperm capacitation and zona pellucida induced acrosome reaction was shown in former studies ( 21 ) .
zanetti and mayorga stated that tmem16a is responsible for regulation of cell volume and plays an important role by reducing the distance between the outer acrosomal membrane and plasma membrane and facilitating the acrosome exocytosis ( 22 ) .
in our study , we have observed an increase of tmem16a gene expression in oligozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia groups and a decrease in the asthenozoospermia and teratozoospermia groups compared to the control .
conclusion according to the results we have achieved in this study , we assume that a decrease in the function of the ion channels may be related to male infertility especially by asthenozoospermic and teratozoospermic patients .
there is a need for detailed evaluation in future studies with larger numbers to investigate this mentioned relation by oligozoospermia and oligoasthenoteratozoospermia patients .
we believe that complete clarification of the ion channel functions and developing activator / inhibitor molecules targeting these channels could bring therapeutic options for patients with idiopathic infertility into existence .
also , these activator / inhibitor molecules could affect solely on sperm cells and may be the precursors of drugs providing male contraception .

background inflammatory processes play important roles in both neuropathic and inflammatory pain states , but the effects of inflammation per se within the sensory ganglia are not well understood .
the cytokine growth - related oncogene ( gro / kc ; cxcl1 ) shows strong , rapid upregulation in dorsal root ganglion ( drg ) in both nerve injury and inflammatory pain models .
we examined the direct effects of gro / kc on small diameter drg neurons , which are predominantly nociceptive .
whole cell voltage clamp technique was used to measure voltage - activated potassium ( k ) currents in acutely cultured adult rat small diameter sensory neurons .
fluorescently labeled isolectin b4 ( ib4 ) was used to classify cells as ib4 - positive or ib4 - negative .
results in ib4 - negative neurons , voltage - activated k current densities of both transient and sustained components were increased after overnight incubation with gro / kc ( 1.5 nm ) , without marked changes in voltage dependence or kinetics .
the average values for the slow and fast decay time constants at 20 mv were unchanged by gro / kc. the amplitude of the fast inactivating component increased significantly with no large shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation .
the increase in k currents was completely blocked by co - incubation with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( chx ) or nf - kappab inhibitors pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( pdtc ) or quinazoline ( 6 - amino - 4 - ( 4 - phenoxypheny lethylamino ; qnz ) .
in contrast , the voltage - activated k current of ib4 - positive neurons was unchanged by gro / kc. gro / kc incubation caused no significant changes in the expression level of eight selected voltage - gated k channel genes in quantitative pcr analysis .
conclusion the results suggest that gro / kc has important effects in inflammatory processes via its direct actions on sensory neurons , and that activation of nf - kappab is involved in the gro / kc - induced enhancement of k currents .
background inflammatory processes are recognized to play key roles in chronic pain .
the traditional distinction between inflammatory and nerve injury models of chronic pain has been recently augmented by the recognition that even nerve injury models have inflammatory components .
many cytokines and chemokines with previously established roles in the immune system have also been found to have direct effects on peripheral and central neurons , and to play key roles in pathologic pain [ 1 - 3 ] .
one such chemokine is growth - related oncogene ( gro / kc ; systemic name cxcl1 ) .
we first became interested in this molecule because it was very strongly and rapidly upregulated in drg in several different pain models , including the spinal nerve ligation model [ 4 ] and a model in which pain behaviors are evoked by localized inflammation of the drg [ 5 ] .
gro / kc is well known for its role in neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation early during inflammation .
in this regard its effects are similar to those of other cxc family cytokines such as interleukin - 8 ( il - 8 ; cxcl8 ) in humans [ 6 ] .
gro / kc may also have direct roles in the nervous system , including roles in pathological pain .
both gro / kc and its primary receptor , cxcr2 ( il - 8rb ) are expressed in neurons and other cells in the central nervous system , under both normal and pathological conditions [ 7 - 13 ] .
in the peripheral nervous system , gro / kc stimulates calcium influx [ 14 ] , and release of the pain - related peptide calcitonin gene - related peptide ( cgrp ) [ 15 ] from cultured neonatal drg neurons .
levels of gro / kc in inflamed muscle tissue correlate well with nociceptive behavior [ 16 ] .
in general , these studies in peripheral nervous system suggest a pro - nociceptive role for gro / kc ( however , see [ 17 ]) .
previously we have described a rat pain model in which localized inflammation of the drg ( lid ) is induced by depositing a small drop of the immune stimulator zymosan over the l5 drg .
this leads to prolonged mechanical pain behaviors , and a rapid increase in levels of gro / kc and other pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 5 ] in the drg .
we have also demonstrated that lid causes marked increases in excitability , large increases in na currents and , to a lesser degree , k currents [ 18 ] in small diameter drg neurons as observed with patch clamp methods after acute culture .
in that study , ttx - sensitive na currents increased 2 to 3 fold in both ib4 - positive and ib4 - negative cells , while ttx - resistant na currents increased over 2 - fold but only in ib4 - positive cells .
transient k currents increased over 2 - fold , while sustained k currents showed a very modest though significant increase .
the observed increases in na and k current densities were due to increased amplitude , not to large shifts in voltage dependence of activation or inactivation ; the increase in transient k current was due to increased amplitude of the faster - inactivating current of two kinetically distinct components .
in a second study [ 19 ] , we found that some of these effects on na currents could be mimicked by overnight incubation with gro / kc ( 1.5 nm ) .
overnight gro / kc treatment in acutely cultured neurons led to increased excitability , and to 2 - to 4 fold increases in ttx - resistant and ttx - sensitive na currents ( in both ib4 - positive and ib4 - negative cells ) without altered voltage dependence or kinetic changes .
changes in na current were blocked by a protein synthesis inhibitor , and we observed increases in mrna abundance of particular na channel isoforms that are already present in control cells .
the results suggested that gro / kc may have important pro - nociceptive effects through direct effects on neurons , and were consistent with the idea that some though not all of the changes observed after lid in vivo might be mediated by this chemokine .
in the present study we have extended this line of research to study the in vitro effects of gro / kc on voltage - activated k currents , as these were also increased by local drg inflammation .
we have also begun to examine possible signaling pathways by which gro / kc might effect these changes in neuronal properties .
methods animals young female sprague - dawley rats ( body mass 100 - 150 g ) were housed one or two - per cage under a controlled diurnal cycle of 12 h light and 12 h dark with free access to water and food .
the ambient environment was maintained at constant temperature ( 22 +/ - 0.5degreesc ) and relative humidity ( 60 - 70 %) .
all the surgical procedures and the experimental protocol were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the university of cincinnati ( cincinnati , ohio , usa ) .
acute culture of sensory neurons rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium ( 50 mg / kg ) .
the bilateral l4 and l5 drgs were isolated and the sheath was carefully removed in ice - cold normal ringer solution .
the connective tissue was digested by exposure to ca2 + - free solution containing 1.0 % collagenase ii ( fisher scientific , pittsburgh , pennsylvania , usa ) for 30 min at 37degreesc followed by washout in normal ringer solution for another 10 min .
drgs were then dissociated by trituration with fire - polished pasteur pipettes .
drg cells were plated onto poly - d - lysine coated glass coverslips in medium199 ( sigma , st. louis , missouri , usa ) containing 10 % heat - inactivated fbs and 1000 u / ml each of penicillin and streptomycin .
gro / kc ( rat recombinant , from cell sciences , canton , massachuesetts , usa and peprotech , rocky hill , new jersey , usa ) and / or other drugs were added to the medium immediately after plating or as indicated , and the drg cells were incubated at 37degreesc ( 5 % co2 balance air ) .
recordings were made after overnight culture and drug incubation ( 16 - 24 hours ) , and cells were selected for recording based on diameter (< 25 mum ) and the absence of processes .
isolectin b4 ( ib4 ) 1 mug / mul ( conjugated to fitc ; sigma ) was added to the culture medium for 30 - 60 min prior to the start of recording sessions to identify ib4 - postive ( primarily non - peptidergic ) and ib4 - negative ( primarily peptidergic ) neurons [ 20,21 ] .
this procedure has been previously shown not to affect the currents measured [ 22 ] .
neurons showing a robust fluorescence signal were classified as ib4 - positive and those displaying no signal at all , ib4 - negative .
we have previously shown that gro / kc incubation does not alter the fraction of cells that is ib4 - positive [ 19 ] ; hence in some cases ib4 - status was determined before recording from a cell in order to obtained matched sets of data .
throughout each individual experiment , we alternated between recording from control and experimental cells during the recording period so as to compare control and experimental cells taken from the same cultures .
for experiments in which there were four experimental groups ( e.g. gro / kc , gro / kc plus drug , control , control plus drug ) , only two groups were examined per culture .
some sets of cultures were used to determine the effects of drug on gro / kc treated cells , and different sets were used to determine the effects of the drug on control cells in the absence of gro / kc. drugs were applied at the following concentrations : gro / kc 1.5 nm , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( pdtc , sigma ) 50 mum , quinazoline ( qnz , calbiochem ) 100 nm ( stocks made with ethanol and control cells treated with vehicle ) , cycloheximide ( sigma ) , 3.55 mum .
electrophysiological recording after over - night culture ( 16 - 24 hours ) , coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber .
whole cell voltage - clamp recordings of small drg neurons ( diameter 15 - 25 mum ) were conducted at room temperature with an axopatch - 200b amplifier ( molecular devices corp , union city , california , usa ) .
patch pipettes ( 2.5 - 4.0 momega ) were fabricated from borosilicate glass .
data were acquired on a pentium iv computer with the clampex 8 program ( molecular devices corp ) .
the cell capacitance artifact was canceled by the nulling circuit of the recording amplifier .
voltage errors were minimized by using >= 80 % series resistance compensation .
the current was filtered at 5 khz and sampled at 50 khz .
the recording chamber was continuously perfused at room temperature with oxygenated bath solution at a flow rate of 1 - 2 ml / min .
resting membrane potential was measured 1 min after a stable recording was obtained .
current pulses from - 0.2 to 0.4 na ( 80 - ms pulse duration ) were delivered in increments of 0.03 na until one or more aps were evoked .
neurons were selected for further study if they had a resting membrane potential that was more negative than - 45 mv and if they exhibited overshooting action potentials .
the bath solution was then switched to that used for measuring k current ( see below ) .
total k current was measured by depolarizing voltage steps after a 1 - s prepulse to - 120 mv. the difference between the peak current and the current at the end of the pulse was used as a measure of the transient k current , and the current at the end of the pulse was used as a measure of the sustained current .
voltage dependence of inactivation was measured by test pulses to 20 mv after 1 - s prepulses to voltages between - 100 and 0 mv. solutions for recording potassium currents the normal bath solution contained 130 mm nacl , 5 mm kcl , 2 mm cacl2 , 1 mm mgcl2 , 10 mm hepes , and 10 mm glucose .
the ph was adjusted to 7.4 with naoh , and the osmolarity was adjusted to approximately 300 - 310 mosm with sucrose .
after the whole cell configuration was established and current clamp measurements of excitability and resting potential were completed , the bath solution was changed to one used for recording k currents , which contained 130 mm choline cl , 5 mm kcl , 1 mm mgcl2 , 2 mm cocl2 , 10 mm hepes , and 10 mm glucose .
the ph was adjusted to 7.4 with tris base , and the osmolarity was adjusted to approximately 300 - 310 mosm with sucrose .
the pipette solution contained 140 mm kcl , 1 mm cacl2 , 2 mm mgcl2 , 11 mm egta , 10 mm hepes , 2 mm mg adenosine triphosphate , and 1 mm li guanosine triphosphate .
the ph was adjusted to 7.2 with tris base , and osmolarity was adjusted to approximately 290 - 300 mosm with sucrose .
voltages were not corrected for liquid junction potentials , which were estimated to be less than 10 mv in all cases .
data analysis and statistics data were analyzed using clampfit 9 ( molecular devices corp ) , graphpad prism ( graphpad software , inc. , san diego , california , usa ) , origin 7 ( origin lab corp. , northampton , massachusetts , usa ) , and sigmastat ( systat software , inc. , san jose , california , usa ) .
currents were normalized by cell capacitance .
data are expressed as mean +/ - standard error of the mean ( sem ) .
statistical significance of differences between average values in experimental and control neurons was analyzed by student 's t - test or , for data that were not normally distributed , the mann - whitney rank sum test .
in the case of multiple comparisons over a voltage range for activation or inactivation data , the data were analyzed by two - way repeated measures anova ( rm anova ) , with pairwise multiple comparison ( holm - sidak method ) to determine at which voltages the differences between experimental and control cells were significant if an overall effect of gro / kc or drug treatment was observed .
significance was ascribed for p < 0.05 .
quantitative pcr total rna was isolated from drg cultures under conditions similar to those used in electrophysiological recordings , using a stratagene absolutely rna microprep kit ( stratagene , la jolle , california. usa ) .
immediately after isolation , rna was reverse transcribed into cdna using an iscript cdna kit ( bio - rad , hercules , california usa ) .
cells treated overnight with 1.5 nm gro / kc were compared with control cells from the same animal .
relative channel expression was determined by quantitative pcr using a stratagene mx - pro 3005p .
cdna samples were amplified in triplicate ( 10 min at 95degreesc , followed by 40 cycles of 30 s 95degreesc , 60 s 60degreesc , then 60 s 72degreesc , followed by a 60 s step to 76degreesc for sybr green fluorescence measurement ) in a 25 mul reaction volume ( 400 nm each forward and reverse primers , sybr green reaction mix ( roche applied science , indianapolis , indiana , usa )) .
fluorescence was normalized with the reference dye rox , and gene expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine ribosyltransferase ( hprt ; [ 23 ]) , run on the same plate .
primers were selected using the primer3 program [ 24 ] and were designed to include exon - intron boundaries to minimize contamination by genomic dna , except for the intronless kv1.3 .
primers were examined with an in silico virtual pcr program to ensure that no other products were predicted from rat cdna or genomic dna , and / or by blasting the predicted pcr products against the rat reference mrna sequence database .
pcr products were verified by melting point analysis at the end of each experiment , and , during protocol development , by gel electrophoresis .
template from control cells was run side - by - side with template from gro / kc - treated cells from the same culture .
the baseline calculation , threshold , threshold cycle , and efficiencies of the amplification reactions were estimated directly from the reference - dye normalized amplification plots using the linreg program and a correction for efficiencies was included in the relative expression calculations [ 25 ] .
efficiencies were generally similar for control and gro / kc treated samples , and across experiments ; a single efficiency value was used for control and gro / kc samples for each gene .
forward and reverse primer sequences used for the genes listed in table 1 [ 26 ] are available in additional file 1 .

all expression values were normalized to that of the housekeeping gene hprt from the same sample ; fold changes ( gro / kc / control ) were calculated for each individual pair of matched samples .
for comparison of relative abundance of channel types in control cells , expression data were normalized to the most abundant channel observed , kv1.1 .
none of the fold - change values after overnight gro / kc incubation was significantly different from 1 .
* , channel type as given by reference [ 26 ] , " dr " = delayed rectifier ; however , k channel properties may also depend on accessory proteins and heteromer composition .
results incubation with gro / kc enhances voltage - gated k currents in ib4 - negative cells voltage - activated k currents were recorded as shown in figure 1 .
the membrane was held at - 60 mv , and voltage steps were applied in 10 mv increments up to a value of + 60 mv after a 1s prepulse to - 120 mv. the total k current was comprised of sustained components , as measured at the end of the 500 - ms pulse , and transient components which largely decayed during the pulse .
in view of the complexity and variability of k currents in drg neurons [ 27 - 29 ] , and for comparison with our previous studies [ 18,19 ] , we analyzed the effects of gro / kc incubation on these two components , the transient ( ia ) and the sustained ( ik ) .
the transient component did not always completely decay during the 500 ms pulse ; however , we determined that estimating the steady state ( sustained ) current from the extrapolated constant value of two - exponential fits to the falling phase of the current resulted in only a minor correction in most cells , and did not change the overall results reported here ( data not shown ; see [ 18 ]) .
figure 1 voltage activated k currents of drg neurons in ib4 - negative cells .
currents shown were evoked by depolarizing pulses from - 60 to + 60 mv. examples are shown from a control cell ( a ) and from a gro / kc incubated cell ( b ) .
the difference between the peak current ( 1 ) and the current at the end of the pulse ( 2 ) was used as a measure of the transient k current .
the current densities of both transient ( p < 0.001 ) and sustained components ( p < 0.001 ) were increased after overnight incubation with gro / kc ( 1.5 nm ) in ib4 - negative neurons ( figure 2 ) .
two - way repeated - measures analysis of variance indicated that the effect of gro / kc was significant at all points above 10 mv in ib4 - negative cells .
these effects were primarily due to increased amplitude of the current , without any large changes in the voltage dependence of activation ( figure 3 ) ; however , the activation curve for the transient component showed a small ( 5.5 mv ) but significant leftward shift after gro / kc incubation .
figure 2 voltage activated k current in ib4 - negative dorsal root ganglion neurons increased after gro / kc incubation .
the current densities of both the transient component and sustained components were increased after overnight incubation with gro / kc ( 1.5 nm ) in ib4 - negative neurons .
* , the effect of gro / kc was significant at all points above 10 mv ( left ) .
there was no significant effect in ib4 - positive neurons ( right ) .
data are from 5 cultures ; in ib4 - negative neurons , n = 15 gro / kc and 16 control cells ; in ib4 - positive neurons , n = 16 gro / kc and 15 control cells .
figure 3 effect of gro / kc treatment on voltage - dependence of k current activation in ib4 - negative cells .
data from figure 2 were converted to conductance values using the calculated value of the k nernst potential .
data were fitted with the boltzmann equation .
top : the transient component showed a small but significant leftward shift of v1 / 2 , from 14.3 mv in control cells to 8.8 mv in gro / kc treated cells ( p < 0.0005 ) .
the hill slope values were 10.3 and 11.7 mv , respectively ( for e - fold change ; difference not significant ) .
bottom : there was no significant change in the voltage dependence of activation of the sustained component .
best - fit shared parameters were - 9.3 mv for v1 / 2 and 15.1 mv for hill slope .
there was no significant change in k current density in ib4 - positive neurons after gro / kc incubation ( figure 2 ) .
in subsequent figures we show results only from ib4 - negative neurons .
however , all experiments shown were also conducted in ib4 - positive neurons .
these experiments simply confirmed the original findings ; we did not observe significant differences due to gro / kc or any drug treatment between any of the experimental groups in ib4 - positive cells .
the apparently greater density of the transient and sustained currents in control ib4 - positive cells compared to control ib4 - negative cells ( figure 2 ) was not statistically significant .
in the course of these experiments we also replicated our previously published results [ 19 ] showing that gro / kc incubation led to decreased rheobase and lowered action potential threshold in ib4 - negative cells , and that the cells acquired the ability to fire repetitively throughout the course of a prolonged current injection .
the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation was also determined for the voltage - activated k currents .
the protocol consisted of a 1 - s conditioning prepulse to potentials ranging between - 100 and 0 mv followed by a voltage step to a + 20 mv test pulse for 1 s. as in our previous study [ 18 ] , the decay of the outward current at + 20 mv could be well described in most cells as the sum of a sustained component and two exponentially decaying transient components whose time constants differed by an order of magnitude .
the average values for the slow and fast time constants in ib4 - negative cells were unchanged by gro / kc ( 1100.1 +/ - 254 ms.1 vs. 861.3 +/ - 154.2 ms , and 62.4 +/ - 7.8 ms vs. 57.6 +/ - 4.8 ms , respectively ; figure 4 ) .
fast and slow time constants in ib4 - positive cells were also not significantly changed by gro / kc incubation , and did not differ significantly from those observed in ib4 - negative cells .
figure 4 inactivation time constants at + 20 mv are not affected by gro / kc incubation .
the falling phase of the currents at a test pulse of + 20 mv following prepulses between - 100 and 0 mv was fitted with the sum of two exponentials .
the time constants for the slow and fast components were not significantly changed by gro / kc incubation .
the steady state inactivation of each of these three components was studied individually by fitting the data at the + 20 mv test pulse with the sum of two exponentials plus a constant ( steady state ) value , as in our previous study [ 18 ] .
as shown in figure 5 , in ib4 - negative cells the fast inactivating ( middle panel ) component showed a simple increase in amplitude after gro / kc ( p = 0.04 ) , with no significant shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation .
for the slow inactivating component and steady state component ( figure 3 ) , the amplitudes were numerically increased , but this difference was not significant ( p = 0.71 and 0.44 , respectively ) , and the voltage dependence was not affected .
figure 5 effects of gro / kc on the fitted two exponential fits to steady state inactivation data .
the falling phase of currents during a pulse to + 20 mv after a prepulse to the indicated voltage was fit with the sum of two exponentials plus a steady state value .
at this test voltage , most cells show two kinetically distinct components of the transient k current .
the values of the amplitudes of each component are normalized to the value at - 100 mv ( top ) : left , slow inactivating ; middle , fast inactivating ; right , steady state component .
the bottom panels show the corresponding absolute values of the fitted amplitudes .
* individual voltages at which the differences between gro / kc and control values were significant .
data in this and previous figures are from 5 cultures ; n = 12 gro / kc cells and 11 control cells .
enhancement of k currents by gro / kc is blocked by a protein synthesis inhibitor the finding that gro / kc enhanced the magnitude of k currents in ib4 - negative cells , without marked shifts in voltage dependence of activation or kinetics suggested that the primary effect might be an increased number of k channels , and hence that protein synthesis might be required .
to test this idea , we conducted experiments using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide .
the results are shown in figure 6 .
in general , cycloheximide prevented the gro / kc - induced increases in k current density , without significantly affecting baseline current densities ( p = 0.755 ) .
in ib4 - negative cells , the only significant differences observed were between the gro / kc treated groups and all other groups .
figure 6 treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( chx , 3.5 mum ) blocked the effects of gro / kc on k currents in ib4 - negative cells .
chx had no effect on k currents in control cells ( p = 0.755 ) .
chx was added at the same time as gro / kc and was present throughout the incubation period .
gro ( n = 19 ) and gro + chx ( n = 18 ) cells were from 9 cultures ; 12 control cells and 8 chx cells were from 2 cultures .
effects of gro / kc are blocked by nf - kappab inhibitors two nf - kappab inhibitors , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( pdtc ) and quinazoline ( 6 - amino - 4 - ( 4 - phenoxypheny lethylamino ) , qnz ) were used to explore the possible signaling pathway of gro / kc effects on k currents .
pdtc or qnz was added 1 h before gro / kc and was present throughout the incubation period .
both pdtc and qnz blocked the effects of gro / kc on k currents .
neither had effect on k currents in control cells ( p = 0.867 and 0.999 , respectively ) ( figure 7 ) .
figure 7 the nf - kappab inhibitors pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( pdtc ) and quinazoline ( 6 - amino - 4 - ( 4 - phenoxypheny lethylamino ) , qnz ) blocked the effects of gro / kc on k currents .
qnz was dissolved in ethanol .
pdtc or qnz was added 1 h before gro / kc and was present throughout the incubation period .
neither pdtc nor qnz had an effect on k currents in control cells ( p = 0.867 and 0.999 , respectively ) .
* , significantly different from all other groups at this voltage .
in pdtc experiments , gro / kc ( n = 18 cells ) , gro / kc + pdtc ( n = 18 ) were from 4 cultures , control ( n = 13 ) and pdtc ( n = 11 ) were from 4 cultures ; in qnz experiments , gro / kc ( n = 26 ) , gro / kc + qnz ( n = 26 ) were from 7 cultures , control ( n = 6 ) and qnz ( n = 9 ) were from 2 cultures .
quantitative pcr analysis of selected k channels the electrophysiological experiments suggested that the increase in k current in ib4 - negative cells after gro / kc incubation was not due to the appearance of new channels with novel properties not seen in control cells .
qualitatively consistent with this idea , quantitative pcr experiments on selected voltage activated k channels did not reveal any types that were present only after gro / kc analysis ( table 1 ) .
however , we did not examine all the possible genes coding for k currents that might mediate the delayed rectifier or a - type currents observed .
discussion in this study we found that overnight incubation with gro / kc ( cxcl1 ) , a chemokine that is rapidly upregulated in the drg in several different models of chronic pain , caused upregulation of k current amplitudes in acutely isolated small diameter ib4 - negative drg neurons in short - term culture .
this upregulation required protein synthesis and activation of nf - kappab .
many studies on the role of chemokines in pain conditions , including gro / kc ( e.g. , [ 30 ]) , have focused on their indirect effects on neurons , via stimulation of release of inflammatory mediators from immune and glial cells that then act on sympathetic and sensory neurons .
since our cultures are relatively sparse , and we record primarily from isolated neurons with few or no glial cells attached , it seems most likely that the effects of gro / kc incubation on k currents were due to direct effects on the neurons .
our previous study indicated that gro / kc receptors are found on both ib4 - positive and ib4 - negative neurons in acute culture ( and in vivo ) , and that gro / kc can have important pro - nociceptive effects via its direct actions on sensory neurons [ 19 ] .
we observed effects on k currents at a relatively low gro / kc concentration of 1.5 nm , which is well within the physiological range for most peptide receptor actions and within the range of concentrations reported to be effective at the cxcr2 receptor [ 15 ] .
this concentration was chosen based on our previous study , in which we demonstrated that incubation with 1.5 nm gro / kc but not lower concentrations ( 0.06 or 0.28 nm ) caused significant upregulation of na currents .
potassium currents have important roles in modulating neuronal excitability .
previous studies described three major components of voltage - gated potassium current in small sensory neurons , including non - inactivating current and fast and slow transient currents as we have analyzed here [ 27,29,31 - 33 ] .
however , this is undoubtedly an oversimplification ; for example , one study delineated six components of k current , five of which were in small diameter neurons such as studied here [ 28 ] .
k channel genetic diversity suggests a possibly larger number , especially given the existence of functionally distinct heteromers and splice variants in the several gene families that mediate voltage - activated k currents [ 34 ] .
our preliminary quantitative pcr study indicated that all seven of the delayed rectifier and a - type ( inactivating ) channels as well as the regulatory accessory protein mink - p2 that we selected for study were readily observed in our acute drg cultures .
the method was not sensitive enough to detect upregulation of particular channels that might account for our electrophysiological results , though this is perhaps not surprising given the relatively small increase that would be expected ( 2 - fold or less increases in current density occurring in less than half of the cells present in the cultures ) .
the expression results confirmed that , qualitatively consistent with the electrophysiological findings , gro / kc incubation did not induce marked upregulation of a k channel gene with distinct properties that was absent in control cells .
however , it should be noted that we looked at only 8 genes , not every gene known to possibly mediate the types of k currents measured .
the most robust effect of gro / kc in this study was the relatively large increase ( aprox .
2 fold ) in amplitude of the faster - inactivating component of the transient k current .
( this may correspond to iaf and / or iht in the paper by gold et al. , given that our measurements were at + 20 mv where these components have similar decay time constants. ) the complex forms of the averaged steady state inactivation curves we observed even when dividing the k current into fast - inactivating , slow - inactivating , and constant components ( fig 5 ) suggest that multiple channel types are present .
within the context of the simplified analysis used here , the effect on the transient k current is qualitatively quite similar to that observed in our previous study of the effects on localized drg inflammation on k currents ([ 18 ] ; see introduction ) .
however , that study did not divide cells into ib4 - positive and ib4 - negative cells , yet still showed over 2 fold increases in magnitude of the faster inactivating component , whereas in the present study a similar increase was observed in ib4 - negative cells with no increase in ib4 - positive cells .
since ib4 - negative cells comprise about half of the population of small cells under our culture conditions , it seems that the observed effects of gro / kc are consistent with the effects of localized inflammation on transient k currents , but are not sufficient to account for all those effects quantitatively .
in contrast , the effects of gro / kc incubation on sustained k currents were much more modest , and unlikely to play a role at physiological voltages .
this increase was significant in ib4 - negative cells when currents were examined from a - 120 mv prepulse ( fig 2 ) , but not from more positive prepulses going into the physiological range ( fig 5 ) .
these effects on sustained k current are very similar to those observed after lid [ 18 ] .
calcium - activated k currents were not examined in the current study because of the presence of egta in the recording pipette and co2 + replacing ca2 + in the extracellular solution .
potassium channel reduction is thought to contribute to the increased excitability and generation / patterning of spontaneous activity in sensory neurons following peripheral nerve injury [ 35 - 37 ] .
potassium currents are not always reduced under pathological conditions ; they may be upregulated as recently described by our group in a pain model induced by localized inflammation of the drg [ 18 ] .
in that model , both potassium currents and sodium currents are increased in small drg neurons after a localized inflammation , and the increase in na current density is quite large ( 2 - fold or more ) .
it seems likely that it is the balance of effects on na and k ( and other currents ) which determines the net effect on excitability .
our previous study of effects of gro / kc incubation on excitability parameters [ 19 ] showed that many measures of excitability were increased by gro / kc in both ib4 - negative and ib4 - positive cells .
however , two differences between the two subtypes were that ib4 - negative cells showed a more marked increase in the ability to fire repetitively , as well as an increase in the after - hyperpolarization .
hence it is interesting that only these ib4 - negative cells showed an increase in transient k currents , which can play a role in making repetitive firing possible [ 38,39 ] .
however , it should be noted that other currents not examined in this study may also play a role in determining the afterhyperpolarization and repetitive firing , such as the hyperpolarization - activated current ih [ 40 ] , calcium - activated k - currents [ 41 ] , and the kinetic properties of the various na channel subtypes [ 42 ] .
the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( chx ) completely blocked the effects of gro / kc on k currents , which indicated that protein synthesis is required for the effect on k currents .
the simplest explanation would be that additional k channels are synthesized after gro / kc incubation , as this would be consistent with the observation that primarily it is the magnitudes of some components of the k currents are altered , not their activation ranges or decay time constants .
however , there may be other possibilities such as synthesis of proteins that modulate channels already present .
gro / kc actions are thought to be mediated by the cxcr2 receptor , a g - protein - coupled receptor , which has been shown to activate a number of different signaling pathways in neurons , including intracellular ca2 + , inositol tris - phosphate , map kinases , and creb [ 43 ] .
all of these pathways can lead to enhanced transcription and protein synthesis through a number of signal transduction pathways .
nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kappab ) is a transcription factor which serves as a transducer between extracellular signals and gene expression .
we chose this pathway for initial study because of its key role in inflammation , and showed that pretreatment with either of two nf - kappab inhibitors , pdtc and qnz , prevented the enhancement of k currents induced by gro / kc. a number of proinflammatory cytokines , including tnf - alpha [ 44 ] , il - 1alpha [ 45 ] , il - 6 and ciliary neurotrophic factor [ 46 ] , can activate nf - kappab in neurons leading to the altered expression of target genes and in some cases blocking the apoptosis pathway .
cxcr2 , which is the primary gro / kc receptor in neurons , has also been shown to activate the nf - kappab pathway in cardiac endothelial cells [ 47 ] .
to our knowledge , this is the first report of cxcr2 receptor using this pathway in neurons .
pannaccione et al [ 48 ] demonstrated that nf - kappab inhibitors block the increase in mrna and protein expression of kv3.4 and its regulatory accessory protein mink - related peptide 2 , as well as the increase in corresponding k currents , that are triggered by abeta peptide exposure in both pc - 12 cells and hippocampal neurons .
conclusion on the whole , our data suggest that gro / kc ( cxcl1 ) , which markedly increases in drg during the early phase of several models of pathological pain , has important effects in inflammatory processes via its direct actions on sensory neurons , and that activation of nf - kappab is involved in the gro / kc - induced enhancement of k currents .

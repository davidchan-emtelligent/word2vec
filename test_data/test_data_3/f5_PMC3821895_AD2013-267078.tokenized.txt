senescence is a normal biological process that occurs in all organisms and involves a decline in cell functions .
this process is caused by molecular regulatory machinery alterations , and it is closely related to telomere erosion in chromosomes .
in the context of the immune system , this phenomenon is known as immunosenescence and refers to the immune function deregulation .
therefore , functions of several cells involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses are severely compromised with age progression ( e.g. , changes in lymphocyte subsets , decreased proliferative responses , chronic inflammatory states , etc. ) .
these alterations make elderly individuals prone to not only infectious diseases but also to malignancy and autoimmunity .
this review will explore the molecular aspects of processes related to cell aging , their importance in the context of the immune system , and their participation in elderly sle patients .
1. introduction aging can be defined as the progressive decay of tissue functions which eventually results in organ dysfunction and death .
this decline may be the result of the loss of postmitotic cell function or the lack of replacement of such cells due to a decreased stem cell ability to maintain cell division and replication [ 1 ] .
if the organism suffers damage and it is irreparable , the senescence or aging process will take place by limiting the cells' proliferative potential .
some control mechanisms include differential gene expression which may be detrimental [ 2 ] .
however , there is a renewal mechanism that ensures damaged cell replacement .
this singular mechanism corresponds to a set of proliferating precursor cells that provide a source of cell replacement within the tissues .
the immune system provides an interesting case of replacement : cells that die by apoptosis are replaced by new ones , a process which is essential for immune system longevity and for adequate functionality .
this review will describe main molecular mechanisms implicated in immunosenescence and their relationship with autoimmune disease , particularly related to systemic lupus erythematous ( sle ) .
2. aging molecular mechanisms one of the most striking features of cell aging is its close relationship with telomere length [ 3 ] .
there is an inverse relationship between telomere length and cellular aging ; for example , very short telomeres force their cells to enter senescence .
human telomeres contain guanine - rich repetitive sequences ( i.e. , ttaggg ) which are gradually lost in each mitotic division .
this occurs by the fact that the dna polymerase is unable to replicate linear chromosomes in a process known as telomere erosion ( figure 1 ) [ 4 - 6 ] .
this process functions as a mitotic clock for which the length of the telomeres represents the number of cell divisions sustained by the cells [ 7 ] .
there is also a significant variability with respect to the speed and quality of aging between and within populations [ 8 ] .
this heterogeneity results from interaction between genetic , environmental , and stochastic factors .
in this regard , several epigenetic alterations have been associated with aging and diseases caused by aging ( e.g. , dna methylation state , histone modification , mirna , etc . )
[ 9 ] .
several studies about dna methylation have shown loss of methylcytosines with age , especially in cpg islands within alu repetitive sequences and endogenous retroviral sequences .
on top of this , a study of monozygotic twins showed that , for other young people , they retain similar methylation profiles while other twins who were between 50 and 60 years old had different methylation profiles and an h3 and h4 differential acetylation state [ 10 ] .
another mechanism related to epigenetic changes in aging involves chromatin remodeling .
this includes h3k9 , h3k27 , and h4k20 trimethylation , decreased h3k9 acetylation , and increased h3s10 phosphorylation [ 11 ] .
a decrease in h3k27 methylation together with an augmentation in h3s10 phosphorylation supports the idea of a change in the heterochromatin and euchromatin dynamics in aging cells .
in addition , there are several chromatin remodeling - related proteins that suffer alterations during aging .
these include the histone deacetylases ( hdacs ) , the sirtuin 1 ( sirt1 ) protein , and the histone methyltransferases [ 12 ] .
finally , several studies in both murine and humans have shown that mirnas may influence aging and longevity .
recently , multiple mirnas related to aging have been described including lin - 4 , mir - 1 , mir - 145 , mir - 140 , mir - 34a , and mir - 449th , and some of them modulate cell senescence critical molecules such as class i hdac , sirt1 , p21 , p53 , and prb .
another important mirna related to tcr signaling ( mir181a ) has serious implications in elderly people and autoimmunity ( this topic will be discussed later ) .
recently , liu et al. summarized the mirnas involved in cell senescence [ 13 ] .
3. immunosenescence one characteristic of elderly people is their inability to respond properly to vaccines and infections .
this condition could be the result of their low immune system efficiency [ 14 ] and occurs because of thymic involution in which the thymus loses its ability to produce and replace naive t cells on the periphery .
as a result , thymic dysfunction produces a decrease in cell - mediated response to foreign antigens , self - tolerance , and naive t - cell population .
in turn , it could increase the autoproliferation of t cells and eventually the induction of premature t - cell maturation which would also conduce to tolerance reduction [ 15 ] .
these alterations lead to not only modifications in lymphocyte subsets but also to functional changes in cell population subsets .
for instance , longitudinal studies have demonstrated an association between immunosenescence and an increase in cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) anergic cd8 t cells [ 16 ] .
one of the main characteristics of the immune system is the constant renewal of its cells .
at the same time , this renewal is highly dependent on the efficiency of telomere maintenance .
immune system cells are derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells that come from myeloid and lymphoid lineages .
these cells are constantly dividing and differentiating throughout their lifespan and that leads to changes in their telomere length .
note that a high rate of telomere loss in the first years of life has been observed , perhaps because of their high rate of mitotic division .
however , this telomere loss is not a linear process over time since , in older people , it is possible to find significant telomere erosion .
in fact , several studies have shown a decline in the length of telomeres with aging [ 17 ] .
a lot has been written regarding the relationship between aging , thymic degeneration , and changes in the bone marrow cells [ 18 - 20 ] .
however , we will focus only on immune senescence with an emphasis on circulating cell populations .
there are reports about age - related changes in peripheral blood cell populations : increase in monocytes , decreased lymphocytes , decrease in naive cells , and increase in memory cells ( table 1 ) [ 21 ] .
curiously , memory t cells ( cd4 + - cd45ro + and cd8 + - cd45ro +) increase with age and are preferentially located in tissue , whereas there is a similar proportion of cd45ra + and cd45ro + subsets in peripheral blood [ 22 ] .
unlike somatic cells , lymphocytes have a robust capability to proliferate given their clonal expansion and present an overexpression in the telomerase .
this process ensures no significant telomere shortening during each division .
interestingly , t cells possess several special features regarding their phenotype and their telomere length .
t - cell memory cells have shorter telomeres than naive t cells , and cd28 + t cells have longer telomeres than cd28 - t cells .
immune aging or immunosenescence not only affects adaptive response but also has implications in the innate response ( table 1 ) [ 23 ] .
it has been found that older individuals who exhibit a breakdown of their innate immune barriers such as epithelial skin barriers , lungs , and gastrointestinal tract could be vulnerable to a pathogen attack .
among the cell types involved in innate response , there are neutrophils , macrophages , and natural killer ( nk ) cells , which also suffer functional alterations through aging ( table 1 ) .
immunosenescence also affects the response to immunization .
there are several reports indicating low response to infectious agents in elderly individuals [ 24 , 25 ] .
latent proinflammatory status in old subjects is due to involution of thymus with subsequent alteration of function and balance of naive , effector , and memory cells .
this status combined with the presence of common and cumulative viral infections in the elderly ( such as cytomegalovirus and epstein - barr virus ) produces overall responses , loss of ability to control infectious diseases , and decreased response to vaccinations .
the cytokine environmental balance ( i.e. , decline in the infgamma : il - 10 ratio ) in challenge condition ( i.e. , influenza or other viral infections ) could decline the cd8 + cytotoxic ability , thus conducing to high il - 10 response to virus challenge .
therefore , vaccines that arouse inflammatory cytokines would be expected to enhance protection in elderly subjects .
3.1 .
adaptive immune response 3.1.1 .
t cells t lymphocytes suffer alterations due to aging .
most of the observed changes are attributed to alterations during the initial activation step of the t - cell receptor ( tcr ) .
there is evidence of alteration in the downstream signaling of the tcr in the case of elderly people .
this includes a decrease in intracellular free calcium , deficiencies in protein kinase c translocation , low lck , zap70 activation , nfat impairment , nf - kappab translocation , low ras - mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathways , and a decrease in proteasome activity , [ 26 ] .
these alterations have been demonstrated in both naive and memory t cells [ 27 ] .
tcr has the function to discriminate between self - antigens and respond to foreign peptides .
this is caused by its activation threshold level , and therefore , the loss of tcr sensitivity is closely related to aging .
as mentioned before , there is an important microrna - - named mir - 181a - - implicated in this phenomenon which controls the expression of several phosphatases related to the negative regulation of proximal cd4 tcr signaling events .
indeed , in a murine model , mir181a overexpression lowers tcr activation threshold and restores tcr ability to respond to autoantigens [ 28 ] .
note that mir - 181a expression declines throughout life and shows a significant loss after the age of 70 [ 29 ] .
another interesting point is that there are reports indicating changes in gene expression of surface molecules on t cells .
changes in surface molecules may have a negative impact on t - cell activation by increasing phosphatase expression such as dusp family .
furthermore , a study evaluated the effect of aging on surface molecule gene expression and found that il - 6r , cd8 , cd27 , and cd28 are downregulated while ilt2 ( cd85j ) , klrg , kir , cd44 , cd96 , klrf1 , and cd94 are upregulated [ 30 , 31 ] .
some of these molecules ( ilt , klrg , and kir ) function as negative regulators of tcr activation and proliferation ( at least in murine models ) or as specific molecules of particular t cells such as cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) peptide - specific t cells ( kir and ilt2 ) .
they also appear to be related to t - cell exhaustion although the relationship between aging , senescent , and exhausted t - cell gene expressions seems to be different ( figure 2 ) .
an excellent review of this topic was done by cavanagh et al .
[ 32 ] .
in addition to surface molecule gene expression alteration , there are other processes related to tcr signaling alteration and aging .
for instance , it is well known that a cell - intrinsic environment ( ros species , dna damage ) and a cell - extrinsic environment ( cytokines ) both modulate tcr responses , and they are also altered in the elderly .
moreover , studies have shown that increased oxidative stress produces displacement of lat from the cell membrane , thus inhibiting tcr signaling .
along with this , activated cd4 t cells from aging humans express increased levels of metallothoineins , which are an important redox system [ 34 ] .
additionally , there are alterations in molecules that participate in nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling pathways such as dna repair kinases ( atm , atr , and dna - pkcs ) , which are activated not only by dna double - strand breaks ( dsb ) but also by telomere attrition ( as we will see later ) .
both of them are related to activation of dna repair kinases ( atm , atr and dna - pkcs ) [ 35 ] .
host environment and specific cytokine profiles have enormous implications in the t - cell signaling threshold .
some cytokines such as il - 7 , il - 21 , and il15 have been studied in this regard .
these cytokines signal through pi3k , stat3 , and stat5 [ 36 ] and participate in erk pathway activation .
note that il - 7 and il - 15 have profound implications in lymphopenia development in ra animal models .
this has been shown through the fact that when animals are primed with il - 7 or il - 15 , t - cell response to autoantigens is enabled .
in addition , another cytokine implicated in signaling alteration during aging is the il - 6 .
this cytokine has implications in the jak - stat pathway through activation of socs3 transcription .
note that stat molecules are highly phosphorylated in elderly humans , a phenomenon that also occurs through type i interferon t - cell activation [ 35 ] .
as was discussed previously , telomere attrition is very frequent in elderly people and it is also known that t - cell replication is important for maintaining lymphocyte function .
this suggests that t - cells employ the best mechanisms for telomere maintenance during clonal expansion .
indeed , there is evidence that telomerase activity is highly regulated during t lymphocyte development and differentiation [ 37 ] .
the resting cd4 + and cd8 + and naive t cells recorded no telomerase activity on the periphery .
however , the telomerase is activated by lymphocyte stimulation .
the level of telomerase activity decreases during successive stimulations of the lymphocyte ( figure 3 ) [ 38 ] .
the rate of telomere shortening seems to be different among cd4 + and cd8 + cells , and it has been estimated to be 33 bp / year for cd4 + t cells and 26 bp / year for cd8 + t cells .
one of the most outstanding features of aged cd4 + naive t cells is their inability to produce significant levels of il - 2 after stimulation of their t - cell receptor ( tcr ) .
this inability subsequently leads to poor th1 / th2 polarization .
however , these cells may retain their ability to suffer th17 differentiation [ 39 , 40 ] , which , in turn , could favor an inflammatory and autoimmune phenotype development .
on the other hand , the number of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + regulatory t cells ( treg ) increases ( 2.4 - fold ) , and they retain and gain functions during aging .
nonetheless , their ability to produce il - 10 is low .
they may also contribute to th17 bias ( production of high levels of il - 17 , il - 21 , and il - 22 ) and show a decrease in antitumor responses too [ 40 ] .
meanwhile , aging cd8 + lymphocytes show a reduction in the diversity of the tcr repertoire , low antitumor response , and marked clonal expansion development but without the ability to replicate after stimulation [ 26 ] .
note that th2 inflammatory cytokines favor antibody production by b cells , and this condition could explain autoantibodies in the aged population .
one of the most important traits of immune aging is the loss of the cd28 surface marker .
cd28 is one of the molecules expressed in t cells that provide costimulatory signals that are required for t - cell activation , t - cell proliferation , cytokine production , and t - cell survival promotion .
loss of cd28 expression is a phenotypic change associated with senescence in t lymphocytes , and it has been associated with functional alterations such as enhanced cytotoxicity , suppressive functions , and resistance of cd4 + t cells to apoptosis .
loss of cd28 expression is characterized by telomere shortening and reduced proliferative ability , both ex vivo and in vitro [ 41 , 42 ] .
at birth , virtually all t cells express cd28 , but with age , the marker decreases about 40 to 50 % for cd8 + t cells and 85 to 90 % for cd4 + .
this reduction in the markers is attributed to repeated antigenic stimulation in peripheral blood [ 43 ] .
however , when the cd28 is lost , cells suffer reprograming and , as a consequence , they express new receptors such as kir , cd70 , and perforin .
moreover , phenotypic cd28 - t - cell characteristics include interferon gamma ( ifn - gamma ) production , potent cytotoxic capability , and cd158 , cd158b , cd158j , dap12 , cd94 , and cd244 receptor expression ( similar to nk cell characteristics ) .
these receptors give them the potential to interact with accessory cells such as mesenchymal cells , which include the fibroblasts of inflamed joints [ 44 ] .
furthermore , in elderly individuals with chronic viral infections and autoimmune diseases ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , and wegener 's disease ) , an increase in the frequency of cd28 - t cells has been detected [ 43 ] .
it has been suggested that autoantigens can lead to clonal expansion of these cells .
thus , there are reports [ 45 , 46 ] indicating how they can , for instance , show reactivity to myelin basic protein ( mbp ) .
the presence of cd4 + cd28 - t cells in both elderly individuals and patients with autoimmune diseases ( ads ) has supported the concept that ads are closely related to the cell aging process .
in this regard , the loss of cd28 molecule could favor ctla - 4 interaction with their ligands ( cd80 and cd86 ) , which are implicated in autoimmune phenotype too .
the main differential and functional alterations of cd4 + and cd8 + t - cell subsets are summarized in figure 4 .
3.1.2 .
b cells it is known that with aging , there is a decrease in not only the frequency and absolute number of pro - b cells but also in their ability to differentiate into pre - b ( between 60 and 90 %) .
nevertheless , in healthy individuals , mature peripheral b - cell numbers do not change with aging ; instead the relationship between naive and memory cells is altered ; that is , there is an increase in long - lived memory cells ( homeostatic expansion of antigen - experienced or activated b cells ) and a decrease in naive cells [ 47 ] .
this condition seems to depend on different factors other than genetic ones .
a study comparing old individuals with healthy centenarian offspring could determine that centenarian offspring have more igd + cd27 - naive b cells than older people .
nevertheless , the double negative memory cells ( igd - cd27 - b cells ) are only found in healthy elderly individuals , and there are no differences between groups [ 48 ] .
recently , studies have reported a novel peripheral b - cell subset in the elderly named aging - associated b - cell ( abc ) subset ( cd19 + cd11b + cd11c +) [ 49 ] .
in vitro , the abc subset responds only to innate stimuli producing secretion of autoantibodies and cytokines , and this subset also has the ability to potentiate th17 polarization , thus relating it to an autoimmune phenotype .
another important fact is the presence of alterations in the repertoire of the b - cell receptor ( bcr ) , which exhibits a decreased affinity and diversity to the antibody response with aging [ 33 ] .
indeed , elderly patients have impaired b - cell proliferation and activation , possibly as a result of defects in their threshold of activation [ 26 ] .
also , there is a loss of precision in distinguishing self - from non - self - antigens due to the oligoclonal expansion of the b lymphocyte subpopulation with a high proportion of antigen - experienced cells [ 50 ] .
this subpopulation expresses cd5 on their surface , thus giving them the ability to produce low affinity antibodies independently of t cells .
in the context of autoantibody generation , this is important for triggering an autoimmune response .
moreover , the germinal centers ( gc ) from elderly people are small and have few cells producing igm .
in these individuals , levels of immunoglobulins , especially iga and igg , are increased [ 51 ] .
furthermore , it has been shown that igg +/ iga + b - cell subsets ( both cd27 + and cd27 - ) express ig mutated genes in their variable regions and high levels of cd80 and cd86 on their surface , thus exhibiting a similar b - cell memory phenotype [ 52 ] .
according to the reports , this subtype of cells declines with aging [ 51 ] .
finally , aging b cells have been observed to produce antibodies with low avidity because of their somatic hypermutation deterioration which leads to a gradual decline in the humoral response .
nevertheless , repertory changes are not synchronous with aging , and decreased diversity has been related to poor health status [ 53 ] .
an interesting study [ 54 ] done to evaluate naive ( cd19 + cd27 - ) and memory ( cd19 + cd27 +) switch b - cell subsets in elderly individuals showed a decrease in total b cells , and , although the quantity of naive cells increased in percentage , they decreased or remained constant in number .
moreover , another striking result is that the b - cell memory ( cd27 +) increased in percentage but not significantly .
in contrast , memory cells producing igm subtype decreased in number but not in percentage .
finally , the memory switch cells decreased both in number and percentage with aging .
an interesting point about memory b cells is that they have a hyporesponsive state to antigen - induced activation with less clonal expansion or less ability to differentiate into antibody secreting cells [ 55 ] .
this condition may be caused by the decreasing number of antibody high affinity b cells that elderly people have .
taken together , these results indicate that there is an accumulation of antigen - experienced b subsets in aging individuals .
in these cases , overall b - cell numbers are unchanged , but they vary in their functional abilities ( figure 5 ) .
3.2 .
innate immune response 3.2.1 .
dendritic cells dendritic cells ( dcs ) are important because they function as a checkpoint between immunity and tolerance .
dcs from aging individuals display a basal level of activation , increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf - alpha and il - 6 [ 56 ] , and high levels of nf - kappab activation .
however , they do not exhibit upregulation of cd86 and cd80 molecules on their surface , which suggests that they are partially activated .
another important characteristic is that they are more reactive to self - antigens compared with their young counterparts and display an impaired clearance of apoptotic cells and antigens [ 57 ] .
this could produce a higher presentation of self - antigens and , consequently , an activation of autoreactive lymphocytes .
an interesting point is that these partially activated dcs have a greater ability to stimulate t cells , thus indicating that their ability to induce tolerance to self - antigens is affected .
some explanations have been given regarding partially activated dcs : ( 1 ) an increased age - associated level of proinflammatory mediators and ( 2 ) age - associated modifications in autoantigens , which increase their immunogenicity [ 58 ] .
note that the functions of myeloid dcs ( mdcs ) such as il - 12 production , chemotaxis , and their ability to activate naive cd4 t cells via antigen presentation appear to be altered in elderly individuals [ 57 ] .
this inability is due to decreased pi3k activation [ 59 ] , which leads to activation of nf - kappab , as it was previously mentioned .
this subtype of dcs also shows decreased capability in their antigen processing and increased expression of cd86 .
plasmacytoid dcs ( pdcs ) from elderly people , in turn , have reduced ifn i and ifn iii production after stimulation via toll - like receptor ( tlr ) [ 60 ] .
additionally , they have an impaired ability for antigen presentation to cd4 and cd8 t cells .
3.2.2 .
neutrophils neutrophils are the first immune cells that are recruited to the site of infection or to the tissue damage [ 61 ] .
besides , there is a debate about whether the numbers of neutrophils change with age , but a variety of studies suggest that there are no number changes .
however , there are reports indicating several functional defects in neutrophils from the elderly [ 62 , 63 ] .
the main function decreased in neutrophils is the chemotaxis , followed by the phagocytic activity .
both of them affect the time needed for the neutrophils to reach the infection site and their ability to control the infections , respectively [ 62 , 64 , 65 ] .
these two alterations are closely related to increased infections in elderly subjects .
low phagocytic activity has been associated with reduced surface expression of the fcgamma receptor cd16 [ 64 ] .
signaling function of other receptors involved in activation such as fmlp , tlr , retinoic - acid - inducible - gene - 1 - protein - ( rig - 1 - ) like helicases ( rlrs ) , nucleotide binding domain and leucine - rich - repeat - containing proteins ( nlrs ) , and c3b has been reported to be significantly altered .
this alteration is due to changes in signaling molecules but not in the number of their receptors [ 66 , 67 ] .
some downstream signaling events include phosphoinositide - 3 kinase ( pi - 3 k ) , map kinase , calcium , protein kinase b , and shp - 1 and jak - stat pathways [ 68 ] .
interestingly , these alterations are produced by changes in membrane composition including lipid rafts distribution and their structure [ 69 , 70 ] .
3.2.3 .
nk and nkt cells nk cells participate in the innate immune defense against intracellular pathogens and tumor cells , and they mediate mhc - independent cytotoxicity .
there are several studies indicating a remodeling of these cells in elderly individuals .
the percentage and absolute number of nk cells are increased in healthy aging , and they are characterized by the increment of cd57 expression and expansion of cd56dim nk cells ( mature and highly differentiated cells ) [ 71 , 72 ] .
other important features of these cells from aging subjects are decreased proliferative response to cytokines , altered expression of some nk receptors such as natural cytotoxicity receptors ( ncrs ) [ 73 ] , cd226 [ 74 ] , and klrg - 1 [ 75 ] , and increased expression of hla - specific killer immunoglobulin - like receptor [ 73 ] .
at functional level , cytotoxic and proliferation ability and cytokines / chemokines ( such as infgamma , rantes , mip1a , and il8 ) production of nk cells are reduced [ 76 ] .
nkt cells are important in the clearance of bacterial and viral infections as well as in regulation of immune tolerance and autoimmunity [ 77 ] .
nkt cells are characterized by expression of a tcr encoded by valpha14 / vbeta8.2 gene segments .
the effects of aging on nkt cell number and function have been little studied .
in general , nowadays , it is accepted that the absolute number of nkts within the lymphoid organ increases [ 78 ] .
in addition , there are reports that show a decrease of proliferative ability and low number of cd1d - restricted nkt cells in the peripheral blood [ 79 ] .
studies of inhibition of nkt cell activation demonstrated age - associated decay of proliferative response and retarded type hypersensitivity responses [ 80 ] ; in addition , results showed that nkt cells contribute to increments of il - 4 and il - 10 production and decreased ifn - gamma in aging subjects [ 81 ] .
3.2.4 .
monocyte / macrophages other essential components of innate immune response are macrophages and monocytes .
monocytes respond to inflammation by their differentiation into macrophages and dendritic cells .
studies have demonstrated that cd56 + monocytes subpopulation ( high producers of tnf - alpha via tlrs 2 and 4 ) is increased with age while their counterpart ( cd56 - ) is decreased [ 82 ] .
the increment of cd56 + monocytes is paradoxical with the alteration in macrophage tlr function .
a study revealed a decrease in il - 6 and tnf - alpha via tlr1 / 2 in the elderly , and this fact was related to the decrease of tlr1 on monocyte surface [ 83 ] .
these results are contradictory with another report which indicates substantial increase of the same cytokines [ 21 ] .
thus , this issue required further confirmation , which can be accomplished by the study of phenotype subpopulations ( according to the expression levels of the receptors and proteins ) .
in this regard , age - associated changes in tlrs expression on monocytes have been performed [ 84 ] .
a particular study showed that old patients infected with west nile virus have a persistent tlr3 expression on macrophages' surface while young patients have reduced expression of this receptor [ 85 ] .
this feature may produce a higher inflammatory response with the subsequent increased morbidity of elderly subjects .
furthermore , there are reports about age - related upregulation of cd80 molecule on monocytes after tlr activation [ 86 ] which is associated with production of a protective response to influenza vaccination .
another important age - associated feature of both monocytes and macrophages is that several of their receptors become altered , thus producing cells dysfunction .
this produces that clearance of free radical production and phagocytosis are reduced in monocyte / macrophages in the elderly [ 87 ] .
also , these alterations may lead to deregulation in clearing of apoptotic cells by macrophages , thus precipitating the exacerbation of inflammatory - aging condition .
4. infection and immunosenescence to produce an adequate response to large numbers of pathogens throughout life , there are homeostatic mechanisms guaranteeing competent memory and a naive cell pool for prolonging the survival of memory cells .
however , under the conditions of advanced age , these mechanisms are seriously affected .
as we have seen , during aging , many changes occur in the immune system , which means that immunosenescence becomes a factor contributing significantly to a higher risk and severity of infections .
the most important diseases in the elderly are urinary tract infections , influenza and pneumonia , chronic viral infection reactivation ( herpes virus and varicella - zoster virus ) , as well as bacterial ( tuberculosis ) , fungal ( candidiasis ) , or parasitic infections , and , more rarely , opportunistic infections such as clostridium and staphylococcus [ 88 , 89 ] .
although the immune response to antigens may be preserved in elderly individuals , their ability to be immunized against new antigens is reduced .
this may be the result of an increase in the proportion of memory cells and progressive decrease in naive cells from the thymus [ 90 ] .
while it is true that aging is associated with the emergence of infectious diseases , it is also true that these infectious events will promote aging .
it is well known that viral infections ( particularly the herpes virus family ) are strong stressors which alter the lymphocyte phenotype and functionality , altered cytokine profile , resistance to apoptosis , and shortened telomeres [ 91 ] .
these features are similar to those found in the elderly ; thus it is possible that viral infections could represent an important extrinsic factor for aging by the repeated antigen stimulation characteristic of persistent latent infections [ 92 ] .
furthermore , it has been suggested that latent herpes virus infections are primarily responsible for in vivo generation of senescent cd8 + t cells , perhaps due to constant and prolonged virus - specific t - cell proliferation [ 93 ] .
additionally , the epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) latent infection has also been associated with telomere shortening in antigen - specific cd8 - t cells because ebv antigens cause a decrease in telomerase activity associated with t - cell proliferation [ 94 ] .
in contrast ( and related to telomere erosion and its relationship with cd28 molecule expression ) , the majority of t cells in a study done by vescocini were cd28 + unlike what was found for cmv , which were mainly cd28 - [ 95 ] .
during human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection , in turn , it has been reported that early presence of cd8 + cd28 - t cells is a predictive characteristic of rapid disease progression [ 96 ] .
these data indicate that chronic infections during aging produce significant changes in the cd8 + cell subset .
additionally , this shows that expansion of cd28 - t cells is age dependent , and they have a positive correlation with proinflammatory cytokines .
at the same time , these cytokines are heavily involved in the pathogenesis of immunological disorders which could favor the emergence of different pathologies including ads .
5. autoimmune disease currently , it is clear that changes occurring in the immune system during aging affect the onset of ads .
this is due to the fact that aging is related to increased reactivity to self - antigens and loss of tolerance .
the overall tendency supports this hypothesis because elderly people experience general systemic inflammation and , at the same time , they aggravate degenerative diseases [ 97 ] , which , in turn , increase the risk of developing ads [ 98 , 99 ] .
proinflammatory cytokines on general systemic inflammation ( produced by viral infection ) lead to a state called inflammaging , which corresponds to the loss of equilibrium between adequate inflammatory response and efficient anti - inflammatory control in the elderly condition .
later , in normal aging , this control fails to fully neutralize the inflammatory processes .
in addition to this , it is important to remember ( as we have seen previously ) the epigenetic changes occurring in elderly people and how these may affect important genes involved in autoimmune disorder development [ 100 ] .
in this regard , there are reports in which some genes associated with ads are hypermethylated but others are hypomethylated .
for instance , foxp3 , a hypermethylated gene , is a member of the forkhead transcription regulator family [ 101 ] and is associated with the development of multiple ads .
in contrast , the gene coding for the cd11a chain of lymphocyte function - associated antigen 1 ( lfa - 1 ) - - a protein which is associated with certain ads - - is hypomethylated with age and thus overexpressed in aging cells [ 100 ] .
furthermore , there are other reports on elderly subjects indicating dna hypomethylation states which could lead to an increase in the immunogenicity [ 58 ] another important aspect of aging that is closely related to autoimmunity in general and ads in particular is the increase in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tnf - alpha , c - reactive protein , il - 8 , mcp1 , and rantes [ 102 - 104 ] .
there is a substantial amount of evidence of age - associated alterations in the t - cell cytokine profile which could contribute to development of ads .
studies have shown that there is a change from th1 to th2 molecules ( mainly il - 4 and il - 6 ) in the cytokine profile as age advances [ 105 ] .
il - 6 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine closely related to disability in patients with ra ; therefore , il - 6 represents a therapeutic target for this disease [ 106 ] .
in addition , there are reports of an imbalance between th17 and treg cells .
a considerable number of il - 17 - secreting naive cd4 + t helper cells have been detected in the elderly in contrast to reduced il - 17 - secreting memory cd4 + t helper cells [ 107 ] .
some ads are very frequent in younger patients and are not limited to elderly people although the occurrence or presence of autoantibodies is greater at advanced age [ 108 - 111 ] .
autoantibody production such as rheumatoid factor , as well as antinuclear , antiphospholipid , and antithyroglobulin antibodies , is present during aging [ 109 , 112 ] .
autoantibody production has been attributed to altered t - and b - cell functions [ 113 ] , especially to the decrease in antibody affinity maturation .
this evidence supports the idea that autoantibody levels may be closely related to the clinical characteristics of the elderly and to patients with ads .
one of the important causes of dysfunctional immune responses is telomere abnormalities which may lead to autoimmunity .
this observation is significant since numerous studies have shown an association between mean telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) and different diseases [ 91 ] .
this evidence suggests an increase in cd8 + cd28 - t - cell proportions in several pathologies such as in the case of some ads .
moreover , there are reports of telomere length alteration in patients with ads such as ra [ 114 , 115 ] , scleroderma ( ssc ) [ 116 ] , systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) [ 117 ] , polyangiitis with granulomatosis [ 118 ] , psoriasis , and atopic dermatitis [ 119 ] , suggesting an excessive cell replication with their corresponding telomere erosion .
these findings have been interpreted as evidence of t - cell accelerated proliferation in the autoimmune process .
at present , it is believed that there are differences among telomere abnormalities and various ads .
some of these differences could be explained by the genetic background of the individuals studied .
for example , a study performed in patients with ssc and their family members reported short telomeres [ 116 ] .
the idea of a genetic predisposition to telomere shortening is also suggested in patients with ra , who exhibit telomere erosion in not only memory cells but also in naive cells .
moreover , this evidence shows acceleration in telomere erosion occurring at the precursor cell level [ 120 ] .
another striking fact is that the genetic predisposition to short telomeres is strongly related to hla - dr4 haplotype which is shared by ra and t1d in some individuals [ 121 , 122 ] .
5.1 .
late - onset systemic lupus erythematous although sle is considered a disease of the reproductive stage of women , there is evidence that it occurs between 3 and 18 % in individuals older than 50 years [ 123 ] .
despite that there are aged sle patients , their clinical manifestations , response to treatment , prognosis , and course of the disease are different in these individuals ( figure 6 ) .
for example , clinical manifestations such as malar rash , renal disease , arthritis , and photosensitivity are less frequent in them , while serositis , cytopenias , and pulmonary involvement are more frequent [ 124 - 127 ] .
in addition , it has been shown that female / male ( f / m ) sex ratio declines with age .
studies report f / m ratio from 2.5 to 9 in elderly individuals compared to from 9.1 to 14.4 in young people [ 126 , 128 ] .
a striking feature of these patients is the differential diagnosis due to the sle overlapping with other diseases .
late - onset rheumatoid arthritis , endocarditis , tuberculosis , neoplasia , polymyalgia rheumatica , temporal arteritis , and sjogren 's syndrome ( ss ) had been described is these patients [ 124 , 127 ] .
in the particular case of ss , elderly patients with sle and without ss have low frequency of compromising renal disease , lymphadenopathy , and thrombocytopenia and high frequency of raynaud 's phenomenon [ 129 ] .
besides changes in clinical and serological profiles , serological profiles of aged sle patients also exhibit alterations [ 124 ] .
compared to younger individuals , elderly patients with sle have high frequency of rheumatoid factor ( 33 % versus 20 %) and antinuclear antibodies but low frequency of antiribonucleoprotein ( anti - rnp , 10 % versus 21 %) and anti - sm ( 9 % versus 17 %) .
there are reports that indicate contradictory results [ 130 ] , but these differences can be explained by different reasons : ethnicity , sample size , methodology , and so forth .
an important fact is that the severity of the disease appears to decrease with age .
it has been reported that late - onset sle patients have milder disease course which is reflected in a small number of relapses per patient .
additionally , it was found that the prevalence of lupus nephritis and nephrotic syndrome also is lower in elderly patients .
currently , it is not clear if there is a relationship between telomere loss and sle .
some studies have shown an increased telomere erosion in sle patients [ 100 , 101 , 131 , 132 ] , while others report normal telomere length when compared with healthy controls [ 102 , 103 ] .
nevertheless , it is clear that there is a reduction in telomerase activity in naive cd4 + t cells and an increased activity in b cells [ 101 , 103 ] .
in this regard , a recent study showed a differential expression of shelterin complex molecules in patients with lupus [ 104 ] , but , unfortunately , it was not done cell specific .
according to the report of [ 132 ] , shorter telomeres are associated with ro antibodies while longer ones with steroid therapy and increased body mass index .
however this study also showed that short telomeres are not related to disease activity or immune cell turnover , but they could be good predictors of premature aging .
related to this topic , previous studies have indicated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( bmscs ) from sle patients exhibit not only increased apoptosis and senescence but also impaired capacity of differentiation , immune modulation , proliferation , and secretion of cytokines .
apoptosis and senescence in bmscs from sle patients appear , to be due to increased favorable conditions for these processes .
there were described increased levels of p16ink4a , bax , caspase 8 , fas and tumor necrosis factor - a receptor 1 , and the respective ligands of the two last .
there is also a decreased expression of bcl - 2 , cdk4 , cdk6 , and p - rb [ 133 , 134 ] .
programmed cell death ( pcd ) is an essential mechanism of homeostasis and development and it is very important as an immune response regulator .
hence appropriate clearance of apoptotic cells in the immune system is necessary for regulating inflammation and maintaining self - tolerance .
impaired clearance of apoptotic cells in patients with sle is considered an important process in the etiology of lupus [ 135 ] .
this phenomenon is exacerbated in older age , and its deficiencies may account for the development of autoimmunity by the loss of tolerance in lymphoid tissues .
this process is mediated by phagocytes and , as it was mentioned before , in elderly subjects ; phagocytic functions of macrophages are altered .
this functional deregulation may generate danger signals , followed by concomitant exposure of autoantigens and the subsequent autoimmune reaction .
another mechanism that is related to development of lupus is the molecular mimicry in which b and t cells are activated as a result of an infection .
this mechanism makes cells able to recognize self - molecules that are similar to infectious agent molecules , thus originating an autoimmune response [ 136 - 139 ] .
in sle , this response is associated with high levels of anti - sm autoantibodies due to similar molecular sequence of pathogenic molecules of cmv and ebv , which develop the initial immune response .
although anti - sm autoantibodies are less frequent in the elderly than in younger individuals , it may be possible that ebv infection - - exacerbated with age - - can contribute not only to inflammaging development but also to induction , by molecular mimicry , of an immune response towards itself .
further studies in this topic could be interesting .
abnormalities in tcr signaling which have been documented in sle patients are similar to those in ra patients .
this may also be related to the elderly ; for instance , tcr zeta chain expression is defective in these patients [ 105 ] .
6. concluding remarks aging is a natural physiological process that could eventually conduce to increases in some pathological conditions .
a lot of changes are detected in the immune system of elderly individuals which could contribute to the occurrence of complications such as infection , autoimmunity , and autoimmune disorders .
in this regard , it is important to remember that elderly patients with sle have different clinical and serological manifestations and poorer prognosis comparing with young patients ( less insidious onset disease , more occurrences of severe manifestations , and higher frequency of comorbid conditions ) .
thus it is necessary to implement a proper immunological recognition of these patients in order to produce adequate therapeutic management which must be different because the treatment itself may cause long - term damage .

the mechanisms contributing to the loss of telomere length include genetic defects , chronic viral infections , defects in repair machinery , aging , and stress .
figure 2 changes in the t - cell pool and individual cells during aging .
a proportion of t subsets depends on individual infection antecedents and the environment .
memory t - cell subset can change to senescence by a chronic latent infection and chronic tcr stimulation .
meanwhile , exhausted t cells are produced by the same type of stimulation and the chronic acute infection .
aged naive cells are generated from naive cells stimulated by self - antigen exposure ( adapted from [ 32 ]) .
figure 3 schematic representation of t - cell divisions and their implication in telomere erosion and aging .
constantly dividing cells are accompanied by a decrease in their telomere length , which is related to aging phenotype : decreased bim expression , increased naive lifespan , and important functional changes .
figure 4 aged - related functional changes in t - cell subsets .
alterations are produced in both memory and naive subsets .
these alterations depend on t - cell microenvironmental history , exposures to stressor agents , and stochastic events .
there are differences in changes between cd4 + and cd8 + concerning aging , but in both cases , there is reduction of naive subtype , increase in lifespan , and defective immune response .
figure 5 age - related changes in the generation and function of b cells .
there is a reduced output of b cells in the bone marrow , which induces accumulations in the periphery of antigen - experienced subsets with poor immune response and low diversity .
hsc : hematopoietic stem cell ; bcr : b - cell receptor ; bm : bone marrow ( adapted from [ 33 ]) .
figure 6 general characteristics of late - onset sle .
there are different manifestations of older sle patients compared to young patients .

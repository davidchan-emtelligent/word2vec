however , it remains a major clinical concern for promoting high - efficiency and high - quality osseointegration of pti , which is beneficial for securing long - term implant stability .
accumulating evidence demonstrates the capacity of low - amplitude whole - body vibration ( wbv ) in preventing osteopenia , whereas the effects and mechanisms of wbv on osteogenesis and osseointegration of pti remain unclear .
our present study shows that wbv enhanced cellular attachment and proliferation , and induced well - organized cytoskeleton of primary osteoblasts in pti .
wbv upregulated osteogenesis - associated gene and protein expression in primary osteoblasts , including ocn , runx2 , wnt3a , lrp6 and beta - catenin .
in vivo findings demonstrate that 6 - week and 12 - week wbv stimulated osseointegration , bone ingrowth and bone formation rate of pti in rabbit femoral bone defects via muct , histological and histomorphometric analyses .
wbv induced higher alp , ocn , runx2 , bmp2 , wnt3a , lrp6 and beta - catenin , and lower sost and rankl / opg gene expression in rabbit femora .
our findings demonstrate that wbv promotes osteogenesis and osseointegration of pti via its anabolic effect and potential anti - catabolic activity , and imply the promising potential of wbv for enhancing the repair efficiency and quality of pti in osseous defects .
treatment of osseous defects caused by tumor resection , trauma , infection , or osteo - degenerative diseases imposes tremendous socioeconomic burdens .
despite of extensive clinical use of autograft and allograft as bone substitutes , the tissue availability , donor site morbidity or immunological rejection remains to be their major limitations12 .
titanium and titanium alloys have exhibited their superiority as load - bearing metal implants because of the excellent biocompatibility and corrosion resistance3 .
however , the mechanical mismatch between titanium implants and surrounding natural bones leads to the stress - shielding effect and accelerates bone resorption , and thus increases the risk of implant loosening4 .
titanium alloys with porous structures show structural similarity with cancellous bones and also provide favorable pore channels for the transport of nutrients and metabolites567 .
however , titanium - based materials are bioinert which are more easily connected with natural bones in the form of mechanical interlock rather than chemical bonding478 .
inadequate osseointegration of titanium alloys remains to be a major clinical limitation , which fails to assure the early fixation and secure long - term stability of implants , especially for osteoporotic patients910 .
thus , developing novel techniques to speed up osseointegration of titanium implants holds great clinical significance for increasing the repair efficiency and quality of bone defects .
the skeleton is a highly adaptive system to load bearing which remodels its own structure in response to the external mechanical cues .
exercise or physical activity increases bone quantity and / or quality , whereas lack of skeletal loading results in prominent degradation of bone mass .
substantial evidence over the past decade has revealed that whole - body vibration ( wbv ) with low intensity (< 50 muepsilon ) and high frequency ( 20 - 100 hz ) might become a promising surrogate of physical exercise in the promotion of bone growth .
it has been shown that wbv has the capacity of increasing bone mass and quality in both normal and osteoporotic animals induced by ovariectomy , disuse or glucocorticoids11121314151617 .
clinical investigations have substantiated that wbv promoted bone mineral density ( bmd ) in young and postmenopausal women181920 .
studies have also shown the efficiency of the wbv treatment in the promotion of fracture healing of animal long bones2122 .
due to the low cost , low side effects , simplicity , short duration , and noninvasive nature , wbv represents significant advances over the physical exercise and existing pharmacologically anabolic or anti - catabolic reagents in the preservation of bone density and strength .
however , critical questions regarding whether the wbv treatment is able to promote bone ingrowth and accelerate osseointegration of porous metallic implants in animals with bone defect remain unanswered yet .
in the present study , we systematically investigated the potential effects of wbv stimulation on the biological performance of pti both in vitro and in vivo .
first , osteoblastic activities and functions in vitro in pti under the stimulation of wbv were critically assessed .
then , we evaluated the efficiency of wbv in bone ingrowth through the pore channels and peri - implant osseointegration .
finally , the molecular signaling pathway mechanisms of wbv stimulation on in vitro and in vivo osteogenesis in pti implants were also investigated .

results in vitro osteoblastic attachment , proliferation , mineralization and morphology in pti primary rabbit osteoblasts exhibited the fusiform , triangle or polygonal shape with round or oval nucleus , and also demonstrated positive in alp and mineralization nodules staining ( data not shown ) .
as shown in fig. 2a , mechanical vibration stimulation significantly promoted osteoblastic proliferation via mtt analysis ( p < 0.05 ) .
images by sem scanning showed that primary osteoblasts were attached to the substrate of titanium alloy more tightly and proliferated with many more pseudopodia in pti under the stimulation of mechanical vibration ( fig. 2b ) .
moreover , mechanical vibration stimulation significantly increased osteoblastic attachment in pti as compared with the control group via dapi staining ( fig. 2c , p < 0.05 ) .

muct analysis for in vivo osseointegration of pti representative 3 - d muct images ( fig. 5a ) demonstrate that the amount of newly formed bone within the pti implant was significantly increased after 6 - week or 12 - week wbv stimulation in comparison with the control group .
representative 2 - d mid - coronal and mid - sagittal slices further reveal that wbv stimulation for 6 weeks and 12 weeks significantly promoted bone ingrowth through the pores of pti .
moreover , wbv stimulation resulted in higher levels of bv / tv ( p < 0.05 , + 133.5 % at 6 weeks and + 118.1 % at 12 weeks ) and tb.n ( p < 0.05 , + 63.4 % at 6 weeks and + 37.5 % at 12 weeks ) as revealed by statistical comparisons ( fig. 5b ) .
wbv also significantly decreased bs / bv ( p < 0.05 , - 30.8 % at 6 weeks and - 43.0 % at 12 weeks ) and tb.sp ( p < 0.05 , - 61.3 % at 6 weeks and - 55.7 % at 12 weeks ) as compared with the control group .
in addition , wbv exposure also resulted in minor increase of tb.th at 6 weeks ( p = 0.536 , + 17.2 %) and 12 weeks ( p = 0.219 , + 33.2 %) .
histological and histomorphometric evaluation for in vivo osseointegration of pti as shown in fig. 6a , masson - goldner trichrome staining images revealed that 6 - week and 12 - week wbv stimulation stimulated more new trabecular bone ingrowth through the pores of pti in the region of bone defects .
the findings were further confirmed by the statistically significant increase of bone area fractions after 6 - week and 12 - week wbv exposure as compared with the control group ( fig. 6b , p < 0.05 , + 92.2 % at 6 weeks and + 112.1 % at 12 weeks ) .

furthermore , the mrna expression levels of the canonical wnt signaling , including wnt3a , lrp6 and beta - catenin in the wbv group were also significantly higher than those in the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
discussion titanium alloys with porous structure have the capacity of providing favorable environment for the support of tissue adhesion and vascularization , as well as minimizing the stress - shielding issues52829 .
however , exploring effective methods for the enhancement of osseointegration and more adequate ingrowth of mineralized bone tissue into the pore spaces of pti remains a major clinical concern , which is helpful for providing stable long - term anchorage for biological fixation of implants .
in the present study , wbv , as a kind of safe , affordable and non - invasive biophysical intervention , was used to determine its potential for improving the osteogenesis and osseointegration of pti implants .
firstly , our in vitro findings show that mechanical vibration significantly promoted osteoblastic activities and enhanced osteogenesis in pti .
secondly , the in vivo experiments demonstrate that wbv was able to stimulate osteogenesis and osseointegration , and enhance bone formation in pti implants .
moreover , we also reveal that wbv regulated peri - implant bone remodeling by mediating a series of molecular signaling associated with osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis , including bmp2 , wnt / lrp6 / beta - catenin , sost and opg / rankl / rank .
the present study demonstrates that wbv might become a potential biophysical modality for enhancing the repair efficiency and quality of pti in long bone defects .
cell adhesion onto biomaterials is considered to be the major prerequisites for osteoblasts exerting their biological functions30 , which involves a complex process with a series of chemical responses , including serum - protein adsorption , cell contact , attachment , and spreading3132 .
our in vitro results show that micromechanical vibration with 0.5 g , 30 hz promoted more osteoblasts adhered onto the pti substrate .
furthermore , the sem scanning results revealed stronger interlocking of cells into the titanium surface after mechanical vibration stimulation .
thus , the enhancement of cell adhesion by mechanical vibration played a critical role in the initiation of the activation of subsequent intracellular biochemical events .
the fitc fluorescence staining results further show that osteoblastic cytoskeleton exhibited more and thicker microfilaments with directional arrangement after the stimulation of mechanical vibration .
sato et al. have also reported the similar findings in vibration - induced cytomorphological changes of osteoblasts on titanium with smooth surface33 .
these changes in cellular structures are considered to be essential events for bone cells detecting and transducing the external mechanical signals , and thus regulating the biological behavior of bone cells ( e.g. , proliferation and differentiation ) 3435 .
the present study also reveals that mechanical vibration stimulated the proliferation and mineralization of primary osteoblasts inside the 3d pti disks via the mtt analysis and quantitative alizarin red - s staining .
several previous studies have also demonstrated that vibration loading with 30 hz significantly increased the cell density of in vitro osteoblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells on culture - grade polystyrene dishes3336 .
together , our findings suggest that mechanical vibration was able to promote cell adhesion , and thus regulate the subsequent biological functions of in vitro osteoblasts in 3d pti implants .
to explore the mechanism by which mechanical vibration regulated osteoblastic activities in pti , gene and protein expression of osteogenesis - associated molecules and signaling pathways was investigated .
our results show that the gene expression of alp , an indicator of osteoblast phenotype , was upregulated after mechanical vibration in pti , which keeps consistent with the previous findings on monolayer cells37 or cells seeded on flat titanium surface33 .
we also found that vibration loading enhanced the gene and protein expression of ocn , which is a major osteoblastic differentiation marker .
the similar findings were also revealed by tanaka et al. in monolayer mc3t3 - e1 cells37 .
mechanical vibration also resulted in the upregulation of gene and protein levels of runx2 , a key transcription factor involved in osteoblast differentiation38 .
the gene levels of bmp2 and opg , two key molecules responsible for promoting osteoblast differentiation and inhibiting osteoclast activities , respectively3940 , were elevated after mechanical vibration stimulation .
moreover , our study reveals the activation of canonical wnt signaling after the stimulation of mechanical vibration , as evidenced by increased gene and protein expression of wnt3a , lrp6 and beta - catenin .
our results keep consistent with previous findings , which demonstrate significant upregulation of wnt3a in bone cells under fluid shear stimulation4142 .
wnts are a family of secreted proteins existing extensively within the skeleton .
extracellular wnts can bind to the frizzled and lrp5 / 6 co - receptors on the cell membrane , and thus lead to the stabilization of beta - catenin in the cytoplasm .
substantial evidence has revealed that activation of canonical wnt signaling can promote osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast / osteocyte activity4344 .
numerous studies have also proved that lrp6 positively regulates osteoblastic activity and bone homeostasis , and mutant mice lacking lrp6 exhibited decreased bmd4546 .
it is shown that canonical wnt signaling is also able to activate alp , runx2 and bmp2 expression474849 .
thus , our findings indicate that canonical wnt signaling has been implicated in regulating in vitro osteoblastic activities in pti implants .
it has been reported that the optimal pore size of an ideal porous implant biomaterial for the repair of osseous defects should not be lower than 150 mum5051 .
the porosity should exceed 20 % , and a higher porosity is able to ensure more adequate in vivo tissue response to implantation552 .
the structural parameters of pti in the present study , including the porosity and pore size have been widely used in previous investigations both experimentally and clinically65253 .
our muct results exhibited notable enhancement of osteogenesis at the implant - bone interface as well as in the center of the porous implants after 6 - week and 12 - week wbv stimulation , as evidenced by increased bv / tv , tb.n , and decreased tb.sp and bs / bv. these findings were further confirmed by the histological analysis via masson - goldner trichrome staining .
thus , our findings demonstrate that wbv stimulation is able to result in faster and higher - quality osseointegration , which is beneficial for long - term stability and durability of implant fixation , as well as better overall mechanical performance of whole bone5455 .
unlike the vigorous weight - bearing activities ( e.g. aerobics and resistance exercises ) with more prominent bone stress , micromotion induced by wbv has the capacity of minimizing the discomfort and potential risk of implant movement or loosening .
moreover , dynamic histomorphometric analysis with double calcein labeling showed that wbv speeded up peri - implant bone mineral deposits and increased peri - implant bone formation rate .
these results keep in line with previous findings for the regulatory role of wbv in bone remodeling in normal and osteoporotic animals141756 .
thus , it is shown in the present study both histologically and ultrastructurally that wbv is able to promote osteogenesis and osseointegration of pti in the repair of long bone defect by regulating peri - implant bone remodeling .
then , we investigated the potential molecular signaling mechanisms of wbv on in vivo osteogenesis in pti implants .
in line with our in vitro findings , wbv resulted in prominent upregulation of alp , ocn , runx2 and bmp2 , revealing the promotive effects of wbv on osteoblastogenesis and mineralization in peri - implant bones .
furthermore , our results demonstrate that wbv enhanced gene expression in canonical wnt signaling , as evidenced by increased wnt3a , lrp6 and beta - catenin mrna levels .
thus , coupled with the in vivo histological and histomorphometric findings together with the in vitro results , the present study indicates that wbv promoted skeletal anabolic activities through a canonical wnt signaling - associated mechanism .
sclerostin , the product of the sost gene , is exclusively secreted by osteocytes which are regarded as the major mechanosensors in bone5758 .
sclerostin has proven to be an osteocyte - expressed negative regulator of bone formation , and decreased mechanical loads to bones resulted in significant increases of sclerostin5960 .
our results show that sost gene expression was significantly lower in the wbv - stimulated skeletons , which is consistent with the results of yadav et al. who found decreases of sost expression in the mouse molar after the wbv stimulation61 .
thus , wbv - induced reduction of sost expression is also able to facilitate the increase of bone formation rate in pti implants .
moreover , our results also show increased opg and decreased rankl gene expression .
it has been proved that the rankl / opg ratio is a major predictor of increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption4062 .
therefore , our results reveal the regulatory role of wbv in peri - implant bone remodeling with potent anabolic effects and potential anti - catabolic effects .
in conclusion , this study opens a new avenue for improving the repairing efficiency and quality of pti in bone defects in an easy and non - invasive manner .
we show that mechanical vibration promoted in vitro osteoblastic activities and osteogenesis through a mechanism associated with the activation of canonical wnt signaling .
our in vivo findings demonstrate that wbv promoted osteogenesis and osseointegration of pti via obvious anabolic actions in the repair of long bone defects .
our in vivo molecular signaling investigation further reveals that wbv activated osteoblastogenesis - associated canonical wnt signaling and also inhibited osteoclastogenesis - associated rankl / opg ratio .
thus , our findings suggest that pti implants accompanied by wbv stimulation exhibit high efficiency and quality in the repair of long bone defects , and might eventually become a clinically applicable treatment modality for osseous defects .

the interaction of two antitumor ruthenium ( iii ) complexes , - na [ trans - rucl4 ( dmso )( im )] and na [ trans - rucl4 ( dmso )( ind )] - with human serum apotransferrin ( apotf ) was investigated through a number of spectroscopic techniques such as uv - vis absorption , cd and 1h nmr spectroscopy .
interestingly , the hydrolysis profiles of these complexes in a physiological buffer are markedly affected by the presence , in solution , of apotf suggesting the occurrence of a specific interaction of their respective hydrolysis products with the protein .
the formation of stable adducts with apotransferrin has been demonstrated by cd spectroscopy , and additional information obtained through 1h nmr of the hyperfine shifted signals .
the bound ruthenium ( iii ) species may be detached from these adducts by addition of excess citrate at low ph. the behavior of the investigated ruthenium ( iii ) complexes with apotf is compared with that of the recently described and strictly related ru - im and ru - ind antitumour complexes , and discussed in the frame of general strategies of drug targeting .

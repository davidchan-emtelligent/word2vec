barriers to access and quality , such as long waits , disrespectful provider behavior , and medical barriers , continue to constrain health programs .
reducing them further requires a multipronged management approach that includes understanding and addressing provider behavior and the real problems providers face .
barriers to access and to the closely related issues of quality have been long recognized as important health program constraints.1 such barriers have been addressed by a number of initiatives , including by improving guidelines , standards , and norms , and by various quality improvement approaches .
two articles in this issue of ghsp - - tumlinson et al. for family planning and amin et al. for immunization - - examine this issue using a variety of methodologies including mystery clients .
unfortunately , important provider - generated barriers are still alive and well .
among the most prominent barriers : disrespect and verbal abuse lack of service - - for example , provider absences , service not provided that day medical barriers - - such as requiring women to be menstruating in order to obtain a family planning method and not providing immunizations if a child has an illness inadequate counseling inappropriate fees ( tumlinson only ) the first of these - - disrespect and abuse - - has recently emerged as a major concern in the maternal health area.2 rudeness and abuse take on a particularly poignant role in that arena , because women in labor and at delivery are vulnerable and , in a sense , captive .
notably , amin et al. found that previous provider rudeness in maternity care appeared to spill over to discourage caregivers from seeking immunization for their children .
on the positive side , much of what providers are doing appears to demonstrate reasonably good access and quality .
so what will it take to reduce the important barriers that persist ?
there is , of course , no single answer .
but it does require awareness of the problem and serious approaches to remedy it , including : training , supervision , management , further technical policy change , better supply chain , job aids , and engaging the consumer community to demand consistent and respectful service .
however , we also need to empathize with providers and get a better grasp of their perspective .
amin et al. give some insight on the provider prospective , including heavy workloads , lack of staff , requirement to provide multiple services ( multitasking ) , and lack of transport .
these should come as no surprise .
we know many such problems are common in health systems .
improving them , and improving access and quality , has no single solution but requires good systems and management thinking to address the problems .
the worst thing we can do is pretend they do not exist .

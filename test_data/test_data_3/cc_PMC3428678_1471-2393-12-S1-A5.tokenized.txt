placental examination is a non - invasive means , by which much information can be gained about adverse pregnancy outcomes , including stillbirth .
complete gross and histologic examination of the placenta can both point out and exclude multiple potential causes for stillbirth .
" cord accident ," defined by obstruction of fetal blood flow through the umbilical cord , is a common ante - or perinatal occurrence .
obstruction can be either acute , as in cases of cord prolapse during delivery , or subacute - to - chronic , as in cases of grossly abnormal umbilical cords ( e.g. long cord , hypertwisting , cord with true knots , entangled cord , velamentous cord , etc ) .
in the past , this diagnosis has relied on clinical history and has otherwise been one of exclusion for the pathologist , when , following a complete autopsy and placental examination , no other cause of death is found .
since as many as 20 % of normal livebirths are associated with a nuchal cord , clinical history by itself is not reliable for diagnosis of this entity .
over the past few years , we have studied the placenta in setting of cord accident , and have established histologic criteria for its diagnosis , which can identify this entity with high specificity [ 1,2 ] .
our initial study identified cord accident - related changes in large fetal vessels in the placenta [ 1 ] .
these changes are all likely related to obstruction - induced vascular stasis , leading to dilated and thrombosed fetal vessels , most commonly found in the chorionic plate and large stem villous vessels [ 1,2 ] .
these " minimal " criteria have a sensitivity of 62 % and specificity of 79 % [ 2 ] .
the additional finding of fetal thrombotic vasculopathy ( ftv ) in sections of placental disc increases the specificity to 94 % , albeit lowering the sensitivity ( 46 %) [ 2 ] .
ftv is defined by the diminuition of fetal vessels in terminal chorionic villi , leading early on to " villous stromal karyorrhexis ," with fragmented red cells and cellular debris over the receding fetal vessels , and later on , by " avascular villi ," characterized by fibrotic stroma and complete avascularity [ 3 ] .
originally suspected to be a marker for fetal and / or maternal thrombophilia , more recent studies have found it to be most commonly associated with grossly abnormal umbilical cords , which predispose to cord compression and compromise fetal blood flow [ 3 ] .
our own previous studies have shown that ftv is commonly seen in cases with gross abnormalities of the umbilical cord [ 4 ] as well as associated with fetal growth restriction , congenital heart abnormalities , and stillbirth , particularly those associated with umbilical blood flow compromise [ 5 ] .
a few considerations regarding application of these criteria warrant mention here .
first , these changes are characteristic of intermittent interruption of umbilical cord blood flow , and are therefore not useful in cases of acute cord accident ( e.g. cord prolapse ) [ 1 ] .
second , post - mortem changes in the chorionic villi can resemble changes of ftv , particularly when the placenta is retained over 48 hours following stillbirth [ 6 ] .
in these settings , it is important to remember that ftv is a temporally heterogeneous lesion , while post - mortem change is uniform throughout the entire placental disc ; therefore , the two are distinguishable in a careful histologic examination of the placenta [ 1,2,6 ] .
finally , due to the temporal heterogeneity of ftv , and the fact that focal ftv cannot be identified grossly , a more thorough sampling of the placental disc is warranted in the setting of stillbirth , particularly if cord accident is suspected .
we routinely submit 4 , instead of the usual 2 , sections of the placental disc in the setting of stillbirth .

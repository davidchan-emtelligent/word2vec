the developing lens is a powerful system for investigating the molecular basis of inductive tissue interactions and for studying cataract , the leading cause of blindness .
the formation of tightly controlled cell - cell adhesions and cell - matrix junctions between lens epithelial ( le ) cells , between lens fiber ( lf ) cells , and between these two cell populations enables the vertebrate lens to adopt a highly ordered structure and acquire optical transparency .
adhesion molecules are thought to maintain this ordered structure , but little is known about their identity or interactions .
cysteine - rich motor neuron 1 ( crim1 ) , a type i transmembrane protein , is strongly expressed in the developing lens and its mutation causes ocular disease in both mice and humans .
how crim1 regulates lens morphogenesis is not understood .
we identified a novel enu - induced hypomorphic allele of crim1 , crim1glcr11 , which in the homozygous state causes cataract and microphthalmia .
using this and two other mutant alleles , crim1null and crim1cko , we show that the lens defects in crim1 mouse mutants originate from defective le cell polarity , proliferation and cell adhesion .
crim1 adhesive function is likely to be required for interactions both between le cells and between le and lf cells .
we show that crim1 acts in le cells , where it colocalizes with and regulates the levels of active beta1 integrin and of phosphorylated fak and erk .
the rgd and transmembrane motifs of crim1 are required for regulating fak phosphorylation .
these results identify an important function for crim1 in the regulation of integrin - and fak - mediated le cell adhesion during lens development .
summary : crim1 , a type i transmembrane protein , acts in lens epithelial cells where it colocalizes with and regulates the levels of active beta1 integrin to control cell adhesion during mouse lens morphogenesis .
key words cataract cell adhesion cysteine - rich transmembrane bmp regulator 1 crim1 eye development integrin lens mouse introduction the developing lens is a powerful system for the study of tissue interactions and also the target of the medically important ocular disease cataract , a lens opacity that affects over 25 million individuals and is the leading cause of blindness worldwide ( asbell et al. , 2005 ; hejtmancik , 2008 ) .
the mature lens consists of two polarized cell types : a monolayer of lens epithelial ( le ) cells and a mass of elongated and aligned lens fiber ( lf ) cells .
the entire structure is covered by a lens capsule , a thick basement membrane secreted by le and early lf cells in a polarized manner ( wederell and de longh , 2006 ) .
during development , the lens originates from a thickening of the head ectoderm that invaginates to form the lens pit , and then detaches to form the lens vesicle .
cells from the anterior lens vesicle differentiate into epithelial cells , while cells from the posterior lens vesicle elongate to form primary fiber cells .
in later embryogenesis , le cells continuously proliferate and differentiate into secondary fiber cells at the lens equator ( lovicu and mcavoy , 2005 ; mcavoy et al. , 1999 ) .
many cellular processes , including cell adhesion , actin dynamics , proliferation , differentiation and migration are important for lens transparency .
the study of cell adhesion molecules reveals that contacts between le and le cells , le cells and matrix , and between le and lf cells are crucial for lens survival and for the maintenance of the le cell phenotype ( pontoriero et al. , 2009 ; wederell and de longh , 2006 ) .
however , details of the molecular mechanisms involved are not well understood .
members of the integrin family are implicated in the cell adhesion processes that occur in the developing lens .
integrins are the major cell adhesion transmembrane proteins that connect cells to the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) ( hynes , 1992 ) .
in mouse , there are 18 alpha and 8 beta subunits that can form 24 different integrin heterodimers , each capable of preferentially binding a set of ecm substrates .
upon binding , integrins activate signaling pathways to transduce signals from outside the cell to inside , or vice versa , to regulate many cellular processes , including cell adhesion , proliferation , migration and differentiation .
beta1 integrin forms the largest integrin subfamily as it can assemble into heterodimers with 12 different alpha subunits .
studies of lens development have shown that beta1 integrin is expressed in le cells and lf cells ( bassnett et al. , 1999 ; menko and philip , 1995 ; wederell et al. , 2005 ) , whereas beta3 and beta4 integrins are also expressed in developing lens , together with alphav and alpha6 , respectively [ reviewed by walker and menko ( 2009 )] .
although knockout of the mouse beta1 integrin gene ( itgb1 ) leads to peri - implantation lethality ( fassler and meyer , 1995 ; stephens et al. , 1995 ) , conditional knockout of itgb1 in lens results in cataract and microphthalmia due to apoptosis of le cells and loss of the le cell phenotype ( samuelsson et al. , 2007 ; simirskii et al. , 2007 ) .
immunofluorescence analysis of the itgb1 null lens shows that the epithelium becomes disorganized and begins to express the mesenchyme marker alpha - smooth muscle actin ( simirskii et al. , 2007 ) .
thus , integrin signaling can affect adhesion , actin dynamics and proliferation processes known to be important for lens morphogenesis , but understanding how other molecules integrate with or regulate integrin signaling in lens development remains incomplete .
genetic mouse mutants can provide significant new and unbiased insight into the molecular mechanisms of lens development. from a forward n - ethyl - n - nitrosourea ( enu ) mutagenesis screen , we scored novel mouse cataract phenotypes and identified a mutation that creates a cryptic splice acceptor within an intron to produce a hypomorphic allele of crim1 , crim1glcr11 .
crim1 is a type i transmembrane protein , with an n - terminal insulin - like growth factor - binding protein motif ( igfbp ) and six cysteine - rich von willebrand factor c ( vwc ) repeats located in the extracellular domain ( kolle et al. , 2000 ) .
the six vwc repeats of crim1 resemble those of extracellular proteins such as collagens vi , vii , xii and xiv , and of chordin , a bmp antagonist ( colombatti et al. , 1993 ) .
crim1 mrna is spatially and temporally regulated in various tissues and cell types , including the neural tube ( kolle et al. , 2000 ) , vascular system ( fan et al. , 2014 ; glienke et al. , 2002 ) , urogenital tract ( georgas et al. , 2000 ) , ear and eye ( lovicu et al. , 2000 ; pennisi et al. , 2007 ) .
mouse crim1 mutants display perinatal lethality with defects in limbs , kidney , vascular system and eye , and analysis of a crim1 null mutant suggests a role in maintaining retinal vascular and renal microvascular stability through vegfa signaling ( fan et al. , 2014 ; wilkinson et al. , 2007 , 2009 ) .
studies in xenopus embryos show that the cytoplasmic domain of crim1 can complex with n - cadherin and beta - catenin and regulate adhesion complex stability in neural ectoderm ( ponferrada et al. , 2012 ) .
biochemical analysis of crim1 has shown that it can act as a bmp antagonist by binding with bmps and so inhibit their maturation and secretion ( wilkinson et al. , 2003 ) .
crim1 localizes to different subcellular compartments , including the endoplasmic reticulum , membrane compartments upon stimulation , and the secretory compartment ( glienke et al. , 2002 ) .
the distinct localization of crim1 and its unique structural motifs suggest that crim1 executes multiple roles in development .
recently , crim1 haploinsufficiency was implicated in the human ocular syndrome macom ( omim # 602499 ) , which is characterized by iris coloboma , microcornea , and increased axial length associated with myopia ( beleggia et al. , 2015 ) .
here we show that mice homozygous for any one of three crim1 loss - of - function mutations also exhibit striking defects in lens and ocular development .
using these three alleles , we demonstrate that crim1 is required during lens development for the acquisition of le cell polarity , for le cell proliferation , and for appropriate cell - cell adhesive interactions required for organized lens development .
we further show that crim1 can bind to beta1 integrin and that it regulates integrin , fak and erk signaling both in mouse lens tissue and in cultured cells .
these results identify a novel role for crim1 in the regulation of integrin and integrin - related downstream signaling during lens morphogenesis .
results identification of an intronic mutation in the crim1glcr11 mouse mutant in a forward enu screen we identified a recessive mouse mutant that exhibited cataract ( fig. 1a , arrow ) .
this mutant , designated glcr11 ( glaucoma relevant 11 ) was mapped to an 8 mb region on mouse chromosome 17 using strain - specific polymorphisms and meiotic recombination mapping ( fig. s1a ) .
whole - genome sequencing ( wgs ) identified eight homozygous variants within a larger 26 mb region ( fig. s1a ) , with four variants in deep intergenic regions and four in introns. of the genes that contained intronic variants , crim1 had the highest embryonic lens - specific expression according to the isyte gene expression database ( lachke et al. , 2012 ) .
furthermore , the crim1 variant , a homozygous g - - > a transition in intron 13 , created a consensus splice acceptor motif ( dogan et al. , 2007 ) that could constitute a cryptic splice acceptor ( fig. 1b ) .
rt - pcr followed by dna sequence analysis confirmed that this variant creates a functional cryptic splice acceptor site within intron 13 that truncates the crim1 open reading frame shortly after exon 13 via a stop codon in intron 13 and appends a short nonsense peptide ( fig. 1b,c ) .
this variant is therefore a functional mutation , as verified by the size of the truncated crim1 protein detected in crim1glcr11 mice by western blot ( fig. 1d ) .
to formally prove that the crim1 mutation is responsible for the glcr11 phenotype , we obtained an existing crim1 null allele , crim1null , and performed a classical complementation test with crim1glcr11 .
the two alleles failed to complement , and crim1glcr11 / null transheterozygotes displayed cataracts and other lens defects similar to those seen in homozygotes for each of the two alleles ( fig. s1b ) .
thus , crim1 loss - of - function causes the lens phenotype in crim1glcr11 mutants. fig. 1. wgs identifies an intronic mutation in crim1glcr11 mouse cataract mutants .

in the crim1glcr11 mutant , crim1 is truncated via a stop codon shortly after exon 13 , and hence the full - length 124 kda form is absent .
the truncated crim1glcr11 protein is almost the same size (~ 100 kda ) as the naturally occurring proteolytic form .

we next examined crim1 protein expression during mouse lens development .
crim1 expression is developmentally regulated , with expression beginning at e10.5 throughout the entire lens and then becoming concentrated in le cells at e12.5 ( fig. 2a - e ). by comparison , crim1 expression in lf cells is minimal , as revealed by immunofluorescence ( if ) and by western blot analysis ( fig. 2a - g ) , suggesting that crim1 plays a crucial role in le cells .
when we stained crim1null lenses using anti - crim1 antibody , no if signal was detected in le cells ( fig. 2d ') .
in wild - type mice , crim1 localizes to the cell membranes and intracellular membranes of le cells. by contrast , although residual intracellular expression persists , the membrane localization of crim1 in crim1glcr11 mutant le cells is severely reduced , and staining for the epithelial adhesion junction marker e - cadherin showed disorganized le cell - cell adhesions ( fig. 2f , arrow ) .
the reduction in crim1 levels in le cells was confirmed by western blot , which showed a marked reduction in the full - length 124 kda crim1 .
notably , crim1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage just proximal to the transmembrane domain to generate an extracellular 100 kda isoform ( wilkinson et al. , 2003 ) .
the crim1glcr11 splicing mutation occurs between the vwc5 and vwc6 domains and truncates crim1 prior to its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains .
this markedly reduces the level of the 124 kda isoform and generates a truncated mutant extracellular - domain - only form of crim1 that migrates close in size to the naturally occurring 100 kda crim1 isoform generated by proteolytic cleavage ( fig. 2g ). fig. 2. crim1 is localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm of le cells .

( g ) western blot showing that crim1 is mainly detected in le cells .
images shown are representative of four independent experiments .
crim1glcr11 mutants develop cataract and microphthalmia within 8 weeks of birth , all crim1glcr11 mutants develop a posterior lens cataract and retinal dysplasia , and ~ 19 % of mutants exhibit microphthalmia ( fig. 3a,b , fig. s2a,b ) .
at later stages , the le and lf cell compartments develop vacuoles that are frequently associated with lens capsular rupture and extrusion of the lf into either the anterior chamber or the vitreous ( fig. 3c - f ) .
these gross structural defects can be detected as early as postnatal day ( p ) 6 .
in wild - type lenses , le cells show an orderly alignment ( fig. 3g ') , whereas in mutant lenses the le cells develop vacuoles and exhibit a disrupted cellular architecture ( fig. 3h ') .
the lenses in mutant mice are also smaller , with an altered shape and fewer le cells per section ( 152 +/ - 6 cells ) compared with those of wild - type controls ( 250 +/ - 9 cells ; fig. 3g - j ) .
in summary , crim1glcr11 mutants develop multiple lens defects , suggesting that crim1 mediates multiple cellular events during lens development. fig. 3. capsular rupture and le - le and le - lf cell defects in crim1glcr11 mutants .

images shown are representative of four independent experiments .
crim1glcr11 mutants exhibit defective le - lf cell adhesion , and le cell polarity and proliferation cell adhesion , polarity , proliferation and apoptosis are important processes in lens development , and their perturbation can contribute to cataract formation .
we first examined adhesion junctions by staining for n - cadherin and beta - catenin in p21 lenses .
in wild - type lenses , the adhesion junctions mainly reside at the cell - cell borders of le cells , le - lf junctions ( fig. 4a , arrows ) , and along the short ends of hexagonal lf cells ( fig. 4a , arrowheads ). by contrast , the localization of n - cadherin and beta - catenin in the anterior region of mutant lenses is severely disorganized ( fig. 4b , arrows , fig. s3a ) .
in particular , le - lf adhesion is disrupted in crim1glcr11 mutants ( fig. 4b , arrows ) , leading to the detachment of lf from le cells ( fig. 4j ) .
altered cell adhesion is commonly coupled with defective apical - basal polarity .
we therefore examined the expression of zo - 1 ( tjp1 - mouse genome informatics ) , a tight junction marker , which revealed a loss of this polarity marker in le cells ( fig. 4d - f , arrows , fig. s3b,c ) .
the decrease in zo - 1 expression is more severe in le cells , suggesting that the lf cell phenotype might be secondary to detachment from le cells. fig. 4. crim1glcr11 defects in lens cell adhesion , polarity and proliferation .

western blot shows that beta - catenin levels are unchanged ( c ) , whereas zo - 1 levels are significantly decreased in le cells but not in lf cells ( f ) .

crim1glcr11 mutants also develop smaller lenses with fewer le cells ( fig. 3j ) .
this phenotype could result from decreased proliferation or increased apoptosis .
whereas tunel assay and staining for active caspase 3 showed no difference between wild - type and mutant lenses ( fig. 4i ; data not shown ) , examination of proliferating le cells by immunofluorescent detection of phospho - histone h3 or ki67 revealed decreased proliferation in mutant lenses ( fig. 4g,h ) .
to determine whether crim1 is required for early lens development , we examined lens morphology at various developmental stages .
crim1glcr11 mice start to exhibit disorganized le cells as early as e16.5 , and quantification of total le cell number and phospho - histone h3 + cells showed a significant decrease in le cells and in proliferating le cells in e16.5 mutant lenses ( fig. 5a,c,d ) .
thus , crim1 is required for normal le cell adhesion , polarity and proliferation. fig. 5. crim1glcr11 and crim1cko mice exhibit lens development defects .

crim1 is also important for the normal development of other tissues , such as the vascular system surrounding the lens and retina ( fan et al. , 2014 ) .
to exclude the possibility that the lens defects are secondary to other ocular abnormalities , we obtained a crim1 conditional knockout ( crim1flox ) allele ( fan et al. , 2014 ) and crossed it with le - cre , which provides lens - specific cre expression ( ashery - padan et al. , 2000 ) .
similar to crim1glcr11 and crim1null , crim1flox / flox ; le - cre mouse mutants ( henceforth referred to as crim1cko ) developed small eyes with altered lens morphology , but with earlier onset than crim1glcr11 mutants , beginning at e12.5 ( fig. 5b ) .
thus , both crim1cko and crim1null mutants exhibit lens defects that resemble , but occur earlier than , those in crim1glcr11 mutants .
apart from those affecting the eye , crim1glcr11 mutants did not exhibit other discernible defects , suggesting that the developing eye is highly sensitive to crim1 loss - of - function .
these data further suggest that crim1glcr11 is a hypomorphic allele , and that the full - length transmembrane form of crim1 is required for normal lens development .
crim1 colocalizes with beta1 integrin in le cell membranes in xenopus neuroepithelial cells , the crim1 c - terminal cytoplasmic domain stabilizes the interaction between n - cadherin and beta - catenin ( ponferrada et al. , 2012 ) .
however , in crim1glcr11 mutants , beta - catenin colocalizes properly with n - cadherin , and beta - catenin protein levels remain unchanged ( fig. 4b,c , fig. s3a ) .
this suggests that crim1 acts through a different mechanism to regulate cell adhesion in lens tissue .
although crim1 in cell lines plays a role in sequestering bmp and may act as a bmp antagonist ( wilkinson et al. , 2003 ) , we found that phospho - smad 1 / 5 / 8 , a downstream readout of bmp signaling , is unchanged in le and lf cells in crim1glcr11 mutants ( fig. s4a,b ) .
moreover , crim1null mice do not exhibit defects in lens induction or in early body axis patterning ( data not shown ) , which are known bmp - dependent processes .
the morphology of crim1glcr11 mutant le cells is reminiscent of the disorganized lens epithelium associated with pathological epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in other mouse cataract mutants ( lovicu et al. , 2002 ) .
pathological lens emt is associated with increased expression of mesenchymal alpha - smooth muscle actin , increased deposition of the ecm proteins collagen iv and fibronectin , and decreased expression of epithelial e - cadherin ( walker and menko , 2009 ) .
however , we observed no change in e - cadherin , collagen iv or alpha - smooth muscle actin expression in crim1 mutants , effectively excluding the hypothesis that crim1 regulates emt during lens development ( fig. s5 ) .
furthermore , in crim1glcr11 mutants neither le cells nor lf cells showed alterations in phospho - smad2 levels , a readout of tgfbeta signaling and a recognized emt modulator ( lovicu et al. , 2002 ) .
therefore , neither crim1 loss - of - function nor the truncated crim1glcr11 protein causes pathological lens emt .
a conditional null mutation of itgb1 in the mouse lens shows defects in le cell adhesion and loss of le integrity that partly resemble those in the crim1 mutant lens ( samuelsson et al. , 2007 ; simirskii et al. , 2007 ) .
because beta1 integrin is expressed in le cell membranes and in lf cells ( bassnett et al. , 1999 ; samuelsson et al. , 2007 ; simirskii et al. , 2007 ) , we hypothesized that crim1 might interact with beta1 integrin , directly or indirectly , to regulate cell - cell adhesion in the developing lens .
indeed , we found that crim1 bears an extracellular arg - gly - asp ( rgd ) sequence , which is a well - known integrin - binding motif .
immunostaining of crim1 and beta1 integrin showed strong endogenous coexpression at the basal surface and cell - cell border of le cells ( fig. 6a , arrows ) .
using co - immunoprecipitation , we also found that crim1 can physically interact with beta1 integrin ( fig. 6b ) .
immunostaining with an antibody against active beta1 integrin showed significantly reduced levels in the crim1glcr11 and crim1null lens equatorial zone ( fig. 6c,d ). fig. 6. crim1 regulates integrin and fak and erk phosphorylation in lens development .

to test whether itgb1 and crim1 function within the same genetic pathway in vivo , we performed a genetic interaction experiment by crossing p0 - 3.9 - gfpcre ; crim1flox / flox and itgb1flox / flox .
at e18.5 , one compound heterozygous p0 - 3.9 - gfpcre ; crim1flox /+ ; itgb1flox /+ mouse out of four displayed iris coloboma similar to that seen in human crim1 haploinsufficiency ( fig. 6g ) .
the phenotype became more severe as six out of six p21 compound heterozygotes exhibited bilateral cataract ( fig. 6g , arrowhead ) , compared with none of four littermate controls .
immunostaining of compound heterozygote lenses showed le cell detachment from lf cells , similar to that seen in crim1 mutants .
this genetic interaction is consistent with the idea that crim1 interacts with the beta1 integrin signaling pathway , and that it partly regulates lens morphogenesis by this mechanism .
crim1 regulates fak and erk phosphorylation an early event in integrin activation is the phosphorylation of fak ( ptk2 ) , which drives the actin cytoskeletal reorganization required for cell spreading , migration and polarity .
subsequent events can include activation of erk and akt , which regulate cell proliferation and survival , respectively ( legate et al. , 2009 ) .
western blot analyses of crim1glcr11 and crim1null lenses showed statistically significant decreases in phospho - fak ( pfak ) to 56 +/ - 10 % and 34 +/ - 6 % of wild - type levels and in phospho - erk ( perk ) to 37 +/ - 13 % and 14 +/ - 7 % of wild - type levels , respectively ( fig. 6e ; see legend for p - values ) .
we also examined whether reductions in crim1 regulated akt phosphorylation .
however , no significant change in phospho - akt ( pakt ) was observed ( fig. 6e ) .
lastly , to confirm that crim1 regulates integrin signaling , we performed crim1 knockdowns in 21em15 le cells ( terrell et al. , 2015 ) .
when endogenous crim1 was knocked down to < 10 % of wild - type levels by either of two sirnas , pfak and perk , but not pakt , were downregulated in a statistically significant fashion to ~ 50 % and ~ 35 % of control levels , respectively ( fig. 6f ) .
crim1 thus appears to play a role in regulating the phosphorylation status of fak and erk , and hence fak and erk signaling in lens morphogenesis .
membrane - bound crim1 is crucial to activate beta1 integrin signaling to determine the subcellular localization of crim1 , we prepared an ha - tagged crim1 construct and transfected it into 21em15 cells .
ha - tagged crim1 colocalized at the tips of lamellipodia and filopodia with beta1 integrin ( fig. 7a ' , a '') .
next , to determine which crim1 domains are required for fak and erk phosphorylation , we examined fak and erk activity in 21em15 cells that overexpressed one of four constructs : ( 1 ) full - length crim1 ( crim1 - fl ) ; ( 2 ) crim1 without the intracellular domain ( crim1 - deltaid ) ; ( 3 ) crim1 with only the extracellular domain ( crim1 - ed ) ; or ( 4 ) crim1 with a g315r mutation in its rgd motif ( crim1 - rrd ). fig. 7. crim1 colocalizes with integrin and activates the integrin - fak - erk signaling pathway .

arrows point to active integrin staining .
( c ) expression constructs representing myc - tagged full - length crim1 ( fl ) , crim1 extracellular domain only ( ed ) , crim1 lacking the intracellular domain ( deltaid ) , and crim1 carrying rgd in place of rrd ( crim1 - rrd ) were transfected into hek 293t cells for 48 h and then western blotted with the indicated antibodies .
pfaky397 and perk are induced by fl and deltaid , whereas rrd induces perk but not pfaky397 .
ctrl is vector only .
images shown are representative of three independent experiments .
scale bars : 10 mum .
cells overexpressing ha - tagged crim1 - fl showed an increase in active beta1 integrin activity compared with cells overexpressing crim1 - ed or crim1 - rrd ( fig. 7b , arrows ) .
similarly , overexpression of crim1 - fl or crim1 - deltaid effectively induced fak and erk phosphorylation , whereas crim1 - ed overexpression failed to activate fak or erk ( fig. 7c ) .
these results indicate that membrane - bound crim1 , but not the cytoplasmic tail , is required for fak phosphorylation .
notably , overexpression of the crim1 - rrd mutant also failed to upregulate pfak , but it did upregulate perk , indicating that the crim1 rgd motif is required for fak phosphorylation and for discriminating between these two signaling pathways .
together with results from the knockdown and in vivo experiments , these data demonstrate that crim1 can regulate integrin activity and fak and erk signaling in lens development .
discussion roles for crim1 in lens development we identified an enu - induced mouse mutation that truncates the crim1 protein prior to its transmembrane domain , thus creating a novel allele , crim1glcr11 , with which to study crim1 function .
the crim1glcr11 allele is deficient for full - length membrane - bound crim1 , but expresses a truncated extracellular form that resembles a normal crim1 proteolytic product .
several lines of evidence suggest that the truncated form expressed by the mutant , and by inference the crim1 proteolysis product that it resembles , might not have a major role in lens morphogenesis .
first , in a complementation test , the crim1glcr11 allele behaves as a classic hypomorphic loss - of - function allele .
second , unlike full - length crim1 , crim1 - ed overexpression is unable to activate fak or erk , suggesting that the truncated extracellular form encoded by the crim1glcr11 allele would also lack this function .
lastly , the proteolytic product only represents a small fraction of the total crim1 gene product in the wild - type lens , as revealed by western blot .
using the hypomorphic crim1glcr11 allele , along with the existing crim1null and crim1cko alleles , we uncovered a novel function for crim1 in regulating le cell behavior in vivo and a mechanistic link between crim1 and beta1 integrin - dependent regulation of lens morphogenesis .
recently , crim1 haploinsufficiency has been linked to human macom syndrome , an ocular disease characterized by microcornea , iris coloboma and increased axial length with severe myopia ( beleggia et al. , 2015 ) .
affected individuals in this family carry a 22 kb heterozygous deletion that encompasses terminal exons 14 - 17 of crim1 as well as most of the 3 ' - utr of an adjacent gene , fez2 .
the human macom phenotype might reflect the effect of crim1 loss - of - function or , since fez2 is expressed in mouse e11.5 and e12.5 lens according to the ocular lens gene discovery tool isyte ( lachke et al. , 2012 ) and potentially in other ocular tissues , the combined effects of crim1 and fez2 loss - of - function .
the latter scenario could explain why the macom phenotype involves macrophthalmia without cataracts , whereas all three mouse crim1 loss - of - function models exhibit microphthalmia and congenital cataracts .
alternatively , the difference in the mouse and human phenotypes might reflect differences in ocular development , in modifying alleles , or in crim1 expression in the two species .
yet another explanation for the discrepancy in phenotypes is simply that heterozygosity for human crim1 does not cause sufficient loss - of - function to produce a cataract phenotype .
although the role of crim1 in human ocular pathology remains open , our work provides definitive in vivo evidence that crim1 is required in lens development to maintain le cell polarity , adhesion and proliferation .
the membrane localization of crim1 protein is essential for these events , as loss of crim1 membrane localization impairs le cell shape and cell adhesion .
indeed , crim1 specifically localizes to the leading edge of cell protrusions , where actin cytoskeleton remodeling is highly active during the acquisition of polarity by le cells .
a link between crim1 and beta1 integrin signaling in lens development several lines of evidence suggest that crim1 function during lens development involves the regulation of beta1 integrin signaling .
first , crim1 and beta1 integrin are coexpressed in le cells and at le - le cell interfaces , and the level of activated beta1 integrin in le cells depends upon crim1 function .
crim1 and beta1 integrin also possess the potential to physically interact with each other , as shown by co - immunoprecipitation .
in addition , in cells transfected with crim1 , crim1 and beta1 integrin colocalize to the tips of lamellipodia and filopodia .
thus , crim1 and beta1 integrin appear to reside in close physical proximity in le cells .
since the interaction of integrins expressed at the le cell basal surface with ecm components of the lens capsule basement membrane is well supported ( wederell and de longh , 2006 ) , the interaction between integrins and crim1 at the lateral surfaces of le cells could provide a similar mechanism for cell adhesion between le cells .
a second line of evidence that supports an interaction between crim1 and beta1 integrin signaling is that crim1 function , and specifically that of membrane - bound , rgd - containing crim1 , is required for the phosphorylation of fak , a key proximal mediator of integrin signaling .
the effect of mutation in the crim1 rgd motif in abrogating fak phosphorylation supports this mechanism .
the specific localization of crim1 to le cell membranes , coupled with the role of crim1 in the regulation of integrin signaling , could provide a mechanism to restrict the activation of integrin in le cells .
a last line of evidence that crim1 function intersects with integrin signaling is genetic .
the lens phenotypes associated with itgb1 and with integrin - linked kinase ( ilk ) mutants bear some similarity to the crim1 mutant lens phenotype .
in a conditional itgb1 knockout , le cells exhibit vacuolization with increased apoptosis , while mice deficient for ilk exhibit le cell disorganization , decreased le cell numbers , decreased cell polarity with disturbed zo - 1 expression , and decreased perk activity in le cells ( cammas et al. , 2012 ) .
these phenotypic similarities could be consistent with a role for crim1 in modulating beta1 integrin signaling during lens development .
to test this hypothesis genetically , we intercrossed the crim1null and itgb1flox alleles , the latter conditionally inactivated via p0 - 3.9 - gfpcre , and examined the resulting compound heterozygotes for evidence of synthetic phenotypic enhancement .
interestingly , crim1null and itgb1flox compound heterozygotes displayed iris coloboma and cataract , confirming that crim1 and itgb1 genetically interact .
in summary , crim1 appears to function as an adhesion protein , is highly enriched in developing lens , and its perturbation in mouse causes cataract with altered le cell adhesion , polarity and proliferation .
in addition , crim1 appears to influence the integrin signaling that is crucial for lens development .
crim1 deficiency disturbs this regulation and leads to cataract .
interestingly , crim1 is also expressed in the developing kidney , and crim1 deficiency leads to a dilated and disorganized renal capillary network ( wilkinson et al. , 2007 ) .
this phenotype resembles that in itga3 ; itgb1 knockout mice ( kreidberg et al. , 1996 ) , suggesting that crim1 might regulate integrin signaling in other developing organs in addition to the eye .
it will be interesting to investigate whether the function of crim1 uncovered here is also deployed in other tissues during development .
materials and methods mouse strains crim1glcr11 mice were identified as part of a phenotype - driven screen to detect mutagenized mice with glaucoma - relevant and cataractous phenotypes .
the crim1glcr11 mutation was induced with n - ethyl - n - nitrosourea ( enu ) on a c57bl / 6j genetic background and outcrossed to c3a.blia - pde6b +/ j for more than three generations .

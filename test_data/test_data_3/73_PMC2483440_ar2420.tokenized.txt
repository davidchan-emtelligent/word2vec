introduction the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies ( anti - ccp ) in patients with primary sjogren syndrome ( pss ) and its correlation with clinical and laboratory data .
methods we analysed the clinical and serological data of 155 consecutive patients with pss .
among these , 14 were excluded due to fulfillment of american college of rheumatology criteria for rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) .
so , 141 patients ( 27 males and 114 females ; mean age 48 years , range 39 to 60 ) were clinically assessed for the presence of synovitis ( objective swelling of one or more joints ) and extra - glandular involvement .
the anti - ccp antibodies were tested using a commercially available second - generation enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay .
igm rheumatoid factor ( rf ) was determined by nephelometry .
results fourteen patients ( 9.9 %) had moderate to high levels of anti - ccp , and 94 ( 66.7 %) were positive for rf. eighty - one ( 57.4 %) showed extra - glandular involvement , and 44 ( 31.2 %) had synovitis without any radiographic sign of erosion .
there was a close correlation between the presence of anti - ccp and synovitis ( p < 0.001 ) but no association between anti - ccp and extra - glandular involvement ( p = 0.77 ) .
multivariate analysis confirmed the association between anti - ccp and an increased prevalence of synovitis ( prevalence odds ratio for positive versus negative anti - ccp status 7.611 , 95 % confidence interval 1.475 to 74.870 ; p = 0.010 ) .
conclusion only a minority of patients with pss are anti - ccp - positive , which seems to be closely associated with the prevalence of synovitis .
anti - ccp positivity in patients with pss therefore may be a predictor of future progress to ra or an expression of the inflammatory process of synovial tissue .
introduction primary sjogren syndrome ( pss ) is a chronic , slowly progressive , inflammatory , autoimmune disease that is characterised by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands ( which reduces or eliminates glandular secretion ) and marked b - lymphocytic cell hyper - reactivity , which initially is manifested by a variety of serum autoantibodies , including those against ro ( ssa ) and la ( ssb ) , and rheumatoid factor ( rf ) [ 1 - 4 ] .
most patients with pss present only with keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia , but approximately 40 % develop extra - glandular musculoskeletal manifestations ; lung , kidney , and skin involvement ; vasculitis ; neuropathy ; and lymphoma [ 1,2 ] .
the most common are arthralgia and an intermittent non - erosive polyarthropathy affecting mainly the small joints , which means that the picture may mimic that of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , particularly as 50 % to 80 % of cases are rf - positive [ 4,5 ] .
however , the fact that tests for cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies ( anti - ccp ) usually are negative may help to differentiate the two conditions .
anti - ccp antibodies , which were first described in 1998 , were found to be highly specific in the diagnosis of ra ( 95 %) and only slightly less sensitive than igm rf ( 60 % to 70 %) [ 6,7 ] , whereas the second generation of anti - ccp antibodies have a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 98 % .
follow - up studies of patients with early ra have demonstrated that anti - ccp antibodies independently predict the development of erosions [ 8,9 ] , but goeb and colleagues [ 10 ] found anti - ccp autoantibodies in only 4 % of 137 women and 16 % of 11 men with pss .
gottenberg and colleagues [ 11 ] studied a cohort of 134 patients with pss and found that 7.5 % of the serum samples were positive for anti - ccp antibodies and 5.2 % were positive for anti - keratin antibodies ( akas ) without any radiographic evidence of erosion after a long follow - up. they suggested that the anti - ccp - positive patients , who may be prone to developing ra , require cautious clinical and radiographic follow - up. the aims of this study were to verify the prevalence of anti - ccp antibodies in patients with pss and to investigate any associations with their clinical and laboratory characteristics .
materials and methods patients the study involved 155 consecutive ss patients who were evaluated at three tertiary rheumatologic referral centres and who fulfilled the american - european consensus group diagnostic criteria [ 12 ] .
fourteen patients with ss fulfilling the american college of rheumatology ( acr ) criteria for ra and / or presenting at least one joint erosion [ 13 ] were excluded ; 141 patients ( 114 women and 27 men ; mean age 48 years , range 39 to 60 ; mean disease duration 0.98 +/ - 6.12 years ) were considered for the present study .
acr criteria were considered to be fulfilled if at least four criteria were present simultaneously for at least 6 weeks .
all of the study subjects had their medical history recorded and underwent a clinical assessment , including ' synovitis' ( defined as objective swelling of one or more joints in the absence of erosions ) and extra - glandular involvement , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) , c - reactive protein , rf , and anti - ccp , anti - extractable nuclear antigen ( ena ) , and antinuclear antibodies ( anas ) .
hand and foot radiographs were also evaluated .
written informed consent was obtained from the patients before their inclusion in the study , which was approved by the ethics committees of the participating centres .
all of the patients with synovitis and anti - ccp antibodies were re - evaluated by an experienced rheumatologist to definitively exclude a diagnosis of ra according to acr criteria .
to be classified as having ra , patients had to have met four criteria simultaneously for at least 6 weeks by the time of the evaluation or in the past .
detection of anti - cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies anti - ccp antibodies were tested using a commercially available second - generation enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) kit ( axis - shield , dundee , uk ) as previously described [ 14 ] .
the serum samples were evaluated in triplicate , with the upper normal limit of 5 iu / ml being assumed in accordance with the manufacturer 's recommendations .
plates from the same batch (# 470094 ) were used in order to avoid any plate - to - plate variations in anti - ccp measurements .
inter - and intra - assay variability was less than 9 % .
detection of rheumatoid factor igm rf was measured by means of immunonephelometry using the quantitative n latex rf system ( dade behring , now part of siemens ag , munich , germany ) .
concentrations of greater than 15 iu / ml were considered positive .
detection of antinuclear and anti - extractable nuclear antigen antibodies anas were tested by means of standard indirect immunofluorescence , as previously described [ 14 ] , using a bx 51 olympus fluorescence microscope ( olympus optical co. , hamburg , germany ) at x40 power .
ena antibodies were evaluated in triplicate using commercially available elisa kits ( axis - shield ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
the following individual ena specificities were investigated : sm , rnp , ssa ( ro ) , ssb ( la ) , scl - 70 , and jo1 .
radiographic assessment radiographs of the hands and feet were evaluated at the time of the anti - ccp analysis .
patients with at least one erosion were excluded from the study .
statistical analysis the data were statistically analysed by means of r software , version 2.5 [ 15 ] , using the wilcoxon non - parametric rank sum test for continuous variables , and the fisher exact or pearson chi - square test with yates' continuity correction for discrete variables .
all of the analyses were two - tailed .
p values of less than 0.05 were considered as indicating statistical significance .
the variables found to be significantly associated with the prevalence of anti - ccp positivity at the univariate level were examined in a logistic regression model using exact inference ( logxact version 7 ; cytel inc. , cambridge , ma , usa ) .
the prevalence odds ratio ( or ) was used as the effect measure in this prevalence study [ 16 ] .
results fourteen ( 9.9 %) of the patients with pss had moderate to high levels of anti - ccp antibody , and 94 ( 66.7 %) were rf - positive , 134 ( 95 %) ana - positive , 115 ( 81.6 %) ssa - positive , and 55 ( 39 %) ssb - positive ( table 1 ) .
the mean value for anti - ccp antibodies was 46 iu / ml ( 28 to 78 ) , with a normal range ( as defined by the manufacturer ) of less than 5 iu / ml. none of the 14 patients fulfilled the acr criteria for ra. the focus score at lip biopsy was greater than 1 in 94 patients ( 67.1 %) .
extra - glandular involvement was found in 81 patients ( 57.4 %) ( table 2 ) , and synovitis was found in 44 ( 31.2 %) without any radiographic evidence of erosions ( table 1 ) .

anti - ccp - positive primary sjogren syndrome patients there was a close relationship between anti - ccp positivity and synovitis ( p < 0.001 ) but not between anti - ccp positivity and other extra - glandular involvement ( p = 0.77 ) .

multivariable analysis of synovitis an exact logistic regression analysis was used to model the effects of the presence of positive anti - ccp antibodies on the prevalence of synovitis , adjusting for the potential covariates of age , disease duration , gender , and anti - ssa and anti - ssb antibodies .
age and disease duration were divided into quartiles with the aim of simplifying the interpretation of the results by comparing the oldest patients and those with the longest disease duration .
anti - ssa and anti - ssb antibodies were included in the model because they were found in 60 % of the patients and are associated with more frequent extra - glandular manifestations [ 4,17 ] .
as shown in table 4 , multivariate analysis of the anti - ccp - positive patients , adjusted for age , gender , disease duration , and anti - ssa and anti - ssb antibodies , confirmed the association with an increased prevalence of synovitis ( prevalence or versus anti - ccp - negative patients = 7.611 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 1.475 to 74.870 ; p = 0.010 ) .
none of the covariables included in the model was statistically significant except for anti - ssb antibodies , which were of borderline significance ( prevalence or versus anti - ssb - negative patients = 0.393 , 95 % ci 0.130 to 0.967 ; p = 0.084 ) .
diagnostic procedures did not reveal any violations of the model assumptions , and the test of the deviance did not provide any evidence requiring the rejection of the null hypothesis of goodness - of - fit ( p > 0.23 ) .

discussion musculoskeletal manifestations such as fatigue , myalgia , arthralgia , an intermittent non - erosive polyarthropathy affecting mainly the small joints , and usually mild synovitis are common in patients with pss and may mimic ra , particularly in the presence of rf [ 2,3,18 ] , although the fact that tests for anti - ccp antibodies usually are negative may help to differentiate the two conditions [ 19,20 ] .
we found slightly high anti - ccp levels in 14 of our 141 patients with pss ( 9.9 %) .
some studies have found that anti - ccp antibodies are an independent factor predicting the development of erosions in patients with ra [ 8,9 ] , but none of our 44 pss patients with synovitis ( 31.2 %) showed any radiographic sign of erosions .
after a long follow - up , gottenberg and colleagues [ 11 ] found that 80 out of 134 pss patients with no radiographic evidence of erosions ( 59 %) were positive for igm rf , 10 ( 7.5 %) for anti - ccp , 7 ( 5.2 %) for aka , and 5 ( 3.7 %) for both anti - ccp and aka .
we also found no significant differences between our anti - ccp - positive and - negative patients in terms of demographic factors or extra - glandular manifestations .
however , the presence of synovitis in pss patients did seem to be closely associated with the presence of anti - ccp antibodies as the odds of having synovitis were 1.475 times greater in our anti - ccp - positive patients , regardless of the other covariables in the model .
there were no other significant associations with clinical or laboratory parameters between the anti - ccp - positive and - negative patients .
in addition , anti - ssb positivity was weakly and inversely associated with the prevalence of synovitis .
antibodies to the ro / ssa and la / ssb ribonucleoprotein particles usually are found in the serum of pss patients and are associated with a longer disease duration , more frequent non - exocrine manifestations , and more intense lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands [ 21 ] .
the prevalence of anti - ssb is higher in pss , but in our patient cohort it was also inversely related to the presence of synovitis .
the possibility that our anti - ccp patients represent a subgroup of patients with ra and secondary ss was ruled out by excluding patients fulfilling acr criteria at the beginning of the study and re - evaluating all of the anti - ccp - positive patients .
in our study , we decided to be very stringent in the application of acr criteria , and we classify as ra those patients in whom clinical symptoms ( symmetrical arthritis , arthritis of the hands , more than three groups of joints involved , and morning stiffness ) were simultaneously present at the moment of evaluation or for at least 6 weeks in the past .
in fact , even if we had considered the possibility of a diagnosis of ra for symptoms that were successive and not simultaneously present , none of the 14 patients would have been classifiable as having ra ( data not shown ) .
indeed , the possibility that patients with anti - ccp antibodies may develop ra cannot be ruled out by the present study , and it is possible that in the future anti - ccp will be interpreted as an additional marker of definite ra. it should be noted , however , that anti - ccp antibodies are strictly associated with the development of erosions in ra and that none of our patients developed erosions after a mean follow - up of 2.4 years .
as a matter of fact , anti - ccp antibodies may also be observed in a minority of patients with other systemic autoimmune diseases .
takasaki and colleagues [ 22 ] detected anti - ccp antibodies in patients with mixed connective tissue disease ( mctd ) ( 9 %) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( 14 %) , systemic sclerosis ( 13 %) , polymyositis / dermatomyositis ( 14 %) , and ss ( 18 %) .
some of these patients presented overlapping ra and connective tissue diseases ( particularly mctd ) and so , as in the case of other autoimmune diseases , anti - ccp positivity in pss may be a marker of synovial tissue inflammation .
the results of our study suggest that the production of anti - ccp antibodies may be less related to the pathogenesis of ra. it is possible that marked b - lymphocyte hyper - reactivity ( a characteristic of pss ) may explain the presence of anti - ccp antibodies , as usually is observed in the case of rf and anti - ssa and anti - ssb antibodies [ 23 ] .
conclusion only a minority of patients with pss are anti - ccp - positive , but the prevalence of synovitis seems to be closely associated with the presence of anti - ccp antibodies as multivariate analysis confirmed the association between anti - ccp positivity and an increased prevalence of synovitis .
however , the possibility that patients with anti - ccp antibodies may develop ra cannot be ruled out , particularly in patients with the concomitant presence of igm rf. abbreviations acr = american college of rheumatology ; aka = anti - keratin antibody ; ana = antinuclear antibody ; anti - ccp = cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody ; ci = confidence interval ; elisa = enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ; ena = anti - extractable nuclear antigen ; esr = erythrocyte sedimentation rate ; mctd = mixed connective tissue disease ; or = odds ratio ; pss = primary sjogren syndrome ; ra = rheumatoid arthritis ; rf = rheumatoid factor ; ss = sjogren syndrome .

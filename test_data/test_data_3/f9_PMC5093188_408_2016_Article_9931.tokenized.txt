introduction fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms in copd , but little is known about the impact of fatigue on functional disability .
we explored the impact of fatigue and fatigue intensity on exercise tolerance after adjusting for other factors using multivariate analysis and compared it to that of dyspnoea .
methods a total of 119 patients with mainly moderate - severe stable copd ( 38 % women , mean age 66 years ) were enrolled .
we used the medical research council dyspnoea scores ( mrc ) , manchester copd fatigue scale ( mcfs ) and its three dimensions , borg scales for fatigue and dyspnoea , six - minute walk distance ( 6mwd ) , st george 's respiratory questionnaire , the bode index , and the centre for epidemiological study on depression scale ( ces - d ) , and we measured spirometry , blood gases , systemic inflammatory markers and fat - free mass index ( ffmi ) .
results fatigue measured using the mcfs was associated with 6mwd and explained 22 % of the variability in 6mwd ( p < 0.001 ) .
fatigue remained associated with 6mwd after adjusting for mrc dyspnoea , ffmi and fev1 , fvc , pao2 , paco2 , ces - d , tnf - alpha , smoking status , age and gender .
we found that 33 , 50 and 23 % of patients reported an increase by 2 scores on borg scales for fatigue , dyspnoea or both at the end of the 6mwt .
fatigue scores ( both before and after the 6mwt ) were negatively correlated with 6mwd after adjusting for fev1 , ffmi , ces - d score and age ( p = 0.007 and 0.001 , respectively ) .
conclusion in moderate stable copd , fatigue may be a central driver of functional disability , to the same extent as dyspnoea .

issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media new york 2016 introduction copd is a disabling and often a progressive disease [ 1 ] .
poor exercise performance is a major manifestation of copd , which is associated with limited functional capacity [ 2 ] , impaired health status [ 3 ] , depression [ 4 - 6 ] , poor prognosis and high risk of mortality [ 7 - 9 ] .
a limited number of studies have assessed the correlation of fatigue with functional capacity [ 10 ] , and little is known about the association of fatigue with exercise intolerance using an objective measure such as the self - paced six - minute walking test ( 6mwt ) .
several other factors such as dyspnoea [ 5 , 11 ] , muscle mass depletion [ 12 ] , age , gender [ 11 ] , systemic inflammation [ 13 , 14 ] and global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease ( gold ) stages and emphysema [ 5 ] have been associated with poor performance in the 6mwt .
an increase in dyspnoea is more prominent than fatigue after incremental [ 15 , 16 ] and endurance shuttle walking tests [ 15 ] , while fatigue is more frequently reported after cycling test [ 15 , 17 ] .
however , the impact of fatigue compared to dyspnoea on the performance of clinically stable copd patients in the 6mwt has not been adequately studied .
clinically , regular physical activities have been associated with reduced hospital admission and mortality [ 18 ] , and several studies have shown that fatigue is one of the strongest factors associated with reduced physical activity and a major component of impaired health status [ 19 - 22 ] .
furthermore , assessment of dyspnoea severity alone may be inadequate in investigating patients suitability for pulmonary rehabilitation [ 23 ] .
for these reasons , fatigue assessment may need more attention in daily clinical practice and could constitute a reasonable target for therapeutic intervention , particularly as it has been shown to improve after pulmonary rehabilitation [ 24 , 25 ] and walking exercise [ 26 ] .
the two main aims of this study were as follows : ( 1 ) to explore the impact of fatigue on exercise tolerance after adjusting for other factors and ( 2 ) to compare the association between fatigue intensity and walking distance in a 6mwt to that of dyspnoea intensity .
we hypothesized that fatigue would impact on the 6mwd similar to dyspnoea .
methods study subjects we assessed 200 patients with copd , and 119 patients with clinically stable copd were enrolled in the study .
we excluded patients with a recent exacerbation or rescheduled their visits to ensure at least 4 weeks of clinical stability before the visit date .
we also excluded patients with symptomatic ischaemic heart disease , congestive heart disease , lung cancer , known psychiatric illness and maintenance treatment with systemic corticosteroids [ 4 ] .
all participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study , and the south manchester research ethics committee had approved the study ( reference number 05 / q1402 / 41 ) .
assessments fatigue was assessed at enrolment using the manchester copd fatigue scale ( mcfs ) [ 22 , 27 ] .
it measures total fatigue as well as dimensional assessment of physical , cognitive and psychosocial fatigue .
the total score ranges from 0 to 54 ; the higher the score , the worser the fatigue .
additionally , dyspnoea was assessed using the medical research council dyspnoea scale [ 28 ] .
self - paced exercise capacity was measured using the 6mwt according to the ats guideline [ 11 ] , a cut - point for 6mwd of 350 m was chosen on the basis of the bode index [ 29 ] and its ability to identify poor exercise performance [ 30 ] .
depressive symptoms were assessed using the centre for epidemiological study on depression ( ces - d ) scale [ 31 ] .
we used the bioelectrical impedance analysis to measure body composition ( bodystat ltd. , douglas , uk ) .
fat - free mass index ( ffmi ) was calculated as fat - free mass divided by height squared .
for defining muscle wasting , we used the dutch criteria : ffmi < 16 kg / m2 for men and ffmi < 15 kg / m2 for women [ 32 ] .
we also assessed the intensity of fatigue and dyspnoea before and after a 6mwt using the borg scale [ 33 ] , where patients rated their perception of fatigue and dyspnoea on a scale ranging from 0 to 12 , with 0 meaning no fatigue / dyspnoea and 12 meaning extreme fatigue / dyspnoea intensity [ 15 ] , and it has been suggested that a change of 2 units would indicate a minimal clinically important difference in perceived dyspnoea [ 34 , 35 ] .
health status was measured using the st george 's respiratory questionnaire ( sgrq ) [ 3 ] .
the multidimensional bode index was also used [ 29 ] .
spirometry was done according to the ats / ers standardisation guideline [ 36 ] using a jaeger masterscreen spirometer ( jaeger ltd. , hoechberg , germany ) .
earlobe capillary blood gases were measured according to the method described by spiro and dowdeswell [ 37 ] using a radiometer analyzer ( radiometer medical a / s , copenhagen , denmark ) .
pulse rate and oxygen saturation ( nonin oximetry , plymouth , usa ) were also measured before and after 6mwt .
we also measured systemic plasma tnf - alpha and its receptors tnf - alpha r1 and r2 , and serum il - 6 using high sensitivity elisa ( quantikine , r & d systems , europe , oxon , uk ) .
plasma crp was measured by high sensitivity particle - enhanced immunonephelometry ( cardiophase ; bn systems , dade behring , newark , nj , usa ) .
statistical analysis with a sample of 119 patients , the study had 80 % power to detect correlation of 0.25 or more between various variables .
normal distribution was assessed by kolmogorov - smirnov goodness of fit test , and non - parametric data were natural log transformed or presented as median and interquartile range ( iqr ) .
the univariate correlation of fatigue ( total and dimensional mcfs scores ) as well as the intensity of dyspnoea and fatigue scores ( borg scale ) with the 6mwd was assessed using the pearson and spearman correlation , respectively .
the association of walking distance (< 350 vs. >= 350 m ) with airflow obstruction , health status , oxygen saturation , arterial capillary blood gases , body mass and fat - free mass was examined using the independent sample t - tests .
the mann - whitney test was used to investigate the association of walking distance (< 350 vs. >= 350 m ) with the median values of bode , ces - d , pack - years and fatigue and dyspnoea scores in borg scale .
the difference in the median of fatigue and dyspnoea scores ( borg scale ) , and the mean of heart rate and o2 saturation before and after 6mwt were examined using the wilcoxon test and paired t - test , respectively .
the independent sample t - test was used to examine the difference in airflow obstruction , muscle mass , health status and exercise capacity between patients who experience more fatigue , dyspnoea or both by >= 2 scores ( in borg scale ) at the end of the 6mwt ; similarly , the mann - whitney test was used to examine the difference in the median of bode and ces - d scores .
the chi - square ( chi2 ) test was used to examine the categorical association of worsening fatigue , dyspnoea or both ( after 6mwt ) with copd severity ( bode quartiles ) , airflow obstruction ( gold stages ) , exercise capacity limitation (< 350 vs. >= 350 m ) , muscle wasting and depressive symptoms ( using the 16 score cut - off for ces - d scores ) .
finally , multivariate linear analyses were used to examine the association of all factors with exercise capacity .
spss version 20 ( spss inc , usa ) was used .
results we studied 119 patients with mainly moderate - severe copd with an average age of 66 years , of which 38 % were women .
as shown in table 1 , approximately half of the cohort walked less than 350 m in the 6mwt ; women made up 49 % of this subgroup .
these patients had worse lung function , poorer health status , more pack - years and they had relatively more dyspnoea and fatigue than those who walked >= 350 m at baseline .
they also reported significantly more dyspnoea and fatigue after the 6mwt .

total mcfs scores had the highest negative correlation with exercise capacity ( r = - 0.47 , p < 0.0001 ) , and it explained 22 % of the variance of exercise tolerance .
we found that tnf - alpha only had a negative correlation with 6mwd ( rho = - 0.2 , p = 0.047 ) , and crp trended to correlate with 6mwd ( rho = - 0.18 , p = 0.065 ) .
in a fully adjusted model including mrc dyspnoea scale , ffmi , fvc , so2 , ces - d and fev1 % , the model explained 38 % ; this model was the best at explaining the variation in exercise tolerance ( see table 1 in the e - supplement ) .
univariate analysis showed that fatigue and dyspnoea scores measured with the borg scale had similar negative correlations with 6mwd , before ( rho = - 0.35 and - 0.26 ; p = < 0.0001 and 0.006 , respectively ) as well as after the 6mwt ( rho = - 0.4 and - 0.031 ; p = < 0.0001 and < 0.001 , respectively ) .
both dyspnoea and fatigue intensity scores were significantly higher after the test as shown in table 2 .

we found that 33 , 50 and 23 % of our samples reported an increase by 2 or more scores for fatigue , dyspnoea or both after the 6mwt .
these patients had comparably poorer 6mwd , more severe copd ( fev1 % or bode scores ) , more depression and worse quality of life , as illustrated in fig. 1 and table 3. fig. 1 the association of worsening in fatigue and dyspnoea ( after 6mwt ) and health status table 3 the relationship of worsening in fatigue and dyspnoea or both ( post - 6mwt ) to copd measurements worsening fatigue by < 2 scores worsening fatigue by >= 2 scores [ n = 37 , ( 32 %)] p worsening dyspnoea by < 2 scores worsening dyspnoea by >= 2 scores [ n = 57 ( 49 %)] p worsening dyspnoea and fatigue by < 2 scores worsening dyspnoea and fatigue by >= 2 scores [ n = 27 ( 23 %)] p bode [ median ( iqr )] 2 ( 1 - 3 ) 4 ( 2 - 5 ) < 0.001 2 ( 1 - 3 ) 3 ( 1 - 5 ) 0.04 2 ( 1 - 4 ) 4 ( 2 - 5 ) 0.013 fev1 % [ mean ( sd )] 54.7 ( 17.7 ) 46.7 ( 19.4 ) 0.03 55.5 ( 17.3 ) 48.5 ( 19.2 ) 0.04 53.2 ( 17.7 ) 48.6 ( 21 ) 0.3 muscle mass ( ffmi ) 17.8 ( 3.2 ) 18.1 ( 3.7 ) 0.64 17.5 ( 3 ) 18.5 ( 3.7 ) 0.12 17.9 ( 3.2 ) 18.3 ( 3.9 ) 0.6 total sgrq [ mean ( sd )] 40 ( 20.6 ) 59 ( 15 ) < 0.001 40.0 ( 20.5 ) 52.2 ( 19.7 ) 0.004 42.6 ( 20.6 ) 59.8 ( 15.4 ) < 0.001 ces - d [ median ( iqr )] 8 ( 3 - 14 ) 13 ( 9 - 18 ) 0.004 7.5 ( 2 - 13.5 ) 12 ( 6 - 18 ) 0.004 8 ( 2 - 14 ) 14 ( 11 - 20 ) < 0.001 6mwd [ mean ( sd )] 361.7 ( 69 ) 316 ( 72.4 ) 0.002 354.5 ( 70.3 ) 340.7 ( 75 ) 0.3 354.5 ( 71 ) 324.1 ( 15.6 ) 0.07 bode : multidimensional index ( b body mass index , o obstruction of airways as measured by fev1 , d dyspnoea as measured by mrc scale , e exercise capacity as measured by 6mwt ) ; ces - d centre for epidemiologic studies depression scale , fev 1 % forced expiratory volume over 1 s of predicted , ffmi fat - free mass index , 6mwd 6 minute walk distance , m metre , iqr interquartile range , sgrq george 's respiratory questionnaire moreover , categorical analysis showed that patients who experienced more fatigue and dyspnoea intensity after 6mwt had more severe illness , more depression or more impaired self - paced exercise performance as shown in table 4 .

moreover , fatigue scores remained associated with 6mwd after adjusting for fev1 % , ffmi , ces - d score and age , beta = - 0.25 ( p = 0.007 ) before the 6mwt and - 0.30 ( p = 0.001 ) after .
discussion we have reported two novel findings .
first , fatigue had a significant burden on self - paced exercise capacity and contributed significantly to explaining the variance of limited exercise capacity .
these findings were consistently seen in univariate analysis and in multivariate analysis modules after adjusted for several confounding factors .
second , using univariate and multivariate analyses , the impact of fatigue intensity on exercise performance ( before and after the 6mwt ) was at least comparable to the impact of dyspnoea intensity .
fatigue impact seems a central driver of disability as it alone explained 22 % of the variance of limited exercise capacity .
this association remained statistically significant after adjusting for several confounding factors such as dyspnoea [ 11 ] , muscle mass depletion [ 12 ] , depressive symptoms [ 4 ] , lung function deterioration , age , gender [ 11 ] and markers of systemic inflammation [ 13 , 14 ] , where tnf - alpha only remained statistically significant in multivariate analyses ( table s1 ) .
the best multivariate module explained 38 % of limited exercise performance .
in fact , our finding suggests that there are factors , other than fatigue and the variables we have included , that affect exercise performance and functional capacity such as muscle weakness [ 38 ] , left cardiac dysfunction [ 39 ] and degree of emphysema [ 5 ] .
univariate and multivariate analyses showed that fatigue had at least comparable impact on the self - paced exercise capacity as dyspnoea .
fatigue is a complex phenomenon , and its impact on exercise capacity in copd can be due to the poor quality of sleep [ 40 ] , metabolic skeletal muscle stress [ 41 ] , lack of energy and depressive symptoms [ 27 ] , the impact of the labour of breathing [ 42 ] , linkage with exacerbation frequency [ 43 ] and severity [ 44 ] , lack of regular physical activity [ 25 ] , muscle depletion and dysfunction [ 45 ] , and possibly systemic inflammation [ 46 ] .
the choice of exercise test is important for understanding the results as dyspnoea has previously been shown to be more prominent after the iswt [ 15 , 16 ] and the eswt [ 15 ] , whereas fatigue was more prominent after a cycling test [ 15 , 17 ] .
the 6mwt is a robust and simple test that is widely used with the advantage that patients familiarly walk at their own pace [ 11 ] .
therefore , the test likely reflects the daily functional capacity [ 2 ] and the whole body functional performance [ 11 ] .
additionally , the test has been widely validated , and a poor performance in the test has frequently shown a significant association with deteriorated quality of life [ 11 ] , low mood [ 4 ] , depleted muscle mass [ 12 ] , poor prognosis [ 30 ] and mortality [ 8 ] .
our findings suggest that an improvement in fatigue after medical intervention such as pulmonary rehabilitation would result in a significant improvement in quality of life .
indeed , fatigue seems to improve after pulmonary rehabilitation [ 24 , 25 ] .
however , the scales used in assessing the response of fatigue to pulmonary rehabilitation are general scales , and fatigue is a complex phenomenon that needs further investigation in larger studies with disease - specific robust scales , e.g. , the manchester copd fatigue scale [ 27 ] .
second , the finding of this study supports the idea that dyspnoea severity alone ( usually grade 3 - 5 ) is likely inadequate to assess the suitability of patients for pulmonary rehabilitation [ 47 ] .
indeed , patients would achieve a considerable benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation regardless of their mrc dyspnoea grade [ 23 ] .
therefore , other factors such as fatigue , depression and possibly muscle wasting should be considered in assessing the suitability of patients for pulmonary rehabilitation , particularly since these factors often affect the motivation of the patients to complete pulmonary rehabilitation program [ 48 ] .
in conclusion , using two validated tools in measuring fatigue impact and intensity in copd , this study quantified the substantial effect of fatigue on self - paced exercise capacity .
in comparison to a similar dyspnoea worsening , fatigue worsening after 6mwt was significantly associated with poor exercise performance in moderate - severe stable copd .
this finding highlights a need for assessing fatigue in more depth in future copd studies .

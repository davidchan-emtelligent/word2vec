background the cyp2e1 and gstm1 genes encode metabolic enzymes that have key functions in drug modification and elimination .
methodology / principal findings we investigated the possible effects of cyp2e1 and gstm1 polymorphisms in 71 leprosy patients and in 110 individuals from the general population .
the gstm1 * 0 null allele and indel cyp2e1 * 1d mutant genotypes were analyzed by conventional pcr , while cyp2e1 snps ( 1053c > t , 1293g > c and 7632t > a ) were determined by rt - pcr .
in leprosy patients , the gstm1 * 0 and cyp2e1 * 5 alleles and the combined alleles gstm1 * 0 / cyp2e1 * 6 and gstm1 * 0 / cyp2e1 * 5 were significantly related to a baciloscopic index ( bi ) ( bi < 3 ) , while the cyp2e1 * 6 allele was related to a better clinical evolution in the leprosy spectrum .
conclusions / significance therefore , gstm1 * 0 , cyp2e1 * 5 and cyp2e1 * 6 may be possible protection factors for leprosy patients .

introduction leprosy is an insidious infectious disease caused by the obligate intracellular bacteria mycobacterium leprae that affects the skin and peripheral nerves , causing a chronic granulomatous infection [ 1 ] .
multidrug therapy ( mdt ) , the treatment recommended by the world health organization ( who ) , has healed millions of patients since it was implemented in 1980s .
mdt consists of the use of dapsone and rifampicin for 6 months in paucibacilary ( pb ) patients , or both along with a third drug , clofazimine , for 12 months in multibacilary ( mb ) cases [ 2 ] .
patients are classified as pb or mb using a simple system introduced by the who in 1982 .
patients with 5 skin lesions or less are classified as pb , and those with more than 5 lesions are classified as mb [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
although this simple classification scheme is adequate for remote sites where the population has little or no access to health care , it is not detailed enough for more in - depth research surveys .
another way to classify leprosy patients is based on a skin smear test , for which a positive result is classified as mb , and a negative result as pb. a trained laboratory technician can readily identify afb ( acid fast bacillus ) , making this test a very reliable method .
however , cases initially classified as pb ( afb negative ) can evolve to mb in the natural course of the disease [ 5 ] .
this phenomenon is especially true for those patients classified as indeterminate ( mhi ) using the madrid classification system .
the use of the ridley - jopling clinical , histological and immunological criteria further improves case definitions , with tt ( tuberculoid - tuberculoid ) patients exhibiting a strong cellular immune response ( cir ) and a negative skin smear test , while ll ( lepromatous - lepromatous ) patients have a weak or absent cir and a highly positive skin smear [ 6 ] .
in the middle of the spectrum are a large number of borderline patients , varying from weak to strong cir and from negative to positive skin smears .
interestingly , neither the cir status nor the skin smear test is predictive of leprosy reactions or of the progression of each case through the physical disabilities caused by the disease .
to date , little is known about which factors are crucial to the development of these disabilities .
all types of patients , tt , borderline or ll , can progress with highly incapacitating disabilities and chronic neuropathies with no single marker or criteria to predict patient outcome [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
dapsone ( 4,4 ' - diaminodiphenyl sulfone , dds ) is one of the primary drugs used in anti - leprosy therapeutics .
it is a bacteriostatic agent that competes with para - aminobenzoic acid ( paba ) , diminishing or blocking the production of bacterial folic acid [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] .
clofazimine is a riminophenazine dye that has bactericidal and anti - inflammatory effects .
it inhibits bacterial proliferation by binding to bacterial dna and blocking its replication [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
rifampicin , or rifampin ( rif ) has a well - proven bactericidal effect on m. leprae .
it is a semisynthetic drug , originally derived from streptomyces mediterranei , and it is widely used for treating leprosy and tuberculosis .
rif prevents protein production by inhibition of rna polymerase in bacterial cells [ 10 ] - [ 16 ] .
cyp - 450 members of the heme protein superfamily are notable for their large spectrum of action and the distribution of their biological structures .
these proteins participate in critical processes including the biosynthesis of steroidal hormones and the detoxification by conjugation with cellular components , such as glutathione [ 17 ] .
cyp2e1 is found in various tissues including brain , lungs and kidneys , but it is most concentrated in the liver , where the majority of biotransformation occurs .
four main snps in the cyp2e1 gene have been investigated in different populations , including tuberculosis ( tb ) patients [ 18 ] - [ 20 ] , who often show 1053c > t and 1293g > c mutations , which together form the compound allele cyp2e1 * 1a , cg ; cyp2e1 * 5 , tc. another snp , 7632t > a , is located in the sixth intron of the cyp2e1 gene and has two alleles , wild - type cyp2e1 * 1a ( t ) and mutant cyp2e1 * 6 ( a ) .
additionally , a 96 - bp indel polymorphism with two alleles , wild - type cyp2e1 * 1c ( del ) and mutant cyp2e1 * 1d ( ins ) , has also been described [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
there are different glutathione s - transferase ( gst ) isoforms , including gstm1 , which is located on chromosome 1 .
more than 51 snps have been described within gstm1 , among which are two functional alleles , gstm1 * a and gstm1 * b , that have the same detoxification efficacy ; one null ( deletion ) allele , gstm1 * 0 ; and one duplication [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
two gstm1 polymorphisms , gstm1 * 1 , which has normal activity , and gstm1 * 0 , which has no enzymatic activity because it is a complete gene deletion , have been well studied in different populations [ 23 ] - [ 25 ] .
the presence of the null allele seems to be related to substrate conjugation and excretion ; therefore , its presence can be an indicator for more rational drug dosages for various groups of patients [ 26 ] .
we investigated a sample of mdt - treated leprosy patients ascertained at the dr. marcello candia reference unit in the sanitary dermatology of the state of para ( uremc ) with the aim of identifying associations among cyp2e1 polymorphisms [ including 1053 c > t , 1293g > c ( cyp2e1 * 1a , cyp2e1 * 5 ) ; 7632t > a ( cyp2e1 * 1a , cyp2e1 * 6 ) ; 96 - bp indel cyp2e1 * 1c ( del ) and cyp2e1 * 1d ( ins )] and gstm1 polymorphisms ( gstm1 * 1 and gstm1 * 0 ) and possible protection factors for leprosy patients .
methods sample we investigated 71 leprosy patients who attended the dr. marcello candia reference unit in the sanitary dermatology of the state of para ( uremc ) in marituba , para , brazil , from january 2008 to december 2009 .
in uremc there are about 40,000 yearly consultations on different medicine specialties as , among others , leprology , dermatology , ophthalmology and orthopedics , besides nursery , physical therapy and other health professionals sessions .
since 2002 , uremc registered between 308 and 472 leprosy patients ( mean : 408 cases / year ) .
during years 2008 and 2009 , 765 leprosy cases were registered , from those , 71 ( 9,28 %) were randomly selected for this study .
all patients were evaluated neurologically by semmes - weinstein monofilament examination ( swme ) for sensory testing , and by voluntary motor testing ( vmt ) for function assessment of muscular force , as previously described [ 27 ] .
they were classified according to the ridley - jopling system and were distributed in two groups depending on the progression of the disease : the positive (+) group consisted of pb patients skin smear negative tuberculoid ( tt ) patients and mb skin smear negative borderline - tuberculoid ( bt ) patients , with or without leprosy reactions , with no sequel ( defined by sensorial loss or motor deficit on hands or feet on nerve function impairment ( nfi ) assessment ) , and the negative ( - ) group consisted of pb patients with or without leprosy reactions , but with sequel , together with all mb skin smear positive borderline - borderline ( bb ) , borderline - lepromatous ( bl ) and lepromatous - lepromatous ( ll ) patients , regardless reactions or sequel .
additionally , in order to make other comparisons , patients were classified according to the baciloscopic index ( bi ) , a group with a low (< 3 ) bi ( lbi ) , and a group with high (>= 3 ) bi ( hbi ) [ 28 ] .
a sample of 110 healthy individuals from the same geographic area were included in the study as controls .
all patients were informed about the study before signing informed consent forms .
the project was approved by the para federal university ethics committee ( ndegrees 197 / 07 ) .
dna extraction dna extraction was performed as previously described [ 29 ] .
the dna concentration was determined by spectrophotometry ( themo scientific nanodrop 1000 , nanodrop technologies , wilmington , us ) .
cyp2e1 genotyping three cyp2e1 polymorphisms , 1053c > t , 1293g > c and 7632t > a , were investigated using a taqman genotyping assay and analyzed by real time pcr 7500 ( life technologies , ca , usa ) .
the indel was investigated using conventional pcr methods , followed by visualization on an agarose gel .
specific pcr programs were established according to the annealing temperatures of the primers , and the amplifications were performed on a thermocycler veriti 96 well thermal cycler ( life technologies , ca , usa ) .
the alleles of the four cyp2e1 polymorphisms investigated were defined using the official nomenclature , as described in http :// www.cypalleles.ki.se / cyp2e1.htm .
gstm1 genotyping for amplification , a set of primers for gstm1f / gstm1r was investigated using conventional pcr methods ( thermocyclerveriti 96 well thermal cycler - life technologies , ca , us ) , followed by visualization on an agarose gel .
ancestry informative markers ( aim ) individual interethnic admixture was estimated using a panel of 48 ancestry informative markers ( aims ) , as previously described [ 30 ] .
statistical analyses estimations of linkage disequilibrium ( d and d ') and haplotypes and allelic frequencies were estimated with the m. locus v .
2.0 software [ 31 ] .
all other statistical analyses were performed using spss v .
12.0 ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) , and results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 .
results demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in table 1 .
age , gender , sequel and clinical forms were all statistically significant when lbi and hbi were compared .
sequel occurred in 76.9 % of the hbi patients whereas in the lbi group only 37.5 % of the patients presented sequel .

there were 19 patients classified in the positive (+) group , of which nine were designated pb ( two with reaction ) and 10 were mb ( four with reaction and all without sequel ) , while 52 patients comprised the negative ( - ) group , two of which were pb ( all with reaction and sequel ) , and 50 were mb ( 35 with reaction and 40 with sequel ) ( table 2 ) .
concerning genotypic and allelic distribution of snps , a high ( 42.3 %) , statistically significant , frequency of the heterozygous genotype for the cyp2e1 * 6 allele was found among leprosy patients ( table 2 ) .
in the positive group , 63.2 % ( 12 patients ) exhibited this genotype , while in the negative group , a lower percentage ( 34.6 % , 18 patients ) was observed .
the frequency of the wild - type cyp2e1 * 1a and mutant cyp2e1 * 6 alleles in this population was 0.789 and 0.211 , respectively , which was statistically significant when the positive and negative groups were compared ( table 2 ) .

leprosy patients were also divided into two groups according to the baciloscopic index ( bi ) : a group with a low (< 3 ) bi ( lbi ) and a group with high (>= 3 ) bi ( hbi ) .
in addition to the analysis of the genotypic distribution of both cyp2e1 and gstm1 markers in the lbi and hbi groups ( table 3 ) , the combined effect of the two mutant alleles for the cyp2e1 and gstm1 genes ( cyp2e1 * 6 / gstm1 * 0 and cyp2e1 * 5 / gstm1 * 0 ) was also analyzed .
the mutant cyp2e1 * 5 allele was present in 37.5 % of the patients in the lbi group , while the wild - type cyp2e1 * 1a allele was observed in 92.3 % of the patients in the hbi group .
gstm1 gene analysis demonstrated that the mutant gstm1 * 0 allele was present in 56.2 % of the lbi group patients and in 38.5 % of the hbi group patients , while the wild - type gstm1 * 1 allele was present in 61.5 % of the hbi group patients ( table 3 ) .
the analysis of the combined effect revealed that the cyp2e1 * 6 / gstm1 * 0 genotypic combination was detected in 31.2 % of the patients in the lbi group , while the cyp2e1 * 5 / gstm1 * 0 genotypic combination was present in 28.1 % of the patients in the lbi group ; all were statistically significant when the different combinations were analyzed in the lbi or hbi groups .

next , we performed a logistic regression analysis in which the two groups , lbi and hbi , were dependent variables and with covariables that could interfere with the results of pb and mb clinical forms .
although the results were not statistically significant for different variables , such as gender and sequel , they were significant when related to cyp2e1 * 1a /* 5 ( p = 0.0266 ) and gstm1 * 0 ( p = 0.0500 ) genotypes .
these results suggest a strong association between both mutations and lbi ( table 4 ) .

discussion loss of sensation is the hallmark of leprosy diagnosis .
it is well known that both , mb and pb patients may evolve to nerve function impairment on the natural course of the disease [ 32 ] .
it is usual - and comprehensible as an objective tool - to use bi to analyze the correlation between a specific gene or a genotypic combination and the evolution of leprosy .
however , this cannot be the only parameter to evaluate in order to understand the disease behavior individually .
hbi may indicate m. leprae ability to grow inside the host in order to keep transmission chain and strain survival , or may indicate the inability of the host in constrain bacterial growth .
notwithstanding , the capacity of the human host immune system in dealing with leprosy infection with no sequel is rarely addressed .
in the present study two groups of patients were examined , and a striking difference when bi or disease evolution were evaluated were observed in relation to the genes investigated herein .
while cyp2e17632 * 1a /* 1a was associated to a worse disease progression , and the presence of the mutant cyp2e17632 * 1a /* 6 was associated with a good evolution , however , none of them were related to lbi or hbi .
these findings suggest that different genes may be related to disease progression or bacterial growth inhibition mechanisms .
furthermore , cyp2e11053 / 1293 * 1a /* 1a was associated with hbi , while there no significant association was observed for clinical evolution analyses. , cyp2e11053 / 1293 * 1a /* 5 was significantly associated with lbi and a better disease progression .
the availability of modern antibiotics can help us to better understand the disease , and it is reasonable to think that pharmacogenomics related genes may also be related to disease outcome in human hosts .
one of these key drugs is rifampicin .
rifampicin can be bacteriostatic at lower concentrations or bactericidal at higher concentrations .
when used alone , mycobacterium can readily develop resistance to rif , and therefore , treatment should not rely solely on this drug [ 15 ] .
its biotransformation occurs through a process of hepatic deacetylation , giving rise to the active metabolite desacetylrifampicin [ 26 ] .
rif has a high capacity for inducing cyp450 isoforms , which contributes to a 40 % reduction in half - life during the first half month of treatment and the acceleration of rif deacetylation .
therefore , this drug is capable of intensifying its own biotransformation , diminishing its plasmatic half - life when administered in multiple doses [ 33 ] .
studies of the cyp2e1 gene indicate that cyp2e1 * 6 and cyp2e1 * 5 alleles are associated with a higher level of transcription and microsomal enzyme activity ; therefore , they are implicated in enzymatic biotransformation activity augmentation [ 34 ] - [ 36 ] , consequently decreasing the half - life of rif .
our results show that among the patients grouped according to clinical progression , the heterozygous genotype cyp2e1 * 1a /* 6 was present in 63.2 % of the individuals in the (+) group .
the or analysis of the cyp2e1 * 6 allele demonstrated that this polymorphism provides protection to those individuals in the (+) group ( table 2 ) .
we hypothesize that the cyp2e1 * 6 allele could increased the rate of rifampicin metabolism .
augments the biotransformation by cyp450 enzymes and raising the levels of the active metabolite desacetylrifampicin , which has a higher bactericidal activity .
therefore , individuals with this mutation could more efficiently combat m. leprae .
a significant difference was found between healthy individuals and patients for the cyp2e1 * 6 allele , which is more common among leprosy patients ( x2 = 11.6 ; p = 0.003 ) .
since this association was unknown , more studies are necessary to confirm these results ( table 5 ) .
among leprosy patients , cyp2e1 * 5 allele was more frequent in the lbi group .
this allele was also more frequent in healthy subjects when compared to leprosy individuals .
these results taken together suggest that cyp2e1 * 5 is a protection factor that might be involved with bacterial growth inhibition ( table 5 ) .
for the gstm1 gene , the null genotype gstm1 * 0 was present in 56.2 % of the lbi group .
the compound distribution of the two mutant alleles cyp2e1 * 5 / gstm1 * 0 was present in 28.1 % of lbi the patients , while cyp2e1 * 6 / gstm1 * 0 was present in 31.2 % .
the estimated or suggest that mutant alleles confer protection for lbi individuals .
taken together , our results suggest that the cyp2e1 * 5 , cyp2e1 * 6 and gstm1 * 0 alleles may be considered as susceptibility markers for leprosy , and their distribution should be further investigated , as their presence seems to confer protection from m. leprae .

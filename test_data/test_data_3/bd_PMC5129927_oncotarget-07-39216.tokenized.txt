background bariatric surgery has emerged as a competitive strategy for obese patients .
however , its comparative efficacy against non - surgical treatments remains ill - defined , especially among nonseverely obese crowds .
therefore , we implemented a systematic review and meta - analysis in order for an academic addition to current literatures .
methods literatures were retrieved from databases of pubmed , web of science , embase and cochrane library .
randomized trials comparing surgical with non - surgical therapies for obesity were included .
a revised jadad 's scale and risk of bias summary were employed for methodological assessment .
subgroups analysis , sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment were respectively performed in order to find out the source of heterogeneity , detect the outcome stability and potential publication bias .
results 25 randomized trials were eligibly included , totally comprising of 1194 participants .
both groups displayed well comparability concerning baseline parameters ( p > 0.05 ) .
the pooled results of primary endpoints ( weight loss and diabetic remission ) revealed a significant advantage among surgical patients rather than those receiving non - surgical treatments ( p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , except for certain cardiovascular indicators , bariatric surgery was superior to conventional arms in terms of metabolic secondary parameters ( p < 0.05 ) .
additionally , the pooled outcomes were confirmed to be stable by sensitivity analysis .
although egger 's test ( p < 0.01 ) and begg 's test ( p < 0.05 ) had reported the presence of publication bias among included studies , " trim - and - fill " method verified that the pooled outcomes remained stable .
conclusion bariatric surgery is a better therapeutic option for weight loss , irrespective of follow - up duration , surgical techniques and obesity levels .
obesity bariatric surgery meta - analysis systematic review pathology section introduction emerging as a costly burden of global healthcare system , obesity has currently attracted worldwide attentions due to its uncontrollably rising incidence , especially in industrialized countries [ 1 ] .
economically , the annual expense directly linked to overweight ( body mass index 25 - 30 ) and obesity ( body mass index > 30 ) is estimated to be almost 16 billion pounds globally [ 2 ] .
during the past three decades , the epidemiological prevalence of obesity has quadrupled to 25 % among uk population , including 2.4 % of which are affected by morbid obesity ( body mass index > 40 ) [ 3 ] .
at present , it is appraised that approximately two thirds of overall population in us have been clinically diagnosed as overweight or obese [ 4 ] .
characterized by excessive adipose storage , obesity is commonly accompanied by a variety of comorbidities , mainly comprising of type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension and cardiovascular accidents .
as an integrative product of multifactorial impacts , a definite etiological explanation of obesity remains obscure , leading to the absence of effective strategies targeting its development [ 5 ] .
according to sages [ 6 ] and nice [ 7 ] guidelines , multicomponent interventions are currently the treatment of choice , including lifestyle intervention , dietary restriction , pharmaceutical and surgical management .
despite of its first - line status , non - surgical treatments lead to poor compliance and unfavorable endpoint satisfaction among obese patients .
as is reported , the glycemic control of obesity - related diabetes is merely accomplished amid 40 % of patients undergoing conventional medications [ 8 ] .
meanwhile , lifestyle reformation fails to reduce the probability of obesity - associated lethality as well as the hazards of cardiovascular accidents among obese crowds [ 9 ] .
bariatric surgery , initially reported in 1995 [ 10 ] , has been regarded as an effective supplement to current regimen , especially for those suffering from severe obesity ( body mass index > 40 ) [ 6 , 7 ]. by mechanically altering the physiological mode of gastrointestinal absorption , bariatric surgery triggers remarkable decline on excessive weight , hyperglycemia , cardiovascular risk and correlative mortality compared to conservative therapeutics [ 4 , 11 , 12 ] .
moreover , by meta - analyzing short - term observational studies , muller et al [ 8 ] has investigated that in contrast to non - surgical remedies , bariatric surgery favorably produces therapeutic benefit among patients with nonsevere obesity ( body mass index 30 - 35 ) , which is a vital addition to current guidelines that surgical intervention is recommended for patients with body mass index > 35 , especially the morbidly obese sufferers ( body mass index > 40 ) [ 6 ] .
therefore , the updated nice guidance ( cg189 ) has broadened the indications that as a second - line option , all patients with body mass index > 30 should be assessed for bariatric surgery following the refractoriness to non - surgical interventions [ 2 ] .
nevertheless , long - term ( 3 - year or more ) efficacy of surgical versus non - surgical interventions is rarely described , especially lacking of a well summarized evidence .
additionally , the clinical value of bariatric surgery for nonseverely obese patients requires further analysis .
hence we performed this systematic review and meta - analysis in order to comprehensively make comparisons between both strategies , aiming to provide novel evidences for future guidelines .
results general characteristics the preliminary 1076 entries were rigorously screened to generate 25 eligible studies for pooling analysis , with a total amount of 1194 participants and individually ranging from 16 to 150 ( figure 1a ) .
merely 2 studies were performed by developing nations while 14 trials originated from industrialized countries , each of australia and us accounting for the maximum amount of 5 .
none of the included trials featured adolescent subjects except for o'brien 2010 .
female patients dominated the sexuality proportion towards male counterparts , with a ratio of 740 to 454 .
among the included trials , in general , it was mutually comparable between both comparative interventions regarding the baseline confounding elements ( table 1 ) .

the overall amount of low risk subitems was 61 , followed by 37 of unclear risk and 14 of high risk , implying a substantially low risk of bias within our pooled analysis ( figure 1b ) .
primary endpoints weight loss overall patients undergoing surgical interventions had more weight loss than those receiving non - surgical managements ( p < 0.00001 ) ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 the forest plot of weight loss ( kg ) in terms of follow - up duration follow - up duration in terms of weight loss , surgical approach was superior to conventional strategies among patients with 1 - year ( p < 0.00001 ) , 2 - year ( p < 0.00001 ) or long - term ( 3 years or more ) follow - up duration ( p < 0.00001 ) ( figure 2 ) .
surgical techniques non - surgical therapeutics were unable to outstrip bariatric surgery regarding weight loss among obese patients , irrespective of sleeve gastrectomy ( p < 0.00001 ) , roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p < 0.00001 ) , laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p < 0.00001 ) and biliopancreatic diversion ( p < 0.00001 ) ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 the forest plot of weight loss ( kg ) in terms of surgical techniques levels of obesity among patients with nonsevere obesity ( body mass index 30 - 35 ; p < 0.00001 ) and severe obesity ( body mass index > 35 ; p < 0.00001 ) , metabolic surgery was a more effective tool for losing weight against non - surgical treatments ( figure 4 ) .
figure 4 the forest plot of weight loss ( kg ) in terms of obesity levels remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus overall our pooled outcomes suggested that surgical patients had a higher rate of diabetic remission than those undergoing non - surgical interventions ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
follow - up duration patients undergoing bariatric surgery achieved significantly higher rate of diabetic remission compared to recipients of conservative therapeutics , based on pooled results of 1 - year ( p < 0.0001 ) , 2 - year ( p = 0.004 ) and long - term follow - up ( p < 0.0001 ) ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
surgical techniques in contrast to conserved managements , there was a much better remission rate of diabetes amid surgical recipients , irrespective of sleeve gastrectomy ( p < 0.00001 ) , roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p < 0.00001 ) , laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p = 0.0008 ) and biliopancreatic diversion ( p = 0.001 ) ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
levels of obesity concerning the diabetic remission rate , both nonseverely ( p = 0.0004 ) and severely obese ( p < 0.0001 ) sufferers significantly benefited from surgical remedies , compared with non - surgical patients ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
secondary endpoints excessive weight loss overall among obese subjects , our quantitative analysis reported that operative treatments induced higher percentage of excessive weight loss against traditional therapeutics ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s4 ) .
follow - up duration regardless of 1 - year ( p < 0.00001 ) , 2 - year ( p < 0.00001 ) or long - range follow - up ( p = 0.006 ) , bariatric surgery was far more efficient to eliminate excessive weight than non - surgical interventions ( supplementary figure s4 ) .
surgical techniques it was a statistical advantage to surgically reduce the excessive mass of obese enrollees instead of conventional treatments , whichever of sleeve gastrectomy ( p < 0.00001 ) , roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p < 0.00001 ) , laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p = 0.0008 ) and biliopancreatic diversion ( p < 0.00001 ) was performed ( supplementary figure s5 ) .
levels of obesity recipients of bariatric surgery gained greater loss of excessive weight in comparison to those undergoing non - invasive treatments , according to the subgroup analysis of both nonsevere ( p < 0.00001 ) and severe obesity ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s6 ) .
fasting glucose overall a better alleviation on fasting glucose was observed among patients undergoing bariatric surgery , in contrast to those receiving conventional remedies ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s7 ) .
follow - up duration regardless of 1 - year ( p = 0.0005 ) , 2 - year ( p = 0.0003 ) or long - term follow - up ( p = 0.02 ) , surgical management was significantly effective in decreasing fasting glucose compared to non - surgical interventions ( supplementary figure s7 ) .
surgical techniques none of sleeve gastrectomy ( p = 0.0005 ) , roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p < 0.00001 ) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p < 0.0001 ) fell behind in fasting glucose reduction against conserved therapeutics , except for biliopancreatic diversion , which was statistically equivalent to contrastive group ( p = 0.05 ) ( supplementary figure s8 ) .
levels of obesity compared to non - surgical regimen , both nonseverely ( p = 0.001 ) and severely obese ( p < 0.00001 ) patients obtained greater downregulation on fasting glucose following the surgical interventions ( supplementary figure s9 ) .
glycated hemoglobin overall metabolic surgery led to more reduction on percentage of glycated hemoglobin among obese participants than conventional managements ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s10 ) .
follow - up duration a higher percentage reduction on glycated hemoglobin was surgically achieved among patients with 1 - year ( p < 0.00001 ) , 2 - year ( p = 0.02 ) and long - term follow - up ( p < 0.00001 ) , rather than those with conservative interventions ( supplementary figure s10 ) .
surgical techniques irrespective of sleeve gastrectomy ( p < 0.0001 ) , roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p < 0.00001 ) , laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p = 0.002 ) and biliopancreatic diversion ( p = 0.03 ) , bariatric surgery was significantly superior to non - surgical approaches in terms of reducing elevated glycated hemoglobin ( supplementary figure s11 ) .
levels of obesity there was a greater decrease on glycated hemoglobin percentage following bariatric operations than non - surgical strategies , among nonseverely ( p < 0.00001 ) and severely obese patients ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s12 ) .
waist circumference overall compared to baseline values , a greater loss on waist circumference was obtained amid surgical patients , instead of non - surgical counterparts ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s13 ) .
follow - up duration among the three subgroups of 1 - year ( p < 0.00001 ) , 2 - year ( p < 0.00001 ) and long - term follow - up ( p < 0.00001 ) , patients that were surgically treated obtained larger decline on waist circumference than those were conventionally cured ( supplementary figure s13 ) .
surgical techniques bariatric surgery was more effective to cut down waist circumference than non - surgical interventions , including sleeve gastrectomy ( p < 0.0001 ) , roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p < 0.00001 ) , laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p < 0.00001 ) and biliopancreatic diversion ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s14 ) .
levels of obesity based on the pooled outcomes featuring nonseverely ( p < 0.00001 ) and severely obese sufferers ( p < 0.00001 ) , more reduction on waist circumference was observed following surgical management in contrast to traditional treatments ( supplementary figure s15 ) .
systolic pressure overall with respect to decrease on systolic pressure among enrolled participants , metabolic surgery has a significant advantage against non - surgical remedies ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s16 ) .
follow - up duration regarding the efficacy of systolic pressure reduction , patients with 2 - year postoperative follow - up equaled to those receiving conventional interventions ( p = 0.30 ) , while bariatric surgery was a superior option among sufferers with 1 - year ( p = 0.001 ) and long - range follow - up ( p = 0.02 ) ( supplementary figure s16 ) .
surgical techniques bariatric surgery featuring sleeve gastrectomy ( p = 0.36 ) , laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p = 0.36 ) and biliopancreatic diversion ( p = 0.90 ) was statistically comparable with non - surgical strategies in terms of reduction on systolic pressure , except for the dominant efficacy of roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p = 0.007 ) ( supplementary figure s17 ) .
levels of obesity in comparison to conservative interventions , bariatric surgery played a preponderant and comparable role among nonseverely ( p < 0.00001 ) and severely obese patients ( p = 0.41 ) respectively , in terms of reduction on systolic pressure ( supplementary figure s18 ) .
diastolic pressure overall there was no significant difference between surgical and non - surgical strategies towards diastolic pressure reduction among included patients ( p = 0.50 ) ( supplementary figure s19 ) .
follow - up duration bariatric surgery had a comparable impact on attenuating diastolic pressure against conventional therapies , within patients being followed up for 1 - year ( p = 0.26 ) and 2 - year ( p = 0.55 ) .
however , surgical interventions were inferior to non - invasive remedies amid patients with long - term follow - up ( p = 0.03 ) ( supplementary figure s19 ) .
surgical techniques although roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p = 0.03 ) were in a significantly superior status , the remaining techniques were statistically comparable to conservative regimens concerning the decrease on diastolic pressure , inclusive of sleeve gastrectomy ( p = 0.67 ) , laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p = 0.57 ) and biliopancreatic diversion ( p = 0.52 ) ( supplementary figure s20 ) .
levels of obesity patients undergoing both interventions exhibited comparable efficacy on diastolic pressure reduction regardless of nonsevere obesity ( p = 0.23 ) and severe obesity ( p = 0.73 ) ( supplementary figure s21 ) .
triglycerides overall more decrease on triglycerides level was obtained among surgical participants , other than those receiving conventional therapies ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s22 ) .
follow - up duration according to our pooled outcomes , surgical patients with 1 - year ( p < 0.0001 ) and 2 - year ( p < 0.0001 ) follow - up had a greater decline on triglycerides level than those being conventionally treated , except for the comparable efficacy among patients with long - term follow - up ( p = 0.06 ) ( supplementary figure s22 ) .
surgical techniques in terms of reducing triglycerides level , roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p = 0.0005 ) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p = 0.004 ) exerted a more evident influence among enrolled patients , while sleeve gastrectomy ( p = 0.08 ) and biliopancreatic diversion ( p = 0.14 ) was therapeutically comparable with conventional remedies ( supplementary figure s23 ) .
levels of obesity patients that were surgically managed benefited from a greater loss on triglycerides level than those were non - surgically intervened , regardless of nonsevere obesity ( p < 0.00001 ) and severe obesity ( p < 0.0001 ) ( supplementary figure s24 ) .
total cholesterol overall comparing bariatric surgery and non - surgical interventions , the magnitude of total cholesterol reduction was independent of treatment strategies among obese patients ( p = 0.13 ) ( supplementary figure s25 ) .
follow - up duration among obese sufferers being followed up for 1 - year ( p = 0.18 ) and 2 - year ( p = 0.07 ) , there was no therapeutic difference between both interventions .
however , patients with long - term follow - up achieved more reduction on total cholesterol following non - surgical managements , in contrast to bariatric surgery ( p = 0.03 ) ( supplementary figure s25 ) .
surgical techniques besides the preponderant role of biliopancreatic diversion ( p = 0.004 ) , patients receiving bariatric surgery gained comparable efficacy of total cholesterol reduction against non - surgical enrollees , including sleeve gastrectomy ( p = 0.67 ) , roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p = 0.78 ) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p = 0.62 ) ( supplementary figure s26 ) .
levels of obesity patients with severe obesity featured a surgical advantage in terms of total cholesterol reduction ( p = 0.01 ) , while nonseverely obese counterparts reported no significant difference between surgical and non - surgical interventions ( p = 0.76 ) ( supplementary figure s27 ) .
high density lipoprotein overall a favorable outcome of surgical patients was observed due to their greater increase on high density lipoprotein against those were conservatively healed ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s28 ) .
follow - up duration despite of 1 - year ( p < 0.00001 ) , 2 - year ( p = 0.0005 ) and long - term follow - up ( p = 0.001 ) , metabolic surgery led to more increase on high density lipoprotein among included patients , compared to non - surgical recipients ( supplementary figure s28 ) .
surgical techniques the recipients of sleeve gastrectomy ( p = 0.003 ) and roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p < 0.00001 ) displayed a higher increase on high density lipoprotein .
however , the increase on high density lipoprotein was identically obtained between non - surgical treatments and bariatric surgery of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p = 0.19 ) and biliopancreatic diversion ( p = 0.27 ) ( supplementary figure s29 ) .
levels of obesity whether participants with nonsevere ( p < 0.00001 ) or severe obesity ( p < 0.00001 ) , bariatric surgery was a more capable pattern of elevating high density lipoprotein than traditional modes ( supplementary figure s30 ) .
low density lipoprotein overall among obese patients , both surgical and non - surgical interventions led to comparable efficacy in reduction of low density lipoprotein ( p = 0.21 ) ( supplementary figure s31 ) .
follow - up duration comparable to surgical patients with 1 - year ( p = 0.24 ) and 2 - year follow - up ( p = 0.14 ) , recipients of conventional strategies exceled those with long - term postoperative follow - up duration , with regard to the reduction on low density lipoprotein ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s31 ) .
surgical techniques based on subgroup statistics of sleeve gastrectomy ( p = 0.34 ) , roux - en - y gastric bypass ( p = 0.71 ) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( p = 0.46 ) , it was mathematically comparable between surgical and non - surgical patients regarding the decrease on low density lipoprotein .
nevertheless , patients undergoing biliopancreatic diversion had an advantage over those were conventionally cured ( p < 0.00001 ) ( supplementary figure s32 ) .
levels of obesity there was no statistical significance between bariatric surgery and non - surgical intervention concerning the reduction on low density lipoprotein , according to subgroup analysis of nonseverely ( p = 0.76 ) and severely obese patients ( p = 0.09 ) ( supplementary figure s33 ) .
sensitivity analysis firstly , by interchanging random - effects and fixed - effects models , the overall as well as subgroup outcomes of primary endpoints ( weight loss and diabetic remission ) were confirmed to be statistically stable ( table 3 ) .

thirdly , since o'brien 2010 merely contained adolescent participants , the inclusion criteria had been altered by excluding it from pooling analysis .
consequently , results of primary endpoints remained stable under circumstances of novel criteria ( table 3 ) .
fourthly , by individually removing the eligible studies from primary endpoints , the steadiness of our meta - analysis was graphically proved with aid of stata 12.0 ( supplementary figure s34 ) .
publication bias concerning the primary endpoints of weight loss ( egger : 0.002 ; begg : 0.003 ) and diabetic remission ( egger : 0.001 ; begg : 0.043 ) , egger 's test and begg 's test consistently confirmed the presence of publication bias among the included studies ( supplementary figure s35 ) .
however , by " trim and fill " method , the pooled outcomes were mathematically equivalent although 2 trials were added for weight loss ( before : p < 0.00001 ; after : p < 0.0001 ) and 6 added for diabetic remission ( before : p < 0.00001 ; after : p < 0.0001 ) ( supplementary figure s36 ) .
discussion although golomb et al had retrospectively doubted the dominant role of bariatric surgery at 5 - year follow - up [ 38 ] , its contrastive efficacy against non - surgical interventions remains advantageous according to our pooled analysis , especially concerning the long - term durability of weight loss and hyperglycemic remission .
it is experimentally explanatory that physiological adaptation instead of mechanical reconstruction seems to mainly contribute to the prolonged impacts on energy homeostasis .
adaptive gastrointestinal remodeling , neuroendocrine hormone changes , bile acid signaling and gut microbiota adjustment play combined roles in ameliorating metabolic abnormality and sustaining postoperative energy balance [ 39 ] .
nevertheless , along with the increasing follow - up period , the cardiovascular improvement has been therapeutically offset among patients undergoing bariatric surgery , which is confirmed by the comparable outcomes of certain endpoints in our pooled analysis ( systolic pressure , diastolic pressure , total cholesterol and low - density lipoprotein ) .
hence , distant benefits of cardiovascular disorders remain controversial following bariatric surgery , despite gloy et al [ 4 ] had convinced surgeons with short - term advantages on cardiovascular indicators .
the close interplay between obesity , diabetes and cardiovascular diseases has been extensively investigated [ 40 ] .
following improvements on metabolic status , the lowered risk of cardiovascular accidents is relatively comprehensible among patients with short - term period of follow - up. thus the long - term insignificance on cardiovascular endpoints seems to blame on those mechanisms independent of ameliorated obesity and hyperglycemia .
one possible explanation is that except for biliopancreatic diversion , the prevalent surgical styles including sleeve gastrectomy , roux - en - y and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding fail to adequately impose on cholesterol homeostasis than medication of statins , which consequently culminates in angiosclerosis and hypertension .
besides , cardiovascular dysfunctions are easier to be emotionally and genetically affected , which is inappropriate to simply identify it as metabolic comorbidities [ 41 , 42 ] .
it is empirically regarded that compared to severe obesity , patients suffering from nonsevere obesity manifest with better general conditions which makes it more economical to be conventionally cured .
however , deriving from our pooled evidence , nonseverely obese patients should rather receive bariatric surgery than conservative managements , which is similar to those featuring morbid obesity and is a vital addition to current literatures .
adolescent obesity and overweight crowds have been targeted as further research highlights of bariatric surgery .
uncontrollable weight increase has severer impacts on pubescents than adults , simultaneously damaging their sexual development and intelligence growth [ 43 ] .
o'brien et al [ 23 ] had reported a randomized trial constituted by juveniles that laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding led to more reduction on excess weight than lifestyle intervention , as well as improved life - quality .
however , more persuasive investigations are still needed to clarify its clinical worthiness on teenager obesity .
additionally , a substantial proportion of diabetic patients are just overweight instead of clinically obese .
but the actual role of bariatric surgery among such populations remains undetermined. by a randomized research , wentworth et al [ 44 ] firstly described a favorable effect of glycemic control and weight loss among overweight patients undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in contrast to those with non - surgical treatments .
this probably hints that bariatric surgery may fit for all crowds with weight redundancy despite long - term and pooled evidences are scarce .
notwithstanding the statistical outcomes are of great strength in both methodology and statistics , there are still some limitations within .
first of all , the internal heterogeneity is still in a considerable level despite the subgroup analyses have been additionally performed .
difference from chemical examination methods , surgical manipulation techniques and diversified non - surgical interventions ( life - style and medications ) may contribute to inerasably internal heterogeneity .
more accurate grouping on different confounding factors may benefit the source seeking of heterogeneity .
secondly , raw data of life - quality and survival prognostication are inadequate for meta - analyzing , making it less valuable in terms of comparisons on life expectancy .
moreover , mutual comparison of financial burdens is still lacking , blockading a more comprehensive appraisal of both strategies .
taken together , despite of the shortcomings of surgical therapeutics ( a forced alteration of diet habits ; large load of exercise required ; 8 % of revision rate ) [ 45 ] , bariatric surgery is a more efficient technique for ameliorating obesity and its relevant comorbidities , in contrast to non - surgical interventions .
however , more rigorously designed trials with long - term follow - up duration are still required for future supplements and updates .
materials and methods in line with the prisma checklist [ 46 ] and cochrane collaboration protocols [ 47 ] , the pooled analysis was designed and implemented in a standard manner .
the entire procedures were independently performed by two investigators .
any discrepancy was resolved by mutual discussion .
search strategy in order to guarantee the integrity of literature retrieval , databases of pubmed , web of science , embase and cochrane library were electronically searched with a search term " bariatric randomized or bariatric randomised or obesity surgery " .
both abstracts and full - texts were elaborately examined for fear of omission or ineligible inclusion .
additionally , citation lists of formerly published meta - analysis were screened as well .
study selection studies were eligibly included because of the following criteria : 1 .
english - written and officially published trials until december 2015 ; 2 .
randomized controlled trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of surgical versus non - surgical interventions among obese patients ( body mass index > 30 ) ; 3 .
adequate raw data of interested endpoints including metabolic and cardiovascular indicators ; studies were eventually eliminated due to the following reasons : 1 .
duplicated publications ; 2 .
inadequate sample - size (< 10 ) ; 3 .
lack of follow - up materials ; data extraction with regard to baseline , primary ( weight loss ; remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus ) and secondary parameters ( excessive weight loss ; fasting glucose ; glycated hemoglobin ; waist circumference ; systolic pressure ; diastolic pressure ; triglycerides ; total cholesterol ; high density lipoprotein ; low density lipoprotein ) , a well - prepared electronic form was designed to facilitate date extraction from tables , figures , text contents and supplementary information within the eligible trials .
overlapped data deriving from a single registered trial was mathematically combined to prevent repetitive counting .
all continuous variables were rounded to one decimal place .
methodological assessment firstly , a revised jadad 's scale [ 48 ] was employed in order for a rigorous appraisal of the study design .
a total of four categories consisted of the scale , including randomization , allocation concealment , blindness and withdrawal , with a maximum score of seven .
studies graded with four points or more were identified as high - quality trials ( table 4 ) .
table 4 revised jadad 's scale random sequence production a. adequate ( computer generated random numbers or similar methods ) ( 2 points ) b. unclear ( a randomized trial but without description of randomization methods ) ( 1 point ) c. inadequate ( an alternative allocation without randomization ) ( 0 point ) allocation concealment a. adequate ( a central institution - controlled allocation ) ( 2 points ) b. unclear ( random numerical table or other similar methods ) ( 1 point ) c. inadequate ( alternative allocation without adequate concealment ) ( 0 point ) blindness a. adequate ( comparable placebo or similar methods ) ( 2 points ) b. unclear ( a blind trial without details statement ) ( 1 point ) c. inadequate ( inappropriate blind methods or non - blind trials ) ( 0 point ) withdrawal a. description ( a detailed statement about the numbers and reasons of withdrawals ) ( 1 point ) b. no description ( no statement about the numbers and reasons of withdrawals ) ( 0 point ) secondly , as an addition to revised jadad 's scale , review manager 5.3 assisted us to summarize the risk of bias amid the qualified literatures .
the symbol of green , yellow and red represented low risk of bias , unclear risk of bias and high risk of bias respectively , in terms of seven constituted categories ( random sequence generation ; allocation concealment ; blinding of participants and personnel ; blinding of outcome assessment ; incomplete outcome data ; selective reporting ; other bias ) .
the higher proportion that green occupies , the lower risk of bias there is [ 47 ] .
statistical methods review manager 5.3 was employed as a statistical platform for our quantitative analysis .
the effect - sizes of dichotomous and continuous variable were calculated by models of odds ratio and weighted mean difference respectively , along with 95 % confidence interval .
if the source data on endpoints were not offered explicitly , median was statistically regarded as mean while standard deviation was derived from range , interquartile range or 95 % confidence interval as appropriate [ 47 , 49 ] .
a demand - based merging of subgroups was rigorously conducted to enable sole pairwise comparisons .
if necessary , numeric change from baseline values was computed in accord with the statistical instructions of cochrane handbook [ 47 ] .
the overall statistical heterogeneity was quantified by the degree of inconsistency ( i2 ) [ 50 ] .
revealing a substantially lower heterogeneity , the fixed - effects model was recommended in the setting of i2 < 25 % .
otherwise a random - effects model was preferred under the remaining circumstances [ 51 ] , in order for adjustment of potential variations across the retrieved studies .
for the sake of detecting internal stability , sensitivity analysis was accomplished via eliminating low - quality trials , exclusion of controversial studies and comparing the outcome variation between fixed - effects and random - effects models .
moreover , the incorporated outcomes were additionally classified into various subgroups for purpose of more specific and instructive discoveries. with aid of stata 12.0 , publication bias was numerically examined by begg 's test and egger 's test [ 52 ] .
a " trim and fill " method was conducted in the setting of significant publication bias , in order for adding inadequate studies as well as examining the stability of outcomes .
significant difference was denoted as p < 0.05 .

objective to evaluate glycemic variability associated with two different premixed insulin analogue formulations when used in a twice - daily regimen .
patients and methods subjects comprised type 2 diabetic patients aged 20 - 79 years , treated with twice daily premixed insulin or insulin analogue formulations .
all subjects were hospitalized for 6 days and randomized to receive either humalog mix 25 ( mix 25 ) or humalog mix 50 ( mix 50 ) .
they were then crossed over to the other arm between day 3 and day 4 of the study .
continuous glucose monitoring ( cgm ) was performed on all subjects to examine the differences in glycemic variability .
results eleven type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled .
no significant difference was found in 24 - hour mean glucose values and their sds , pre - meal glucose values , increases from pre - meal to peak glucose values , or time to peak glucose levels between either group .
however , the mean glucose values observed during 0 - 8 hrs were significantly lower with mix 25 compared to mix 50 ( 128 vs. 147 mg / dl ; p = 0.024 ) .
conclusions the twice - daily mix 25 regimen provided superior overnight glycemic control compared to the mix 50 regimen in japanese patients with type 2 diabetes .
however , both twice - daily regimens with either mix 25 or mix 50 provided inadequate post - lunch glycemic control .
trial registration current controlled trials umin000001327 introduction results from the diabetes control complications trial ( dcct ) [ 1 ] and the kumamoto study [ 2 ] demonstrated that in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes , intensive insulin therapy combining regular - and intermediate - acting insulin formulations , provides a significantly greater improvement in hba1c values and reduces the onset and progression of diabetes - associated microangiopathy to a greater degree , than conventional insulin therapy .
these findings have led to intensive insulin therapy being proactively and increasingly used in diabetic patients .
following these results , several clinical studies involving insulin analogue mixtures have been conducted , which have consistently demonstrated that there is no significant difference in efficacy between twice - daily regimens with insulin analogue mixtures and intensive insulin therapy .
representative of these , the 4t study [ 3 ] showed no significant difference in improvement in hba1c values between patients treated with intensive insulin therapy plus an oral anti - diabetic drug ( oadd ) , and those treated with a twice - daily mixed insulin analogue regimen plus an oadd .
similar results have been reported from two independent japanese studies , the joint and jddm11 studies [ 4,5 ] , conducted in patients with sulfonylurea secondary failure , which compared the efficacy between intensive insulin therapy and twice - daily regimens with insulin analogue mixtures .
these results suggested that twice - daily regimens with insulin analogue mixtures are as effective as intensive insulin therapy in improving hba1c values .
in recent years , insulin analogues combined at different blend ratios ( humalog mix 25 : 25 % lispro , 75 % protaminated lispro , " mix 25 " hereafter ; humalog mix 50 : 50 % lispro , 50 % protaminated lispro , " mix 50 " hereafter ) have become commercially available .
however there have been no reports comparing the effect of these premixed insulin analogue formulations on glycemic variability when used in a twice - daily regimen .
therefore , we conducted a cross - over study in type 2 diabetic subjects treated with an identical diet , and used continuous glucose monitoring ( cgm ) to compare glycemic variability associated with a twice - daily regimen of either mix 25 or. mix 50 .
patients and methods study subjects comprised type 2 diabetic patients aged between 20 and less than 80 years old , who were treated with premixed insulin preparations or premixed insulin analogue formulations , twice daily .
informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to starting the study .
subjects were hospitalized during the 6 - day study period , and were randomized to receive either mix 25 or mix 50 .
on day 3 - 4 subjects crossed over to the other study arm .
insulin injections were given twice daily 0 - 15 min before breakfast and before supper .
all subjects received the same insulin dose during hospitalization ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 study protocol .
the subjects received test meals consisting of the same nutrients and equivalent caloric intake on days 3 and 5 .
the total caloric intake for subjects was defined by the attending physicians , as 1,440 kcal ( group 1 ) , 1600 kcal ( group 2 ) , or 1,840 kcal ( group 3 ) per day to accommodate differences in physique among the subjects .
a standardized test meal was given for breakfast , irrespective of differences in physique ( total calories , 460 kcal ; carbohydrates , 49.1 % ; proteins , 15.7 % ; and lipids , 35.2 %) [ 6 ] and commonly available foods were given for lunch and supper .
midday meals accounted for a total caloric intake of 455 kcal ( carbohydrates , 62.2 % ; proteins , 16.6 % ; and lipids , 21.2 %) in group 1 ; 571 kcal ( carbohydrates , 59.9 % ; proteins , 15.7 % ; and lipids , 24.4 %) in group 2 ; and 684 kcal ( carbohydrates , 65.2 % ; proteins , 14.1 % ; and lipids , 20.7 %) in group 3 .
evening meals accounted for a total caloric intake of 465 kcal ( carbohydrates , 56.9 % ; proteins , 21.6 % ; and lipids , 21.5 %) in group 1 ; 589 kcal ( carbohydrates , 57.7 % ; proteins , 20.3 % ; and lipids , 22.0 %) in group 2 ; and 702 kcal ( carbohydrates , 63.2 % ; proteins , 14.1 % ; and lipids , 18.7 %) in group 3 .
the subjects were instructed to refrain from excessive physical activity , and to maintain a similar level of physical activity on days 3 and 5 when the test meals were given .
cgm was performed on all subjects using the cgms system gold ( medtronic inc . )
[ 7 ] , which measures blood glucose every 10 seconds , recording mean values every 5 minutes .
therefore , 288 measurements were recorded daily , providing sufficient information to understand diurnal blood glucose variations .
the mean glucose concentrations and their standard deviations ( sds ) were calculated using the cgms data from 0 - 24 hrs on day 3 and day 5 .
mean 24 - hour glucose concentrations and their sds , pre - meal glucose concentrations , postprandial peak glucose concentrations , increases from pre - meal to peak glucose concentrations , and the time from pre - meal to peak glucose concentrations were compared using the student t - test .
additionally , mean glucose values were compared between overnight values ( from 0 - 8 hrs ) and those obtained from 8 - 24 hrs .
at the end of the study , cgm results were disclosed to all subjects , and the insulin regimen was chosen for each patient on the basis of his / her preference .
statistical analyses were performed using spss 16.0 [ 8 ] .
the current study was approved by the jikei university school of medicine ethics committee and was registered as clinical trial umin000001327 [ 9 ] .

no significant difference was found in 24 - hour mean glucose concentrations and their sds between those given mix 25 and those given mix 50 ( 176 vs. 187 mg / dl ; 50 vs. 49 mg / dl ) .
similarly , there was no significant difference between mix 25 and mix 50 in pre - meal glucose concentrations ( 144 vs. 172 mg / dl in the morning , 151 vs. 153 mg / dl in the daytime , and 161 vs. 177 mg / dl in the evening ) ; increase from pre - meal to peak glucose concentrations ( 93 vs. 85 mg / dl in the morning , 113 vs. 138 mg / dl in the daytime , and 76 vs. 59 mg / dl in the evening ) ; and time to peak glucose concentrations ( 98 vs. 93 minutes in the morning , 136 vs. 131 minutes in the daytime , and 81 vs. 71 minutes in the evening ) ( table 2 ) .

when changes in the 24 - hour mean glucose value were plotted over time , the overnight glucose level was more favorable with mix 25 ( figure 2 ) .
however , despite this , asymptomatic overnight hypoglycemia 60 mg / dl or lower was observed in 2 patients ( 18 %) with mix 25 , while no overnight hypoglycemia was observed with mix 50 .
figure 2 changes in mean glucose concentrations over time with twice - daily mix 25 ( solid line ) vs. mix 50 ( dotted line ) regimens in 11 type 2 diabetic patients .
at the end of the study , when patients were shown their cgm data and asked to choose their insulin regimen , more patients ( 7 patients ; 63.6 %) chose mix 25 over mix 50 , given that better glycemic control was noted with mix 25 overnight while it was not significantly different from that with mix 50 during the day .
discussion a detailed analysis of differences in glycemic variability with mix 25 versus mix 50 was performed using cgm in type 2 diabetic patients on insulin therapy .
the mean overnight glucose concentration was significantly higher with mix 50 than mix 25 , with the pre - breakfast glucose value tending to be higher with mix 50 .
however , the increases in glucose after breakfast were non - significantly smaller with mix 50 , which had a greater rapid insulin component than mix 25 .
the pre - lunch glucose values were similar for both groups .
in contrast , the increase in glucose concentration after lunch was smaller with mix 25 , which had a greater intermediate - acting insulin component .
this resulted in the pre - supper glucose values tending to be slightly higher with mix 50 .
the increases in the evening glucose concentration were smaller with mix 50 , similar to that noted after breakfast , although these increases were not significantly different from those reported for mix 25 .
study results clearly demonstrated that the changes in overnight glucose concentration were significantly lower with mix 25 , which had a greater intermediate - acting insulin component than mix 50 .
the differences in overnight changes between mix 25 and mix 50 were evident in each study participant , which led to a non - significantly greater proportion of the study participants ( 63.6 %) choosing mix 25 over mix 50 .
however , patients need to be aware that mix 25 is associated with a potentially greater risk for asymptomatic overnight hypoglycemia .
post - prandial increases in glucose concentration reflected the differing blend ratios of rapid insulin between mix 25 and mix 50 , although this did not result in significant differences .
interestingly , however , the time to peak glucose concentration did not clearly reflect these differing rapid insulin blend ratios , suggesting that these ratios mainly affected the post - meal increases in glucose concentration .
our study results also demonstrated that twice - daily mix 25 or mix 50 regimens provided inadequate glycemic control after lunch for approximately 4 hours .
this suggests that insulin analogue injections 3 times daily are preferable to 2 times daily to achieve improved glycemic control and furthermore that mix 25 injected 3 times daily or mix 50 injected before breakfast and lunch followed by mix 25 before supper could represent an ideal insulin regimen .
in this regard , rosenstock et al compared a 3 times - daily mix 50 regimen to intensive insulin therapy ( glargine at bedtime plus mealtime lispro ) in patients with inadequate glycemic control [ 10 ] .
similar findings were observed between the two arms with regard to improvement in hba1c values or diurnal variations in blood glucose concentration .
in regard to differences in glycemic variation resulting from differing blend ratios of mixed insulin analogue preparations , hirao et al [ 11 ] reported on a cross - over study comparing biphasic insulin aspart 50 ( biasp50 ) and 30 ( biasp30 ) in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes .
using the euglycemic clamp technique , he demonstrated that both the serum insulin level and glucose infusion rate ( gir ) were higher with biasp50 than with biasp30 .
to the best of our knowledge , there are only two studies reported in the literature comparing premixed insulin analogue formulations and premixed insulin formulations .
these were a cross - over study of biphasic insulin aspart 30 ( biasp30 ) versus biphasic human insulin 30 ( bhi 30 ) in 13 type 2 diabetic patients [ 12 ] and a randomized controlled trial of biasp 30 versus bhi 30 in 294 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [ 13 ] .
results from both studies demonstrated that postprandial glucose increases were suppressed to a significantly greater extent with biasp30 than with bhi 30 .
limitations of the present study include the following : study subjects had a relatively long mean duration of disease ( 18 years ) and it is possible that the results may be different if patients with a shorter duration of disease were included ; that although a cross - over study design was used , it may not have been adequately powered given the small sample size ( 11 patients ) ; and that differences detected may have been found to be significant if more patients were included .
in conclusion , our study clearly demonstrates that a twice - daily mix 25 regimen provides superior overnight glycemic control compared to twice - daily mix 50 in japanese patients with type 2 diabetes .
however , the twice - daily regimen of both mix 25 and mix 50 provided inadequate post - lunch glycemic control .
a randomized comparative trial of 3 times - daily regimens with mix 25 versus mix 50 in asian patients needs to be carried out in the future in order to establish insulin regimens that provide better glycemic control .

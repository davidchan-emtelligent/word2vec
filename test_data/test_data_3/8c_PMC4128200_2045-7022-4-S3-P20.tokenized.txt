besides , the pathomechanisms or mediators of viral reactivations are largely unknown .
in this study , we aimed to investigate the cytokine / chemokine profiles before or concurrent with hhv reactivations .
method we conducted a prospective study to evaluate hhv - 6 , epstein - - barr virus ( ebv ) and cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) reactivation rates in various cadrs .
dynamic changes of cytokines and chemokines were also determined by sequential blood tests during acute stages .
interleukin - 1pound ] ( il - 1pound ]) , il - 1 receptor antagonist ( il - 1ra ) , il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 6 , il - 7 , il - 8 , il - 9 , il - 10 , il - 12 , il - 13 , il - 15 , il - 17 , basic fibroblast growth factors , eotaxin , granulocyte colony - stimulating factor , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor , interferon - pound ^ ( ifn - pound ^) , interferon pound ^ - induced protein - 10 ( ip - 10 ) , monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 , macrophage inflammatory protein - 1pound \ ( mip - 1pound \) , mip - 1pound ] , platelet - derived growth factor , chemokine ( c - c motif ) ligand 5 ( ccl5 ) , tumor necrosis factor - pound \ ( tnf - pound \) and vascular endothelial growth factor were measured using the bio - plex human cytokine 27 - plex panel .
results a total of 62 patients were enrolled in this prospective study including 23 dress , 17 sjs / ten , 13 mpe , 5 gbfde and 4 emm .
hhv - 6 reactivation was observed in ten dress patients ( 43.5 %) but in none of the other cadr patients .
in contrast , ebv reactivation was detected in 35 patients distributed in every cadr groups .
ebv reactivation rates were 73.9 % for dress ( 17 in 23 patients ) , 29.4 % for sjs / ten ( 5 in 17 patients ) , 53.8 % for mpe ( 7 in 13 patients ) , 80 % for gbfde ( 4 in 5 patients ) , and 50 % for emm ( 2 in 4 patients ) .
cmv reactivation rates were 43.5 % in dress ( 10 in 23 patients ) and 11.8 % in sjs / ten ( 2 in 17 patients ) respectively , but none of the other cadrs .
hhv - 6 reactivation in dress patients was associated with decreased proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines ( il - 1pound ] , il - 1ra , il - 2 , tnf - pound \ , ifn - pound ^ , and mip - 1pound \) before viral reactivations .
only one chemokine , ip - 10 , was expressed higher in the hhv - 6 reactivation group ( p = 0.018 ) .
conclusions hhv - 6 reactivation in dress was associated with dysregulation of microenvironments mediated by several cytokines and chemokines .

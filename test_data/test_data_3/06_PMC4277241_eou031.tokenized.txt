rising caesarean section rates worldwide despite the world health organization 's ( who ) recommendation that caesarean section ( c - section ) rates should not exceed 15 % [ 1 ] , the high rates in some countries are cause for concern .
for example , italy , china , mexico and brazil all have rates higher than 36 % [ 2 ] with great variation within each nation .
the need for c - section has probably increased for many reasons , including rising rates of obesity , diabetes and maternal age , but rates more than twice the who recommendation probably reflect more than medical necessity .
although the lives of millions of mothers and infants have been saved by c - section , surgical delivery is not without costs .
risks to mothers include haemorrhage , pulmonary embolism , sepsis and death [ 3 ] as well as compromised breastfeeding and bonding [ 4 ] .
c - sections may carry risk for infants regarding respiratory , metabolic , gastrointestinal and immune function [ 5 ] .
finally , there is increasing evidence for epigenetic changes with c - section [ 6 ] suggesting that it may not be just the mother and infant who are affected by surgical deliveries , but there may be transgenerational effects .
evolutionary perspectives on difficult birth many birth complications today can be attributed to modern lifestyles and technology , but challenging birth can be traced to the origin of bipedalism 5 - 7 million years ago [ 7 ] .
bipedalism restructured the pelvis , altering the birth mechanism so that the infant usually emerges occiput anterior , making it advantageous to have assistance [ 7 ] .
worldwide it is extremely unusual for women to give birth alone .
assistance at birth is deeply rooted in human evolutionary history and may explain evidence that social support has a positive impact on birth outcomes [ 8 ] .
implications fear of birth or tocophobia is a common reason for electing to give birth by c - section .
the evolutionary perspective argues that fear and the deeply rooted need for assistance during birth can often be alleviated with emotional support such as provided by doulas , thus avoiding unnecessary risky and costly c - section .

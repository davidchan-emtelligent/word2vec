background while oral health is part of general health and well - being , oral health disparities nevertheless persist .
potential mechanisms include socioeconomic factors that may influence access to dental care in the absence of universal dental care insurance coverage .
we investigated the evolution , prevalence and determinants ( including socioeconomic ) of forgoing of dental care for economic reasons in a swiss region , over the course of six years .
methods repeated population - based surveys ( 2007 - 2012 ) of a representative sample of the adult population of the canton of geneva , switzerland .
forgone dental care , socioeconomic and insurance status , marital status , and presence of dependent children were assessed using standardized methods .
results a total of 4313 subjects were included , 10.6 % ( 457 / 4313 ) of whom reported having forgone dental care for economic reasons in the previous 12 months .
the crude percentage varied from 2.4 % in the wealthiest group ( monthly income >= 13,000chf , 1chf =~ 1 $) to 23.5 % among participants with the lowest income (< 3,000chf ) .
since 2007 / 8 , forgoing dental care remained stable overall , but in subjects with a monthly income of < 3,000chf , the adjusted percentage increased from 16.3 % in 2007 / 8 to 20.6 % in 2012 ( p trend = 0.002 ) .
forgoing dental care for economic reasons was independently associated with lower income , younger age , female gender , current smoking , having dependent children , divorced status and not living with a partner , not having a supplementary health insurance , and receipt of a health insurance premium cost - subsidy .
conclusions in a swiss region without universal dental care insurance coverage , prevalence of forgoing dental care for economic reasons was high and highly dependent on income .
efforts should be made to prevent high - risk populations from forgoing dental care .

keywords dental care forgoing socioeconomic status insurance issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background oral health is a component of overall health , and oral illness is associated with several adverse health effects [ 1 ] .
in meta - analyses , periodontis ( i.e. , chronic inflammation of structures that hold the tooth ) has been associated with coronary heart disease [ 2 ] , respiratory disease [ 3 ] , and preterm birth [ 4 ] - although the evidence remains weak due to a limited number of low quality studies .
there is also a growing body of literature linking oral illness to other chronic medical conditions such as type ii diabetes , osteoporosis , alzheimer 's disease and cognitive functioning [ 5 - 9 ] .
the evidence for global oral health disparities ( i.e. , lower socioeconomic status being associated with greater oral disease ) is well documented [ 10 , 11 ] , both in general adult and elderly populations [ 12 - 14 ] .
the world health organization ( who ) has called for the reduction of inequity in oral health as one of its major worldwide goals [ 15 ]. with respect to the use of dental care , considerable socioeconomic inequalities at both the individual ( intra - country ) and collective ( inter - country ) levels across europe and worldwide has been reported [ 16 , 17 ] .
using data from the swedish national surveys of public health for 2004 - 2005 , it has been shown that access to dental care explained 60 % of the socioeconomic differential in oral health , while lifestyle factors explained only 29 % of the gap [ 18 ] .
previous studies have identified several factors associated with the use and non - use of dental care [ 18 - 22 ] .
among these , the strongest independent factors of utilizing dental care appeared to be income and insurance [ 19 , 20 ] with an effect that is probably modulated by the type of healthcare system .
in several countries , healthcare systems do not cover ( e.g. , switzerland ) or only partially ( e.g. france ) cover dental care ; any covered costs are generally limited to curative , but not preventive care [ 23 , 24 ] .
thus , dental care costs are paid out - of - pocket on a fee - for - services basis to private dentists , a serious financial barrier to dental care , especially among economically vulnerable populations .
in france , for example , the prevalence of the forgoing dental care for economic reasons has been shown to be higher in regions ( i.e. , departments ) where dental procedure rates are highest [ 25 ] .
this issue of access to dental care is of major concern because economically vulnerable populations are the most in need of this service [ 26 , 27 ] .
while the conceptual model for oral health inequalities is complex , differential access to dental care may contribute to oral health disparities , given that forgoing dental care due to financial hardship is associated with poorer oral health in several prior reports [ 28 - 32 ] .
in switzerland , dental insurance and direct dental care is not publicly subsidized , and thus it is probable that some individuals choose to forgo dental care .
until 2011 , little was known about forgone healthcare for economic reasons in switzerland .
we have explored the importance of forgoing healthcare for economic reasons in switzerland in two previous population - based studies [ 33 , 34 ] ; we found that one out of seven participants reported having forgone healthcare for economic reasons in the previous 12 - month of the survey ( 2007 - 2010 ) .
this high prevalence was confirmed in a recent multicenter cross - sectional survey conducted among general practitioners working in the french - speaking part of switzerland who enrolled a random sample of patients attending their private practices [ 35 ] .
while specific population - based data on forgoing dental care for economic reasons are lacking in switzerland , there is evidence that dental care is the most frequent type of forgone care [ 33 , 34 ] , and that meaningful socioeconomic disparities in oral health for both adults ( e.g. , periodontal disease ) and children ( e.g. , dental caries ) exist in switzerland [ 36 ] .
accordingly , a recent popular initiative has been launched in two swiss cantons ( vaud : about 734,300 inhabitants ; and valais about 321,700 inhabitants ) to implement a dental care insurance coverage that will be supported by part of the income tax ( 0.5 % employee , 0.5 % employer ) [ 37 ] .
in this aforementioned disparities context , and given the paucity of data on this topic in switzerland , we aimed to determine the evolution , prevalence , and determinants of forgoing dental care for economic reasons in a swiss population , over six years .
methods surveyed population we used data from the bus sante study [ 34 ] .
the bus sante study is an ongoing cross - sectional population - based study that collects information on cardiovascular risk factors in the canton of geneva ( switzerland ) [ 38 ] .
the canton of geneva is a french - speaking urban state that differs from other cantons of switzerland by several features , such as population density ( including medical density ) , gdp per capita , education , proportion of foreign subjects , and unemployment ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
subjects are selected independently throughout each year to represent the canton 's non - institutionalized adult residents .
eligible subjects are identified using a list of residents established by the local government .
this listing includes all potential eligible participants except persons living illegally in the country .
exclusion criteria for the bus sante are 1 ) age < 35 or > 75 year old or 2 ) being institutionalized .
stratified random sampling is used to select participants by gender within each five - year age stratum , selecting a number of participants that is proportional to the corresponding population distribution .
each participant receives several self - administered , standardized questionnaires .
there are no language restrictions , as long as the participants are able to understand and answer the questionnaires .
the 2007 - 2012 participation rates varied between 58 % and 62 % .
participants from the six waves of the annual surveys were combined and used as the surveyed population , except in the estimation of the annual trends .
the bus sante study was approved by the ethical research committee of the geneva university hospitals ( 10 - 030r ) and all study participants provided written informed consent .
variables forgoing dental care for economic reasons two variables were used to measure economic barriers to dental care .
participants were asked , " during the previous 12 months , have you forgone any healthcare for economic reasons ? ?
" if yes , which type of care ?:" if any were checked off , participants specified which one ( s ) among the list of 12 non - mutually exclusive types of care forgone ; one of these was " dental care. " respondents who answered " yes " and " dental care " were considered as having forgone dental care for economic reasons within the previous year .
these questions are different yet very similar to questions used in prior published reports [ 20 , 28 , 39 , 40 ]. of note , information on the type of dental care ( e.g. , preventive ) forgone was not collected .
demographics and socioeconomic factors participants were grouped by age : < 45 years , 45 - 64 years , and >= 65 years .
citizenship was categorized as swiss or non - swiss .
information on marital status and dependent children at home ( age < 15 years ) was collected .
based on previous research [ 34 ] , we considered having children aged < 15 years as a better predictor of forgoing care than " having children in general " because children aged < 15 years do not have a regular income .
occupational position was categorized into " high " ( self - employed and / or non - manual [ i.e. , person who performs professional , managerial , or administrative work such as teacher , journalist , salesperson , nurse ) and " low " ( salaried and / or manual [ i.e. , person whose occupation requires manual labor such as forestry worker , factory worker , plumber ]) , education level ( high [>= 13 years ] and low [< 13 years ]) , and monthly household income (< chf 3000 / month , 3000 - 4999 , 5000 - 6999 , 7000 - 9499 , 9500 - 12999 , >= 13000 ) were used as indicators of socioeconomic status .
if the individual was retired , information on his / her last occupation was used to define his / her occupational position category .
healthinsurance status and smoking status in switzerland , citizens can supplement their compulsory basic health insurance with a supplementary health insurance .
supplementary health insurance rarely includes dental care in switzerland .
yet , we hypothesized that the presence or absence of supplementary insurance was associated with the use of dental care : subscribing to a supplementary insurance ( even one that does not cover dental care ) may highlight a personal health behavior towards preventive healthcare access - including oral health - that is independent of income .
this is in line with previous works from manski et al .
[ 41 , 42 ] .
in addition , it is possible that supplementary insurance discounts the price of certain health services and thus improves the ability to pay for other services like dental care [ 43 , 44 ] .
participants were therefore asked whether they had supplementary health insurance ( yes vs. no ) and whether they received a health insurance premium cost subsidy from the state ( yes vs. no ) .
specific information about dental care insurance was not available .
we considered smoking status as it has been previously associated with oral health and access to dental care [ 28 , 45 ] .
information on smoking status was self - reported and defined as current smoker versus not smoker .
statistical analyses the means and frequencies (%) of study variables were calculated .
analyses were performed using student 's t - tests or anova for continuous data , and chi - square tests for categorical data .
measures of deviation were reported as standard deviation ( sd ) or 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % ci ) .
the cochran - armitage trend test was used to test trends across survey periods .
the cochran - armitage test checks for a trend in binomial proportions across levels of a single factor .
logistic regression models were used to test associations between forgoing dental care and study variables , adjusting for survey year when appropriate .
to test for temporal trends in forgoing dental care while accounting for potential changes in the study population structure ( e.g. education ) , adjusted prevalence of forgoing dental care were estimated for each survey year and non - parametric trend tests were performed .
overall and monthly household income - specific prevalence were adjusted for age , sex , smoking status , occupational position , marital status , dependent children at home ( age < 15 years ) , education , swiss citizenship , complementary health insurance , receiving health insurance premium subsidy , and monthly household income ( only for overall prevalence analysis ) .
temporal trends were tested for overall prevalence and by monthly household income .
variables included in the models were selected a priori given their reported or potential influence on oral health and / or forgoing health care .
trends were tested for overall prevalence and by monthly household income .
the collection of forgoing dental care information in the bus sante study was introduced in mid - 2007 .
thus , due to the small number of participants with information on forgoing dental care collected in 2007 , survey years 2007 and 2008 were combined .
each attribute ( including smoking ) was considered both as a determinant of forgoing dental care for economic reasons and as a potential confounder of the associations between other attributes included in the models and forgoing dental care for economic reasons .
only individuals for whom all covariates of interest for the purpose of this study were available were included in the analysis .
all p - values were 2 - tailed with significance set at < 0.05 (< 0.10 for interaction test ) .
all analyses were performed using sas software ( sas institute , inc. , cary , north carolina ) and stata 12 ( college station , tx : statacorp lp ) .
results among the 4,584 participants of the bus sante study , a total of 4,313 subjects ( 50 % women ) were included in the analysis ( table 1 ) .
the main reason for participants to be excluded from the analysis was missing data on income ( n = 259 , 5.7 %) .
the numbers of participants included in the analysis for each survey year were as follows : 749 ( 17.4 %) in 2007 / 8 , 1006 ( 23.3 %) in 2009 , 944 ( 21.9 %) in 2010 , 883 ( 20.5 %) in 2011 , and 740 ( 17.2 %) in 2012 .
the overall mean age was 51.9 yr ( sd , 10.9 ) .
except for education level , the prevalence of the different characteristics considered did not differ significantly across survey years .

table 2 reports univariate and multivariate association of participant 's characteristics with forgoing dental care for economic reasons .
in univariate analysis , forgoing dental care for economic reasons was associated with age , gender , education , household monthly income , smoking status , swiss citizenship , and occupational position .
divorced participants who were not living with a partner had the highest prevalence of forgoing dental care but most confidence intervals overlapped across marital status categories .
participants with dependent children at home had forgone dental care more frequently than participants without dependent children .
participants without supplementary health insurance were more likely to forgo dental care than participants with such supplementary insurance .
the prevalence of forgoing dental care was higher in the presence of premium subsidies than in their absence .

discussion using population - based data from a swiss urban region with a compulsory health insurance system but without a universal dental care insurance coverage , we found that forgoing dental care for economic reasons was frequently reported .
this is the first study providing evidence of inequalities in financial barriers to dental care in the general adult population in switzerland .
the mean proportion of forgoing dental care for economic reasons was , in general , lower than estimates reported in studies conducted in other countries [ 46 , 47 ] .
but , the proportion of forgoing dental care for economic reasons specifically among participants with the lowest income was very close to estimates reported in canada and france [ 20 , 28 , 40 ] , for example .
using data from the 2007 / 09 canadian health measures survey , thompson et al. found that 17.3 percent of respondents had avoided a dental professional because of cost within the previous year [ 20 ] .
we observed an increasing trend among respondents with the lowest income , a trend also observed in the australian general adult population between 1994 and 2008 [ 46 ] .
the high proportion of dental care forgone , and the rising trend among the poorest is worrisome - not only because oral health is associated with a better quality of life , but also in light of the growing evidence linking oral health to chronic disease like cardiovascular disease , respiratory disease and osteoporosis [ 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 , 48 ]. of note , the role that dental health access and visits play within the relationship between oral health and chronic disease is yet to be determined .
income and other factors associated with forgoing dental care socioeconomic status is inversely associated with forgoing dental care [ 10 , 11 ] .
in our study , monthly household income had a linear negative association with the forgoing of dental care for economic reasons , confirming results from previous studies [ 18 , 20 - 22 ] .
in canada for example , where dental care is not publicly covered for the general population , thompson et al. recently showed that compared to respondents with the highest income , respondents with lower incomes were over four times more likely to avoid a dental professional because of cost [ 20 ] .
similar results were previously found by others using different data sources in canada [ 21 , 22 ] .
our findings highlight that persons with lower income in switzerland - who are at greater risk of oral illness [ 26 , 27 ] - also forgo dental care more frequently .
this stresses the major role of income in the utilization of dental care in privately financed dental care systems [ 20 ] .
given the current paucity of data , further studies should be conducted in switzerland to examine the implications of dental treatment costs for low - income families and / or the working poor , similarly to studies conducted in other settings [ 47 , 49 ] .
several factors positively associated with forgoing healthcare for economic reasons in this study are in line with previous reports [ 20 , 28 , 40 - 42 ] .
in particular , after taking into account other factors , not having a supplementary health insurance doubled the odds of forgoing dental care for economic reasons .
this is very similar to findings reported in france [ 28 , 40 ] , and is in line with a phenomena called " unobserved behavior " by manki et al. this study reported that having medical insurance with or without coverage for dental care in a non - universal care healthcare system ( e.g. , united states ) is associated with an increased likelihood of having a dental visit [ 41 , 42 ] .
including information about type of medical coverage in these regression models in future studies could improve the accuracy of any associations [ 41 ] .
in contrast to previous studies [ 28 , 40 ] , but coinciding with a recent survey [ 20 ] , we found no independent association between education level and forgoing dental care for economic reasons , after adjustment for income .
while our reasons for the absence of independent association between education and forgoing care are speculative , it has been suggested that more educated individuals may be more sensitive to the need to use money for other priorities , and therefore decline more treatment as a result [ 20 ] .
a similar mechanism has been suggested to explain the fact that women are more likely to forgo dental care for economic reasons when compared to men ( a result observed in our study , as well as in a recent previous canadian study [ 20 ] and other previous european reports [ 28 , 40 ]) .
the lack of association with occupational position can be explained , at least in part , by the fact that dental insurance is not provided by employers in switzerland .
trends in forgoing dental care overall , the prevalence of forgoing dental care for economic reasons remained statistically stable between 2007 and 2012 , but increased among participants with the lowest income .
our data suggests that the prevalence of forgoing dental care disproportionately increased during these six years among participants with household monthly income < 3,000chf .
the global financial crisis of 2008 and resulting economic downturn in 2009 stalled demand for exports and put switzerland in a recession [ 50 ] in 2009 .
the canton of geneva ranks first in switzerland with respect to the level of unemployment , which increased from 6.0 % in 2007 / 8 to 6.8 % in 2009 and to 7.0 % in 2010 [ 51 ] .
a previous report suggests that the importance of cost as a risk factor for forgoing healthcare increases during an economic downturn [ 52 ] .
our data shows that the 2008 - 9 economic downturn may have been harmful for those with the fewest economic resources .
dental insurance the current initiative in two swiss cantons proposes to improve access to dental care , particularly for low income people , by implementing a publicly funded dental care insurance coverage [ 37 ] .
we lack information about dental care insurance .
dental insurance is a major determinant of dental utilization [ 19 , 20 , 22 ] .
the impact of insurance seems to be independent of income , as suggested by the fact that regardless of income level , the insured utilize more dental care than the uninsured [ 20 ] .
in the context of discussing an implementation of dental care insurance , previous observations suggest that oral health inequalities nevertheless persist in systems with dental care insurance coverage [ 10 , 53 , 54 ] .
this can be attributable , at least in part , to limitations within the dental care insurance coverage policies [ 20 ] .
low reimbursement rates and lack of a full year coverage for some insurance programs ( e.g. medicaid ) are reasons why implementing a dental insurance may not have the expect impact on visits and / or oral health [ 20 ] .
income - related inequality persists even in the presence of dental insurance coverage , as observed by duncan et al using data from the 2009 canadian health measures survey [ 55 ] .
the lack of availability of practitioners can of course also mitigate the impact of a dental insurance .
thus , if the current initiative conducted in the two swiss cantons passes , the quality of the dental insurance that would be proposed in the bill should be carefully examined .
several factors not directly related to insurance such as smoking , low perception of medical need , language and communication problems , and other psychosocial factors also contribute to oral health inequalities in and access to dental care [ 27 , 56 ] .
recent findings from the life - course approach also suggest that a considerable proportion of inequalities around regular dental attendance are already established in childhood and persists throughout the life - course [ 57 ] .
inequalities in adults may then be relatively unresponsive to contemporaneous health policy interventions such as the implementation of dental insurance [ 57 ] .
in addition , difficulties in managing vulnerable patients with high dental needs and lack of compliance with regular care have been expressed by private dentists [ 27 ] .
finally , concerns have been informally raised about the overwhelming demand that could follow after the introduction of a universal dental insurance , the administrative burden , as well as the economic viability and sustainability of such dental care insurance coverage .
thus , in the perspective of introducing a publicly funded dental care insurance that might improve access to dental care in general and among the most vulnerable patients in particular , one should also consider sustainable solutions that incorporate the complicated myriad of contributing factors , rather than just address financial need .
one is reminded that dental care access is not the sole reason for oral health inequalities ( e.g. smoking and oral health inequalities ) .
overall , dental care insurance coverage is probably a necessary but not sufficient action to eliminate oral health inequalities .
dental insurance and global dental health strategy forgoing dental care is associated with poorer oral health [ 28 - 32 ] .
a very recent study published in this journal showed that canadians from the general adult population who reported cost barriers to dental care had more untreated decay , missing teeth , poorer oral health and more frequent oral pain [ 30 ] .
those reporting cost barriers also had a higher prevalence of needing dental treatment [ 30 ] .
currently , the swiss dental care system is privately financed and a meaningful proportion of the adult general population is potentially at risk of forgoing dental care .
while income is a key determinant of utilizing dental care , implementing a universal dental insurance is thought to be the most feasible approach to improve , at the population level , the access to dental care .
such universal dental care insurance should be characterized by conditions ( e.g , low cost - sharing , income - based sliding scale for premiums ) that assure equity in access to dental care [ 30 , 55 , 58 ] .
two cantons in switzerland have recently launched an initiative to implement a dental care insurance coverage that will be supported by income taxes [ 37 ] .
we suggest that in order to better design this universal insurance , relevant information on dental need and use of dental care should be first collected among a representative sample in the two cantons .
for example , reasons for dental non - attendance are various and considerable differences among populations exist as suggested by a recent study conducted among europeans over the age of 50 [ 56 ] .
in switzerland , the most frequently named reason for non attending dental visit was " not considered to be necessary " [ 56 ] .
this suggests that efforts to provide more information about the benefits of regular dental attendance are sorely needed .
integrated into a global oral health strategy [ 59 ] , dental insurance impact could be tested at a population level in an experimental manner .
strengths and limitations it should be noted that the study participants are representative of the general population contrary to studies conducted in dental offices or hospitals , and that the large sample size allows conclusions to be drawn for an entire swiss canton .
however , our results may not be representative of switzerland as a whole , even if it is very likely that results in other swiss urban cantons such as basel or zurich would be similar .
our analyses are also limited by the self - reported nature of the information collected .
the survey included dental care without further information on the nature and / or severity of dental care ( e.g. , preventive versus curative / rehabilitative services ) .
we did not consider psychosocial , communication , or cultural determinants of forgoing dental care for economic reasons as these characteristics were not collected in the surveys .
participants were asked whether they had supplementary health insurance and whether they received a premium cost subsidy from the state ; whether these supplementary health insurances or premium cost subsidies covered , at least in part , dental care costs was unknown .
also , the absence of follow - up surveys precluded us from disentangling the amount of dental care forgone and delayed .
because we aimed to determine the independent associations between dependent children and marital status with forgoing dental care for economic reasons , we did not divide income by consumption units ( such as the number of persons depended on the reported household income ) .
conclusions oral health is part of an individual 's general health , and organization of the public health system should ensure equity in access to health care , including dental care .
our findings suggest that , in switzerland , dental care is not equally accessible across society .
socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals who are known to be at higher risk of oral disease frequently forgo dental care for economic reasons .
efforts should be made to prevent high - risk populations from forgoing dental care .

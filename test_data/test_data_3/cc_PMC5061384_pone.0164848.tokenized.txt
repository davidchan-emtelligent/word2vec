evolution of the twist subfamily vertebrate proteins : discovery of a signature motif and origin of the twist1 glycine - rich motifs in the amino - terminus disordered domain the images for figs 8 and 9 are incorrectly switched .
the image that appears as fig 8 should be fig 9 , and the image that appears as fig 9 should be fig 8 .
the figure captions appear in the correct order .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164848.g001 fig 8 phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate twist proteins .
the outgroup twist protein ( twist _ bb ) is located at the root of the tree .
the analysis shows that the twist vertebrate family underwent a gene duplication event that split twist proteins into two main clades : twist1 and twist2 .
different vertebrate species are represented by the following colors : magenta ( twist2 mammals ) , yellow ( twist2 reptiles ) , brown ( twist2 birds ) , cyan blue ( twist2 fish ) , blue ( twist1 fish ) , purple ( twist1 amphibians ) , green ( twist1 reptiles ) , orange ( twist1 birds ) , red ( twist1 mammals ) .
numbers on each node display bootstrap values .
the trimal package in the gappyout mode was used to trim the alignment .
a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using phylip ( mpiproml ) with 1000 bootstrap replicates .
the program figtree was used to visualize the phylogenetic tree .
sequence names used represent the common name of the species to which they belong .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164848.g002 fig 9 largest principal components of the mmds analysis for the twist1 and twist2 proteins .
a ) two - dimensional plot of principal components 1 and 3 of the mmds analysis .
b ) three - dimensional plot of the most important principal components determined from the mmds analysis .
it can be seen that the twist2 are closer to the twist _ bb in sequence space .
also , that the twist1 sequences show more evolutionary drift over sequence space .

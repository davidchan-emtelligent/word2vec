background the transporter associated with antigen processing ( tap ) is a critical component of the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class i antigen processing and presentation pathway .
tap transports antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum where it loads them into the binding groove of mhc class i molecules .
because peptides must first be transported by tap in order to be presented on mhc class i , tap binding preferences should impact significantly on t - cell epitope selection .
description predtap is a computational system that predicts peptide binding to human tap .
it uses artificial neural networks and hidden markov models as predictive engines .
extensive testing was performed to valid the prediction models .
the results showed that predtap was both sensitive and specific and had good predictive ability ( area under the receiver operating characteristic curve aroc > 0.85 ) .
conclusion predtap can be integrated with prediction systems for mhc class i binding peptides for improved performance of in silico prediction of t - cell epitopes .
predtap is available for public use at [ 1 ] .
background peptides that bind major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class i molecules serve as recognition targets for cytotoxic cd8 + t cells ( ctls ) .
the major function of ctls is recognition and destruction of infected ( e.g. viruses , bacteria , parasites or fungi ) , mutated ( e.g. cancer ) , or foreign ( e.g. transplants ) cells .
ctls recognize short antigenic peptides ( t - cell epitopes ) presented by mhc class i molecules that mainly originate from degradation of cytosolic proteins .
intracellular antigen processing pathways determine the selectivity of peptides which are available for binding to mhc class i molecules and are thereby important targets of ctl responses [ 2 ] .
mhc class i antigen processing pathway steps include proteosomal cleavage of proteins into shorter peptides , translocation of peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) by tap , optional er trimming by aminopeptidases , insertion of peptides into the binding groove of mhc molecules , and transport of peptide / mhc complexes to the cell surface for presentation to ctls [ 3 ] .
tap is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of antigenic peptides into the er. tap demonstrates peptide binding selectivity and the affinity of a particular peptide for tap influences the probability of its presentation by mhc class i molecules .
peptides that are 8 - 16 amino acids long and have sufficient binding affinity are efficiently translocated by tap into the er , while longer peptides may be transported but with lower efficiency [ 4 ] .
human tap ( htap ) is a heterodimer that has two subunits htap1 and htap2 .
tap belongs to the atp - binding cassette transporters and each subunit protein has one transmembrane domain and one atp - binding binding domain .
the genes for human tap1 and tap2 are located in the mhc ii locus of chromosome 6 and comprise 10 kb each [ 5 ] .
a more detailed description of function , structure , expression of tap can be found in [ 6 ] .
the efficiency of tap - mediated translocation of a peptide is proportional to its tap - binding affinity [ 7,8 ] .
mutations , such as premature stop codons , or deletions of either htap1 or htap2 impair peptide transport into er and result in a significant reduction of surface expression of peptide / mhc complexes [ 9 ] .
tap deficient cells have low cell - surface hla class i expression shown to range from 10 % ( hla - a2 ) to 3 % , ( hla - b27 and - a3 ) [ 10 ] .
the majority of the peptides presented by hla class i on cell surface are thus dependent on tap .
identification of t - cell epitopes is a highly combinatorial problem .
the diversity of human immune responses to t - cell epitopes originates from two sources - high allelic variation of the host ( both hla molecules and t - cell receptors ) and high variation of target antigens , particularly those derived from viruses .
computational models are routinely used for pre - screening of potential t - cell epitopes and minimization of the number of necessary experiments .
most developments have focused on modeling and prediction of peptide binding to mhc molecules [ see [ 11 ]] .
amongst computational models of peptide binding to htap that have been developed are binding motifs [ 7 ] , quantitative matrices [ 12 - 14 ] , artificial neural networks ( ann ) [ 12,15 ] , and support vector machines ( svm ) [ 16 ] .
combined computational methods that integrate multiple critical steps - proteasome cleavage , tap transport , and mhc class i binding have been proposed as a supporting methodology for prediction of high probability targets for therapeutic peptides and vaccines [ 17 ] .
several combined computational applications of models of antigen processing and presentation have been reported [ 18 - 22 ] .
testing results indicate that these predictions produce a lower incidence of false positives and reduce the number of experiments required for identification of t - cell epitopes .
however , these combined predictions need to be taken with a dose of caution .
alternative pathways for both proteolytic degradation [ 23 ] and tap transport [ 24 ] have been reported .
in some cases tap - deficient individuals have normal immune responses [ 25 ] , suggesting that tap - independent immune responses are sufficient to provide effective protection from some intracellular pathogens .
nevertheless , the proteasome - tap - mhc class i pathway is responsible for 90 - 97 % of expression of peptide / mhc class i complexes and therefore is critical for the identification of target epitopes for immunotherapies and vaccines .
we developed predtap , a computational system that predicts peptides binding to htap .
it uses ann and hidden markov models ( hmm ) as predictive engines .
extensive testing was performed to validate the prediction models and ensure that predtap is both sensitive and specific .
predtap is available for public use at [ 1 ] .
materials and methods training dataset there are 493 nonamer peptides in the training dataset ( table 1 ) [ 12,15 ] .
a single duplicate peptide was removed from the data set reported in the original references .
the binding scores range from zero to ten .
scores 7 - 10 denote high peptide / tap binding affinity , 5 - 6 moderate binding affinity , 3 - 4 low binding affinity and scores 0 - 2 denote non - binding .
the dataset is available in the supplementary materials .
table 1 number of peptides in the training dataset binding affinity number of peptides 0 26 1 52 2 48 3 48 4 53 5 55 6 40 7 87 8 61 9 16 10 7 sum 493 artificial neural network 3 - layer backpropagation ann models ( in - house software ) were used for the development of the predtap server .
the learning method was error backpropagation with a sigmoid activation function .
the inputs to the ann were the binary strings representing nonamer peptides .
there are twenty naturally - occurring amino acids encoded by the standard genetic code .
each amino acid in a nonamer peptide can be encoded as a binary string of length 20 with a unique position set to " 1 " and other positions set to " 0 " , resulting in a binary string of length 180 to represent the nonamer .
for example the first two amino acids , by alphabetic order , alanine ( a ) and cysteine ( c ) are encoded by 10000000000000000000 and 01000000000000000000 respectively , and the last amino acid tyrosine ( y ) is encoded by 00000000000000000001 .
the outputs were binding scores ranging from zero to ten .
the higher the score , the higher the possibility of the peptide being a tap binder .
two ann architectures were used , 180 - 2 - 1 and 180 - 1 - 1 .
the maximum number of the ann training cycles was set to 300 .
the training was repeated for four times , and four sets of weights were obtained .
the value of momentum was 0.5 and of learning rate 0.2 .
the error threshold for stopping training was 0.01 .
hidden markov model hmms have been applied successfully in prediction of hla class i - binding peptides [ 26,27 ] .
an hmm is defined by a finite set of states representing possible states of the modeled system .
some of these states may be directly observable , but some are not , and are denoted as hidden .
biological problems are often sequential and hmm frequently utilize sequential ordering of system states .
a change ( transition ) of the system from one state to another is governed by statistical regularities .
the probability distribution of the system states can be estimated from the data .
in the present study , we used a first - order hmm , in which the current system state is determined only by the preceding state , as described in [ 26 ] .
cross - validation cross - validation is a method for error rate estimation .
it implements a simple idea : the dataset of size n samples is partitioned into two parts , the model parameters are estimated using one set and the goodness - of - fit criterion evaluated on the second set .
the cross - validation estimates the goodness - of - fit criterion .
cross - validation tends to overfit when selecting a correct model - it may choos an overly - complex model for the given dataset .
there is some evidence that for model selection multifold cross - validation , where more than one samples are deleted form the training set in each comparison , performs better than a simple leave - one - out cross - validation [ 28 ] .
in our experiments , 10 - fold cross - validation was performed to evaluate the performance of the classifiers .
prediction performance measurement the predictive performance of the models was evaluated by sensitivity ( se ) and specificity ( sp ) measures .
sensitivity , se = tp /( tp + fn ) , indicates percentage of correctly predicted binders , where tp stands for number of true positive predictions ( experimental binder predicted as binder ) and fn stands for number of false negative predictions ( experimental binder predicted as non - binder ) .
specificity , sp = tn /( tn + fp ) , indicates percentage of correctly predicted non - binders , where tn stands for number of true negative predictions ( experimental non - binder predicted as binder ) and fp stands for number of false positive predictions ( experimental non - binder predicted as binder ) .
for the studied problem , we consider values of sp > 0.8 useful in practice .
the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve analysis provided a measure for overall prediction accuracies of prediction models [ 29 ] .
the roc curve is generated by plotting se against ( 1 - sp ) for various classification thresholds .
as a rough guide , the area under roc ( aroc ) value 1.0 represents a perfect prediction , values 0.9 to 1.0 represent excellent accuracy , 0.8 to 0.9 represent good accuracy , 0.7 to 0.8 represent marginal accuracy , 0.5 to 0.7 represents poor accuracy , while 0.5 represent predictions that indicate random choice [ 29 ] .
the prediction performance of predtap ( ann & hmm ) was compared with that of publicly available predictive systems , tappred ( svm & cascade svm ) [ 16 ] and svmtap [ 19 ] .
three proteins , human papillomavirus type 16 e6 ( p03126 ) with experimentally identified hla - a3 binders [ 30 ] , e7 ( p03129 ) with a single hla - a3 binder [ 30 ] peptides and human cancer antigen km - hn - 1 ( np _ 689988.1 ) with three hla - a24 restricted t - cell epitopes [ 31 ] , were used and the predicted tap binders were compared with the hla binding peptides .
normalization of prediction scores brusic et al .
[ 15 ] showed that ann models were skewed with a tendency to center - shift prediction of both very low and very high tap binders .
to obtain prediction scores evenly distributed in the range 0 - 10 , we have implemented prediction score normalization .
the raw prediction scores produced by hmm methods are not within the range 0 - 10 .
score mapping is also necessary to bring final prediction scores within the range 0 - 10 .
the mapping of scores was done according to equation : scoren = ( score - scoremin ) / ( scoremax - scoremin ) x 10 scoren denotes the normalized score , score denotes the raw prediction score , scoremin and scoremax denote the minimum and maximum values of the raw scores .
the values for scoremin and scoremax were obtained using extensive simulation .
more than 5000 randomly selected nonamer peptides were used for prediction using the ann / hmm models .
since the testing data contains large number of nonamer peptides , the highest and lowest predicted score from the testing data were taken as reasonable maximum and minimum scores for normalization .
implementation the web interface of predtap uses a set of graphical user interface forms .
the interface was built using a combination of perl , cgi and c programs .
predtap has been implemented in the sunos 5.9 unix environment .
model validation assessment of predictive accuracy was carried out for three subsets of peptide binders : 1 ) all binders including low , moderate and high binders were considered as positive samples , and all non - binders as negative samples ( referred to as the lmh set ) ; 2 ) moderate and high binders were considered as positive samples , all non - binder and low binders as negative samples ( referred to as the mh set ) , and 3 ) only high binders were considered as positive samples , with all other peptides as negative samples ( referred to as the h set ) .
the aroc values of ann and hmm models are shown in table 2 .
all models showed very good predictive performance .
for mh set and h set , ann models showed excellent performance with aroc values above 0.9 .
for lmh set , the aroc values of ann models are above 0.85 .
ann with structure 180 - 2 - 1 showed slightly better performance than that of ann with structure 180 - 1 - 1 .
thus ann with structure 180 - 2 - 1 was adopted in our system .
the performance of hmm model is also good with aroc values above 0.85 .

the specificity / sensitivity plot of the hmm prediction model can be viewed at supplementary materials b [ 1 ] .
sensitivities and specificities of ann and hmm models at various thresholds ( based on normalized scores ) in 10 - fold cross - validation experiments are shown in figures 1 and 2 .
we selected the normalized score of 6.0 as a reasonable selection threshold , with peptides with scores >= 6.0 predicted as tap binders .
in table 3 , the sensitivities and specificities of ann and hmm models at the selection threshold 6.0 are shown .
ann model managed to correctly predict 88 % of high binders at the cost of 11 % of false positives ( the 11 % also includes moderate and low - affinity binders ) ; 67 % moderate and high binders with 3 % false positives in the mh set , and 50 % of all binders ( low , moderate and high ) with practically no false positives ( table 3a ) .
the specificities of ann model for all three sets ( lmh , mh and h sets ) are high ( 1.00 , 0.97 , 0.89 respectively ) , which indicates that 6.0 is a stringent selection threshold and the false positive rate is very low at this threshold .
at threshold 6.0 , hmm model managed to correctly predict 91 % of high binders with 32 % false positives , 81 % moderate and high binders with 19 % false positives , and 66 % of all binders ( low , moderate and high ) with 14 % false positives ( table 3b ) .
the specificity of the hmm model for lmh set was 0.86 , higher than that of mh set which was 0.81 .
the specificity of the hmm model for mh set is much higher than that of h set , which was 0.68 .
it implies that hmm model was able to select binders ( low , moderate and high binders ) with low false positive rate , but it failed to categorize them into subgroups - low , moderate or high binders .

the tests were conducted three times for each ann and hmm methods .
the aroc values of ann and hmm models are shown in table 4 .
despite smaller training datasets being used ann models continued to show excellent performance with aroc values above 0.9 for h and mh sets and good performance with aroc values above 0.85 for lmh set .
the performance of hmm model is also good with aroc values above 0.85 .
the performance of hmm dropped slightly with aroc values above 0.85 for h and mh sets and above 0.80 for lmh set .

rather , we compared the predictions on human papillomavirus type 16 e6 and e7 and the amino acid positions of top 5 % predicted tap binders were shown in tables 5 and 6 .
half of the experimental hla - a3 binders overlapped predicted tap - binders .
as suggested by previous studies [ 15,32 ] hla - a3 binding peptides have high affinity to tap , in agreement with our results .
the svmtap , tappred ( svm ) , and predtap ( ann & hmm ) predicted similar sets of tap - binding peptides while tappred ( cascade svm ) predictions were different ( table 5 ) .
a single hla - a3 binder from e7 protein did not overlap any of predicted tap binders except for tappred ( cascade svm ) ( table 6 ) .
again , the tappred ( cascade svm ) predicted completely different set of peptides as compared to the other four predictors .

hla - a24 binding peptides have been reported as tap efficient [ 15,32 ] .
km - hn - 1 protein is 833 amino acids long , and we used top 3 % of the predictions ( table 7 ) .
peptide 195 - 203 , which has 8 amino acids overlap to the km - hn - 1196 - 204 , was selected by svmtap , tappred ( svm ) and predtap ( ann & hmm ) , but not by tappred ( cascade svm ) .
peptide 499 - 508 , was selected by the four methods as a potential 16 - mer , also as a 12 - mer by predtap ( ann ) , but not by tappred ( cascade svm ) .
it was shown that some peptides are efficiently transported by tap in their optimal size for mhc class i binding , while some peptides are transported as larger peptides that need further trimming in er for mhc class i binding [ 33 ] .
it is likely that peptides 196 - 204 , 499 - 508 , and 770 - 778 , are transported to er in the longer form and then further trimmed for loading to the hla - a24 molecules .

the sequence must contain between nine and 2000 amino acids .
if the prediction is run with input sequence containing symbols other than 20 amino acid codes ( spaces and carriage returns are allowed ) or the total sequence length is outside 9 - 2000 amino acids range , an error message will be displayed and predictions will not be produced .
the input can either be a contiguous protein sequence ( an amino acid sequence , or fasta format ) or a list of peptides , one per line .
the default selection on the webpage is " protein sequence " ( figure 3a ) , which means the input sequence is treated as a contiguous protein sequence ( carriage returns and line breaks will be ignored ) .
the predtap input processing program decomposes protein sequence ( or the list of peptides ) into a series of 9 - mer peptides overlapping by eight amino acids .
individual 9 - mer peptides are then submitted for prediction .
predicted binding scores for all 9 - mers are displayed in the result tables ( figure 3b ) .
the 9 - mer binding scores are within the range 0 - 10 , the higher the score the higher the probability of peptide being binder .
predtap has an option for plotting the binding scores of all the overlapping 9 - mer peptides as a graph , in which x axis represents the start position of a 9 - mer peptide and y axis represents the binding score of the 9 - mer peptide .
the user can sort the peptides by their binding scores and choose to view only predicted binders with binding scores above a certain threshold ( figure 3c ) .

discussion we have earlier compared four prediction servers for prediction of h - 2kd binding peptides [ 34 ] .
a 121 - amino acid long sequence of the nuclear export protein ns2 from influenza a virus ( genpept accession np _ 859033 ) was searched for 9 - mer candidate binders to a mouse mhc molecule h - 2kd using four internet - accessible systems .
only three peptides were predicted within the top ten candidates as binders by all four methods .
the performance comparison of predtap with svmtap and tappred ( svm ) shows that consensus peptides can be selected by combining predictions .
the examples suggested that individual predictions need to be taken with care and predictions may be improved by a consensus of multiple methods .
a similar situation may be applicable to tap predictions .
hence the combination of ann and hmm predictions in predtap should result in higher specificity ( fewer false positives ) at the cost of slightly lower sensitivity .
the predictions by tappred ( cascade svm ) appear to be of a limited value .
the combinatorial properties of molecular mechanisms involved in antigen processing and adaptive learning nature of the immune responses limit our ability to fully predict immune responses .
combining experimental and computational techniques improves our ability to decipher complex interactions of the immune system .
computer models are used to complement laboratory experiments and thereby speed up knowledge discovery in immunology .
in particular , the number of large - scale laboratory experiments for t - cell epitope mapping can be minimised by the judicious use of experiments aimed at developing and validating computer models .
these models can then be used to perform large - scale computer simulations rapidly and inexpensively .
the hypotheses generated from these experiments can then be retested in the laboratory to confirm their applicability to real - life immunology .
further work will include both the refinement of computational models and scanning disease - related antigens for peptide sequences that show high probability of processing and presentation .
those peptides that are most likely to be produced by proteasomal cleavage , transported by tap , and bound by hla class i molecules are likely to be promising candidates for peptide - based ctl vaccines .
the predtap server provides for the prediction of peptide binding by tap and can be used as a comparison method against other tap - prediction servers .

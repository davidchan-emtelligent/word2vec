evolutionary genetics is a mature field of endeavour , and some of biology 's greatest minds have contributed to the theory of population genetics .
initially , they faced a problem , in that following the rediscovery of mendel 's results in the early years of the 20th century , some saw an unbridgeable gulf between the sudden changes in appearance seen in the mutant forms of peas studied by mendel , and the gradual and subtle changes to evolving populations envisaged by darwin .
the so - called neo - darwinian synthesis linked these ideas by considering the likely effect of darwinian natural selection on variations in mendelian genes , variations which would not necessarily have major effects on organisms' phenotypes .
unusually , for biology , this theory was developed , primarily by fisher , haldane and wright , prior to the existence of data sets to which it could realistically be applied .
as a result , the second half of the 20th century saw evolutionary geneticists' struggle to produce data to test theory .
they were especially interested in polymorphisms - - discrete genetic variations where the rarer type still has an appreciable frequency in the population .
so they studied visible polymorphisms , such as the colours and banding patterns of snails , and polymorphisms in the charges of soluble enzymes , until , finally , abundant dna sequence data became available in the last years of the century .
now , a resurgence of interest in evolutionary genetics can be predicted , since we will have , through the 1,000 genomes project , for example , data sets detailing population genetic variation genome - wide in many species .
we need the tools of evolutionary genetics to describe and explain this variation .
what does the variation tell us about population sizes in the past , and rates of gene flow between subpopulations ?
which parts of the genome have been subject to purifying and adaptive natural selection , and how strong has this selection been ?
recent advances in population genetic theory , in particular , incorporating knowledge that chromosomes include linked sites that are subject to different forces such as selected versus neutral sites , create powerful methods that can help in answering these questions .
for these and other reasons , a strong grounding in evolutionary genetics must be included in all bioinformatics and genomics courses .
educators will find that foundation in elements of evolutionary genetics , by brian and deborah charlesworth .
this thorough and accurate textbook represents a remarkable achievement .
the rigour of the approach is impeccable throughout , and the text makes clear just how many areas of biology , such as sex , genome structure , migration and population variation , and adaptive evolution itself , can be understood only through the application of formal models in which evolutionary processes are considered in a precise way .
most telling , however , is the consistently quantitative approach to data and their interpretation .
while a full appreciation of the book will require some mathematical understanding , the steps required are clearly dealt with in appendices , and the reader is helped by problems in each chapter .
space precludes a full description of such a major work .
the focus shies away from the changes to the genetic material over long - term evolution , and methods in building phylogenetic trees , etc. , but rather concentrates on evolutionary change at the genetic level over the short term , exploring how mutation , migration , natural selection , and random drift shape the genetic variation within and between populations and how data can give insight into the underlying evolutionary forces that are at play .
following descriptions of the measurement of genetic variation - - the theory of quantitative genetics and the theory of population genetics as it can be applied to infinite populations - - the sampling effects that create genetic drift and determine levels of neutral variation are described .
the expected variation between populations , the consequences and causes of sex and recombination , and the interpretation of genome structure in population genetic terms , all of which are found in the second half of the book , represent areas of particular recent interest .
all have been investigated at the theoretical level and much of this theory has been contributed by brian and deborah charlesworth themselves .
an example is the expected , and observed , evolution of sex chromosomes .
if a single chromosome , such as the mammalian y chromosome , determines sex , its presence as a sole copy in the cell prevents it from ever undergoing recombination .
the lack of recombination will attenuate the power of natural selection to maintain genes on the chromosome , leading to the genetic degeneration so often seen .
but the lessons presented in this text and indeed of evolutionary genetics itself are not restricted to students .
in the 21st century there has been increasing emphasis in the need for modelling , testing , refinement and parameter estimation in the biological sciences , as has been captured by the term " systems biology. " however , it is remarkable that many advocates of this approach seem unaware that , in evolutionary genetics , such " predictive biology " has been the standard approach for decades .
in the application of a " systems " approach to evolutionary questions , a danger is that a new systems biology community may spend their time reinventing the population genetics wheel .
but why has evolutionary genetics stood apart from biology 's resolutely qualitative , rather than quantitative , tradition ?
most remarkably , while biomechanics employs the laws of physics , and biochemistry is founded on the quantitative science of chemistry , evolutionary genetics is based on axiomatic foundations that are entirely biological , and yet are capable of precise mathematical formulation .
the rules of mendelian genetics , encapsulated by unbiased inheritance and random mating in a diploid genetic system , predict hardy - weinberg frequencies , the binomial sampling of gametes in finite populations determines the properties of genetic drift , and , with a poisson process of mutation , the complex theory of neutral genetic variation can be established on the basis of very simple assumptions .
however , while the axioms underlying neutral variation are based on the simple biology , the phenotypes , including the darwinian fitness , of genotypic variants created by mutation have irreducibly complex biological causes , and , for this reason , the incorporation of selected variation into population genetics is more difficult .
consequently , selective theories cannot be as precise as those involving neutrality , so selection , as a potential explanation for a particular data set , cannot easily be pitted against neutrality in a symmetrical bayesian framework .
rather , neutrality supplies a null hypothesis against which data can be tested , and data showing the signs of selection can then be used as the basis of estimation of selective parameters .
but , if i have a criticism of the developments in population genetics that this new volume so admirably describes , it is that some selective models are being created axiomatically with , my guess is , insufficient biological input .
an example is the prediction of the distribution of the fitness effects of advantageous new mutations , where this distribution can be derived from fisher 's geometrical argument or , more recently , from the theory of extreme values .
so , for example , fisher 's geometrical argument considers a mutation changing the phenotype , where the phenotype is described by n different traits .
he asks the question whether a random mutation is likely to move the total phenotype in the direction of an optimum phenotype for the environment .
it turns out that when the effect of the mutation is vanishingly small , the probability of a net improvement is around half , but this drops rapidly as the size of the mutant 's effect increases , with the rate of decrease increasing with increasing n. from these simple premises alone can be derived a prediction of the quantitative relationship between the size of the effect of a mutation and the probability that it is advantageous .
but i do n't find myself confident that this derivation , or indeed one from extreme value theory , contains enough biology to be likely to be correct .
nevertheless , biologists must get used to the increasingly quantitative approach that this work typifies .
biology is pervaded by the mistaken idea that the formulation of qualitative hypotheses , which can be resolved in a discrete unequivocal way , is the benchmark of incisive scientific thinking .
we should embrace the idea that important biological answers truly come in a quantitative form and that parameter estimation from data is as important an activity in biology as it is in the other sciences .

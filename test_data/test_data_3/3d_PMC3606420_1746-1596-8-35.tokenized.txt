abstract solid pseudopapillary tumor ( spt ) of the pancreas is a rare pancreatic tumor with low malignant potential .
it occurs characteristically more often in young women .
spt associated with extra - and pancreatic anomalies are occasionally reported .
here we report a case of pancreatic spt with concomitant urogenital malformations including solitary kidney and uterus didelphys in a 25 - year - old woman .
the patient underwent central pancreatectomy , and spt was confirmed with pathological results .
recurrence or metastasis was not found after 14 months of follow - up. virtual slides the virtual slide ( s ) for this article can be found here : http :// www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu / vs / 4264758678755142 solid pseudopapillary tumor urogenital malformation fdg pet / ct background solid pseudopapillary tumor ( spt ) of the pancreas is rare , accounting for 0.13 - 2.7 % of all pancreatic tumors [ 1 ] .
it is unique , has low malignant potential and predominantly affects young women [ 1,2 ] .
radiological and pathological studies have revealed that the tumor is quite different from other pancreatic tumors [ 3 - 7 ] .
but the cell origin of spt and tumorigenesis are still enigmatic .
occasionally , spt has been reported to be associated with extra - and pancreatic anomalies [ 8 - 11 ] .
here we present radiological , pet / ct and histological findings of a case of pancreatic spt with concomitant urogenital malformations .
case presentation a 25 - year - old unmarried woman with no remarkable past or family history of neoplasms was admitted to our hospital due to a tumor located at the pancreatic neck , which was incidentally found by abdominal ultrasound during a medical check up. physical examination revealed no abnormal findings .
there were no abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests such as serum amylase level or tumor markers , including afp , ca199 , cea , ca125 , and ca724 .
precontrast abdominal ct showed a round hypo - attenuation mass approximately 4.5 cm in diameter with clear margin .
after contrast administration , the tumor displayed peripheral enhancement , corresponding to the solid part of the tumor .
hypo - attenuation without enhancement was depicted in the central zone corresponding to cystic degeneration .
pancreatic duct of the upper stream did not dilate .
no parenchymal atrophy or vessel invasion was found .
accordingly , spt was the most probable diagnosis , and nonfunctional pnet was considered as the differential diagnosis .
meanwhile , the left kidney was not found within the coverage of the abdominal ct scan .
later , the patient received fdg pet / ct scan covering from the skull base to the upper part of the thigh for further evaluation of the pancreatic tumor. with regard to the pet findings , the pancreatic tumor showed inhomogeneous fdg uptake ( figure 1 ) with a maximum standardized uptake value ( suvmax ) of 7.5 in the peripheral zone of solid component .
the left kidney was still not found .
interestingly , pet image showed two foci of slight fdg - accumulation at the uterine cavity ( figure 2b ) , and uterus didelphys were suspected .
after consulting the clinical paper of the patient , we found that she had regular menses .
she received abdominal ultrasound , and uterus didelphys was confirmed ( figure 2c ) .
for this patient , pet / ct helped to diagnose the unexpected urogenital agesi , and to determine the stage of the pancreatic tumor as being confined without metastasis .
after pet / ct scan , the patient underwent central pancreatectomy .
gross surgical specimen showed that the tumor was well encapsulated by a fibrous pseudocapsule with solid and cystic components .
microscopically , the tumor was composed of sheets and nests of uniform polygonal epithelioid cells with round or oval nuclei and acidophilic cytoplasm divided by thin fibrovascula stroma .
degenerative changes were seen in some parts of the tumor .
invasion of the vascular space or perineural invasion was not identified .
the proliferation marker ki - 67 index was less than 5 % and cellular atypia was mild .
according to immunohistochemical analysis , the tumor cells showed nuclear type of beta - catenin (++) , cd10 (+) , cd56 (+) , vimentin (+) , and alpha1 - antitrypsin (+) , but were negative for chromogranin a ( cga ) or synaptophysin ( syn ) .
these finding supported a final diagnosis of spt of the pancreas ( figure 3 ) .
the patient had a smooth recovery and was released 10 days after resection .
recurrence or metastasis was not found after 14 months of follow - up. figure 1 the tumor was located in the body of the pancreas with intense fdg uptake ( a - b , solid red arrow ) .
the tumor exhibited hypoattenuation on pre - contrast ct ( c ) , and was enhanced inhomogeneously after contrast administration ( d ) .
the fdg accumulation was mainly located in the peripheral part of the tumor ( b ) , corresponding to the solid part of the tumor with enhancement ( d ) .
only the right kidney was found ( a - d , red arrow ) .
figure 2 two linear foci of fdg accumulation in the central part of the uterus were found in the pet / ct fusion image ( b , blue arrow ) .
ultrasound scan showed two cavities ( blue arrows ) with muscular septum ( red arrow ) ( c ) .
figure 3 a low power view showing the cystic components ( arrowheads ) of the tumor ( h & e , magnification x12.5 , a ) .
sheets and nests of uniform polygonal epithelioid cells with round or oval nuclei and acidophilic cytoplasm divided by thin fibrovascula stroma were found .
pseudopapillary structures were observed .
cell atypia was mild and mitosis was not found ( h & e , magnification x200 , b ; h & e , magnification x400 , c ) .
immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were positive for cd56 ( d ) , cd10 ( e ) , and the nuclear type of beta - catenin ( f ) ( magnification x400 , d - f ) .
discussion spt is rare and far less common than the other pancreatic tumors , including ductal adenocarcinoma , cystic and neuroendocrine tumors .
it is occasionally found because of the vague symptoms , like those of some nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors [ 12 ] .
in our case , the pancreatic tumor was an occasional finding during physical check - up , and was typical in terms of demographic figure , radiological feature and pathological findings .
first , it occurred in a young woman , which represented the typical population .
previous studies have shown that spt predominantly affects young women from 20 to 40 years old [ 1 ] .
second , it exhibited the typical radiological features on ct , including regular shape , well - defined margin and inhomogeneous appearance corresponding to the solid and cystic texture [ 2,3,5,13 ] .
such radiological features are very different from those of ductal adenocarnoma , as the latter is always infiltrative with poorly defined margin and is invasive to the surrounding tissues .
last , the pathologic examination , light microscopy and immunohistological staining results of our case were typical .
the tumor is characterized with fibroscapsule surrounding and varied protion of solid and cystic components showing hemorrhagic changes [ 1 - 3 ] .
under light microscope , the pseudopapillary structures and degenerative changes , such as necrosis , hemorrhage , cholesterol clefts and foamy macrophages , are characteristic findings [ 2 ] .
besides , the tumor cells are characteristically uniform with mild atypia and rare mitosis , indicating its benign entities [ 1,2 ] .
it is relatively easy to differentiate spt from ductal adenocarcinoma based on these histological features , as the latter is ofter more moderately or poorly differentiated and is composed of haphazardly arranged glands admixed with a dense desmoplastic stroma [ 14 ] .
cystic neoplasms , such as mucinous or serous cystic neoplasm , can also be easily differentiated from spt , because they lack communication with the pancreatic duct system and have no mucinous or serous epithelium usually supported by an " ovarian " stroma [ 15,16 ] .
neuroendocrine tumors , especially the well - differentiated ones , are the most important entities in the differential diagnosis of spt , because they may display similar light microscopic features , and neuroendocrine markers are variably expressed in spt [ 1,2 ] .
excep for the consistently negative results for chromogranin a , expressions of other neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin , neuron - specific enolase and cd56 at various levels were demonstrated [ 1,2,17,18 ] .
recently , the nuclear type of beta - catenin has been regarded as an unique immunohistochemical feature of spt as it underlies the genetic mutation of catenin found in more than 90 % of spt [ 6,7 ] .
abnormal nuclear labeling of beta - catenin strongly supports the diagnosis of spt .
spt is largely benign according to its pathological features , but interestingly , it always shows hyper - metabolism of fdg on pet [ 19 - 21 ] , which mimics malignant tumor .
the high cellular density , rich mitochondria and the hypervascular nature as shown in radiological findings have been thought to contribute to the fdg accumulation [ 19 ] .
in rare cases , spt metastasizes to liver or transplants on peritomeum .
in this patient , pet / ct staged the tumor to be confined without metastasis or transplantation , and she had safely undergone central pancreatectomy .
because of the indolent entity , patients usually have very good prognosis with less likelihood of recurrence and metastasis after resection of spt [ 1,2 ] .
different from spt , ductal adenocarcinoma always has very poor prognosis even after complete resection , as metastasis and recurrence are common .
in our case , the urogenital anomalies of solitary kidney and uterus didelphys were incidental findings .
in premenopausal women , uteral endometrium always display physiologic fdg uptake , and can be easily recognized with its characteristically linear shape and central location in the uterus [ 22 ] .
but different from other patients , the patient in this case had two separate linear fdg accumulations at the central part of her uterus , indicating two locations of endometrium .
so uterus didelphys was suspected when we read the pet / ct image and was confirmed by ultrasound .
spt has been reported to occur occasionally in patients with pancreatic anormalies such as pancreatic dorsal agenesis [ 9,11 ] and pancreatic divicum [ 10,23 ] .
there is another report of spt in a young woman with mulvihill - smith syndrome ( mss ) , a congenital mental anomaly characterized by progeria - like aspect , multiple pigmented nevi , mental retardation , microcephaly , low stature and lack of facial subcutaneous fat [ 8 ] .
but this is the first case of spt with concomitant urogenital anomalies .
the findings are very interesting because both spt and urogenital anomaly are very rare diseases .
when they were found in one patient , we wondered whether the concomitant occurrence was just a coincidence .
recently , beta - catenin and wnt signaling pathway has been found to play an important role in spt tumorigenesis [ 7,24 - 26 ] .
spt almost consistently harbors beta - catenin gene ( ctnnb1 ) mutations in exon 3 [ 27 ] , resulting in the activation of the wnt - signaling pathway .
the ctnnb1 gene mutations inactivate one of the glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta phosphorylation sites on the beta - catenin protein , and block the degradation of beta - catenin .
the beta - catenin protein binds to the t - cell transcription factor ( tcf )/ lymphoidenhancer - bind - factor ( lef ) , and is then translocated to the nucleus , as indicated by nuclear expression of beta - catenin [ 25,26,28 ] .
in the nucleus , the beta - catenin - tcf / lef complex activates the transcription of several oncogenic genes , including c - myc and cyclin d1 .
as a matter of fact , activation of beta - catenin in mice induces large pancreatic tumor resembling human spt , presenting in vivo evidence that beta - catenin / wnt signaling pathway plays a critical role in spt tumorigenesis [ 29 ] .
renal agenesis ( ra ) is embryologically associated with genital malformations because wolffian or mesonephric duct has inductive function on the mullerian duct during normal development [ 30,31 ] .
patients with urogenital malformations always harbor wnt muations or abnormal catenin [ 32,33 ] .
besides , urogenital malformations are induced in mice model by variable interruptions of the beta - catenin / wnt - signaling pathway [ 34 ] , but the exact molecular mechanisms are so complicated and far from complete disclosure .
as mentioned above , beta - catenin and the wnt - signaling pathway play important roles in both spt tumorigenesis and urogenital malformations .
we wondered whether the concurrent tumor of spt and urogenital malformations in this young woman were triggered by a primary insult , which subsequently served to propagate aberrant urogenital development as well as spt tumoregenesis , a process in which beta - catenin / wnt - signaling pathway played important roles .
but similar cases have not been found in the literature .
the underlying molecular genetic mechanism and the relationship between spt and the congenital anomalies need to be further investigated .
in conclusion , spt is rare and specific in demography , radiology and pathology .
it is benign and the prognosis is good after resection .
it occasionally occurs in patients with extra - and pancreatic anomalies .
the concurrent spt and congenital malformations might be associated with the beta - catenin / wnt - signaling pathway .
but the association needs to be confirmed .
